the United States Census of 18-0 not available when the first portion of this report 
Was put to press, was 422,739,

461,016. 
Page 86. The number of children of school age in Louisiana, as given in the Census 
of 1880, was 271,414, 
Page 97. The number of children of school age in Maryland, as given in the Census 
of 1880, was 319,201. 
Page 156. The total school expenditure in Nevada for 1880 was $144,244, Storey 
County not reporting, and in 1981 $140,418. The increase noted in income and the 
decrease in expenditure should be dropped.

    One hundred and thirty-one thousand documents have been sent out, or nearly double 
the number of the previous year. For the purpose of obtaining statistics for the annual 
report 8,093 blank lists of questions have been mailed. A large number of similar forms 
have been sent out to secure data required in special publications issued during the year. 
There is a strong desire that this report should appear earlier, and nowhere is it 
stronger than among those engaged in its preparation. It would be more convenient 
to the Office to close the report the 30th of June, and complete it for publication at 
the time of the assembling of Congress, and thus bring so much of the work of this 
Office into conformity with other offices of the General Government ; but this Office 
performs a part only in the great voluntary system of statistics, embracing the entire 
country and all systems, institutions, and phases of education, and has felt obliged, 
at whatever inconvenience, to accommodate itself to the wishes of the more than 8,000 
collaborators who furnish voluntarily and without pay the data on which its reports 
are based. The first report of the present Commissioner was made and presented to 
Congress at its opening substantially as above noted, but the wishes and necessities of 
many of the contributors seemed to enforce the surrender of that method and the adop- 
tion of the present plan. On a moment’s reflection it will be observed that this report, 
comprehending such a vast variety of facts from so many States, cities, and institutions, 
cannot be made with the promptness of a report embracing only a single point of obser- 
vation. It cannot be made like a newspaper report. It is of course obvious that the 
time covered by the report of any institution must have elapsed and the record be complete 
before this local report can be concluded and forwarded. Any one who knows by expe- 
rience the difficulties inthe way of making a State report will understand how much time 
is required to collect the material from all the towns, counties, and institutions and sat- 
isfactorily compile it. After this, time must be allowed for its publication before this

            vI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  central clearing house at Washington can begin, much less complete, its work. It should 
be stated that, late as this report has ever appeared, there have come data for insertion 
after its publication from those who have been most earnestly laboring to get their mate- 
rial into shape and send it forward ; it should be added, to the credit of those who sup- 
ply the Office with its data, that their unpaid work is done with alacrity and that there 
is a growing desire among them to furnish their statistics, accurate and complete, in time 
for this annual statement. It should be remembered also, in this connection, that this 
Office has never been furnished with the clerical force sufficient to do its work, according 
to the judgment of those administering it or of those acquainted with the demands upon 
it. The preparation of the annual report is only one item of the vast amount of work 
performed in it. £

                  The letters written number 4,190. Many of these furnished statistics and facts to edu- 
cational writers and school officials, the results of extensive research and patient labor. 
About 4,000 letters and 2,549 documents have been received; 1,000 volumes and 1,200 
pamphlets have heen added to the library. The card catalogue of the contents of the 
library, which has been in preparation, is making fair progress, and is already of incal- 
culable service in the work of the Office and aid of those who come here to study educa- 
tional subjects.

It may be hardly necessary to call special attention to the totals here and elsewhere 
appearing in this report, save to conform to the purpose that pervades the report in all 
its parts, to leave no reasonable opportunity for misunderstanding its facts. Whenever 
columns are added it will be seen that the totals only include the figures inserted and 
that references and cross*references are so made io the sources of information and the 
details from which generalizations are drawn that there can be no justifiable ground for 
erroneous conclusions. There is, perhaps, no other report made in the country that em- 
braces the work of so large a number of intelligent and critical contributors or that so uni- 
tormly attaches to its statements the name of a person ora place, which subjects whatever 
facts are inserted or statements made to direct personal and local observation and criticism. 
If there is an error or just ground for complaint the Office is sure to learn of it, and from 
year to year it is a just ground of satisfaction to those engaged in the preparation of the 
report that so few errors have occurred. 
By the appearance of the Compendium of the Census before the completion of this 
report and by the courtesy of General Walker and Colonel Seaton, Superintendents of the 
Census, in furnishing additional data, this Office has been put in possession of valuable 
material with a view to the study of the population of the country as regards (1) its 
distribution by nativity, sex, and race; (2) the minor population, and the population of 
school age, its sex, race, and age; and (3) the illiteracy of the minor population, for the 
purpose of showing the extent to which all instrumentalities, public and private, come 
short of the obligation to teach all the youth of the country the art of reading and writing. 
This study has been made under my direction by Dr. Charles Warren, and so much of 
it is inserted here as adds value and completeness to the statistics of education annually 
presented by this Office. The more full and complete statement, it is hoped, will be 
issued at an early day as a separate publication.

XIV " RLPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TABLE 1 FROM THE CENSUS OF 1880. 
The area of the Union, excluding Alaska and the Indian Territory, is estimated by 
the Census authorities to be 2,900,170 square miles, the area of Alaska is about 531,409 
square miles and that of the Indian Territory is 69,830 square miles, or an aggregate for 
the whole country of 3,501,409 square miles. In size and in population we are the fourth 
nation of the world. Probably more than half the English-speaking people of the earth 
live in the United States. : 
The native population of the country in 1880, excluding the two unorganized Terri- 
tories already mentioned, was 43,475,840; the foreign-born population numbered 
6,679,943. The native males exceeded the native females by more than 300,000; the 
foreign-born males exceeded the foreign-born females nearly 600,000; the exact majority 
of all males over all females was 881,857. The white population numbered 43,402,979 ; 
' the colored population, 6,580,793 ; the Chinese and Japanese, 105,613 ; and the Indians 
paying taxes, 66,407. Of the colored population, 14,107 were born in other countries; 
of the Chinese and Japanese, 1,186 were natives; and 1,820 of the civilized Indians were 
foreign-born. 
An examination of the table will show that the females exceeded the males in the fol- © 
lowing States: 
           
   
   
     
       New Hampshire_ 
Massachusetts- 
Rhode Island - 
Connecticut 
New York - 
Pennsylvani: 
New Jersey 
Maryland - 
District of Columb: 
Virginia___ 
North Carolina. 
Alabama 
Louisiana__ 2 
Thus it may be said in general terms that the country east of the river Ohio and the 
lower Mississippi has a slight excess of females and that the rest of the country shows 
an excess of males. The colored population is mostly south of the Missouri, the Ohio, 
and the Potomac, and the foreign-born population almost entirely north of those rivers. 
Indeed, there has been an actual decrease since 1870 of foreign-born inhabitants in Ver- 
mont, Missouri, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, 
Mississippi, and Louisiana.   
1The whole Indian population is about 289,000, according to recent authorities.

  THE CENSUS IN ITS RELATIONS TO EDUCATION. XXI 
TABLE 2 FROM THE CENSUS OF 1880, 
The second table presented shows the sex and race of the inhabitants in the several 
States and Territories. The Chinese were found chiefly in California, Oregon, Nevada, 
Idaho Territory, and Washington Territory. Chinese males exceed Chinese females in 
number ninety-six thousand, thus proving that their stay in the country is only pro- 
visional and temporary and that they can give no ‘‘hostages to fortune.’? The condi- 
tions of their stay in the country and of the further admission of Chinese men in such 
disproportion is a proper subject for national legislation. My report for 1870 contained 
an article on the Chinese migration to this country, in which the chief peculiarity of 
that race was said to be their family life. This is doubtless true of the Chinese in 
China; it certainly is not true of them in this country up to the present time. Indus- 
trious, frugal, law abiding families are the best foundations of a state; but the present 
condition of Chinese immigration is demoralizing to those who come here, destructive of 
previous economic relations, and profitable only to the few great ‘‘companies,’’ who con- 
trol and employ labor purely for their own benefit, regardless of the misery they entail 
on others. 
The white males exceeded the white females 858,830; much of this excess is occupied 
in subduing the dangers and difficulties of the Territories and the newer States. In such 
communities the expenditure of life is as inevitable as in the vicissitudes of war, and the 
bulk of it must be borne by the more adventurous and stronger sex. Several decades of 
years must pass before numerical equality of sex is established. If the relation between 
the two sexes in the colored population be assumed as the natural one for this continent, 
we find that about one million three hundred and forty thousand white males are availa- 
ble, or growing up to become available, for this special conquest of natural difficulties in 
our more recent communities. Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California, Colo- 
rado, Arizona, Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, and Texas show where 
the pioneers now muster thickest. Diagrams Nos. 5-8 display the excess of white and 
colored males and females in the different parts of the Union in an effective way. 
TABLE 8 FROM THE CENSUS OF 1880, 
The third table derived from the Census shows some interesting particulars respecting 
the native population of the country: Sixty-seven per cent. of these natives, forming 
seventy-seven per cent. of the whole population, lived in the States in which they were 
born; these 33,882,734 doubtless included most of the children and more than half the 
women of this country. The other element of the native population comprised 9,593,106 
people who had moved from the States of their birth to others. Surely this is a ‘“‘wan- 
dering of the nations’’ as wonderful as any historian has related. It tends to make the 
people of one part familiar with other portions of the country, promotes friendships, 
relationships, ties of business, political harmony and equity, and in a thousand silent 
ways helps to bind the memories, hopes, affections, and interests of the people together. 
The columns showing the ‘‘net gain’’ and ‘‘net loss’’ of the several States and Ter- 
ritories serve as indications of the relative attractions and opportunities afforded by 
them. Seventeen States and one Territory show a net loss of native stock: their na- 
tive immigration had not equalled their native emigration. New York, though the 
most populous of the States, contributed native emigrants to other States to such a 
degree that her net loss of natives was greater than the whole population of any one of 
fifteen States. Virginia was the next largest net loser of her native stock to the popu- 
lation of other States, but Ohio and Pennsylvania contributed absolutely more than 
Virginia to the native settlers of other Commonwealths. Kentucky, Tennessee, and 
North Carolina also contributed heavily to the populations of other States. Among the 
New England States, Rhode Island had gained slightly, Massachusetts had lost a few 
thousands, and the others had lost many thousands. Yet, by comparing the column of 
foreign-born residents in Table 1 with the column of net native loss in this table, we 
see that in many cases the loss of natives was more than made up by the incoming of 
foreigners. Thus, New York had 1,211,000 foreigners; Pennsylvania, 587,000; Massa- 
chusetts, 443,000; and Connecticut, 130,000.

  THE CENSUS IN ITS RELATIONS TO EDUCATION. XXV 
TABLE 4 FROM THE CENSUS OF 1880, 
The distribution of the Chinese has been sufficiently shown in Table 2. A slight 
examination of the fourth table derived from the last census shows that immigrants 
from the German Empire exceeded other classes of foreigners in sixteen States: Illinois, 
Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Maryland, Nebraska, Kentucky, Kansas, 
Louisiana, Virginia, West Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, and South Carolina. Immi- 
grants from Ireland were more numerous than foreigners from any other country in ten 
States—New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode 
Island, Tennessee, Delaware, Georgia, and Mississippi—as well as in the District of Co- 
lumbia. Great Britain sent the most foreign immigrants to North Carolina, Utah, Col- 
orado, and Wyoming. The British American possessions sent the greatest number of 
foreign residents in Michigan, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Montana. Scan- 
dinavians were the chief foreign element in the population of Minnesota and Dakota. 
Mexico contributed most to the foreigners living in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico ; 
and Florida received more foreigners from Cuba and other West Indian islands than from 
any other source. Attention is invited to diagram No. 12, in connection with this table. 
The number of foreign-born residents from the German Empire increased in ten years 
from 1,690,533 to 1,966,742 ; those from Great Britain, from 766,292 to 917,598 ; British- 
American immigrants, from 493,464 to 717,157; and Scandinavian immigrants, from 
241,685 to 440,262. The immigrants from Ireland numbered 1,855,827 in 1870 and 
1,854,571 in 1880, a decrease of 1,256. The preponderance of Celtic methods and ideas 
in our immigrant population is therefore at an end, at least for the present ; the Ger- 
man, Scandinavian, and British elements will exert an ever-increasing Teutonic influ- 
ence, and will form a strong, sensible, and steady influence to counterbalance the vola- 
tile and brilliant qualities of the Irish blood. The approaching railroad counections 
with Mexico will doubtless encourage an exchange of population with that country along 
our southwestern border. Whether this will be advantageous or not cannot. be foretold 
at the present time. Certainly, the sluggishness of the native population in New Mexico 
in becoming American in feeling or action is not encouraging for the future of the lands 
that they and their congeners across the border have occupied.

THE CENSUS IN ITS RELATIONS TO EDUCATION. XXIX 
TABLES 5 AND 6 FROM THE CENSUS OF 1890. 
The fifth table from the Census shows the age, by single years, of the minor popula- 
tion in each State and Territory and in the whole Union. General Walker and Colonel 
Seaton have wisely reported in this way, for the first time in our statistical history, the 
age of the population under eighty years. Educators will see at a glance how impor- 
tant this is for their calculations and how useful in their labors. 
The sixth table from the Census of 1880 divides the minor population of the States 
and Territories in two ways, first, distinguishing those of legal school age, according to 
the law in each State, from those above and below that age; and, secondly, the number 
between six and fifteen years old (both ages inclusive) from the number younger than 
six and the number sixteen or older. The minors of legal school age in the Union were 
16,265,089, those under legal school age numbered 7,780,150, and those over legal school 
age were 1,189,107. The number between six and fifteen, inclusive, was 11,771,437, or 
4,493,652 less than the number of legal school age.!

1In forming the second column of the sixth table, I could not follow the census authorities in con- 
sidering the period between five and eighteen years of age as the best school age, because I do 
not share that opinion, nor do the laws of the States generally adopt those limits for their school 
ages. The period between the sixth and the sixteenth years (six to fifteen, both included, or siz, 
to sixteen, as usually expressed) is the time that a majority of school authorities believe, on the 
whole, best adapted for public school work, and I have accordingly computed the numbers between 
those ages and inserted them in the fifth column of the table.

The statistics in the above table and in Tables 5 and 6 supply material for reflection 
and furnish an argument that has not heretofore been advanced for the aid of the nation 
to education in the South. 7 
Take, for the sake of contrast, the cases of Massachusetts and Mississippi. In 100 
inhabitants Massachusetts had 57 adults and 43 minors and Mississippi had 43 adults 
and 57 minors. Even if the wealth of the two States per adult capita were the same, the 
adults of Mississippi would be more heavily taxed than those of Massachusetts in fur- 
nishing equal opportunities for education to all the population of school age. Further 
comment on this subject is deferred until a full presentation of the subject can be made 
in another form. 
TABLES 7, 8, AND 9 FROM THE CENSUS OF 1880. 
The seventh table which I present shows, by States and Territories, the number, na- 
tivity, and race of the males of legal school age, the total being 8,167,645, of whom 
6,690,860 were native whites, 358,631 foreign-born whites, and 1,118,154 of other races. 
The eighth table from the Census shows the same facts for the females of legal school 
age, the whole number being 8,097,444, of whom 6,611,147 were native whites, 361,298 
foreign-born whites, and 1,124,999 of other races. 
The ninth table from the Census is a combination of the last two, and shows that, of 
the 16,265,089 minors of legal school age in the country, 14,021,936 were white and 
2,248,153 were of other races.

    XLII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The analyses of population in the foregoing tables and diagrams afford important sug- 
gestions with reference to popular education in our country. 
Our free schools are maintained under independent State systems. Each State makes 
its own school laws, cares for its own school fund, and develops its schools according to 
the intelligence, zeal, liberality, and forethought of its own citizens. The free schools 
have a national character in the sense that they have the sanction of law in every State 
and Territory of the Union, and that, by reason of the migration of the native popula- 
tion, the effort expended upon the children of one generation is likely to find its issues 
in some section remote from that which nurtured them. The similarity of the inde- 
pendent State systems is chiefly attributed to this shifting of the population, the stand- 
ards and methods, good or bad, that are adopted in any one section being rapidly intro- 
duced into the others. - 
Viewing the country as a whole, one cannot fail to be impressed with the great 
diversity of races and nationalities of which it is composed. Four races are enumer- 
ated. Three of these maintain in our midst the relations of family life. Their children 
are to be formed by our institutions, and in turn the future of the institutions will be 
shaped by them. The fourth race, represented by the Chinese, live, as already pointed 
out, in an abnormal condition among us, but our school record shows that they are not 
entirely outside the operation of our educational provision. As the only agency by means 
of which these divers peoples ean be moulded into a homogeneous population, having that 
unity of ideals, purposes, aspirations, and patriotic sentiment which make up national 
life, the schools are emphatically a national institution. 
Those familiar with the history of free schools in America are aware that they have 
developed as circumstances allowed or compelled ; some of their characteristics are acci- 
dental, some represent expedients which long ago served their purpose but remain 
through the natural persistence of precedents. On the whole the development has been 
upwards. ‘This is true of the personnel of the service to such a degree that it may be said 
without exaggeration that the systems themselves furnish the men competent to make 
the adjustments required by our present society, which is larger, more complex, more 
comprehensive than that to which the schools originally ministered. 
The excess of female over male teachers has become almost a national characteristic. 
The excess would naturally be expected in States in which the women outnumber the 
men: a comparison of diagrams 1-8, inclusive, with Table I, Part 1, Summary B, shows 
that it is not so limited. The causes are suggested in the diagrams. The native-born 
‘women exceed the native-born men in 12 of the 13 original States, together with Tennes- 
see, Louisiana, and Alabama. In the northern section of this group of States the excess of 
women constitutes a portion of the white population industrious and intelligent by virtue 
of inherited tendencies and personal advantages. From this excess the body of public 
school teachers is constantly recruited. In the southern section, as is shown by diagram 
8, the excess of native female population is largely derived from the colored race, and is 
not yet available to any great extent for the school service. Louisiana, it will be seen by 
reference to Table I, is the only one of the Southern Statesin which more female teachers 
are employed than male. The vast territory west of the Alleghanies and north of the 
Ohio and Red Rivers has an excess of male population ; nevertheless, with the exception 
of Arkansas and Missouri (States having a large proportion of colored people), each of 
the 15 States included in the region and nearly all the Territories report a majority of 
women teachers. This is explained by the conditions of pioneer life previously noted 
and by the fact that the moment a new State becomes fairly populous the stream of emi- 
gration sets from it westward, and the excess of male population is gradually drawn 
_ off. In short, the economic and industrial conditions of the developing country account 
for the excess of women teachers. . 
The influence of the foreign-born population of the United States upon its school sys- 
tems is an interesting subject which can only be touched upon in this place. The States

in which the Irish element abounds have had greatest disturbance from sectarian efforts 
to get control of some portion of the school funds, the influence of the Germans has 
been exercised in behalf of better methods of primary instruction, thorough training, and 
high standards in the intermediate and higher grade, the introduction of the German 
language into the schools, and science training, especially as related to the development 
of our internal resoure 
The sturdy industry and stalwart vigor of. the Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians is felt 
with immense effect along the northern border States and Territories. The race that 
produced the Vikings, the Normans, the Varangians, Rurik, Gustaf Adolf, Charles XII, 
Tycho Brahe, and Thorwaldsen has a great future before it in this new continent. Not 
the least of the advantages which attract these desirable settlers into our country are the 
schools. Accustomed by the policy of their own country to the responsibilities and 
privileges of popular education they give hearty support to the free schools of their 
adopted land. The record of local school history shows that the influence favorable or 
unfavorable of the other nationalities represented in our immigrant population has been 
fairly proportioned to their numbers. Through the action of all these various elements 
it has been made manifest thatif proper watchfulnessand activity are maintained by our 
people no foreign influence is likely to overcome that inherent quality of our school sys- 
tems which is not easily characterized, but which marks them as essentially American.

In the compilation of Table I, the returns for the year 1880 were used for Florida, 
Missouri, and Texas. In the first two this was necessitated by the practice of issuing 
biennial reports corresponding to the time of the meeting of the legislatures, and the re- 
ports for 1879 and 1880 having been made in the winter of 1881 those for 1882 and 1883 
will not be due till the winter of 1883. In Texas the records for 1881 were destroyed by 
fire, and though in many cases duplicate returns were made by the counties the totals 
thus obtained fall far short of showing the actual condition of the schvols. 
Two Territories, New Mexico and Wyoming, failed to report for 1881, and the statis- 
tics of the United States Census for 1880 were used in each case. 
Under the head of school population, the figures for 8 States and 4 Territories are from 
the United States Census of 1880, and for the remaining 30 States and 6 Territories 
from returns made by local school officers. As the school moneys are distributed upon 
the basis of these estimates, it is for the interest of every community that they should 
be correct. The general conclusions to which they lead afford additional motives for 
accuracy. A comparison of the returns made to the several State offices with the cor- 
responding figures of the recent census, or an examination of the same in the light of 
well known principles of relation, reveals errors that ought not to escape notice and cor- 
rection by the local officers.

  SCHOOL STATISTICS OF STATES AND TERRITORIES. LUI 
Enrolment in public schools is reported for all the States and Territories. The difficul- 
ties in the way of absolute exactness in the treatment of this particular are well under- 
stood by those experienced in the compilation of statistics. They were the subject of 
debate in the international conference upon statistics held at the Trocadéro Palace, Paris, 
during the International Exposition of 1878, when various methods of procedure were 
explained and many sources of error pointed out. Some of the difficulties brought up 
for discussion are peculiar to European countries, others are equally prevalent in the 
United States ; the most general and constant sources of error with us are duplicate 
enrolments, caused by the removal of scholars from one school to another without formal 
notice, and the omission of entire districts in the enumeration. 
Under ordinary conditions school enrolment increases with school population. Both 
these totals show increase in 1881 over the same for 1880, but the returns from several 
States represent population and enrolment as changing inversely. Where this anomaly 
really occurs the causes should be sought for and set forth, if possible. 
The average daily attendance for 34 States is 5,595,329 ; the four States failing to 
report under this head are Arkansas, Delaware, South Carolina, and Texas. Supposing 
the average daily attendance in each of these States to be the same percentage of the 
enrolment in each that the total average attendance in 34 States is of the enrolment in 
34, we obtain an estimated average attendance for the four States of 268,866. So with 
the Territories: Dakota and the Creek Nation in the Indian Territory fail to report this 
item. Estimating the average daily attendance for the non-reporting Territories by the 
rule given above we have an estimated total for the Territories specified of 18,637. 
The statistics of average daily attendance are then : States reported (34), 5,595,329 ; 
estimated, as explained above (4), 268,866. ‘Territories reported (8 and 4 tribes ot 
Indian Territory), 69,027; estimated as explained (Dakota and Creeks in Indian Terri- 
tory), 18,637. 
Thirty-one States and 4 Territories report an expenditure for sites, &c., of $10,502,036; 
28 States and 4 Territories report $1,151,804 expended for salaries of superintendents. 
Three States do not separate this item of expenditure from the amount expended for sala- 
ries of teachers. Thirty-four States and 7 Territories report an amount expended for 
salaries of teachers of $55,291,022; 32 States and 6 Territories report a miscellaneous 
expenditure (i. e., for fuel, light, rent, repairs, &c.) of $14,603,659. Thirty-eight 
States and 10 Territories report the item of total expenditure for public schools, 
amounting to $85,111,442. 
Thirty-one States and 8 Territories report the value of school property; Connecticut, 
Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Texas, and Vermont are the States and 
Idaho and the Indian Territory the Territories failing to report this very important 
item. 
The amount of school fund in the States, $123,083,786, includes the estimated fund 
in Ohio, omitted in 1880, which in 1876 was $3,742,760 and is now believed to amount 
to $3,795,206. 
The United States deposit fund in New York, amounting to $4,014,521, which has 
been included in the statement of the permanent school fund for several years, is omit- 
ted for 1881, The superintendent writes that by legislative enactment the income of 
this fund is devoted to educational purposes, though the capital is not a school fund 
under any provision of the constitution. f 
The decrease in the permanent school fund in the Territories is apparent only, the 
reports for several previous years from the Indian Territory having included the national 
funds or general tribal funds, part interest of which could be devoted to school pur- 
poses. One million eighty-nine thousand and fifteen dollars, therefore, represent a small 
fund of the District of Columbia and the school funds only of the Cherokee, Choctaw, 
and Creek Indian tribes. 
All the States and Territories report in some form the item of income, that for Massa- 
chusetts being exclusive of receipts for permanent purposes, that for Dakota being a
-P-A-G-E-54
LIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
report of 25 only out of 49 counties. It is estimated that a full report would make 
the total revenue for Dakota over $500,000. The school income for the five civilized 
tribes is the amount given as total expenditures, which, however, it is stated was derived 
from tribal funds. A study of Table I of the appendix’ will also show that in some 
States the total current income includes a balance on hand from the last school year. 
The amount thus included is $2,104,301, which subtracted from the total reported income 
for 38 States leaves a total current income for the States of $84,364,448, and subtracted 
from the grand total leaves $86,037,787 as the total current income for public schools of 
the country. 
The difference between cities and rural districts with respect to the conditions affect- 
ing education calls for a corresponding distinction in education reports. This classification 
is observed to some extent in State reports, but not so generally nor so completely as the 
interests of the rural schools require. 
Graded and ungraded schools are expressions nearly synonymous with city and rural 
schools. Rhode Island is the only State reporting the two classes separately in which 
the graded are in excess of the ungraded schools, the numbers being, respectively, 536 
and 294. The numbers reported from Michigan, viz, 6,115 ungraded and 411 graded, 
represent, it is believed, more nearly the proportions that obtain throughout the country. 
Thus it will be seen that, while the city schools attract more attention, the rural 
schools affect a larger proportion of our youth, which fact alone gives a reason for the 
separate representation of their enrolment, attendance, resources, and general conduct. 
Information as to the funds available for their useis especially desirable. It can hardly 
be doubted that an annual statement under this head would have the effect of stimulat- 
ing local effort and of promoting a more uniform distribution of school moneys. The 
increase of the means of education among our rural population and the improvement of 
the existing schools are matters of such great importance that it is incumbent upon school 
officers to present all information bearing upon the subject in the clearest possible light. 
As expressed in the report of the Massachusetts board of education — 
This material of clear fact is needed as the basis of the most judicious legislation. It 
is required as the means of testing finally the value of particular theories, methods, or 
appliances. And, altogether, it may be doubted whether any very great further advance 
can be made in our educational system until this record of oe actually accomplished 
is in some better degree made up and set before us. ~ 
THE DISTRICT SYSTEM. 
The year has been characterized by active measures against the ‘‘ district school sys- 
tem.’’ The system exists under various names, but has everywhere the same general 
character and the same unfortunate effects. Under its operations a State becomes an 
assemblage of small independent districts, which may be subdivisions of existing civil 
units or formed irrespective of such units, according to the pleasure of the citizens with 
whom the motion for a school district originates. Each district has its separate body of 
officers intrusted to a greater or less degree with the management of its school affairs. 
These officers, termed directors, trustees, &c., are sometimes appointed by the county 
boards or superintendents of education, but are more generally elected by the voters of 
their respective districts, and their constituencies are so small that they must be said to 
represent individual dispositions, opinions, and prejudices, rather than public sentiment 
or policy. They hold office from one to four years, too often have no qualification for their 
duties, and are always comparatively irresponsible. The system had its advantages in the 
early period of public school effort, especially while public funds were largely supple- 
mented by tuition fees, but in the present stage of popular education it has no advantages 
that offset its evils, and none that may not be preserved under a system which makes the 
school district coincident with the smallest civil district, as in Pennsylvania and Indiana. 
In Alabama the township was made the unit of the school system by the act approved by 
the general assembly February 7, 1879. The excellent effects of the legislation are freely 
admitted in the current reports. A bill for the abolition of the district system is now  
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE DISTRICT SCHOOL SYSTEM. LV 
before the Massachusetts legislature and will undoubtedly pass during the present ses- 
sion. The following extracts from reports of the year indicate the prevailing opinion of 
State superintendents upon the subject: 
One-third of the schools of the State do not number more than twelve and nearly 
one-ninth do not number more than six scholars. This is a troublesome fact when we 
reflect that such schools, as a rule, must be very short and inferior. The want of money 
in such districts necessitates the employment of low priced and hence poor or inexperi- 
enced teachers. If for any reason a good teacher consents to instruct, the lack of num- 
bers fails to impart the inspiration necessary to the best work. Besides, the intercourse 
and competitions of a large school, which are potent factors in education, are lost to 
‘children so circumstanced. An opportunity for an equable distribution of intelligence 
and a fair development of faculties among all the members of society is a chief purpose 
of public instruction. Our district system at present seems to defeat this object. We 
refuse to unite or abolish districts, but find it hard to defend, on considerations of public 
welfare, a scheme which gives forty weeks of schooling to one child and only four to 
another.—(Report of Hon. J. W. Patterson, superintendent of public instruction, New 
Hampshire. ) 
The present system in the rural districts of Ohio seems to tend to evils which only 
very positive and persistent effort will even measurably remedy, so long as this system 
subsists. A very few of these evils may be more directly referred to, so that, if the 
system continues, special effort may, if possible, be made to avoid them. 
Owing to changes in the population of some localities, many of the subdistricts now 
enumerate but five, seven, ten, or fifteen children, and schools are actually kept up with 
only two or three pupils in average attendance, leaving them whole days and weeks 
without any pupils. This exhausts the money of the townships and tends to deprive 
the boards of the means of supplying such advantages as are needed for advanced pupils. 
The diminutive schools occasion very little interest or profit. 
Each school being entirely isolated in its work of instruction, old methods of disci- 
pline and teaching are likely to be perpetuated indefinitely ; this, too, in their most ob- 
jectionable forms, the spirit having died out of these methods, the form alone remaining. 
Local interests being given full sway under this very local management, this evil is per- 
petuated by the common and growing practice of employing as teachers only those who 
have secured all the education they have in these schools themselves. * * * 
These difficulties are also aiding to promote another serious evil: the growing desire 
for carving special districts out of the more populous and wealthy parts of the townships, 
thus leaving the subdistricts disconnected, often poor, and for all time incapable of any 
common interest. In some cases townships are cut across, or even diagonally, in this 
way. Cases have even occurred where all but a single poor subdistrict were absorbed 
in special districts. Thelaw now renders this disintegration easy, and the evil is beecom- 
ing so serious as to demand careful consideration.—(Report of Hon. D. F. De Wolf, State 
commissioner of common schools, Ohio.) 
Districts should all be governed by a board holding office for a number of years and 
chosen by all the electors in the district. The civil township should be the unit, but it 
should not be subdivided in subdistricts, to be in part governed by a subdirector. The 
only exception to the township district should be the town or city districts, as we have 
them now. * * * 
The objections to the division into rural independent districts are a needless multi- 
plication of officers, for which often suitable persons cannot be found; the unn 
expense of paying so many secretaries and treasurerers; and the inability of many of 
these districts to provide proper school faculties, owing to the lack of means.— (Report of 
Hon. C. W. von Coelln, superintendent of public instruction, Iowa.) 
These opinions, which might be multiplied indefinitely, are summed up in the state- 
ment that the district system is in the way of every measure of progress suggested by 
experience. It prevents economy in the use of funds, efficient supervision, the advanta- 
geous location of school buildings, and equality of school provision for the children of 
different portions of the same civil district. 
‘The system of parish or local boards in Great Britain has giyen rise to similar com- 
plaints, and a proposition for county boards has already been started in influential 
quarters. It is not proposed to do away with the existing boards, but to confine their 
functions to those interests which are purely local. 
In a system of popular education like our own, originating with the people and sus- 
tained by voluntary taxation, the preservation of local interest is of the first importance; 
experience shows that it need not be sacrificed by the ee of the district system,

  REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
QUALIFICATIONS AND APPOINTMENT OF TEACHERS. 
  The means of improving the teaching force in the rural schools has been a prominent 
subject of discussion during the year. The following conditions have engaged atten- 
tion : standards of qualifications, modes of appointment, tenure of office, inspection. 
The standard of qualification for teachers appears to be lower in the United States, 
taken as a whole, than in other countries in which provision has been made for the edu- 
cation of the masses. In England a school cannot receive the parliamentary grant unless 
the principal teacher is certificated or, if the attendance does not exceed 60 scholars, pro- 
visionally certificated. Both classes of certificates are awarded upon examination; for a 
full certificate the candidate must also serve as a teacher and secure two favorable reports 
from an inspector. In France the law requiring primary teachers to pass the examination 
for a “‘certificate of aptitude”’ is not as yet strictly enforced. In Prussia and Switzerland 
admission to the work of teaching is as carefully regulated as admission into any of the 
learned professions. 
The teachers of the United States bear favorable comparison with those of England 
and France, in which countries it must be remembered popular education is of recent 
development; the advantage does not seem to be with us if the comparison be extended 
to Prussia and Switzerland. There are exceptional districts in which the teachers are 
carefully chosen, well paid, and retained from year to year, but in general our rural 
schools are suffering the natural consequences of a low estimate of the requirements of 
the service as expressed in careless appointment, meagre wages, uncertain tenure, and 
absence of systematic, efficient supervision. 
Where the methods of examination and appointment have improved, the complaint ot 
incompetent teachers has not ceased; on the contrary, the examining boards are embar- 
rassed in carrying out their instructions by the limited attainments of candidates. The 
current reports offer much information bearing upon this subject. 
The Rhode Island board of education made a special effort during the year to obtain 
from each town information touching the qualifications of teachers. As a result of the 
inquiry itappears that about 4 per cent. of the teachers employed in the State have had 
a collegiate education; 62 per cent. have had either a high school or an academic educa- 
tion; 21 per cent., normal school training; while 13 per cent. have had only a common or 
district school preparation. Of the whole number 7 per cert. were reported as having 
hhad no experience. The system of examination and appointment in Rhode Island is 
unsatisfactory, but its tendencies are largely counteracted by other conditions, among 
which the rate of salaries must not be counted least. The average salaries in 1881 were 
for men $76 a month, for women $41.89, the average duration of the schools being 9 
months and 6 days. The lowest average salary paid in any town was for men $25.94 a 
month for a session of 7.9 months, and for women $17.88 a month for session of 7.4 months. 
In three of the five counties of the State, the average salaries for men were above $80 a 
month and for women above $30 a month. 
George A. Walton, special agent of the Massachusetts board of eincaitenh comment= 
ing upon the results of the examination of the schools of Bristol County, uses the fol- 
lowing language: ‘‘Let all the towns apply 25 per cent. more to the wages of teachers 
and expend the money in securing and retaining the best the market affords, and the 
schools could be made one-fourth better.”’ 
‘The revised school law of Michigan, which became operative July 1, 1881, introduces. 
an important improvement in providing for the examination of teachers by county 
boards, but unfortunately the decline in salaries, which has worked such mischief in 
the schools heretofore, continues. The average salaries in ungraded school districts 
were, for men, $26.30 a month, a decrease of $1.22 below the same in 1880 ; for women, 
$18.49, a decrease of 26 cents since 1880; the average duration of the schools was 7.4 
months.  
-P-A-G-E-57
  APPOINTMENT OF TEACHERS. LVIE 
The school law of Pennsylvania makes excellent provision for the examination and 
appointment of teachers, but experience proves that the system can effect little against 
low salaries. In his report for 1880, Hon. J. P. Wickersham, the State superintendent, 
says: ‘The character of the teaching done in the schools has greatly improved, but it 
has not yet reached even a medium standard of excellence.’? He speaks from intimate 
knowledge of the facts and his statement is supported by the majority of the county 
superintendents whose reports accompanyhisown. The latter almost invariably ascribe 
difficulty in securing or retaining competent teachers to the low salaries. For 1881, the 
average salaries in the State, excluding Philadelphia, were, for men, $32.64 a month; 
for women, $26.04, the average length of the school term being 6.28 months. The 
reports from Southern States show still lower salaries, with consequences proportionately 
‘worse. 
In Alabama the average pay of teachers in white schools is $22.98 a month; in col- 
ored schools, $23.15; the average total paid to each teacher yearly, $85.30. The funds 
allowed the white schools to be maintained on an average 84 days in 1881; the colored 
schools, 76 days. The impossibility of securing satisfactory results under such.cireum- 
stances was so evident that in many districts the funds for the white schools were sup- 
plemented by voluntary contributions or tuition fees; in some instances the same was 
done for the colored schools. 
The average salary in Mississippi, estimated for the entire State, was $30.05. 
The average salaries in all the States are set forth in TableI, Part 1, Summary B, p. xlv, 
which should be studied in connection with column 6, Table I, Part1, Summary A, p. xliii. 
To secure a general advance above these rates two measures seem necessary: first, a 
fixed minimum salary in each State ; second, increased funds for the payment of teach- 
ers. The former measure has been repeatedly urged upon State legislatures by gov- 
ernors, school officials, and public spirited citizens, but their recommendations have not 
prevailed against the opposition of wealthy districts to schemes of taxation or distribu- 
tion that oblige them to share the burden of poorer districts. The latter measure 
involves many considerations ; that which chiefly engages attention at the present time 
is the proposition for national aid to elementary education. 
All the bills introduced into Congress agree in providing that a large part of the pro- 
posed fund shall be applied to teachers’ salaries, a consideration that adds weight to 
the other arguments in support of the measure. Where the salaries justify the expecta- 
tion of competent teachers, the means of deciding upon the merits of applicants should 
be carefully considered. Normal school diplomas ought to be sufficient guarantees for 
the service, and in most States are so regarded. In the case of candidates who are not 
normal graduates, examination is required. The improvement in this respect is one of 
the most encouraging indications of progress in public school affairs. It is noticeable in 
the constitution of examining boards, in the subject matter of examination, and in the 
gradation of certificates. While no uniform rule can be given for the organization of 
an examining board, experience shows that it should represent a district large enough to 
prevent the undue effect of local influences; that it should have a professional rather 
than a business character, and should possess some element of continuity, in order that 
the matter and standards of examination may not be altered frequently or suddenly. - 
The change from township to county examining boards, the appointment of teachers 
upon the examining boards, and the division of the members into classes whose terms of 
service expire at different dates are in accordance with these requirements. 
In a number of States the evidence of admission to the highest grade among teachers 
48 a life certificate, which is recognized throughout the State and relieves the holder from 
further examination. It is gratifying to observe an increasing desire on the part of 
teachers to obtain these certificates, as it indicates a disposition to make teaching a per- 
manent vocation and gives additional ground for the recognitien of teaching as a profes- 
sion. It is teachers of this class who may be relied upon to encourage the best efforts in 
all departments of instruction.
-P-A-G-E-58
LVIIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The conditions upon which the life certificates shall be awarded are determined by a 
council or committee composed in part of teachers of approved scholarship and estab- 
lished reputation. By this arrangement teachers may exercise something of the same 
control over their calling that lawyers and doctors exercise over their respective profes- 
sions. It will be seen from my annual reports that the professions of medicine and law 
are becoming more vigilant in admitting persons to practice and more exacting respecting 
standards of qualification. The bar unites with the courts in providing methods of ex- 
amination for those applying for admission to practice ; and members of the various med- 
ical associations and faculties of medical colleges are seeking the codperation of legitimate 
State action to protect their profession against incompetent physicians. Engineers are 
taking somewhat similar action, and teachers may profitably follow their example. 
The want of codperation between the appointing and examining powers is a conspic- 
uous defect in school administration and one which ought to be immediately remedied. 
In this connection the statement of Hon. M. A. Newell, secretary of the State board of 
education, Maryland, with respect to the harmonious action of the school authorities of 
that State, is suggestive: 
In the first place the local trustees nominate the teacher, but cannot appoint him nor 
fix his salary. They can recommend the making of repairs on school-houses, but can- 
not order them to be made. It requires the action of the county school board to give 
effect to the wishes of the local trustees in all important matters. If there is a disa- 
greement among teachers, patrons, and local trustees, it may be referred to the county 
school board for settlement. If it is not settled there, there is an appeal to the State 
board. The number of appeals to the State board has been remarkably few; but the 
fact that such an appeal can be made, and that in no ordinary case is any resort to the 
courts of law necessary, has largely tended to promote peace and harmony. The powers 
of the State board are ample. The right to construe and explain the school law and 
settle disputes secures to a great extent uniformity in its execution and prevents petty 
disputations. The authority to enact a code of by-laws for the guidance of teachers 
and county school boards gives elasticity to the management, and makes a biennial re- 
construction by the legislature entirely unnecessary. The majority of the State board 
are necessarily experts in school management ; they know practically the diseases and 
the appropriate remedies. The power which they possess, to suspend or dismiss an in- 
competent teacher or examiner, has never been exercised as yet, because the board has 
not been fully satisfied that there was any necessity to do so. The examiner or secre- 
tary is appointed by the county school board, but cannot be dismissed by them before 
the expiration of the term for which he was appointed. The power of dismissal is 
lodged with the State board. Thus the powers of local trustees, the county school 
boards, and the State board of education mutually check, supplement, and support one 
another. 
A well ordered system of appointment and the union of the various bodiescharged with 
the business interests, the supervision, and inspection of school affairs into an organic 
whole, having vital connection between allits parts, would do much to place the teachers’ 
tenure of office upon a satisfactory basis. These conditions, supplemented by fair sal- 
aries and enlightened public sentiment, would make the teacher’s position as secure as 
the circumstances ofa rapidly developing country allow. 
SCHOOL SUPERVISION. 
Theoretically, a supervising agency is included in the school systems of the several 
States; practically, the service is wanting in the rural districts, with few exceptions. Its 
importance need no longer be argued, as it is admitted by all competent to judge of the 
purposes and processes of popular education: its neglect arises from the want of funds or 
the apathy that can only be overcome by the compulsion of law and the pressure of public 
opinion. The most significant record of the year under this head is in the report of the 
Massachusetts board of education, which body has been earnestly endeavoring to devise 
a plan for the efficient supervision of the schools of the State. It should be premised 
that the Massachusetts board is more restricted inits authority than many State boards, 
nevertheless it illustrates substantially the relation between State and local authorities 
with reference to education in the several States. The province of the Massachusetts 
board is described as follows in the report of 1880-’81:  
-P-A-G-E-59
SCHOOL SUPERVISION. LIX, 
  It will thus be seen that, as to the common schools, the duty of the board is fixed by 
law, and lies almost wholly in the line of gathering and spreading information respect- 
ing them. * * * This is a distinctive feature of the oversight which the State has 
provided for its schools. It does no more, by its own officials, than to cause an inspec- 
tion and report, more or less complete, to be made concerning them. The State ap- 
joints by law that the schools of a certain grade and range of study shall be opened, and 
for a designated length of time, and requires that the children within prescribed limits 
shall attend upon them; but it does not itself undertake directly to manage the schools ; 
and, if they fail to reach such a degree of efficiency as might be desired, the State does 
not attempt, or has not thus far attempted, to do more than to call attention to the 
failure and the means for improvement. The care of the schools, their direct manage- 
ment, and the whole practical control of them rest with the school authorities and 
with the people themselves in each city and town. Thus, in the matter of common 
school administration, the State itself, through its own officials, does little more than to 
observe what is done, and cause it to be known as widely as it may, and to make sug- 
gestions of improvement. * * * 
It is evident that this policy may have its elements both of weakness and of strength. 
It may allow to be left for a long time untouched many errors and defects in the man- 
agement of the schools which might be at once removed if the State were to lay its 
hand directly upon them ; and it may seem thus to fail, and may perhaps really fail, in 
bringing the schools with sufficient promptness to the best attainable results. But, on 
the other side, in its reliance upon the intelligence and carefulness of the people them- 
selves, in their several localities, and through the necessity of working only through 
such agencies, it may secure, in a more permanent manner, the gains that are made. 
After a brief review of what the State has accomplished for the improvement of the 
schools, the report continues : 
We are thus brought to the consideration of a topic which has been presented with 
urgency in former reports; that is, the desirableness of providing for a more efficient 
supervision of the schools throughout the whole State than now exists. It is not need- 
ful to repeat the arguments that have been set forth at length on other occasions to ex- 
hibit the necessity of such a provision. The oversight referred to would be of a kind 
to offer no interference whatever with the full control of the schools by the local boards 
and to involve thus no new departure from that line of State policy which has just been 
sketched. The board does not ask for officials to be intrusted with direct management 
or administration, but officials to carry on further and more fully the work, now in part 
undertaken, of diffusing knowledge concerning the best modes of management and of 
collecting information respecting the actual condition of the schools. 
Itis difficult to see how the number of officers required could be secured excepting by 
@ system of county or township superintendence. Certain facts to which Hon. J. W. 
Dickinson, secretary of the Massachusetts board, calls attention, indicate that this is 
likely to be the issue of the experiment in that State : 
There is a demand for more agents. Until the towns are organized so as to supply 
themselves with special school directors the State should supply them, that the best 
and largest results which our system of schools is capable of producing may be secured. 
Sections 44 and 45 of chapter 44 of the public laws give authority to any two or more 
towns to form a district for the purpose of employing a superintendent of public 
schools therein, who shall perform in each town the duties prescribed by law. Two 
districts have been organized under these provisions of the statutes, Waltham and 
Watertown forming one and Canton and Milton the other. The first named district 
is under the superintendency of Mr. John F. Prince; the second, of Mr. G. I. Aldrich. 
‘These union superintendents are doing a grand work for their districts, and are solving 
the problems relating to district supervision. If all the smaller towns of the Common- 
wealth could be united into convenient districts, and in this way supplied with adequate 
school superintendence, experience is proving that the conditions of good schools would 
be supplied. 
Two such officials, termed agents of the board, have been employed for several years. 
The plan of inspection adopted by them indicates the character of the oversight which 
ought to be extended to all the schools of the country. The following is the outline as 
presented in the report for 1880-’81 : 
(1) School buildings, including site and grounds; size of rooms; lighting, heating, 
and ventilation; furniture and outbuildings, including location, construction, drainage, 
and use. 
(2) Studies, including course of studies (branches); means of teaching, as apparatus, 
libraries, and reference books.  
-P-A-G-E-60
  LX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
(3) Results, including reading, silent and oral; alphabet, with elementary sounds; 
spelling, oral and written; language; geography, numbers, and arithmetic, &c. 
(4) Teachers and teaching; methods of teaching; physical training; moral instruc- 
tion. 
The schools which were visited before this plan was adopted embraced a part of those 
in eight of the cities and towns. Visits to these were made not only for the purpose of 
inspection, but also for the purpose of teaching in the schools and addressing the teach- 
ers and people. 
Efficient inspection of the nature here indicated is the great desideratum of our rural 
schools. It would be a support to the ablest teachers and a means of securing from in- 
ferior teachers a fair average of results. Such a conception of the duties of county super- 
intendents or equivalent officers as is represented in the plan quoted above implies 
corresponding qualifications in those officials. This opens upa matter concerning which 
very crude notions are entertained and very unsatisfactory practices tolerated. The 
various pedagogical associations, which do so much by their discussions and publications 
to promote educational reforms, are giving serious thought to this interest, and already 
measures have been taken to improve the county superintendency in the States in which 
it exists. A bill with this end in view was introduced into the Illinois legislature dur- 
ing the winter. The bill provides that— 
No person shall be eligible to the said office of county superintendent of schools who 
is not twenty-five years of age and who has not had three years’ experience in actual 
school work, either as a teacher or a superintendent of schools, nor unless he shall be 
the holder of (1) a State certificate of qualification granted in accordance with the pro- 
visions of section 50 of the school law; or (2) the diploma of a chartered college granted 
to such as have completed the regular course of academic or scientific study; or (3) the 
diploma of some State normal school granted to such as have completed the regular 
course of academic and professional study; or (4) of a certificate to be obtained by a 
specified examination. 
  COURSES OF STUDY. 
Within a few years much attention has been given to the order and conduct of 
studies in rural schools, and in a number of States definite courses of study have been 
adopted and measures taken for enforcing their use. As regards the subjects which 
are universally included in elementary instruction, viz, reading, writing, and arith- 
metic, these courses differ little from one another or from those employed in foreign 
schools. History, geography, grammar, elementary science, physiology, and civil gov- 
» ernment, as embodied in the Constitution of the United States and of individual States, 
make up the list of additional subjects. In Nevada drawing is included in the course 
for ungraded schools, but, as a rule, that branch and three others which appear in nearly 
all foreign programmes, viz, music, gymnastics, and needlework (for girls’ schools), 
have no place in our programmes. Opinions are various with reference to the relative 
importance and proper sequence of these several branches. The objection has been 
urged against the programmes generally that they include too much for the meagre term. 
of school life. The case is well stated by Hon. N. A. Luce, State superintendent of 
common schools of Maine, in his report for the year 1881. After citing the list,of studies 
required by law, viz, ‘‘reading, writing, spelling, English grammar, geography, arith- 
metic, history, physiology, book-keeping, civil government (in the form of the consti- 
tution of Maine and of the United States), and such other branches as school committees 
may desire to introduce into the schools under their charge,’’ he continues: 
Can this specifically prescribed course of study be completed with any fair degree of 
thoroughness in the average school life of the average pupil? Evidently not. That 
life, five years of thirty-eight weeks each, would, in the very nature of things, appear 
to be too short for such and so much work. ‘The statistics, indeed, show this to be the 
ease. In only about half the ungraded schools is history a study; book-keeping in 
about a third, and physiology in about a fourth. Considered in relation to present av- 
erage length of schools alone, then, the course of study prescribed for them is too exten- 
sive. Considered in relation to the character of the york done in them, too (the teach- 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
COURSES OF STUDY. LxI 
ing), the same is true. Not broad enough, considered in its relations to the work which 
ought to be demanded and which the purposes they ought to subserve do demand of 
the school; and too broad, considered in its relations to the actual work which theschools 
can accomplish in their present condition, the practical question is, shall the prescribed 
course of study be modified to suit the actual conditions of the schools or shall the 
schools be so increased in length and improved in quality as to enable them to do the 
work set for them in that course? There can be but one right answer: the schools 
must be increased in average length, and, for still stronger reasons, their great diversity 
in length heretofore noticed must cease to exist and their quality must be improved. 
Few will dissent from his conclusions. In determining the outline courses, two points 
must be keptin view: first, the branch upon which classification shall be based; second, 
the daily programme. In a graded school the studies are uniform for all the members 
of the same class. In an ungraded school this uniformity is impossible, and some study 
must be selected as the basis for the division into classes. The choice is between arith- 
metic and reading. The latter is generally to be preferred, as children differ much less 
with respect to their capacity for reading than for computation. In arranging the daily 
programme it should be remembered that some studies require more time than others 
and that some are a greater tax upon the mind thanothers. These severer studies should 
be assigned to the hours when the children are freshest and brightest, viz, the forenoon 
and the hour immediately following recess. The chief difficulty in classifying ungraded. 
schools arises in connection with scholars who grade in more than one class. Some 
authorities object to this provision altogether, but those who have the true interests of 
scholars at heart will recognize its necessity; the proper ideal of a school is the greatest 
good to the individual consistent with the interests of the majority, and under this con- 
ception flexible classification must be allowed within reasonable limits. 
Where definite courses of study for ungraded schools have been adopted it is desirable 
that superintendents should embody the same in their reports, with such comment as 
observation and experience may suggest. This has been done in several instances in the 
reports for 1881. 
Hon. W. H. Ruffner, superintendent of public instruction for Virginia, presents the 
following outline for a course of nine five months’ terms : 
GRADED COURSE FOR PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF ONE TEACHER. 
(Completed in nine five months” terms.) 
First term.— (1) Alphabet: by word and phonic method, followed by reading and 
spelling first half of First Reader. 
(2) Writing: making letters and words on blackboard and slate. 
3 Numbers: counting objects; naming and making figures. 
(4) Oral instruction: daily, not only on the regular branches, but on various topics, 
such as correct speech, objects, hygiene, music, morals and manners; and this done on 
Friday especially. 
Second term. — (1) Reading and spelling: to the end of the First Reader. If Leigh’s 
method be used more rapid progress may be made. 
3 Writing: in tracing book and in copying short sentences from Reader. 
Arithmetic: numeration begun, and addition; constructing and mastering the 
addition table; making some use of elementary text book, chiefly for objects and simple 
problems. Where Grube’s method is employed these directions will not suit. 
Third term.— (1) Reading: Second Reader begun; spelling and vocal drill continued ; 
meaning of words determined, chiefly by their use in sentences constructed for the pur- 
pose by teacher and pupils. 
(2) Writing: first copy book and copying from Reader. Blackboard and chart used. 
in illustrating forms and principles of letters. f. 
(3) Arithmetic: numeration continued; subtraction and multiplication; mental and 
written exercises alternating throughout the course; elementary text book in regular 
use. 
Fourth term.— (1) Reading: Second Reader finished, Third Reader begun; spelling and 
defining words in lessons. 
(2) Writing: copy book and dictation from Reader to be copied by pupil. 
(3) Arithmetic: division; fractions and decimals explained in connection with numer-  
-P-A-G-E-62
LXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  ation, but not studied in detail; a few simple denominate tables learned; elementary 
book finished. 
Fifth term.— (1) Reading: Third Reader finished; phonic analysis and defining never 
given up. 
2) Spelling: spelling book begun. 
3) Writing: copy book and dictation; principles made familiar; particular letters 
taught. 
(4) Arithmetic: the complete arithmetic commenced. Mental and written con- 
stantly intermingled. ‘Walton’s tables used. 
(5) Geography begun: oral; globe; points of the compass, practice in direction, loca- 
tion, and distance; local maps constructed; outline wall maps explained; geographic terms 
written, explained, and illustrated by objects or pictures. 
Siath term.—(1) Reading: Fourth Reader begun; constant attention to enunciation 
and expression; use of dictionary as a book of reference taught. 
2) Spelling: in spelling book and by all other means except dictionary. 
3) Writing: copy book and the substance of reading lessons. 
4) Arithmetic: omitting puzzles, repetends, duodecimals, and (as they may be here- 
after reached) the more complex and less used rules, such as alligation and the progres- 
sions. 
(5) Geography: intermediate text book begun; map drawing practised throughout 
the course; good map studied carefully, though not in extreme detail; indifferent or 
inaccurate maps not allowed. 
(6) Grammar: the correction of errors in language used by pupils attended to always; 
systematic oral instruction begun. 
Seventh term.— (1) Reading: Fourth Reader finished and Fifth begun; exercise varied 
by skipping and introduction of parallel reading. 
2) Writing: copy book and letter writing. 
3) Arithmetic: quickness and accuracy in performing the most practically useftl 
operations to be sought rather than following curious details or subtle principles, or 
aiming at going over the whole book. 
(4) Geography: text book expurgated of such details as may in after life be readily 
supplied as wanted, and geographical principles, forms, and outlines chiefly insisted 
upon. 
(5) Grammar : elementary text book begun. 
Eighth term.— (1) Reading: Fifth Reader ; small United States History (200 pages). 
(2) Writing: practice ; study of particular letters continued ; and careful attention 
to details of posture, pen holding, and careful formation of letters throughout the 
course, 
ih Arithmetic : the mental effect attended to. 
4) Geography: intermediate geography finished; and geographical questions con- 
sidered in connection with reading history. 
(5) Grammar: parsing, analysis (diagrams used). 
Ninth term.— (1) Reading: Fifth Reader and History of Virginia; spelling practised 
to the last. 
2) Writing: faithfully studied and practised to the end. 
i Arithmetic: completed. 
  4) Geography: geography of Virginia. 
5) Grammar: elementary completed. 
Mr. Ruffner believes this course to be well suited to the ordinary term of rural school 
education. 
It is impossible to examine the various courses without being struck with the general 
neglect of elementary science. The rural schools would seem to be favorably situated 
for the study of nature in some one of her varied aspects. The well known effect of such 
study upon the mind, its value as a resource to the individual, and its relation to the 
tendency of modern thought are so many reasons for its introduction into these courses. 
Here is a practical matter for the consideration of superintendents, teachers’ associa- 
tions, and the faculties of normal schools, and one whose consideration can no longer be 
deferred if our people are to share in the progress of the age. 
The instruction contemplated would not interfere with what must be regarded as the 
great end of elementary schools, viz, the training of the youth of a community so that 
they may be able to read intelligently, write legibly and correctly, and compute accu- 
rately. Where this end is attained under conditions well adapted to the physical, intel- 
Jectual, and moral needs of the young the schools are a success ; so far as the schools fall  
-P-A-G-E-63
  ILLITERACY AMONG MINORS. LXIIk 
short of this end or accomplish it at the cost or the neglect of the moral nature of the 
young people committed to their care, they are failures. 
The attainments specified are so important that we may well question whether all 
examinations of elementary schools should not be directed simply to testing their effi- 
ciency within this limit; but if such were the accepted criterion there would still be 
large choice of subjects and methods and large opportunity for the study of adaptation. 
If the problem which is before the schools be reduced to the simplest possible condi- 
tions the necessity for definite schemes of study remains. 
The experience of the world with reference to this means of regulating and directing 
the work of schools is illustrated in the following extract from the circular of Mr. Van 
Humbéeck, Belgian minister of education, dated 20th July, 1880: ‘‘Contrary to what 
has been for a long time the practice in all the countries which have at heart the devel- 
opment of popular education, the Belgian government, according to the law of 1842, 
did not deem it necessary to decree a plan of studies for the public primary schools. 
Some large cities, some provincial inspectors, had of their own initiative formulated 
programmes of study ; but in the majority of the communes the teachers were left to be 
the sole judges of the manner of interpreting the intentions of the law on that subject. 
Experience has condemned this system ; wherever the schools have followed definite 
programmes, progress has been marked, while for the most part in the schools left to 
themselves routine has taken firm hold.” The circular was accompanied by a pro- 
gramme of studies to be used in the communal schools. 
ILLITERACY AMONG MINORS. 
In reviewing the educational reports of the several States and Territories the question 
arises in thoughtful minds, how far has the elaborate provision accomplished its purpose 
in the instruction of the young? The statistics of minor illiteracy from the Census 
go far to answer the inquiry. 
TABLES 10 AND 11 FROM THE CENSUS OF 1880, 
Tables 10 and 11 show the number of minor whites of each sex between ten and four- 
teen and between fifteen and twenty, the number of the same unable to write, and the 
per cent. of the illiterate. It will be observed that the percentage of female illiteracy 
is less than that of male illiteracy. Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico are the only 
exceptions in either age.

  BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE EDUCATIONAL CONDITION OF THE UNION. 
NEW ENGLAND STATES — MAINE, 
There was here an evident improvement in school-houses, 180 more being reported in 
good condition. The valuation of school property, accordingly, was $22,934 higher. 
Expendituresand receipts for public schools were also increased by over $41,000; teachers 
received better pay, and 42 more of them were graduates of normal schools, while 4,713 
had had some experience. Hence, out of a school population less by 729, there were 
240 more broughtinto the public schools. From some cause, however, probably from the 
fact that under 20 per cent. of all the teachers were thoroughly fitted for school work, the 
average attendance did not correspond with the increased enrolment, but fell off 3,615; 
the average school term was also 2 days shorter. For the first time we learn that, of 483 
towns reported, 437 were well supplied with text books, that 384 had uniformity in
-P-A-G-E-70

these, and that 37 schools had globes, 1,476 had wall maps, 21 also having charts. The 
superintendent thinks that on the whole there was a gain in the quality of schools, but: 
that any great improvement is impossible till a township system supersedes the district. 
system generally. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
There was here a decrease of 1,106 in public school enrolment and of 5,023 in average 
daily attendance, 730 more youth of school age being out of school, although private 
schools enrolléd 486 more; the average public school term was shortened by more than 
8 days; there was a decrease in the estimated value of public school property, in the 
average pay of teachers, and in the number of these from normal schools. More public 
schools were taught, however; more of them were graded and high, and more were sup- 
plied with maps and globes; 125 more teachers were employed, and 105 more taught for 
successive terms. 
VERMONT. 
Enrolment in public schools was 592 less and in private schools 383 more than in 1880, 
but the average daily attendance on public schools was 1,094 more, an increase.of nearly 
2 per cent. on the number enrolled. Fewer public schools were taught, the term was a 
day shorter, and the whole expenditure $7,033 less. Fewer men and more women were 
employed, but the average monthly pay of men was $1.92 greater and that of women 
60 cents less. The ungraded district schools, which enroll six-sevenths of the pupils, 
suffer from a tendency of the population to collect in business centres, thus leaving the 
rural districts thinly populated and schools generally poorly sustained. Graded schools, 
however, were more numerous and improved in quality. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
The statistics show about 5,000 more children of school age, 18,000 more of all ages in 
public schools, 19 fewer in average daily attendance, 784 more in average membership, 
and. 378 fewer attending private and academic schools than during 1879-’80. More 
pupils attended public high schools and more were in average attendance on evening 
schools, although the enrolment in the latter was slightly less. The number of pub- 
lic schools increased by 431 and the average term by 1 day. The average monthly 
pay of teachers was increased by $18 for men and $7.90 for women, and the whole ex- 
penditure for public school purposes by $619,811. Among other evidences of popular 
interest in the schools the report notes the amount of money raised for their support, 
which allowed $18.47 for every child of legal school age; the large attendance on public 
schools; the efforts teachers were making to prepare themselves for their work by attend- 
ance on normal schools and institutes, and the increase of institutes and similar educa- 
tional meetings. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
This State reports an increase of 804 in youth 5 to 15 years of age and of 386 in the 
enrolment, with a decrease of 120 in the average number belonging and of 279 in aver- 
age daily attendance; fewer public school buildings by 2, but an increase of $60,322 in the 
value of school property; 6 more schools taught, the average term being 2 days longer; 
170 more teachers employed in day and evening public schools and 78 more who had 
been trained in normal schools; an increase of $5.76 in the average monthly pay of men, 
a decrease of $1.10 in that of women, and $5,737 more expended for public school pur- 
poses. ‘The increase of absence from the schools is deplored by the State board, which 
reports 12,730 youth of school age as not attending, while 2,551 attended for less time 
than the 12 weeks required by law. To the evils inseparable from the district system 
the board chiefly ascribes these poor Its, and recommends that municipalities desir- 
ing to do so be allowed to abolish th tem; also, that there be a more effective compul- 
sory attendance law and better local supervision.

PRESENT EDUCATIONAL CONDITION. LXXIi 
CONNECTICUT. 
There was here an increase of 3,510 in youth 4 to 16 years of age, but the enrolment 
in public schools and in schools of all kinds decreased, and more children of school 
age by 3,980 did not attend any school. Stili, more public schools were taught, the 
expenditure for them was $68,316 greater, and the average term was a little longer. Six 
more schools were graded; and, although 4 fewer houses were built, 10 more were re- 
ported in good or fair condition. The decrease in attendance shown will not, it is claimed, 
justify the inference that education was considered less important than heretofore. It 
is thought that the attendance on private schools was greater than the number given, 
these schools not being required by law to report to the school authorities. The decrease 
in public school enrolment is explained by the facts (1) that increased business prosper- 
ity caused more youth of school age to be withdrawn for work and (2) that a larger 
number than usual of children under 5 were excluded. Almost all the youth 8 to 14 
were, it is believed, in attendance on some school for a portion of the year. 
    MIDDLE ATLANTIC § 
  ‘ATES — 
  W YORK. 
With an increase of nearly 21,000 in the number of youth 5 to 21 years of age, there 
was a decrease of over 10,000 in public school enrolment and of over 13,000 in average 
daily attendance, private school attendance having also decreased slightly. This de- 
cline in school attendance is ascribed by the superintendent to the business activity of 
the year, which led many of the youth over 14 to leave school for work. He thinks the 
schools increased in efficiency in greater proportion than the attendance fell off, and that 
the results attained justified the expenditure, which was $511,026 greater than the pre- 
vious year. ‘There were 205 more pupils in academies, 191 more in normal schools, 2,610 
more in colleges, 490 more in medical schools, and 50 fewer in law schools, the total loss 
in attendance on all classes being 7,123. The figures show a smaller number of public 
school-houses, but a greater estimated value of school property ; 28,498 fewer volumes 
in district school libraries ; an average school term 1 day shorter ; fewer men and more 
women teaching, but a slight increase in their average pay ; 27 more teachers licensed 
through normal schools, 188 more by local officers, and 119 fewer by the State superin- 
tendent. 
NEW JERSEY. 
For the first time in many years there appear evidences of decline in school work. 
With an increase of 4,946 in the number of youth 5 to 18 years of age, there was a de- 
crease of 1,419 in the number attending public schools (with 126 more in private or 
church schools), the average daily attendance on public schools being 5,142 less and the 
number not in any school 5,995 greater. The average public school term was 2 days 
shorter and the average pay of teachers decreased, as did also the number of men teach- 
ing, their places being filled by women. There were, however, more certificates of a 
higher and fewer of a lower grade issued to teachers, and more evening schools were 
taught, their terms being a little longer and the attendance greater. 
PENNSYLVANIA, 
With about a million and a half of youth of school age, there were 931,749 enrolled 
in public and 26,710 in private schools, a decrease for the year of 5,561 in public and of 
842 in private schools. The number of public graded schools increased, as did the 
expenditure for public schools and the value of school property. Throughout the State, 
exclusive of Philadelphia, which does not report on these points, drawing was taught in 
693 more public schools and the higher branches in 82 more. There were more first class 
public school-houses and more with suitable furniture ; fewer were reported badly ven- 
tilated, but more as ‘unfit for use.’? Improvement in the quality of teaching is indi- 
cated by an increased number of teachers with long experience (649 more having been 
employed over five years continuously), as well as by the fact that 158 more had attended 
State normal schools and 138 more were graduates of such schools.

    LXXII COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  REPORT OF THE 
  DELAWARE, 
Here the statistics show an increase during the year of 1,826 in school population and 
of 1,299 pupils enrolled in free schools. The average pay of teachers in schools for whites 
was slightly increased, as also was the number of schools taught, although the average 
term was 5 days shorter. Attendance on colored schools diminished by 226, while the 
number of that race within the school age was 198 greater. In 1881, for the first time, 
the State recognized its obligation to aid in the education of the colored people by making 
an appropriation of $2,400 from the treasury for their schools. 
MARYLAND. 
  This State reports a decrease of 3,522 in the whole public school enrolmeg. 
6,039 in average daily attendance; of 3,293 in the enrolment of colored pupils and 
of 1,167 in their average attendance; of 5 schools taught, but $60,214 more expended 
onthem. A severe winter and unusual sickness are said to account in part for this fall- 
ing off; but the main difficulty in the way of improvement is the inadequacy of school 
revenues. The Census of 1880 reveals the presence in the State of 134,488 illiterates 
over 10 years of age, 90,172 of them being colored. In order to drive this army of 
illiterates from the field more money is necessary, and, as the superintendent says, ‘‘The 
people of Maryland, however willing, do not feel able to increase their taxes.’’ 
VIRGINIA. 
‘With only 858 more youth of school age reported, there was an increase of 18,310 in 
public school enrolment and of 6,083 in average daily attendance, a very fair proportion 
of this advance being in attendance of colored pupils. More pupils studied the higher 
branches, more were supplied with free text books, more schools were taught, more 
were graded, the average school term was 4} days longer, and $154,130 more were 
expended on schools. There were 69 more school-houses built than in 1880, and 288 
more were owned by districts, the value of school property having increased by $21,788. 
Great benefit to the schools had resulted from the improvement of teachers in methods 
of instruction, due to their attendance on normal institutes, held by means of aid received 
from the Peabody fund. 
SOUTH ATLANTIC STATES —NORTH CAROLINA. 
An increase appears of 2,010 in the number of white youth 6 to 21, and of 6,738 in 
that of colored youth, with 3,830 more white and 11,280 more colored enrolled in pub- 
lic schools, the whole increased enrolment of both races being 15,110, against an increase 
of only 8,748 in youth of school age. There were $56,777 more expended during the 
year for public schools, but the State school fund decreased by $100,000. A want of 
uniformity in statistics for the two years in respect to average attendance and some other 
points renders of little value any comparison which might be instituted. The figures 
show a decrease in average attendance of 4,982 for both races, but a full report was not 
made for either of the two years. Much was done to improve the teaching force by a 
number of normal schools, more or less permanent in character, established by religious 
associations in other States. 
  SOUTH CAROLINA. 
The statistics show an increase of 120 white and a decrease of 734 colored pupils en- 
rolled in public schools, the average attendance of neither race being reported; 84 more 
public schools taught, at an added cost of $21,006, the average term for the State being 
3} days longer; 190 more school-houses and 91 more owned by districts, school property 
being valued at $84,272 more than the preceding year; a slight increase in the average 
monthly payment of teachers; and a decrease of 22 in the number of white teachers, with 
an increase of 100 in that of colored employed. The decrease in attendance of colored 
         
-P-A-G-E-73
PRESENT EDUCATIONAL CONDITION. LXXUI 
pupils was due in some cases to the unusually severe winter weather and in others to 
the use of school funds for the improvement and erection of school-houses, leaving little 
for tuition. The superintendent says there are evidences of progress which cannot be 
expressed in figures. Among them are mentioned the holding of two State normal 
institutes, one for white and one for colored teachers, which, besides their other good 
results, aroused a deeper popular interest in the schools. Educational questions, he says, 
are now more often discussed in the newspapers, in public meetings, and in general con- 
versation; there was increased efficiency in educational officers; the school fund was bet- 
ter administered; and popular prejudice against free public schools was diminishing. 
GEORGIA. 
With 461,016 youth 6 to 18 years of age in 1880, there were 244,197 pupils enrolled 
in public schools in 1881. There was an increase. of 3,022 in white pupils and of 4,642 
in colored, the whole increased enrolment being 7,664, with 4,718 more in average daily 
attendance. There were, however, 1,662 fewer pupils reported in elementary private 
schools, 1,211 fewer in academic and 2,245 fewer in collegiate institutions. The number 
of public schools increased by 139, and the money raised for their support by $27,504. 
FLORIDA. 
In the absence of statistics for 1880-’81, no comparison of the educational condition of 
that year with the preceding one can be made. Even the secretary and agent of the 
Peabody fund trustees, on whom the State has to depend for special aid towards the im- 
provement of its schools, has not been able to obtain statistics later than for 1879-’80. 
There was at that time a public school enrolment of 39,315 pupils out of 74,213 youth 
4 to 21 years of age—nearly 53 per cent. —with an average daily attendance of 27,046. 
GULF STATES —ALABAMA, 
The public schools received in 1880-’81 $9,466 more for their support than in the pre- 
vious year and had $35,225 more spent on them ; they also had a larger force of teachers 
at higher average pay ; yet the figures which indicate results are almost wholly on the 
losing side, enrolment having diminished by 3,201 (though the United States Census 
shows a much larger number of school age to draw from) and average daily attendance 
on school exercises declining by 2,662. In elementary studies, such as spelling, reading, 
and writing, there were from 1,782 to 13,476 fewer pupils, and only in the more popular 
ones of geography and arithmetic an increase; in the former, of 42; in the latter, of 
9,653. No explanation is presented in the State report of these temporarily disappoint- 
ing results in what certainly appears to be a much improved school system. 
MISSISSIPPI. 
In this State the results presented are greatly more encouraging. With $22,683 less 
raised for public schools and $72,947 less spent on them and with a smaller school pop- 
- ulation by 6,726.to draw from for filling them, there were yet 634 more pupils on the 
rolls, 9,680 more in average belonging, and 3,303 more in average daily attendance. 
Considering the low estate and poor condition of the great body of the colored people, the 
number of their children put into the schools and going to make up this large increase 
in attendance is very remarkable. 
LOUISIANA. 
With 16,191 more youth of age for public school instruction, with 195 more public schools 
to receive these, and with an increase of $29,626 in expenditure for support of the State 
schools, giving an average pay of $4 more a month for teachers, there were yet 6,070 
fewer pupils brought under instruction in the State system. Lack of such teachers as 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
LXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
longer terms of school and consequently better annual pay would bring into the service ; 
lack of good school-houses, with the needful appliances for comfort; and lack of efficient 
local supervision, which can only be obtained through more remunerative salaries than 
are now given to the few existing parish superintendents, are among the reasons indi- 
cated in the State report for this disappointing educational condition. 
TEXAS. 
The original returns for 1880-’81 having been consumed by a fire in the State office 
and duplicates of these having been in many cases unattainable, the statistics of only 
109 counties against 132 in the preceding year appear in the State report. Any fair 
comparison of year with year cannot, of course, be made in such circumstances. The 
figures, as presented, appear to indicate retrogression at every point; but the secretary 
of the State board of education, whose opportunities for knowledge of all the facts were 
of the best, declares that there was large increase in the number of the publicschools main- 
tained, and also of the pupils in them. He admits, however, that the system is defec- 
tive, and that there can be no approach to perfection in the working of it till there is 
more effective supervision, with better teachers, longer school terms, and permission to

Here we find an increase for the year of 27,772 pupils enrolled in the public schools, 
while only 25,294 more youth 6 to 21 were reported in the State; a corresponding increase 
in teachers and school-houses, school property valued at $84,517 more ; and $150,356 
more applied to public school purposes. 
KANSAS, 
  The statistics from this State show progress at almost all points. With an increased 
enumeration of 7,532 youth 5 to 21, there were 17,600 more pupils enrolled in public 
schools and 2,109 more in daily average attendance. More school districts reported and 
more had uniform text books; public school-houses increased in number and school prop- 
erty in value; the average term was 10 days longer and the public school expenditure 
was $158,010 more. The average monthly pay of teachers, however, decreased by $2.26 
for men and $2.21 for women. 
    ‘MISSOURI. 
Missouri reports 741,632 youth 6 to 20 years of age and 488,091, or nearly 66 per cent., 
enrolled in public schools, an increase for the year of 11,715 in the number enrolled. 
There were 172 more schools for whites taught and 9 more for colored; 17,807 more 
sittings were provided, the value of school property increasing by $168,294 and the whole 
amount expended for school purposes by $316,561. 
KENTUCKY, 
With 483,404 white youth 6 to 20 years of age in the State there were 238,440, or not 
quite 50 per cent., enrolled in public schools,.and only 149,226 in average daily attend- 
ance, a decrease of 6,918 enrolled and 8,992 in average attendance, with an increase of 
4,807 in youth of school age. The colored school population (6 to 16) numbered 70,234, 
but the enrolment of these is not reported. Fifty-three more districts sustained schools 
for white and 21 more schools for colored children; 29 more school-houses for whites were 
reported, the value of their school property increasing by $166,697 and the whole expendi- 
ture for public schools by $381,124. 
‘TENNESSER. 
The statistics here show 545,875 youth 6 to 21, 283,468 enrolled in public schools, and 
180,509 in average daily attendance, an increase for the year of 1,013 in school popula-

tion, with a decrease of 6,673 in public school enrolment and of 10,952 in average daily 
attendance. The number of pupils attending private schools also decreased, leaving 
12,687 fewer pupils in both classes of schools. An increase of 6,915 appears in the 
number of colored youth enrolled in public schools, but even with this there was not 
quite 49, per cent. of the school population in attendance. The decrease of 13,588 white 
pupils enrolled left about 53 per cent. in the schools. More public schools were taught, 
also more private and more consolidated schools (the last being a union of the first two); 
the average public school term was 2 days longer, but the whole expenditure was 
$86,853 less, although 926 more teachers were employed and their average pay was only 
7 cents a month less. The number of school-houses was 2 more than the previous year, 
but the estimated value of school property was $198,282 1 although considerable 
improvement is reported in school-houses, more than 500 old structures giving place to 
new ones and many being supplied with better furniture. Such inconsistent statistics 
are doubtless the result of imperfect reports, 3 counties having failed to report at all 
in 1880, and 6 in 1881. Possibly, too, some of the serious retrogression above noted 
may be due to the same cause, since encouraging reports are given of the condition of 
the schools by the State superintendent and the popular sentiment regarding them is 
said to be improving. 
    WEST VIRGINIA. 
The report from this State shows encouraging educational progress: improvement in 
methods of instruction; a demand for better teachers; an increased interest of parents in 
the schools; improved school buildings, with better furniture and apparatus; an increased. 
number of county educational meetings held ; and provision made by the legislature for 
the free education of 18 colored normal students at Storer College, Harper’s Ferry. 
‘There was an increase of 2,353 pupils enrolled in public schools against 3,078 more 
youth 6 to 21. The increased enrolment of white pupils was nearly equal to the increase 
in white school population; but the enrolment of colored pupils fell off, while the num- 
ber of school age increased. Indeed, not quite 48 per cent. of the colored youth of 
school age attended public schools for any part of the year; and the per cent. of whites 
attending was only 69.. The decrease in average daily attendance was not large, and 
was about the same for both races, though proportionately much greater for the colored. 
More public schools were taught and $44,386 more were expended for school purposes, but 
the average pay of teachers decreased and the average term of schools was 9 days shorter. 
More school buildings were reported and the valuation of school property was $82,609 
greater. 
NORTHERN CENTRAL STATES — OHIO, 
Ohio reports 1,063,337 youth 6 to 21 years of age, 744,758 enrolled in public schools, 
and 468,141 in average daily attendance, with 30,362 in private schools, or nearly 73 
per cent. of the school population under instruction during some portion of the year. 
The statistics show an increase during the year of 17,112 in school population, with a 
decrease of 2,380 enrolled in public schools and an increase of 1,712 in private schools, 
leaving a small decrease in the number of pupils under instruction in both classes of 
schools, with a largely increased number to be educated. There was also a decrease of 
8,138 in the average daily attendance on public schools. But it must be remembered, 
in dealing with the statistics of this State, that for some time past each alternate year 
has been one of depression, The public school enrolment increased largely during 
1875-76, 1877-78, and 1879~’80, falling off in every intervening year. Comparing the 
statistics of 1879 and 1881, we find, indeed, about 20,000 more youth to be educated in 
1881, with only 10,000 more enrolled in public schools and 8,000 more in average daily 
attendance, but the per cent. of attendance on enrolment, counting public and private 
school pupils, was about the same. It appears, too, that, notwithstanding the decrease 
reported for 1881 in publicschool enrolment and average attendance, there were 92 more

school-houses, having 134 more rooms occupied, school property increasing $252,264 in 
value; 286 more teachers were employed, though at reduced pay; $429,173 more were 
expended for school purposes, and the average term was 5 days longer. 
INDIANA. 
Although the annual enumeration showed 10,785 more youth to be instructed in 
1880-81 and although 217 more districts reported schools for such instruction as having 
been taught in that year, the fine record of the previous year was not maintained. 
Enrolment in the public schools fell off by 7,428 and ave daily attendance on them 
by 15,358. Even with this falling off the enrolment was about 70.5 per cent. of the 
youth of school age and the average attendance about 60.7 per cent. of the number en- 
rolled, which would be thought in most States very fair. The private schools in public 
buildings, which are here allowed by the school law in the intervals of public sessions, 
were 101 more and enrolled 1,702 more pupils, bringing up a little higher the percentage 
of all under instruction; while graded schools, with their superior training, though less 
numerous by 22 in districts’, were more so by 125 in townships, giving an absolute in- 
crease of 103, making the general average of the public teaching better. The new 
school-houses, with their greater comforts and advantages, were also 56 more than in the 
previous year, school property thus rating $206,225 higher. Receipts and expenditures 
for public schools showed an increase of $77,456 in the former and of $36,904 in the 
latter. 
       
  ILLINOIS, 
In this State, as in Indiana, the year’s record was a fair one, but inferior to that of 
the preceding year. Instead of a public school enrolment that included more than the 
whole increase in youth of school age and an additional average attendance more than 
double this large increase of enrolment, there was a decline of 2,414 in one and of 5,780 
in the other, attendance on private and church schools also diminishing. Still, here also 
the enrolment, thus diminished, took in 70 per cent. of the school youth of the State 
(75.9 per cent., if private and church schools are included), and the average attendance 
‘was about 60.7 per cent. of the enrolment. The public schools, too, gained on the pri- 
vate, the latter reported being 34 less, the graded schools in the public system 30 
more, with 42 more houses for public schools and an increase of $1,080,744 in school 
property as valued. Then receipts for public schools were greater, expenditures for them 
$326,472 more, and the average pay of teachers of both sexes considerably better than 
for two preceding years. 
MICHIGAN. 
Michigan, with more than 518,000 youth of school age (5 to 20), had 371,743 attending 
public and1 9,788 attending private schools, or over 71 per cent. of the school population 
enrolled in public schools and over 75 per cent. in both classes, an increase for the year 
of 12,073 in school population and of 9,187 in public school enrolment, with 934 more 
in private schools. There were 175 more public school-houses, with 8,595 more sittings, 
school property being valued at $406,857 more, and 17,891 more volumes were reported. 
in public school libraries. There was an increase in the number of teachers employed 
and in the number attending State institutes. The permanent school fund was $159,241 
more and $307,683 more were expended on public schools, although the average pay of 
teachers decreased slightly; the average term of schools was 4 days longer. 
WISCONSIN, 
Wisconsin reports over 300,000 pupils in public and 26,252 in private schools out of 
491,358 youth 4 to 20 years of age. Counting 4,724 who attended State normal schools 
and academies gives us over 67 per cent. of the school population attending. There 
were also 2,971 students in collegiate and theological schools (an increase for the year of
-P-A-G-E-77

884), besides 1,938 under instruction in benevolent institutions. Comparing these sta- 
tistics with those of the previous year we find 8,129 more youth of school age, but only 
665 more enrolled in public schools, while the average daily attendance decreased by 
6,632. There were more pupils in private schools, however, by 314. There were fewer 
public schools taught by 141, but more of these were graded and high, and the average 
term was over 13 days longer; the expenditure for public schools was $48,331 more; the 
amount of public school fund increased by $42,370, and the normal school fund by $27,793, 
while there were smaller advances in the university and agricultural college funds. The 
superintendent finds in the above, and in other facts, evidence of a steady and healthful ad- 
vancement. He reports greater harmony and zeal in the management and teaching of the 
schools; more apparént willingness to remedy defects in the system ; a slight growth of 
sentiment favorable to the employment of better teachers for longer terms; a wider dis- 
semination of information in respect to hygienic laws in their application to school- 
houses, grounds, and the care of children while in school; and a marked progress in 
methods of instruction in the country schools, through the adoption of a graded course 
of study. 
MINNESOTA. 
Owing to the death of State Superintendent Burt before completing his report for 
1880-’81, full statistics for that year cannot be obtained. The return sent by his suc- 
cessor shows a decrease of 2,970 in public school pupils enrolled and of $239,622 ex- 
pended for them, but an increase of 6 days in the average school term, of 356 in the num- 
ber of teachers (who received a slight advance in pay),of $559,559 in the estimated value 
of public school property, and of $385,748 in the State school fund. 
Towa. 
With 594,730 youth 5 to 21 years of age, there were 431,513, or over 72 per cent., en- 
rolled in public schools and more than 15,000 attending private schools, which raised 
the percentage of pupils under instruction to 75. There was an increase for the year 
of 8,174 in youth of school age, which was nearly met by an increased enrolment of 5,456 
in public and of 2,374 in private schools, but the average attendance on public schools 
decreased by 5,748. More school-houses were reported, at an increased valuation of 
$290,250; more teachers were employed, their average monthly pay was slightly ad- 
vanced, and the permanent school fund was increased by $62,713. 
NEBRASKA, 
Here the public schools enrolled 100,776 out of 152,824 youth 5 to 21, or about 66 
per cent., but only 65,504 were in average daily attendance. The number of pupils in 
private or church schools was not reported. A comparison of these figures with those 
of the previous year shows an advance in nearly all respects. There were 10,476 more 
youth of school age, 8,227 more enrolled in public schools, and 5,348 more in average 
daily attendance. With an increase of 269 in school districts there were 517 more having 
school 6 months and over, while fewer reported no schools and the average term for the 
State was a day longer. More teachers were employed, at a slight advance in average 
pay; $27,108 more were expended for public school purposes and the permanent State 
school fund increased by $1,803,348. 
COLORADO. 
In this State, out of 40,804 youth 6 to 21 years of age, 26,000, or 63 per cent., were 
enrolled in public schools, 14,649 being in average daily attendance. The number attend- 
ing private and church schools was not reported. An advance for the year appears of 
3,881 in pupils enrolled and of 2,031 in average daily attendance, with 5,238 more of

school age, which was met by an addition of 5,977 sittings for pupils in 22 school build- 
ings, 112 more teachers, and $161,624 more expended on the schools. There were 1,395 
more volumes in the school libraries, the valuation of school property was $294,803 more, 
and the average monthly pay of teachers in ungraded schools advanced considerably, 
men receiving $10.84 and women $6.56 more, while men teaching graded schools were 
paid $1.58 more, but women $1.52 less. 
STATES ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE—NEVADA, 
The decay of mining interests still shows its effect on the population and the schools, 
22 fewer districts/‘making report of schools and the number reported being 29 below that 
reported in 1879-’80, the reported value of school property going down also $15,081; 
teachers 21 fewer, with smaller salaries ; youth of school age reported, 59 less; the aver- 
age length of term was 2.4 days less ; enrolment in public schools 716 less, with a corre- 
sponding diminution in the private schools. Yet, with all this falling off, the average 
attendance in public schools increased a little ; 20 more schools were sustained without 
rate bills; receipts for public schools were $4,079 greater, and the growth of the State 
school fund was $149,000.   
  CALIFORNIA. 
In this State there are clear signs of educational advance in the State school system, 
as is learned from the report of the superintendent, received since the abstract (page 13) 
was prepared. Although the census takers reported 4,741 fewer youth of age for free 
instruction, 985 more of that age were brought into the public schools, while, including 
those under and over the school age, 5,090 more pupils were enrolled. In average daily 
attendance, too, 4,575 more were reported. Per contra, youth in private schools fell off 
1,055. To meet the considerable additional number of public school pupils there were 
149 more public schools, 46 more of the districts reporting good school accommodations 
and 30 more good furniture. Of the 142 more teachers, also, 95 were graduates of normal 
schools. Enrolment, average belonging, average attendance, all were largely in excess 
of like items in any former year, while the per cent. of non-attendance was less than for 
seven preceding years. 
OREGON, 
School districts were more numerous by 30 and 28 more reported their statistics. 
These showed the existence of 87 more school-houses, adding $89,606 to the value of 
school property; showed a school population of 2,026 more to be instructed; showed funds 
for such instruction $20,139 greater; showed that 12 more first grade certificates had 
been issued to teachers and 80 more second grade; but yet showed also that 3,035 
fewer pupils were enrolled in the public schools and that 2,239 fewer had been in aver- 
age daily attendance ; this, too, though private schools, which increased by 44, had 
gathered in 612 additional pupils. The only gain exhibited in attendance on the public 
system was in the districts with graded ‘schools, and as these are almost wholly in the 
towns and cities the considerable decrease indicated must have been in the comparatively 
poor and unattractive country schools. 
‘THE TERRITORIES—ALASKA, 
The accounts show increase of educational facilities, of school attendance, and of im- 
provement from these in this yet unorganized vast territory. New buildings for schools 
and teachers were erected among the Chilkats, Hoonyahs, and Hydahs at large expense 
and with great labor, owing to the immense distances of these tribes from each other and 
from the sources of supply. Attendance appears to have increased from about 250 to 
nearly 500, with an average of at least half this, while in one instance a school of much 
promise was formed substantially by a set of Indian boys, who voluntarily withdrew 
from the degradation of bad native homes to secure themselves an education, even at 
 
-P-A-G-E-79

the expense of daily labor for their own support while getting it. All this is from a 
report of the active Presbyterian agent in the field ; the Methodists, who are said to be 
entering it, not having yet sent any report of work, and none having come from the 
Alaska Company’s schools on the Seal Islands. 
ARIZONA, 
Although the report of the territorial superintendent indicates that the school returns 
here are incomplete, falling far short of showing the actual educational condition, it is 
evident from even these returns that public schools had increased in number, 148 being 
reported against 101 ‘‘rooms for study’’ reported in 1879-’80, while school property 
was rated $8,244 higher. Receipts and expenditures for schools, however, were less by 
several thousand dollars, as presented, and the enrolment reported was 368 less than that 
of the preceding year, perhaps because there were 9 private or church schools, not pre- 
viously reported, working as rivals of the public schools. 
DAKOTA. 
  Reports from this great Territory are defective, from the fact that important towns and 
cities have charters which release them from obligation to make returns of school affairs 
and from the further fact that county officers too often do not make them. Still, from 
the United States Census of 1880 and from reports of the territorial authorities for the 
latter part of 1881, it may be seen that there was in the latter year an’increase of prob- 
ably at least 11,000 youth of school age, an enrolment in the public schools of so many 
additional pupils as to more than cover this large increase, a provision of over 500 
more schools for those enrolled, with a corresponding addition to the teaching force, while 
the receipts for schools, by the reported figures, exceeded by $108,000 the highest estimate 
of those of 1880, and, in the opinion of the superintendent of instruction, exceeded 
them by about a quarter of a million. : 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA! 
Of the school population shown here by the United States Census of 1880 there were 
62.7 per cent. enrolled in public schools in 1880-’81, and, of those enrolled, 75.9 per 
cent. were in average daily attendance, the colored pupils especially distinguishing 
themselves in respect to this attendance. Receipts for all school purposes were $78,687 
greater than in the previous year and expenditures $88,745 greater ; school property, 
through the addition of new buildings and repair of old ones, rose in value $120,533. 
There was an increase of 27 teachers, and every new teacher appointed in the primary 
grades has received normal training. 
IDAHO, 
The most important county here not reporting its educational statistics and those from. 
some other counties being too uncertain to form a basis for definite conclusions, it is diffi- 
1Phere is a natural desire in the District of Columbia and abroad in the country that education 
of the people at the capital of the nation should be in all respects a model for the study of the rest 
of the country and for the observation of foreigners. Great advances have been made in the last 
fifteen years, but much remains to be accomplished. The system should be complete; certainly a 
school for the reform of girls and special schools to give instruction in various industries and 
school-houses embodying the best results of pedagogical study and sufficient to accommodate all the 
children should be erected. No one can observe the large number of wayward or neglected chil- 
dren in the streets without acknowledging the necessity of providing for their care and instruction, 
and perhaps ample authority may be found in an old act passed by the city government providing 
for the binding out of poor orphan children and the children of drunkards, vagrants, and paupers, 
passed October 31, 1820. The child or children of drunkards, vagrants, or paupers who appear to 
be bringing up their children in ignorance and vice, sloth, and idleness, or who suffer them to be 
begging or holding horses for hire at public places, may be taken in charge by the trustee or justice 
of the peace, and, if a male child, may be bound out until he shall have arrived at the age of 21 
years, and, if a female, till she shall have arrived at the age of 16 years,

cult to determine whether there was in 1880-81 an educational advance or not. The 
territorial superintendent, however, thinks there has been ‘‘substantial progress.”’ 
INDIAN TERRITORY. 
Under this head all education of the Indians, except in Alaska, has been included. 
Among the 5 great tribes in the Indian Territory proper, the reports respecting youth of 
school age were defective ; among other tribes throughout the United States, there was 
an increase of 4,382 in such youth. Still, in the former there were 85 more presented as 
under instruction against 869 more among the latter; while average attendance on the 
schools taught appears from the figures to have been wonderfully good for children and 
youth in such unfavorable circumstances. The training of selected Indian youth, with 
the consent of their parents, away from the hindering influences of savage life and amidst 
the surroundings of civilization, continued through the year with such encouraging suc- 
cess as to draw forth from high authorities strong words of commendation and to lead to 
a resolution to extend the system. 
MONTANA, 
With about 10,000 youth of school age here, there were 5,112 pupils reported in the 
territorial public schools and 2,800 in average attendance. For a Territory of immense 
extent and with a population greatly scattered this is a fair showing, quite up to that of 
several States long and well settled and beyond that of some States. Within the two 
years presented there was considerable advance in youth to be educated, in attendance 
upon schools, in teachers employed, and in their qualifications. 
  NEW MEXICO. 
In the absence of territorial reports on education the United States Census of 1880 
affords the latest information. This shows that with 29,255 youth of school age (7-18) 
there were 4,755 under instruction in the nominally public schools and 3,150 in average 
daily attendance. If these figures look discouraging, they yet indicate a far better state 
of things than in 1870, when, with an approximate number of children of school age, 
only 1,798 were reported as in school. In a population separated from the prosperous 
States and scattered thinly over a vast area, wherethe older residents are averse to unsec- 
tarian public schools and Spanish and Indian languages largely prevail, the schools have 
not prospered; but, as important railroads are pushing through the Territory and bring- 
ing in a better people eager for all advantages, another census must show figures very 
different from those above. 
UTAH, 
With 42,353 youth 6 to 18, the Territory of Utah reports 26,772 attending public 
schools. Public school enrolment increased 2,446 during the year and average daily at- 
tendance 1,504, the increase in school population being only 1,681. More schools were 
taught and more teachers employed; the average public school term was 12 days longer; 
and $67,070 more were expended on public schools. Improvement in the qualifications 
of teachers and in the style and quality of school-houses is also reported. 
WASHINGTON TERRITORY. © 
This Territory reports 23,899 youth 4 to 21 years of age; 14,754, or a little over 60 per 
cent., enrolled in public schools; and 11,275 in average daily attendance. There were 
729 more pupils in average attendance than the year before, with a slight decrease 
in the number enrolled and 2,750 fewer of school age. Fewerpublic school-houses were 
reported and fewer teachers, but there was an increase in the average pay of teachers 
and in the amount of public school income.

  It appears from the report of the governor to the legislature that public schools con- 
tinued to prosper and new ones were opened, liberal sums were expended in building 
and repairing school-houses, and efforts were made to secure better teachers. The 
statistics show an enrolment of 2,544 pupils in public schools, a decrease for the year

a In Delaware, in addition to the school tax collected from colored citizens, which has heretofore 
been the only State appropriation for the support of colored schools, the legislature now appropriates 
annually 2,400 from the State treasury for educating the colored children of the State; in Kentucky, 
in 1881, the school tax collected from colored citizens was the only money coming from the State 
for the support of their schools—there was, however, in this year a growth in the movement to 
give to colored children of school age equal advantages with the white children in the common 
school fund of the State; in Maryland there is a biennial appropriation ; in the District of Columbia 
one-third of the school funds is set apart for colored public schools; in South Carolina the school 
moneys are distributed in proportion to the average attendance without regard to race; and in the 
other States mentioned above the school moneys are divided in proportion to the school population 
without regard to race.

CONDITION OF EDUCATION AT THE SOUTH. LXXXVII 
The school population of the sixteen States and the District of Columbia comprised in 
the table on page 1xxxi showsan increase over that reported in 1880 of 180,569, distributed 
as follows: White, 54,639, or an increase of 1.4 per cent.; colored, 125,930, or an in- 
crease of 6.9 per cent. The enrolment as compared with that of 1880 shows a total in- 
crease of 36,866, viz: White, 19,203, ora little above eight-tenths of 1 per cent.; colored, 
17,663, or 2+ percent. While this gain in colored enrolment indicates a growing interest 
in the education of the colored people throughout the South and a more vigorous conduct 
of their school affairs, further examination of the facts reveals @gomewhat discouraging 
view of their school status. 
In the States under consideration, with the exception of Delaware, Kentucky, and 
Maryland, the school funds are distributed without distinction of race; nevertheless the 
percentage of enrolment is much higher for the white than for the colored population in 
‘all but three of the States. 3 
In accounting for this disproportion the prejudices that formerly hindered the col- 
ored race in the use of their school privileges must be considered and the excess of the 
white above the colored population in the majority of southern cities, enrolment being 
always higher in the cities than in the rural districts. The chief causes, however, of 
the low percentage of enrolment for the colored race are the meagreness of the school 
fands and the extreme poverty of the colored people. The first condition affects the 
whole population, but the white people are able to avert its worst consequences. 
They supplement their portion of the school fund in various ways, and they are in pos- 
session of much school property that was accumulated before the war. The colored 
people, on the contrary, can contribute very little for school purposes; they have few 
school-houses and no funds for building. In many sections it is difficult to secure teach- 
ers for the colored schools, and in sparsely settled districts‘almost impossible to collect 
enough children at one centre to form a school. More school-houses and provision for 
the conveyance of pupils where population is most scattering are urgently required. In 
view of the low intellectual and moral status of the colored people, their relation to our 
prosperity and to our civil institutions, and the responsibility which we must admit 
with reference to them, it is important that the means available for their improvement 
should be fully comprehended. In considering the school funds it is not possible to dis- 
tinguish between the two races, nor need this be done; it is only necessary to bear in 
mind that wherever the resources are meagre the colored people are the worst sufferers. 
The expenditure for schools in the section represented in the table was $13,359,784, 
about one-sixth of the total expenditure for all the States and Territories; while the 
school population of the specified section is very nearly one-fourth of the total school popu- 
lation. It has been asserted that the Southern States do not make such provision for the 
schools as they might, and unfavorable comparison is drawn between them and northern 
communities in this respect. It must, however, be remembered that whatever be the 
potential resources of the Southern States they have much less available wealth than 
other sections of the country, a fact which meets us at every examination of school 
finances. 
By reference to Table I, Part 2, appendix, p. 325, the amount of school income derived 
from taxation in the several States will be seen, and, by reference to the abstracts of 
State reports in the appendix, the rates of taxation may be ascertained. For a full 
understanding of the conditions it would be necessary to compare these data with the 
amount of taxable property in each State. Without going into all the details, it may be 
said in general, from the showing of the census of 1880, that the valuation of real estate 
and personal property in the recent slave States and the District of Columbia is less than 
one-fifth the total valuation for all the States and Territories, while the population in 
the same is more than one-third of the total population. A few specific statements may 
be added for emphasis. The valuation of personal property and real estate in the section 
under consideration is $3,560,380,175 for a population of 18,684,948; the valuation of 
personal property and real estate in the three States of New York, New Jersey, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  
  LXXXVHI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Pennsylvania is $4,907,917,383 for a population of 10,496,878. Connecticut, with a 
State school tax not exceeding $1.50 per capita of school population and a local tax 
whose limit is 10 cents on $100, raises $1,276,667 for school purposes. The State school 
tax of Alabama consists of all the polls levied at $1.50 each and a local tax whose limit 
is 10 cents on $100; the amount realized from both is $250,000. From a State school 
tax of 10 cents on $100 and a local tax whose limit is 25 cents on $100, Nebraska 
realizes $786,963. South Carolina, from the polls levied at $1 each and a local tax not 
to exceed 20 cents on ee, realizes $441,110. Figures taken from a few States cannot 
be conclusive, but they serve to indicate the sort of examination which should precede 
positive statements of the comparative ability of the States to support their school 
systems. 
Without doubt popular education has to contend against greater apathy and ignorance 
in the Southern than in the Northern States; the tax levied is not so readily collected 
in the South; a local school tax is not always allowed, and where it is allowed is seldom 
kept up to the limit; but, on the other hand, the common school cause finds in the 
Southern States some of its most intelligent and earnest advocates. These men have 
already done much to increase local taxation and to secure the prompt collection and 
honest use of the tax levied, and they have beenas faithful in rousing their own peo- 
ple to exertion as they have been earnest in pressing the educational wants of their see- 
tion upon the attention of Congress. The spirit and method which they bring to the 
work are illustrated in the measures taken by Hon, G. J. Orr, State school commissioner 
of Georgia, to induce legislation in the interests of the school system of his State. Mr. 
Orr urges an annual tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent. on the taxable property of the State 
for the support of common schools, together with the remaining half rental of the 
Western and Atlantic Railroad, the former amounting to upwards of $250,000, the lat- 
ter to $150,000. For the purpose of adequately bringing the facts bearing upon the 
propositions to the attention of the legislature, Mr. Orrmade an exhaustive calculation by 
counties of the sources and amounts of school revenue under the present conditions and 
as they would be affected by the proposed legislation. As the estimates were made for 
the year 1881, the totals may properly be introduced here: 
Amount of the State school commissioner’s order on tax collection __ $272, 574 91 
        
        Amount of poll tax paid county school commissioners. 172, 450 20 
Sum total of foregoing, constituting entire present school fund _ 445, 025 11 
Present fund increased by tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent 700, 119 09 
Present fund increased by remaining half rental of Western and ‘Atlantic 
Railroad ~~ - 595, 025 11 
Present fund increased by 850, 119 09 
  The amount per capita of average attendance realized from the present fund ranges 
from $1.68 to $4.94. With the proposed additions the per capita would range from 
$2.50 to $14.66. The present funds are sufficient to maintain the schools upon an av- 
erage 2.7-+- months. With the increase the schools could be maintained upon an average 
4.7+- months. According to the census of 1880 Georgia ranks sixth among the recent 
slave States in real estate and personal property. The legislation urged by Mr. Orr 
would secure, it seems, the largest revenue for school purposes compatible with the 
financial condition of the State. The relative position which it would give Georgia 
among the States may be seen by comparing Mr. Orr’s estimates with the data presented 
in Table I, Part 1, Summary A, and Table I, Part 2, Summaries A and B. 
From a careful examination of the reports and statements of officers and teachers 
engaged in school work in the Southern States, as well as from personal observation of the 
same for several successive years, I am aware that marked progress has been made in the 
education of the masses in these States. The free school system is better understood 
and appreciated by the people and the schools as a rule are more efficient than at any 
previous time. There are exceptions to this general condition. In some cities there 
is even open or secret opposition to the schools, and in some rural districts depressing
-P-A-G-E-89
CONDITION OF EDUCATION AT THE SOUTH. LXXXIX 
apathy; the best argument that can be brought to bear upon these adverse influences 
is the practical one of good schools maintained in the face of hostility or indifference. 
This is the position assumed by those who so earnestly advocate national aid for common 
schools, to be distributed upon the basis of illiteracy. Illiteracy is more extensive in the 
South than in other sections of the country, and develops peculiarly alarming tendencies 
among the colored people. It would be impossible to repeat here all the facts and 
arguments called forth by the recent discussion of this subject; they do not present a 
more serious view of the situation than was embodied by the late Dr. Barnas Sears in his 
last reportas agent of the Peabody fund. Dr. Sears, it must be remembered, had twelve 
years’ personal knowledge of the southern field, and was not inclined, either by temper- 
ament or experience or years, to sensational representations. 
“With two millions of children,’’ he said, ‘‘ in these States still without the means of 
instruction, it becomes good citizens not to slumber over the danger of their situation. 
The mere neglect of a great opportunity may entail disaster upon them and their pos- 
terity, by suffering a horde of young barbarians to grow up to prey upon the peace of 
society. The peril, if once overlooked in the critical moment, cannot afterwards be reme- 
died by legal enactments and penal measures. Ifmen fail to take the necessary precaution. 
by training the young to be useful citizens, they must expect to reap a corresponding har- 
vest, and see around them a community distinguished for ‘dwarfish virtues and gigantic 
vices.’’? The opinion expressed by Dr. Sears is confirmed by the memorial of the trustees 
of the Peabody fund to Congress, by his successor, Dr. Curry, and by the agents of the 
several religious denominations that have contributed so freely to the cause of southern 
education. 
Realizing the inadequacy of the means at command to overcome the ignorance and 
degradation of the masses of the freedmen as rapidly as the interests of society and 
good government require, the representatives of these various philanthropic agencies 
unite in the appeal for national aid to education. It is worthy of note that the Senate 
of the United States has recorded itself in favor of the measure. 
Onthe 17th of December, 1880, that body passed the billentitled ‘‘An act to establish 
an educational fund, and apply a portion of the proceeds of the public lands to public 
education, and to provide for the more complete endowment and support of colleges for 
the advancement of scientific and industrial education.”? It was not proposed to con- 
fine the benefits of the act to the Southern States, but the provision that it embodied for 
distributing the income of the fund during the first ten years on the basis of illiteracy 
would have secured to them temporarily the special assistance which they need. It wil} 
be remembered that in 1872 the House of Representatives passed asimilar bill; it seems 
hardly possible that a measure which is supported by the most enlightened and patriotic 
citizens and which has been approved by the separate action of both houses of Congress 
can long fail of success. 
The total number of institutions represented in the table on page Ixxxvi is 17,375, 
having an enrolment of 818,365. It will be seen that 31 of the 47 normal schools, 31 of 
the 34 institutions for secondary instruction, the universities and colleges (17), and the 
schools of theology (22) derive their support from religious denominations. The schools 
of law (3) and of medicine (2) are supported chiefly by tuition fees.

    In accordance with the policy adopted in 1879, the disbursements from the Peabody 
fund, amounting to $50,375 for 1881, have been applied chiefly to normal schools, normal 
institutes, and other agencies for the training of teachers. The details of the year’s 
work are given under the head of Aid from the Peabody Fund, under the respective States, 
in the abstracts of the appendix. 
Peculiar interest attaches to the final action with Sree to the normal college at 
Nashville. It will be remembered that, from the want of codperation on the part of the 
State of Tennessee, the trustees of the Peabody fund were obliged to consider the prop- 
osition for the removal of the college to Atlanta, Ga. The matter seemed to the agent, 
the late Dr. Barnas Sears, one of supreme importance, and its settlement engaged his 
efforts almost to the moment of his death. He had the satisfaction of believing that his 
endeavors had been-successful and that the chief burden of the support of the college 
would not hereafter fall on the Peabody fund. The negotiation has been continued 
from the point to which Dr. Sears carried it by his successor, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, with 
the result of an annual appropriation of $6,000 from the State of Tennessee for the coi- 
lege. Dr. Curry is confident that the State will henceforth deal liberally with the college.

PEABODY» FUND. XCI 
Like his predecessor, Dr. Curry devotes himself to personal examination of the section 
in which the Peabody fund is disbursed, studying the wants and promise of the work, 
rousing public interest by his addresses, and securing the codperation of prominent men 
by correspondence and conference. His efforts with the State legislatures in behalf of 
education have been specially fruitful in results. 
A great work has been done during the year in the direction of normal institutes, which, 
pending the establishment of normal schools, are the chief agency for training the teach- 
ers of the common schools in the Southern States. In this connection Dr. Curry says: 
These institutes have been valuable in stimulating and sustaining popular interest in 
education, in awakening teachers to a higher appreciation of the teacher’s work, and in 
correcting some stereotyped prejudices in reference to the art of teaching. This year 
institutes, aided or sustained by the fund, have been held in all but three of the States, 
and with signal success. Every year makes an improvement in organization, manage- 
ment, and instruction. The aid given by the trustees has produced immediate results 
and elicited warmest expressions of gratitude. 
Normal schools, as having continuous life and influence and coming more literally 
within the purview of the instruction of the trustees, have had much thought and labor. 
Permanent arrangements are needed to train the multitude of teachers which our school 
systemsdemand. The short lived institutes are not attended by all or by the most incom- 
petent, and cannot give thorough professional discipline and training. Notafew summer 
months, but toilsome years, are indispensable to teacher training. The establishment 
of normal schools for white and colored teachers has been earnestly advised, and aid has 
been promised to States which may establish them, so as to insure permanency and effi- 
ciency. In nearly all the States where normal schools do not exist, the superintend- 
ents are urging the subject upon their respective legislatures with zeal and ability. Iam 
persuaded that in my next report I shall be able to make a most satisfactory statement 
to the trustees in this behalf. 
It will be remembered that the Peabody trustees have authorized a system of scholar- 
ships which enables a certain number of normal students from each of the Southern States 
to enjoy the advantages of the normal college at Nashville. From February 1 to Octo- 
ber 1, 1881, the disbursements from the Peabody fund for normal schools and teachers’ 
institutes were as follows:

                Total_ 
This leaves a balance of $6,750, of which $500 went to Claflin University, $500 to 
Atlanta University, and the remainder was divided between elementary schools and 
educational journals. 
As during the last year, a judicious use was made of the Peabody medals in stimulat- 
ing the pupils of public schools.

Table II presents the statistics of 251 cities, as against 244 in 1880. Their school pop- 
ulation is above 17 per cent. of the whole school population of the country, enrolment 
above 17 per cent. of the total enrolment, and average daily attendance, exclusive of pri- 
vate schools, 26 per cent. of that reported for the entire country. The relative impor- 
tance of the school interests of these cities is more plainly indicated by the financial 
statistics. Their annual school income is about 33 per cent. of that reported for the 
whole country, the expenditure 32 per cent. of the total expenditure, and the value of 
school property 49 per cent. of the total valuation.

cvul REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF: EDUCATION. 
The school system is well organized in the majority of the cities and upon essentially 
the same plan. The general management is in charge of a board of education; the prac- 
tical administration is intrusted to a superintendent, who is asalaried officer. Since the 
creation of this office and its general adoption the schools of the different cities have 
been brought into remarkable agreement as respects gradation, courses of study, and 
standards and methods of examination; instruction has greatly improved ; and school 
funds have been used with more economy and better returns for the outlay. The fol- 
lowing are the chief matters now demanding attention : (1) The increase of school accom- 
modation; (2) the control of truants and absentees; (3) adaptation of studies and 
methods; (4) the conditions affecting the health of pupils, viz, the construction and 
sanitary arrangement of school buildings, physical training, and amount and continuity of 
intellectual effort. 
SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION. 
A careful study of Table II, appendix, will show that in a large proportion of the cities, 
especially in the Northern States, school accommodation is kept well up to the demand. 
Deficiency in this respect in southern cities arises from lack of funds and from the 
fact that the establishment of public schools is so recent. Where such deficiency exists 
in the northern cities it is due to the rapid increase of population and is complicated 
with the problems of immigration, pauperism, and the labor of children. 
Hon. Stephen A. Walker, president of the board of education of New York City, reports 
9,189 children turned away during the year from lack of accommodation. No definite 
statements of this kind have been received from other cities, but New York is not alone 
in the experience. Chicago has established ‘‘double divisions” to meet the pressure, 
and reports 6,668 half time pupils for the current year. Other cities have adopted the 
same expedient. The following statistics show the status of four of the largest cities of 
the United States with reference to elementary school provision:

It will be seen that Boston is the only one of the four in which the number of sittings 
is very nearly equal to the school population. The school age in this city includes only 
the ordinary period of school attendance, viz, 5-15 years; 2,294 pupils above 15 years of 
age are reported in attendance and§j42 below 5 years of age, or a total of 2,336, which 
would make very little difference I the estimates. The ratio of school population in 
Boston to total population is 168 to1,000. Estimated by this ratio the school population 
of the other cities under consideration would be as follows: New York, 202,643; Brook- 
lyn, 95,199; and Chicago, 84,535. By comparing these figures with the respective number 
of sittings it appears that for the accommodation of the estimated number of children New 
York would require 52,159 additional sittings; Brooklyn, 33,291; Chicago,34,232; whereas 
the sittings in Boston are only 4,879 less than the school population. Again, Boston is 
the only one of the four citiesin which the enrolmentisless than the accommodation, while

at the same time the attendance upon private schools is very small. In other words, the 
problem of school accommodation appears to have beensolved by the publicschools of that 
city. Theschool committee report 40 per cent. of school childen in the primary schools, a 
number about equal to the total of children from 5 to 8 years of ageinclusive, which is the 
ordinary period of primary school attendance. They report 54 per cent. in grammar and 
high schools. It must be remembered that these gratifying results have been accom- 
plished in a city affected by emigration and the conditions which lead to the early em- 
ployment of children, but they have not been accomplished without the liberal use of 
funds. From the report of the committee previously mentioned it appears that the aver- 
age expenditure upon a primary scholar in Boston is $18.45; upon a grammar scholar, 
$28.20; and upon a pupil of the high and normal schools, $87.42. 
The matter of school accommodation will not be satisfactorily adjusted until, in addi- 
tion to overcoming the existing deficiency, measures are devised for anticipating the 
growth of population. 
Upon this point the record of the school board for London is full of suggestion. In 
the organization of the London board the work under consideration is assigned to the sta- 
tistical committee, which is directed to ascertain the number of children of school age in 
agiven area, the number of school places already provided, and—after making the neces- 
sary deductions for illness and other causes—to recommend to the board the new schools 
that it may be necessary to provide for the balance. In reviewing the work of this 
committee for the year the chairman of the board, Mr. Edward North Buxton said : 
Looking at the extraordinarily rapid growth in some of these parishes, which is as 
certain to continue as the sun is to rise in the morning, the question arises whether we 
are always justified in waiting till the children are on the ground before providing for 
them, and whether we should not look a little more forward than we have been in the 
habit of doing in the purchase of sites and building of schools. Not only will it be an 
economical measure to anticipate by a year or two the arrival of the population, because 
the sites may be so much more cheaply purchased, but when we remember that an in- 
terval of two years elapses from the first recommendation of a school by the statistical 
committee to its opening, and thatthe numbers are in the meanwhile in many districts 
increasing annually with rapid strides, itis clear that large numbers of children will be 
left for a time without schooling, unless we have regard, not to the present population, 
but to that which we may predict with certainty will be the population two years hence. 
Probably it may be well to tabulate the annual rate of increase in each registration dis- 
trict, and have them before us in considering the accommodation needed. I commend 
this matter to the statistical committee. 
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
The legal school age in cities is determined by State laws ; the great diversity in this 
respect, there being no less than 16 different ages, makes it difficultto estimate the com- 
parative status of the cities as indicated by the reported enrolment in the schools. The 
lowest limit of the school ages is 4 years, the highest 21, and the average duration of the 
period 12.7 years. In the majority of civilized countries the period extends from 6 to 
13 or 14 years, 16 years of age being the extreme limit outside of the United States. 
A large enrolment above and below these limits is not to be expected, and all estimates 
of non-attendance founded upon the difference between the population of legal school 
age as established in the several States and enrolment or average attendance must 
necessarily be misleading. By agreement with the superintendents the inquiries sent 
out from this Office have been shaped with the purpose of ascertaining if possible the 
ratio of school attendance for the ages from 6 to 16. Only 47 cities are able to supply 
the necessary data. The number is too small to justify generalizations, but the general 
bearing of the information is significant. It is sufficiently indicated by the following 
statement, comprising the returns from eight cities:

Hon. John B. Peaslee, superintendent of public schools of Cincinnati, presents the fol- 
lowing estimates for that city: 
Estimated number of school youth between the ages of 6 and 14.._-.--_------ 51, 583 
  Actual number between those ages attending public schools 
Estimated number between those ages attending church and private schools_--. 13, 496 
Estimated number between those ages Boning charitable and ey 
institutions __   
  Total school attendance between the ages of 6 and 14 years_.-_--.------ 45, 010 
This leaves 6,573 as the number of non-attendants between those ages. 
In Binghamton, N. Y., an examination has been made which shows the ratio of 
absentees to enrolment to be as follows: From 8 to 13 years (that is, the years to which 
the compulsory law applies), 9 per cent. of the enrolments between those years; from 14 
to 16 years, 26 per cent.; from 17 to 18 years, 25 per cent.; from 19 to 20 years, 26 per 
cent. Similar results would doubtless be obtained in other cities. 
In order to arrive at a fair estimate of the number of non-attendants and irregular 
attendants upon schools who are likely to sink into illiteracy, we should have (1), as a 
common basis of calculation, the period to which compulsory school laws are applied, 
where such are enacted; (2) the school census for each of those years; and (3) the num- 
ber of non-attendants and habitual absentees for each of those years. 
In foreign countries school statistics are frequently carried into these details, and it is 
evident that in large cities where illiteracy threatens to become a startling evil such exam- 
ination is necessary .s a means of determining what the schools are doing and what 
remains for them to do. 
In accordance with its usual practice, the Office stands prepared to issue the necessary 
blank inquiries and work up the returns whenever a sufficient number of cities give 
assurance of codperation in the work. 
The following table, drawn from statistics for 1880, furnished by the Census Office, is 
important in this connection. The counties selected, it will be observed, comprise the 
chief cities of their respective States, and their population is almost entirely city popula- 
tion:

  ILLITERACY IN CITIES. CXIII 
From these figures it appears — 
(A) With reference to the race and nativity of illiterates : 
(1) That the colored illiterates exceed the total white illiterates in all the counties 
selected from the former slave States, save St. Louis City, Mo., and in no others. 
(2) That the colored (including Chinese and Indian) illiterates exceed the native born 
white illiterates in six counties, viz: 
State, County. City. 
California. San Francisco. San Francisco. 
Colorado. Arapahoe. Denver. 
Indiana. Marion. Indianapolis. 
Massachusetts. Suffolk. Boston. 
Missouri. St. Louis City. St. Louis. 
Ohio. Hamilton. ~ Cincinnati. 
(3) That the native born white illiterates exceed the foreign in five counties only, viz: 
State. County. City. 
Georgia. Fulton. “Atlanta. 
Indiana. Marion. Indianapolis. 
South Carolina. Charleston. Charleston. 
Tennessee, Davidson. Nashville. 
Virginia. E Henrico. Richmond. 
(4) That the foreign born illiterates are only slightly in excess of the native white 
illiterates in the following, viz: 
State. County. City. 
Delaware. New Castle. Wilmington. 
Kentucky. ; Jefferson. Louisville. 
Maryland. Baltimore City. Ealtimore. é 
(5) That in the remaining sixteen counties the foreign born illiterates exceed the native 
white illiterates in various ratios, the lowest being 2 to 1, and the highest 26 to 1. 
(B) With reference to sex : 
At 21 years and over the female illiterates are greatly in excess of the males; from 10 
to 14 there is a slight excess of male illiterates; pan 15 to 20 an excess of female illit- 
erates. 
(C) With reference to age : 
The number of illiterates between 15 and 20 is slightly in excess of the number be- 
tween 10 and 14, but the number of illiterates under 20 years of age forms a very small 
proportion of the total number of illiterates reported. 
From this analysis it is evident that the masses of illiterates with which the cities have 
to contend are chiefly foreign born or colored, and of adult years. It would also be in- 
ferred that the existing school provision is not equal to the requirements— 
(1) Because of the presence of illiterates from 10 to 14 years of age. (2) Because of a 
. slight increase in the number of illiterates between 15 and 20 years of age over the same 
from.10 to 14. A study of the statistics of population may possibly show that this last 
condition is due to immigration. 
From the statistics of illiteracy alone it would Rpncon that boys who are neglected in 
the earlier years of the school period are more likely than girls to make up the deficiency. 
Comparison of these figures with those of population may show that this is also an un- 
warrantable conclusion, as the relative proportion of the sexes in the large cities is con- 
tinually changed by emigration westward. 
The average daily attendance, as reported in Table II, falls far below the enrolment. 
Comparison cannot properly be made between these columns, as they are not estimated 
upon the same basis. The enrolment represents not the daily average membership, 
put all the scholars whose names appear upon the registers for a certain period, which 
may be half a day, a week, a month, &c. The fact that the average daily attendance

CxIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
is much less than the number of sittings provided is of more consequence. It is dif- 
ficult to decide whether it is more important that school provision should be made for 
all children or that all the provision made should be utilized. With due allowance for 
unavoidable absence, it is evident that truancy and irregular attendance are sufficient to 
call for repressive measures. Compulsory school laws suggest themselves as the natural 
remedy, but so far these have proved a dead letter among us, excepting in those places 
in which truant officers have been employed and means taken to create and maintain an 
intelligent public sentiment upon the subject. In the larger cities the necessity of com- 
pulsory laws can hardly be questioned, but they will prove useless in the absence of 
officers specially intrusted with their execution. Meanwhile, it should be remembered 
that everything which renders the schools attractive and brings them into intimate rela- 
tion with the requirements of ordinary life tends to overcome the evils of irregular at- 
tendance. 
PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The improvement of the primary grades, which has been in progress for several years, 
continues. Little can be done until they are relieved of overcrowding, anda number of 
cities have not passed beyond this stage of the upward movement. The highest daily 
average attendance to a teacher reported is 60; the lowest, 32. No city has reached the 
limit of 30 pupils, which is the number generally assumed as the largest compatible with 
the individual attention required by the ideal of primary training. 
Among the improved methods of instruction generally adopted are the word method 
and the phonic system in reading and the Grube system or some modification of the 
same in computation. 
Oral lessons are becoming a prominent feature of primary programmes. These are so 
arranged as to present, in admirable sequence and by means of appropriate illustrations, 
‘ideas of form, proportion, color, and the most familiar objects in nature, and when rightly 
used excite the young mind to natural and pleasing activity. While admitting the prog- 
ress that has been made, it must still be allowed that theory enters too largely into the 
method of primary teachers. It isa matter of common observation that untrained teach- 
ers sometimes achieve remarkable success in instructing children. It will generally be 
found that such persons nave quick perceptions, ready command of resources, and unusual 
ingenuity. These qualities characterize so large a proportion of American girls that any 
very general failure on the part of our primary teachers would seem to indicate a false 
system of training or a vain endeavor to meet unreasonable demands. We are far behind 
German-speaking nations in specializing normal training according to the requirements 
of different grades, but the idea is gaining recognition among us, and already several city 
normals have made a specialty of training primary teachers, with excellent results. 
If salary were the sole index of the value attaching to service, primary instruction 
~ would seem to be held in less esteem among us than that of higher grades, It need 
hardly be said that compensation is not determined solely by the importance of a work, 
and it is certainly no disparagement of primary instruction to acknowledge that nature: 
has made more liberal provision for its requirements than for those of higher grades, with 
the inevitable consequence of lessening its cost. A comparison of the present rates with 
, those which obtained several years ago will show a gradual increase in primary salaries. 
HIGHER GRADES. 
The schools intermediate between the primary and high derive peculiar importance 
from the fact that they complete the school training of a large majority of the scholars 
who enter them. Experience has shown that an extended curriculum cannot be mas- 
tered in the years covered by this grade, and it becomes necessary to make careful 
choice of the studies most valuable for elementary discipline and most necessary in the 
ordinary intercourse of society. With respect to these studies there is substantial agree- 
ment throughout the cities. The schools of intermediate grade have suffered much in
-P-A-G-E-115
  CITY SCHOOLS. CxV 
the past from defective methods, memorizing and rote recitation having here been car- 
ried to the extreme. A reform has commenced in this respect, with results which prom- 
ise well for future progress. Under this better management the theory of grammar has 
been assigned to a later period of the student’s career and its place supplied by exercises 
in composition, spoken language, and the writings of standard authors. The experiment 
has continued long enough to show that the correct use of the mother tongue is more 
readily acquired by these exercises than by drill in etymology and syntax. Less time 
is given to arithmetic than formerly, and it is believed that further reduction may be 
made without the sacrifice of any important processes. Simple book-keeping and the 
ordinary forms of business correspondence are recommended for the advanced classes of 
the grade. Penmanship is better taught than formerly, special teachers being frequently 
employed for the branch. Drawing has been introduced to some extent, and with excel- 
lent results where competent teachers have been employed. The endeavor to make 
elementary science a feature of these grades has revealed the same difficulty in this 
country that eminent English scientists have pointed out in their own, namely, the 
want of teachers prepared to give the instruction. The lifeless routine of memorized 
recitations is worse than useless in science. It paralyzes the faculties by which the facts 
of science are apprehended, and renders true progress impossible. This is a matter 
demanding attention in normal schools. In a few cities special means have been pro- 
vided for meeting the emergency. With reference to such an endeavor in Boston the 
annual report of the supervisors contains the following statement: : 
The admirable courses of lectures by the professors of the Institute of Technology upon 
different branches of natural science designed to meet the special wants of teachers have 
produced their effect upon the schools. 
City high schools are treated in connection with Table VI, as they are properly classed 
with secondary schools. The statistics of expenditure, enrolment, &c., for this grade 
are, however, tabulated in Table IT. 
From the statistics of daily average attendance it®appears that the limits are as fol- 
lows :

EVENING AND SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
Evening schools are reported in 32 cities, and, where they are maintained, appear to 
be upon a firmer basis and. more efficiently managed than a few years ago. Evening 
high schools are relatively more successful than those of low grade. This would nat- 
urally be expected. They meet the wants of a class of pupils who understand their own 
necessities and to whom, as a result of previous training, mental effort is easier and 
more delightful than to the pupils of lower grade. Evening drawing schools are greatly 
appreciated wherever they exist. , Boston and New York maintain a number of special 
day schools adapted to particular classes of children and in other cities similar provision _ 
is advocated. The school committee of Bangor, Me., urges the establishment of an un- 
graded school for the benefit of working boys who are employed in.shops and mills part of 
the year and are consequently unable to keep up with specified grades. The school board 
of Brooklyn, N. Y., has been asked to establish industrial schools forthe benefit of poor 
children not in public schools. In a number of cities arrangements are made by which 
the children in orphan asylums attend public schools and the schools of reformatory* 
institutions for children are brought into the system of public schools. Everywhere a  
-P-A-G-E-116

disposition is manifest to adjust the public schools to the wants of all classes and condi- 
tions of youth ; the single exception to this tendency is the neglect of children under 
five years of age. Here we are met with one of the gravest and most interesting prob- 
Jems of modern life and one in reference to which we have much to learn from European 
nations. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
By reference to Table II, appendix, it will be seen that the report of school finances 
from most of the cities is so full that the entire cost of the free schools and the expendi- 
ture for each particular branch of the service may be estimated. The expense per capita 
of average attendance does not vary so much as might be expected from the diversity of 
conditions represented in the cities. The charge of extravagant expenditure is hardly 
borne out by the record, from which it appears that the expense per capita is not above 
$25 in more than 13 cities. 
The annual salaries of principals of primary schools range from $365 to $1,215; sal- 
aries of grammar school principals range for men from $720 to $2,250, for women from 
$612 to $1,420, and the salaries of assistants in grammar schools from $350 to $2,280 
tor men, and for women from $200 to $895    
      MORAL AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
The relation of the public schools to moral and physical education is justly regarded 
as a matter of vital importance. That their influence in respect to the former is greater 
and more excellent than their enemies pretend, no candid and competent judge can 
doubt. Sectarianism is not and probably never will be allowed any place in their pro- 
‘grammes ; neither is it the purpose of the American people to commit the religious 
\ instruction of their children to this agency. The home and the church are the pro, 
instrumentalities for this work, andif they are not equal to the requirements it is evi- 
dence that they need reform or that influences are tolerated amongst us which are fatal 
to their proper action. It is enough that the schools are notirreligious in their tendency 
and that by the precepts which they inculcate, the principles which they maintain, and 
the habits which they develop they are continually promotive of good morals. 
With respect to the physical training of youth it must be admitted that Americans 
make no provision for it by means of their schools, homes, or any other institution, In 
this matter school officers are not more negligent than the public generally; indeed, their 
efforts to improve the sanitary condition of school buildings and to intersperse the in- 
tellectual exercises of school with suitable physical exercises are often thwarted by ' 
public apathy or the parsimony of those who control the public funds. 
So far as it can be shown that the schools are injurious to health or an obstacle to the 
best physical development of the young, so far they should be immediately reformed. 
It does not follow—nor is there yet any conclusive evidence —that the schools offer the 
best medium for physical training; on this subject we are just beginning to engage the 
efforts of specialists. School officers have not been indifferent to the progress of sanitary 
knowledge, as is shown by the fact that periodical inspection of school-houses, with reports 
of their condition and suggestions for their improvement, is required in a number of 
cities. For further details with reference to city schools, the reader is referred to the 
heading City School Systems in the abstracts of the respective States.

The comparative summary of normal schools shows a net increase of 5 schools, 107 
instructors, and 5,628 students over the figures for 1880. The total increase in the num- 
ber of normals reporting is 18, the total decrease 13, the increase being chiefly in public 
normal schools or departments for colored teachers in the South and the decrease chiefly 
in private normals. The number of city normal schools is 147, representing cities in 13 
States ; the number of State normals, 90, representing all but five of the States. Only 
one county normal was reported upon returns to the statistical division, viz, Normal and 
Training School, Cook County, Illinois; a few others are mentioned in the abstracts. 
Of the whole number of normals, 113 are public, as against 106 in 1880. 
The public normals differ widely in respect to income, appliances, &c.; a few, as may 
be inferred from the duration of the course, have the characteristics of normal institutes 
rather than of normal schools. 
Considered by geographical position the public normals are distributed as follows : 
New England States (6) -_- 
1 Middle Atlantic States (6) _    
   
  
     
  Sothern Atlantic States (4)- z 9 
Gulf States (4) 8 
Southern Central States (6) - 16 
Northern Central States (9)_ 25 
States of the Pacific slope (3) 2 
Territories (11) 5 
These schools are supported by public funds, subject to inspection by State, county, 
or city authorities, and for the most part confer a diploma upon their graduates which 
_ is accepted in lieu of an examination for the position of teacher in the common school. In

    NORMAL SCHOOLS. CXXVII 
a few States there is a permanent endowment fund for normal schools, but as a rule they 
are sustained by annual appropriations. The estimates are very closely scrutinized, and 
the debates to which they give rise often become the scene of violent opposition to the 
schools themselves. It is gratifying to note that the investigations prompted by these 
periodical attacks have invariably resulted in the vindication of the particular school 
involved and the consequent strengthening of the system of normal training. 
The experience of the Connecticut State Normal School is significant. In 1867, it will 
be remembered, the opponents of the school had so far prevailed that all appropriation 
was withheld and the school suspended for two years. Opposition was renewed after 
the school reopened, but the final issue has been a grand rally for its support; by the 
unanimous action of both houses of the Connecticut legislature $75,000 were appropri- 
ated in 1881 for a new building upon the condition, already fulfilled, that New Britain 
should add $25,000. This result reflects great credit upon the judicious management of 
those who have had the conduct of the school through its struggles. 
APPROPRIATIONS FOR NORMAL SCHOOLS. . 
Appropriations for normal schools average a little higher than in 1880. The six 
largest appropriations were as follows: Philadelphia Normal School for Girls, Philadel- 
phia, Pa., $25,000; State Normal School, Whitewater, Wis., $25,188; California State 
Normal School, San José, Cal., $33,300; Michigan State Normal School, Ypsilanti, Mich., 
$44,500; Connecticut State Normal School, New Britain, Conn., $87,000; Normal Col- 
lege, New York City, $95,000. 
The largest public appropriations to normal schools in the 12 States aided by the Pea_ 
body fund were $20,000 to the Sam Houston Normal Institute, Huntsville, Tex., and 
$7,600 to the Normal School of Texas for Colored Students, Prairie View. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO NORMAL AND TO PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
‘The tendency is noticeable in the public normals to increase the length of the course 
and to give it more and more a professional character. In view of these efforts it is 
important that the relative standing of normal schools and schools of law, medicine, 
&c., should be understood. The following statements indicate the admission require- 
ments of these several classes of institutions : 
Boston Normal School. 
Candidates for admission must be at least eighteen years of age, unless an exception* 
is made by a special vote of the committee in charge, and must be recommended for 
admission by the master or committee of the last school they attended. 
A certificate that a candidate has completed the fourth year of the high school course , 
is accepted as proof of qualification for admission. The course of study in the Boston high » 
schools embraces the following subjects : Composition; rhetoric; English literature; an- 
cient, medisval, and modern history; civil government; boiany; zodlogy; anatomy and 
physiology; chemistry; physics; astronomy; arithmetic, including the metric system; 
algebra; geometry; plane trigonometry; Latin, or French, or German; vocal music, and 
drawing. Candidates who have not completed the fourth year of the Boston High School 
course will be examined on this or its equivalent. 
State Normal School, Worcester, Mass. 
Candidates must show upon examination good capacity and general intelligence, and 
also fair attainments in the following branches, viz: reading, spelling, penmanship, 
geography, arithmetic, English grammar, history of the United States. 
Express warning is given against trying to enter in the hope of ‘‘making up”’ defi- 
ciency in any of these departments.   Normal College, New York. 
Candidates must pass an examination in algebra, arithmetic, grammar, geography, 
history, spelling, and drawing.

of the following branches as he may elect: French, German, the elements of algebra or 
of plane geometry, botany. 
Dartmouth Medical College. 
Applicants for admission must be eighteen years of age, and, unless already matricu- 
lates of this institution or graduates of some reputable college.academy, or high school, 
will be examined as to their fitness for entering uponand appreciating the technical study

They will be expected to be familiar with the elementary principles of physics (light, 
heat, electricity, &c.) on entrance. 
  Boston University School of Bedicine. 
Candidates who have taken their first degree in arts, philosophy, or science are 
admitted without examination. 
All others, before matriculation, are examined in the following branches: (1) In 
orthography, English composition, and penmanship; (2) in arithmetic, geography, and

irregular verbs and the first two books of Voltaire’s Charles XII or an equivalent; Eng- 
lish grammar and composition; geography. 
    
    
COURSEs OF STUDY AT HOM 
  AND ABROAD. 
By a comparigon of Table IIT with Tables XII and XIII, ‘appendix, it will be seen 
that the average duration of the course in normal schools is about the same as that of 
schools of law or medicine. 
The fxeulties of normal schools and educators generally seem to be rapidly approach- 
ing agreement as to the essentials of :. pedagogic course. Whether there be or be not a 
science of education is still matter of dispute. but both parties in the discussion allow 
thatthe body of facts and principles derived from psychology, physiology, and the his- 
tory of methods of training should be included in the normal studies. Itisalso admitted

that the student must have the opportunity of observing for himself and of practising 
the art in which he desires to become proficient. The extent to which provision is made 
for the latter requirement is indicated by the table. Seventy-two public and 42 private 
normals, it will be seen, report ‘‘model’’ departments, while a number not so sup- 
plied make arrangements for their undergraduates to teach in other schools. This sub- 
stitute plan is open to objection, and, excepting under the most judicious management, 
is of doubtful utility, the direction and criticism of an experienced principal who has 
some personal interest in the result being quite as Roper aay in the practical as in the 
theoretical part of the training of normal students. 
The proportion of normal schools reporting gymnasiums is greater than in previous 
years, but less than should be the case, considering the importance of physical training in 
a scheme of popular education. Of all agencies the normal schools can do most to pro- 
mote the systematic training of the body; their graduates are sought for the very schools 
in which the need of the exercise is most apparent, while, moreover, it is matter of 
experience that the notions of school training adopted in the normal schools affect to 
some extent all classes of elementary schools. Not only should a gymnasium be an 
adjunct of every normal school, but physiology, hygiene, and sanitation should be 
included in the curriculum as affording invaluable knowledge to teachers. 
The assembling of many persons in the same room is well known to be a condition 
prejudicial to health; in the case of children in a school the teacher is the only person’ 
who can be relied upon to maintain the counteracting influences. It is to teachers, 
moreover, that we must look in some measure for the diffusion of knowledge with refer- 
ence to the lawsof health. ‘‘I have long ceased to doubt,’ says Dr. Schrodt, ‘‘that, apart 
from the effects of wounds, the chances of health or disease are in our own hands; and, if 
people knew only half the facts pointing that way, they would feel ashamed to be sick 
or to have sick children.’’ This may seem an extreme statement, but the progress made 
in sanitary knowledge leaves no reasonable doubt that human misery may be greatly 
diminished by a general regard of the laws of health. The subject should be pressed 
upon the attention’of every normal student and be made as familiar to the minds of 
children as the rudiments of language and numbers. * 
A larger number of schools report laboratories, museums, &c., than in previous years. 
With the increasing demand for science teaching, it is hard to understand the opposition 
manifested in some quarters to appropriations for appliances. The Ilinois legislature 
was the scene of a special manifestation of this false economy during the present year, 
when the appropriations for the Southern Illinois Normal School were under discussion. 
The outcome was the reduction of the item of $1,250 for the library to $500 and the 
utter rejection of the proposition for $500 per annum for the laboratory and $700 for the 
museum, a result effected by men of the very class who declaim against cramming and 
memorizing and demand practical training in the schools. 
The action of the Illinois legislature offers an unfavorable contrast to the efforts made 
in other sections of the United States to promote the study of science among teachers. 
The course of lectures before the Teachers’ School of Scierice, Boston, consisted for 
the year 1880-81 of eight lessons on physics, by Prof. Charles R. Cross ; eight on zodl- 
ogy, by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt ; four on botany, by Prof. George L. Goodale, and four on 
geology, by Mr. W. O. Crosby. These lessons were illustrated by experiments and 
specimens in the hands of each student, and were exceedingly interesting as well as 
instructive. The course was in charge of the Natural History Society ;.but the entire 
expense for lectures, specimens, &c., was borne by Mrs. Augustus Hemmenway and 
Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw. Four hundred teachers of Boston and vicinity constituted the 
class. : 
The catalogue of the Lawrence Scientific School, Harvard University, announces that : 
The school also offers facilities to teachers and to persons preparing to be teachers 
who desire to qualify themselves in the modern methods of teaching science by observa- 
tion and experiment. A year’s course of study, adapted to this purpose, may be selected

lowing subjects: physical geography and elementary geology; general chemistry and 
qualitative analysis; mineralogy; physics; botany; comparative anatomy and physiology; 
zodlogy. 5 f 
This course is flexible and comprehensive; the instruction is mainly given in the lab- 
oratories and museums of the university, and is of the most practical character, every 
student being taught to make experiments and study specimens. 
There are also scholarships in the scientific school, not exceeding eight at any one 
time, of the annual value of $150 each, for the benefit of graduates of the State normal 
schools. The manner in which these scholarships are divided among the normal schools 
is determined by the State-board of education. 
Similar measures have been inaugurated for the benefit of teachers in other States, 
but no report of them has been received at the Office. 
In this connection it is proper to recall the views set forth in the London Times and 
in Nature with reference to the debate in the British Parliament in 1878 upon Sir John 
Lubbock’s motion for the addition of elementary science to the subjects for which grants 
should be given under the education code. The Times says: é 
To be taught something about gravitation, about atmospheric pressure, about the 
effects of temperature, and other simple matters of like kind, which would admit of 
experimental illustration and which would call upon the learner to make statements in 
his own words instead of in those of somebody else, would be so many steps toward real 
mental development. At the end of a vacation, even if the facts of any particular oc- 
currence had become somewhat mixed, the pupils would nevertheless preserve an in- 
creased capacity for acquiring new facts, and would probably retain these for a longer 
period; and such are precisely the changes which it should be the province of education 
to bring about. We would even go further than Sir John Lubbock, and in elementary 
schools would give an important place to the art of drawing, which teaches accurate ob- 
servation of the forms of things. The efforts of a wise teacher should always be guided 
with reference to the position and surroundings of a child at home, and should ‘seek to 
supplement the deficiencies of home training and example. Among the wealthier classes 
the floating information of the family circle often, though by no means always, both ex- 
cites and gratifies a curiosity about natural phenomena; but among the poor this stim- 
ulus to mental growth is almost, if not entirely, wanting. 
A writer in Nature, referring to the article in the Times, from which the above extract 
is taken, observed: 
In itself the article may present nothing remarkable to the readers of Nature, but, as 
the deliberate utterance of the leading organ of opinion in this country, it marks a dis- 
tinct stage of progress toward a more enlightened conception of what constitutes educa- 
tion. * 
The same writer, in concluding his article, said: 
Every day we hear of the ignorance of the working classes; every other month ‘‘con- 
gresses’’ are held to devise means to remedy the consequences of this ignorance: igno- 
rance of the laws of health, ignorance of household economy, ignorance of the implements 
and objects of labor, ignorance of the laws of labor and production, ignorance of the nat- 
ure of the commonest objects with which they come into contact every day, ignorance 
of almost everything which it would be useful and nationally beneficial for them to 
‘know —an ignorance, alas! more or less shared by the ‘‘ curled darlings” of the nation. 
Yet, while every day’s paper shows how keen is the industrial competition with other 
nations and how in one department after another we are being outstripped by the re- 
sults of better—i. e., more scientific—knowledge, the poor pittance of ‘elementary 
Anowledge”’ asked for in Sir John Lubbock’s bill is refused. ‘ 
Those who have watched the progress of elementary schools in England are aware that 
‘the movement in favor of science has led to the very result which we are endeavoring 
to accomplish in our normal schools, viz, the preparation of teachers to give the instruc- 
tion required. ; 
Normal school training should embody, and in the best schools does embody, the re- 
sults of the most careful and the most intelligent consideration of the subjects, methods, 
and aims of popular education. This relation to the whole work of elementary educa- 
tion gives special importance to every new point in the progressive history of this class 
of schools. The annual reports of the principals of the most efficient normals afford

matter which might advantageously be brought to the attention of all teachers and of 
all persons who, either in the capacity of parents, voters, legislators, or critics, are inter- 
ested in the education of children. It is impossible to read these records and follow 
the progress of the work to which they give formal expression without being impressed 
with certain characteristics of our system of training teachers. It is in essence rational, 
flexible, and progressive. 
It would be easy to indicate particulars in which foreign systems ene ourown. In 
England the scholastic standard is perhaps higher. Upon the Continent there is a better 
classification of normals and a more methodical arrangement of details. We may study 
these examples with profit, but we have nothing to gain by their servile imitation. 
The attention of our educators has been frequently directed to the German and French 
training schools; we have had less occasion for considering the status of the same work 
in Great Britain. The following statements from the report of the committee of council © 
on education in England and Wales, and the same in Scotland, afford, it is believed, 
some valuable points of suggestion and comparison : 
With the view of encouraging the study of scientific subjects in training colleges, it 
has of late years been arranged that success in the examinations in science, held by the 
science and art department, shall be taken into account in determining the students’ 
places in the class list of candidates for certificates as teachers of public. schools. The 
record of examinations under this provision in 1881—’82 is as follows: 
  
Males. | Females. 
  
      England and Wales: 
Total number examined 1,349 1,298 
‘Total number of passes. 1,713 475 
Scotland: * 
‘Total number examined 306 0 
295 ° Total number of passes. 
    
It will be observed that a number of students passed in more than one subject. 
Languages now enter into the course of study in all the training colleges for masters 
and in several of those for mistresses. French is the language most generally taken; 
Latin comes next. 
In Scotland the system introduced by the code of 1873, of combining attendance at 
university classes with the efficient course of practical professional training provided by 
the inspected training colleges, is producing satisfactory results. In 1880, 146 students 
availed themselves of this arrangement; the number at the latest report was 117 attend- 
ing the following classes: Latin, Greek, mathematics, English literature, natural phi- 
losophy, and logic. 
It is proper to observe that in Great Britain and in European countries generally 
pedagogic training leads to more permanent employment and amore definite career than 
in the United States. 
‘TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
One of the most important subjects engaging the attention of school. authorities in the 
United States is the adaptation of normal training to the improvement of the great body 
of teachers who supply the rural schools. It is needless to suggest that a large propor- 
tion of these teachers are persons of very ordinary attainments, with little or no special 
preparation for their work. Summer normals, normal or teachers’ institutes, and the 
special or shorter courses offered by some of the regular normals have grown out of the 
necessity of doing something to save the country schools from the dubious efforts of un- 
trained novices. These agencies have proved so efficient that they have been made an

integral part of the school system, and their organization and conduct are among the 
most prominent topics of discussion in the various pedagogical associations of the States. 
Detailed statements of the institutes held during the year will be found in the ab- 
stracts of the appendix under the head of Training of Teachers. 
NORMAL TRAINING IN THE COLLEGES. 
The science and art of education attract more and more attention in universities and 
colleges. Chairs of pedagogics are reported as having existed last year in the Uni- 
versities of Michigan, Missouri, and Iowa. The course of lectures delivered during the 
year by G. Stanley Hall, pH. D., for the benefit of Boston teachers, indicates the interest 
of Harvard University in this matter. 
In his annual report for 1880-’81, President Eliot makes the following statement with 
reference to Mr. Hall’s lectures: 
In the first four months of 1881, G. Stanley Hall, pH. D., university lecturer on 
pedagogy for the year 1880-’81, gave a course of twelve lectures on Saturday mornings © 
at Wesleyan Hall, Boston, to an audience composed chiefly of teachers. The action of 
the university in directing attention to the philosophy of teaching and in causing Dr. 
Hall’s lectures to be delivered at a time and place convenient for the teachers of Boston 
and the vicinity, was received with favor by many persons interested in the subject, and 
the corporation received, at the close of the course, the public thanks of the teachers 
who had attended it. 
The following statement from a recent paper by W. H. Payne, professor of the science 
- and the art of teaching in the University of Michigan, sets- forth the work as conducted 
in that university and answers several inquiries which have arisen: 
The chair of the science and the art of teaching was established by a unanimous vote 
of the board of regents, June 29,1879. This subject had long before received the care- 
ful consideration of President Angell and had been commended to the attention of the 
regents in his annual reports. Before asking the regents to take formal action in the 
matter, the president submitted the plan to the faculty in the department of literature, 
science, and the arts, and by a unanimous vote it was commended to the board of re- 
ents. . 
8 This action of the president, faculty, and regents was based on a state of facts of long 
standing. The University of Michigan, as the highest educational institution in the 
State and as the head of our educational system, had for years been supplying the higher 
positions in the public school service with teachers. As a rule these teachers assumed 
the responsibilities of important positions with no conscious preparation; and it was con- 
ceived a duty owing to the State to furnish prospective teachers with an opportunity to 
learn at least the theory of teaching and of school management. This state of facts be- 
comes more significant when it is recollected (1) that the principal high schools of the 
State are preparatory schools to the university, (2) that these schools naturally look to 
the university for their principals and assistant teachers, and (3) that these secondary 
schools educate large numbers of teachers for the common schools. It seemed, then, 
that the teaching service of the State might be usefully affected by making the science 
and the art of teaching a regular branch of instruction in the university. 
It should be stated, at the outset, that there is no ‘‘normal department”’ in the Uni- 
versity of Michigan. There are merely courses of instruction in the science and the art of 
teaching, just as there are in science and in mathematics, save that, while the former are 
wholly elective, some of the latter are required; but, in both cases, the courses count 
toward a degree. What is called a ‘teachers’ diploma’? is given under the following 
requiremenis: (1) The pupil must have taken at least the bachelor’s degree; (2) must 
have taken a teachers’ course in Latin, Greek, or in some other subject; and (3) must 
have taken at least one of the longer courses in the science and the art of teaching. But 
this diploma has no legal value whatever. It merely certifies to the accomplishment of 
certain work. It exempts from no examination. There has never been a thought of 
interfering, in the least degree, with the work of the State Normal School. From the 
very nature of things, the normal school and the university cannot be competitors in a 
way that will noticeably affect either institution. In the first place, it is not at all 
probable that any pupil will apply for admission to the university fer the sole purpose 
of studying pedagogics. At best, this would occupy only one-half his time. If he 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
BUSINESS COLLEGES. CXXxII 
  enters at all, he will almost inevitably pursue courses that are not offered by the normal 
school, which, in its academic work, is merely a school of secondary instruction. Asa 
matter of fact, there has not been the slightest effect injurious to the normal school 
through the introduction of courses in pedagogics into the university. The present 
year of the normal school is one of the most prosperous in its entire history. 
At their best, these two schools can do but a fraction of the service the State requires 
in the education of teachers. A part of this work would not be done at all if not done 
by the university, not even.if there were three normal schools, as there should be if the 
teaching force of the State is to be even moderately recruited. It might be reasonably 
expected that if the professional education of teachers should receive a larger share of 
public attention through the introduction of this subject into the university the general 
effect must be favorable to the normal school. * * * 
For the year 1879-’80: two courses of instruction were offered, as follows: (1) practi- 
cal, devoted to the organization and management of public schools and to the more 
important details of school room work; (2) theoretical, devoted to the teaching of a 
body of, public school doctrine. Each course occupied two hours per week for a half 
year. es 
For the year 1880-’81 both the above courses were raised to four-hour courses, that is, 
the time given to each was doubled. Scarcely any change was made in the management 
of course 1 and the result was quite as satisfactory as in the preceding year. In course 
2, instead of teaching wholly by lecture, as 1 had done at first, I made Bain’s Education 
as a Science the basis of my instruction. This gave me several advantages that at this 
stage of my work were essential: (1) There was a body of doctrine formulated and 
printed and recommended by a distinguished name; (2) my teaching, based on a printed 
text, could be made definite. The subject proved to be difficult, but the very difficul- 
ties inspired my pupils with a respect for the study. Better than this, the doctrines were 
found to be very fruitful in their practical applications, and so there emerged a new 
spirit: a taste for philosophizing on educational questions. I would do myself injustice 
(a thing no one has a moral right to do) if I were to allow the inference that none of this 
spirit was awakened in the first year of the course; but it fell far short of what I desired 
and expected. On the whole, the gain was considerable, and I began to feel some degree 
of satisfaction with what I thought to be my real work in the university: that of teach- 
ing a body of educational doctrine as the basis of a rational art of teaching. 
From the summary here presented it is evident that pedagogic training in the United 
States has developed a natural gradation. 
Summer normals and normal institutes, normal schools having one or two years’ course, 
normal schools haying four years’ course, and chairs of pedagogy in the universities cor- 
respond to different demands in the same general department. They are practical expe- 
dients created for the most part as the want was felt and afterwards found justifiable upon. 
philosophic principles. There is needed just now a mind at once philosophic and practical 
to differentiate and systematize these several agencies, to adjust each to its province and 
coérdinate all together in the interest of the various requirements of the school service 
of our country.

aIncludes some pupils receiving primary instruction. 
It is unnecessary to call attention to the rapid advance of Kindergiirten in number 
and popularity. The increase of pupils over those reported last year has been 60 per 
cent. This prosperity is indicated strongly in that their claims upon the public for 
support and encouragement are being attended to more frequently, their methods are 
approved, their spirit is commended, their principles acknowledged to be correct, and 
their beneficence urged by educators and philanthropists. In these matters and in 
many others the Kindergarten occupies a position of promise, and its advocates and , 
teachers are assured of an ever increasing field of labor and usefulness. 
The San Francisco Public Kindergarten Society has recently published a report of prog- 
ress during its first three years of existence. It was organized in the summer of 1878 
by public minded citizens urged forward by the arguments and influence of Prof. Felix 
Adler, of New York, then visiting San Francisco. The object of the society is “‘to 
establish free Kindergiirten, with a view of conferring the benefit of Kindergarten 
education upon the children of the poor, of rescuing them from the vicious examples 
of the street, saving them from the cruel consequences of neglect, and so to develop in 
them the elements of skill that they may become useful and honorable members of 
society in later years.’? The first Kindergarten was established in September, 1878, in 
adestitute section of the city. It met much opposition, but was enabled to carry on its 
work by the support of steadfast friends and the approval of the intelligent citizens who 
were watching its progress. At length it won popular favor. Now it is “‘talked over 
in every class of society, in every corner of the city,’ and ‘‘is discussed charitably,
-P-A-G-E-136

financially, industrially, religiously, artistically, morally, intellectually, and educa- 
tionally.’’ Six schools have sprung up to extend the work commenced by the earliest. 
Attendance is measured by the capacity of the rooms. Thought is given to the instruc- 
tion, to the care and comfort of the pupils, and to their homes and parents, so that the 
good results of these schools are far reaching. The charity work of Kindergiirten has 
ever been a prominent feature in their operations. Not in San Francisco alone do the 
schools send comfort, courage, and germs of intelligence into dark and desolate homes 
through the children gathered in them, but in other cities women of culture and wealth 
have bestowed time, labor, and money on similar enterprises. As Mrs. Cooper and her 
Bible class have aided the extension of the Kindergarten in San Francisco, so churches, 
societies, and individuals have labored for them and through them in eastern cities. 
Boston is dotted with schools established by Mrs. Q. A. Shaw, in which children receive 
care, education, and clothing, if necessary. The number of schools and nurseries owing 
their existence to her is said to be forty, and other ladies in the same city have imitated 
her to a less extent. In Chicago Mrs. E. W. Blatchford has established a school at her 
own expense. A full sketch of the charitable Kindergarten work in this country would 
be replete with incidents illustrative of the value of these efforts for the children of the 
poor and a most interesting chapter in the history of home missionary work. . 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND KINDERGARTEN. 
The experience of St. Louis with Kindergiirten in connection with the public schools 
has been extensive and instructive. During the school year 1880-’81, 8,635 children 
eee Kindergarten instruction either alone or in ¢onnection with primary teach- 
_ Even in that city the ingrafting process by which the public school system is joined 
to ee Kindergarten is not complete or satisfactory. The stepsand methods of transition 
from its schools and instruction to the methods adopted in the ordinary public school 
are not determined beyond question. A favorable solution of the difficulties is, how- 
ever, anticipated, though the differences to be harmonized are serious. Superintendent 
Hon. Edward H. Long speaks of them as follows: 
The former [Kindergarten] recognizes education as the unfolding of spirit, a process of 
developing or bringing to consciousness that which exists potentially within. The 
knowledge of the external is the means, not the end, and the methods are definite for 
the accomplishment of its end. The old method of primary instruction recognizes, or 
at least proceeds as if it recognized, the external as the end, and, if the notion is enter- 
tained that somehow intellectual or moral culture is involved, it is vague, and only in- 
definite means are adopted to accomplish such end. 
Miss M. J. Lyschinska, writing from an English standpoint on difficulties in infant 
schools, touches the questions of the relations of Kindergiirten to the primary grade of 
public schools. Her idea seems to be that it is not always practicable to bring children 
. toa prescribed point in intellectual acquirement at a given age, but that different chil- 
dren require different periods for the acquisition of the knowledge required for profitable 
entrance into the public schools. The time allowed should be long enough for the child’s 
mind and nature to be unfolded in a Kindergarten up to where it has (in a symmetric 
growth) acquired the knowledge specifically needed for entrance upon the usual school rou- 
tine, in connection with the graces and powers brought into service by judicious Kinder- 
garten training. She attempts no solution of the question how children accustomed to 
instruction according to Kindergarten principles are to acquiesce readily in the tiresome 
methods 6f common teaching. Perhaps it needs none. The president of the New York 
Normal College, Thomas Hunter, PH. D., reports on the effects of Kindergiirten in such 
a way as to banish doubts on this point. He says: 
The question naturally arises, what is the effect of the Kindergarten instruction on the 
children when they reach the higher grades of the school? The effect has been tested 
by comparing them with children who have not had the benefits of the Kindergarten; 
and we have invariably found that the children trained in the Kindergarten are brighter,
-P-A-G-E-137
  KINDERGARTEN INSTRUCTION. * CXXXVII 
quicker, and more intelligent; and that especially in all school work, such as writing 
and drawing, requiring muscular power and flexibility in the wrist and fingers they 
preéminently excel. ‘ 
It would be hard to find teachers of lower grade publicschools who would report with 
general unanimity such results from their system of instruction as the Kindergartners 
claim for theirs, which are shown in Table V of the appendix to this report, pp. 413-447. 
These effects are summed up by an English lecturer as follows: 
What the Kindergarten has to show are happy, healthy, good natured children; no 
proficiency in learning of any kind, no precocity; but just children in their normal state. 
‘The Kindergarten rejects reading, writing, ciphering, spelling. In it children under six 
build, plait, fold, model, sing, act; in short they learn in play to work, to construct, to 
invent, to relate and speak correctly, and—what is best of all—to love each other, to be 
kind to each other, to help each other. One thing more I must mention which children 
do learn in the Kindergarten and which comprises all their infantine accomplishments : 
they learn to play together, an accomplishment of the greatest moral importance to 
children of all ages. 
Although there is a variance between the Kindergarten and the common methods of 
instruction, the confident expectation of many observers is that the hindrance to their 
union will be overcome. The public connot afford to lose the benefit of Kindergarten prin- 
ciples and influences. A widely circulated magazine, whose words are of weight with 
a numerous class of citizens, is reported as saying that ‘‘ probably the day will come when 
school boards will realize that the Kindergarten, which brings under proper influences 
the rough little wanderers on the city streets, is a school which cannot be too carefully 
tended and heartily encouraged.” 
NORMAL KINDERGARTEN INSTRUCTION. 
The efforts to train Kindergarten teachers are to be highly commended. This system 
of instruction is not so transparent that the untutored can comprehend its principles and 
apply them profitably. Its simplicity is not that of a first thought, but that of a per- 
fected idea, a finished structure. The nature and peculiarities of instructing children 
are not readily perceived by the inexperienced mind. Those who would educate them 
in accordance with their individual characteristics must know upon what material they 
are putting an impress and how they may make it the most effective of good. The mere 
proposition of a person to open a school for Kindergarten instruction does not make it cer- 
tain that the person is qualified for the undertaking and will lead the children that attend 
into the paths of highest gain. Practical work under an experienced teacher is needed 
for the training of a Kindergartner. This position might be supported by quotations 
from numerous authoritiesin Kindergarten education. Miss Kate D. Smith, of the Silver 
Street Kindergarten, San Francisco, says: 
The first companion of children should be an adeptin the scienceand art of education. 
It is impossible to get any practical idea of Frébel’s, philosophy without earnest study 
under a capable instructor; it is impossible to execute the work in the different Frébel 
occupations and bring it to its legitimate end without guidance and direction; and it is 
utterly and entirely impossible to catch the necessary inspiration unless the student passes 
the period of her training in the Kindergarten itself. 
Dr. Hunter considers ‘‘an able and thoroughly trained Kindergartner’’ the first con- 
dition of success in Kindergarten work. Miss E. Shirreff, president of the London Frébel 
Society, writes: 4 
If the teacher be really wise and careful, then is the class soon, in very truth, the 
garden where children grow and expand as nature directs, all hindrance cleared away 
and all help given to make the growth healthy and equal in all its parts. If she lacks 
those qualities, then the system fails in her hands; but, instead of undervaluing the 
system, we should only deplore that here also—as, alas! too often elsewhere—the holy 
work of education is trusted to the half educated. 
Rules have been issued by the Austrian minister of instruction in respect to normal 
Kindergarten training. Pupils in the normal schools are to visit a Kindergarten once

aweek in their third year and spend a considerable portion of their practice time during 
the next year under the direction of the Kindergartner. Those wishing to become Kin- 
dergarten instructors must also pursue special studies. The minimum age for entering 
the courses is sixteen years. A certificate of fitness is issued to pupils of the training 
school for female teachers who have received the instruction in music and gymnastics, 
passed the final examinations, taken the course in the occupations, and given evidence 
of theoretical and practical knowledge of the Kindergarten. The right to conduct an 
independent Kindergarten may be granted to those who can show at least two years’ 
successful practice in such work. 
ESSENTIAL NEEDS OF A KINDERGARTEN. 
A translation of a German statement of the essential needs of a. Kindergarten recently 
appeared in the New Education. It is worthy of a careful reading by all interested or 
engaged in this method of instruction, and is as follows: 
(1) Rooms.—According to the number of pupils, two or three spacious rooms are 
needed, also an anteroom for their wrappings. The largest room is used for the move- 
ment games, the others for the occupations and games at the tables. In the latter there 
are needed, besides tables and chairs, two glass cases; in one of these the occupation 
material is kept, irt the other the work of the children, curiosities, specimens, &c., are 
preserved. The walls are furnished with the necessary cards, pictures, &e. 
(2) The garden, which should not be wanting in a normal Kindergarten, must offer the 
necessary room for 4 playground (for the warm season sufficiently shaded by trees), for a 
sufficient number of garden beds, and for the cultivation of common plants, herbs, and 
shrubs for purposes of instruction. 
(3) The guidance of the Kindergarten is to be intrusted only to well prepared Kinder- 
gartners. They must have passed at least a year in a good training school, and must 
have had some experience in practice under reliable direction. In addition, the Kinder- 
gartner should be of a gentle disposition and should love children. Musically, she 
should be able to sing the Kindergarten songs ina pleasing though not voluminous 
voice and to teach them correctly. 
(4) The number of pupils for one Kindergartner should not be many more than twenty; 
at least this number should not be exceeded in private or family Kindergiirten, since it 
is impossible for one person to superintend more children and to attend to individual 
wants and to proceed methodically. In public Kindergiirten financial considerations may 
render it difficult to adhere to this limit; yet, if there is to be a shadow of methodical 
training, a.second Kindergartner must be employed as soon as the number of children 
exceeds forty, so that two separate divisions may be formed. 
(5) The time table must be so arranged that the spontaneous wishes of the children may 
be respected; all pedantry in following it should be avoided; and it should be readily 
modified by the inclinations of the children, the season, the weather, &c. The Kinder- 
garten must never be made into a school and must ever be a place for spontaneous play 
and work on the part of the children. All undue physical and mental exertion is to be 
avoided, and the various ages are to be taken into account. 
(6) The supervision is to be placed in the hands of ladies, more particularly of mothers, 
who understand best the wants of early childhood. This does not exclude aid on the 
part of gentlemen who have the necessary pedagogic culture. All who are intrusted 
with the supervision should be theoretically and practically familiar with Frébel’s 
methods of education. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
Secondary instruction is an expression employed to indicate a grade between element- 
ary and superior instruction, but varying in different countries according to the greater 
or less extent to which provision is made for liberal culture and for special training. The 
statistical summary on page cxl of pupils receiving secondary instruction shows that the
-P-A-G-E-139
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. CXXXIX 
expression ‘‘secondary instruction’’ has a wide application in the United States. The 
total of these pupils is 224,815, or about 1 in every 223 of the population. A number — 
of the schools in Tables VI and VII have preparatory departments to which children 
are admitted as young as 6 years of age; under favorable circumstances the course which 
is strictly preparatory to college is commenced-at 10 or 11 years of age. Secondary in- 
struction proper begins at about 13 years of age and is from 2 to 6 years in duration. 
High and normal schools are regulated by the school laws of their respective States or 
cities; preparatory schools sustain the most intimate relation to the colleges and univer- 
sities; secondary schools are variously constituted and controlled. ‘These several classes 
of institutions have so many points both of agreement and contrast that neither sepa- 
rate nor collective characterization affords an exact estimate of their operations. 
High schools are apparently strengthened by the opposition which they from time to 
time encounter. The history of free schools in the North and West, their more recent 
development in the South, and the experience of foreign nations in the same direction 
afford convincing evidence that no system of public education can maintain an efficient 
existence without high schools, or the grade of instruction given in them. It is neither 
possible nor desirable that they should absorb all the functions of secondary education, 
but it is undoubtedly true that they offer the only adequate means for the accomplish- 
ment of some of its chief purposes. The transformations which are constantly de- 
manded by the development of society are most readily brought to pass in institutions 
which are a common interest to all classes and which have resources practically unlimited. 
The present is a transition period in our country, and those familiar with the inside his- 
tory of our schools are aware that the high schools are taking the initiative in the adjust- 
ment of educational processes. This fact was strikingly illustrated in the dedication of 
the noblestructure in Boston for the accommodation of the Latin and English high schools. 
Here were represented all subjects of study and all profitable exercises; here provision 
hhad been made alike for the classics and for science, for physical and for mental train- 
ing; here, indeed, was exemplified on a grand scale what ought to be and what is 
rapidly becoming a feature of our public schools of secondary grade, namely, the adapta- 
tion of material appliances to ideal results, of educational theory to living issues. 
With few exceptions the schools included in Tables VI and VII represent what the 
English aptly call ‘‘voluntary schools,” i. e., those originating with people acting in 
their private or individual capacity and not as a body politic. Above 50 per cent. of all 
the scholars of secondary grade in the United States are enrolled in the schools reported 
in Table VI. Asa rule these schools are less progressive than the public high schools, 
and such of them as depend solely upon tuition fees are apt to decline as public schools 
improve. Of the total number 42 per cent. are reported under the auspices of religious 
denominations, while a number tabulated as non-sectarian have some church affiliation. 
Intolerant séctarianism has had very little survival in these schools, and it is evident that 
they command patronage mainly on other than denominational grounds. They are gen- 
erally controlled by a board of trustees appointed with some reference to their fitness for 
educational affairs and their ability to afford a trustworthy guarantee of the character 
of the school. They will always be an important factor in the progress of Christian com- 
munities, and it is gratifying to observe that the several denominations in the United 
States are moving for the larger endowment and more efficient conduct of the secondary 
schools under their patronage.

    SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. ' OXLI 
Preparatory schools, Table VII, are located chiefly in the Middle and New England 
States, in which section secondary education, as distinct from elementary and collegiate, 
is most completely organized. The preparatories include a number of endowed academies 
which justly rank among the most noted institutions of the country. They have ample 
resources and are admirably furnished as regards teachers and material appliances, and 
they have preserved to us from our earliest history a conception of secondary instruction 
which is among the most precious of our inheritances from the past. 
The act of incorporation of Phillips Academy at Andover, dated October 4, 1780, sets 
forth the purposes of the institution as follows: ‘‘For promoting true piety and virtue, 
and for the education of youth in the English, Latin, and Greek languages, together 
with writing, arithmetic, music, and the art of speaking; also, practical geometry, logic, 
and geography, and such other of the liberal arts and sciences or languages as opportunity 
may hereafter permit and as.the trustees hereinafter provided shall direct.’’ The con- 
stitution of the academy includes among the subjects in which the students are to be in- 
structed ‘‘the great end and real business of living.” 
‘The founder of Phillips Exeter in defining the duties of the instructors says: ‘‘Above 
all, it is expected that the attention of instructors to the disposition of the minds and 
morals of the youth under their charge will exceed every other care, well considering 
that, though goodness without knowledge is weak and feeble, yet knowledge without 
goodness is dangerous, and that both united form the noblest character and laythe surest 
foundation of usefulness to mankind.’’ In another place he says again: ‘‘And in order 
to prevent a perversion of the true intent of this foundation, it is again declared that 
the first and principal design of this institution is the promoting of virtue and true piety, 
useful knowledge being subordinate thereto.” 
In this spirit our secondary schools must be maintained, eapeciall those which are 
likely to draw patronage from the most prosperous families, if we would not have our . 
“wealth outstrip our civilization.” 
The consideration of particular institutions and localities gives a more favorable im- 
pression of our secondary education than the survey of the whole country. In this 
broader view it seems that the interests of education in our midst could not be better 
served than by an investigation of this class of schools, conducted under the united 
authority of all the agents concerned in their maintenance. The particulars to which 
inquiry should be directed are the cost of the service, qualification of the teachers, 
personnel of the scholars, curricula, and results. 
The tables afford much information on these points, but it is incomplete, and in the 
case of the high schools involved with the statisties of other public schools. The total 
number of institutions in Tables VI and VII is 1,466, having 7,360 instructors and 135,892 
scholars. The total amount of productive funds in the possession of these institutions 
is $11,454,915, yielding an income of $1,042,073. The receipts from tuition fees during 
the year were $2,216,681. The price of tuition varies greatly in the different schools 
and affords no certain criterion of efficiency. Where there are no endowments low 
charges may be regarded as the indication of feebleness, but the reverse cannot be affirmed. * 
The total receipts, averaged upon the total attendance, give a per capita expense of $16; 
if the income from productive funds be included, the per capita is $24. It is unnecessary 
to suggest that the sum does not represent a fair equivalent for the result proposed. 
The inference is plain: a prosperous people like our own ought to make larger invest- 
ments in this department. Itis inevitable that a larger number of students should enter 
upon and complete a course of secondary training than a higher collegiate course; for 
1881 the number of students in the schools of Tables VI and VII is four times the num- 
ber of students reported in the institutions comprised in Table IX. The total number 
of students under secondary instruction is above three times the number in all classes 
of institutions for superior instruction, not including students in preparatory depart- 
ments; nevertheless it will be observed that the resources of the superior institutions
-P-A-G-E-142
  
  CXLII ‘REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
greatly exceed those of the secondary schools. Thus the value of grounds, buildings, 
and apparatus for secondary and preparatory schools, Tables VI and VII, is $24,813,687; 
for universities and colleges, Table IX, $40,255,976; the amount of productive funds 
for the former is $11,454,915, yielding an annual income of $1,042,073; for the latter, 
$48,786,877, yielding an annual income of $2,618,008. 
Considering the diffusion of secondary training and its absolute importance, this is a 
matter to which the patrons and benefactors of learning may well turn their attention. 
It is important that the qualification of teachers and the curricula of secondary schools 
should correspond to some rational system of training. Here we have much to learn 
from European nations, in which secondary education is better organized and adjusted 
more skilfully to the requirements of highly civilized and populous communities than 
inour own country. The courses of study must be as various as the purposes for which 
they are intended, and these in turn must be regulated by the classes into which the 
scholars may be grouped. I use the expression advisedly, for wherever the subject has 
been examined a classification of scholars has been recognized which seems to result 
from the natural order of life in modern society. The classification is not determined 
by ‘‘hard and fast lines’? and is not the same in all countries. For the United States 
it is substantially as follows: 
First. Scholars who may pursue the secondary course for about two years. 
Second. Those who may complete a course of four or six years, but who desire atabout 
16 years of age to pursue studies related to their prospective vocations. 
‘Third. Those for whom secondary training is a preparation for the college or univer- 
sity. The adjustment of courses of study to these distinct classes has -long engaged the 
thoughtful consideration of the educators and enlightened statesmen of foreign countries; 
superior primaries, Gymnasien, Realschulen, polytechnic schools, professional or trade 
schools, &c., indicate the drift of their deliberations. The keenness of international com- 
petition (in which we are becoming constantly more involved), the growth of our business 
interests, the development of superior instruction—i. e., that which occupies students 
up to 24 or 25 years of age—urge us to follow the example of European nations in the 
adaptation of secondary training. 
We are met at the outset of every such endeavor by the necessity fora fuller and 
more reliable presentation of the facts which must determine our adjustments. What 
is the proportion of scholars in each of the specified classes? What is the course which 
each pursues and with what results? 
The tables, as they stand, indicate how far we are from adequate information upon 
these points, while only those familiar with the work of the Office can appreciate the 
difficulties in the way of a more complete record. : 
From an examination of the statistical summary of classical and scientific preparatory 
courses two facts are made evident: (1) The majority of students in the schools pre- 
sented in Tables VI and VII are not preparing for superior institutions, only 7 per cent. 
of the scholars of the former being so reported and 34 per cent. of those of the latter. 
(2) A large proportion of this preparatory work is accomplished in the preparatory 
departments of colleges, universities, and schools of science. In other words, for the 
majority of their scholars the training of the secondary and preparatory schools is final. 
The importance of a reliable estimate of the number of students preparing for college 
and the number who annually present themselves for the college entrance examinations 
will be readily recognized. With a view to securing this information I have from year 
to year sent out inquiries, the returns to which are embodied in the summaries of col- 
lege entrance examinations and of students in classical and scientific preparatory courses, 
Table IX. - These returns, it will be seen, are as yet too fragmentary for any general in- 
ference. They are given merely to illustrate what is required as a means of estimating 
the results of that department of secondary training which is professedly preparatory

for college. The demand for such information is increasing. Fach institution seeks to 
know what others of the same grade are accomplishing, and those who meet for the gen- 
eral discussion of education realize the fatuity of counsels not based upon a knowledge of 
facts. In view of these manifestations I can but hope that the time is not distant when 
the teachers and officers of secondary schools will agree upon such a representation of 
the conditions of their work as the public interests demand.

In all the leading nations of Europe, Germany excepted, collegiate or, as itis termed, 
higher education for women is a subject of special attention and effort. In a few 
European countries the movement has reference to some specific end to be accomplished 
and signifies nothing outside of that limit. In others it arises from a deep conviction 
that the best interests of society suffer from the difference which exists between the * 
education of men and women. All that the advocates of higher education for women 
claim upon the ground of her capacity for development has been conceded in the 
United States, as appears from the establishment and endowment of colleges for women 
in which the same course of studies is pursued as in colleges for men, the experiment of 
the Harvard annex, and the practice of coeducation on the part of some of the leading in- 
stitutions of the country. 
In Europe as in the United States the chief point (i. e., woman’s capacity) has been 
conceded. Two important questions growing out of this concession are at present widely 
discussed, namely: Should higher education for woman conform in all respects to that 
which is deemed best for man? Is coeducation practicable or desirable? 
In the discussion of these questions the experience of the United States is constantly 
referred to as being of longer duration and more complete than that of any other nation. 
The attention thus directed to our country gives a reason for full and accurate reports 
* from all institutions engaged in the work. A stronger reason is found in the importance 
of the record in forming a just estimate of our social progress. Universal elementary 
education is essential in a republic; liberal education is an evidence and an index of those 
ideal conditions which are the ultimate end of good government and of public virtue 
and intelligence. 
The schools reported in Table VIII are, it will be observed, e&clusively for women; 
they numbered 226 in 1881, with 2,211 instructors and 26,041 pupils. To these should 
» be added five colleges for women in the State of New York,! which, on account of their 
telations‘to the University of the State, are reported in Table LX, making a total of 231 
superior schools for women tabulated in my report, enrolling about 27,000 students. 
A glance at Table VIII, appendix, will serve to indicate the varied character of the 
institutions here presented. With few exceptions they are conducted under the atspices 
of religious denominations and are an evidence of that zeal for education which has

Female College, New York; and Vassar College, Poughkeepsie.  
-P-A-G-E-151
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. CLI 
  been characteristic of the church no less in Protestant than in Catholic countries. The 
relation of the schools to the religious denominations has placed them among the great 
moral influences of the country, and probably in the past they have contributed more 
to the maintenance of morals and the development of character than to intellectual 
activity or the mastery of the severer branches of knowledge. 
A few of the schools report themselves as wholly engaged in preparatory work and a 
large number as chiefly so engaged. The number of students in the preparatory depart- 
ments is 7,016, about 26 per cent. of the whole number. All of the schools include a col- 
legiate department in their prospectus, in which the course of study is determined by that 
which custom approves for the degree of B. A. It is variously modified in the different 
schools, but probably not more so than in the colleges for young men reported in Table 
IX. Out of a total of 26,041 scholars in Table VIII, it will be observed that 10,945 are 
reported in the regular college course. Tuition fees, as will be seen by reference to the 
corresponding table, appendix, range from $10 to $200 per annum, averaging a little less 
than those’ reported in Table IX. The schools generally have a boarding department, 
_and it is thé price of living and the charge for extras, viz, music, drawing, language, &c., 
that make up the’heavy expense of which complaint is frequently made. 
A large proportion of the institutions possess grounds and buildings, the total valua- 
tion under this head being $10,047,159. Few have any income from productive funds, 
in which respect and in the very general absence of appliances, such as libraries, labora- 
tories, museums, &c., they do their work under much greater disadvantage than the 
institutions in Table IX. It will be seen that the total or productive funds reported in 
Table VIII is less than the funds of several single institutions in TableIX. The receipts 
from tuition fees for the year were $858,119 as against $2,080,450 received in the insti- 
tutions reported in Table IX. 
The record here presented affords some important general conclusions with reference 
to the education of women. It indicates a preference for separate collegiate education 
on the part of a large and influential class of our people. It indicates also a different 
conception of education as applied to women from that which obtains in the case of men. 
This difference, however, does not seem to conform to any’ recognized difference in ca- 
pacity or probable vocation; it is rather the lingering evidence of a disposition to treat 
woman’s education as a matter of little moment. It is an incongruity, not an adjust- 
ment. 
A few of the schools under consideration, as Vassar, Smith, and Wellesley, owe their 
establishment to that movement for the superior education of women which has char- 
acterized the last twenty years. They have endowments, require examination for 
admission, and maintain high standards of scholarship. If, in the nature of things, 
liberal education for women should differ in kind or in processes from that which is 
judged best for men, it might be supposed that the fact would be made evident in these 
institutions, untrammelled as they are by traditions, pledges, prejudices, or acquired 
tendencies. It is a little difficult to get at all the facts that bear upon the general con- 
clusion, butit may be assumed that when these are ¢ollated and compared with the like 
data from coeducation colleges we shall have great enlightenment with reference to the 
important and interesting question of liberal education for woman. 
Coeducation is the policy pursued in a number of the institutions represented in Table 
TX and in the majority of those founded upon the land grant of 1862, represented in 
Table X. The number of women reported in the former is as follows: preparatory de- 
partment, 7,009; collegiate department, classical course, 1,827, and scientific course, 1,295. 
The latter make no distinction of sex in reporting the collegiate departments; in the 
preparatory department they report 290. Information received in this Office from oo of 
the institutions gives them a total of 1,278 women students. 
The experience of these institutions shows that coeducation is entirely practicable 
under their management, and it is recommended by their officers upon considerations of 
economy, its agreement with the conditions of family life, and its practical results.

cLIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  In the United States, as in Great Britain and France, the movement for the higher 
education of woman has been greatly stimulated by the demand for her services as teacher. 
This influence has been particularly felt in the direction of science. The number of 
women enrolled in science classes increases slightly from year to year as does the provision 
for their instruction in this department. At the request of the Women’s Education As- 
sociation of Boston and with their generous codperation, special laboratories have been 
provided for the instruction of women in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As 
set forth in the report, ‘‘the design is to afford them facilities for the study of chemical 
analysis, industrial chemistry, mineralogy, and biology. The instruction is arranged 
for such students as may be able to devote their whole time to the work, as well as for 
those who, by reason of other engagements, can spend only a few hours a week in these 
exercises.” 
No progress has been made since my last report with reference to the admission of 
women to Harvard or to Columbia College. The effort to affect the policy of these insti- 
tutions is not prompted, as sometimes represented, by the desire to secure for women 
the best possible collegiate training. This is already accomplished by the admission of 
women to a number of colleges whose equality with those mentioned, in respect to train- 
ing for the B. A. degree, is not a matter of question. The constant pressure brought to 
bear upon our oldest and richest institutions with reference to the education of women 
is due to two causes: First, the conviction entertained by many of the most thought- 
ful men and women that separate education has no reason in the nature of things and 
is opposed to the best interests of society; second, to the fact that the institutions speci- 
fied, by reason of their large endowments and accumulated resources, promise more rapid 
development upon the university side than is possible to other institutions, and their 
exclusiveness debars women from the provision for the extended and specialized train- 
ing which is only possible under university conditions. 
It will be remembered that for several successive years, in his annual reports, Dr. F. 
A. P. Barnard, president of Columbia College, has urged the admission of women to 
that institution. In his current report he says : 
The time seems, therefore, to have fully come when Columbia College should feel 
herself urged by every motive of expediency or duty to do her part in carrying forward 
this noble and beneficent work. 
He concludes his argument as follows : 
In conclusion on this subject, the undersigned can only repeat the conviction expressed 
in his former report, that the question here considered is in this institution only a ques- 
tion of time; and that, whatever may happen this year or the next, Columbia College 
will yet open her doors widely enough to receive all earnest and honest seekers after 
knowledge, without any distinction of class or sex. 
Numberless enterprises for the progress or amelioration of society are due to the habit 
of action and the community of feeling resulting from the associated effort which is a 
condition of collegiate education. In the case of women this result is not wanting and 
promises the most valuable return for the investment made in the provision for their 
higher education. One of its most interesting illustrations is the action of the associa- 
tion of college alumnz with reference to physical education, asset forth in the prospectus 
of the Association of Collegiate Alumne. :

The statistics of colleges and universities show slight losses at a few points and mod- 
erate gains at others. Colleges and students are fewer this year than last. Theincome 
from productive funds has diminished, but the resources of colleges have increased. They 
have more property at their disposal and a larger force of teachers. Here and there an 
institution has enlarged its courses or given to them greater flexibility or closer adapta-
-P-A-G-E-161

tion to public needs. Some additional institutions have adopted the practice of admit- 
ting without examination the graduates of approved high schools. Other institutions 
have held examinations for admission in distant cities where they have not been held be- 
fore. Several State universities have received public appropriations sufficient to insure 
them against immediate necessity and, in some cases, to provide for future needs. In- 
centives to study have been increased by additional prizes and fellowships. More strin- 
gent rules relative to conferring degrees have occasionally been adopted. The conduct 
of students has reseived many favorable notices and internal dissensions have not pre- 
vailed to any great degree. 
COLLEGE HYGIENE.   
Prof. Edward Hitchcock, M. p., of Amherst College, Mass., has issued a report on his 
twenty years’ experience in the department of physical education and hygiene in that 
institution. Heavy gymnastics are not commended by him to the mass of students. 
Dumb bells weighing about a pound each are approved, and exercise with them is taken 
for 20 or 30 minutes each afternoon, toward the evening. This has been found the most 
practicable time. Reliance is not placed on exercise alone for maintaining health. At- 
tention is paid to cleanliness, care of the digestive organs, relaxation from mental effort, 
&e. Athletic sports are encouraged, but not unduly stimulated. The average develop- 
ment and health of students during their course have been satisfactory. The increase 
of height from freshman to senior year has been from 67.33 to 67.94 inches; of weight, 
from 133 to 142 pounds; of chest girth, from 34.76 to 35.97 inches; and of lung capacity, 
from 233 to 251 cubic inches. The diseases incident to students are principally colds, 
pneumonia, and throat difficulties. About 40 per cent. of sickness arises from these 
causes, 9 per cent. from physical injuries, 5 per cent. from febrile complaints, and 
nearly as much from weak and sore eyes. The average time lost by students on ac- 
count of sickness has been 2.65 days yearly. Instruction in anatomy, physiology, and ~ 
hygiene is given in freshmanand sophomore years. 
GROWTH OF YALE COLLEGE. 
The president of Yale College has this year issued the first of a proposed series of reports 
on the progress of that institution and the changes within it. Once in five years a simi- 
lar report will be presented to the alumni and distributed to the public. This one covers 
15 years. During this period the officers of government and instruction in all the depart- 
ments have increased from 49 to 108; the students, from 682 to 1,037. The academic 
staff has increased from 12 professors and 8 tutors to 22 professors and 9 tutors. The 
graduate department has increased from a single professor and 4 or 5 students to 6 pro- 
fessors and 29 students. The college library has 102,000 volumes against 46,000 in 
1865-’66. The Peabody museum has been provided and is made of great service in the 
study of natural history and kindred sciences. Eight buildings have been erected and 
$70,000 have been expended in permanent improvements. The aggregate addition to the 
wealth of the college is more than $2,500,000. Of instruction in the academical depart- 
ment President Porter says: 
The three lower classes are taught in smaller divisions and the divisions themselves 
are graded according to scholarship. In the junior and senior classes arrangements for 
optional studies in the afternoon have been matured and a liberal variety of such studies 
is offered, and as much time has been allotted to the optional system as, in our opinion, 
is practicable or desirable. The optional studies are assigned to the afternoon, four in 
each week, and are so arranged as to provide for continuous study for from one to several 
terms in all the principal departments of science and letters.     
  ELECTIVE SYSTEMS, 
Elective systems of instruction in colleges have been increasing in favor and have been 
adopted or extended by several institutions within a few years. Sufficient time has 
elapsed to warrant inquiry as to results. Theories have been tested practically, and the

advantages and disadvantages of allowing students a choice of studies have been weighed 
against each other in college halls under the eyes of vigilant observers, whose tes- 
timony may be accepted as strong evidence of the appropriateness and value of the 
elective system. One of the most prominent objections was that students would elect 
studies requiring the least effort. This has not been found a common practice. In 
Columbia College, New York City — 
The great body of young men in college are really interested in study. They appre- 
ciate the value of t opportunities and are earnestly desirous to improve them to the 
best advantage. They select their studies, when free to do so, with an intuitive recog- 
nition of those which they are most capable of mastering, and from which therefore they 
are conscious that they will derive the greatest profit. 
Dr. A. P. Peabody, some time ago, said of the manner in which the power of choice 
was exercised at Harvard College : 
I think that at first there was in the choice of studies a good deal of caprice, wanton- 
ness, and haphazard; but with every year the choice has become more and more a seri- 
ous matter, a subject of careful forethought and forecast, insomuch that there are some 
of our late freshman class who have, with suitable advice, drawn up written schemes, 
and very judicious ones, of a course of study extending through the remaining three 
years. 
The choice of subjects made by students freely exercising their taste and judgment 
bears out the opinions presented and shows a sufficient adherence proportionately to 
the studies usually constituting college curricula. The number of courses of instruction 
in the principal departments of collegiate study in Michigan University and the number 
of students in them present at examination were reported last year. In history there 
were 11 courses, 582 students; in Latin, 13 courses, 527 students; Greek, 13 courses, 413 
students; German, 7 courses, 381 students; French, 8 courses, 315 students; English, 
10 courses, 409 students; philosophy, 4 courses, 195 students; mathematics, 11 courses, 
339 students; chemistry, 13 courses, 162 students; physics, 6 courses, 113 students; 
zodlogy, 6 courses, 117 students; geology, 9 courses, 73 students. Many other depart- 
ments were represented by fewer courses and students. Those mentioned show the 
prominence of English and linguistic studies. At Johns Hopkins University, 1880-’81, 
the number of students in attendance on courses in mathematics was 31; physics, 35; 
chemistry, 40; biology; 25; Greek, 31; Latin, 40; German, 55; French, Italian, &c., 
33; English, 29; history, 40. ‘‘In Harvard College,’’ says Prof. Charles F. Dunbar, 
“it does not appear that the tendency of the elective system has been to develop abnor- 
mally any particular class of studies.’’ Classical literature has received slightly less 
attention. Modern languages have maintained their ground. History has gaiped 
heavily. Mathematics remains singularly constant. Physics, chemistry, and natural 
history attract a slightly increasing number of students. In Columbia College, the 
inferences drawn from a tabular statement of elective work during junior end senior 
years by President F. A. P. Barnard are as follows: 
It appears from the foregoing that the ancient languages are chosen by a larger propor- 
tion of the class during the junior than during the senior year; that this proportion for 
Greek is more than two-thirds in the junior and about one-half during the senior year; 
for Latin it is five-sixths during the junior and a little less than one-half during the 
senior; also, that mathematics is chosen by more than three-fourths of the juniors and by 
only about one-fifth of the seniors. ‘The small number in this latter class is accounted 
for by the fact that the mathematics of the senior year is the differential and integral 
calculus, which is only selected by those who have a special aptitude for this class of 
studies. Physics is a favorite study in both years and was chosen in the year under 
consideration by nearly the entire number in each class. Of the modern languages, 
French and German are selected by about a third of the juniors and by about one in 
eight or ten of the seniors; Italian comes next, and Spanish is the choice of the smallest 
number. Botany, which was not offered at the beginning of the year, was chosen only 
by nine juniors. 
Of the studies which are elective in the senior year only, geology was, during the year 
nding June, 1881, ed by every member of the class and astronomy by all but one; 
wbout three-fifths selected chemistry, two-fifths philosophy, and one-fifth political 
economy. Logic, history, and English literature do not appear in the above lists, as 
these studies are obligatory on all students.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. CLXIIL 
  The effect of the elective system on scholarship has been excellent. The studies 
selected are in harmony with the tastes and proclivities of the students and are pursued 
with interest and satisfaction. A transition from prescribed to elected studies is accom- 
panied by an improvement in marks. But as some students are not conscious of their 
unfitness for certain studies and their fitness for others it is suggested that instructors, 
who have become familiar with the mental qualities and inclinations of pupils, both in 
preparatory schools and during the period of fixed studies, should be consulted in the 
preparation of a scheme of elective studies. 
The general results of the elective system at Harvard College are summed up by 
President Eliot in a review of the annual report of the dean of the faculty, as follows : 
It is to be inferred from his account of the actual experience of the college during a 
period of ten years that the system does not tend to bring about the extinction of the 
traditional studies called liberal; because these studies, though pursued by a smaller 
proportion of students than formerly, are pursued by those who choose them with greater 
vigor and to better purpose than they were ever pursued as parts of a prescribed curric- 
ulum. The tables of the dean’s report also indicate that the scientific turn of mind is 
comparatively rare among the young men who enter the college, a large majority of the 
students preferring languages, metaphysics, history, and political science to mathemat- 
ies, physics, zodlogy, and botany. Whether this preference is the result of genuine nat- 
ural predisposition or an effect of the training supplied by the secondary schools it would 
be hard to determine. Finally, whoever reads the history of the development of the 
elective system as it is recorded in the successive annual reports of the dean of the col- 
lege faculty since 1870 will arrive at the well grounded conviction that every extension _ 
of the system has been a gain to the individual student, to the college, and to every in- 
terest of education and learning, and will also see reason to believe that the time is not 
ay sistant when the few subjects still prescribed for all students will in their turn become 
elective. 
VARIATIONS IN COLLEGE ATTENDANCE. 
The statistics of the colleges and universities of the country show the number of stu- 
dents in their collegiate departments to be 32,459. The ratio between the number of 
students and the entire population, whether in the whole country or in the individual 
States or in groups of States, has much significance and interest. Schools of science 
form a distinct class of schools, and therefore may be omitted in the consideration of 
this question, though they have courses of study as advanced as those commonly pur- 
sued in colleges and often nearly identical with the scientific courses of classical insti- 
tutions. The influence of students and graduates of scientific and classical schools is 
not greatly different, socially or politically. The mental discipline and the acquisitions 
of the two classes fit them for responsibilities equally burdensome and important. If 
the frequency with which young people are availing themselves of opportunities for 
gaining higher education would be ascertained definitely, schools of science and insti- 
tutions for the higher instruction of women should be taken into account. But many 
indications may be obtained from approximate figures relating to the relative attendance 
of youth in distinctly collegiate institutions in different sections of the country. 
There is in the United States 1 college student to 1,545 inhabitants. The number of 
inhabitants of a State for each student attending college within it varies greatly. Con- 
necticut has 655 inhabitants for each student in its colleges; Tennessee and Maryland, 
about 800; Massachusetts, a little less than a thousand; California, a little more. At 
the other end of the list are Vermont and several of the States in the Southwest, which 
have more than three thousand inhabitants to a student in their own colleges. These 
figures do not represent the number of students from any particular State pursuing col- 
legiate studies. They are approximately correct for the larger States South and West; 
they are entirely misleading when applied to New England. Comparatively few per- 
sons are found in southern colleges who reside out of the State, except in the cases of 
noted universities and of colleges located near the State boundary. The same is, toa 
smaller extent, true in the West. e 
In New England there are 1,034 inhabitants for each student in the colleges of its six 
States and 1,526 inhabitants for each resident of New England in its colleges. Maine 
has 1 student in college in New England for each 1,310 inhabitants; New Hampshire,
-P-A-G-E-164

1 for 1,983; Vermont, 1 for 1,477; Massachusetts, 1 for 1,393; Rhode Island, 1 for 
2,049 ; and Connecticut, 1 for 1,946. Thus Vermont, which has only 1 student in its 
colleges for every 3,000 inhabitants, has more students according to its population than 
Connecticut, though the latter State has one student in its colleges for every 655 inhab- 
itants. Reasons for this are apparent. One of them may be discussed here, since it 
largely determines whether there will be more students from a State or ina State. It 
is the presence of well known and richly endowed colleges. The colleges of Vermont 
are small and limited in means. Just beyond the boundary of the State are Dartmouth 
and Williams. The former has 47 Vermont students; the latter, 14. Amherst College 
is but little more distant and has 12. Harvard and Yale are near enough to attract 
several. More than one-half of Vermont’s students are in colleges outside of the State. 
The condition of affairs is quite different in Connecticut. Her students are largely in 
herown institutions. Other States send thither their sons: Maine, 30; New Hampshire, 
13; Vermont, 10; Massachusetts, 65; New York, 200; New Jersey, 30; Pennsylvania, 
90; and the States of the West are well represented. 
It does not appear that the proportion of college students is so much smaller in the 
older Southern States east of the Mississippi than in New England as many would sup- 
pose. One student for 1,700 inhabitants is not far from a justaverage. A much smaller 
proportion is reported as in their colleges. But the same inequality exists here as in the 
States above mentioned. For instance, South Carolina has reported only one student to 
3,270 inhabitants. Had every one of its colleges reported, it would have shown a larger 
proportion of students. A further increase must be made, not only because the State 
does not educate all its students, but also because almost no students from outside attend 
its colleges. There are as many students from South Carolina in Yale and Harvard as 
there are collegiate students in South Carolina from other States, so far as can be ascer- 
tained by the catalogues of the colleges of that State for the present year possessed by 
the Office, and nearly all are in its files. The case of Tennessee is different. It has 
a large student population from other States. Vanderbilt University alone has nearly 
400 such students. In 1880 it registered 31 from Texas, 38 from Kentucky, 35 from 
Alabama, 14 from Georgia, 7 from Louisiana, 4 from South Carolina, 19 from Arkansas, 
23 from Mississippi, and asmall number from nearly every one of the Southern and Cen- 
tral States. 
It would seem that there has been an increase not only in the absolute number, but 
also in the relative proportion of college students during the last fifty years; but it is 
essential to bear in mind that the facilities for gathering such statistics available half a 
century ago were far inferior to those existing at present. Then 44 institutions reported 
4,021 students. (At least 13 other colleges existed. If their attendance was on the aver- | 
age the same as that of the 44 reporting, the entire number of students may be esti- 
mated at 5,200, about one-sixth of the present number. The population then was a 
little more than one-fourth as large as in.1880. The establishing of colleges north of the 
Ohio had only commenced. Five of the 36 colleges in Ohio, 1 of the 15 in Indiana, and 
1 of the 28 in Mlinois had been founded and in them were gathering small knots of stu- 
dents around the few energetic men that were the soul of these ventures. South of the 
Ohio River and Pennsylvania and east of the Mississippi 25 colleges, with 1,229 students, 
were reported in the spring of 1831 to the American Quarterly Register, where now 
there are 92 colleges, with 7,757 students. Then there was 1 student to about 4,000 in- 
habitants. North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee fell below this average. Now North 
Carolina and Tennessee have more students relatively than the average of Southern 
States. Virginia and South Carolina have proportionately fewer now than fifty years 
ago. 
In New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania there was 1 student for 3,430 inhabi- 
@ants in 1830; now there is 1 for 1,577 inhabitants. Then New York had comparatively 
the fewest students in college; now ithas the most. Its 4 colleges have multiplied to 27. 
Union College, then far ahead iu point of numbers, has been outstripped by two of the 
colleges of New York City. In New Jersey students have increased, slightly more rap-

idly than the population; and Princeton College has passed by Rutgers. Pennsylvania’s 
student population has increased from 1 in 3,100 to 1 in 1,745. Some of the colleges 
then flourishing have no longer an individual existence. Others have been founded, 
so that there are 20 more now than in 1830. 
The college population of New England has increased from 1 in 1,281 to 1 in 1,034. 
That of Vermont is absolutely smaller than fifty years ago; and that of Rhode Island is 
relatively so. In Maine it has increased from 1 in 2,194 to 1 in 1,500; in New Hamp- 
shire, from 1 in 1,760 to 1 in 1,400; in Massachusetts, from 1 in 1,108 to 1 in 940; and 
in Connecticut, from 1 in 727 to 1 in 655. In none of the States is there so large a part 
of the entire number of persons in college from the State attending within the State as 
in 1830. This is emphatically true of New Hampshire and Vermont. Fifty years ago 
most of the young men of Maine, Rhode Island, and Connecticut were educated in their 
own States, as they are at present. 
President Porter, of Yale College, says: ‘‘ The liberal education which the colleges have 
uniformly proposed to give is none other than what Milton calls the ‘complete and gen- 
erous education’ that ‘fits a man to perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously all 
the offices, both private and public, of peace and war.’’’ This being done, the increased 
college attendance is a pleasing feature of educational progress. "That the tendency of 
students to pass beyond State limits in seeking higher education is praiseworthy is the 
opinion of President Eliot, of Harvard. In a recent report he said: 
The segregation, within State limits or any other narrow bounds, of the young men 
receiving university instruction would be a grave calamity for the United States; for the 
association and education in common of young men taken from all parts of the country 
is one of the strongest of national bonds. It is much to be wished that universities may 
grow up in the Western and Southern States, as well as in the Eastern, strong enough to 
attract students from all parts of the country, and that the German practice of migrat- 
ing from one university to another may take root here. 
SCHOOLS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE. 
Political science should be taught in colleges because it directs the attention of the 
student to important truths and instructs him in principles of government viewed from 
the standpoint not of the politician, but of the scholar. Most colleges recognize its 
claims and give one or two terms of senior year to constitutional and international law 
and political economy. The introduction of elective and graduate courses has given 
students larger opportunities to pursue the study advantageously. A few leading uni- 
versities have established courses in which the distinctive studies are history, social science, 
political economy, and law. Columbia College, New York City, and the University of 
Michigan, Ann Arbor, have recently added schools of political science to those already 
in operation. The objects of these new departments are best stated by quotations from - 
the publications of the two institutions. The Columbia College Handbook of Informa- 
tion says: 
The purpose of the school is to give a complete general view of all the subjects both 
of internal and external public polity, from the threefold standpoint of history, law, and 
philosophy. Its prime aim is therefore the development of all the branches of the polit- 
ical sciences. Its secondary aim is the preparation of young men for all the political 
branches of the public service. 
Acting President Henry S. Frieze, of the University of Michigan, uses the following 
words in reporting the organization of a school of political science: 
It aims to give its students a large and thorough preparation for the duties that will 
devolve upon them as citizens and members of society. It opens to them a wide range 
of history, wherein they may learn to estimate aright the conditions either of social 
good or social evil, the conditions of national prosperity or of national ruin. The 
courses offered to them in jurisprudence, in constitutional law and history, in legislative 
and parliamentary forms, and inadministrative methods and usages are designed to fit 
them for those public duties to which every citizen is liable to be called. There are 
also studies in political economy and international law and studies in sanitary science, 
all combining with the rest to make up a course of advanced and practical education 
which can hardly fail to make of those who pursue it to the end intelligent and useful 
citizens and members of society.

CLXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The requirement for admission to the School of Political Science, Columbia College, 
is the successful completion of the regular course of undergraduate study in that college 
or in some other maintaining an equivalent curriculum of study to the end of the junior 
year. One year less of preparatory study is required at Michigan University, and those 
that have gone forward to graduation in a reputable college are credited with so much 
of the work of the school as they may have completed during their course. 
The studies of the Columbia College School are arranged in asingle course three years 
in length. ‘Those of the first year are chiefly historical. The development of natural 
sciences, philosophy, national politics, and constitutions is considered with studies in 
geography and ethnography. Land tenure, taxation, and finance are the branches of 
political economy under discussion. The studies of the second year are in Roman and 
constitutional law; those of the third include diplomacy, international and administra- 
tive law, and social science. The studies of the Michigan University school are embraced 
under the four heads of history, political economy, sanitary science, and rights. Eng- 
lish history has a prominent place in the historical department. Courses of instruction 
are also given in the general history of continental Europe, the political history of the 
American colonies, and the constitutional history of the United States. There are ele- 
mentary and advanced courses in political economy. The former is theoretical; the 
latter concerned with practical questions, such as commercial crises, transportation, migra- 
tion, free trade and protection, and social reforms. Sanitary science includes chemical 
biology, foods, water and air supply, heating and light, ferments and germs, health 
laws, &e. 
The completion of one year of the course in the school at Columbia College entitles 
the student to the degree of bachelor of philosophy; of the entire course, to that of 
doctor of philosophy. The securing of a degree in the Michigan University depends on 
the satisfactory completion of a prescribed amount of study. An examination for 
bachelor’s or master’s degree may be undergone at the close of two years’ special work. 
Those that obtain a master’s degree with distinction may present themselves for a 
doctor’s degree at the expiration of another year; others may do so any time after two 
years. The degrees are in philosophy, in science, or in letters. 
The Wharton School of Finance and Economy in the University of Pennsylvania 
may be mentioned in this connection, although its aim is to prepare for business 
rather than public life. Its special studies commence with junior year and continue 
three years, as do the scientific courses of the university. Students who have passed 
through the freshman and sophomore classes of either the classical or scientific depart- 
ment of the university are admitted without examination ; all others are examined in 
. subjects similar to those pursued in one or the other of these departments during the 
first two years. The prominent studies of the school are French, German, natural 
sciences, social science, political economy, and general law. The principal work of 
junior year is on questions of money, taxation, commerce, transportation, and labor. 
The degree conferred at the end of the course is bachelor of science.

  CLXX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  ‘The schools of science have not undergone great changes during the last year. ‘The 
number of institutions endowed with the national land grant remains the same and 
their faculties and students have neither diminished nor increased greatly. Gifts have 
been made to some of them, and thus they have been afforded better conveniences and 
an opportunity to widen the field of instruction and increase the teaching force. The 
newly established colleges of agriculture in Mississippi and South Carolina have been 
well attended and are meeting with eminent success. The list of schools of science not 
endowed with the national land grant has had a few additions. The Case School of 
Applied Science has been organized at Cleveland, Ohio. The design of its instruction 
is to give a thorough technical and professional training in the principles of natural and 
physical science, with their application’ to the arts. The course of study will be four 
years in length. One-half of the time will be spent in a careful study of mathematics, 
chemistry, physics, modern languages, and the methods of scientific research; the other 
half, in professional studies in some department of applied science. It is yet to be 
announced in what departments instruction will be afforded. The Ohio Mechanics’ 
Institute, Cincinnati, has taken a forward step during the year by organizing a department 
of science and arts. Its duties include publishing a quarterly journal of science, provid- 
ing annually a course of not less than six public lectures on topics of general interest 
within the scope of the department, holding monthly meetings for the transaction of 
business and the discussion of scientific questions, and inquiring into and reporting on 
new and presumably meritorious inventions. The department is divided into special 
sections for scientific work, each of which has an organization of its own. Sections of 
chemistry, mechanics, and engineering have been formed, and those of electricity and 
architecture are contemplated. The journal of the department contains ‘‘such of its 
proceedings, including reports on inventions, papers, and discussions of scientific interest, 
as may be deemed valuable to the public.’’ The consideration of new inventions is in- 
trusted to a committee of not less than five persons. Evidence of original invention, 
novelty, and usefulness is required. If the device or discovery seems worthy, the com- 
mittee may recommend the award. of the medal of the Ohio Mechanics’ Institute. The 
society is enjoying a vigorous life and promises to greatly enlarge its field of usefulness. 
A series of elaborate agricultural experiments has been undertaken at private expense 
at Houghton Farm, Orange County, N. Y. This estate was purchased five years ago by 
Mr. Lawson Valentine, of New York City. It was soon brought to a satisfactory con- 
dition as a residence, and then plans for experimental work were made. Dr. Manly 
Miles was employed as director, and laid out fields suitable for his purpose, supervised 
their systematic drainage, and visited the best known experimental stations of Europe. 
Actual work was commenced in the year 1880. Recently the enterprise has been divided 
into three distinct departments: the farm, the experiment work, and the residence. The 
intentions of the proprietor with reference to these departments are stated by him, as 
follows: 
(1) That the farming operations be carried on in accordance with the best known 
methods and under the best possible organization and management, with a view of edu- 
eating and enlightening others by furnishing valuable examples and results in practical 
agriculture. 
(2) That there be a scientific department devoted to agricultural investigation and 
experiment, and that such department be of the highest order, so as to command the 
respect, interest, and codperation of the leading scientific minds of this and other 
countries. 
(3) That Houghton Farm be a comfortable, healthful, and attractive home for the 
family of its proprietor and afford large hospitality for friends and guests. 
€ PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY. 
During the year a circular on chemistry and physics, edited by Prof. F. W. Clarke, 
B. S., has been widely distributed. It contains a comprehensive view of instruction 
in these subjects, given in various classes of schools, and was introduced by general re-
-P-A-G-E-171

marks on the increase of science teaching, the methods of instruction, laboratories, 
original research, &c. The report was well received and promises to aid in promoting 
the study of these sciences, which contribute so much to the solution of industrial 
problems and to the right understanding of familiar operations and phenomena. 
Examples of the practical uses to which the principles of each department of physics 
are applied readily suggest themselves. 
The author of a handbook of the Kansas State Agricultural College, issued during 
the time when Hon. J. A. Anderson, now a member of Congress, was president of the 
institution, says: 
In most of the arts and trades, a knowledge of some branch of physics or chemistry 
ranks next in usefulness to that of practical English and practical mathematics, and 
should be taught accordingly. Familiarity with the laws of light and skill in the 
manipulation of shades and colors have special worth to the painter, frescoer, engraver, 
and photographer. The mason, builder, and machinist should understand heat, as it 
acts upon air in the draught of flues and ventilation of houses or in the shrinking and 
warping of wood, or as it acts upon water, upheaving foundations, disintegrating rock, or 
furnishing the great motor, steam. Water itself, either as a driving power or as a solv- 
ing and cleansing agent, has an interest to the artisan equal to the use which he makes of it. 
Electricity has its special value to the operator, metallurgy to the worker in metals, 
economic geology and botany to the engineer. As numberless as the vats, laboratories, 
and furnaces of the industrial world are the combinations of physi¢s and chemistry. 
Mr. C. B. Stetson, a writer on technical education, speaking of the industrial value of 
a knowledge of chemistry, says: 
All those persons whose business it is to produce new combinations of matter—such as 
the farmer, miner, dyer, bleacher, founder, maker of machinery, and numerous others— 
should have a knowledge of chemistry. Without such knowledge, which is an essential 
element of skilled labor in these departments of industry, neither rude nor dexterous 
Jabor can produce satisfactory results. 
Such ideas of the importance of chemistry are of recent origin. A hundred years 
ago the students of medicine first undertook to apply the elements of this science which 
now is called upon by them with the utmost frequency. Within the present century 
only have professorships in colleges been generally established. The rapid spread of the 
study commenced after the period of brilliant chemical discoveries, which extended over 
a large part of the first half of this century. When, in 1862, Congress gave land for the 
promotion of the education of the people in the pursuits and professions of life, chemis- 
try had become recognized as a science touching human industry at many points and 
found a foothold in all the institutions aided by the national grant. Nearly one-fourth 
of them have courses designed particularly for the perfecting of students in chemical 
knowledge. Cornell University has a four years’ course in chemistry and physics; Rut- 
gers Scientific School, a short course exclusively for chemistry and a long course in 
chemistry and agriculture; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, three courses, 
four years in length. Other scientific colleges give similar prominence to this science, so 
that it may be said with truth that endowing schools for practical education by the Gov- 
ernment has been a powerful stimulus to the study of chemistry. Professor Clarke, in the 
circular whose publication has elicited these thoughts, speaks of the study of chemistry 
and physics in the schools of science as follows: 
The scientific schools differ from each other almost as widely as do the colleges. One, 
for example, is exclusively a school of engineering, in which chemistry and physics are 
-purely incidental studies.. Others devote especial attention to giving mechanical train- 
ing, to mining, or to chemical technology. In nearly all of them applied science, so 
called, is mainly cultivated, with inorganic and analytical chemistry and general physics 
as prominent objects of study. 
The mental discipline incident to the study of chemistry is of the highest kind, and 
entitles the science to a prominent place among the branches which make up advanced 
courses of study. This truth has been recognized by many collegiate institutions, both 
by giving the science increased attention in fixed courses and by placing it on an equality  
-P-A-G-E-172
  CLXXII_ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
with classical and mathematical studies in many instances.in which the elective system 
has been adopted. Original work in the laboratory merits the warmest commendation, 
asitemploysthe finest qualities of theintellect. Prof. Henry E. Roscoe has made a forcible 
presentation of the claims of original research at Owens College, Manchester, England, 
in which occur the following passages: 
In this ordinary course of laboratory work the hand is gradually trained to perform 
the various mechanical operations; the eye is at the same time taught to observe with 
care and the mind to draw the logical inferences from the phenomena observed. Habits 
of independent thought and ideas of free inquiry are thus at once inculcated; no author- 
ity besides that of the senses is appealed to, and no preconceived notions have to be 
obeyed; the student creates for himself his own material for observation, and draws his 
own conclusion therefrom. If he is inaccurate, either in his manipulation, his observa- 
tions, or in his conclusion, nature soon finds him out.    
INSTRUCTION IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. 
‘The multiplication of courses in mechanical engineering, the improvement of methods 
of instruction in this department, and the increase of appliances for practical work have 
been noticeable in schools of science during the present year, as well as in those imme- 
diately preceding. The term mechanical engineering is not easily defined. It may be 
described as the art of designing, constructing, and operating machinery, mill work, 
steam engines, and other machines. The ample remuneration for such work which man- 
ufacturers are willing to give and the popular conviction that our youth may be trained 
to fill places of usefulness and honorable profit in mills and factories to the advantage of 
themselves and the nation have originated and nourished the systematic study of all 
branches bearing upon mechanic arts. In the courses established, modern languages and 
literature have served to make students acquainted with engineering literature and able 
to express themselves with correctness and fluency. The sciences have unfolded the laws 
of natural forces underlying processes and existing in materials. Mathematics has given 
the rules of calculation; drawing, a skill of eye and hand; and shop practice, familiarity 
with actual labor accurately performed. How these and other subjects are embodied in 
the training of the mechanical engineer will appear incidentally in taking a brief view 
of instruction in this department. 
The friends of industrial science and practical education living in Eastern Massachu- 
setts were turning their thoughts as early as 1860 to the establishment of an institute 
of technology, in which the sciences allied to the occupations of the producing classes 
should be taught with special reference to their economic value. A school of mechani- 
cal engineering was not among those named in the original plan, but the course of study 
placed at the head of all in the first catalogue of the institute was in this subject. Its 
studies occupied the last two years of a four years’ course, and were embraced under 
the heads of analytic mechanics, applied mechanics, construction of machines, descrip- 
tive geometry, and general studies. 
While the Institute of Technology was being organized in Boston, gentlemen of wealth 
in the central part of the State became convinced of the need of a system of training 
boys for the duties of an active life ‘‘ broader and brighter than the popular method of 
learning a trade and more simple and direct than the so-called liberal education.”’ 
Through their beneficence the Worcester County Free Institute was founded and enabled 
to offer an education based on mathematics, living languages, physical sciences, and 
drawing, and a training for some mechanical pursuit. At the organization of the insti- 
tute (1868), algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and mechanics were included in 
the mathematical studies. French is the modern foreign language most studied. 
Chemistry was taken more or less throughout the course, while physics and geology re- 
ceived attention. Free hand drawing occupied ten hours a week junior year and two 
hours a week middle year; mechanical drawing, six hours a week during middle and 
senior years. A department of design received into it at the middle of junior year stu- 
dents who had exhibited aptness for drawing, and gave them instruction preparatory to
-P-A-G-E-173
  
INSTRUCTION IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. CLXXIIT 
fresco and ornamental painting and the designing of prints. The distinguishing feature 
of the institute was the method and amount of practice in a machine shop. The shop 
was a genuine factory, turning off marketable products and employing skilled mechanics 
for the direction of the students. Init each scholar was obliged to work a fixed num- 
ber of hours weekly. His advantages over a common apprentice consisted in the rapid 
advancement from drudgery to skilled labor, the careful distribution of time, constant 
tuition, and the discipline and culture of drawing and intellectual studies. The origi- 
nal plan has been adhered to substantially to the present time, the amount of drawing 
and shop practice having been slightly increased. Each student must commence work 
at 7 in the morning, daily. The training, it is claimed, omits no element necessary to 
an education in mechanics, and introduces chipping, filing, planing, sawing, milling, 
&c., in their relations to an actual machine or structure and under the stimulus of the 
business consequences of inferior workmanship. The course of practical work may be 
so modified as to give special fitness for either mechanical engineering, civil engineering, 
drawing, physics, or chemistry, students of mechanical engineering being required to 
serve an apprenticeship of six months previous to entering the regular three years’ 
course. 
In 1868, Edwin A. Stevens, esy., a wealthy citizen of Hoboken, N. J., bequeathed land 
anda large sum of money for the founding of an ‘‘ institution of learning.’’ The trustees 
to whom the disposition of the funds was given determined to establish a school 
of mechanical engineering and name it the Stevens Institute of Technology in honor 
of its founder. A single course of instruction was arranged. Mathematics, physics, 
mechanical drawing, chemistry and metallurgy, French and German, and literature 
were given places beside mechanical engineering. A faculty of young men was selected 
to aid in executing the plans of the trustees, and the new field was entered upon with 
enthusiasm. The institute has grown steadily. In 1875 a mechanical laboratory was 
established. In it engines, lubricants, building materials, and other structures and 
substances have been tested. The department of mechanical engineering instructs thor- 
oughly in the various branches of the subject and gives practice to familiarize the stu- 
dent with appliances, processes, and methods necessary to the construction of mechanical 
design. The workshop course consists of carpenter work and wood turning, mill- 
wrighting and steam fitting, machinist work, blacksmithing, moulding and founding, and 
pattern making. The carpenter work includes the preparation of tools and exercises in 
planing, sawing, and framing. The instruction in wood turning is upon the care and 
management of the lathe, the production of definite forms, and the action of woods 
while being turned. The practice in ihillwrighting and steam fitting is thorough and 
complete, as it is in the other departments of actual work. The school has long had a 
machine and carpenter shop, an iron and brass foundry, and a blacksmith shop. During 
the past year (1881) a new machine shop has been fitted up and presented to the insti- 
tute. It is 50 by 80 feet in area and has galleries running along the four sides. An 
engine near the centre drives two lines of shafting connecting with machine tools. They 
consist of fourteen lathes of different sizes,two planers, two drill presses, and one mill- 
ing machine. At the presentation exercises, President Henry Morton spoke of shop 
practice, as might the heads of other schools or departments of mechanical engineering, 
in the following words: 
‘We have no idea of allowing our workshop course in any way to displace the valuable 
instruction of the other departments ; but, on the contrary, we intend that it shall render 
them only more efficient; by making closer their relations to what every student sees to 
be the object of his course here, namely, the acquirement of the various and extensive 
—scientific, mathematical, and practical—which will enable him to grapple 
y with the vast and difficult problems daily presented to the mechanical en-     
    succes\ 
gineer. 
About the year 1869 the Iowa Agricultural College established a course in mechanical 
engineering. Previously there had been a shop connected with the college; but it was 
made of service in purely utilitarian work for the college, which was chiefly concerned uw 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
CLXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
with agriculture. While repairs were being made and other work done, the students 
had opportunities to earn wages and learn the use of tools. On thereorganization of the 
college, instruction in branches contributing to mechanical knowledge was arranged in a 
course by itself, which followed closely the agricultural course for a year and a half and 
then was characterized by special studies in the mechanic arts. The plan has been 
changed little since. The work in the shop, consisting of a series of exercises such as are 
involved in the construction of models and simple pieces of apparatus, has become more 
regular and systematic. It is required for two or three hours a week during freshman, 
junior, and senior years. Much work is done in the mechanical laboratory during junior 
year and the study of steam occupies considerable time in senior year. 
Although there had been a design to locate a branch of the Illinois Industrial Univer- 
sity at Chicago, in which there should be instruction in the mechanic arts, yet a shop 
was provided at the opening of the university at Champaign in which students learned 
something of mechanical processes. No regular course of practice was taken and no pro- 
fessor of mechanical engineering appointed until 1870. Training was obtained by con- 
structing parts of machines and hy performing work needed by the university. In 1870 
Professor Robinson entered upon his duties as professor of mechanical engineering, arranged 
a course of study and practice, and commenced the equipment of shops. By his advice 
an engine, a lathe, machine tools, a forge and its accessories, raw material, and other 
necessawies were provided, and the shop was enlarged. In 1871 a building 128 by 
88 feet was erected, in which were a boiler and forge room; a machine shop, furnished 
with steam engine, lathes, and other machinery; pattern and finishing shop, and shops 
for carpentry, cabinet work, wood working machinery, paint rooms, printing room, 
draughting rooms, &c. Over seven thousand dollars’ worth of new machines and tools 
was added to the outfit of the several shops, and the attendance upon this course of in- 
struction rapidly increased, and practice became more systematic. In 1878 a course in 
mechanical engineering was announced, which has been adhered to closely to the present 
time. It gives the student practice in five shops which are devoted to (1) pattern making, 
(2) blacksmithing, (3) moulding and founding, (4) bench work for iron, and (5) machine 
tool work for iron, respectively. In the first the practice consists of planing, turning, 
chiselling, and the preparation of patterns for casting. The shop has a complete set of 
tools, benches, and vises. The common operations of blacksmithing are undertaken in 
the second shop and those of casting in the third. In the fourth shop there is a course 
of free hand bench work, and afterward the fitting of parts is undertaken. In the fifth 
shop all the fundamental operations on iron by machinery are practised. The actual 
work done is carefully outlined beforehand by drawings; and the designing of machines 
and their elements is required. 
Instruction in mechanical engineering in Cornell University received its chief impulse 
in 1870, when provision was made by Hon. Hiram Sibley for the erection of a building 
for the department of mechanic arts. A course four years in length and another three 
years in length had been arranged at the organization of the university or soon after. 
Upon the completion of the building and the equipment of its rooms the department was 
in a condition to supply practical as well as theoretical instruction. A professorship was 
endowed by the generous benefactor who erected the building and the amount of shop 
practice gradually increased. The University Register of 1876 speaks of the department 
of mechanic arts as follows: 
There are now closely connected with the lecture room, in which the theoretical side of 
the mechanic arts is presented, other rooms for the designing and modelling of machinery 
and workshops fitted with power and machinery for working in wood and metals, in 
which the practical side will be conducted. 
‘The machine shop is to be conducted wholly as a means of instruction, and each stu- 
dent in the department will be required to devote at least two hours a day to work in 
the shop, so that he will not only get theory and practice combined, but he will also 
have opportunities to construct and use tools of the greatest precision. Each candidate   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  INSTRUCTION IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. CLXXV 
for the degree of bachelor of mechanical engineering will be given an opportunity to 
design and construct some machine or piece of apparatus or conduct a series of experi- 
ments, approved by the department, such as promise to be of public utility. 
At present the professional studies are pursued chiefly in the fourth year of the course; 
but experimental mechanics, machine construction, and mill work are studied in the 
second or third year; drawing and shop practice continue through the course. The 
studies of the fourth year are mechanism, machine drawing, and mechanics in the first 
term; designing machinery, steam engine, and practice in the physical laboratory in the 
second term; and in the third term building materials and construction, field practice, 
and the use of instruments, the preparation of working drawings, and special study. 
The shop practice embraces work requiring the use of all hand tools and of the machines 
ordinarily employed in machine shops. 
In 1871 a distinct course in mechanical engineering was announced by the officers 
of the O’Fallon Polytechnic Institute of Washington University, St. Louis: It extended 
over two years and was preceded by two years of general scientific study. Its studies in- 
cluded mathematics, descriptive geometry, drawing (through the course), mechanics, 
physics, chemistry, mineralogy, geology, astronomy, and English studies. A workshop, 
was commenced soon afterward. At the outset its equipment consisted of a lathe, ma- 
chine tools, carpenters’ tools, and benches. It has been supplied from time to time with 
other tools, until now the admirable and extensive shops of the Manual Training School 
are at the service of engineering students. Before the opening of this school students had 
practice in three shops: the carpenters’, the blacksmiths’, and the machine shop. The 
carpenters’ shop contained work benches, drawers, and tools for twenty students. The 
blacksmith shop had two forges and the essential tools for forge work. The machine 
shop contained 10 lathes of various patterns, a scroll saw, a planer, and a gear cutter. 
Two afternoons a week were assigned for shop practice, and the work thus done did not 
diminish the intellectual tasks required. 
In 1872 the legislature of Minnesota created a college of mechanic arts in the State 
University. In the next college year a course in mechanical engineering was constituted 
by giving increased attention in the last year of the civil engineering course to physics, 
applied mechanics, and machines. ‘In 1875 a beginning in fitting up a shop for the accom- 
modation of students in mechanical engineering was reported. The nucleus of an equip- 
ment then existed in the shape ofa lathe and accompanying tools. Thestudy of machinery 
and other branches of mechanical engineering was commenced with junior year. During 
the present year (1881) shops have been equipped for practice. They are (1) a wood 
shop, with benches, lathe, and wood working tools; (2) a vise shop, with benches, vises, 
files, and other ‘‘fitting’”’ tools; and (3) a forge shop, with a steam engine of eight horse 
power, eight forges, anvils, and the necessary forging tools. The prospect of satisfactory 
results is most gratifying. It is intended to devote the first term to vise work, the sec- 
ond to forge work, and the third to wood work. 
A course in mechanical engineering was started at the commencement of the college 
year in 1872 at the Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts. It was 
attempted by it to lay a solid foundation in the knowledge of the principles of machinery, 
and at the same time to make the instruction of practical value by means of problems in 
construction and design, particular attention being given to drawing. The college has 
never had shops for instruction, but a room has been fitted up for vise work. In this 
way students acquire a degree of manual dexterity. 
In 1872 the University of Pennsylvania organized a department of science, having 
courses in (1) analytical and applied chemistry and mineralogy, (2) geology and mining, 
(3) civil engineering, and (4) mechanical engineering. The courses were identical for two 
years and distinct for two years. The special studies of the course in mechanical engi- 
neering were applied mechanics, machinery, drawing, and descriptive geometry. Visits 
to machine shops and factories and the examination of models of bridges, roofs, and 
mechanical structures formed part of the plan of instruction. Recently the course ha

been made five years in length. Special attention is given to drawing, first from designs 
and models and afterwards from calculations, to casting and working in iron, and to 
making and using machine tools. The cabinet of models now contains representations of 
various kinds of steam engines, American and foreign machinery, pulleys, shafting and 
coupling, various products of iron manufacture, and working drawings of constructed 
machinery. Opportunity for graduate study is afforded. 
The school of mechanical engineering of Lehigh University requires two and a half 
years of professional study of candidates for the degree of mechanical engineer. The 
degree is also conferred upon graduates of the school of civil engineering who devote a 
year to the study of stereotomy, thermodynamics, kinematics, metallurgy, machine draw- 
ing and construction. The instruction is largely theoretical. Workshop lectures and 
visits of inspection have been included. Theshop instruction does notnecessarily involve 
manual labor and the manipulation of tools, but rather aims to familiarize students with 
those points in pattern making, moulding, forging, fitting, and furnishing which design- 
ers of machinery need to know. 
In 1873 the organic law of the Kansas State Agricultural College was revised and nu- 
merous industrial departments were created. A carpenter shop was provided and stu- 
dents were furnished with bench room and tools. They were taught the uses and names 
of tools, required to put them in order and keep them so, and given regular practice in 
sawing, planing, tenoning, mitring, and house framing, building, and finishing. Useful 
articles were also made for the college or the student himself. The carpenter shop is 
now better equipped than in 1873, having separate benches and tools for twenty students 
in a class, besides machines and tools for finer work. There is also a shop for iron work. 
The similarity of the instruction in carpentry given at present with that commenced in 
1873 is shown by the following recent statement: 
On entering the shops all are enrolled as carpenters and take the same first lessons in 
sawing, planing, and dressing lumber, making mortises, tenons, and joints, and in gen- 
eral use and care of tools. Later, one who chooses a trade is provided with work in the 
line chosen, while the farmers’ course provides for general training in a great variety of 
operations, rather for ingenuity than for skill. In the full course of a carpenter special 
instructions are given in the whole range of work, from framing to stair-building. Stu- 
dents are allowed, after attaining sufficient skill,4o work upon their own materials, 
under the advice of the superintendent. All are required to take at least one term of 
practice in the shop during the first year at college. In iron work instruction is given 
in ordinary forging, filing, tempering, &c. 
No studies directly pertaining to mechanical engineering are taken in the course of 
sttidy prescribed for all the students of the college. Drawing, mechanics, and civil en- 
gineering are the most nearly related. 
The professional studies in mechanical engineering in the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology had been given in 1873 three years (instead of two as at first) and only one 
year of the course was devoted exclusively to generalstudy. The direct engineering instruc- 
tion was then given in three courses: the mathematical, the practical, and the graphical. 
They were carried on together with the same class. In the practical course the entire 
attention was given to the application of theory as involved in practice. In the-graph- 
ical course it was intended to supplement each exercise in theory or practice by a draw- 
ing exercise covering the same ground. The instruction was aided by large collections 
of models of carpentry, masonry and stone cutting, bridges, machines, and mechanisms. 
‘The International Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876 gave a new phase to instruction in , 
mechanical engineering, allying it firmly to shop practic The lessons then taught by 
the exhibit of foreign nations, especially Russia, were utilized immediately by those 
holding a controlling influence in the Institute of Technology. Shops for wood work, 
forging, founding, and machine tool work were provided. Cou of practice were laid 
out to be pursued by not only the pupils in the school of mechanic arts, but also by the 
students of mechanical engineering. This plan was modified somewhat by the intro- 
duction of the shop practice mentioned above, and a course adopted varying from the

  one now pursued chiefly in being less restricted to technical branches. The present 
course shows the studies adjudged by good authorities to be essential to the education of 
a mechanical engineer. It is as follows: 
First year: Algebra, geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, chemistry, qualita- 
tive analysis, laboratory work, rhetoric, English composition, English history and Jitera- 
ture, French, drawing, military drill. 
Second year: Setting of machines, transmission and production of power, kinematics

physics, descriptive astronomy, physical geography, English history and literature, Ger- 
man, pattern and foundry work (shop work), carpentry. 
Third year: Combustion of fuel, steam generators and steam engines, machine draw- 
ing, machine design, elements of thermodynamics, steam engineering laboratory, inte- 
gral calculus, general statics, strength of materials, blacksmithing (shop work), physics, 
lectures and laboratory work, constitutional history, political economy, German, kine- 
matics and dynamics, chipping and filing (shop work). 
Fourth year: Machine design, measurement and regulation of power, machine draw- 
ing, thermodynamics of steam and other heat engines, pumping engines, hydraulic 
motors, machines and regulators, abstracts from memoirs, steam engineering laboratory, 
strength of materials, hydraulics, metallurgy, theory of elasticity, dynamics, building 
materials, blacksmithing (shop work), engine lathe work (shop work), thesis work. 
A course in physics and mechanical éngineering was arranged at the opening of Pur- 
due University, La Fayette, Ind., in 1874. In 1878 President White recommended the 
adoption of the Russian system, the employment of a competent instructor, and the fur- 
nishing of the necessary shops. In October, 1879, the school for practical training in 
mechanics was opened. The shop was placed in the charge of Prof. W. F. M. Goss, a 
graduate of the department of mechanics of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
It was fitted to accommodate five students, giving them practice, not in special trades, but 
in the use of typical hand and machine tools for working in wood and iron and in the 
elementary principles which underlie mechanical trades. The course is two years in 
length and includes ten weeks of bench work in wood, twelve weeks of pattern mak- 
ing, ten weeks of bench work in iron, twenty weeks of forging, and eighteen weeks of 
machine work. 
The machinery is driven by steam power from the engine house. The shop contains 
five benches for wood working, with sets of carpenter tools, a large power turning lathe, 
scroll saw, and other tools for a large variety of work. The machines, tools, and fixtures 
for iron work include (1) benches fitted with Parker vises, sets of files, chisels, ham- 
mers, hardened steel squares, gauges, calipers, and other tools needed for all kinds of 
bench work in iron; (2) forges of improved pattern, with air blast furnished by a Stur- 
tevant blower driven by steam power, and all the common smithing tools, such as 
anvils, hammers, tongs, chisels, &¢.; (3) an engine or machine lathe, 2 machine planer 
of the best pattern, a vertical drill press, an emery grinder and grindstone, with a sup- 
ply of small tools: chucks, drills, taps, and dies, and lathe and planer tools, &c. 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas was organized in 1876 and reorgan- 
ized in 1880. ‘Two courses of study were then laid out, one in agriculture and the other 
in mechanics. Each was three years in length and included no foreign languages. The 
mechanical course required drawing and shop work throughout. The shop work of the 
first year includes elementary constructions in wood with hand tools and practice with 
wood working machinery ; second year, elementary metal working, machine tool work, 
practical steam enginery, and mill work; third year, work on original designs and ex- 
periments and a graduation construction. There are shops for (1) carpenter work, (2) 
forge work, (3) vise work, (4) machine wood work, (5) machine metal work, and (6) 
steam enginery. The equipment of the shops cost about $5,000. All work is executed 
from drawings and must come up to the standard of good workmanship. The progress 
of the student through the shop practice is described by the professor of mechanical en- 
gineering as follows: 
Beginning with wood working by hand tools, he will be promoted from that to the 
use and care of wood working machinery, such as circular and fret saws and the turn-

  ing lathe. Then he will be made stock clerk and time keeper; after that take a course 
of instruction in working of metals with hand tools, such as filing, chipping, and other 
vise work, erecting of machinery; then be put in charge of the boiler, and from that 
duly promoted to engineer, to take charge of the engine and power; and from that goes 
to drilling, boring, turning, screw cutting, and other machine tool work, when he is to 
begin work on his graduating piece, which is to be made entirely by himself and be a 
whole or part of the subject treated of in his graduating thesis. 
In 1877 the University of Wisconsin established a department of mechanical engineer- 
ing and equipped a machine shop for practical work. The course of study commences 
with sophomore year, and is devoted to mathematical, scientific, and practical work, to 
the general exclusion of literary and linguistic branches. Ten hours a week of shop 
work are required. The instruction is conducted upon a system combining training in 
elementary and fundamental processes with the construction of machines and the per- 
formance of profitable labor. The shop is a well lighted room, 38 by 40 feet in area and 
14 feet in height, and contains the most approved tools and machinery, The motive 
power is furnished by a 30 horse power steam engine. 
In 1878 a gentleman was called to the chair of physics and mechanics in the Ohio 
State University who was especially interested in mechanical engineering. Up to that 
time physics had received attention to the exclusion of mechanics. Then a course in 
the latter subject was instituted, in which were included mechanism, machine drawing 
and designing, thermodynamics, prime movers, machinery, mill work, strength of ma- 
terials, and laboratory practice. The mechanical laboratory was not in shape for use 
until 1880 and seems to be equipped simply as a workshop. It is said to ‘‘ contain all 
the machinery now necessary to the practical training of young men fitting themselves 
for the work of the mechanical engineer.’’ It occupies a building admirably arranged 
for the proper location within it of work benches, vises, and machinery. The practice 
in the mechanical laboratory is had during sophomore year and consists mostly of ex- 
_ercises in the use of common tools. Fourteen students have taken the course during 
the past fall term. 
In 1881 the University of Michigan availed itself of the provision of Congress allowing 
engineers in the Navy to be detailed as professors in colleges. It thus secured the ser- 
vices of a gentleman qualified to oversee the establishment of a department of mechanical 
engineering as well as to instruct in the branches specially contemplated in the statute 
under which the professor was assigned. The act of Congress provided — 
That, for the purpose of promoting a knowledge of steam engineering and iron ship- 
building among the young men of the United States, the President may, upon the appli- 
cation of an established scientific school or college within the United States, detail an officer 
from the Engineer Corps of the Navy as professor in such school or college: Provided, 
‘That the number of officers so detailed shall not at any time exceed twenty-five, and such 
details shall be governed by rules to be prescribed from time to time by the President: 
And provided further, That such details may be withheld or withdrawn whenever, in the 
judgment of the President, the interests of the public service shall so require. 
The State has appropriated $2,500 for a mechanical laboratory in connection with the 
department of engineering, and it has been decided to expend the sum in erecting and 
equipping a shop for practice in the mechanic arts. The department of engineering is 
now fully organized by the provision of courses in civil, mining, and mechanical engi- 
neering. 
MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
A school of mechanic arts was founded at Boston, Mass., in August, 1876, by a vote 
of the corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a recent article on 
the manual element in education, Prof. J. D, Runkle, LL. D., says: 
This school, in which special prominence is given to manual education, has been estab- 
lished for those who wish to enter upon industrial pursuits rather than to become scien- 
tific engineers. It is designed to afford such students as have completed the ordinary 
grammar school course an opportunity to continue the elementary, scientific, and literary
-P-A-G-E-179
  
  INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. CLXXIX 
studies, together with mechanical and free hand drawing, while receiving theoretical and 
practical instruction in these various arts, including the nature and economic value of | 
the materials with which they deal. Nine hours per week —three lessons of three hours 
each—of the students’ time are devoted to shop work, and the balance to drawing and 
other studies, only one shop course, except in the case of special shop students, being 
carried on at a time. 
The plan of shop work is similar to that of the imperial.technical school at Moscow, 
Russia. The studies, outside of the shops, are, for the first year, algebra to equations 
of the second degree, plane geometry, mechanical drawing, and English composition; for 
the second year, algebra, physics, mechanical drawing, and English composition. The 
mechanic art courses are as follows: In wood: (1) carpentry and joinery; (2) wood turn- 
ing; (3) pattern making. In iron: (1) vise work; (2) forging; (3) foundry work; (4) 
mechanical tool work. 
The wood working shop is 50 by 20 feet in area. At one end of the room 16 lathes 
are arranged on two long benches, so that there are four lathes on each side of each bench. 
Beneath the lathes are drawers for tools. At the other end of the room carpentry and 
joinery benches are placed. In the middle are saws for cutting lumber to desired dimen- 
sions. The machine tool shop contains 16 engine lathes, 4 speed lathes, and a mill- 
ing machine. The vise shop contains 4 heavy benches, with 32 vises attached. This 
gives a capacity for teaching 128 students the course every 10 weeks, or 640 students in 
a year of 50 weeks. The forge shop has eight forges. The foundry has 16 moulding 
benches, an oven for core baking, and a blast furnace of one-half ton capacity. 
Mr. Thomas Foly, who is in charge of the forging, vise work, and machine tool work, 
Says : 
The plan here is to give to the student the fundamental principles in such lessons as 
will teach them most clearly and give practice enough in the shortest time to acquire 
a knowledge of the different kinds of tools and various ways of using them. For in- 
stance, if a man can make a small article in iron, steel, or any other material perfectly 
by such methods, he can make it of larger proportions with the additional time and 
help required for such an undertaking. The same in degrees of heat required for fusing 
or welding metals: if he can do it well in a lesser degree, he can certainly do so in a 
greater, with the additional facilities. 
After nearly five years’ experience in the workshops in my charge, with the valuable 
suggestions of the professors so much interested in the success of the school, we find the 
best results in the time allowed accomplished by the method now in use in the institute 
workshops, viz, three lessons per week of three hours each. The time is just sufficient 
to create a vigorous interest without tiring; it also leaves a more lasting impression than 
by taxing the physical powers for a longer period. We have tried four hours a day, and 
find that a larger amount of work and of better quality can be produced in the three 
hour lessons. 
The Manual Training School of Washington University, St. Louis, which was de- 
scribed in my last annual report and a short account of which may be found in the 
appendix, has had a year of gratifying prosperity. 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR MINERS AND MECHANICS. 
A school of a grade hardly as high as that of manual training schools was opened 
in May, 1879, at Drifton, Pa., for the instruction of young miners in subjects imme- 
diately relating to their work. The instruction is given in the evening, except when 
mining operations are suspended. Then pupils are expected, but not compelled, to 
attend from 9 to 12 0’clock A. M. and from 2 to 5 o’clock Pp. M. The usual length of 
eyening sessions is two hours. Preparatory, junior, and senior classes are organized, and 
an advanced expert class is planned. The pupils of the preparatory class pursue the 
common English branches, algebra to evolution, free hand and mechanical drawing, and 
geometry, with particular reference to its relations to drawing. Object lessons are given 
frequently, as they are found serviceable in awakening dormant faculties. The junior 
studies continue in the same line. The elements of book-keeping are taught with a 
special view to the pupil’s improvement in penmanship and arithmetic. Algebra and

  geometry are supplemented by trigonometry, mensuration, and analytical geometry. 
A course in geometrical projection aims to give the pupil facility in drawing any figure 
in plan elevation or section, both with instruments and by free hand. Natural philoso- 
phy and elementary mechanics are attempted. Chemistry is taught, that the pupils 
may become acquainted with the names, properties, and combining proportions of the 
most important elements, particularly with those which enter into the composition of 
the common minerals. Simple chemical tests for minerals are undertaken. The instruc- 
tion in mineralogy and lithology is confined to the more generally occurring minerals 
and rocks, and those of most immediate interest. The aim of the junior studies is to 
lay a thorough foundation in mathematics and drawing for subsequent instruction. 
The studies of the senior year are chiefly in drawing, mining, and preparation of prod- 
ucts. The work in drawing includes the elements of construction in wood, stone, and 
metal, the making of working drawings, and the design of simple structures and ma- 
chines. Mining includes (1) the useful minerals and metals, their occurrence and the 
methods of exploration; (2) the various means employed for the extraction of ores; (3) 
opening and laying out mines; (4) methods of exploitation; (5) maintenance of mines 
in good order; (6) transportation; (7) drainage; (8) ventilation; (9) mine surveying and 
mapping; (10) accidents and their prevention; (11) accounts, contracts, and estimates; 
and (12) hygiene of mines and remedies in case of injuries. The instruction is entirely 
free, and the effects of the school are seen in the improved manners and morals of the 
pupils. They are earnest in study and aspire to become competent foremen. Effort is 
made to have them perform intelligent labor while pursuing their studies, that their 
senses may not be blunted and that their surroundings may furnish objects illustrating 
subjects of study and stimulating thought and inquiry about them. 
ROYAL AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL AT BERLIN. 
The following is an abstract of two publications! received by the Bureau of Education 
from Berlin containing accounts of the recently established agricultural high school : 
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCHOOL, 
While the establishment ofan agricultural institution at Berlin was suggested as early 
as the year 1847, the idea of founding an agricultural museum was not conceived until 
the year 1860, and decisive steps were not taken until 1867, the year of the Paris Inter- 
national Exposition. This exhibition, at which German agriculture was prominently 
represented, induced the Prussian government to grant the necessary means for the 
establishment of a museum. Numerous and valuable donations were received from for- 
eign and German exhibitors at Paris, and a fair beginning was made towards the estab- 
lishment of a great institution. On the 19th December, 1867, the Prussian Diet author- 
ized the government to purchase a suitable site for the erection of a building. Several 
years passed before a suitable site was agreed upon, and it was not until 1876 that the 
building was commenced under the superintendence of the royal architect, Tiede. The 
magnificent structure was completed in 1881 and cost 2,527,000 marks ($601,426). Until 
the completion of the building the museum and the agricultural high school were under 
separate control, the school being considered an annex to the university. On the 14th 
February, 1881, the two institutions were united by royal decree, and both are at pres- 
ent known under the name of ‘‘agricultural high school”? (landwirthschaftliche Hoch- 
schule). 
By ministerial decree of May 27, 1881, the school is placed under the jurisdiction of 
the minister of agriculture and forestry. The minister appoints a board of curators, 
who represent him in the management of the school. The staff of professors consists of 
a rector, elected every year by the professors and approved by the ministers, and a num-

A Hebrew summer school was organized in the summer of 1881 by William R. 
Harper, professor of Hebrew in the Baptist Union Theological Seminary. It held its 
sessions at Morgan Park, Ill., during the months of July and August and enrolled 22 
students. 
This school was organized to meet the wants of the following classes of persons: 
(1) Ministers, or persons about to enter the ministry, who cannot avail themselves of 
the opportunities afforded by a theological seminary, and yet desire to gain a knowledge 
of the Hebrew language. (2) Ministers who have some knowledge of the Hebrew, yet 
find the language of little advantage to them because of its ‘‘strangeness.’”? (3) Minis- 
ters and students, more advanced in the language, who wish to pursue their studies

  further and to gain a greater familiarity than is possible in the time which is devoted 
to it in the regular theological course. 
The following points were made prominent in the work of the summer school: 
(1) The almost exclusive use of the inductive method in imparting grammatical in- 
struction. (2) The particular attention paid to translating at sight. (3) The importance 
attached to the memorizing of those words which are of most frequent occurrence.

    LEGAL INSTRUCTION. CLXXXV 
The schools of law seem to have decreased in number and increased slightly in attend- 
ance. Their work is of much interest to the public. The legislative affairs of the 
States and nation are greatly influenced, if not controlled, by lawyers; the judicial func- 
tions of the Government are performed by them. They advise not only in the concerns 
of state, but also in matters of business and family life. Their relation with the rights 
and duties of all is so intimate that the interests of every citizen are affected by the 
manner in which they are prepared for their profession. As was said by Hon. Dorman 
B. Eaton some years ago: ‘‘ Every citizen, however exalted or however humble, however 
rich or however poor, has a deep interest in extending the knowledge of the laws and in 
raising the character and enlarging the attainments of those who practise or preside in 
the tribunals of justice.” 
The objects of the true school of law are to give its pupils familiarity with existing 
law, an understanding of the principles on which it rests, a knowledge of the events and 
causes which have moulded it into its present shape, and a comprehension of its relations 
to public affairs and private life. It has been questioned whether the educational senti- 
ment of our colleges is such as to uphold the extension and elevation of courses of pro- 
fessional study. Prof. C. C. Langdell, of the Harvard Law School, argues that ideas 
unfavorable to thorough professional training have been received from English universi- 
ties and adopted by American colleges. Among them, he enumerates the following: 
That professional learning or professional knowledge (as it would rather be called) isa 
thing to be ‘‘ picked up”’ by degrees and acquired by experience and practice, like the 
knowledge of any ordinary business or pursuit; that one’s professional eminence will 
depend (ceteris paribus) upon his academic education and upon his opportunities for prac- 
tising his profession rather than upon the amount of time and labor that he devotes to 
regular and systematic professional study; that professional learning is pursued solely 
for the profits and emoluments which it brings, and that these will cause it to be pursued 
with sufficient eagerness; that the public has no interest in increasing the number of 
doctors and lawyers, and, though it has an interest in improving their quality, yet that 
object, so far as it depends upon professional study, will be best secured by the principle 
of competition. 
Doubtless the eagerness of young men to enter upon active life and the opinion of many 
of the members of the bar are more influential in limiting the instruction of the law 
school than ideas inculeated by our colleges. Yet against all the feelings and circum- 
stances that oppose them many schools of law strive to make their requirements for 
admission as high as practicable and their course of study as long and comprehensive as 
the sentiments of the community in which they exist will sanction. The University of 
Michigan does not advocate the requirement of the completion of a college course 
by those who apply for admission to its department of law, but its acting president 
says in his last report: ‘‘The professional schools cannot be excused for admitting stu_ 
dents without respectable preparation.’’ Persons intending to study law in Boston Uni- 
versity ‘‘are earnestly recommended to complete a course of liberal studies in some col- 
lege before entering.’’? The admission of applicants who are candidates for a degree in 
Columbia College (New York) Law School is regulated by the following rules: 
All graduates of literary colleges are admitted without examination. Other candidates 
must be at least eighteen years of age and have received a good academic education, in- 
cluding such a knowledge of the Latin language as is required for admission to the fresh- 
man class of the School of Arts. 
Soon after the adoption of these rules President F. A. P. Barnard said: 
Though the institution of the entrance examination has had the effect to reduce the 
attendance, it has undoubtedly improved its character and has thus been beneficial to 
the school. The requisitions for admission are placed so low that the candidate who is 
excluded by them can hardly possess a degree of mental culture sufficient to justify his 
attempting the study of a learned profession; nor is he likely to do credit to the school, 
either as a student or as a graduate. 
The methods of instruction employed in law schools include recitations, lectures, and 
moot courts. The tendency is now to give recitation an increasingly important place. 
The instruction of the Columbia College Law School is imparted by a system of ques-  
-P-A-G-E-186
CLXXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
    tions, expositions, and dictations, excluding, in the main, lectures in the ordinary sense. 
A daily recitation and examination are held in the leading branches of the course at the 
School of Law of Boston University. ‘The lecture system is still maintained, and a large 
part of the instruction given in that way. Hon. William G. Hammond, Lu.pD., dean of 
the St. Louis Law School, thinks that the full benefit of lectures is attainable only by 
exceptional trained intellects, and that the receptive state of mind in which a class must 
be during their delivery is unfavorable to mental discipline and activity of thought. He 
would, however, unite lectures with recitations. The authorities of the Union College 
of Law, at Chicago, say: 
Experience has taught us that the recitation system, in which each student is exam- 
ined daily or oftener in the presence of his class, with the advantage of mutual criticism 
and free inquiry by his associates and corrections by the professor, with the stimulus of 
a generous emulation and desire to excel, is a more effectual method of imparting a 
thorough and accurate knowledge of legal principles than any system of mere oral 
instruction by lectures. 
Moot courts form a part of the approved routine of law schools. They were abolished 
a few years since as a stated exercise in Harvard Law School, but when the professors 
expressed a readiness to hold them four courts were organized. The object in view is to 
give students an opportunity to become familiar with the practical side of the lawyer’s 
work in conducting cases in court. Pleadings, arguments, and motions are made and. 
the forms of judicial procedure are observed. Perhaps the most valuable service of the 
moot court is to induce the student to investigate with great thoroughness a particular 
point in law, as he will be obliged to do in actual practice, to discover the relation which 
it has to others, the analogies between his case and similar cases in the reports, and 
to anticipate objections and prepare answers for them. As it is valuable for attorneys 
to add to a general knowledge of law a complete mastery of special branches, so it is 
well for a student to have learned thoroughly the principles that govern the law in its 
application to some individual cases. The exercises of moot courts are esteemed so 
highly by the faculty of the School of Law of Boston University that ‘‘it is purposed to 
require hereafter, as a condition for promotion to the degree of bachelor of laws, a par- 
ticipation by each candidate in at least two moot courts during the last year.” 
In an address delivered upon his resignation of the chancellorship of the law depart- 
ment of the State University of Iowa, Hon. William G. Hammond, LL.D., summed up 
his hopes for the future of American law schools in the following points: 
First, that more attention may be given to the method of teaching law, so as to bring 
our schools, i in this respect, more nearly on a level with those in which the other parts of 
a liberal education are taught. * * * 
Second, that the relation of theory to practice will be better understood, so that teach- 
ers and students alike will neither make the mistake of relegating practice to the offices 
as something unfit for School study, nor of neglecting theory as something unlikely to be 
of practicaluse. * * 
Third, this can only i done by the use of such helps as have been found most efficient 
in other schools, and especially by the use of text books exactly adapted to their pur- 
pose and brought fully up to the latest standard both of theory and practice. * * * 
Fourth, in such text books we may reasonably expect to be free from the vapid gen- 
eralities which i in so many of our present books pass for the philosophy of law, and the 
wearisome repetition of stale and abandoned theories, such as have made the very name 
of theory unwelcome to many a student. In their place we shall have a theory of jam 
which answers to the actual facts and satisfies the mind of the present age. * * 
Fifth and lastly, I base my hopes for the future very largely upon that reams 
change in human thought which, under the somewhat vague title of the historical 
method, has done so much within a generation or two for the whole circle of moral 
sciences. * * * We may expect to see the attorney’s manuals weeded of the con- 
stant references to a past condition of things which are now necessary to explain the 
facts and even the language of to-day. In their place, we may hope, will come a clear 
and satisfactory study, once for allin the course of ev ery school, of the history of the 
common law, tracing the growth and development of its institutions and principles from 
the forests of Germany, through the events of fifteen hundred years, down to the form 
which they take in our own day and country, and thus laying the most firm and rational 
basis for the settlement of its disputed questions, the clearing up of its dark places, the 
entire study and practice of the law of our own land.
-P-A-G-E-187
    LEGAL INSTRUCTION. CLXXXVII 
Strict requirements of candidates for degrees and for admission to the bar tend to pro- 
mote thoroughness in preparation. The nature of man is such that he will exert himself 
most intensely only under a present necessity. It is necessary that a lawyer should pre- 
pare himself thoroughly for his profession; yet the stimulus of distant rewards and the 
application of mind due to interest in the study of law may be increased by the imme- 
diate necessity of passing an exhaustive examination. Whether it be conducted by the 
faculty of a school of law or by officers of a court and whether it be for a university 
degree or for a license to practise, its effects are similar. In any case the candidate is 
certified to the public by recognized judges as fit to render service to clients in legal 
questions and controversies. An English writer has said: 
Formerly barristers were very much like bullion, which the public had to assay for 
themselves; but when they are to be sent out in the form of coin there must be no doubt 
as to the quality of the gold. Any other result would be derogatory to the dignity of 
the profession and must be guarded against in every possible way by the most stringent 
provisions, the most inflexible rules, the most unqualified restrictions, and the most 
peremptory requirements and prohibitions. 
Hon. Dorman B. Eaton, LL. D., in an address on the public relations of the legal 
profession, said: 
If there are any merchants, manufacturers, farmers, or honest people of any sort who 
wish that examinations for the har shall become mere farces, who desire to increase the 
number of cunning and conscienceless promoters of quarrels, who want no guarantee of 
honesty or capacity, when, beyond the sphere of personal acquaintance, they are com- 
pelled to trust their property and their characters to strange attorneys, then let all such 
persons at once join hands with those unworthy persons at the bar and beyond the bar 
who desire every barrier and every responsibility removed. * * * If, on the other 
- hand, the people are interested in having only such a selected number of practising 
lawyers as are really needed for honest purposes; if the exercise of a lucrative public 
function, by special privilege and the certainty that those admitted to the bar are to fill 
the seats of justice, cause lawyers above all others to be justly amenable to stern tests 
of character and attainments, * * * then why should not all worthy people unite 
and make and sternly enforce adequate laws for securing what the public welfare 
demands? 
Admission to the bar is the subject of a carefully prepared article published recently 
in the American Law Review by Hon. Francis L. Wellman. I take from it the follow- 
ing quotations: 
The system of legal study is governed almost exclusively by the system of examina- 
tion that admits to the bar. * * * It may be argued that of themselves examina- 
tions are a direct evil, since they encourage a system of cramming and bad habits of 
study; as Wolfesaid, ‘‘ Perversestudet qui examinibus studet.’? Such argumentsinsome cases 
may have weight, but in the law they should be directed, not against the examinations 
themselves, but against the practice that prevails in most States of making the examina- 
tions the only test. It is to remove the temptation to cram that we have so strongly 
urged the adoption of a definite term of pupilage and the other precautionary measures 
already dwelt upon. 
Of law school privileges he says: 
The advantages afforded by law schools for acquiring a comprehensive knowledge of 
the law are now very generally appreciated by the profession and the public. There is 
no better preparation for the bar, in our opinion, than that afforded by a two or three 
years’ course at a good law school, supplemented by a third or fourth year in an office of 
a practising lawyer; and it is a matter of surprise that, while there has been a strong 
movement in many of the States for raising the standard of qualification for admission 
to the profession, it has never appeared to be in any degree the aim of the movement 
either to support and strengthen the schools or even to make use of them in the further- 
ance of the objects in view. Certainly the time well spent in any respectable law school, 
as proved by passing its examinations, should count towards admission to the bar in any 
State like time spent in an office. 
Of the requirements for admission to the bar in the several States, he says: 
Fifteen out of thirty-eight require a definite term of pupilage, but differ widely as to 
the proper length of this term. In fifteen States the diploma of certain Jaw schools is 
recognized and accepted in lieu of the public bar examinations; these privileges are, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
    CLXXXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
most cases, confined to the schools situated within the State or county limits, a strange 
inconsistency. In but six of the number is any value given to the degree of bachelor 
of arts. Seven of the list prescribe a definite course of study, on which the examina- 
tions are based; this requirementis usually intended to take the place of a definite term of 
pupilage; not so in Pennsylvania and Oregon, however. New Hampshire alone esteems 
the examiners’ labor worthy of compensation. Pennsylvania and Delaware are conspicu- 
ous as requiring a preliminary examination in Latin and on all the branches of a com- 
mon high school education. New York and New Jersey distinguish between attorneys 
and counsellors in their requirements for admission to practice; and in ten States women 
have been admitted on equal standing with the men. Nearly all the States have adopted 
the superficial oral method of examination, only five of the number requiring written 
answers to stated questions, and even in these States, excepting New Hampshire, written 
examinations are customary only in certain counties or departments. 
Mr. Wellman proposes a set of rules to regulate admission to the bar. They require 
that persons desiring to become students of law either be college graduates or pass an 
examination in languages (Latin and one modern), mathematics (through plane geome- 
try), American and English history, modern geography, political economy, and elements 
of book-keeping. They shall file a certificate of this fact, and of intention to study law, 
with the clerk of the court, and also the certificate of an attorney, stating when study 
began. The final examination for admission must be both oral and written, before a 
State board, at one of its quarterly examinations at the State capital. No student can 
attend the examination until he has studied three full years in a school or office. A de- 
gree in a law school shall obviate the necessity of examination in two branches pursued 
in the school. Prizes shall be given for excellence in jurisprudence and Roman civil 
law. The expenses of examination and prizes are met by a fee of $10 for examination. 
No person shall be admitted to the bar, upon motion, on the ground that he is a member 
of the bar of another State, unless he has practised two years before the highest courts 
of that State.

|           When the student of medical education in this country compares its extent with that 
of medical education abroad he cannot help thinking either that we are not particular 
enough or that other countries demand too much. When the inquirer further considers 
the enormous amount of knowledge that has been accumulated respecting the proper 
treatment of disease, its prevention and its nature, the impression becomes irresistible 
that we have been influenced by our national impatience and furious haste in this matter 
as in many others, and that we have allowed the students to dictate the length of time 
they are to study instead of obliging them to prepare suitably for this important course 
of instruction and to spend enough time to receive it properly and retain it securely. 
Happily, of late years the good sense of the profession and of the medical colleges has 
attacked this abuse and is correcting it with due diligence and circumspection. An 
important part of the new programme is the requirement of some suitable preliminary 
training and the production of evidence to that effect by an entrance examination. 
COURSES PREPARATORY TO THE STUDY OF MEDICINE. 
A few institutions for higher education have courses of study preparatory to the study 
of medicine. Among them are Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania, and 
Johns Hopkins University. The course at Cornell is two yearsin length. The studies 
of the first year are French, drawing, physics, chemistry, physiology, hygiene, and bot- 
any; of the second year, German, organic and medical chemistry, vegetable physiology, 
histology, anatomy, veterinary medicine and surgery, sanitary science, and psychology. 
The faculty of the university are aware that medical students need a generous education, 
and advise them to take a full four years’ scientific or literary course, with special work 
in laboratories and on important subjects as resident graduates. 
The Towne Scientific School of the University of Pennsylvania has a course pre- 
paratory to the study of medicine extending through five years. The studies of the 
first two years are those pursued by all the students of the school. Many of the stud- 
ies of the remaining three years are common to the six courses existing in the insti- 
tution, and are chiefly scientific. The special studies of the third year preparatory to 
the study of medicine are differential calculus, practical work in the chemical labora-
-P-A-G-E-192
  Cxcil REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  tory, mineralogy, systematic botany (with excursions), and vertebrate and invertebrate 
zodlogy; of the fourth year, organic chemistry, qualitative analysis, and reading of Latin 
authors; and of the fifth year, quantitative analysis, physiological and toxicological chem- 
istry, structural botany, use of the microscope, comparative anatomy, animal mechanics, 
elementary physiology, application of physics, and lectures in geology. Excepting the 
differential calculus these studies form an admirable course of instruction introductory 
to the branches which should receive the principal attention of the medical student. 
The course in Johns Hopkins University for those intending to study medicine is out- 
lined as follows in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal: 
This course extends throughout three years, and as a mental discipline is equivalent 
to the other courses leading to the A. B. degree, which is therefore conferred on matric- 
ulated students who complete it. The main object held in view is to utilize for intend- 
ing medical students the opportunities for practical study in physics, chemistry, and 
biology found in an endowed institution with well equipped laboratories and so often 
wanting in medical schools; it is also considered an object to lessen the work to be sub- 
sequently crowded into the period of study at a medical school by giving the student a 
good knowledge of the sciences which lie at the basis of the medical art before he begins 
his professional study. Physics, chemistry, and biology are therefore the main subjects 
included in the course; some knowledge of French and German is also demanded; and 
there are, also, several subjects (inserted with a view to giving some breadth of culture) 
between which an option is allowed. These are Latin, Greek, mathematics, English 
literature, history, logic, and psychology. Each student must take up at least two of 
these optional subjects, the amount of knowledge required in each being such as would 
be obtained by a year’s honest work. 
ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. 
An inspection of the announcements and catalogues of about eighty medical schools 
has shown that ten have éxaminations for admission. covering several subjects and fourteen 
employ some slight tests of an applicant’s fitness to study medicine. Thesubjectsof exam- 
ination are elementary physics in 8 schools, arithmetic in 7, elementary Latin in 5, gram- 
mar in 4, geography in 4, algebra in 4, geometry in 3, and history in 2. Grammar and 
composition are determined usually from the papers submitted. The amount of phys 
ies required is generally a knowledge of Balfour Stewart’s Primer of Physics or its equiv- 
alent. The Latin requirements are varied, and are intended to show the familiarity of 
the applicant with declensions, conjugations, common words, and simple constructions. 
Algebra to quadratic equations and two books of geometry are usual requirements in 
these branches. The Michigan College of Medicine allows a substitution of either Greek, 
French, German, botany, or zodlogy in place of other studies mentioned above (except 
Latin). French, German, algebra, geometry, and botany are alternative subjects at 
Harvard Medi¢al School, on one of which the candidate must be examined. Botany 
and chemistry, as found in the Science Primers, are required by the Woman’s 
Medical College of the New York Infirmary. College diplomas, degrees from scientific 
schools, graduation from acceptable high schools and academies, and licenses to teach 
public schools are among the proofs of a candidate’s fitness accepted in lieu of examina- 
tion. In the Medical School of Missouri University all students before entering the 
senior class must pass a satisfactory examination on English grammar, rhetoric, history 
of the United States, and arithmetic through common fractions. The recently organized 
Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia has a preparatory feature best described by 
aquotation from its announcement: 
  The necessity of elevating the standard of medical education is universally admitted. 
The times demand that physicians shall be scholarly as well as proficient in medicine. 
Many talented, ambitious young men, capable of becoming excellent physicians, have 
not enjoyed academic or collegiate advantages. With a view ofaiding these, the authori- 
ties of the college have made a progressive departure from the usual curriculum of medi- 
cal colleges by adding a preparatory spring term, the studies of which will embrace the 
elements of English literature, natural science, and elements of Latin and Greek, with- 
out additional expense to the student. This feature must especially commend itself to   
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  MEDICAL INSTRUCTION. Cxcut 
the needs and convenience of many students whose circumstances have been such as to 
prevent them from thoroughly enjoying the benefits of these necessary studies. The 
term is designated the auxiliary literary term, and students who attend it, after passing 
w satisfactory examination, will receive a certificate. Students will be exempt from at- 
tending this term who present proper certificates of having graduated at a high school 
or attended a respectable classical seminary or college for one year, or of having passed a 
preliminary examination of a duly organized county medical society. * * * All 
students who do not exhibit the necessary qualifications will be required to attend 
this term and obtain the certificate of the same before their final examination for the 
degree of doctor of medicine. 
UNDERGRADUATE COURSES. 
The average medical college requires candidates for a degree to study medicine under 
some competent physician three years, attending meanwhile two courses of lectures in 
distinct years and taking the second course in the institution from which the degree 
is sought. Rarely are the requirements in excess of this. Boston University and Har- 
vard University would have the students of their medical schools continue their studies 
a year longer than is customary. The medical student in the University of California 
and in Boston University is required to attend three regular courses of lectures in 
three several years before he can present himself for graduation; and from this year for- 
ward a three years’ graded course is to be an absolute requisite for graduation in the 
Albany (N. Y.) Medical College. Other schools might be mentioned which either urge 
or require a longer period of study than is commonly taken. 
As the time and nominal amount of study are nearly alike for the majority of medical 
schools, the attainments of their students must be indicated by the scope and quality of 
the instruction and by the entrance examinations. The subjects in which candidates for 
positions as surgeons in the United States Army are examined may be taken to show what 
branches are included in a complete medical course. They are anatomy, physiology, 
practice of surgery, practice of medicine, general pathology, obstetrics, diseases of 
women and children, medical jurisprudence, materia medica, therapeutics, pharmacy, 
toxicology, and hygiene. Few schools give full place to all these subjects, and many 
offer special courses, covering only part of the topics included under these heads. Chem- 
istry is a prominent study. . Histology is included among the studies of many medical 
colleges. Special instruction is often given on the structure and diseasesof the eye, the 
ear, and the throat. Inthe medical department of Boston University a professorship of 
the ‘‘history and methodology of the medical sciences’”’ has been established recently. 
“Its work is to define and classify the different sciences which relate to this department, 
to show their history and right relation to each other, to point out the different methods 
of studying and teaching them, and to survey in a critical and practical manner the 
bibliography of each.’’ Of the subjects of medical study mentioned pharmacy and hygiene 
are rarely included in the curriculum of a medical college. Medical jurisprudence is, 
frequehtly omitted. The scheme of tuition adopted by the American Medical College 
Association covers the general topics of anatomy, with dissection, physiology, chemistry, 
materia medica and therapeutics, obstetrics, surgery, pathology and practice of medicine. 
Several medical schools have graded courses of instruction. Thirteen such are known 
to this Office. They are the medical departments of the Universities of California, 
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Denver, Colo.; of Harvard and Syracuse Universities 
and of Yale College; the Chicago, Detroit, and St. Louis Medical Colleges; the Medical 
College of the Pacific; the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania; and the Medico- 
Chirurgical College of Philadelphia. The studies of the first year are usually anatomy, 
physiology, histology, chemistry, and, less frequently, materia medica. Those of the 
second year are pathology, theory, and practice of medicine, therapeutics, and obstetrics. 
Special departments of anatomy and chemistry and of clinical medicine and surgery occupy 
the student in a number of schools. The studies of the third year are theory and prac- 
tice, therapeutics and obstetrics continued, diseases of women and children, surgery,

ophthalmology, otology, mental and nervous diseases, and occasionally dermatology, 
Jaryngology, and medical jurisprudence. Definite information on the nature, extent, and 
effect of the examinations accompanying these graded courses is not easily obtained. 
Most of the schools have an examination the first two years for promotion and the third 
year for a degree. In several the examinations at the end of the first year in histology 
and in special departments of anatomy, physiology, and chemistry are final. The second 
year examinations in these three subjects are usually final, and those in materia medica 
and therapeutics are so occasionally. The chief burdens of examination for a degree are 
postponed until the close of the third year. The adoption of systematic courses of 
instruction has resulted beneficially. The effects of recent changes in the medical depart- 
ment of the University of Pennsylvania, among which is the introduction of a graded 
course, are stated as follows: 
The effect of the change on the composition of the classes and on their proficiency has 
been most gratifying. A much larger proportion of students than under the former sys- 
tem has given evidence of a good previous education, either in colleges or in reputable 
academies. The attention of the classes to study has been marked by increased serious- 
ness and zeal; the annual examinations have steadily improved; the examinations for 
graduation have shown a higher average degree of merit than ever before; and a much 
Jarger proportion of inaugural theses than formerly has given evidence of scientific 
knowledge as well as literary culture. 
CHARACTER OF MEDICAL INSTRUCTION, 
The quality of medical instruction cannot be directly estimated. Each school may 
have advantages not possessed by others. Smaller ones enable pupiis to associate more 
intimately with instructors; larger ones are better supplied with means of illustration 
and opportunities for practical work. There is a general movement towards improved 
methods and systems of teaching. The prominence given to clinical instruction and the 
increased number of graded courses are among the indications of progress. A medical 
writer six years ago described clinical teaching as follows: ‘‘ Once or twice a week, from 
one to five hundred men being congregated in an amphitheatre, the professor lectures 
upon a case brought into the arena, perhaps operates, and when the hour has expired the 
-class is dismissed.’’ Compare with this the opportunities now offered by representative 
schools in leading cities. The Cincinnati College of Medicine and Surgery announces 
thirteen clinics a week, ‘‘as much as any student can observe with profit.’? The Uni- 
versity of Maryland School of Medicine has eight clinics a week continued during both 
the sessions and the interval between them. There is also each day a bedside clinic in 
the hospital, wfth one hour in the dispensary. In the Harvard Medical School daily 
instruction in clinical medicine is given by hospital visits and other exercises. Clinical 
instruction in surgery, during the earlier half of the school year, is divided equally 
between clinical lectures on cases, surgical visits in the hospital wards, and public opera- 
tions, two hours a week being given to each; during the latter half year, clinical lectures 
on cases occupy but one hour a week, while the surgical visits and public operations 
occupy three hours a week. In the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania 
eight hours a week are given to general clinics in the second and third years of the course 
and five hours to special clinics in the third year. The student also has each week dur- 
ing this year two hours’ practice in operative surgery, minor surgery, and bandaging, one 
hour of bedside teaching in both gynecology and practical medicine and in practical 
surgery, and four hours’ instruction in specialties. The schools of New York City may 
be said to average two clinical lectures a day throughout the term. A sufficient num- 
ber of schools has been mentioned to show the prominence given to this branch of 
medical instruction by colleges of acknowledged excellence. 
PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
Progress in medical education arises from united action on the part of the public, the 
profession, and the schools. The public must demand thorough acquaintance with the
-P-A-G-E-195

symptoms and treatment of diseases from the physicians to whom the care of health and 
life is intrusted. The profession must discourage unqualified men in their plans for 
hasty entrance into active practice and refuse to instruct them until they are able to 
understand the subjects they must study. The schools must improve their methods, 
extend their courses, and increase their requirements for admission and graduation. The 
movements in this direction have begun during recent years and are going on. The 
schools have advanced, through the sympathy of the people and the encouragement of 
the profession, until a writer familiar with the movement forward ventures the asser- 
tion that ‘‘a course of instruction which ten years ago was considered amply sufficient 
to enable the brains of Young America to digest the art and a handsome allowance of 
the science of a great profession, a course which received the indorsement of the leading 
men in the country, would now be disclaimed, if not openly despised, by any faculty 
having pretensions to standing.’’ This is perhaps too enthusiastic. A calm and unpreju- 
diced estimate of the relative present condition of education in medical colleges was 
recently given by William W. Green, M. D., president of the Maine Medical Association. 
He said: 
The medical colleges throughout the country have generally lengthened their lecture 
terms and enlarged the curriculum of study and in most cases are doing more thorough 
work. In many the standard for graduation has been raised, and a few require a cer- 
tain amount of preliminary education as a prerequisite for matriculation. Most of the 
colleges have established supplemental courses of instruction under various names, 
which fill out the year, so that the student can, if he chooses, pursue his studies for the 
entire three years in the same institution. * * * It is cause for congratulation and 
honest pride that, as compared with ten or fifteen years ago, better classes of men are 
annually graduated from the schools, and that the general tone and character of the pro- 
fession has much improved and is still improving. 
The report for 1881 of the regents of the University of the State of New York says: 
The most noticeable changes which have been brought about during the past year in 
regard to education have been observed in medical education. It is well known that, in 
common with medical colleges throughout the country, the terms of admission and of 
graduation in most of the medical colleges of this State have been lax and unsatisfactory. 
The regents note with great satisfaction a movement on the part of several of the more 
prominent of these colleges to insist on better preparation for entrance, more strict require- 
ments as to attendance upon the medical instruction, and especially a more rigorous sys- 
tem of examination for graduation. It is gratifying to observe that in those institutions 
which have adopted the more rigorous system there is no indication of a falling off in 
the attendance, but on the contrary a healthy increase. This is an evidence that public 
sentiment is ready to demand a decided advance in the qualifications of those who are 
to be licensed as physicians and an evidence that those seeking to enter this profession 
have no desire to have the road made easy for them, but appreciate every well meant 
effort to give them a better training and a more advantageous start in their careers.

As a means of maintaining the full significance of scholastic honors one of two condi- 
tions should be made a requisite for degrees: (1) aspecial examination, or (2) extended 
research or other worthy achievement in the department of knowledge represented by 
the degree. Our leading institutions insist more and more upon these requirements and 
the relative proportion of honorary degrees decreases from year to year.

  CCII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
It should be noted, however, that the figures for these items are but approximately 
true for the libraries of the country, inasmuch as they do not include the very consider- 
able increase of the 3,647 libraries embraced in the Special Report on Public Libraries 
or the increase of the 270 libraries embraced in the Reports of the Commissioner of 
Education for 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879, and 1880, from the dates thereof to the present 
time. 
The idea that a library is not a luxury but a necessity has become recognized among 
the most intelligent people. It has powerful influence’ which penetrate deeply and 
widely through nearly all classes to refine their tastes and elevate their principles as 
certainly as the organized systems of school instruction, though perhaps less rapidly. 
The general tendency of persons who continue the practice of drawing books from a 
library has been stated by good authority to be a gradually increasing interest in a more 
instructive and improving class of books than that for which they had at first shown a 
preference. A librarian has an opportunity to stimulate and direct this upward tendency, 
and where it is most apparent there is the greatest probability that this opportunity has 
been improved. ‘‘A collection of good books, with a soul to it in the shape of a good 
librarian,’’ says Mr. Justin Winsor, ‘‘becomes a vitalized power among the impulses by 
which the world goes on to improvement.’’ Manifestations of the appreciation of public 
libraries have appeared frequently in statutes providing for their support and protection. 
Not less than twenty States have legislated in their favor during the last decade. Few 
years go by in which some State, previously neglectful of its reading population, does 
not enact a law in the interest of free libraries. The statistics of additional public libra- 
ries previously given show their number and size to be greater this year than in any year 
subsequent to the publication of the special report on libraries in 1876. . In 1880 the 
number of libraries reported was larger, but they contained fewervolumes. The fune- 
tions of public libraries have been summarized by Hon. Mellen Chamberlain, of Boston, 
under the following heads: 
First, in due proportion of funds to answer the requisition of scholars; second, to 
supply sufficient reading for all, and without inquiring too nicely whether that reading 
is merely for amusement or with some vague notion of acquiring useful knowledge; and 
Jastly, that of instruction for the class who are generally pupils in the public schools. 
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT. 
The true aim of public library administration is to make the books in it accessible and 
useful to the greatest number of readers. The time has passed when the preservation 
of a library was the chief end in its economy. Methods of arranging, classifying, num- 
bering, and charging books affect materially the usefulness of any collection, but a dis- 
cussion of them would involve many questions and details that have only a secondary 
bearing on their educational value. These matters have heen brought to a high degree 
of perfection, so that those skilled in them are familiar with excellent plans for conduct- 
ing libraries of any size whatever. Librarians generally hold themselves in readiness to 
render assistance to libraries needing the help of experts. 
The great need of a library, after it is supplied with books, is a qualified librarian. 
It would be difficult to say what are the most essential qualifications. A prime test of 
a librarian’s quality, says Mr. Winsor, ‘‘ is his power to induce an improvement in the 
kind of reading.’”’? Mr. S. S. Green, of the Worcester (Mass.) Free Public Library, men- 
tions courteous disposition, sympathy, cheerfulness, patience, and enthusiasm as quali- 
ties peculiarly desirable in library officers. The following suggestive sentences are from 
the pen of Melvil Dewey, esq., of Boston : : 
The best librarians are no longer men of merely negative virtues. They are positive, 
aggressive characters, standing in the front rank of the educators of their communities, 
side by side with the preachers and the teachers. * * * It is notnow enough that the 
books are cared for properly, are well arranged, are never lost. It is not enough if the 
librarian can readily produce any book asked for. It is not enough that he can, vhen 
 
-P-A-G-E-203

asked, give advice as to the best books in his collection on any given subject. All these 
things are indispensable, but all these are not enough for our ideal. He must see that 
his library contains, as far as possible, the best books on the best subjects, regarding 
carefully the wants of his special community. Then, having the best books, he must 
create among his people, his pupils, a desire to read those books. He must put every 
facility in the way of readers, so that they shall be led on from good to better. He 
must teach them how, after studying their own wants, they may themselves select their 
reading wisely. Such a librarian will find enough who are ready to put themselves 
under his influence and direction, and if competent and enthusiastic he may soon largely 
shape the reading and, through it, the thought of his whole community. 
LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS. 
Much attention is given to the use of libraries in connection with the public schools, 
Once it was the complaint that, though the school and the library stood side by side, no 
bridge stretched from the one to the other. Now librarians and the trustees of libraries 
generally are trying to codperate with teachers and parents in directing into profitable 
channels the reading of children and youth. The younger children are helped to select 
interesting and instructive stories and books of history and travel; older ones are guided 
to the sources of history, the authorities in science, and the finest examples in litera- 
ture. The choice of the books is aided by the acquaintance of the teacher with the 
tastes and capacities of his pupils, the discernment on the part of the librarian of their 
wants and his knowledge of the books that will supply them, and by the increasing 
abilities of readers to choose for themselves. Many circumstances and influences must 
unite in order to produce the highest degree of mutual helpfulness between the school 
and the library. Some of these essentials are mentioned by Mr. W. E. Foster, of Provi- 
dence, as follows: 
On the part of the pupil, then, are requisite a continuous mental development and suf- 
ficient scope of individuality ; on the part of the teacher and librarian are requisite a 
genuine interest in the work and mutual codperation. The choice of methods must aim 
to bring the strongest light of interest to bear on the presentation of each subject, and 
must be essentially direct and personal, and must follow up the first steps of continuous 
efforts. Instead of a policy which contemplates brilliant but .superticial operations 
should be chosen one which, with patience and persistency, enters upon measures which 
require time for their development, but whose results are substantial and permanent. 
A few years ago the trustees of the Quincy (Mass.) Public Library adopted a rule by 
which each of the schools might become practically a branch library, the master 
selecting a number of volumes from the main library and circulating them among his 
scholars. In the Wells School, Boston, a plan has been devised for promoting the study 
of good literature. It involves the loan from the Public Library to the public school of 
copies of some one book sufficient in number to enable the pupils of the school to read 
the same book at the same time. Once a week they are examined in a free conversa- 
tional way as to the structure of the work, the relation of its parts, the spirit in which 
it was written, the excellence of its style and diction, and similar qualities. It is said 
thatafter a few months’ study of ‘‘ Leslie Goldthwaite’s Journal” the pupils ‘‘came to have 
a perception more or less clear, according to the intellectual endowments of individual 
girls, of all those elements by which the professional critic is enabled to give judgment 
upon the value of any novel as a work of art.’? The use of libraries has been greatly 
increased in Cincinnati by interesting public school scholars in authors of unquestioned 
merit. The school district libraries of California are meeting with marked success. It 
is not too much to say that seven-eighths of them are doing good service in the education 
of the people. Mr. Foster has given some excellent rules for the guidance of pupils in 
their use of the public library. They are as follows: 
(1) Begin by basing your reading on your school text books. (2) Learn the proper 
use of reference books. (3) Use books, that you may obtain and express ideas of your 
own. (4) Acquire wholesome habits of reading. (5) Use imaginative literature, but
-P-A-G-E-204
CCIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
not immoderately. (6) Do not try to cover too much ground. (7) Do not hesitate to 
ask for assistance and suggestions at the library. (8) See that you make your reading 
a definite gain to you. 
CATALOGUES AND INDEXES. 
  The practical value of libraries has been enhanced by the skill and industry employed 
in the preparation of catalogues and indexes. This technical and laborious work can be 
accomplished satisfactorily only by persons of talent and experience.. General rules are 
adopted by library associations, and they furnish guidance and tend to secure uniformity 
of entries and arrangement. They have the same purpose and consequently are essen- 
tially alike in matters of substance. The details may depend on the fulness of entries, 
the kind of catalogue, the purposes of the library, and the characteristics of librarians. 
The mental qualities and the facilities possessed by the employés of any library will de- 
termine to a considerable extent the character of the catalogue issued by it. Such a work 
as the subject catalogue of the United States Surgeon General’s Office could not come 
from a library which had inferior officers and ordinary facilities. It may be that some 
system of codperation will be inaugurated by which catalogues for general use will be 
prepared by the combined effort of the men best able to do such work. 
The movements in the line of indexing are attracting much attention. It is now con- 
sidered feasible to index, not individual books only, but those of a class or subject. 
A series of publications entitled the Q. P. Indexes has been received with favor.! The 
earliest of them contain references to the articles which appeared in some single maga- 
zine during a selected period. Later numbers give references to contributions to several 
periodicals during a particular year. An index of articles relating to history, biography, 
literature, and travel contained in essays will be attempted in the near future. In the 
forefront of projects of this kind is the preparation of a greatly extended edition of 
Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature. The work is being done through the codperation 
of leading libraries under the direction of Mr. William F. Poole, of Chicago. He pre- 
seribed rules for indexing and assigned particular magazines to libraries possessing full 
files. The number of serials indexed up to February was 188, comprising 4,318 volumes. 
Mr. Poole said at that time: ° 
The work of more than fifty of the codperating libraries has been sent in, with the 
references to the current serials brought down to January, 1880. The matter has been 
revised by the editors, distributed under the first letter of the headings, and about six 
hundred pages of copy have been arranged for the printers. * * * The arrange- 
ment and revising of the copy we estimate will be completed during the present year, 
and the printing will begin early in 1882 and will be carried on as rapidly as the nature 
of the work will permit. It will make a royal octave volume of about 1,200 pages. 
  
1Phis work has been undertaken by Mr. W. H. Griswold, a graduate of Harvard College, who 
studied two years in Europe and is now assistant to Mr. Spofford, librarian of Congress. His in- 
dexes show honest and well considered work and have received recognition abroad creditable 
to him as well as to the progress of indexing in the United States. The Deutsche Rundschau, in 
an extended notice, observes: 
“The readers of the Deutsche Rundschau will be pleased to learn that an index of its authors and 
subjects has been published. This publication comes from America: Germans are not index makers. 
The work is excellently done and will be of great value to the readers of the Rundschau. Mr. 
Griswold has made similar indexes to several American periodicals. His work shows great in- 
dustry and accuracy. Open it where one may, there is no possibility of mistake. These indexes 
will be exceedingly useful to libraries having the periodicals covered by them,”

The list of nurse training schools has been increased during the year by the opening 
of two schools, one in Chicago and one in New York City. The latter @chool was in 
contemplation as early as 1879. The death of the lady who was most deeply interested 
in its establishment postponed active operations; other ladies, however, soon took up the 
work and made plans for the organization of a school. These plans were approved by 
the Mount Sinai Hospital and a society was incorporated to carry them into effect. Sub- 
scriptions were solicited and $6,410 raised. A house was rented and furnished, that the 
nurses and pupils might have a pleasant home when off duty. The rules of the home 
are few and simple, requiring the inmates to rise and retire at seasonable hours and to 
observe the usages of refined homes. The Mount Sinai Hospital has coéperated with the 
managers of the nurse training school and has opened its wards for the education of 
the pupils. 
Mrs. Thomas Burrows, the recording secretary of the Society of the Illinois Training 
School for Nurses, Chicago, at its first annual meeting, October 1, 1881, gave the follow- 
ing interesting sketch of the origin of the school: 
One year ago to-day sixteen ladies met at the Palmer House for the purpose of organ- 
izing a training school for nurses. These ladies were thoroughly in earnest, believing 
that such aschool was sadly needed, not only for the benefit of the sick, but to furnish 
to those women who desire to become skilled nurses such facilities as would open to 
them a self supporting and honorable profession. Twenty-five ladies were duly elected 
as a board of managers. From this number were elected Mrs. C. B. Lawrence president, 
two vice presidents, a recording and corresponding secretary, and treasurer. A charter 
was obtained, and a constitution and by-laws adopted. The standing committees were 
duly elected, as follows: hospital, household, publication, finance, auditing, executive, 
and nominating, with an advisory board of fifty gentlemen. After it had been fully de- 
cided by the commissioners of Cook County Hospital to give the training school board 
full control of two wards, subject to the existing rules and regulations of the hospital,

the first effort was made to interest the general public in the enterprise. For this pur- 
pose a meeting was called on the evening of the 15th of January in the appellate court 
rooms at the Grand Pacific Hotel. The response was noble and generous, and from+that 
time forward the earnest and heartfelt interest of the people of Chicago was made mani- 
fest in the gift to our training school, by individual donation, of $15,085. Miss M. E. 
Brown, assistant superintendent of the Bellevue Hospital Training School, was so highly 
recommended to us for superintendent that she was engaged, and with great satisfaction 
are we able to say that our expectations in regard to this lady have been more than ful- 
filled. Then came the renting and furnishing the Home, now located at 69 Flournoy 
street, and on May 1 Miss Brown, with her two head nurses and eight pupil nurses, 
assumed their duties in wards A and C of Cook County Hospital. 
The Washington Training School for Nurses held its first regular commencement in 
May last. The society in charge of the school then conferred its certificates upon three 
graduates. Earlier in the year a loan exhibition was held, for the purpose of obtaining 
a fund for the establishmentofa Home. The pecuniary result was not equal to anticipa- 
tions, but the exhibition called attention to the merits of the school and enlisted the 
sympathy and codperation of many citizens. 
Louis L. Seaman, M. D., chief of staff of Charity Hospital, New York City, in his re- 
port for 1881, gives a retrospective view of events bearing on the history of nurse training 
schools. The first publichospital, says Dr. Seaman, was founded in Rome in the fourth cen- 
tury by Fabriola. About the same time another Roman lady, Paula, took up her residence 
in Bethlehem of Judea and assembled around her a community of women who are the pro- 
totypes of modern nurses. Theoldest hospital in existence is the Hétel Dieu, in Paris. It 
was founded in the seventh century and has enrolled on its records the successive orders of 
Sisters that have ministered to the sick within its walls. The Sisters of Charity were or- 
ganized in the seventeenth century, and have contributed much to the relief of suffering. 
The nurse training of this century commenced at Kaiserwerth, a little village on the Rhine, 
near Diisseldorf, in 1836. The establishment there has become known, notso much through 
Pastor Fliedner, its founder, as on account of the attendance of Florence Nightingale, 
who went there in 1851 to perfect her training as a nurse. The term of instruction and 
service at Kaiserwerth was three years, and there was no lack of applicants, though a 
fee was charged for the training. Special recognition of the need of trained nurses w 
made by the ganitary commission during the late civil war, when distinguished phy 
cians and surgeons proposed to educate and drill in a thorough and laborious manner 
one hundred women suited to become efficient nurses in army hospitals. 
An account of the work of missionary nurses, furnished by the superintendent of the 
Woman’s Branch of the New York City Missions, shows the field for philanthropic labor 
open to the nurse. The following extracts are taken from it:    
It is now about five years since a graduate of the Bellevue Training School for Nurses 
gave up her prospect of pecuniary advantage as a private nurse and devoted herself to 
caring for the sick poor in connection with our missionaries, and became the pioneer of 
missionary nurses. Since then that branch of the work has steadily advanced. It has 
increased in favor with rich and poor, increased in power and efficiency, and we wonder 
how we ever did good work withoutit. A part of the last year we employed eight nurses, 
each and all constantly occupied, often far beyond ordinary power of endurance. 
Too much cannot be said of the constant and untiring devotion of these self sacrificing 
workers, who forget fatigue, extreme cold, heat, or storm, when the interests of a patient 
demand their attention. The pressure on them is so great that we are obliged to limit 
their service to day-time and within certain hours. The nurses have made during the 
year over nine thousand visits, carrying relief and comfort to 1,738 patients. * * * 
The nurses have expended for medicines and nourishment $1,172.94, have given 1,251 
garments, and lent for the comfort of the sick 536 articles.

speak, or hear, or see, or from mental deficiency. When these institutions were first 
established they were looked upon as great charities, and the public generally regarded 
them with more interest as means of relief than as schools for the training of young per- 
sons having deficiencies in mind or body. Since that period there hasbeen great progress 
on the part of all communities among us in acknowledging that education for any youth 
who can be benefited by it is not a charity but a right, and that the state in providing 
institutions of this class is not bestowing a charity but discharging a duty, if such a dis- 
tinction may be made. On the other hand, the development of dependence in its various 
forms from disease or feebleness of mind or body has necessitated better provision for 
those suffering in this way; and it has been found alike humane and economical to bring 
such persons together in centres or retreats. These institutions, all will agree, may 
with propriety be called asylums, and those in them designated the asylum class, as it 
is termed in social science. But none need be told how widely all these establishments 
differ from those intended for the instruction and training of the youth of any condition. 
A proper use of terms, then, would suggest the dropping of “‘asylum”’ in connection 
with all schools for these several classes. Another reason for the disuse of this term is 
found in the fact that it suggests to many legislators the idea of making provision only 
for the shelter, food, and clothing of these youth, whereas they can accomplish their 
purpose only by just and proper provisions for carrying on the work of education. A 
careful survey of these institutions will disclose the fact that suffering for lack of proper 
text books, books of reference, maps, or other means of illustrations, or laboratories and 
workshops for industrial training, or persons of a sufficiently high order of qualification. 
as teachers, arises in part at least because estimates of expense are made simply for the 
keeping of so many children. It should never be forgotten that education is the prime 
object in the establishment of these institutions. It may be that in some instances leg- 
islation to alter their designation will be advisable.

A few events of public interest have occurred during the past year among the schools 
for the deaf and dumb. The legislature of Michigan has passed an act reorganizing its 
State institution. The Pennsylvania institution has been named as the recipient of a 
generous legacy, in consequence of which it resolved to establish two additional schools, 
one to be taught by the oral and the other by the manual method. The oral school has 
been organized. A school for deaf-mutes, opened last year at Sioux Falls, Dak., has re-
-P-A-G-E-211
    INSTRUCTION OF DEAF-MUTES. . CCxI 
ceived aid from the city and from the territorial legislature, such as to give it promise 
of a permanent growth. The legislature of Georgia has appropriated $2,500 for fitting . 
up a department in the State institution for colored pupils, and as much more for the 
expense of giving them instruction. It has also permitted the attendance of day 
scholars. The Iowa institution has been given a printing office and has commenced the 
publication of a monthly paper. A gymnasium, by 48 feet in area, has been com- 
pleted and equipped for the Columbia Institution at Washington, D. C. It contains a 
swimming pool and bowling alley on the first floor and approved apparatus on the second 
floor. The Kentucky institution is erecting a chapel and a building for boys at an 
expense of over $40,000, a large part of which has been appropriated by the legislature. 
DAY SCHOOLS FOR DEAF-MUTES. 
There are in several cities schools for deaf-mutes under the control of the municipal 
school authorities. Among them are the Chicago day schools, the Portland (Me.) day 
school, the Horace Mann School at Boston, the St. Louis day school, and the Scranton 
(Pa.) deaf-mute school. The Chicago day schools are five in number and were main- 
tained during the year past at an expense of about $3,800, which was paid from a State 
appropriation of $15,000 made for the purpose in 1879. The pupils numbered 55. The 
average attendance was nearly 81 per cent. of the enrolment, although many of thechil- 
dren lived at considerable distances from the schools. Instruction was given only in the 
most elementary branches. The Portland school is supported by the State, but appro- 
priations to it have been too meagre to allow it to do the work it might. The Hor- 
ace Mann School for the Deaf was established in 1869 for the purpose of affording free 
instruction to the deaf-mute children of Boston and vicinity in such a way that the 
expense to the State would be small‘ and the opportunity be offered children of resid- 
ing at home during the time of instruction. The school occupies a building containing 
eight class rooms, a reception room, and play room. ‘‘And in this cheerful place,’’ says 
Miss M.-G. Morrison, ‘‘in an atmosphere of encouragement and affection, the children 
gladly stay during five hours of the day, while the teachers, who are enthusiasts in their 
work, patiently try to fit them to take their places more equally in the struggle of life.”’ 
In the half year ending July 1, 1881, there were 74 beneficiaries. The sum expended 
for them by the State was $3,524.10. Children not beneficiaries are received and paya 
sum equal to the average cost of tuition. It is designed that the school shall give an 
elementary English education, first imparting to pupils the meaning and use of ordinary 
language. It aims to teach its pupils to speak and to read the speech of others from 
their lips. One teacher is allowed for every ten scholars. The St. Louis school for deaf- 
mutes was opened nearly three years ago. It has two teachers and between forty and 
fifty pupils. The pupils are divided into four classes and pursue studies ranging from 
the most elementary lessons to physical geography, written arithmetic, and United States 
history. The principal of the school, Mr. D. A. Simpson, presents many arguments to 
prove that it is best for deaf children to remain at home during their school days, and 
answers the objections to day schools as follows:* 
The only strong point which opponents of day schools can advance is the difficulty of 
classification of pupils and the large percentage of daily absence from school. To this it 
may be replied that some of the very important advantages which a day school has over 
a State institution more than compensate for this difficulty of classification, and, as to 
absence from school, it is not at all true, as far as the St. Louis day school is concerned, 
that the percentage of daily absence is large. Here, with forty-one pupils enrolled, the 
average daily absences do not often exceed four, less than one from each class. 
Schools similar to those in Chicago have been established in London, and placed by 
the school board under the supervision of Rev. William Stainer. In order to extend their 
benefits, homes have been opened near them for the accommodation of children living at 
adistance. An account of these homes says: 
Mr. Stainer, aided by benevolent friends, has opened at two or three points near the. 
schools ‘‘ladies’ Christian homes,’’ where the children are brought together and provided 
with board and lodgings from Monday until Friday, returning to their homes for Satur- 
day and Sunday. Each home has accommodations for forty children, and they are re-

ceived as young as four years of age. Their parents pay the cost of their food. Besides 
the weekly boarders, there are some children who, having no homes of their own, are 
placed in these establishments as permanent boarders by boards of guardians, the Royal 
Association in Aid of the Deaf and Dumb, and benevolent individuals. The advantage 
of the homes is not only that children living at a distance are brought near to the schools, 
but also that oat of school hours they are surrounded with educational and moral influ- 
ences, while still maintaining their family relations and home ties by weekly visits. 
EARLY INSTRUCTION. 
The education of the deaf-mute child should be comshenced in the home at the earli- 
est practicable moment. He should be encouraged in all active exercises, since they 
occupy his mind and strengthen his body. He should be shown novel and interesting 
objects, that his powers of observation may be quickened and his mind furnished with 
material forthought. The finger alphabet, simple writing and drawing, and the meaning 
of figures may be taught by parents or by older brothers or sisters. Above all, the moral 
education of the child should not be neglected, as his future acquirements depend largely 
upon it. Much is said about the age at which children should be placed in institutions. 
‘The rules of the Michigan school fix nine years as the lowest age at which a child may 
ordinarily be admitted. Children six years old are found in the Clarke Institution at 
Northampton, Massachusetts. The pupils of the Horace Mann School must be over five 
years of age. As the deaf child has more than ordinary difficulties to overcome in ob- 
taining an education, there should be no obstacle placed in the way of his entrance upon 
school life at as early an age as may be deemed advisable, which will vary with the nat- 
ure of the school and the methods of instruction adopted. 
The order in which elementary instruction proceeds ‘in the New York Institution has 
been given recently by its principal, Isaac L. Peet, Lu. D., and it may be taken as an il- 
lustration of the studies by which pupils become prepared for higher work. The first 
step is to enable the pupil to associate an object directly with its name. Objects whose 
names contain many different letters of the alphabet are presented to the eye as soon as 
possible. The second step is to analyze the words and to teach the pupil to make the 
letter of the manual alphabet which corresponds to each letter in the word. The third 
step is for the pupil to learn to write the words. After this comes the introduction of 
sentences which signify that one thing is asserted of another. The different tenses of 
the verb, personal and demonstrative pronouns, and other modifications of words are 
gradually introduced. The intermediary used is the manual alphabet, but semi-mutes 
are allowed none, vocalization being required of them. Gestures and natural signs are 
introduced later, and by their use lectures on morals, government, science, history, &c., 
are given. 
Kindergarten principles have been recognized in the instruction of the deaf. It was 
thought by some that the usefulness of the system would be seriously impaired by the 
omission of the musical part of the exercises; but the success attendant upon its adop- 
tion has been encouraging. 
Mr. Z. F. Westervelt, principal of the Western New York institution, says: 
In our Kindergarten we receive all children under twelve, those who enter at six hav- 
ing six years’ instruction in tliis department. They are constantly under supervision, 
and the manner of instruction is designed to be such as to make all the incidents and 
affairs of daily life educative and to lead the child to learn, by observing. This class 
contains forty pupils, who, in two divisions, are under the care of two teachers during 
the school hours and attended by two nurses while out of school. The little ones spond 
as much time as possible in out-door games and walks, and when in the house are occu- 
pied with games arranged by their teachers for their amusement and instruction. We 
had found it difficult among the games and occupations of the German Kindergarten to 
find those which could be adopted in the instruction of our children; but in trying to 
discover the principles underlying the natural development of the child’s mind—the 
principles upon which Frobel’s system is based —we have been interested and encour- 
aged in working out a plan of our own. 
Kitchen garden lessons have been given to the pupils of the Horace Mann School, ut 
Boston. The report for 1881 says: 
In the early part of the school year, the committee in charge received and accepted a

proposal for a course of kitchen garden lessons, including the loan of necessary appara- 
tus, and the results are highly satisfactory. This instruction was provided by a benevo- 
lent lady (Mrs. Augustus Hemmenway), who had established similar classes in different 
parts of the city. Once a week a class of twenty-four girls was taught by an experienced 
teacher. The opportunity to have the apparatus at the school was of great value to the 
children, who were thus made familiar with the names of household implements and 
with the language associated with their use. As little girls often learn-thoroughly the 
varieties of common sewing by dressing their dolls, so they can learn household avoca- 
tions by handling miniature utensils and articles under skilful direction, and can thus 
acquire early neat and careful ways of doing housework. These twenty-four girls will 
never forget the instruction received to lay tables in the proper way, to sweep and dust. 
rooms, to make beds, and to wash clothes. Their progress in learning the language of 
home life was very marked and was one of the most important results of this course of 
object lessons. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
Cookery has been considered by the officers of several schools a suitable subject of 
study for deaf-mute girls, as preparing them for home life or training them for an 
honorable employment. A course of lessons has been given recently at the North Caro- 
lina Institution by Mrs. Helen Campbell to a class of ten girls. Some of these had 
come from homes where cooking utensils were few and the variety of table dishes ex- 
tremely limited. To them the articles to be cooked and the appointments of the room 
in which the lessons were given were mysteries. The instruction covered only a small 
field and was of the simplest kind. Breadmaking in all its forms and the best cooking 
of meats and ordinary vegetables made up the greater part of the work. At the end 
of a three months’ course the class prepared an excellent supper for the trustees, which 
seemed to convince the most skeptical of the value of the instruction given. 
The introduction of instruction in manual occupations into schools for deaf-mutes is 
advocated by those interested in their education. Four reasons for doing this are given 
by Hon. Samuel Ayres, president of the board of commissioners in charge of the Ken- 
tucky Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, as follows : 
(1) The school term of those who attend closes usually at an age when they are merg- 
ing into manhood and womanhood and should begin to be self dependent. (2) There 
are two or three hours a day, after arranging for study and recreation, that would be 
spent in idleness, and hence unprofitably and hurtfully, unless labor of some kind were 
provided. (3) The regular and systematic exercise so provided, while inculcating indus- 
trious habits, is promotive of health. (4) Mutes find it well nigh impossible to get 
places for learning trades when equally intelligent speaking youths are their competi- 
tors; and even if they could secure such places they would scarcely get the care neces- 
sary for their proper instruction from those who found it difficult to communicate with 
them and point out defects in their work. 
An idea of the shops which some schools have and of the uses to which they are put - 
may be obtained by the following statement about those connected with the West Vir- 
ginia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind. Mr. Covell, the principal, says: 
This department embraces six shops, in which are taught the following branches of 
handicraft, viz, carpentry and cabinet work, shoemaking, tailoring, broom and mattress 
making, chair caning, and printing. To these we may add the girls’ sewing room, in 
which all of the articles of their clothing are made besides the underwear of the boys. 
These shops are now on a substantial footing and are in the hands of skilful, industri- 
ous, and intelligent foremen. The shop hours are from 2 to 5 Pp. M. for the boys and 
from 2 to 4 Pp. M. for the girls. The carpenter and cabinet shop answers all the de- 
mands upon it for necessary repairs to the buildings, fences, school and other furniture, 
besides supplying new tables, desks, &c., for the study rooms, school rooms, and shops. 
The shoe shop furnishes the pupils with good and substantial shoes and fills orders from 
the town and county for every style of work. The tailor shop supplies all the boys with 
one or two uniform suits each session, of a good article of cadet gray, and, so far as time 
will allow, fills orders from parties outside of the institution. The mattress, broom, and 
chair shops are reserved for the special benefit of the blind boys. * * * * * Inthe 
printing office five or six of our brightest deaf-mute boys find full employment as print- 
ers and compositors in general job work or on the columns of their weekly paper, the 
Tablet. The returns from the finished work sold by the shops rather more than cover 
the outlay for material purchased for them, but not to such an extent as to pay more 
than a small per cent. of the wages of the foreman.

  CCXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The Nebraska Institute reports its workshop completed, its printing office in operation, 
and a carpenter shop doing work enough to be self supporting. Baking and confec- 
tionery have been added to the trades taught in the Illinois institution. The business 
has been followed successfully’ by several pupils, and commends itself as being not only a 
good one on general principles, but also an enterprise whose products may be daily used 
in the establishment with which it is connected. Printing is one of the best trades, and 
almost the only one available in schools attended by quite young children. This trade, 
shoemaking, and carpenter and cabinet work are those most commonly taught. The 
report of the New York Institution gives the value of the production of its shops as fol- 
lows: Carpenter shop, $3,479; shoe shop, $3,110; tailor shop, $2,684; printing office, 
$2,312; farm and garden, $4,374. The contract system has been adopted in Indiana and 
is approved by the superintendent of the school. Usually the shops are in charge of 
hired mechanics, who combine teaching and labor. The pupils go out from them quali- 
fied to fill places in shops and factories. Six former pupils of the American Asylum at 
Hartford, Conn., who are employed by a clock company, are reported “‘fully up to the 
average of our employés” and ‘‘ generally very quick to apprehend any sign in reference 
to form or finish of work.’’? Four employed by a firm manufacturing tables and desks 
“Care industrious, quick to learn, and capable workmen.’’ Two young men, weavers, 
and a girl are in a woolen factory. The young men do work which falls short, not in 
quality but in quantity slightly; the girl is up to the average in every respect. 
NATIONAL DEAF-MUTE COLLEGE. 
The education of deaf-mutes is carried to its highest point in this country by the 
National Deaf-Mute College, at Washington, D. C., which was organized as an advanced. 
department of the Columbia Institution for the instruction of the deaf and dumb 
children of persons living in the District of Columbia or belonging to the Army or Navy. 
The college has received generous attention from Congress and has been so provided for 
and conducted that youth from all sections of the country can pursue collegiate studies 
under the instruction of able professors at a small expense. The number of graduates 
exceeds fifty, and several times as many have attended upon a part of the course. Ex- 
cellent work in many varied departments of labor is being done by many of the former 
students. The college course now includes one preparatory and four undergraduate 
years. The studies of the preparatory year are algebra, grammar, English history, and 
Latin; of freshman year, algebra, geometry, Latin (Sallust and Cicero), Greek (optional), 
and general history; of sophomore year, trigonometry, surveying, analytical geometry, 
zodlogy, botany, chemistry, Latin (Virgil), Greek (Iliad, optional), literature; of junior 
year, calculus, mechanics, physics, astronomy, chemistry (qualitative analysis), physiol- 
ogy and hygiene, French, Greek (Demosthenes, optional), history of civilization, com- 
position, logic; and of senior year, literature, German, geology and mineralogy, mental 
and mioral science, zsthetics, political economy, and international law. 
The late President Garfield, a short time before his assassination, paid an eloquent 
tribute to the work of educating deaf-mutes. It was graduation day at the National 
Deaf-Mute College, and, as is the custom, the young men who had completed their course 
had been presented to him by the president of the college. To the address of presenta- 
tion President Garfield replied: a 
I understand, sir, that you are ‘‘presenting”’ these young men to the country. Not 
long ago they were hardly a force or a power to their country. What your institution 
has done for them has made each of them a great power; and that increased power you 
to-day give to the country. Therein is the secret and beneficence of education. 
It was supposed to be a wise saying that one who could make two blades of grass grow 
where only one was growing before was a benefactor. The man or institution that can 
multiply the power of a hoy by three, four, five, ten, or, as you are doing, perhaps a 
hundred, is doing a vastly higher thing than the increase of blades of grass; and this in- 
stitution, which takes a class of the community that the common law, before it had been 
warmed by the sweet charities of modern life, did not regard as citizens—for I believe 
that by the common law a deaf-mute was not considered a responsible person—I say this 
kind of educational work may almost be said to take these unfortunate people and create 
them into the full image of high, broad, and responsible citizenship. Therefore you do,
-P-A-G-E-215
  SCHOOLS FOR THE BLIND. CCxXV 
Mr. President, present these young gentlemen to the country in a much wider sense than 
colleges usually present their graduating class. 
I would like to say another thing: That during these many years of public service I 
have loved to look upon this as a neutral ground, where, from all our political bickerings 
and differences, we come under the white flag of truce that should be raised over every 
school-house and college in the land. I am glad to say that, in spite of all the differ- 
ences of party opinion, we have worked together in trying to make this institution worthy 
of our capital and our people. I am glad to believe that this progress will be unimpeded 
by any changes that may happen at the capital and unchanged by any vicissitudes that 
may happen to the country.

  CCXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Several institutions for the blind have recently lost by death warm friends and sup- 
porters. The Tennessee school has been deprived of a favorite trustee, Samuel Watkins, 
esq., and the Georgia academy of Dr. James Mercer Green, the president of its board of 
trustees since its organization in 1852. Among the items of brighter interest to the 
friends of education for tlie blind may be mentioned a successful series of concerts given 
by members of the Maryland Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, the raising of 
some $37,000 toward providing a generous library for the blind in connection with the 
Perkins Institution at Boston, the appropriation of $10,000 by the legislature of Georgia 
for the establishment of a department for colored persons in its Academy for the Blind, 
and the authorization by the New York legislature of the appointment of a committee 
to select a site and report plans for the organization of a ‘‘State Home for the Blind.” 
ESTABLISHMENT OF SCHOOLS FOR THE BLIND. 
The annual report for 1881 of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for 
the Blind gives an interesting account of the early history of schools for the blind, Mr. 
M. Anagnos, the director, says that the first attempts to educate the blind in America 
were made at Boston under the influence of Dr. John D. Fisher. At a meeting of 
those interested in the subject, heldin February, 1829, this gentleman gave a detailed 
account of the processes employed in European schools to communicate knowledge to 
the blind, described the manufacturing processes by which they obtained a livelihood 
and exhibited specimens of books for their use. A committee was then appointed, and 
through its efforts ‘“The New England Asylum for the Blind’’ was soon after incorpo- 
rated. Two years later Dr. Samuel G. Howe was engaged as superintendent and sent to 
Europe to study institutions, to procure teachers, and to obtain the necessary apparatus 
for the instruction of the blind. Dr. Howe returned the next year and opened a school 
* in his father’s house, which soon gained a firm hold upon the public. Col. Thomas H. 
Perkins gave his mansion house, valued at $25,000, to the enterprise on condition that 
$50,000 be raised otherwise. This was done within a month. Neighboring States, as 
well as Massachusetts, made appropriations for the education of their blind in the school, 
and it was installed in a new home under the most propitious circumstances in Septem- 
ber, 1833, In 1839 it was removed to better quarters in a more healthful location at 
South Boston. 
Literary, musical, and industrial instruction was provided for in the plan of the school. 
In 1840 a department for the employment of pupils who had learned to work but had 
failed to find opportunities was opened. The making, cleansing, and renovating of beds, 
the manufacture of mats and brooms, and cane seating chairs were the occupations chosen. 
In 1850, a new workshop having been erected, the adult blind were removed from the 
main building, which had become crowded, and scattered about the neighborhood, board- 
ing in different families and going to the shop daily like ordinary workmen. They were 
paid monthly wages, usually sufficient for their support. Some years later it was at-_ 
tempted to give aid to blind women similar to that which had been extended to blind 
men. A laundry was opened, but it was abandoned after a trial of five years as imprac- 
ticable. 
The establishment of a school in Boston and the influence of its friends hastened the 
formation of similar establishments in many places in various parts of the country. The 
New York institution for the blind was incorporated in 1831. It was opened the next 
spring. Until 1845 its prosperity was not marked, but became so in that year through 
the appointment of a peculiarly able superintendent, Mr. James F. Chamberlain. Phila- 
delphia was not far behind New York in opening a school for the blind. It was organized 
with great care by Mr. Julius R. Friedlander, who, in his German home, conceived the 
idea of founding such a school in Philadelphia, since he had heard high tribute paid to its 
citizens. After the opening of his school he gave exhibitions of the attainments of his 
pupils before the legislatures of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, and obtained
-P-A-G-E-217
  INSTRUCTION OF THE BLIND. CCXVII 
from them appropriations for the support of beneficiaries. The exhibition of pupils 
seems to have had a convincing effect wpon legislatures and to have been the successful 
method of inducing them to establish schools. Dr. Howe took pupils before the Ohio 
legislature in 1836, and an institution was incorporated the next spring. He madea 
similar exhibition in Richmond, Va., in January, 1838, and au institution for the in- 
struction of deaf-mutes and blind was incorporated in March. The organization of 
schools in Kentucky and South Carolina was effected after like efforts on the part of Dr. 
Howe. At the time of his death in 1876, 27 States had organized schools for the blind 
and others were sending their blind children to existing institutions, thus furnishing 
educational privileges to this class of unfortunates. 
PRINTING FOR THE BLIND. 
The most important recent event in the history of these establishments is the gift of 
Congress by reason of which they receive an annual allowance of books and apparatus. 
The value of the grants for 1881 to the various schools varied from $66.82 to those in 
Alabama and Oregon to $1,033.41 to the New York Institution, or about $4.45 to each 
pupil attending on the first Monday of January, 1880. The books recommended for 
publication in 1882 are Irving’s Sketch Book; Hawthorne’s True Stories; About Old 
Story Tellers, by Donald G. Mitchell; Goldsmith’s Deserted Village and She Stoops to 
Conquer; Thackeray’s English Humorists; chapters from a World of Wonders; Short 
Sketches from English History; Swiss Family Robinson; Principles of Harmony, by Sir 
‘Wm. Gore Ouseley; Our World, a primary geography, by Miss Hall; Perry’s Introduc- 
tion to Political Economy; and Hayden’s Mental Philosophy. The work of the Ameri- 
can Printing House at Louisville, which received the congressional endowment, has in- 
creased so that it requires a building for its separate use. The Kentucky institution, 
with which it has been connected for more than twenty years, wishes to retain it on the 
grounds of the institution. The intention to conform to this desire is expressed in the 
annual report for 1881 of the Printing House, as follows: ° 
“To emphasize the fact that an establishment for printing books for the blind under the 
control of all those engaged in the work of teaching. the blind throughout the United 
States was first founded and maintained for many years by the beneficent action of the 
State of Kentucky, and that it was finally endowed by the General Government in order 
that the great benefits coming from it to the blind of Kentucky might be extended to 
the blind of all the States in-the Union, it has seemed to the trustees of the American 
Printing House for the Blind desirable to erect a building adequate in every way to their 
purposes, and to cost not less than $10,000, in the vicinity of the State School for the 
Blind.’”’ 
I have received recently a letter from Dr. William Moon, of Brighton, England, who 
has become known in this country through his connection with printing for the home use 
of the blind, announcing his intention of visiting this country. In it he gives an ac- 
count of the reasons why he undertook the work of preparing an alphabet for the blind, 
the principles on which it is founded, and the service it has already rendered. The fol- 
lowing is an extract from his letter: 
“Forty-two years of my life have been devoted to the advancement of education among 
the blind. The cause of my attention to this object was my own lossof sight. As soon 
as I became blind, I learned to read by the various systems of embossed type then in use. 
Upon inquiry I found that fewof the adult blind, accustomed to work, could avail them- 
selves of the benefits that several philanthropic and benevolent minds had provided for 
their use. The Roman letters were too complicated, many of them, in consequence of 
the numerous lines rendering the characters too intricate for the touch of the adult. 
“The stenographic systems were equally difficult, owing to the numerous contractions, 
and frequently the same contractions stood for several words; so that the reader often 
had much difficulty in ascertaining which of the words or syllables should be used.
-P-A-G-E-218
CCXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
“* After much prayer and thought upon the subject, I was led to adopt an alphabet, 
which, as far as possible, was the Roman letters simplified; but where this could not be 
done I removed the letter altogether and substituted a more simple character in its stead. 
When the letters of the alphabet were classified, I found that they consisted of 9 char- 
acters only. Books were then printed, and the success of the system was truly marvel- 
lous. I have since adapted the alphabet to 195 languages and dialects. The alphabetis 
doubtless of universal application, since it has answered equally well for all the various 
languages and dialects to which it has been applied. 
“Sixty societies have been formed in Great Britain for sending teachers to the homes of 
the blind and for establishing free lending libraries for their use. Societies and libra- 
ries of this description have been formed in Australia and other countries, and not less 
than 200,000 volumes of our books are thus annually circulated among the blind poor 
free of cost, one of the greatest boons possibly the blind poor ever enjoyed. It is to set 
a scheme of this description on foot in the United States and Canada that I hope to visit 
America in the spring of next year.”’ 
INSTRUCTION OF THE BLIND. 
Though the schools for the blind usually afford instruction in studies commonly found 
in the primary and grammar grades of public schools, the College for the Blind, at Vin- 
ton, Iowa, has a ‘‘senior department,’’ in which there is a three years’ course of advanced 
studies. The branches pursued during the first year are algebra, rhetoric, physiology, 
and zodlogy; during the second year, algebra, chemistry, moral philosophy, civil gov- 
ernment, and American literature; and during the third year, geology, geometry, logic, 
mental philosophy, and English literature. The last report of the college gave the num- 
ber of students in the senior department as 16. The labors of such men as Huber, the 
Swiss naturalist; Thierry, the French historian; and our own Prescott, performed during 
the period of their blindness, prove the possibilities of achieving much in science and lit- 
erature without sight. But it requires teachers of peculiar power and skill to direct 
those who have‘always been blind, or who have become so while very young, in gaining 
a higher education. A recent report says: 
‘The qualifications of a true instructor of the blind are not as often possessed as many 
unacquainted with the work assume. Such an instructor must be one who can clearly 
discern and rightly estimate capacity and tone, who can enter the inner self "of the 
learner, can feel his struggles, and help him to grapple with his difficulties. He must 
hold a profound revetence for humanity, an unswerving faith in the elevation of the 
lowliest, must see in blind boys and girls the divine image, though obscured by igno- 
rance, helplessness, and awkwardness, and must be inspired by the firm conviction that 
they too can be raised to usefulness and can make good their heirship to the grand pos- 
sibilities of the everlasting.’’ 
The quality of the instruction afforded by our institutions for the blind has been fre- 
quently commended. The methods of teaching and government which have endured the 
tests of the ordinary public school have been adopted and modified to suit the peculiar 
necessities of the blind: Occupations which promise means of support to their pupils 
have been tried and careful instruction given in those that have met the demand for a 
suitable and remunerative employment. Departments of music hold a prominent place 
in leading schools, and pupils who have that talent for music with which the sightless are 
often endowed are made skilful teachers and tuners. 
The peculiarity and success of our schools as a body are stated with clearness and can- 
dor by Mr. M. Anagnos, as follows: 
“The most valuable distinctive feature of the American institutions is that they con- 
stitute an integral part of the educational system of the country. Their existence is 
planted in the letter and nourished by the liberal spirit of its fundamental laws. They
-P-A-G-E-219
  
  SCHOOLS FOR THE FEEBLE-MINDED. CCxIxX 
are the creations of justice and equity, and not the offspring of charity and favor. Thus 
the right of the blind to participate in all the educational benefits provided for every 
child in the Commonwealth is acknowledged by the State in its sovereign capacity; and 
since they cannot be taught in the common schools an express provision is made for their 
instruction. This policy has acted very favorably upon the blind. It has strengthened 
their good impulses and fostered in them an upward tendency and noble determination 
to become useful and independent. It has inspired them with self respect and made 
them aim at a higher place in the social scale than they would otherwise have sought.”

The number of feeble-minded persons is such as to invite general attention to their 
wants. The insane are hardly more numerous—in some countries less numerous—and 
their number is more easily ascertained. Insanity is an afiliction that falls upon 
youth and adults. Idiocy is found more often in children, whose infirmity may remain 
undiscovered for several years or end in an early death caused by the invariably attend- 
ant physical weakness. The difficulties of correctly ascertaining the number of feeble- 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
    
CCXxX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
minded are increased by the reluctance of friends and relatives to admit the truth with 
regard to those actually deficient and the impossibility of determining whether certain 
children are or are not feeble-minded. Notwithstanding these obstacles, the census 
enumerators of 1880 reported 76,895 idiots and 91,997 insane in this country. Of the 
insane, 40,942 were in hospitals and asylums; of the idiotic, 2,490 only were in institutions 
for their education and 1,141 in hospitals and asylums for the insane. The expenditures 
of nearly all the schools are reported, and they amount to about one-half only of the 
expenditures of the lunatic asylums of New York. Massachusetts expends over twenty 
dollars. for the insane to one for the feeble-minded. Nearly 40,000 idiots are in States 
which provide no schools for them. This is to be deplored, when it is remembered that a 
small sum paid for the education of the feeble-minded will enable a large proportion of 
them to rise from entire dependence to usefulness, if not to self support. 
CLASSIFICATION AND INSTRUCTION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The object of the majority of the schools for the feeble-minded is to educate such of 
the idiotic class as are capable of improvement. There are many degrees in mental 
deficiency. The commission of medical examiners of the hospitals for the insane of Min- 
nesota says: 
“Tt is customary to divide these children, defective in brain power, into three grades: 
idiots, imbeciles, and feeble-minded. Happily the proportion of the profound type of 
idiocy is small; it is comparatively rare to find a human being absolutely without a spark 
of intelligence. More frequently they are found to possess the undeveloped germs of 
intellect and are capable of some improvement. Ina large number known as imbeciles 
the mental faculties have been developed to a limited extent, and somewhat higher in 
the scale of intellectual endowment we find the most numerous class, known as weak- 
minded.”’ 
The lowest class of idiots are beyond the reach of educational influences. If they are 
allowed to attend the schools for the feehle-minded they impede the strengthening and 
training of those that are improvable and bring the schools an unenviable reputation 
among those who know of them only as a refuge for idiots. The admission of a single 
individual of that class has been followed by applications from the lowest unfortunates 
of the surrounding community and an entire absence of applications from the better 
class. It is necessary for the State to care for even the most hopeless. Pennsylvania 
has acted upon this principle by appropriating $60,000 for the erection of two buildings 
for the shelter and care of two hundred children whose special infirmities, mental and 
physical, are such as to deprive them of the discipline and training of the school 
department of its training school. The directors of the Minnesota Experimental School 
express a desire that it may be merged in a permanent institution ‘‘ comprising both an 
educational department for imbeciles and a custodial department for idiots.’’ The trust- 
ees of the Indiana Asylum and the superintendent of the Illinois Asylum express simi- 
lar ideas. The latter, Dr. C. T. Wilbur, says: 
“For such as these (the absolutely dependent) a place of custody in which there is a 
system in management and the proper appliances and conveniences for easily caring for 
them affords a relief from positive misery and suffering, a degree of comfort; and, at the 
same time, some improvement in the habits which is not alone of service to the indi- 
vidual and a great relief to the average family of the community, or even those in charge 
of the county asylum, but is a positive gain to the productive power of the State.”” 
The feeble-minded that are recognized as proper inmates of training schools are divided 
into classes for educational purposes. In Illinois there are ten divisions. In all, except 
the highest three, individual instruction only is given. The studies of the advanced 
classes include reading, writing, spelling, and the elements of arithmetic and geography.  
-P-A-G-E-221
SCHOOLS FOR THE FEEBLE-MINDED, COxxI 
  The members of the lower classes are taught to obey plain commands and are given 
simple object lessons. The exercises which combine intellectual effort and physical 
activity are being introduced wherever practicable. Larger grounds are desired, that 
the children may not only be removed from curious observers and given greater liberties, 
but also be given labor to perform, to the advantage of themselves and the institution. 
Instruction in farm work is now considered a part of the training which should be given. 
It engages the powers of the infirm children in open-air work which involves small haz- 
ards if mistakes are made, Their industrial and productive capacity is of decided value 
when applied to agricultural operations. It has been thought that boys trained to farm 
work have made the greatest improvement, during school life and have been the most 
serviceable in succeeding years. The pursuit of this industry is comparatively free from 
temptations and degrading influences and affords a pleasing variety of exercise and sur- 
roundings. Other kinds of employment are given feeble-minded children. The report 
for 1880 of the Pennsylvania board of public charities gives the following account of the 
industrial side of the training school : 
The industrial, or manual, department embraces 86 of the inmates. These are vari- 
ously distributed. There are a farm and garden class of ten boys, a laundry class of ten 
girls and six boys, fifteen are engaged in domestic services in the kitchens and dormi- 
tories, one in the carpenter shop, three in the shoe shop, eight or ten in the mattress or 
broom shop. By the utilization of the labor of the many who are able to do light work, 
the expense of their maintenance is much reduced, while the value of manual occupation, 
in the development of intelligence, is conceded to be paramount to all other influences. 
The improvement of pupils in these schools is often rapid. The hindrance to their 
progress is sometimes such that a skilful person can detect and remove it, leaving an 
unobstructed path before them. The president of the board of commissioners having 
charge of the Kentucky Institution for Feeble-Minded Children says that the conduct of 
the institution has been such as to demonstrate ‘‘ conclusively that feeble-minded chil- 
dren, by proper training, can not only be improved mentally, but that the boys can be 
taught useful and profitable trades and the girls can be made good seamstresses, washer- 
women, and cooks, thereby making them useful members of society and raising them 
from positions of degradation, care, and mortification to their friends to be respectable 
citizens.”’ 
% CAUSES OF IDIOCY. 
The investigations of Dr. I. N. Kerlin into the causes of idiocy, referred to in my last 
report, are being continued. Dr. George G. Tarbell, of the Massachusetts school, is mak- 
ing similar inquiries. The results of his investigations respecting 120 children are stated 
as follows: 
It appears that about one-half of the parents are Americans and the other half foreign; 
that in 40 per cent. of the families the parents were of feeble constitution and short 
lived; that the parents of at least 14 per cent. of the children might themselves be 
properly classed among the feeble-minded; that one or both parents of 33 per cent. of 
the children are addicted to drink, and yet that in no case is intemperance admitted by 
the parents to be a cause of the defective condition of the child; and that, while in no 
case is their admission that a living parent is defective, in 20 per cent. of the families 
there is a history of insanity or idiocy or some serious defect in a near relative. In 36 
per cent. of the children belonging to the school, fright, grief, or anxiety of the mothers 
while pregnant is assigned as a cause for the lamentable condition of the child. 
The special agent of the census, Rev. Fred. H. Wines, who had charge of the statis- 
tics of the defective classes, says: ‘‘ We cannot begin too soon nor prosecute too vigorously 
the inquiry into the causes of the prevalence of. these evils ;’’ and the superintendent of 
the Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-Minded Children thinks that ‘‘it would be 
wise State economy to attach to all appropriations for charitable purposes an enabling 
clause that institutions disbursing this charity should contribute to the Commonwealth, 
in as precise form as possible, statistics of the origin of the evils they affect to relieve.’’

The severe criticism of reform schools, the tours of inspection made by committees in 
behalf of reformatory education, and the opening of several new schools are prominent 
events of the current year. The criticism has done much to disarrange and impede the 
schools against which it has been directed; and whatever may be its future results its 
immediate effects have been injurious. It should be remembered that the treatment of 
juvenile delinquents is attended with a multitude of difficulties and imposes a task 
much easier to criticise than to perform. In no case is the critic, any more than the sur- 
geon, warranted in endangering life to remove merely troublesome excrescences. 
Among the committees to inspect reform schools and report results was that appointed 
by the trustees of the Reform School of the District of Columbia, consisting of Hon. 
Richard Joseph and Hon. T. P. Morgan. They visited six establishments, and found 
many commendable features embodied in their organization. Among those particularly 
noticed were efforts to give opportunities for special education in branches for which 
pupils showed great aptitude; instruction in music and the organization of brass bands; 
the general practice of using single beds and separating younger from older inmates; and  
-P-A-G-E-224
    
CCXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
the economy of having boys and girls in the same establishment, so that the labor of the 
girls can be utilized for the general good of the school. 
Reform schools have been organized during the year in Colorado, Kansas, and Michi- 
gan. The school in Colorado receives youth between the ages of seven and sixteen 
from the criminal, incorrigible, vagrant, and truant classes, and such as may be indentured 
by their parents and guardians. The children are separated into families and a system 
of badges and grades is adopted by which good conduct hastens the time of discharge. 
The Kansas State Reform School is placed under the control of the board of trustees of 
State charitable institutions. This body has based the organization and administration 
of the school upon the principles involved in certain propositions, substantially the fol- 
lowing: (1) The distinctive feature of a reform school should be character building; 
(2) it should receive, educate, and discipline neglected, incorrigible, and offending 
youth; (3) its discipline should be that of a well ordered family; (4) the family sys- 
tem is economical and greatly expedites reformatory instruction; (5) restraints should 
be as few as possible; (6) separate institutions should be provided for the sexes; (7) an 
indenture system should be provided; (8) the age of admission should be from eight to 
sixteen years; and (9) commitments should be allowed without formal trial and for an 
indefinite time in case of good" behavior. 
REFORMATORY SYSTEM OF MICHIGAN. 
The opening of a Reform School for Girls at Adrian, Mich., has completed the admi- 
rable system of reformatory institutions existing in that State. The general plan for pre- 
venting crime by educating and providing homes for children liable to peculiarly severe 
temptations, and for correcting juvenile offenders, contains many points of interest. A 
board of commissioners has supervision of charitable, penal, pauper, and reformatory 
institutions. This board has an agent in each county. His duties are to investigate 
charges against youth under sixteen years of age and advise with courts and magistrates 
_ as to the disposition of the accused, to visit all children indentured in his county and 
remove those that have been ill treated from the families in which they have been placed, 
to assist in finding homes for children in State institutions, and to aid and encourage 
persons discharged from reformatory institutions. The institutions to which the agent 
may advise that offenders be committed are the reform schools for boys and girls and the 
State House of Correction and Reformatory. 
The Public School for Dependent Children, Coldwater, is under the control of a special 
board. It has become justly famous for its beneficent purpose, methods, and results. 
Children of from three to fourteen years of age and in destitute circumstances are re- 
ceived into it, to remain until they can be given suitable homes in private families. Dur- 
ing their stay they are kept in families of twenty-five or thirty, each occupying a sepa- 
rate cottage, over which a cultivated woman presides. They are taught, fed, and em- 
ployed in a large central building. The institutional life of the child is, however, made 
as short as possible. The board of control is required to use special diligence to find 
suitable homes for these dependent children, where they will be treated as members of 
the family, allowed the privileges of the public schools, and taught some useful occupa- 
tion. 
The Reform School for Girls has no history as yet. It promises to do the same ex- 
cellent work that other institutions of its kind have been accomplishing, and which is 
presented at some length in subsequent pages. Mrs. S. L. Fuller, president of its board 
of control, makes the following promises for it: 
The girls in our school will sleep in separate bedrooms, which they will be allowed to 
adorn with their own handiwork; have good beds, good wholesome food served regularly 
and appetizingly, good teaching in school and in kitchen; they will have good and well 
fitting clothing, which they will be taught to make themselves; they will be taught in- 
dustrious and cleanly habits, all of which is elevating. The school will be a home, a 
family, where work and games and healthful out-door play and exercise will induce good
-P-A-G-E-225
  REFORM SCHOOLS. j CCXXV 
temper and good spirits. 'The women who will train them will not be thinking of some- 
thing else. To care for these girls will be their business; they will keep their places 
only as they show themselves adapted to the work. The health of the girls will be es- 
pecially cared for. Many of them will undoubtedly be diseased. Heredity, bad cook- 
ing, poor living, iniquitous practices, will have brought them all the ills that flesh is 
heir to. But efforts to cure them will be possible, because all the conditions will tend 
towards eradicating disease. Regular meals, exercise, cleanliness, ventilation, all would 
help to such a result; sound health alone will be reformation. 
The Reform School for Boys is conducted upon the family system principally, and 
receives the usual classes of vicious and offending boys. They are committed for a spec- 
ified term, but may be discharged sooner if such a course seems for the best interest of 
all parties concerned. During their stay they are taught common school branches, but 
no trades. It is hoped that this defect will be remedied. The State House of Correc- 
tion is for male offenders between sixteen and twenty-five years of age and also all per- 
sons duly convicted of a misdemeanor where the imprisonment shall not be less than 
ninety days. No person guilty of crimes involving a life penalty is admitted. The 
inmates are employed in the manufacture of boots and shoes. A day school is main- 
tained. The institution is more penal than reformatory in its character and falls be- 
hind the New York Reformatory, which has the same class of inmates, in its attempts to 
improve condition and character; for the plan of this latter institution includes inde- 
terminate sentences, a system of practical education, and a reward for good behavior in 
an early discharge. : 
These Michigan schools are watched closely by a board of corrections and charities, 
composed of the governor of the State, ex officio, and four members, whose term of service 
is eight years. At least once a year a majority of the board visit the charitable and 
reformatory institutions of the State and investigate thoroughly the condition of the 
inmates and the administration of the establishments. A biennial report is made, which 
includes the acts and investigations of the board and recommendations as to legislation 
affecting the institutions and persons over whom they exercise supervision. 
THE FAMILY SYSTEM. 
Testimony favorable to the family system of conducting reform schools is as abundant 
as in earlier years. This indicates that the plan is founded on correct and practicable 
ideas. Two quotations will suffice to illustrate the high value placed upon the system 
by those who have had opportunity to witness its effects side by side with those of the 
congregate system. The trustees of the State Primary and Reform Schools of Massachu- 
setts make the following statement in their report for the past year : 
The trustees have become convinced that the congregate system, so called, under 
which large numbers are brought together in one building, and this building a prison, is 
a failure. We would call attention to the fact that, while all the troubles and disturb- 
ances and nearly all the escapes have been from the main buildings, the boys living in 
the family houses, leading in many respects family life and under family discipline, have, 
with but few exceptions, been commendable in their behavior, have manifested a good 
spirit, and have not abused the comparative liberty granted them. 
The superintendent of the Connecticut State Reform School says : 
‘The improyement made that we regard as of the greatest importance, and the one in 
which we take a personal pride, is the establishment of a family of boys on the open or 
cottage plan. Our long experience in a school entirely upon that plan, with a success 
perhaps unknown to any other reformatory in the land, has caused us to be deeply wed- 
ded to that system, knowing, as we do, that it possesses agencies for success far superior 
to the congregate or big house plan. 
NEW JERSEY STATE REFORM SCHOOL. 
The New Jersey State Reform School has been organized for about fourteen years. It 
is located on a large farm, so that its pupils have opportunities for out-door labor and 
ey: 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
      CCXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
recreation. The family system was adopted at the opening of the school and has been 
a distinguishing feature of its history. Each family consists of a father, a mother or 
teacher, and about fifty boys. The father works with his boys throughout the hours of 
labor, exercises proper surveillance over them during hours for play, corrects and disci- 
plines them, as o( casion requires, and makes a daily report concerning all. The mother 
has charge of a few boys doing the housework, teaches school three hours a day, is sup- 
plied with the common remedies for use in temporary sickness, and also makes a daily 
report. The families occupy buildings apart from one another and have their own play 
grounds, play rooms, flower gardens, school rooms, and dormitories. Three families 
dine in a large hall; the others, in dining rooms of their own. The members of different 
families mingle somewhat in the different industrial departments, and are gathered in 
chapel for general entertainments and on Sunday for moral and religious instruction. 
The principal industries of the school are farming, brick making, and the manufacture 
of shirts. The income from the farm the past year was $4,629. The number of acres 
devoted to the different crops was: wheat, 65; oats, 25; rye, 30; corn, 75; potatoes, 25; 
roots, 3; and garden, 6. The ploughing, planting, cultivation of crops, the care of stock, 
the teaming, and the miscellaneous work are done by the boys, with only slight aid 
from instructors. The profits of brick making have been considerable. Six and three- 
fourths hours of labor are required daily. Where extra work is done the hoys are paid for 
it; they have earned $847.98 in this way the past year. Amusements have an important 
place in the school. Almost all games whose innocence is unquestioned are allowed. 
Out-door games, like ball and quoits, and in-door games, like dominoes and authors, are 
alike favored. Each boy is given a plat of ground for vegetables, if he wishes it, and is 
encouraged in flower gardening. A brass band furnishes music, and much singing is 
done. Annual excursions have been taken during several years. Escapes are rare and 
the home life of the institution receives high commendations from many visitors. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE REFORMATION OF GIRLS. 
The reformation of boys has attracted attention and received aid more generally than 
similar efforts in behalf of girls. Whatever may have been the reason for this, there no 
longer remains valid ground for argument against the beneficence of institutions for the 
reformation of girls or any reason for refusing to extend support and encouragement to 
them. There are now about a dozen establishments of thiskind. Most of them are sup- 
ported by State appropriation and under State control. Some of the earlier schools were 
maintained by private charity. 
The age at which girls are committed varies from 7 to 18 years. The Wisconsin In- 
dustrial School for Girls has a children’s home into which even the youngest infants 
are received. <A large proportion of the girls committed are 14 years of age. This 
was true of 30 per cent. of those admitted in 1881 to the Wisconsin school, of 26 per cent. 
of those admitted to the Connecticut school, and of 25, 20, and 19 per cent., respectively, 
of those committed to the Indiana, Maryland, and Iowa schools; 32 per cent. of the girls 
committed to the Indiana Reformatory, however, were 13 years of age, and 34 per cent. of 
those committed to the Maryland school were 16 years old. The age at which greatest 
care should ‘be given girls, as faras moral influences are concerned, is shown by these 
figures. ° 
The grounds of commitment to the various institutions are similar. Those recognized 
by the Wisconsin Industrial School include, perhaps, the most important. Omitting the 
provisions relating to admissions to the Children’s Home, they are as follows: 
(1) Viciously inclined girls under 16. * * (2) The stubborn and unruly, who re- 
fuse to obey those who properly have care of them. (3) Truants, vagrants, and beg- 
gars. (4) Those found in circumstances of manifest danger of falling into habits of vice 
and immorality. (5) Those who have committed any offense punishable by fine or im- 
prisonment, or both, other than imprisonment for life.
-P-A-G-E-227
  REFORM SCHOOLS. CCOXXVII 
The condition of the girls committed is of the lowest kind, and the difficulties in the 
way of educating and elevating them are such as to discourage any but enthusiastic be- 
lievers in the possibilities of their redemption. Two quotations, the former from Mrs. 
D. H. Johnson, secretary of the Wisconsin school, the latter from Mrs. H. F. Perry, of 
the New Jersey school, will indicate the deficiencies of newly received girls and the ob- 
stacles in the way of supplying them. Mrs. Johnson says: 
Nearly all the older children sent us come from the lowest dregs of society. Their moral 
sense is blunted by continual contact with vice. They are often untruthful, filthy, and 
vulgar in their habits, having no definite idea of the rights of propriety and oftentimes 
with inherited diseases. It takes years of constant training to reform and elevate them. 
Mrs. Perry says : 
Few can comprehend the mental condition of neglected and demoralized young girls. 
None but those who have made it a long and careful study can know how hard it is to 
bring them into orderly and respectable habits and place them on the level of ordinary 
girls—how hard it is to take into account the inherited defects, the ignorance, the tor- 
por of conscience, the unrest, the weakness and fickleness of will, that characterize so 
many. 
The inmates of reform and industrial schools for girls are detained usually until the 
expiration of a definite sentence, extending generally through the minority of those com- 
mitted or else ‘‘long enough only to bring them to the sense of their wrong doing and 
to admit of that preliminary training in cleanliness and the order and system of respecta- 
ble families which alone can insure their retention in such families.”” The actual time 
required to be spent within the school varies from fifteen months to nearly as many 
years. The average time of detention is three years in Connecticut and about the same 
in several other schools. An exact system of merits and demerits is not necessarily 
adopted in determining the rate and amount of improvement. Fitness to enter a family 
or return home depends on many traits and qualities that can be judged of only by those 
long familiar with their operationand effects; and even the most mature and experienced 
fail at times to correctly estimate the temptations a reformed girl may meet and her 
strength to overcome them. The treatment of girls received into these schools is emi- 
nently humane in nearly every instance. Rumors of ‘‘suffering for the common neces- 
saries of life’? and a crowding of sleeping apartments until ‘‘much sickness has pre- 
vailed’? have come from one State only which has undertaken the education and 
reformation of erring girls. This is a sole exception to the kindness and generosity 
meted out to them. They are generally given a temporary home in a family composed. 
of 30 or 40 of their associates and watched over by an educated and capable woman. 
Sometimes they are congregated in a single large building; sometimes they have dormi- 
tories outside. The true family system is agreed to be the best suited to elevate and 
strengthen them. In it, says Mrs. S. L. Fuller, of Michigan, ‘‘each cottage is a separate 
household, in which the inmates are kept as distinct from those of the other cottages 
as those of one cottage in a town are fre@m another.’? Whether the family system is 
adopted or not, an effort is made to make the girls comfortable by pleasant surroundings, 
agreeable recreations, and the varying of monotony by the celebration of legal and special 
holidays. The aim of the officers of the New Jersey Industrial School is to make it 
“such a home that any parent having a wayward daughter may, with confidence, have 
her committed for reformation with the assurance that her surroundings will be of an 
elevating character.”’ The girls’ department of the Western House of Refuge, Rochester, 
N. Y., is provided with spacious grounds, rendering pleasant out-door recreation possi- 
ble in suitable weather, and has large play rooms and interesting games for in-door 
amusement. The trustees of the Massachusetts reform schools have uttered a caution 
in their last report against an excess of tenderness and pecuniary outlay for those detained 
in such establishments. They say: 
There is no judicious kindness in aceustoming these boys and girls to appliances they 
will complain of missing in the homes to which they are sent, or of making their labor 
in the institutions so easy, by what are called ‘‘modern conveniences,’’ that they will

look with discontent upon surroundings not supplied with them. The day is past, it is 
hoped, when Massachusetts shall spend upon expensive structures for her charitable in- 
stitutions the money which should be saved for the training of her unfortunate children 
in the ways of morality, cleanly living, and honorable labor. 
The educational attainments of those committed are meagre. Their disposition to 
acquire is more often slight than otherwise, but there are many notable exceptions to this 
tule. The common school studies alone are attempted, and the highest of these only 
in rare instances. The school of the Indiana Reformatory has four classes: the lowest 
studies reading, writing, and arithmetic; the next class adds elementary geography; the 
third class continues the studies of the second; and the fourth class has for studies history, 
geography, arithmetic, grammar and physiology. The school sessions occupy ordina- 
rily three or four hours a day, taken more generally from the afternoon. This plan does 
not hinder intellectual progress and enables the institution to avail itself of the labor of 
the girls in the kitchen and laundry, in the care of the building, and in other productive 
occupations. There is not a great variety of employments in which they can be made 
serviceable and by which they may earn a livelihood after discharge. An effort is made 
to instruct them thoroughly in household duties. They are likely to become assistants 
in families and to have homes of their own; consequently this training is of the utmost 
importance. Other industries are attempted. In the girls’ department of the Iowa 
Reform School, in addition to household duties, ‘‘ the girls make all their own clothing, 
knit their own stockings (both cotton and woollen), and during spare moments learn to 
do needlework, fancy crocheting, and the like.’”? The inmates of the Female House of 
Refuge, Maryland, make and mend their wearing apparel. The girls in the Massachu- 
setts Industrial School do light out-door work and some are employed in a hosiery shop. 
These have the opportunity of earning money forthemselves if ambitious to do a moder- 
ate stint. The superintendent says: 
We question the possibility of success in managing and reforming girls without work; 
and by this I mean work of some kind to employ mind as well as body—the same to 
be continuous and hard enough’to make rest and quiet very welcome. 
The rule of the Michigan Reform School for Girls is that ‘‘there must be thorough 
systematic teaching of all domestic industries, which industries shall take precedence 
of trades and be a thorough education in every branch of household work.’? The work 
of the inmates of the Connecticut Industrial School is divided among the homes to which 
they are assigned. The one containing the smallest girls is aided by girls from out- 
side. In the others the housework and plain sewing are done wholly by the inmates. 
Each home, except the one doing the laundry work, sends a number of helpers into the 
custom sewing department and the box shop. The net earnings of this shop during the 
year ending December 1, 1880, were $1,606.52. Mrs. Mary E. Rockwell has expressed. 
forcible and timely thoughts about the kind and amount of industrial training that may 
properly be undertaken by such an establishment as the Wisconsin Industrial School for 
Girls, of which she issuperintendent. The following is a quotation from her latest report: 
Our chief duty is in things of general application and utility. We must assume that 
every girl that comes to us for training is to become a woman, and probably a house- 
keeper, whether she becomes a dressmaker or book-keeper or not. Her first and highest 
need is to have the elements of true womanhood quickened, developed, and energized. 
She must have character and general intelligence first; afterwards technical preparation 
for a particular trade or pursuit, if opportunity remain. The elements of all technical 
knowledge may be taught and very early acquired. Mechanical drawing, practical appli- 
cation of geometry, the principles underlying all mental and physical sciences, the use of 
common tools in all simple mechanical processes, will be of use whatever the position in 
life. Technical training, as strictly defined, may never be to any extent possible for us, 
but we can lay broad and deep foundation stones in principles, habits of observation, 
industry, and manual dexterity. 
The object of the reformatory course is attained when a girl is prepared to enter a pri- 
vate family, do the duties there incumbent on her, and resist the temptations to which 
she may be exposed by her surroundings. The selection of suitable homes requires the
-P-A-G-E-229

exercise of a sound judgment, enlightened by inquiry and experience. In few cases, if 
ang is it considered safe to yield the absolute control of a girl to persons outside the 
inStitution until she has become of age or otherwise completely severed her connection 
with the school. The law of Michigan creating the Reform School for Girls provides 
for the disposition of those whose behavior indicates a fitness for discharge before the 
expiration of their sentence, as follows: 
It shall be lawful for the board of control, whenever in their discretion they may deem 
any of the inmates of said institution to have been so far reformed as to justify her dis- 
charge, to liberate such inmate, or to bind her by articles of indenture to any suitable 
person who will engage to educate said girl and to instruct her in household work or in 
some proper art or trade, or said board may return any such girl to her parents or other 
guardians when they shall have become bound to said board with sufficient sureties for 
her good behavior and care, or said board may place any such girl in the care of any 
resident of this State who is the head of a family and.of good moral character, but on 
such terms as the board may prescribe. 
In Massachusetts the State board of health, lunacy, and charity has paid agents who, 
together with the principal of the State Primary School and unpaid volunteer visitors, 
are charged with the duty of specially investigating homes and families with regard to 
their fitness for the custody of children; and when applications are not sufficiently numer- 
ous they seek out families who will receive and provide for these children in accordance 
with their respective wants. There were in the early part of the year 305 girls to be 
visited.

TABLE XXIII.— EDUCATIONAL BENEFACTIONS. 
The following summary, drawn from Table XXIII of the appendix, exhibits the total 
of donations and legacies by individuals in aid of education, so far as reported to this 
Office, the classes of institutions benefited by the same, and the uses to which the funds 
were to be applied. The total amount reported is $7,440,224, an increase of $2,190,414 
over the same for 1880, and the largest total reported to the Office since 1872. More than 
one-half the whole amount ($4,601,069) was bestowed upon the universities and col- 
leges of liberal arts. Schools of theology come next in the order of beneficiaries, receiv- 
ing $962,535; the schools represented in Table VI received $672,240 and those repre- 
sented in Table VIJ $258, 439, or a total for the two classes of secondary schools of $930,679. 
The claims of science do not seem to be sufficiently regarded by the benefactors of learn- 
ing. It should, however, be observed that the entire amount devoted to this branch of 
knowledge is not comprised in the $177,058 reported for schools of science. The total 
for universities and colleges includes benefactions to departments of science which can- 
not be separated from the general statement.

I.—Evrore. 
AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.—4a, AUSTRIA, constitutional monarchy: Area, 115,903 square miles; population 
(December 31, 1880), 22,144,244. Minister of public instruction, Conrad von Eybesfeld. 
Educational institutions in Austria are divided into elementary (popular or common) 
schools, secondary institutions (Gymnasien and Realschulen), superior institutions (uni- 
versities, higher technical institutions, &c.), and institutions for special education. 
Elementary or common schools, divided into general common schools and burgher or 
city schools, are open toall citizens, without regard to religious belief. The general rule 
is that at least one burgher or city school must exist in every school district. A common 
school, however, must be established wherever in the extent of a league there are 40 
children of school age who have to go more than two and a half miles to reach school. 
Most elementary schools, including many burgher or city schools, receive children of 
both sexes, and are therefore called mixed schools. The teachers and assistant teachers 
of these common schools must obtain certificates of qualification at the teachers’ semi- 
naries. An idea of the scope of instruction in these schools may be gained from the gen- 
eral plan of study prescribed for a burgher school for boys. This plan embraces: (1) Re- 
ligion. (2) German: accurate reading and comprehension of the subject of study; correct 
use of the language and practice in composition; such modern literature as uited to 
the age of the pupils. (3) Geography and history: important features of physical geog- 
raphy, geography in general and of Austria and Hungary in particular. (4) Natural 
history: leading features of the three kingdoms of nature and practical applications; the 
human body and its care. (5) Natural philosophy: elements of physics and chemistry 
with reference to their practical applications. (6) Arithmetic. (7) Geometry and draw 
ing. (8) Free-hand drawing, plane and perspective, with applications to ornamentation 
and modelling. (9) Writing. (10) Singing. (11) Gymnastics. In girls’ schools female 
handiwork and domestic economy are taught. 
As regards secondary education, the institutions of this branch are divided into Gym- 
nasien, Realgymnasien, and Realschulen. The object of the Gymnasium is to afford a 
higher general education (using the ancient classical languages and literature for that pur- 
pose) and at the same time prepare students for the university. The complete Gymnasium 
consists of the upper and lower Gymnasium, of four classes (or annual courses) each, but 
forms an undivided whole under one management. A lower Gymnasium may be regarded 
as a separate institution, because it not only prepares for the upper classes but also

  CCXXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
arranges to a certain extent its course of study so as to fit its pupils for active life. A 
Realgymnasium is a lower Gymnasium, in all the classes of which drawing is obligatory, 
as is also a modern language for those students of the two upper classes who are not to 
enter the upper Gymnasium and are consequently exempted from the study of Greek. A 
Realgymnasium may also be regarded as a complete institution or it may be combined 
with an upper Gymnasium, an upper Realschule, or with both. ‘ 
Realschulen, like Gymnasien, consist of upper and lower schools. The latter fit pupils 
for immediate entrance into practical life or for admission to special schools, and may be 
regarded, like the corresponding grade of Gymnasien, as separate institutions. An upper 
Realschule cannot be so regarded. An idea of the difference in the objects and subject 
matter of instruction in these two classes of schools will be gained from a comparison of 
their plans of studies. The obligatory studies in a Gymnasium are: (1) Religion. (2) 
Latin language. In the lower Gymnasium oral and written exercises in Latin gram- 
mar, exercises in translation (Cornelius Nepos, Cwsar, Bell. Gall.). In the upper Gym- 
nasium Roman literature (Livy, Sallust, Cxsar, Bell. Civ., Cicero’s orations, Tacitus, 
Ovid, Virgil, Horace) and Roman history, study of Latin style and elegances of the lan- 
guage. (3) Greek. Inthe lower Gymnasium, grammar of the Attic dialect; syntax. In 
the upper Gymnasium, thorough reading of the most important Greek authors (Homer, 
Xenophon, Herodotus, Sophocles, Plato, Demosthenes), as far as time allows. (4) Thor- 
ough study of the language of instruction (i. e., German), including acquisition of style, 
history of the language, and study of its literature. (5) Study of some other national 
language. (6) A modern language (in the Realgymnasium), grammar and syntax, and 
translation into and from the language. (7) History and geography. In the lower 
Gymnasium, the earth’s surface and its natural and political divisions, with special atten- 
tion to Austria-Hungary; the most important events and persons in history; chronology. 
In the upper Gymnasium, principal historical events in their practical relations and in 
their dependence upon natural conditions, with special reference to the history of civili- 
zation; historical development of the Greeks and Romans and of Austria-Hungary; prin- 
cipal events of contemporary history. (8) Mathematics. In the lower Gymnasium, arith- 
metic; geometric forms, their principles and relations; instruction given not by strict 
demonstration so much as by methodically conducted inspection. In the upper Gymna- 
sium, elements of algebra and geometry as sciences of strict demonstration. (9) Natural 
history. In the lower Gymnasium, determining by inspection the most characteristic 
types of the three kingdoms of nature. In the upper Gymnasium, systematic survey of 
the three kingdoms of nature. (10) Physics. In the lower Gymnasium, the more easily 
comprehended phenomena and their laws as far as they can be shown by experiment 
without special application of mathematics and the more easily understood practical 
applications. In the upper Gymnasium, scientific demonstration of natural laws, as far 
as elementary mathematics permit, and application to the interpretation of natural phe- 
nomena. (11) Philosophical propeedeutics; supplementing the empirical knowledge of 
the external world by empirical conceptions of the mental world. (12) Free hand draw- 
ing in the Realgymnasium. 
The plan of study for a Realschule is as follows: (1) Religion. (2) Language used in 
instruction (German). In the lower Realschule correct speaking and reading and gram- 
matical writing; syntax. In the upper Realschule practice in writing correctly and 
with attention to style; essays upon subjects familiar to the students; study of German 
literature and biographies of German classical writers. (3) French. In the lower Real- 
schule, grammatical forms and syntax, translation from and into French. In the upper 
Realschule, grammatical forms and syntax, practice in translating from and into French, 
exercises in French composition; practice in speaking French; study of leading French 
authors from the beginning of the seventeenth century. (4) English. In the upper 
Realschule, correct pronunciation, grammatical forms, and syntax, practice in translating 
prose into German, and conversely easy German prose into English. (5) Geography and 
history, substantially the same as in the Gymnasium. (6) Mathematics; principles and
-P-A-G-E-237
  
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES CCXXXVII 
practice of elementary mathematics. (7) Natural history. In the lower Realschule, ac- 
quisition of familiarity with the leading forms of the organic and inorganic worlds, de- 
rived from observation. In the upper Realschule, systematic survey of the animal and 
vegetable kingdoms, based upon their anatomical, physiological, and morphological char- 
acteristics; forms and characteristics of the more important minerals, and principles of 
geology. (8) Physics. Inthe lower Realschule, experimental demonstration of thesimpler 
natural phenomena and their laws, with some reference to their practical application. In 
the upper Realschule, the principal natural phenomena, demonstrated by experiment and 
observation, with calculations (elementary mathematics). (9) Chemistry: demonstra- 
tion of chemical changes by experiment, the conditions of their occurrence, and the 
laws which govern them; the chemical elements and their combinations, with special 
reference to their occurrence in nature and their industrial importance. (10) Geometry 
and geometrical drawing. In the lower Realschule, the principles of geometry in their 
application to geometrical construction; practice in linear drawing. (11) Elements of 
descriptive geometry in the upper Realschule; principles of projection and problems; 
shadows; and drawings of things used in the arts. (12) Free-hand drawing: acquisition 
of dexterity in comprehending and representing technical objects according to the laws of 
perspective ; application to the drawing of ornaments, with attention to style ; drawing 
the human form and face; training of the sense of beauty. (13) Calligraphy. (14) Gym- 
nastics. 
Elementary instruction.— The following statistics are taken from official sources: There 
were in the school year 1880-’81 15,165 public general common schools and 314 burgher 
or city schools, making a total of 15,479. There were also 911 private schools, making 
the whole number of elementary schools 16,390. German was used in 6,797 of the pub- 
lic schools, Bohemian in 3,929, Polish in 1,166, Ruthenian in 1,053, and Italian in 822; 
in a comparatively small number of schools, various other languages were used, and in 
some cases two or more languages were spoken. In the previous year, with a total num- 
per of schools amounting to 16,492, there were 33,827 rooms. Special means for ventila- 
tion were provided for 13,671 of the rooms. In 1880, 5,225 schools had open air gymna- 
siums, 1,007 had gymnasium halls, while instruction in gymnastics was given in 12,260 
schools; 6,936 had school gardens and nurseries and female handiwork was taught in 6,940 
schools. The school libraries numbered 13,136, with 1,656,563 volumes. In the school 
year 1880-’81 instruction in gymnastics was given in 11,234 schools; there were 6,690 
school gardens and 12,596 school libraries. Female handiwork was taught in 6,647 
schools. 
The number of regularly appointed male teachers in 1880 was 27,597, of whom 26,654 
were lay, 778 secular, and 165 belonged to the regular clergy. Classified in respect to 
age, the teaching corps contained 1,219 male persons under 20 years of age, 5,424 between 
21 and 25, 4,548 from 26 to 30, 8,200 from 31 to 40, 3,754 from 41 to 50, 2,766 between 51 
and 60, and 1,686 over 60. In respect to their religious faiths, 24,723 of these teachers 
were Roman Catholics, 1,397 were ‘‘ Greek-United,”’ 665 Evangelical, 2 Armenian-Orien- 
tal, 246 Greek-Oriental, 560 Jews, and 4 belonged to no religious confession. To the 
27,597 male teachers above mentioned should be added 13,325 assistants and teachers of 
religion, not appointed by the school authorities, making a total of 40,922 male teachers 
of all grades from directors to assistant teachers. The total for 1880-’81 was 38,694. 
At the same time the number of regularly appointed female teachers was 6,288, of whom 
4,931 were lay and 1,357 werenuns. As toage, 538 were 20 years old and under, 2,005 from 
21 to 25, 1,350 from 26 to 30, 1,452 from 31 to 40, 632 between 41 and 50, 245 from 51 to

“Greek-United,’’ 59 Evangelicals, 14 Greek-Orientals, 119 Jewesses, and 1 did not belong 
to any confession. Add to the regularly appointed female teachers 4,993 female assistants 
and teachers of manual and other labor, and the total female teaching corps amounts to 
11,281 individuals, which fell to 9,747 in 1880-81. The number of children of school 
age was 1,388,856 boys and 1,355,324 girls, making a total of 2,744,180. Of this number

2,377,624 attended school at the close of the school year, the boys numbering 1,209,040 
and the girls 1,168,584. Arranged with reference to the languages spoken by the chil- 
dren, German takes the lead, with 1,045,358 children, Bohemian, Polish, and Ruthenian 
following in order. The totals for the year 1880-’81 are 2,863,815 children of school age 
and 2,487,496 attending school. Roman Catholic children numbered 1,146,109 boys and 
1,099,817 girls, 2,245,926 in all. Then follow the Evangelical Augsburg Confession, with 
a total of 35,394; the Helvetian, with 15,196; Greek-Oriental, 8,839; other Christian 
faiths, 785; Jews, 71,414; and 70 unassigned. The total number of school weeks was 
727,791, or 44 weeks to a school; in 1,729 instruction was given in general agriculture; in 
2,276 fruit tree culture was taught; silk culture was taught in 449 schools and bee cult- 
ure in 993. There were 3,953 review schools, with a total attendance of 104,310 pupils 
and 141,631 weeks’ schooling during the year. 
In 1880-’81 there were 42 seminaries for male teachers to supply the teaching ‘force of 
the elementary schools, with 7,627 students and 590 instructors, and 23 for females, with 
3,405 students and 349 instructors. 
Secondary instruction.—The number of complete Gymnasien in 1880 was 101; of lower 
Gymnasien, 20; of Realgymnasien, 39; of complete Realschulen, 61; and of lower Real- 
schulen, 21. There were 42 institutions for training male teachers of secondary schools, 
and 26 for females. The total number of teachers for these institutions of secondary 
instruction was 5,361, classified as follows: For complete Gymnasien, 2,177; for lower 
Gymnasien, 178; for Realgymnasien, 661; for complete Realschulen, 1,218; for lower 
Realschulen, 204; for male teachers’ seminaries, 593; and for female teachers’ seminaries, 
330. There were at the same time 36,122 students in the complete Gymnasien, 2,256 in 
the lower Gymnasien, 9,590 in the Realgymnasien, 15,787 in the complete Realschulen, 
2,180 in the lower Realschulen, and 8,397 in the male and 3,600 in the female teachers’ 
seminaries, making a total of 77,932 students. 
Superior instruction.—The total number of institutions for superior education was 68, 
consisting of 7 universities, 6 institutions for superior technical education, 1 agricultural 
academy, 2 mining academies, 6 mercantile academies, 2 art academies, and 44 theological 
seminaries. These institutions had 1,653 instructors, of whom 870 were university pro- 
fessors and assistants, 330 were instructors in the technical institutions, 35 in the agricult- 
ural academy, 27 in the mining academies, 96 in the mercantile academy, 36 in the art 
academy, and 259 in the theological seminaries. The students amounted to 15,527, of 
which total the universities had 9,010, the technical institutions 2,992, the agricultural 
academy 472, the mining academies 169, the mercantile academies 1,226, the art acade- 
mies 396, and the theological seminaries 1,262. 
Special instruction.— Of public and private institutions for special instruction there were 
1,200, of which 52 were merchantile schools, 295 were technical industrial schools, 160 
singing and music schools, 64 schools of agriculture and forestry and their branches, 6 
were mining schools, 4 veterinary schools, 14 schools of midwifery, 5 naval schools, 261 
schools for instruction in female work, and 339 unspecified. In these institutions for 
special instruction there were 5,342 teachers and 75,851 students. The number of superior, 
secondary, and special institutions was therefore 1,578, which, added to the 16,492 ele- 
mentary schools, makes 18,070 as the total number of educational institutions in Austria. 
The number of teachers in the superior, secondary, and special schools was 12,356, and 
there were 52,203 in the elementary schools, making a total teaching force of 64,559 in- 
dividuals. The number of students in the superior, special, and secondary institutions 
was 169,310.

The system of public instruction in Hungary is divided into common schools, com- 
prising elementary, higher common, and burgher schools, and teachers’ seminaries; second- 
ary schools, comprising Gymnasien, Realschulen, higher girls’ schools, and middle school
-P-A-G-E-239
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCXXXIX 
  teachers’ seminaries; superior institutions, including theological seminaries, universities, 
law academies, and polytechnic schools; and institutions for special instruction, viz, the 
central model or normal drawing schools, the national music academy, lower and higher 
industrial and commercial schools, the national dramatic school, and school of midwifery. 
To this class belong also institutions for the deaf and dumb and blind, and institutes 
of art and culture, such as the national museum, picture gallery, museum of industrial 
art, schools of painting, and the new technological museum. The ministry of education 
and religion has general supervision over all these institutions, but the kind and degree 
of this supervision vary considerably. According to the letter of the law the whole sys- 
tem of public education in Hungary is centralized under the control of the ministry, but 
as a matter of fact the power of the minister of public instruction is limited in many 
‘ways. 
All the educational institutions of the country are divided, as far as their management 
is concerned, into those which are purely governmental, into communal, Catholic, schools 
of self governing religious denominations, and private institutions. The governmental, 
Catholic, communal, and private institutes are more or less immediately under the 
supervision and administration of the government or minister of public instruction, 
whose assistants for such purposes are the superior directors of studies (for secondary 
instruction), the common school inspectors, and the directors and principal teachers. 
But the government divides this supervision and management in the case of district 
schools to a great extent with the corresponding school supporting political communes, 
and in private institutions it exercises the right of immediate control and inspection 
only. In institutions of self governing religious denominations the right of government 
supervision is limited in many ways. It is more extended with the common schools of 
these denominations than with their higher institutions. Indeed, the latter are neither 
subject to inspection by government officers nor is the government represented in their 
examinations, and yet they substantially enjoy equal rights with institutions of the same 
character which are directed and supported by the government. Accordingly, besides the 
government and communal school management, there are also denominational school 
administrations in Hungary, the two Greek-Oriental and the three Protestant churches 
enjoying an entirely independent school management. Among Catholics, especially in the 
Gymnasien and the law academies, the ministry has full influence as the representative 
of the apostolic king and protector of the Catholic Church. The government and the 
independent denominations also have independent charge of the training, appointment 
and removal, and pay of the teachers (except in the matter of pensions), and of the 
selection of text books and other material used in teaching. Since the year 1879 the 
Hungarian language is recognized by law as the national language, and instruction in 
that tongue is obligatory in all public common schools without exception, and after 
July 30, 1882, no person can be accepted as a teacher who is not sufficiently acquainted 
with spoken and written Hungarian to be able to teach in that language. Those who 
already hold positions as teachers are required to learn sufficient Hungarian in the time 
specified to use it in their instruction. 
Elementary schools.—Ministerial decrees of special interest in 1880 are one insisting 
upon sanitary precautions in keeping the school buildings, rooms, and outhouses clean 
and in regulating the conduct of the pupils to the sameteffect, and another with reference 
to giving the pupils of the common schools, in districts where the mulberry tree flour- 
ishes, practical instruction in silk culture. The appropriation for common schools in the 
budget of 1880 was 1,666,315 florins, or $676,523. (The number of independent political 
districts in 1880 was 12,814, of which 274, or 2.14 per cent., were without schools. The 
number of common schools at the same time was 15,824, divided as follows:

system comprised in 1880— 
Elementary schools. -- 15, 652 
Higher common schools. 
Burgher or city schools 
  Owing to the polyglot nature of the population, instruction was given in different lan- 
guages; thus Hungarian was used in 7,342 schools; German, in 867; Romanian, in 
2,756; Slovakian, in 1,716; Servian, in 245; Croatian, in 68; Ruthenian, in 393; two 
languages in 2,335; and three languages in 102. 
In the school year 1879-80 the total number of schools, divided as to sex, consisted 
of 823 boys’ schools, 975 girls’ schools, and 14,026 mixed schools. 
The total population of Hungary in 1880 was 13,728,622, and the number of children 
of school age (6-15 years) 2,097,490, or 15.28 per cent. of the population; 1,619,692 of 
these children, or 77.22 per cent., attended school; 1,433,167 scholars of the 1,619,692 
were provided with school books and 186,525 were without them. There were 21,664 
teachers of common schools, or 1.36 teachers toa school. Of the children attending 
school, 1,251,957 attended elementary (including private) schools and 367,735 attended 
the higher common and burgher schools, the review, and middle schools. The school 
year is divided into a winter and summer course, the first extending from September or 
October to Easter and the latter from Easter to the end of June. The number of school 
buildings was 15,824 (including 1,474 rented buildings), containing 21,838 rooms where 
instruction was given, or 1.38 rooms to a building. This shows that the majority of the 
buildings have only one room, in which both sexes are taught. The average number of 
scholars in a room was 74.16. The support of the common schools is derived (1) from 
the school tax, which is 5 per cent. of the direct government tax; (2) from the income of 
the school property and school funds; (3) from the school money and the government 
appropriation; and (4) from regular subscriptions from the political and denominational 
districts and foundations and other indeterminate sources ofrevenue. From these sources 
the total income was as follows:

The amount paid by parents in 1880 for each child sent to the schools was 87 kreutzers 
(35 cents); the average yearly outlay for the education of each child taken from the
-P-A-G-E-241

school income was 6 florins 40 kreutzers, or $2.59. The average pay of regular teachers 
was 389.14 florins ($157.99), and of assistants, 229.65 florins ($93.24). The regular 
teachers are also provided by law with a*house and garden, and the assistants with 
lodgings. 
The higher common schools are designed to finish the education begun in the element- 
ary schools by an additional four years’ course of study intended to fit the pupils for 
practical life as farmers, tradesmen, artisans, &c. There were 71 such schools in Hun- 
gary in the school year 1879-’80, with a total of 322 teachers and assistants and 3,541 
scholars. The average pay of a teacher of these schools was 508 florins ($206.25) and the 
average cost per scholar 64 florins 36 kreutzers ($26). These schools are not in such a 
flourishing condition as the elementary schools, owing to a want of proper appreciation 
of their objects and efforts on the part of the public. The same is true to some extent 
of the other kind of higher common schools— the burgher or city schools —the object 
of which is much the same as that of the highercommon schools. Graduates from these 
schools who desire to pursue scientific or special studies can attend the suitable institu- 
tions. Graduates of these schools are also admitted to the lower grades of the public 
service, such as the railroad, postal and telegraph, customs service, &c. There were in 1880 
101 such schools, with 622 teachers and 8,450 pupils. The averagesalary of the teachers 
was 805 florins 44 kreutzers ($327) and the average cost per scholar was 65 florins 82 
kreutzers ($27), or about the same as the cost in the higher common schools. » 
In 1880 there were 53 teachers’ seminaries for males and 18 for females, with 617 
teachers and 4,333 pupils, of whom 3,050 were males and 1,283 females. There were 
278 institutions for the care and education of young children (Kindergiirten, &c.), in 
the school year 1879-’80, which were attended by 29,782 children in charge of 419 teach- 
ers or guardians. The average expense of these institutions was 764 florins 95 kreutzers 
($310) each. 
The national pension institution for teachers of common schools was established in 
1875, and after six years of its existence was in a very satisfactory condition. At the 
end of 1880 there was a membership of 11,175 male and female teachers. 
Secondary instruction.—Gymnasien: The complete Hungarian Gymnasium — the upper 
Gymnasium—has a course of eight years, and the incomplete Gymnasium has a three, 
four, five, or six years’ course: In 1881 there were 83 Gymnasien of the first and 68 of the 
second class, making 151 in all. They are classified as follows, according to the sources 
of their support:

The ministry of public instruction has the direction of 89 of these Gymnasien, the

Besides the regular studies of the gymnasial programmes, 50.9 per cent. of all the 
Gymnasium students took anextrastudy. Of the graduates from Gymnasien in 1880-’81 
27.8 per cent. selected theology as a profession, 26.7 selected law, 14.4 medicine, 7.8 
philosophy, 2.2 were to devote themselves to technological pursuits, and 21.1 others 
were to become agriculturists, mining officials, diplomats, army oflicers, &c. 
Realschulen.—In the school year 1880-’81 there were in Hungary 26 Realschulen, clas-

The large proportion of Jewish pupils in the Realschulen and Gymnasien is worthy of 
note. While the Jews form only 4.55 per cent. of the population of Hungary, their 
children form 20.9 per cent. of the attendance at the institutions of secondary instruc- 
tion of the country. Extra studies, such as Latin, English, a language of the country 
other than Hungarian, chemical analysis, exercises in natural history, modelling, music, 
stenography, and calligraphy were taken by 63.2 per cent. of the Realschule pupils. Of 
the graduates of these schools, some continued their studies at the university (in phar- 
macy), at the polytechnicum (in engineering, machinery, and architecture) ; some devoted 
themselves to forestry and mining, agriculture, government service (postal and railroad 
service); others entered the army; and the rest went into business or entered upon 
some industrial career. 
There are four public high schools for girls in Hungary. Theage of the pupils is from 
12 to 16 or 18 years, according to the number of courses in the school. The number of 
classes in 1880-81 was 16, of professors 48, and of pupils 506. The largest of these 
schools was opened at Buda-Pesth in 1875, and in 1880-’81 numbered 341 pupils and 17

end of the year instead of the beginning.

teachers. Uf the total 341 pupils, 95 were Roman Catholics, 2 Greek-Oriental, 29 Evan- 
gelical (Augsburg), 12 Evangelical (Helvetian), 2 Unitarians, and 201 Jewesses. 
There are two seminaries for the preparation of teachers of institutions of secondary 
instruction, in which the students, besides receiving a general pedagogical training, are 
taught classical philology, modern philology, geography and history, mathematics and 
physics, and natural history. 2 
Superior instruction.— There are 43 theological seminaries in Hungary, divided as fol- 
Jows: Roman Catholic, 20; Greek Catholic, 4; Greek-Oriental, 4; Evangelical (Augsburg 
Confession), 8; Evangelical (Helvetian), 5; Unitarian, 1; and Jewish, 1. These seminaries 
in 1880—’81 had 154 classes, 261 professors, and 1,794 students. The number of students 
has been on the increase for the last few years. 
There are also 13 law academies with a four years’ course, which had in 1880-81 137 pro- 
fessors and 855 students. The attendance at these academies has diminished recently. 
Hungary possesses two universities, one at Buda-Pesth and one at Klausenburg. The 
establishment of a third was proposed by the minister of public instruction in 1880, but 
the proposition reached no further than a general discussion. 
The university at Buda-Pesth was reorganized in 1780 by the Empress Maria Theresa. 
This university numbered in 1880-’81 64 regular, 6 extraordinary, 10 honorary, and 
9 supplementary: (supplirende) professors, 76 Privatdocenten, and 12 teachers and assist- 
ants. There were during this year 2,879 students, of whom 2,503 were regularly 
matriculated, 195 were extraordinary, and 181 were pharmacists. As to their religious 
beliefs 46.1 per cent. were Roman Catholics, 2.7 per cent. were Greek Catholics, 2.9 per 
cent. Greek-Oriental, 10.5 per cent. Evangelical (Augsburg Confession), 11.7 per cent. 
Evangelical (Helvetian Confession), 0.3 per cent. Unitarians, and 25.2 per cent. were 
Jews. The percentage of persons of these faiths in the total population of the country, 
according to the census of 1880 was: Roman Catholic, 47.2; Greek-Catholic, 10.8; Greek- 
Oriental, 14.1; Evangelical (Augsburg Confession), 8.2; Evangelical (Helvetian Confes- 
sion), 14.7; Unitarians, 0.4; and Jews, 4.6. 
Besides the two universities the Joseph Polytechnicum, with a teaching corps of 57 
persons, gave instruction to 491 students in the scholastic year 1880-’81. The institu- 
tion has three sections, a general and chemical section, the section of engineering and’ 
architecture, and the section of mechanical engineering. 
Industrial and special schools.—There are 152 schools in Hungary where some branch 
of in-door work is taught. In girls’ schools instruction of this nature is given in female 
handiwork in general, and particularly in making clothes, machine sewing, straw work, 
and hat making. Boys are taught straw and reed work, hat and basket making, buhl 
saw work, and bast work. 
A school for secondary industrial instruction was established in Buda-Pesth in the 
autumn of 1879. The object of this school is to educate builders and machinists and 
their assistants, and heads of small factories and workshops. The principal part of the 
instruction is devoted to giving a theoretical knowledge of the various industrial pur- 
suits which form the subjects of study; that is, to studying the nature of the raw material 
used in a given industry, then the methods of working it, and the construction and use 
of the machines and tools used in its fabrication, and finally the character. composition, 
and use of the finished article. Practieal instruction is limited to exercises in acquiring 
manual dexterity. The course is three years, and the pupils must be 14 to 15 years old 
on entering. The first year’s programme includes Hungarian, arithmetic, algebra and 
geometry, physics, chemistry and mineralogy, free hand drawing and modelling, geo- 
metrical drawing and geognosy. German and English are extrastudies. In spare hours, 
physical and chemical experiments are made, and pupils familiarize themselves with the 
tools in the workshop of the institute. In the second and third years, besides the above 
studies, the course includes such special studies as architecture (architectural drawing, 
perspective), machinery (technical mechanics, drawing of details of construction of 
machines), iron working (exercises in the work shop), industrial (inorganic and organic

chemistry with laboratory exercises), wood working, Hungarian metallurgy (with special 
reference to steel manufacture, production of cast iron and steel articles), textile indus- 
try (raw materials and their preparation), chemical technology. This school had 52 pupils 
in the year 1880-’81. There is in Kaschau aschool for instruction in machine industry, 
with a three years’ course somewhat similar to that of the Buda-Pesth school, having an 
attendance of 45 pupils. Hungary possesses 45 mercantile schools, and one mercantile 
academy, with a teaching force of 215 persons (in 1880-’81) and 3,053 pupils. Drawing, 
painting, and sculpture are taught in the national model drawing school, and the indus- 
trial art school, which was opened at Buda-Pesth in November, 1880, gives instruction in 
elementary and descriptive geometry, ornamental and technical drawing, modelling, 
architectural and industrial art styles, and perspective. There are also a national music 
academy anda theatre school, which had an attendance of 103 and 62 pupils, respec- 
tively, in the school year 1880-’81, and 5 schools of midwifery, which granted 213 diplo- 
mas in 1880-81. 
Charitable instruction.— The Royal National Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, at Wait- 
zen, had 61 male and 37 female pupils in the school year 1880-81. . Special stress is laid 
upon teaching the female pupils manual labor pertaining to the household. The stronger 
girls learn machine sewing and knitting, and practise straw and reed plaiting, and the 
most dexterous are also taught ornamental work. The National Jewish Deaf and Dumb 
Institute was established in Buda-Pesth four years ago, and was intended to have a six 
years’ course and receive 200 pupils. There were 54 pupils in 1880-’81. The General 
Deaf and Dumb Institute in Vienna also receives pupils from Hungary supported from 
the Hungarian Jewish school fund. The National Institution for the Blind in Buda-Pesth 
had 83 pupils in 1880-’81. In this institution special attention is paid to instruction in 
music as affording a means for future support to the pupils. The girls are also taught 
female handiwork, &e. . 
Hungary possesses a national museum, consisting of the Széchenyi national library col- 
lections of antiquities, coins, casts, and archeological specimens, a zodlogical section, a 
mineralogical and paleontological section, an ethnographical section, a picture gallery, 
and a botanical section.

  In 1880 there were in Belgium 6 normal schools for male teachers of primary schools, 
with 771 students; 6 normal departments connected with secondary schools, with 610 
students; and 1 adopted normal school, with 76 students. - For female teachers of primary 
schools there were 6 normal schools, with 795 students, and 4 adopted normal schools, 
with 563 pupils. The total number of teachers of primary schools, lay and clerical, in 
1878 was 11,808, divided as follows: In communal schools, 8,202; in private schools sub- 
mitted to inspection, 1,215; private teachers, entirely independent, 2,391. The number 
of primary schools at the same time was 5,729, or 2.22 to each commune and 1. 
1,000 inhabitants. The scholars numbered 687,749, or 12.5 per cent. of the popula- 
tion. There were also 1,129 salles d’asile in that year, attended by 124,031 infants. The . 
number of adult schools was 2,747, with an attendance of 228,563 persons, or 41.4 per 
thousand of population. The ordinary expenses of the primary schools amounted to 
14,981,349.28 francs in 1878. In 1880 out of 49,054 persons who were drawn for service 
in the militia 8,478 could neither read nor write, 2,022 could read, 22,029 could read and 
write, and the remainder of whom record was made possessed a higher degree of educa- 
tion. In 1878 there were also 100 primary schools under the jurisdiction of the depart- 
ment of justice (hospital and prison schools, &c.), with 7,151 scholars. 
In the school year 1880-’81 there were 47 students in the normal schools for aaa 
ary instruction of the lower grade at Nivelles and Bruges, and 38 at the schools of higher 
grade at Liége and Ghent. At the close of 1880 there were 234 secondary schools of all 
kinds in the kingdom, with a total of 18,619 students.

At the universities supported by the state, viz, Ghent and Liége, there were in the 
year 1830-81 656 and 1,161 students, respectively, and at the universities of Brussels and 
Louvain, 1,239 and 1,512 students, respectively. 
There were four veterinary, agricultural, and horticultural schools supported by the 
state in 1831, with an attendance of 222 students; in 1880 169 diplomas and certificates 
of efficiency were granted from these schools. 
During the school year 1879-’80 there were 32 technical industrial schools, with 9,208 
students. To these should be added the School of Industry and Mining at Mons, with 85 
students, and the Superior Commercial Institute at Antwerp, with 137 students, making 
a total of 9,430 students. The total expenses of these schools amounted to 618,545.24 
francs. There were in 1880 58 apprentice workshops, with 1,457 pupils, of whom only 
92 were entirely illiterate.

The secondary schools of Denmark have a six years’ course. The Gymnasien have one 
department for languages and, history and one for mathematics and natural sciences. 
Instruction in the four lower classes is the same, except that students of the Realschule 
department do not study Greek and the Gymnasium students do not learn geometrical 
drawing and natural science. Theschool attendance lasts from the twelfth to the eight- 
eenth year. Besides the Gymnasien there are Realschulen, with a four years’ course, and _ 
these schools are often combined with the four lower classes of the Gymnasium. In the 
Gymnasien French is obligatory and lasts through the six years. German is obligatory 
through the first four years only, after which it is interchangeable with English. In the 
Realschulen three modern languages are obligatory. 
The appropriation for worship and education for the year 1880-’81 was 978,372 crowns 
($262,204). 
No statistics have been received from Denmark later than those published in the Re- 
port for 1879.

  Primary instruciion.— On June 16, 1881, a law was passed making instruction abso- 
lutely free in the public primary schools. The law declares that tuition fees shall be 
abolished in the public primary schools and that the fees for board in the normal schools 
shall also be abolished. Provision was made for meeting the additional expense conse- 
quent upon gratuitous primary instruction by making certain special taxes in the com- 
munes and departments obligatory. The lawincludes among public primary schools the 
communal schools for girls which have been or shall be established in communes of more 
than four hundred persons, salles d’asile (or maternal schools), and the classes interme- 
diate between the salles d’asile and primary schools, called infant classes, comprising 
children of both sexes in charge of female teachers who have certificates of qualification 
for the direction of salles d’asile. The law also provides that no person may occupy the 
position of teacher in primary schools without possessing a certificate of qualification 
for primary instruction. In 1880-’81 there were 74,441 primary schools of all kinds, 
public and private, of which 26,304 were for boys, 30,409 for girls, and 17,728 for both 
sexes together. The public schools numbered 61, of which 49,621 were lay and 
11,906 were in charge of teachers belonging to a religious order (congréganistes). There 
were 122,760 teachers for primary schools, divided as follows: In the public schools, 
44,165 male and 18,635 female secular teachers and 4,923 male and 17,728 female teach-

ers belonging to religious bodies. In the private schools there were 2,303 male secular 
teachers and 5,019 belonging to religious bodies and 8,276 female secular teachers and 
21,711 belonging to religious bodies. The number of children attending the primary 
schools was 5,049,363, of whom 4,079,968 attended the public and 969,395 the private 
schools. The number attending the public schools is made up of 2,314,751 boys and 
1,765,217 girls, while 253,588 boys and 715,807 girls attended the private schools. Classi- 
fying the pupils of the primary schools as to the secular or religious profession of the 
teachers it appears that 2,026,681 boys and 1,007,271 girls attended the public schools with 
secular teachers, 288,070 boys and 757,946 girls attended the public schools with teach- 
ers belonging to religious bodies, while 71,248 boys and 171,782 girls attended the private 
secular schools and 182,340 boys and 544,025 girls attended the schools of the other 
character. As illustrating the condition of affairs the new law had to deal with, the 
statistics show that in the public schools 1,388,534 children were paying pupils, while 
2,691,434 received their education free. At the same time there were 68,321 teachers 
with certificates and 17,130 without. Of the latter, 15,387, or nearly 90 per cent., were 
teachers belonging to some religious order and 12,882 of them were females. In the pri- 
vate schools the proportion was more nearly even, 18,879 having certificates and 18,430 
being without. The number of salles d’asile was 4,870, with 7,451 teachers and 621,177 
children. ‘ 
Five hundred and five thousand four hundred and thirty-four men and 108,043 women 
attended the courses for adults. These courses cost 2,298,233 francs, 699,432 francs of 
which were paid by the state. Of the men attending these courses, 33,845 could not 
read or write on entering and 31,559 could read and not write. Of the women, 8,768 
could neither read nor write and 10,629 could read but not write. 
There: were 25,913 school libraries, with 4,206,173 volumes of all kinds, and 2,348 
pedagogical libraries, with 500,855 volumes. The number of school savings banks had 
increased to 16,494, the number of bank books to 349,219, and the money deposited to 
7,982,811 frances. There were 32,438 members of teachers’? mutual aid societies, and 
the assets of the societies amounted to 3,000,908 francs 90 centimes. 
Secondary instruction.—The law of December 21, 1880, provided for the establishment 
of institutions for the secondary education of girls to be founded by the state, with the 
concurrence of the departments and communes. These institutions, it was provided, 
should be day schools, although boarding schools could be annexed to them at the request 
of the municipal councils, with the consent of the government. They were to be subject 
to the same regulations as the communal colleges. The course of instruction was to 
comprise morals, the French language, reading aloud, and at least one niodern language, 
ancient and modern literature, geography and cosmography, French history, and a review 
of general history, arithmetic, the elements of geometry, of chemistry and physics, and 
of natural history, hygiene, domestic economy, needlework, elements of law, drawing, 
music, gymnastics. Religious instruction was to be given, at the request of parents, by 
ministers of different denominations, in the school buildings out of school hours. These 
teachers were not allowed to reside in the school buildings. They were to be appointed 
by the minister of public instruction. Each school was to be in charge of a directress. 
Entrance and graduation examinations, with diplomas, were to be instituted for the 
pupils of these schools. 
The author of this law was M. Camille Sée. A ministerial decree of July 28, 1881, 
made provision for the erection of schools in accordance with the spirit of this law and 
prepared for the subsequent detailed organization of their government, programmes, &c. 
A law promulgated July 26, 1881, provided for the establishment of a normal school to 
furnish female professors for the secondary schools.

Iititeracy of German recruits.—It appears from the Monatshefte zur Statistik des 
deutschen Reiches that the percentage of illiterates in the recruits of the German army 
and navy is steadily declining, Prussia had 2.33 per cent. in 1880-81; Bavaria, 0.29 per 
cent. ; Saxony, 0.17 per cent.; Wiirttemberg, 0.02 per cent.; the rest of the empire, 0.49 per 
cent. Comparing these figures with those of previous years the decrease is noticeable. 
Thus, in 1875-’76, Prussia’s per cent. of illiterates was 3.19; Bavaria had 1.79 per cent. ; 
Saxony, 0.23 per cent.; Wiirttemberg, 0.02 per cent.; and the rest of the empire, 0.82 per 
cent. For the whole empire the figures are 2.37 per cent. in 1875-’76, against 1.59 per 
cent. in 1880-’81. 
The city of Berlin had 191 public schools of all kinds. at the close of the year 1881. 
These institutions had 1,391 classes for males, 1,076 for females, and 37 mixed, and 
were attended by 69,430 male and 57,920 female students. There were at the same time 
2 Hebrew schools and 90 private schools, attended by 7,434 male and 14,307 female 
scholars. 
The following account of the public schools in Germany was prepared by Mr. Wolfgang 
Schoenle, United States consul at Barmen, Germany, and transmitted to this Bureau by 
the kindness of the Secretary of State. It is published with some slight alterations 
made in consequence of later information: 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN GERMANY. 
The educational system of Germany, being diversified and highly developed, presents 
so many interesting and characteristic features that a few summary sketches of her pub- 
lic schools, and especially of her elementary schools, which correspond to our common 
schools to a certain degree, may prove to be instructive to those devoted to educational 
and literary pursuits in the United States. 
The following observations refer principally to the public schools in Prussia; but, as 
the system of instruction is substantially the same throughout the other German states, 
may hold good for the whole of Germany. 
The public schools in Germany have the double character of municipal and state 
institutions, inasmuch as the~establishment of new schools must be sanctioned and 
- approved by the respective ministers of ecclesiastical affairs and of public instruction. 
The whole educational system in the several states of Germany is placed under the 
chief supervision of these functionaries, and they are to decide, in the last resort, whether 
elementary schools shall be established and conducted as Protestant, or Catholic, or 
Jewish, or so-called simultaneous schools. In the last named schools pupils of different 
denominations receive a common instruction in the ordinary school branches from the same 
teacher, but religious instruction is given in separate rooms, by the ministers of the de- 
nominations to which the parents of the pupils belong. 
Several cases have occurred in Prussia in the last few years where the minister has 
entered his veto against simultaneous schools proposed by communities and insisted 
upon the establishment of sectarian schools. This is especially the case in communities 
where nearly all the population is either Protestant or Catholic. 
The teachers stand in the same relation to the communities.and the state as do the 
public schools. In most cases the nomination of a teacher for a vacancy is left to the 
local school boards, but their nominations have to be ratified by the departmental school 
board to whose jurisdiction the local board belongs. In a few places the appointment 
of the candidate or the transfer of a teacher from one school to another is effected by 
direct decree of the departmental board. The city and town councils are generally in- 
vested with the privilege of nominating candidates for appointment as teachers of the 
higher elementary and burgher schools; the number of individual patrons invested with 
the privilege of nomination is comparatively small. Their appointment is subject to 
the confirmation of the minister of public instruction and of ecclesiastical affairs, and on 
_ entering upon their official duties they have to swear the oath of allegiance to both offi- 
cers, so that they are municipal and government officials at the same time, and as such  
-P-A-G-E-248
CCXLVUI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
they are subject to both municipal and state supervision. The local authorities, how- 
ever, have no right to suspend or dismiss a regularly appointed teacher without the 
: approval of the state authorities. They receive their salaries from the municipal treas- 
uries, and, in case the school budget of the community should prove to be insufiicient, 
the government has to make up the balance of their salaries. 
The teachers of all grades of schools are entitled to a government pension in case of 
physical or mental disability, and pensions to the widows and orphans of all teachers are 
paid from the fuids of various savings institutions established by them for that purpose. 
Sometimes the municipalities make additional provisions for small pensions. 
All teachers are bound to join the teachers’ pension association. The amount of the 
annual pension depends on the number of years in service and the former salary of the 
emeritus. All pensions are paid quarterly in advante. 
    
HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, 
The higher schools in Germany are well adapted to the training of the pupils for their 
future professions and callings, and show a very high standard of mental discipline. 
‘They comprise the Gymnasien, the Progymnasien, the Realgymnasien, the Realprogym- 
nasien, the Oberrealschulen, and the Hohere Biirgerschulen (higher burgher schools). 
The Gymnasien, Realgymnasien, and Oberrealschulen have a nine years’ course, while 
the Progymnasien, Realprogymnasien, and higher burgher schools have only a five or 
six years’ course. 
Of these higher educational institutions I shall attempt to give the mere outlines, while 
I shall enter into a more detailed account of the elementary schools, which are a much 
more important educational factor, as they are the sources for the education of the great 
masses of the people. 
‘The Gymnasien are the preparatory schools for the admission into the universities, and 
are attended by pupils who on entering the universities will devote themselves to the 
study of jurisprudence, medicine, theology, philology, and philosophy; in short, who 
aspire to a professional or governmental career. Much attention is paid to the ancient 
languages, while the modern languages, French and English, are treated rather superfi- 
cially. 
‘The Realgymnasien have a nine years’ course, including Latin, but no Greek. Great 
stress is laid on mathematics, natural sciences, and modern langua ages. The graduates 
of the Realgymnasien are admitted to one university faculty only, , that of philosophy, 
with its numerous departments of natural sciences and modern languages. Asa rule the 
graduates pass from the Realgymnasien to the higher technical schools. 
The higher Realschulen aim at a more practical education, and are generally patron- 
ized by pupils who intend to follow technical, industrial, or mercantile pursuits, or who 
are seeking a training for entrance into suberdinate governmental offices. No ancient 
languages are taught, while French and English form prominent educational branches. 
The instruction in the Gymnasium and the Realgymnasium in Prussia, according to 
the latest decree of the minister of public instruction, is uniform up to the grade ot 
“‘tertia’? (fourth year), when in the Gymnasium the study of Greek is commenced and 
in the Realgymnasium English enters into the schedule of studies. 
The Gewerbeschulen, higher Realschulen, and higher burgher schools have for their 
chief object the training of the pupils for practical business men, artisans, and mechan- 
ies. The classics are entirely excluded from the Gewerbeschulen. French and English 
are much cultivated, and much stress is laid on drawing and instruction in the various 
commercial branches. The graduates of these schools may be admitted into the higher 
technical and industrial schools. 
  ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The elementary schools in larger cities and towns, as a rule, consist of eight classes, and 
children have to attend them from their sixth to their fourteenth r. The regular 
course of study in thesé schools comprises the following subjects: religion, reading, writ- 
ing, common rules of arithmetic, and the rudiments of algebra, the elements of geom- 
etry, history (chiefly Prussian and German), drawing, geography (chiefly extending over 
Prussian and German territory), the elements of physics, and natural history, German 
composition and grammar, and compulsory gymnastics (Turnen). In addition, the girls 
are taught sewing and knitting. 
The school attendance in Germany being compulsory, it would be reasonable to sup- 
pose that the instruction in the elementary schools would be free. Such, however, is 
not the case in every community. To be sure the tuition fees in these schools are very 
moderate and occasionally but nominal, and in some cities no tuition fee whatever is 
charged, as, for instance, in Cologne, Diisseldorf, Elberfeld, and in about 150 other cities     
   
 
-P-A-G-E-249
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, CCXLIX 
and towns in the kingdom. In most of the communities, however, tuition fees are col- 
lected. The rate of these tuition fees in Barmen may serve asan average for large cities. 
In this city 6 marks (equal to $1.43) for the whole year is charged for every pupil. Lib- 
eral allowances and even entire exemption from the payment of the fees are granted to 
the poor. 
The tuition fees are only a small contribution to the school expenses, which must 
he met principally by-municipal taxation. Illustrative of this fact will be the state- 
ment that in the year 1881 the collection of the school money from 38 elementary schools 
in Barmen, attended by 16,286 children, realized but the comparatively small sum of 
52,000 marks, while the total expenses for these schools‘amounted to 427,650 marks dur- 
ing that period, exclusive of new school buildings and repairs. 
The rate of school money is fixed pretty high in the Gymnasien, Realgymnasien, higher 
burgher schools, and the higher female schools, and on that account the children of the 
poor classes are practically excluded from them. 
The following table shows the rate of tuition fees in the different classes in the Gym- 
nasien and Realschulen of the first and second orders: 
Gymnasien and Realschulen of first and second orders. 
Classes. Marks. | U.S. coin. 
$22 85 25.71 28 56 Upper and lower tertia... 3 BL 42 Upper and lower secunda 3 34 28 Upper and lower prima. 34 28 
The annual charge of the tuition fees for the three primary classes, preparatory to the 
admission into Gymnasien and Realschulen, amounts to 84 marks, equal to $20, per pupil. 
The school money for the different classes in the Gewerbeschulen is fixed in the’average 
at 20 per cent. less than in the Gymnasien and Realschulen. To the children of clergy- 
men, teachers, and city officials of the lower grades the tuition fees in the foregoing 
schools are partly or entirely remitted in some localities. 
The salaries of the teachers in the elementary schools are not very high, but the aca- 
demic teachers in the higher schools are comparatively well paid. The salaries of the 
class teachers in the elementary schools, as an average, range from 1,250 to 2,150 marks, 
with small extra allowances for rent. At the head of every such school is placed a prin- 
cipal, whose salary ranges in Barmen from 2,106 to 2,700 marks, with free quarters in the 
school building. These salaries may be considered an average prevailing throughout 
Germany 
GERMAN AND AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS. 
In spite of the strenuous efforts of the more advanced German pedagogues, such as the 
late distinguished Diesterweg, and in spite of the unremitting agitation of the liberal 
and progressive parties to inaugurate a real ‘‘ people’s school,’’Germany still lacks that 
broad and common education which has proved so fruitful of the most beneficial results 
in the United States. In fact, there are no common schools in Germany, in the sense 
of our American common schools, where the high and the low, the rich and the poor, 
the native and the foreign-born, the Protestant, the Catholic, the Jew, the skeptic, and 
the infidel, all alike receive their common instruction. While our children pass from the 
lower grades in the primary schools through the intermediate to the high schools and 
eventually to colleges and universities, the German children of the wealthier classes, as 
a rule, do not attend the ‘‘people’s’’ elementary schools. _ For their special accommo- 
dation the so called ‘‘ Vorschule”’ (school preparatory to the Gymnasium, Realschule, and 
the higher female school) has been organized, where, entirely separated from the children 
of the lower classes, they receive their primary education preparatory to their admis- 
sion into the above mentioned higher educational institutions. Thus at the very thresh- 
old of the public schools the German children are separated, the division between the 
high and the low, the rich and the poor, is defined at the entrance into the school room, 
the foundation for the social grades and ranks rulingin Germany is laid, and the estrange- 
ment between the children of the rich and the governing classes and those of theso called 
‘people’? is brought about. The pupils in the “‘people’s’’ elementary schools look 
with apparent envy and a mixed feeling of submission and vindictiveness at the pupils 
in the higher schools. There is no social intercourse, no common interest, no mutual 
enjoyment, no reciprocal feeling between these young people; they are separated from 
each other from their youth, and remain separated socially for their whole lifetime.

STATISTICS. 
  As the increase of the population in Germany isa rapid and permanent one, the increase 
of the public schools is also a continual one, although the latter does not entirely keep 
pace with the increase of the population. Thus in the seven largest cities of the Prus- 
sian monarchy — Berlin, Breslau, Cologne, Kénigsberg, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Hanover, 
Dantzig—the population has increased from 1871 to 1880 by 506,000 inhabitants, that 
is, by nearly 33 per cent., and a similar list of 23 middle-sized cities shows an advance 
of almost 43 per cent., so that in those 30 cities 1,600 new school classes had to be estab- 
lished within the period of 10.years. 
In the German metropolis, Berlin, with a population of nearly 1,250,000 inhabitants, 
the number of children attending the elementary schools during the year 1880 amounted 
to 98,900, and the appropriations for the pay of the several teachers reached the sum of 
3,466,015 marks. The average number of pupils in the lowest class of the elementary 
schools in Berlin was 40. It advanced in the second and the following classes respec- 
tively to 47, 53, 56, 58, and reached 61 in the sixth class. In several other cities the 
average number is still higher. In the government district of Merseburg, for instance, 
the average number of pupils in 589 classes amounted to 80, and in 161 classes it reached 
even 120 pupils. The following table shows the number of children in Prussia who 
entered the schools either without understanding German or who besides German un- 
derstood a foreign language. This statement has special reference to the northern and 
eastern provinces of the Prussian monarchy. Of these the pupils understood —

Consequently, for more than 400,000 children teachers had to be employed who were 
able to instruct in some one of the above mentioned foreign languages. 
The erection of new school buildings is a continual drain upon the municipal treasuries. 
To show the pressing demand for new school buildings, the province of Schleswig- 
Holstein may serve as a striking illustration. In this province 227 new school build- 
ings had been erected-within the last 6 years. The total expenses for the elementary 
schools in this province amounjed to 6.2 marks per capita in the year 1879, so that the 
disbursements for every pupil were 40.62 marks in the cities and 32.31 marks in the 
country. The largest school district in Prussia is that of Diisseldorf, the schools of 
which number 1,103. In this district the number of fixed positions of teachers has been 
increased by 1,010 within the last 8 years. 
In the whole Prussian monarchy the number of teachers’ positions has been increased 
by 2,324 from 1879 10 1881. There are at present 86,827 teachers. in the elementary 
schoolsin Prussia. The employment of female teachers has considerably increased during 
the last few years. The per cent. of female teachers in the year 1861 was but 5, in 1863, 
6}, and in 1879, 93. Of the above mentioned 86,827 teachers in Prussia 30,042 are females. 
There are at present in Prussia, principally in the eastern provinces of the kingdom, 379 
Jewish teachers. 
The total number of children subject to attendance in the Prussian elementary schools 
in 1880 amounted to 5,503,970, or, after deducting those who were attending the primary 
schools, the Gymnasien, the Realschulen, and the higher female schools or private schools, 
4,815,974; that is, 17.2 per cent. of the total population, which is 27,279,111. There is 
in Prussia, on the average, one teacher for every 446 inhabitants and for every 78 chil- 
dren liable to school attendance. For the instruction of male and female teachers Prussia 
provides 109 seminaries (normal schools), which were attended by 9,892 persons in the year 
1880. In some towns and cities so called ‘‘ Mittelschulen,’’ resembling our intermediate 
schools, have been added to the elementary schools. In these Mittelschulen the course 
of study prescribed for the elementary schools is supplemented by either French or Eng- 
lish and the elementary education is brought up to a certain degree of proficiency. 
The deficiency of male teachers, which was very acutely felt for a few years in Prussia, 
is now almost overcome, and, with a few exceptions, all the fixed teachers’ positions are 
filled. The tax levy for school purposes is in many districts very considerable, and 
amounts to 35 to 45 per cent. of the general tax levy; but, notwithstanding that fact, the  
-P-A-G-E-251

continual increase of the German population is to be followed by the continual increase 
of additional school classes and the erection of new school buildings. 
The question how the burden of the ever increasing school expenses may be taken off 
the shoulders of the commnunities is now seriously engaging the fertile mind of the im- 
perial chancellor, and he is working out a plan by which a sufficient share of the import. 
duties, levied by the imperial government, may be turned over to the communities, so as. 
to enable them to diminish the local tax levies for the support of the public schools.

The following information regarding elementary education is compiled from the report 
of the committee of council on education, signed by Lord Spencer and Mr. Mundella, 
for the year ending August 31, 1881: 
Day schools—Number of schools inspected, 18,062; number of certificated teachers, 
33,562, with a large number of assistants and pupil teachers; accommodation for 
4,389,633 scholars; enrolled, 4,045,362; average daily attendance, 2,863,535; present on 
day of inspector’s ‘visit, 3,372,999; qualified by attendance for examination, 2,775,150; 
presented for examination, 2,615,911, viz, 620,213 infants (i. e., under 7 years of age) 
for collective and 1,995,698 (7 and above) for individual examination; of these last, 
1,264,121 passed the prescribed test without failure in any one of the three subjects ; 
government grant to elementary day schools, 2,247,5071. as against 2,130,0097. in 1880. 
Night schools. Number examined, 1,222; average attendance, 39,222. 
Training colleges. —Number, 41; attendance, 3,116. 
Expenditure.— Total from government grant, 2,614,883. 13s. 6d. _ Cost of maintenance 
of day and night schools, 5,336,9791. 
School accommodation.—From an analysis of data presented in the report it appears that 
5,268,089 may be taken as the number of children between 3 and 13 years of age for 
whom elementary education should be provided and 3,687,662 the number who should 
be under daily instruction. Whence it follows that more than a million of names have 
still to be added to the number already borne on the registers of inspected schools. 
Standards of ecamination.— The table setting forth the results of the examinations shows 
that out of 1,995,698 scholars examined 1,011,208 were over 10 years of age and ought 
therefore to have been presented in standards 4 to 6; only 527,436 were so presented, 
while 483,772 (or 47.84 per cent.) were presented in standards suited for children of 
7, 8, and 9 years of age. 
There has been, however, a gradual improvement in this respect, which is attributed 
partly to the more regular attendance and increased proficiency of the children between 
5 and 10 years of age and partly to the greater attention paid by teachers to the progress 
of individual scholars, in consequence of a provision of the code which makes the pay- 
ment of certain grants depend upon the proportion of scholars examined in the three 
upper standards. That proportion has risen from 19.98 in 1875 to 26.83 per cent. in the 
past year. 
In domestic economy, drill, cookery, &c., 55,993 girls were examined during the year, 
and military drill is systematically taught to the boys of 1,172 day schools. Cookery is 
taught in 299 schools, or in 23 more schools than in 1880. Savings banks have been 
established in 1,187 and school libraries in 2,382 schools. In 26,290 departments of, 
schools in which singing is taught the instruction is given by ear in 22,151, or 84.26 per 
cent. 
Trained teachers.—The extent to which the training colleges have contributed to the 
existing supply of efficient teachers in England and Wales is shown by the fact that, of 
14,197 masters employed in schools reported on in 1880-’81, 8,632, or 60.8 per cent., had. 
been trained for two years; 1,083, or 7.63 per cent., for one year; and 259, or 1.82 per 
cent., for less than one year; while 4,223, or 29.75 per cent., were untrained. In like 
manner, of 19,365 schoolmistresses, 8,563, or 44.22 per cent., had been trained for two

  CCLII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
years; 1,035, or 5.34 per cent., for one year; 216, or 1.12 per cent., for less than one 
year; and 9,551, or 49.32 per cent., were untrained. Of the teachers, however, who, 
from whatever cause, have not attended a training college, a considerable proportion 
cannot, except in a technical sense of the word; be classed as untrained, having, under 
the superintendence of some of the, best teachers, passed through the pupil teachers’ 
course and served as assistants in large schools before passing the examination for a cer- 
tificate and undertaking independent charges. 
A considerable number of teachers who have not passed through the training colleges 
will always be required for service in the small schools throughout the country. Mr. 
Sharpe, the inspector of the colleges for masters, stated in his report for 1880: 
The training colleges for masters do not supply the demand of the poorer class of 
schools ; they practically supply the demand only of those schools which can afford to 
pay about 1007.—about $500—a year for head or assistant teachers. 
Salaries.— The average salary of a certificated master, which in 1870 was 95/. 12s. 9d., 
is now 1201. 16s. 1d.; that of a school mistress was 57/. 16s. 5d. in 1870, and is now 
721. 103. 4d. In addition to their other emoluments, 6,183 out of 13,694 masters and 
5,636 out of 18,670 mistresses are provided with residences free of rent. These aver- 
ages are calculated upon the whole of the teachers, whether principal or assistant. 
Inereasing proportion of female teachers.—Attention is drawn to the great and increas- 
ing proportion of female teachers now employed in elementary schools. 
The number of female pupil teachers in 1869 was 7,273; they now number 20,476, an 
increase of nearly 182 percent. The male pupil teachers, who numbered 5,569 in 1869, 
have increased to 9,846, or about 77 per cent. 
Pensions.— The education depirtment has received during the school year 96 applica- 
tions on behalf of three teachers in England and Wales, and has awarded 4 pensions of 
251. and 3 of 20/., together with 11 gratuities'to the amount of 3307. Since the practice of 
granting pensions was resumed in 1875, the department has dealt with 533 English ap- 
plications. There are at present 270 teachers to whom pensions have been granted in 
England and Scotland, of whom 20 have 30/., 100 have 25/., and 150 have 20/. a year. 
‘The full number of pensions allowed to be borne on the estimates has therefore been 
filled up. ; Z 
Progress from 1870 to 1881, inclusive.— The dates of the first and third educational acts, 
1870 and 1876, form convenient points of departure for the study of the school statistics 
from 1870 to 1881. The increase of the population in England and Wales from 1876 to 
1831, inclusive, according to estimates in the report of the education department, was 
1,811,396, or 7.4 per cent. 
For the same period the school statistics show increases as follows: 
Tnerease in number of inspected schools in general =) 3/828

For the same period there was decrease in the number of night departments and in 
their average attendance. Wher in 1869, or before the passage of the education act 
of 1870, there was school accommodation for 8.34 per cent. of the population, in 1881 
there was accommodation in aided schools for 16.85 per cent. of the population. The 
more nearly the accommodation approaches that required by the school population, the 
less the annual increase; progress is somewhat retarded by the nature of the effort re- 
quired as the system advances. The act of 1876, it will be remembered, was especially 
directed to securing the fulfilment of the obligation resting upon parents and guardians 
with reference to provision made by the acts of 1870 and 1873 for the education of chil-

dren and to extending the provision to neglected or vagrant children. It is in the latter 
endeavor that the most serious difficulties in respect to the location of buildings, regu- 
larity of attendance, and results upon which depend the grants in aid are encountered. 
All the schools reported in 1870 were voluntary. From 1870 to 1876, inclusive, the 
number of these increased by 4,396, and during the same time 1,596 board schools were 
established. 
In the second period, 1876 to 1881, the number of voluntary schools increased by 
1,693; the number of board schools, by 2,096. Since.the passage of the act of 1870, 
additional accommodation has been provided in aided schools to the extent of 2,623,689 
seats, viz, in voluntary schools, 1,429,421; in board schools, 1,194,268. So far as the 
reports afford data for comparison it appears that the expenditure and the grant earned 
per scholar in average attendance are higher in board than in voluntary schools. 
As day schools multiply, the number of night schools diminishes, while the propor- 
tion of their pupils in the higher standards increases. 
Education in London.—The following information is derived from the annual address 
of Mr. Edward North Buxton, chairman of the school board for London, and from reports 
of the committees: 
In estimating the number of children for whom school accommodation is required, 
the committee adopt as a basis the national census taken in the spring of 1881. They 
conclude that the total number of children between 3 and 13 to be provided for is 685,240, 
to which must be added nearly 70,000 between 13 and 14, who now fall under the opera- 
tion of the by-laws. The existing provision in all efficient schools is 502,095, leaving a 
great deficiency still to be met. 
London maintains supremacy over the rest of the couptry in the proportionate number 
of children who pass in the three R’s. The percentage of passes for the year is as follows: 
      
  | Reading. | Writing. | Arithmetic. 
ses =a | | 
In all schools in England and Wale: 88. 25 | 80, 44 | 74.9, 
In London board schools..... 99.3 | 87.3 83.3 
  
In 1878 less ‘than one in five of the children attained to the fourth and higher stand- 
ards. This proportion has risen nearly to one in three. 
The average gross annual cost per child on the average attendance in London board 
schools for 1881 was 2/. 17s. 1d., less by 2s. 2d. than in 1880. The gross annual expendi- 
ture for the year ending March 25, 1881, was 1,235,3607. 9s. 3d. The average salary of 
adult teachers was, for men, 144/.; for women, 1081. 
There are 49 scholarships at the disposal of the board, 29 for boys and 20 for girls, which 
enable the holders to enter some one of the great public schools of the country. 
The average attendance at board schools is 203,334, and at voluntary schools 178,518. 
The percentage of average attendance upon enrolment in board schools is 80.4. 
Singing by note is taught in all the schools, a special instructor being employed to 
supervise the work. 
The drill instructor reported favorably upon the system of physical exercises employed, © 
especially as conducted in the boys’ schools. 
The total number of girls receiving instruction in cookery in the board schools for the 
half year ending September, 1881, was 4,250. Needlework is obligatory in the girls’ 
department, and a grant is allowed where the same instruction is given to boys. 
The report of the superintendent of the instruction of the deaf and dumb gives 146 as 
the number of children instructed at the various centres, with an average attendance of 
110; progress has been made in the use of the oral system. 
Classes for the blind were maintained in 30 schools; number of blind pupils, 87. 
The superintendent of method in infants’ schools maintains classes for the instruction

of teachers in the Kindergarten system, and visits schools in which it has been imtro- 
duced. The demand for increased provision for this work, and in general for the better 
conduct of the infant department, is emphasized in the report. 
In accordance with the act extending the power conferred by the industrial schools 
act of 1866 to school boards, the London board have established three industrial schools 
and have 840 places reserved for their use in schools under voluntary management. In 
these schools, which are designed for vagrant, destitute, or unruly children under 14 
years of age, industrial training is combined with elementary education. The London 
board have provided for 3,078 children in industrial schools. . 
The result of a wide application of the industrial schools act in London is shown in 
the steady reduction of juvenile crime since 1870; the number of commitments in that 
year were, for boys, 8,619, and for girls, 1,379; for the current year the numbers were 
4,786 and 793, respectively. 
b. ScoTLAND: Population, 3,735,573. Capital, Edinburgh; population, 236,002. 
The following summary is compiled from the report of the committee of council on 
education in Scotland for 1881, being the ninth annual report of proceedings under the 
education act of 1872: 
Day schools. —Number of schools inspected, 3,074; number of certificated teachers, 5,544, 
with a large number of assistants and pupil teachers; accommodation for 612,483 scholars; 
enrolled, 544,982; average daily attendance, 409,966; present on day of inspector’s visit, 
475,021; qualified by attendance for examination, 400,409; presented for examination, 
362,642; viz, 51,414 (under 7 years of age) for collective and 311,228 (7 and.above) for 
individual examination; of these last, 233,062 passed the prescribed test without failure 
in any one of the three subjects. Government grant toelementary day schools, 359,903/. 
as against 347,232/. in 1880. i 
Night schools.— Number examined, 249; average attendance, 13,082. 
Training colleges.— Number, 7; attendance, 857; total government grant, 454,997/. 
8s. 9d.; cost of maintenance of day and night schools, 862,774. 
School attendance.— The enforcement of school attendance is intrusted to the school 
boards. Some dissatisfaction is expressed with the manner in which this obligation is 
discharged, the reports for the year showing that the increase in average attendance has 
not done more than keep pace with that of the population generally. 
The education of the poorer classes is largely promoted by the aid given by the paro- 
chial authorities to pauper and poor parents to enable them to pay the whole or part of 
the school fees. The expenditure from the poor funds on account of education, exclu- 
sive of the amounts paid in industrial schools, deaf and dumb institutions, &c., was for 
the year, 23,4961. 7s. 03d. The extension of school provision to the poor has been greatly 
promoted by the act of 1878 making it the duty of school boards to pay the fees for those 
children for whom no other provision exists. 
Standards of examinations.—From the table showing the results of examinations it 
appears that, whereas, out of 311,228 scholars examined, as many as 159,895, being over 
10 years of age, ought to have been presented in standards 4 to 6, only 109,395 (or 68.42 
per cent.) were so presented, while the remaining 50,500 were presented in standards suited 
for children of 7, 8, and 9 years of age. 
The report states that there has been a gradual improvement in this respect, which is 
believed to be mainly due to the provision of the code which makes the payment of 
certain grants depend upon the proportion of scholars examined in the three upper stand- 
ards. That proportion has risen from 18.77 in 1875 to 36.13 per cent. in the past year. 
Domestic economy.—Of the 24,204 girls examined in domestic economy, 13,281 passed 
in both branches, 3,962 in the first branch only, and 1,236 in the second. 
Trained teachers.— The extent to which the training colleges have contributed to the 
existing supply of certificated teachers in Scotland is shown by the fact that, of 3,175 
masters employed in schools reported on last year, 1,868 (or 58.84 per cent.) had been  
-P-A-G-E-255
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, CCLV 
trained for two years, 321 (or 10.11 per cent.) for one year, and 101 (or 3.18 per cent.) for 
Jess than one year, while 885 (or 27.87 per cent.) were untrained. In like manner, of 2,369 
schoolmistresses, 1,650 (or 69.65 per cent.) had been trained for two years, 131 (or 5.53 
per cent.) for one year, and 568 (or 23.98 per cent.) were untrained. Of the teachers, 
however, who, from whatever cause, have not attended a training college, a considerable 
proportion cannot, except in a technical sense of the word, be classed as untrained, hay- 
ing, under the superintendence of some of our best teachers, satisfactorily completed the 
pupil teachers’ course and served as assistants in large schools before passing the exam- 
ination for a certificate and undertaking independent charges. 
Salaries.— The average salary of a certificated master, which in 1870 was 110/. 16s. 7d., 
is now 1371. 5s. 7d.; that of a schoolmistress was 551. 14s. 2d. in 1870, and is now 691. 
4s, 3d. These averages are calculated upon the whole body of certificated teachers, whether 
principal or assistant. In addition to their other emoluments, 1,798 out of 3,149 mas- 
ters and 472 out of 2,329 mistresses are provided with residences free of rent. 
Pensions.—During the year the department has received 26 applications on behalf of 
teachers in Scotland; since the practice of granting pensions was resumed in 1875, 106 
Scotch applications have been dealt with, and the department has granted 5 pensions of 
201., 19 of 25/., and 25 of 20/., and 15 gratuities, to the amount of 560/. 
Progress from 1872 to 1881, inclusive.— The increase of the population in Scotland from 
1872 to 1881, inclusive, according to estimates in the report of the education department, 
was 248,936, or an increase of 7.1 per cent. For the same period the school statistics 
show increase as follows: 
          
     
    Increase in number of inspected schools in general --- <9? OSS 
Tnerease in number of day departments --- 1, 262 
Increase in accommodation in day schools ~ 330, 795 
Increase in number of day scholars present at inspectors’ exa 249, 721 
Increase in average attendance - 196, 417 
Increase in number of certificated teachers - 2, 978 
Increase in number of pupil teachers_--_ - 709 
Increase in number studying in training colleges - 128 
  From 1872 to 1880 there was increase in the number of night departments and in the 
average attendance upon the same. In 1881 the number fell from 1,361 to 455, and the 
average attendance from 14,297 to 13, 082. 
The 1,902 schools inspected in 1872 were denominational; the number in 1881 belong- 
ing in this category is 369; the number of public schools, 2,467; of undenominational and 
other schools, 238. The accommodation in inspected schools has risen from 281,688 
places in 1872 to 612,483 in 1881, an increase in nine years of 117.45 per cent. 
The cost of maintenance per child in average attendance is higher in public than in 
voluntary schools, and higher in both classes of schools in Scotland than in England. 
c. IRELAND: Population, 5,174,836, Capital, Dublin; population, 249,602. 
From the report of the commissioners of national education in Ireland it appears that 
the number of primary schools on the operation list on the 31st of December, 1881, was 
7,648. During the year, 76 schools were dropped or ceased to exist as independent 
schools and 134 were brought into operation, giving a net increase of 58 schools as 
compared with 1880. The entire number of pupils on the rolls of these schools was 
1,066,259 and the average daily attendance was 453,567, a decrease of 14,990 below the 
average attendance in 1880. The attendance in 1880, it should be observed, was abnor- 
mally increased by the influx of children to receive rations of food distributed by relief 
committees. The attendance of 1881 shows an increase of 18,513 over that of the year 
1879. 
The total number of mixed schools under Roman Catholic teachers exclusively was 
2,776, attended by 368,887 Roman Catholic pupils and 22,838 Protestant pupils; the 
total number of mixed schools under Protestant teachers exclusively was 1,304, attended 
   
-P-A-G-E-256
    -CCLVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
by 25,370 Roman Catholic pupils and 127,065 Protestant pupils; the number of mixed 
schools under Roman Catholic and Protestant teachers conjointly was 85, attended by 
10,539 Roman Catholic pupils and 10,444 Protestant pupils. Of 3,385 schools showing 
an unmixed attendance, 2,821 were in charge of Roman Catholic teachers and 564 in 
charge of Protestants. 
Model schools.—The number of model schools reported is 29, containing 89 separate 
departments. 
Workhouse schools. — The number of workhouse schools in connection with the board én 
the 31st of December, 1881, was 158, having an enrolment of 15,420 and average daily 
attendance of 8,333. 
Examinations.— The total number of district schools examined for results during 1881 
was 7,601, including 69 evening schools. The number of pupils present at the examina- 
tions was 472,256, of whom 107,439 were infants. The number passed was 355,643. 
The percentages of passes gained at reading, writing, and arithmetic in Ireland, as 
compared with England and Wales and with Scotland, are set forth in the following 
table: 
  
Reading. Writing. | Arithmetic. 
     
      Ireland 76.2 
England and Wales 75.7 
Scotland.. $4.2 
     
Teachers.— The number of classed (i. e., certificated) teachers in the service of the 
commissioners December 31, 1881, was 10,621, viz, 7,437 principal teachers, 3,184 assist- 
ants. The number of pupil teachers or monitors was 6,450. The total number of 
teachers and students trained in 1881 at the training institution was 161. 
Pensions.—The number of teachers connected with the pension fund in the year 
ending December 31, 1881, was 9,343, and the amount paid in pensions was 6,7791. 18s. 
9d. and in gratuities 5,5401. 
Finances.— The statement of Soaniitars embodied in the report is for the year end- 
ing March 31, 1882. The total sum disbursed by the commissioners was 821,286/. 13s. 
7d. The parliamentary grant for 1881—’82 was 729, 8681. 
The Royal University of Ireland.—The Royal University of Ireland was chartered in 
1880, and by the same act of Parliament it was provided that the Queen’s University 
should be dissolved and its work transferred to the Royal University within two years of 
the date of the charter. The new university must be regarded as marking an era in the 
history of education in Ireland. It is empowered to confer all such degrees as can be 
conferred by any other university in the United Kingdom, degrees or other distinctions 
in theology excepted. No residence in any college nor attendance at lectures in the 
university is obligatory except for degrees in medicine and surgery. By these provisions 
the education of the Roman Catholic youth of Ireland is relieved of invidious distine- 
tions. 
The first matriculation examination was held December 6, 1881; the number of can- 
didates who presented themselves for examination was 614, of whom 508 passed; 28 
‘women weré included in the number. It should be observed that the privileges of the 
university are offered without distinction of sex. 
    “Special instruction in the United Kingdom generally — science and art.— The following in- 
formation is derived from the report of the science and art department, whose operations 
extend over the United Kingdom: 
During 1881 the number of persons attending science schools and classes in connection 
with the department was 61,177 as against 60,871 in 1880,. The number receiving in-
-P-A-G-E-257

struction in art was 917,101, an increase upon the previous year of 75,793... The number 
reported in art training includes 850,563 children who received instruction in drawing 
in elementary day schools. : 
At the Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines there were 46 regular and 
139 occasional students. At the Royal College of Science for Ireland there were 16 
regular and 20 occasional students. The total number of persons who, during the year, 
attended the different institutions and exhibitions in connection with the department 
was 4,811,258, an increase upon the previous year of 876,103. 
‘The expenditure of the department for the financial year 1881~’82, exclusive of the 
vote for the geological survey, which was 20,5711. 4s. 5d., amounted to 319,454/. 10s. 5d. 
Advanced scientific instruction.— One of the most important events in the history of the 
department for 1881 was the opening of the Normal School of Science and Royal School 
of Mines, which was formed by the union of two independent organizations maintained 
by government in the interests of science instruction. The Royal School of Mines dates 
as far back as 1851; the Normal School of Science arose out of the system of instruction 
and examination in elementary science established by the department in 1859. By the 
union of the two, general science instruction is fully organized and placed upon a sound 
basis, the special features of the school of minegare further developed, and the provision 
tor training science teachers is made more systematic and complete. Prof. T. H. Huxley, 
the dean of the new school, presents the following scheme of operations in his first report: 
Occasional students may enter for any course -of instruction, or for any number of 
courses, in such order as they please; but students who desire to become associates of 
the Normal-School of Science or of the Royal School of Mines must follow a prescribed 
order of study, which occupies from 3 to 3} years. 
In the first two years the students must all go through the same instruction in me- 
chanics and mathematics, physics, chemistry, elementary geology, astronomy, and min- 
’. eralogy, with drawing; afterwards they must elect to pass out in one or other of the eight 
divisions to the subjects of which the third and fourth years’ studies are entirely de- 
voted, namely, (1) mechanics, (2) physics, (3) chemistry, (4) biology, (5) geology, (6) agri- 
culture, (7) metallurgy, and (8) mining. 
A student who passes in all the subjects of the first two years and in the final sub- 
_ jects of division 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 becomes an associate of the Normal School of Science, 
while, if he takes the final subjects of division 7 or 8, he becomes an associate of the 
Royal School of Mines. 
The work of the school is arranged in such a manner as to permit the student to con- 
centrate his attention upon one subject at a time, and he is never occupied with the 
subjects of more than two divisions in the same term. By far the greater part of his 
‘timé is devoted to practical work in the laboratories, under the demonstrators and assist- 
ants. 
The examinations in the subjects of each year are held within that year, so that the 
final examinations are confined to the special subjects of the division in which the can- 
didate seeks for the associateship. 
City and Guilds of London Institute.—The City and Guilds of London Institute for the 
Advancement of Technical Education reports 1,563 candidates examined, 895 passed, 
and 3,300 candidates under instruction. The foundation stone of the society’s college, 
Finsbury, was laid May 10, and that of the central institution on the 18th of July. 
The expenses of the institute for the past year were estimated not to exceed 12,800/., 
and actually fell a little below that sum. 
Training of teachers.— In addition to the training colleges under government inspec- 
tion, various schools and associations in Great Britain make provision for the education 
of teachers. 
Cavendish College, Cambridge, founded by the County College Association, was opened 
in 1876. 
It is intended to enabie students somewhat younger than ordinary undergraduateés to 
pass through a university course and obtain a degree, and to train students who intend to 
become schoolmasters for that profession.

CCLVIIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. ‘ 
The University of Cambridge has established courses of lectures in Cambridge on the 
history, practice, and theory of education, and maintains also an annual examination in 
these subjects independent of the lectures. > 
University College, London, makes provision for training teachers of mathematics and 
chemistry; the course of training includes both theory and practice. The University of 
London has in contemplation a yearly examination in the art, theory, and history of edu- 
cation. 
The College of Preceptors is an incorporated society whose object is the improvement 
of secondary education, especially with reference to the middle classes. The president 
is Rev. T. W. Jex Blake, p. D., head master of Rugby. The society maintains two 
classes of examinations, viz, for pupils of schools and for teachers who are eandidates for 
the college diplomas. A training class for teachers is conducted under the auspices of 
men of established reputation, and plans are maturing for the extension of this branch ” 
of the society’s operations. The number of teachers who entered themselves for the 
examinations of the current year was 176. 
The Universities of Edinburgh and of St. Andrews have established chairs of the theory, 
practice, and history ef education. is : 
‘Grexce, constitutional monarchy: Area, 19,941 square miles; population, 1,679,775. Capital, 
Athens; population, 63,374. 
Communal schools were established by law in 1834 on the German system. The law 
requires the attendance at school of all children between the ages of 5 and 12 years. 
Each parish is to possess at least one school, supported by the district or parish, although 
many receive aid from ecclesiastical institutions. A local commission in each district 
exercises general supervision of the schools. The prefects and subprefects visit the 
schools of their districts and report to the minister. The teachers of the principal town 
of the prefecture and subprefecture inspect the schools of their district and report to the 
directors. of the normal school. These directors are charged with the general superin- 
tendence of all the schools of the country. Four classes of schools are reported in Greece: 
the communal, the ancient Greek, the gymnasium, and the university. In 1821, 95 
per cent. of the male population could neither read nor write; of women, 99 per cent. 
At present the percentage is males 55 per cent., females 75 per cent. In 1830 there were 
91 elementary schools, with 6,721 pupils, in Greece; at present, 1,215 boys’ schools, with 
‘74,880 pupils, and 75 schools for girls, with 16,932 pupils; also, two normal schools. The 
annual expenditure for primary education is 2,300,000 francs ($443,900); average salary 
of teachers, 512 francs ($100). ‘The Government bears one-third of the expenses. 
Tray, constitutional monarchy: Area, 114,296 square miles; population, 28,452,639. Capital, Rome; 
population (at the end of 1880), 300,467. : 
  On the 12th of November, 1881, the minister of public instruction, G. Baccelli, intro- 
duced a bill in the Chambers making school attendance obligatory for all boys and girls 
between the ages of 14 and 16 not attending a secondary institution of learning. The 
instruction is to be given in the evening,-so that it does not interfere with the daily work 
of the pupils. Z 
It is doubtful whether this law could be enforced in Italy as long as the primary schools 
proper are in a backward state. Obligatory laws have been passed before, but they were 
never enforced for want of schools and teachers. 
NETHERLANDS, constitutional monarchy: Area, 12,648 square miles ; population (December 31, 1881),

Dr. Willem Six. 
Elementary schools.—At the end of 1881 the number of elementary schools was 3,927, 
of which 2,791 were public, 86 private receiving subsidies, and 1,050 non-subsidized pri- 
vate schools. This shows an increase of 47 over the preceding year. The non-subsidized

_ private sehools were divided as follows as to religion: 564 Protestant, 443 Roman Cath- 
olic, 13 Jewish, and 30 unassigned. During the year 1881, 83 new public and 28 pri- 
vate schools were built, 92 public and 10 private were in course of construction, 93 publi¢ 
and 18 private were enlarged or repaired, 1,060 public and 141 private were reported 
as in need of repairs; plans were submitted for repairing or entirely rebuilding 359 pub- 
lic and 18 private schools, and 4 buildings were condemned. The school population, 
January 1, 1882, amounted to 289,623 boys (2,285 more than in 1881) and 262,309 girls 
(an increase of 5,032); 226,766 boys and 182,574 girls attended the public schools, or 469 
and 1,064, respectively, more than in 1880. The private schools receiving subsidies were 
attended by 1,638 boys and 2,399 girls, showing a decrease over the former year of 366 
and 586, respectively. The non-subsidized private schools were attended by 61,219 boys 
and 77,336 girls, an increase over 1880 of 2,182 and 4,554, respectively; 234,858 boys 
and 222,311 girls of 6 to12 years of age received instruction at school or at home; and, as 
the number of children of that age was 265,583 boys and 263,244 girls, 30,725 boys and 
40,933 girls were withoutinstruction. Gratuitous instruction was given in public schools 
to 126,099 boys and 103,815 girls, in private schools receiving subsidies to 110 boys and 
456 girls, and in private schools not receiving subsidies to 16,558 boys and 23,542 girls, 
making a total of 142,767 boys (119 less than inthe previous year) and 127,813 girls (1,810 
more than in the previous year) who received gratuitous instruction. 
Evening schools were attended by 22,212 boys and 12,029 girls who also attended the 
public day schools and by 8,610 boys and 2,256 girls who attended no other schools ; 
5,739 boys and 1,862 girls attended the review schools. The total tuition for primary pub- 
lic schools was 1,119,648 florins ($450,098). In the 3,927 schools there were 3,422 male 
and 461 female principal teachers, 5,035 male and 2,139 female teachers, and 2,919 male 
and 1,147 female assistants (pupil teachers), making a total of 15,123 teaching force. 
Since the school population was 551,932 there were on an average 36 pupils to a teacher, 
or, deducting the pupil teachers, about 50 scholars to a teacher. The expenditure for 
primary instruction was 11,555,506 florins ($4,695,313), and after deducting a revenue 
of 1,356,563 florins the balance of total outlay was 10,198,943 florins ($4,099,975). 
The expenditure for all kinds of education, except military, prison, and infant schools, 
was 14,168,735 florins, against 12,365,683 florins in 1880. The number of public infant 
schools was 111, with 8 male and 162 female teachers and 432 assistants, and with an 
attendance of 10,466 male and 10,076 female children, making a total of 20,542. The 
number of private schools of this class was 691, with 10 male and 951 female teachers 
and 1,144assistants. There were 31,531 male and 35,655 female children in these schools; 
67,186 in all. 
Normal schools.—In the seven state normal schools, viz, at Bois-le-Duc (’s Hertogen- 
bosch), Nymwegen, Haarlem, Middleburg, Deventer, Groningen, and Maestricht there 
were 606 pupils in the school year 1880—’81. The expenditure for these schools in 1880 - 
was 493,872 florins and 473,943.25 florins in 1881. Besides these normal schools the nor- 
mal courses in the provinces, which wereattended by 2,360 male and 733 female students 
in 1880, had an attendance of 2,333 males and 955 females in 1881. On the13thof May 
of that year the organization of these courses, which had up to that time been temporary 
and experimental, was effected by a decree of the minister of the interior. The regulations 
prescribe a four years’ course and a preparatory course for pupils 12 to 14 years old. 
The age of admission to the normal course proper is 14 years. The programme includes 
the Dutch language, reading and writing, history, geography, arithmetic, geometry, 
natural history, singing, pedagogy, drawing, mathematics, gymnastics, French, and fe- 
male handiwork. Besides these normal courses there were seminaries for a similar pur- 
pose at Leyden and Amsterdam, organized in accordance with a ministerial decree of 
October 25, 1881, which were attended by 116 male and 140 female students, and 23 
schools where teachers are prepared for private schools. - These schools had 698 male and 
100 female students. The outlay for this kind of instruction in 1881 was 1,077,080 flor- 
ins, including that for the State normal schools above given.

Secondary instruction.—The number of Gymnasien and Progymnasien remained un- 
changed. There were 24 of the former and 5 of the latter. There were 316 teachers at 
the beginning of 1881 and 1,730 students. At the close of the year these numbers had 
increased to 334 and 1,911. The outlay by the communes, or districts, for Gymnasiem 
and Progymnasien in 1881 was 664,628.75 florins ($257,181). 
The four burgher day schools had 178 students. The burgher evening schools num- 
bered 31 and were attended by 2,553 scholars. Four other schools of the same grade 
where special attention is paid to industrial studies had an attendance of 1,140. As to 
parentage, the parents of 70 of the 178 scholars of the four burgher day schools were me- 
chanics and handicraftsmen, 40 were shopkeepers, 12 architects, and 44 officials, teach- 
ers, and military officers. Of the 2,553 pupils of the burgher evening schools and the 
1,140 students of the four similar schools mentioned above, 2,855 already had a trade or 
occupation at which they were busy during the day. There were 369 teachers in these 
various schools. 
The number of drawing or industrial schools was °46, with 252 teachers and 4,842 
pupils. There were 59 higher burgher schools, with a total of 687 teachers and 4,653 
pupils. Of these schools 20 were government institutions, 11 of which had five years’ and 
9 three years’ courses; 35 were communal schools, 23 of which had five years’, 2 four years’, 
and 10 three years’ courses; 1 communal industrial school with a three years’ course; 1 
private school receiving a subsidy, with a six years’ course, and 2 private schools not re- 
ceiving subsidies, 1 of five and the other of three years’ course; 28 of the 35 communal 
schools received subsidies from the Government; 21 of these received female pupils, and 
the total number of the latter was 150. Of the 687 teachers 19 were employed in more 
than one school. f 
Secondary schools for girls received an increase of two in 1881, making a total of 14, 
with 1,089 pupils. There were 107 female and 60 male teachers. 
Superior education.—In the year 1880-81, there were 514 students enrolled at the 
University of Leyden, 385 at Utrecht, and 251 at Groningen, 1,150 in all. These figures 
show the number of students enrolled or registered with the rector, not the number 
inscribed in the almanac or album studiosorum. There were at the same time 315 
civilian students, 194 hearers, and 128 military students at the commercial university at 
Amsterdam. In 1881 the Government expended for the three universities 1,258,245 
florins ($505,815), and for other institutions of higher education 263,580.56 florins (includ- 
ing 183,948 florins for gymnasial inspection and subsidies), making a total of 1,521,828 
florins ($611,775). 
Special instruction.— The government agricultural school at Wageningen had 63 schol- 
ars in the higher burgher school department and 66 in the agricultural departments, 
making 129 in all. At the experiment station connected with this school 802 researches. 
-were made during the year. There were 24 students at the horticultural school at Wa- 
tergraafsmeer. 
The polytechnic school at Delft had 343 pupils; 49 students obtained opportunities 
during the vacations to practise various kinds of engineering on public and other works, 
bridge building, levelling, surveying, &c. 
The number of naval schools, teachers, and pupils remained the same as in the previous 
year. 
The Deaf and Dumb Institute at Groningen had 201 students, that at Rotterdam 144, 
that at Gestel 148 (81 males and 67 females), and the Institution for the Blind at Amster- 
dam had 68 students, of whom 38 were males and 30 females. 
The East India institution at Delft had 129 students for the year 1881. This es- 
tablishment is designed to give instruction in the languages, ethnography, and econom- 
ics of the Dutch East Indies. There were 71 candidates at the examination for East 
India officers, 50 of whom passed the examination. The similar institution at Leyden 
had 12 students for the year 1881. There were 4 candidates for examination, 3 of whom 
passed. The total outlay for secondary instruction, including industrial schools and in-

stitutes for the deaf and dumb, by the government and communes in 1881 was 1,965,118 
florins ($789,978). 
The twenty-first course of the state school of midwifery opened October 1, 1881, with 
20 students. The government expended 11,683 florins for the support of this school in 
1881. . 
There were 63 students at the state veterinary school in 1881, of whom 3 were educated 
for the home military veterinary service, 5 for the civil, and 1 for the military veterinary 
service in the East Indies. The state expended 74,598 florins in 1881 for this institution. 
There were 39 officials and 315 students at the Royal Military Academy at the begin- 
ning of the school year 1881-82. Eighteen of the officials were civilians. The gradu- 
ates of this school are assigned to the various branches of the military service at home 
or in the Dutch East Indies. The programme includes surveying, natural sciences, 
languages, ethnography, &c., of the Dutch East Indies, military science, mathematics 
(calculus), and mechanics. In the second division of the military school the course 
opened October 1, 1881, with 22 officers, 15 of whom were from the Dutch East Indian 
army. ‘There were during the year 454 volunteers in the instruction battalion and in 
the artillery instruction company 180 volunteers. The school programme included read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic (whole numbers and fractions), the metric system, the Dutch 
language, geography of Europe, history of the Netherlands, military accounts and re- 
ports. There were 135 appointees at the Royal Marine Institute at Willemsoord at the 
- beginning of the school year 1881-’82, 486 boys on the two school ships at Amsterdam 
and Rotterdam in 1881, 17 pilot apprentices on the guard ship at Amsterdam the same 
year, 95 boatswain apprentices on the practice ship, and 239 students at the normal 
navigation school. For the military medical service at home and abroad 157 students 
entered the course September 1, 1881, besides 17 students of pharmacy. 
Norway, constitutional monarchy: Area, 122,869 square miles; population in 1879, 1,916,000. 
The latest statistics from Norway were received in 1875, when the school population 
was 302,000; number of schools, 4,736; pupils, 261,622; teachers, 4,030. Education has 
been obligatory in Norway for a series of years, parents being required to send their 
children from the age of 7 in town and 8 in the country up to 14 to some public 
school. Each parish has its schoolmaster or masters, who live either in fixed residences 
or move from place to place, teaching so-called ambulatory schools and being paid by a 
tax levied in the parish in addition to state grants. The schools are graded as primary 
and secondary. In the lower grades reading, writing, arithmetic, religion, and singing 
are taught. Almost every town supports a superior school; a college is found in 17 of 
the principal towns. ‘These colleges are maintained in part by subsidies from the goy- 
ernment. The university at Christiania, founded in 1811 by the Danish government, is 
attended by about 900 students annually. Norway has also 4 schools for deaf-mutes, 1 
for the blind, and 2 for idiots. 
PoRTUGAL, constitutional monarchy: Area, 36,510 square miles; population, 4,745,124. Capital, 
Lisbon; population, 233,389. 
A compulsory education law was enacted, in 1844, but its provisions are so rarely en- 
forced that only a small fraction of the children of the middle and lower classes attend 
school. Although some progress in primary education is reported within the last few 
years no statistics later than those of 1876 have been received. At that date 4,510 
schools and 198,131 pupils were reported. Secondary instruction is given in the lyceums} 
the clergy obtain gratuitous instruction in 6 seminaries and 8 training schools; and the 
university at Coimbra gives instruction in law, theology, medicine, mathematics, and 
philosophy. The number of students atthe university in 1881*was 564. Since 1845-’46 
the regular students have numbered. 29,906. Subdivided as to departments there were 
in theology 2,527; law, 14,812; political science, 381; médicine, 2,056; mathematics, 
2,885; philosophy, 5,739; design, 1,506. The Polytechnic Academy at Oporto, which

was in its fifth year in 1881, reported 153 students in the special courses of civil and 
mining engineering, architecture and design, the business and agricultural courses, and 
in the preparatory courses for medicine and pharmacy and for the naval school. 
Russta, absolute monarchy: Area, 8,444,766 square miles; population, 85,685,945. Capital, St. 
Petersburg; population, 667,926. 
The mass of the population of Russia is as yet without education; in fact, elementary 
education is almost impossible according to the present system of instruction. The 
greatest dearth of schools isin those provinces which have a purely Russian population, 
while the Tartar provinces and those occupied by German colonists are better off. The 
Pskow district has’ 151 schools, while the number of children of school age calls for 
2,600. Charkoty has 423 schools and sheuld have 5,000. In Kostroma the proportion 
is 263 existing schools to 3,000 required; in Novgorod the ratio is 180 to 2,600; in Samara, 
492 to 1,680; and in Wjatka, 535 to 3,900. Ina male population of 40,000,000 there 
is 1 pupil to 45 persons, while the ratio among the women is 1 to 222. The peasant 
children can only obtain elementary instruction in schools which have been established 
in strict conformity to all the legal requirements, which are supported from certain 
specified funds, and whose teachers have received their appointments in accordance with 
certain specified forms. There are few such schools. The higher institutions are under 
fewer restrictions. Statistics of 2 Russian universities —those of Moscow and Kief—are 
athand for 1881. The faculty at Moscow consisted of 103 members: 1 professor of theology 
(Greek orthodox), 40 ordinary and 12 ‘‘extraordinary”’ professors, 22 Docenten, 4 lect- 
urers, 1 astronomer, 2 prosectors and 3 assistant prosectors, 8 professors not attached to 
any special branch, and 11 Privatdocenten. Three chairs are vacant. The pupils num- 
bered 2,413 in January, 1881, and 2,430 a year later. In the medical course were 1,397 
“hearers;”’ in law, 451 students; in mathematics and physical sciences, 392; and in his- 
tory and philology, 190. At the close of 1881 there were 337 graduates, and 329 students 
left without finishing the course. The University St. Wladimir, at Kief, had 36 ordinary 
professors, 8 ‘‘extraordinary,’’ 13 Docenten, 3 lecturers, 1 astronomer, and 11 Privatdo- 
eenten. Thirteen chairs were vacant. In 1881 there were 1,041 students.

The latest official statements about primary instruction in Spain bear upon the decade 
1871-1880. The number of public primary schools on October 30, 1880, was 23,132; 
private primary grades, 6,796; in all, 29,928. The pupils in these schools numbered 
1,443,222 (849,312 boys and 593,910 girls) for the public ones and 326,380 (boys, 150,257; 
girls, 176,123) for the privateschools. Thetotalsareas follows: 1,769,602, of whom 999,569 
were boys and 770,033 girls. The school-houses constructed between 1871 and 1880 
were 429 in number; those bought, 272; repaired, 1,470; total, 2,171. In the normal 
schools, 24,888 boys and 12,447 girls—total, 37,335—received instruction during that 
period. The budget for primary instruction in the municipalities in 1879~80 was 
20,810,760 franes ($4,016,477); in the provinces, 1,776,911 francs ($342,944) for 1880.. In 
1850 there were 600,000 children of both sexes attending the primary schools. In 1865 
more than 1,300,000 were reported. The increase during the 15 years was about 117 per 
cent. Between 1865 and 1880 there was still an increase, but not in the former propor- 
tion. As stated above, there were 1,769,602 pupils in 1880, which, compared with 1865, 
gives an increase for the last 15 years of about 36 per cent. An official report for 1879-’80 
has the following concerning superior instruction: The University of Madrid (the so 
called Central University, as it is the only one authorized to confer doctor degrees) has 
five faculties, viz: philosophy and letters, with 275 students; law, with 2,363 students; 
natural and physical sciences, with 376 students; medicine, with 2,468; and pharmacy, 
with 1,366; total, 6,848 students. Madrid has also a school of civil engineering, with 
190 students; a school of science, with 343 students; a school of fine arts, with 773 stu-

dents; a school of arts and trades, with 4,770; a high school of commerce, 46 students; 
a high school of agriculture, 151; school of veterinary surgery, 796; a national school of 
music, with 1,877 students, and a school of political sciences, with 222 students. The 
other Spanish universities are Barcelona, with 2,459 students; Granada, with 1,225; 
Oviedo, with 216; Salamanca, with 372; Santiago, 770; Seville, 1,382; Valencia, with 
2,118 students; Valladolid, 880; and Saragossa, with 771 students. 
SWEDEN, constitutional monarchy: Area, 170,979 square miles; population, 4,578,901. Capital, 
Stockholm; population, 173,433. 
According to the law of June 18, 1842, each parish of Sweden is to have at least one 
well established school with an instructor who is a, graduate of a primary normal. Still, 
two communes, or parishes, where the schools are few and far between, may unite and 
carry on one school only. Ambulatory schools are also found in sections of the country 
where there are comparatively few people, and where the schools are necessarily widely 
separated. The foundation of infant schools dates from 1853; the superior primary 
schools were organized in 1858. Tach school district has a school board, which regulates: 
the methods of teaching, discipline, school age, &c. Ordinarily the child enters school 
at 7 years of age and finishes the course at 14. Children receiving instruction at home: 
are subject to a weekly examination before the school board. In certain provinces there 
are special schools for young people who are over 14. The aim of these schools is to de- 
velop the knowledge obtained in the lower grades. The course of study in the primary 
schools covers reading, writing, mental arithmetic, memorizing, singing, &e. The public 
schools have two divisions, one for children from 8 to 10 years of age, answering to the 
lower grades of the elementary schools, and another for those older. Statistics for the: 
whole of Sweden are not at hand, but for the middle schools, or ‘‘hégre liroverk,’’ the 
following figures for the autumn of 1881 are given: In 34 schools—4 of them at Stock- 
holm— 11,431 pupils were reported. These were divided into 5,076 in the Gymnasien, 
1,879 in the Realschulen, and 4,476 in the common grades, or burgher schools, as the 4 
lower classes are called. The hégre liiroverk are seven-class schools and the two upper 
classes have Greek and ‘‘no-Greek”’ divisions —1,408 pupils in the former, 1,652 in the 
latter. There are also 24 five-class schools, with 2,893 pupils, the two upper classes con- 
taining 395 Latin pupils (preparing for the Gymnasium) and 575 Realschule pupils; 19 
three-class schools, with 801 pupils; 9 two-class, with 227 pupils; and 9 one-class, ‘‘peda- 
gogier,’’ with 159 pupils; in all, 95 schools, with 15,511 pupils. The two universities 
at Upsala and Lund are well endowed and take a high rank. They are attended by 
about 1,500 (Upsala) and 650 (Lund) students annually. Sweden has 17 schools for 
deaf-mutes, 4 for the blind, and 4 for idiots. 
Swirzmruann, federal republic: Area, 15,992 square miles; population, 2,846,102. Capital, Berne; 
population, 36,000. 
The school statistics for the year 1881, just published by the Swiss government, have- 
not been received to date, so that only stray items can be given. Each of the cantons- 
and demi-cantons has its local government, and in all the cantons, but especially those 
of Northeastern Switzerland, education is widely diffused. In the Protestant cantons 
the proportion of school attending children is to the whole population as 1 to 5; in the 
half Protestant and half Roman Catholic cantons it is as 1 to 7; in the Roman Catholic, 
1to9. Instruction is obligatory between the ages of 6 and 12. Primary and secondary- 
schools are found in every district; in the former, the elements of education, with geog- 
raphy and history, are taught; in the latter (for children from 12 to 15 years of age), 
modern languages, geometry, natural history, the fine arts,and music. There are normal’ 
schools in all the cantons and there are 4 universities. d 
In the Canton of Ziirich the school fund amounted to 57,000 francs in 1832; in 1877 it 
reached 1,740,000 francs; in 1881 the districts alone raised 2,056,378 francs for the ele--

mentary and 340,096 francs for the secondary schools. The cantonal fund for these two 
grades was 1,000,000 francs, so that the schools receive about three and a half millions 
annually. In 1880-81 Ziirich (canton) had 93 ‘‘review”’ schools (Fortbildungsschulen) 
receiving state aid. The teachers numbered 206; pupils, 177 under 15 years of age and 
1,937 over that age. There were also 54 schools taught the whole year. Gewerbeschulen 
were reported at Riesbach and Ziirich. In the former were 88 pupils over 15 years old 
and 9 teachers; in the latter, 467 pupils of like age and 22 teachers. Other schools of 
this canton were the industrial art school of Ziirich, 2 schools for modelling, an evening 
school for girls, a girls’ work school, and a cantonal technical school. The university 
at Ziirich (or German-Swiss high school, as it is called) had 351 students in the winter 
semester of 1881-’82. They were subdivided into 18 theological students, 34 for law, 180 
studying medicine, and 119 philosophy. 
In the Canton of Berne there are primary, secondary, review, handiwork, watchmaking, 
and other industrial schools. The handiwork and technical industrial schools embrace 
instruction in drawing, modelling, practical reckoning, elements of geometry (especially 
surface and body measurements), book-keeping in German and French, physics and 
* chemistry, and technological branches. Eleven such schools reported in 1880, with 450 
pupils. The handiwork school of Berne had 181 pupils in 1878-79. The drawing school 
of Brienz, at the end of 1880-81, had 38 pupils; that of St. Immer, 43 pupils. The art 
school of Berne has 4 teachers and from 15 to 20 pupils who are studying oil painting, 
drawing (academic and ornamental), modelling, painting in water colors, perspective and 
technical drawing, and methods of instruction in drawing. The city of Berne has 2 
secondary schools for boys, with 5 classes each; the boys enter these schools after passing 
through 4 primary school classes. The girls’ schools have two divisions: a secondary 
school for pupils from 10 to 15 years of age and an upper division for those from 15 to 19 
years. Here, too, in the one school for girls, is a flve years’ course, as in the boys’ schools. 
The studies included in the schools for girls are religion, pedagogy, German, French, 
English, mathematics, history, geography, natural history, singing, drawing, writing, 
fancy or handiwork, gymnastics, letter writing, a business course with book-keeping, 
knowledge of different kind of wares, and domestic economy. Berne University en- 
rolled 385 students, viz: in the theological courses, 35; in the legal, 139; in the med- 
ical, 150; and in the philosophical, 61. 
Lausanne, Canton of Vaud, gives information for 1880-’81 of 98 schools for boys, 99 for 
girls, and 624 mixed schools; pupils, 33,876, from 7 to 16 years of age; teachers, 509 
men and 312 women. The normal school had 154 students in 4 classes; the industrial 
school, 414 pupils in 8 classes; the cantonal college, 229 pupils in December, 1881; the 
Gymnasium, 91; and the academy, 264. The 17 communal colleges had 353 pupils in the 
classical divisions and 982 in the scientific divisions. Twelve villages report superior 
schools (higher schools for girls), with 705 pupils. At these district schools were 170 
teachers. Many private institutions are also reported, with from 150 to 200 pupils. The 
deaf and dumb institute at Moudon had 29 in its courses; an agricultural course (at Lau- 
sanne), 24 students. 
Aargau reports 34 review schools, 4 of them for industries. The most important is at 
‘Lenzburg; its courses are continued the whole year. 
St. Gall’s school districts brought 2,385,898 francs to the public schools in 1879-’80; in 
1880-’81 the sum was increased to 2,527,445. The cantonal fund for education was a 
million francs. 
Lucerne reported 24 district schools in 1879-’80, with 551 pupils in the winter course. 
The summer course of 1880 was held in 23 district schools; pupils, 417. In 1880-’81 
there were 24 secondary schools, with a total of 502 pupils. An additional 226 pupils 
were noted in Lucerne City, Miinster, Sursee, and Willisau. Pupils of the canton tak- 
ing the winter and full year’s course were 1,029 in 1879-’80 and 728 in 1880-81. 
Graubiinden (Grisons) had 358 pupils in the cantonal schools in 1880-81 to 361 in the

preceding year. At the Gymnasium were 67 pupils; in the Realschule, 168; teachers’ 
seminary, 123; total, 358. These figures are for the beginning of the year. 
Basle reported 44 ‘‘review’’ schools in 1879 and 34 in the winter of 1880-’81. The 
pupils numbered 647 at the beginning of the course and 472 at the termination. Read- 
ing, composition, arithmetic, and a knowledge of the history of Switzerland were among 
the branches taught. The drawing and modelling school of the city of Basle, which 
was founded in 1796, was to undergo certain changes in the plan of organization. In 
1879-80 800 students were reported; the average was 740. The school for woman’s work 
had 139 pupils in the latter part of 1880. Branches taught were sewing by hand and 
machine, dressmaking (pressing, cutting, trimming), arithmetic, and book-keeping. 
Basle University had 267 students in 1881-’82 (winter semester): in the theological 
course, 56; legal, 41; medical, 100; philosophical, ‘70. 
Geneva’s review (Fortbildung) school numbered 104 students in 1879-’80; the commer- 
cial and industrial school, 146 regular students and 206 externs; the school for watch- 
makers, 90 pupils in 1880-’81, at the end of the year 58, 28 having finished their appren- 
ticeship, and 4 leaving before the close of the course. Both theoretical instruction and 
practical instruction are given in this school. The studies cover French, arithmetic, 
mathematics, linear drawing, physics, and book-keeping. The drawing and art schools 
of Geneva City were divided as follows in 1880-81: 2 preparatory schools, with 63 pupils; 
1 school for young ladies, with 164 pupils; 1 middle school for modelling and ceramics 
(with 29 pupils) and for drawing from the figure (34 pupils); 1 school for ornamentation 
and architecture, 54 pupils; 1 school for art industry, 72; 1 school for designing from 
nature (lasting from November to April), with 27 pupils; 1 school of fine arts, with 18 
pupils. The canton has also a faculty of medicine, a school of chemistry, a school of 
pharmacy, and now a school of dentistry. With 100,000 inhabitants, the expenditure 
for educational purposes is quite remarkable. In 1865 it amounted to 343,909 francs, 
that is, 11 per cent. of the total expenditures for cantonal affairs. In 1880 the amount 
was 1,135,535 frances, or 23 per cent. of the expenditure from the treasury, viz, 4,907,924 
francs. 
From Solothurn the statistics are: 2,034 Fortbildung (or review) pupils, under charge of 
212 teachers in 1880-’81. ; 
Thurgovia had in the winter of 1880-’81, in similar schools, 2,464 pupils and 240 
teachers. e 
Glarus reported an additional number of such review schools. The numberin 1880-’81 
was 22, with 550 pupils. Of these, 320 were over 16 years of age. 
Schwyz, in 1881, reported a drawing school, with 40 pupils; a ‘‘review’’ school, with 
24 pupils, at Ibach; another at Einsiedeln, pupils not given, but with instruction in ele- 
mentary branches, book-keeping, drawing, and French. 
Uri had 1,330 male and 1,354 female pupils in the primary and secondary grades. 
‘The teachers were : men, 25; women, 25. Two districts kept all-day schools throughout 
the entire year; 2 districts, half-day schools for the whole year. Three districts had all- 
day schools for half of the year and 16 had half-day schools for the half year. 
TurKEY (in Europe): Area, 62,028 square miles; population, 4,275,000. 
No reports are at hand from this section of the world, but from a statement made by 
the inspector of the burgher schools at Constantinople it is learned that 450 burgher 
schools are found in Constantinople and the provinces at present. More than 5,000 
pupils attend these schools. About 160 graduates were noted, to 60 in the preceding 
year. 
Bulgaria.—In 1878~’79 there were 1,088 primary schools in Bulgaria, and in 1881 the 
number had increaséd to 1,365. The primary schools are supported by the communes 
and also by the churches, the latter contributing two-thirds of the products of the sale of 
candies for the purpose (the manufacture of candles for religious purposes being a monop-  
-P-A-G-E-266

oly of the clergy). ‘The communes contribute a portion of their domain for school pur- 
poses. Before the Russian occupation the school-houses were wretched structures. More 
than four hundred have been built since then. It was found easier to build these unpre- 
tending edifices than to find teachers. Under the Turkish rule intelligent Bulgarians 
who wished to remain in their country were obliged to become teachers, priests, or physi- 
cians. Since the advent of Russian rule the same class of people have found employment 
in administrative affairs, and those who have remained with the schools have had the task 
of hastily preparing young persons who were willing to serve as teachers. After six 
weeks or two months of pedagogical training these young teachers enter upon their profes- 
sion. Two-thirds of the Bulgarian schoolmasters are from seventeen to twenty-four 
years of age. In 1881 two normal schools were established. 
Besides the purely Bulgarian schools, the government has had to preserve the Mus- 
sulman and the Israelite schools. There are about 300,000 Turks remaining in the 
principality, and the instruction in their schools is entirely religious. The Jews are the 
descendants of those who were expelled from Spain by Philip II and speak Spanish to 
this day. Their schools are of a primitive character, but have been much improved 
recently through the efforts of the Hebrew alliance. Twelve cities have secondary 
schools, and at Sophia there is one where the ancient languages are taught. As yet (1881) 
there is no superior education. An agricultural school will soon be opened. Students 
of special branches (law, medicine, industrial arts) pursue their studies abroad, the ma- 
jority of them at government expense. 
Roumelia.—In Eastern Roumelia, with a population of over a million, there were, in the 
school year 1880-’81, 1,412 primary schools, with 80,591 pupils, of whom 23,789 were 
girls. The Bulgarians, who form the greater part of the population, had 841 schools, with 
48,000 scholars; the Turks, 471 schools, with 15,189 scholars; and the rest were scattered 
among Greeks, Armenians, and Jews, who made up the rest of the population. Educa- 
tion is obligatory in Roumelia from the seventh to the thirteenth year, and the statute 
further declares that after fifteen years from the date of its publication only those indi- 
viduals shall have the right to vote who shall be able to read and write Bulgarian, 
Greek, or Turkish. According to the most probable calculations, two-thirds of the chil- 
dren of the province were subject to the compulsory law. The majority of the teach- 
ers were Bulgarians. Among the Turks the imans and muezzins perform the functions 
of teachers. There are no normal schools, but young teachers study pedagogics during the 
vacations. Inspection is performed not by special officers but by physicians, ecclesiastics, 
and other prominent individuals. There are four secondary schools, which have been 
established since the Russian occupation, two for boys and two for girls. There is no — 
superior education. Some young students are educated abroad at the expense of the 
government, as in Bulgaria. 
II.— Asta, 
BritisH Inp1A: Area, 1,425,723 square miles; population, 254,899,516. 
  In 1870 the government of India made over to the local governments several depart- 
ments of the administration, including education, with a fixed imperial assignment for 
their support. - 
In respect to education, it was especially stipulated that the existing code, the grant 
in aid rules, and other matters of general principle should not be affected by the transfer. 
The systems of education maintained in the several provinces under this arrangement 
bear a general resemblance to that of Great Britain. The expenditures are met by © 
grants in aid, local taxes, tuition fees, subscriptions, endowments, &c. With respect to 
grade, the institutions are classified into universities, colleges, secondary schools (includ- 
ing high and middle schools), primary schools, and schools for special or technical train- 
ing. With respect to their relation to government, the institutions shown in the official 
reports are classified into government schools, aided private schools, and unaided private 
schools under government inspection. This simple outline comprises a system of com-~

plicated detail, of which the most prominent features are separate schools for boys and 
girls, the division of the schools into English, vernacular, and English and vernacular, and 
the classification of scholars by race or creed. 
Universities. —Superior education is provided in the universities of Calcutta, Madras, _ 
and Bombay. A fourth university will doubtless soon be added, a bill for conferring. 
upon the Punjab University College the powers of a university having been transmitted 
to the secretary of state, who had previously intimated his approval of the measure. 
London University has furnished the model for those of India. Their function is to 
confer degrees upon matriculates who study in the affiliated colleges and schools and 
upon such other candidates as may be presented under the rules of the senates. 
Degrees in science have recently been instituted in the Bombay University and the 
name of the first arts examination changed to the previous examination, to indicate 
the place it now holds as introductory to both degrees in the faculty of arts, viz, B. A. 
and B. sc. 
During the present year the Bethune School for Girls has been added to the number of 
government colleges affiliated to the Calcutta University. Its courses lead to the first 
examination in arts. 
The record of university examinations and passes for the year gives some idea of the 
extent to which the people avail themselves of the provision for superior education.

The year was signalized by the success for the first time in India of two young native 
ladies at the first arts examination at Calcutta University and two at Madras Univer- 
sity. The latter bestows the degrees in arts upon candidates who have not qualified in 
a classical language. From the classification of the examinees with respect to race an@ 
creed, it appears that the Brahmins take the lead in higher education.

  CCLXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The expenditure upon the three universities for the year under report was 143,555 
rupees (a rupee= 39 cents). 
The following summaries are derived from the official reports on public instruction in 
nine provinces (Bombay, Bengal, Madras, Punjab, northwestern provinces and Oudh, 
Assam, central provinces, Coorg, and British Burmah) and two native states (Hyderabad. 
and Mysore): Population, 201,064,016; number of scholars in arts colleges March 31, 
5,620; number in colleges for professional training, 1,497; number in schools for special 
or technical training, 19,847; number in secondary schools (high and middle), boys, 
260,854; girls, 14,486. 
Secondary instruction.—Secondary education is most widely diffused in Bombay and 
Bengal. In the former it is estimated that the ratio of boys in high schools to the whole 
population is 1 to 5,000, in middle schools 1 to 1,666; in the latter the estimates are: 
tor high schools, 1 to 1,400; for middle schools 1 to 1,000. 
Elementary instruction.— The reports of primary instruetion include all the aided schools 
and unaided schools under government inspection. These had, March 31, a total enrol- 
ment of 1,888,345, viz, 1,784,988 boys and 103,357 girls. 
The total annual expenditure for primary education was 6,685,070 rupees, of which 
6,178,713 were for boys’ schools and 506,357 for girls’ schools. The total government 
expenditure for primary education was 2,238,797 rupees, of which 2,016,771 were for 
boys’ schools and 222,026 for girls’ schools. The expenditure for primary education is 
not a very high percentage of the total expenditure for education. In Bombay, where it 
is highest, the expenditure for primary schools for boys was 38.28 per cent. of the total 
expenditure and for girls 4.02 per cent. . 
The proportion of government expenditure to the total expenditure varies greatly in 
the several provinces. This is partly due to the operation of the payment upon results 
system and partly to the constant endeavor to reduce the government appropriations 
and to secure adequate support for the schools from district and municipal funds. 
In the three provinces reporting the largest expenditure, the ratios of government 
expenditure to the total for primary education are as follows : Bombay, for boys’ schools 
21 per cent.; for girls’, 17 per cent; Bengal, for boys’ schools, 19 per cent; for girls’, 40 
per cent.; Madras, for boys’ schools, 9 per cent.; for girls’, 24 per cent. 
The policy of the government is to reduce appropriations; at the same time a strong 
opposing party maintain that the increase of local taxation is impossible. The director 
of public instruction for Bombay, in his report for 1880-’81, observes that the local re- 
‘sources are now almost entirely appropriated and that a further extension of primary 
education depends mainly on the ability of government to make a larger grant in aid of 
local fund schools. Similar statements are made by other directors. The question of 
school revenue promises to become the most important of any affecting the progress of 
education in India. 
The current reports call attention to the growing interest in education in the rural 
districts and among the Mahometan population, to the tendency to multiply schools for 
girls, and to the steady increase in the number of indigenous schools brought under 
government inspection. With all that has been accomplished, however, it is estimated 
that upwards of 25,000,000 children needing primary education are uncared for, and 
such is the urgent necessity of extending the means of elementary education among the 
masses of India that an educational commission is to be organized to devise practical 
measures for meeting the demand. 
The total number of scholars reported in inspected schools of all classes in the nine 
provinces and two native states under consideration was 2,190,197, of whom 206,832, or 
a little above 9 per cent., were studying English. 
Japan, absolute monarchy: Area, 156,604 square miles; population, 34,338,479. Capital, Tokio; 
population, 811,510. 
The latest educational statistics for Japan are to be found in the Report of the Com- 
missioner of Education for 1879. The Japanese code of education. revised to Decem-

ber 28, 1880, was fully stated in the report for 1880. A late item of information is 
that the Japanese minister of education has gone to Berlin for the purpose of studying 
German methods of education. Certain changes, as a result of this visit, are to be in- 
troduced in the home system. According to a statement made by him, there were 
53,000 government schools in Japan in 1872, arranged according to European models; 
this gives one primary school to every 640 inhabitants. In 1875 the number of pupils 
was about half a million, and in 1877 there were 1,500,600 male and 500,000 female 
pupils. Some 57,000 men and 1,275 women were teaching at that date. As the num- 
ber of. persons of school age is, however, over five millions, many new schools are 
necessary. Private persons have contributed over thirty million dollars for school pur- 
poses, besides large gifts of lands, and the number of pupils in 1881 exceeded three 
millions.

Each of the seven provinces forming the Dominion of Canada has power to regulate 
its own local affairs, including education, so far as may be done without interfering with 
the policy and action of the central administration under the governor general. 
Public instruction is most of the provinces is under the control of a council of educa- 
tion and of one or more superintendents, according as the religious element is or is not 
recognized. Full information upon this point is embodied in my annual report for 1876.

tendent of education, C. C. McKenzie, 
The report of the superintendent for 1881, being the eleventh annual TPE includes 
a brief survey of the decade. 
Total enrolment in common schools for the current year, 2,579; average daily attend- 
ance, 1,313.61; enrolment in high school, 74; average daily attendance, 45.07; total 
enrolment for all public schools, 2,653; total nate of teachers, 68; permanent staff, 62; 
total annual expenditure for education, $58,515, of which sum $9,254 were for buildings 
and insurance. From the review of the decade it appears that during the period the 
sum of $480,395 has been expended for education and that more than 6,000 children 
have been instructed. 
b, New Brunswick: Area, 27,174 square miles; population, 321,233. Capital, Fredericton. Chief 
superintendent of education, Theodore H. Rand. 
The mode of support of schools in New Brunswick is threefold : (1) District assess- 
thent, (2) county assessment, and (3) government grants. The government grants for 
the year, as shown by the tables, amounted to $155,020; the county assessment, to 
$83,927; the district assessment is not given in the report, but is estimated by the 
superintendent at $250,000.1 To these sums should be added annual government grant 
to university, $8,844, and government grant for education of the blind and of deaf-mutes, 
$1,220, making a total of $499,012. 
The following statement of average rate of salaries is also furnished by the superintend-

The system of public instruction in Ontario is so highly approved that a detailed ac- 
count of its organization will doubtless be of interest to those who may be intrusted 
with the development of a system elsewhere. For the following statement I am in- 
debted to Philip Carroll, esq., United States commercial agent at Port Stanley and St. 
Thomas, Canada: 
Outline of the system of public instruction in Ontario.—The law provides for a depart- 
ment of education which shall be presided over by the minister of education. The 
powers and duties of the department of education are: (1) To prepare from time to 
time, subject to the approval of the lieutenant governor, text books, programme of 
studies, general rules and regulations for the organization and government of all the 
schools and collegiate institutes, together with all other rules which may seem proper 
and appear to enhance the interests of education. (2) To distribute, within certain 
restrictions, the annual appropriation for the purpose of education, to appoint inspectors, 
and to require applicants for teacherships in all the schools to furnish evidence of their 
qualifications, and to prescribe the conditions upon which pupils shall be admitted to the 
high schools and collegiate institutes, &e. 
The law provides for public schools, high schools, collegiate institutes, separate Cath- 
olic and separate colored schools, &e. For the support of these schools the provincial 
parliament makes an annual appropriation, which is divided equally upon the basis of 
attendance at each school. 
The province is divided into school districts, the residents of which are annually taxed 
a certain amount, equal at least to the legislative grant, toward the support of the school 
to which they send their children; but no one is taxed for the support of a school to 
which he or she does not send children. Should the amount realized from the residents 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCLXXxI 
of a school district under this provision not equal the amount apportioned from the legis- 
lative grant, the latter is withheld until an equal sum shall have been raised.“ All chil- 
dren from seven to twelve years of age have the right to attend some school or to be 
otherwise educated four months in each year. A parent or guardian who fails to pro- 
vide for the education of his or her children between the ages adverted to is liable to a 
fine of $5 for the first offence and double that sum for each subsequent offence. 
A petition signed by five Roman Catholics in any school district is the only requisite 
to the establishment of a separate school of that faith and to a share of the annual legis- 
lative grant. 
In the case of colored people twelve names are necessary to a petition in order that 
they may have the privilege of establishing a separate school and the right to a share of 
the grant in question. 
In the public and other schools or institutes the religious feeling of each pupil or student 
is scrupulously respected. In all these it is optional with the pupil or student as to 
whether he or she shall attend any particular religious service not his or her own. 
The teachers in the various schools and institutes. have to undergo. very stringent 
examinations before the central committee, provided for in the act, which awards them 
first, second, or third class certificates, according to their qualification or grade, when 
they shall be deemed* qualified to teach. No one who is not a subject of Her Majesty 
is eligible to teach, no matter what his qualifications. This is law; but I am informed 
by Mr. N. W. Ford, a teacher in the Collegiate Institute at St. Thomas, to whose courtesy 
and laindness I am indebted for the books from which I select the data for this report, 
that any person who can pass the examination is permitted to teach in the province. 
No foreign books are permitted to be used in any model or public school without the 
express permission of the department of education. 
‘The public school year consists of two terms, commencing on the 3d of January and 
ending on the 7th of July, and again on the 18th of August and ending on the 23d of 
December. 
In the rural school sections, which are limited to five miles in length and breadth, 
respectively, there are three trustees to each, elected for three years, or until their suc- 
cessors shall have been elected by the ratepayers thereof. 
In all towns not divided into wards and in all incorporated villages there are six school 
trustees to each town or village. Each town or city divided into wards has two trustees 
to each ward. A trustee cannot be reélected against his own consent until four years 
shall have elapsed from the date of the expiration of his term. . 
The law also provides for a certain number of county, town, and city inspectors, who 
shall be appointed by the county council or city or town school board, as the case may be. 
The county inspectors receive as compensation not less than $5 each | per school annually 
from the county, and an additional $5 each per school per annum from the ‘‘ consolidated 
revenue fund.’? They are also allowed travelling expenses, to be determined by the 
county council. The compensation of the city and town inspectors is determined by the 
board appointing them. 
The schools are variously designated as public schools, high schools, normal or model 
schools, separate Catholic and ‘colored schools, and collegiate institutes. There is a 
high school or collegiate institute in every county or union of counties, but the county 
council can, under certain restrictions, establish more. 
A collegiate institute must have a daily average attendance of sixty male students 
studying Latin and Greek and four masters teaching the same, to entitle it to be classed 
as a ‘‘collegiate institute.” 
The county council has the power, with the approval of.the lieutenant governor, at its 
annual June session, upon the recommendation of the minister of education, to discon- 
tinue any high school within its jurisdiction. 
No person can be appointed head master in a high school or collegiate institute unless 
he shall be a graduate of arts of some university within Her Majesty’s dominions and 
furnishes satisfactory evidence of his knowledge of the science and art of teaching. 
All teachers who, while engaged in the profession, contribute to the “‘superannuated 
teachers’ fund”? are entitled to be retired upon reaching the age of sixty and to receive 
$6 per annum for each year of service, and all teachers under sixty who have contributed 
in like manner and are or may become disabled are entitled to a similar sum, and in cer- 
tain cases those of both ages are entitled to $1 extra per annum for each year as above. 
The high schools, collegiate institutes, and public schools in the same district open 
annually on the 7th day of January and close on the Thursday before Easter, reopen on 
the first Tuesday thereafter and close again on the 13th day of July, reopen on the Ist 
day of September and again close on the 22d of December, thus making three vacations

The admission of pupils to the high schools and collegiate institutes is determined by 
a board of examiners consisting of the county, city, or town inspector of public schools,

the chairman of the public and high school or collegiate institute boards, and the hea@ 
master of the high school or collegiate institute. The questions to be propounded are 
prepared by the ‘‘central committee”? and transmitted by the minister of education to 
the inspector of the city, town, or county, as the case may be, who shall be the chair-

Besides the schools hereinbefore enumerated, there are industrial schools, in which 
children are lodged, clothed, fed, and taught. Any child under the age of fourteen 
years who is destitute, vagrant, unruly, or under the control of vicious parents or guar- 
dians may be brought before a magistrate and sent to an industrial school, but in no case 
for a longer period than until the child shall have attained the age of sixteen years.

Superintendent of public instruction, Gédéon Ouimet. 
Total number of schools of all classes, 4,800, having 6,906 teachers and 238,126 pupils; 
total number of pupils in schools under supervision, 235,574; average attendance, 180,370; 
«total amount levied for public instruction in the province in 1880-’81, $1,997,135. 
Among the measures for the consideration of the legislature the superintendent urges 
the appointment of an inspector general as a means of bringing the superintendent and 
the inspectors into closer relations; the legal requirement that school commissioners and 
trustees shall know how te read; and the engagement of teachers for a period of not less 
than five years. 
The three normal schools were attended during the year by 314 students, of whom 189 
passed the examinations at the end of the year entitling them to diplomas, as follows: 
as teachers for academies, 18; for model schools, 72; for primary schools, 99. 
The polytechnic school of Montreal was founded in 1873 for the purpose of training: 
(1) Civil engineers, capable of conducting, directing, and executing all works of art and 
of construction upon the surface of the soil; (2) mining engineers, capable of conducting, 
directing, and executing all works of discovering, extracting, and working ores and min- 
erals, and their transformation into useful metals; (3) mechanical engineers, capable of 
designing, putting together, and constructing all engines and machines used in manu- 
factures; and (4) industrial engineers, capable of applying the physical and chemical 
sciences to products and manufactures. The course of study extends over five years and 
is calculated to meet all the scientific and industrial requirements of the country. The 
curriculum of the first two years of study is precisely the same for all the pupils, who 
must have a sufficiently extensive knowledge of mathematics, the natural sciences, and 
drawing before commencing the special study of any one of the four branches of civil en- 
* gineering. At the end of the second year the pupil selects the branch which 1 e prefers 
and studies it in a special manner during the last year at the school. From th« opening 
of the polytechnic school until now 33 pupils have matriculated; of these, 11 left for 
various reasons before completing their course, 12 are still at school, and 10 obtained 
the diploma of civil engineer. From the establishment of the school in 1873 to the close 
of the financial year 1879-’80 the total cost of its maintenance was $38,565, of which 
sum the Government contributed $21,000, pupils’ fees amounted to $1,536, and the bal- 
ance was paid by the Catholic commissioners of Montreal, which, with the value of 
grounds, building, and furniture; made a total from the last source of $36,436.

The following account of education is taken from the annual message t) congress (re- 
ceived as this report is going through the press) of Julio A. Roca, president and chief 
executive officer of the republic: 
Receiving aid from the government are 1,505 schools, with 112,400 pupils. This 
does not include normal and model schools and schools annexed to the national colleges.  
-P-A-G-E-273
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCLXXIII 
At the capital there are 170 public and 118 private schools, frequented by 33,190 pupils. 
The figures are not given for the provinces, but previous reports indicate a large number 
of schools, although there is a manifest decrease in proportion to the population. A 
lack of competent professors is reported, and financial embarrassments prevent the estab- 
lishment of as many educational institutions as are needed. Only 13 normal schools 
are mentioned, and, although 4 more are to be started, this will not suffice to prepare as 
many teachers as are required. The attendance at the national colleges in certain prov- 
inees is not what it should be, and many students who desire to enter are not sufficiently 
prepared. For this reason the annexes have been founded in connection with some of 
the colleges. Much improvement is noticeable as a result of these schools. An educa- 
tional commission has been working for some time to place primary instruction on a 
more solid basis. So far this commission has succeeded in arranging for a better admin- 
istration of the school funds, for an inspection of the schools in the provinces where 
there have been difficulties between the authorities, for the erection of spacious and 
hygienically constructed buildings. Other changes for the better are being made in 
various educational institutions supported by the state: some are to be enlarged; others 
farnished with new apparatus; normal schools and universities are having large addi- 
tions made to their various collections; and in some nothing more is required. Satis- 
factory reports are received as regards the instruction in the universities. 
Bazi: constitutional empire: Area, 3,287,964 square miles; population, 9,448,233. Capital, Rio de

Public education is divided into three distinct forms or classes: primary, secondary 
or preparatory, and scientific or superior. According to the constitution, primary in- 
struction is gratuitous and will some time become compulsory. Education is still in a 
backward state and no statistics can be given, but the following statement indicates a 
tendency towards progress: Since the termination of the war with Paraguay a general 
awakcning on the part of the state authorities, private institutions, &c., as to the needs . 
of Brazil in respect to education has been perceptible. No effort has been spared within 
the last few years to develop public instruction and large expenditures have been 
made towards that end. An examination of the annual budget shows an increase of 
funds voted from year to year by the government for the purposes of superior instruc- 
tion throughout the various provinces. Large sums have also been voted for primary 
and secondary education at Rio de Janeiro. According to the constitution, superior in- 
structio:. in the provinces and both primary and secondary at the capital depend on 
the amoants voted by the general government. The various ministers since the war 
with Parpguay have done much towards modifying the methods of instruction in Rio de 
Janeiro. | Many school-houses have been erected, the latest furnishings and apparatus 
added; new schools established; collections for object teaching organized; translations 
into Porvuguese made of the best text books used in the schools of France, Germany, 
and the United States; the position of primary teachers improved, &c. The result is 
that teachers do better work, the attendance of pupils has been looked after, and the 
schools generally rank higher. Pupils have also been aided to get school books and the 
necessary apparatus so as to advance in their studies. 
Cum, republic: Area, about 300,000 square miles; population (January 1, 1880), 2,193,434. 
Public education in Chili is divided into primary, secondary, and superior. The free 
public schools in 1880-’81 numbered 638, divided into 114 city schools for boys and 141 
for girls, and 101 country schools for boys and 264 for girls; 18 schools were added during 
the year, making the total as above. The number of children enrolled in the public 
schools was 24,961 boys and 23,833 girls—total, 48,794; average attendance, 34,089. 
To this must be added the private and society schools, numbering 405, with 15,106 
scholars: 9,218 boys and 5,888 girls. The total number of public and private schools

‘was therefore 1,043. There are 4 normal schools to supply teachers for these schools. 
Tn 1881 congress appropriated $1,119,620 for school purposes. The higher and inter- 
mediate or secondary schools are free and have their own buildings, apparatus, &c. The 
principal one, founded at Santiago in 1813, is called the National Institute. In the prov- 
inces these schools take the name of liceos or high schools. The university preparatory 
course in the National Institute in 1880 had 843 students, distributed as follows: Physi- 
cal sciences and mathematics, 34; medicine, 263; law, 389; pharmacy, 86; drawing, 
painting, and sculpture, 71. The 17 high schools in the provinces had 2,176 students, 
and there were 918 enrolled in the intermediate course at the institute, making a total 
of 3,937 of this class of students. 
The university at Santiago has 5 faculties (law, medicine and surgery, engineering 
and architecture, theology, and philology). The number of students at the university 
in 1880 was 724. The high schools give instruction in Latin, French, English, general 
history, and history of Chili and America, philosophy, literature and history of litera- 
‘ture, physical geography, physics and chemistry, mathematics, drawing, natural history, 
and book-keeping. In the schools in the mining districts the application of physics and 
chemistry to mining and metallurgy is taught, and in commercial centres suitable instruc- 
tion is given to prepare students for active life. There are also an agricultural school, a 
technical school, and a school of fine arts. 
In Santiago is the national library, with more than 60,000 volumes. The university, 
institute, and many private schools as well as the provincial schools have excellent libra- 
ries also. In Santiago and Valparaiso there are museums of natural Seey) and in Serena 
and Copiapo, museums of mineralogy. 
Unirep States or CoLomsta, federal republic: Area, 504,773 English square miles; population 
(in 1870), 2,951,823. 
  This confederation of nine states has its primary, secondary, and superior instruction 
under the direction of a secretary of state, who is a part of the federal ministry. Eachstate 
has also a director of public instruction, as an officer of the ministry, and each director 
has at his orders as many superintendents as there are departments in each state. Each 
department is divided into districts, in each of which the educational affairs come under 
charge of a school commission composed of 3 members named by the superintendent. This 
commission watches over the school attendance, which is obligatory for all children between 
Sand 14 years of age, attends to the e&tablishment of new schools in rural districts, over- 
sees the monthly examinations for promotion, and presents the requisite reports to the 
superintendent. This system of public instruction was established in 1870. Normal 
schools were founded throughout the confederation, and the schools generally were 
arranged as lay institutions. A revolt on the part of those desiring religious instruction 
in the schools, in 1876, was soon quelled, and the lay schools are continued. The course 
of studies in the primary grades comprises reading, writing, arithmetic, national and 
universal geography, history, agriculture, botany, zodlogy, French, English, German, 
Spanish, and military exercises. The primary schools number 1,500; pupils, 75,000. 
Numerous private schools are also reported, Bogota alone, with a population of 100,000, 
having 22. The National University, the military school, and schools of architecture, 
painting, and music are at Bogota; gue school of mines is at Antioquia; the naval school, 
at Carthagena.

The following information is derived from the annual report for 1881 : 
School attendance.— Average monthly enrolment in public and provisional schools, 
27,961; average attendance, 20,653, Average monthly attendance of scholars holding

free certificates, 2,220. Number of teachers at the close of the year, 786 ; percentages 
of pupils passed at inspector’s examination: publie schools, 69.87; provisional schools, 
61.77; infant departments, 84.40. Average duration of: schools, public, 225.5 days; pro- 
visional, 224.1 days. 
The number of night schools open during the year was 73 for an average of 69 nights 
each; average monthly attendance, 1,360 ; amount of fees received from scholars, 5900. 12s. ; 
bonus paid by department, 7227. 15s. 3d. The advanced school for girls had an attend- 
ance of 98 during the last quarter of the year, being an increase of 21 over the number 
for 1880. 
The report of the training college shows that 41 pupils were admitted in January, of 
whom 36, viz, 23 men and 13 women, completed the course. At the certificate exami- 
nation, held in December, all the students, except one who was ill, were presented and 
‘were successful. 
Cost of education.— The average cost for each child instructed during the year was 
1l. 14s. 0}d., and for each child in average attendance, 37. 0s. 10}d. If the expenses of 
management and inspection be added, these rates will be 1J. 18s. 0fd. and 31. 7s. 11jd., 
respectively. The amount of school fees paid by the parents was 19,7361. 13s. 6d., of 
which sum 13,119/. 14s. 11d. were retained by the teachers of public and provisional 
schools. The same teachers received from the department 1,319. 13s. 4d. on account of 
scholars whose fees are paid by the state. 
The total amount expended in school buildings was 31,4871. 8s. 8d. The total cost of 
public instruction during the year 1881, exclusive of the expenditure on school buildings, 
was 91,410/. 17s. 1d.; the revenue in aid of the foregoing expenditure, derived from the 
rents of dedicated lands and other sources, was 19,5501. 16s. 5d., showing the net cost 
to the state to be 71,8601. 0s. 8d. The total area of lands dedicated for educational pur- 
poses amounted on the 15th of December to 241,538} acres. 
Compulsion.— Under the operation of the compulsory act the percentage of children 
absent without a satisfactory reason shows a steady decline.

My report for 1880 gives particulars of the public instruction act which went into 
operation May 1, 1880, together with a somewhat detailed account of the progress of the 
system for that year. No later report has been received from the colony. 
Sydney University.— New South Wales was the first colony in Australasia to found a 
university. It was incorporated by act of Parliament in 1851 and is constituted on the 
model of the British universities. It is sapported by the state, and up to the present 
time has cost in buildings and endowments ever 200,0002. The object of its founders 
was to offer the highest forms of culture to all, ‘‘ without any distinction whatsoever.” 
The university receives an assured government endowment of 5,000/. a year, and each 
of the colleges 500J. for salary of a principal. About 50,0007. have been bestowed upon 
the university by wealthy colonists for scholarships and prizes, and recently 180,000/. 
were bequeathed to it by the late Mr. J. H. Challis. By a royal charter graduates are 
entitled ‘‘to the same rank, title, and precedence as graduates of universities within the 
United Kingdom.”’ 
Large grants have been given to supplement private subscriptions for the affiliated col- 
leges within the university, of which there are now three: the Anglican College of St. 
Paul, Roman Catholic College of St. John, and the Presbyterian College of St. Andrew. 
‘There are several other colleges erected and maintained at great expense by the Church of 
England, the Roman Catholic Church, and other denominations. 
The secondary educational institutions include several of high character, among which 
are the Technical or Workingmen’s College and the Sydney Grammar School.

RECOMMENDATIONS. 
  I have had the honor in previous reports to recommend that provision be made, by 
resolution of Congress, for the publication of 15,000 copies of this annual report. The 
correspondence of the Office has so increased that this number should now be made 
20,000 copies, and whatever Congress may deem best to distribute under the personal 
direction of members should be in addition to this number. 
The organization of the educational museum which I have had the honor to recom- 
mend, now fairly commenced, should have sufficient appropriation to enable it, by 
exchange and otherwise, to supply similar collections in the offices of the several State 
superintendents and the leading cities when desired. There can be no question of the 
effective aid these collections would render to the progress of education. Through this 
Office the best illustrations of improved appliances could be, collected and distributed to 
all parts of the country. 
The reports of efforts to educate the youth of 30,000 Alaskans continually disclose the 
embarrassments arising from all absence of local ‘administration of law. It is said the 
-parents are disposed to have their children taught and the pupils learn readily, but it is 
clear there can be no satisfactory success, that the entire youth cannot be reached, until 
same form of law is provided for the organization of society. The pledges of the past 
and the honor of the nation would seem to permit no delay. Some inexpensive form of 
organization can be devised, and an appropriation of $50,000, it is believed, would give 
the work of education an excellent start, and is earnestly recommended. 
The remaining recommendations I have the honor most earnestly to renew: 
(1) I recommend that the office of superintendent of public instruction for each Terri- 
tory be created, to be filled by appointment by the President, the compensation to be 
fixed and paid as in the case of other Federal appointees for the Territories. 
(2) In view of the large number of children growing up in ignorance on account of the 
impoverished condition of portions of the country, and in view of the special difficulties 
in the way of establishing and maintaining therein schools for universal education, and 
in consideration of the imperative need of immediate action in this regard, I reeommend 
that the whole or a portion of the net proceeds arising from the sale of public lands be 
set aside as a special fund, the interest of said fund to be divided annually pro rata 
among the several States and Territories and the District of Columbia, under such pro- 
visions in regard to amount, allotment, expenditure, and supervision as Congress in its 
wisdom may deem fit and proper. 
The returns of the last census emphasize the importance of this reeommendation. The 
per cent. of illiteracy of persons 10 years of age and upward has decreased from 20.05 in
-P-A-G-E-277
CONCLUSION. CCLXXVII 
  1870 to 17 in 1880, but the number of illiterates over 10 years of age has increased from 
5,658, 144 to 6,239,958 in the same period. 
(3) I recommend the enactment of a law requiring that all facts in regard to national 
aid to education and all facts in regard to education in the Territories and the District 
of Columbia necessary for the information of Congress be presented through this Office. 
(4) I recommend an increase of the permanent force of the Office. The experience of 
the Office indicates clearly that the collection of educational information and publication 
of the same, as required by the law regulating it, cannot be properly done with the 
present limited clerical force. 
CONCLUSION. 
I take pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to the faithful laborers in the Office 
and to all others elsewhere who have contributed to the success of its work. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Commissioner.

PREFATORY NOTE. 
  The following abstracts of education in the Statesand Territories are derived from a great variet: of sources, First among these come reports of State officials, such as State boards of education an State superintendents of instruction; next, those of county and city superintendents, school com- mittees, acting school visitors, and principals of State institutions. From these is derived nearly all the information given respecting elementary and special instruction, city school systems, and nor- mal schools, and much of that relating to secondary schools, as the high schools of the States and cities. What concerns private secondary schools is almost wholly from returns made by the princi- pals of these to the Bureau of Education, supplemented by catalogues and other documents, For the matter relating to universities, colleges, and scientific and professional schools, depend- ‘ence is placed on the annual catalogues of these institutions, on occasional circulars issued by them, and on special returns, made usually in the autumnal and ‘winter months, in reply to circulars of inquiry sent them by the Bureau. In every instance, official authority only is relied upon for statements distinctly and definitely made, the printed catalogues and reports being chiefly used for this purpose, though sometimes an item of interesting information from other than official sources may be given, with a referenee to the quarter from which it is derived. In such cases, however, the eifort is always made to verify the statement before it is committed to the press.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
There are State and county superintendents of education, township superintendents of 
public schools, and county boards of education. These last are composed of the county 
superintendent and two teachers associated with him for the purpose of examining 
teachers and conducting teachers’ institutes.— (Constitution and laws.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
To sustain the schools there are the funds supplied from the State treasury, from op- 
tional local taxes in each county (except Mobile) of not over 10 cents on the $100, and 
from a poll tax of $1.50 on each male 21 to 45 years of age. Half the proceeds of the 
county tax must be used for the pay of teachers. School moneys are distributed accord- 
ing to the enumeration of children between 7 and 21 years in each county, but no de- 
nominational schools are to receive any. Separate schools for each race are to be main- 
tained by the school authorities. The scholastic month is 20 days of 6 hours each. To 
receive their pay, teachers are required to be duly licensed, to be members of the county 
institute for their race (which they must attend once annually), and to furnish quarterly 
reports to the county superintendent of education.— (Constitution and laws of 1879.) 
,» GENERAL CONDITION. 
The State superintendent of education reports steady and gratifying progress and im- 
provement in free education within the year, yet the statistics furnished indicate a slight 
decrease in enrolment and average daily attendance, in thenumber of schools, and in the 
pupils in spelling, reading, and writing. There were, however, 35 more school districts 
reported, 83 more teachers employed, 9,653 more students in arithmetic and 42 more in 
geography. The average length of schools in days was 81.21, against 80 last year. The 
average monthly pay of teachers of white schools was reported as lower than that of colored 
teachers, being $22.98 in the former case and $23.15 in the latter. Mr. Armstrong adds 
that either the salaries of the teachers of white schools in almost every school district in 
the State were increased or the schools continued a longer term than stated. Thenumber 
of school-houses in 1881 was said to be 1,297; their value, $285,976; number of visits by 
county superintendents to schools, 2,361; number of institutes held, 89. These statistics 
are very imperfect, as but few of the counties reported. _The total-receipts forschool pur- 
poses increased $9,466, and the expenditures $35,225. It is thought that the receipts of 
the sixteenth section capital fund will be largely increased in 1882, as the legislature passed 
an act authorizing a compromise and settlement of certain claims, and the results in 1881 
promise well for the school fund of the future. An act of the legislature providing for 
graded certificates of license for teachers, and requiring rigid written examinations to pro- 
cure them, will, it is said, reduce the number of schools temporarily as well as exclude 
from the schools worthless and inefficient teachers.— (State report. ) 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For any schools of this class reporting for 1881, reference is made to Table V of the 
appendix, 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
The amount received from this source for the year ending September 30, 1881, was 
$1,800. It paid for nine scholarships in the Nashville (Tenn.) Normal College. Promise 
was made of $5,000 for the following year.— (State report.)

REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Mobile (including both city and county schools) reports 41 school districts; 60 schools 
for whites and 36 for colored; general average length of white and colored schools, 166 days; 
the schools visited 300 times by the county superintendent; 73 school-houses, valued, with 
school furniture, apparatus, &c., at $108,700; the average‘monthly pay of teachers for 
the white schools, $41.25; for the colored schools, $40.90; average cost of pupil a month, 
84 cents. The total school population was 23,865, that for the city alone not being 
given. The number of pupils studying orthography was 5,040; reading and writing, 
5,050 each; arithmetic, 4,985; geography, 3,679; grammar, 2,384, all but 86 white; 
history, 2,055, all white.— (State report. ) 
Montgomery’ reports 1 school district, in which 7 white and5 colored schools were taught 
an average of 160 days. The enrolment was divided into 351 white and 644 colored pu- 
pils; the attendance, into 160 white and 328 colored.— (State report. ) 
Selma received a total of $1,612 to maintain the 8 white and 6 colored schools taught 
in 1881 in the school district. The average length of school in days was 195; daily at- 
tendance, whites 428, colored 258. One school building, valued, with furniture, appara- 
tus, &c., ‘at $5,500, is reported. The county superintendent of schools made 4 visits 
during the year.— “(State report.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The State Normal School, Florence, reported 8 resident instructors, 68 normal and 111 
other students present in 1880-’81. The State appropriation for the year was $7,500; 
graduates, 4; of these 3 are engaged in teaching. ‘The full course occupies 3 years. A 
model school is connected with the institution, and a chemical laboratory is mentioned. 
‘The Peabody fund trustees aid this school to the amount of $2,000 a year, which is equiv- 
alent to 16 scholarships.— (Return and catalogue. ) 
The State Normal School for the Education of Colored Teachers, Huntsville, had an en- 
rolment of 133 pupils and an average attendance of 94 during 1880-’81. Four gradu- 
ates are already occupying teachers’ positions. The 4 years’ course includes the ordinary 
branches, book-keeping, and vocal andinstrumental music. Four educational journals and 
magazines are taken.— (Return, State report.) 
The Lincoln Normal University, Marion, also has a 4 years’ course, the completion of 
which entitles the graduate to teach in the common schools of the State or city without 
further examination. There were 222 students in 1880-81, an increase of 25 per cent. 
over the preceding year. The standard for graduation has been raised from 80 to 85; 
pupils have been more regular in attendance and have remained longer in school than 
formerly. A library was commenced by the students during the year, and 100 or more 
books were purchased. Eight graduates have become teachers. The aim of the school, 
to prepare intelligent, upright, and moral teachers of the colored race, is being attained.— 
(Return, State report.) 
The Zuskegee Normal School, for colored students, reports 112 students engaged in nor- 
mal studies in a 4 years’ course, under 4 non-resident instructors. Tuition is free. The 
institution was granted an appropriation of $2,000 by the State and received $5,000 from 
private sources. Drawing and vocal music are taught, and there is a library of 500 
volumes. The school was organized in 1881. 
  OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS. 
These were the Rust Normal Institute, Huntsville, which reported 2 teachers and 111 
pupils in 1881, and a steady growth in popularity; the Emerson Institute, Mobile, report- 
ing 36 students in the 4 years’ normal course, vocal and instrumental music taught; the 
Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School, Selma, 63 normal pupils, a3 years’ course 
of study, vocal and instrumental music included in the course; and the normal depart- 
ment of Talladega College, which had'48 normal pupils in the 4 years’ course, one of the 
2 graduates having already become a teacher.— (Catalogues and returns, report of Freed- 
men’s Aid Society, Methodist Advocate. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
By laws of 1879 boards of education were required to organize and maintain teachers’ 
institutes in their respective counties. Separate institutes for white and colored persons 
are to be held, provided not less than ten licensed teachers of the race are found in the 
county. Every licensed teacher must be a member of such institute and must attend 
at least one of the annual meetings. There were 89 institutes reported in the various 
counties during 1881. The attendance is not mentioned.— (Laws and State report.)

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, has within the last two years revised and ex- 
tended its curriculum and elevated the standard of graduation. In the academic de- 
partment there are three courses of instruction: scientific, classical, and eclectic. Can- 
didates for degrees must take either the full scientific or the classical course, each of 
which requires 4 years’ study, but students are received in any of the nine-schools and 
are entitled to diplomas on graduating from any school they may enter. There were 143 
students reported in 1881, outside of those in professional schools. The degrees in course 
conferred were M. A., 16, “and 3. A., 10.— (State report, catalogue, and return.) 
The Southern University ty, Greensboro’, and Howard College, Marion, are also arranged in 
schools, the former having 7, the latter, 11. The first mentioned gives preparatory in- 
struction prior to the four years’ classical and three years’ scientific school. There is 
also a master’s course of one year. The legal and medical departments were not in 
operation during the year. Howard College has a regular classical course, gives the 
degree of B. S., teaches book-keeping, and reports schools of engineering and of military 
art and science. Spring Hill College, Mobile, last- heard from in 1878-79, commenced. 
with the grammar grade and advanced through the classics. Anew college, the William 
and Emma Austin College, Stevenson, is arranged for the education of both sexes. The 
studies begin with the primary grades, and Kindergarten training is also mentioned. 
The five schools for the college proper include English history, natural sciences, mathe- 
matics, ancient languages, and philosophy. Whether the collegiate department is yet 
in operation is not known.— (Catalogues and returns. )

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College, Auburn, has 5 regular degree courses, 
viz: scientific agriculture, leading to B. Ss. A.; civil engineering, B. C. E.; mining engi- 
neering, B. M. E.; literature, A. B.; science, B. $. Each of these courses occupies 4 years, 
but for the first two years the studies are identical. More than 1,000 young men have 
already been instructed here. Eleven instructors were reported in ig8i and 136 students. 
In the preparatory department 47 students, under the charge of 1 teacher, were reported.— 
(State report, catalogue, and return.) 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction is furnished by the Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological 
Institute, Selma, which has a 3 years’ course and reported 30 students in 1881; by the 
Talladega Theological Seminary, Congregational, reporting 11 students in the 3 years’ 
course; and by the Institute for Training Colored Ministers, a Presbyterian school at 
Tuscaloosa, which reported 17 students in 1881 in a 5 years’ course and 3 graduates. All 
these schools require an examination for admission.— (Returns. ) 
Legal training is given in the law department of the University of Alabama, at Tus- 
caloosa. The course may be completed in nine months. The instruction takes in inter- 
national and constitutional law, common and statute law, and equity jurisprudence. 
There were 20 students reported in 1881 and 13 graduates.— (Catalogue and returns.) 
The law department of the Southern University was suspended in 1881.

3 - REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The Medical College of Alabama, Mobile, requires an examination for admission, while 
for graduation the students must have attended 2 courses of lectures of 20 weeks each 
and have pursued the usual 3 years’ course of study. Chemical laboratory work is not 
obligatory, but a knowledge of medical botany is essential to a diploma. There were 
60 students in 1881.— (Catalogue and return.) 
The medical department of Southern University was suspended in 1881. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Alabama Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Talladega, has a com- 
plete corps of instructors in both departments and offers accommodations for one hun- 
dred persons, although only 50 pupils were in attendance during the year 1881. The 
‘ordinary branches of a practical English education are taught here, also shoemaking, 
cane seating, mattress making, printing, plumbing, and gas fitting. Articulation does 
not enter into the course. Agriculture is one of the pursuits in which training is given.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent is elected biennially by the people, and there is a board of 
commissioners of the common school fund, composed of the governor, secretary of state, 
and superintendent of schools, the last acting as secretary of the board. Local officers 
are county examiners, appointed by the county courts, and district directors, elected by 
the people, the latter for terms of three years, one going out each year. 
Public schools are sustained from the income of the State school fund and a per cap- 
ita tax of $1 on males over 21, together with such appropriation as the legislature may 
set apart. The optional district taxes allowed are limited by law to one-half of 1 per 
cent. on the assessed valuation. The minimum school term is three months; district 
directors determine how much longer it may be made, and, in case the revenues of a 
district in any year are not suflicient for a three months’ school, voters of the district 
may determine that no school shall be taught during such year. Public funds are appor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  10 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
tioned to districts on the basis of residents 6-21 therein. District directors must make 
annual report of school statistics to examiners, and the latter to the State superintend- 
ent. A failure on the part of directors involves loss to the district of public school 
money due, and directors are personally liable for such loss. White and colored youth 
must be taught in separate schools. The use of sectarian books in the public schools is 
forbidden by law. Provision is made for teachers’ institutes, to be held by examiners 
in each county and by the State superintendent in each judicial district, schools to be 
closed during the sessions and teachers to attend the institutes, receiving pay as usual. 
Teachers must also attend the quarterly examinations held by the county examiner and 
must hold a license from him to teach in order to receive pay from public funds.— (School 
laws, 1875.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The reports of this State being biennial, very little information has been received in 
regard to the public schools later than that given by the State report for 1879 and 1880. 
The above statistical summary, from figures kindly furnished the Office by the State 
superintendent shows, however, that the very large increase of school youth (25,294) was 
more than met by a great addition (27,772) to the public school enrolment; that, to pro- 
vide for this addition, there were 342 more teachers employed and 387 more school- 
houses used; that the value of school property was thus increased by $84,517 and the 
public school expenditures by $150,356; and that, though the average monthly pay of 
teachers generally is not given, it was both more liberal than in many former years and 
was fairly proportioned to the qualifications of the teachers as indicated by the certifi- 
cates they held. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
LITTLE ROCK. 
Officers. — A board. of school directors of 6 members, elected for 3 years, 2 going out each 
year, and a superintendent appointed by the board. 
Statistics.— Population of the city, 13,138; white youth of school age, 3,216 ; colored 
youth, 2,072 ; enrolment in public schools, 1,768 white and 870 colored pupils ; total en- 
rolment, 2,638, an increase of 135 for the year; average daily attendance, 1,680; per 
cent. of enrolment on school population, whites 55, colored 42; number of teachers, 
34; the schools were taught 173 days; expenditure for public school purposes, $31,872. 
Additional particulars.— The superintendent reports satisfactory progress, althodgh the 
Jower grades were too crowded to give the best results; he enlarges on the special 
importance of improving these, since a majority of pupils do notgo beyond the fifth 
year. The grades are primary, grammar, and high, each covering 4 years, but the su- 
perintendent adviseg that another year be added below the high schools. Of these there 
are 2, one for each race, that for whites having an average enrolment of 68, with 60 in 
- average attendance ; that for colored an average enrolment of 42, with 37 in average at- 
tendance.— (City report and return.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. i 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS. 
A normal departmentin the Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville, offers facilities 
for the training of white youth, and a branch normal at Pine Bluff the same for colored. 
Tn each school there are 237 State scholarships, entitling the holders to free tuition for 
the entire course of 4 years. The department at Fayetteville had 82 pupils during 
1880-’81, and the branch normal at Pine Bluff, 123, who, besides othér instruction, 
were trained in methods of teaching, school organization, grading and government, 
and duties of teachers under the school law. The branch normal reports very satisfac- 
tory progress during the year in all grades, and the attendance better than ever before, 
making necessary a new building, which was in process of erection. 
Normal instruction is also given to colored youth in Southland College and Normal 
Institute, near Helena, a school under the direction of Friends. It was organized as 
anormal institute in 1869, and has since sent out as teachers 12 graduates from the col- 
legiate and 4 from the normal department, besides 160 other students. A normal course 
is reported by Judson University, Judsonia. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
  In the absence of any State school report for the year no statistics can be given regard- 
ing either the county teachers’ institutes, required by law to be held in each county by 
the examiner, or the district institutes, required to be held in each judicial district by 
the State superintendent. It appears, however, that at least 1 county and 4 district 
institutes were held during 1881, and others were advertised in the Arkansas Journal. 
At the district institutes reported, the addresses were generally confined to practical
-P-A-G-E-289
  
  ARKANSAS. 11 
educational topics, and it is said they did much to inspire and energize teachers, to 
arouse interest in free schools, and to remove popular prejudice against them.— (Ar- 
kansas School Journal.) 
SCHOOL JOURNAL. 
The Arkansas School Journal, a monthly published at Little Rock since November, 
1880, gives teachers hearty support and encouragement, as well as educational infor- 
mation, and makes such criticisms on school work as may appear to be called for. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The number of public high schools cannot be given; only 4 are known to be in op- 
eration: 2 at Little Rock, 1 at Bentonville, and 1 in Searcy; and only from the first 2 
have reports been received for 1880-81. Of these the Sherman High School for white 
pupils had an average of 68 enrolled, and the Union High School for colored an average 
of 42. The reports from both were satisfactory, as far as particulars were given. In 
that for colored pupils the attendance was better than for the year before and the disci- 
pline was good. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For the names and statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and pre- 
paratory departments of colleges or universities, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appen- 
-dix, and for a summary of their statistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville, with property valued at about 
$300,000 and 441 pupils in all departments, is making substantial progress. A decided 
advance in the requirements for admission appears from a comparison of the catalogue 
for 1880 with the preceding one, and that for 1881 shows that the standard of work for 
graduation has been raised. Further efforts have also been made to bring the institution 
within the reach of students with small means: 60 free scholarships have been offered 
to indigent students throughout the State, additional to the 350 beneficiaries and 237 
holders of normal scholarships whose appointments are made by county judges, and the 
old university building has been fitted up as asteward’s hall for the purpose of furnishing 
board at reduced rates. Besides preparatory, musical, and medical departments, there are 
9 undergraduate courses, including classical, Latin letters, English letters, modern lan- 
guages, a normal department, and a general scientific and three technical scientific 
courses.— (Catalogue, 1880-81.) = 
Besides the State University, 3 institutions of collegiate rank in this State have reported 
for 1880~’81 or for the previous year, viz: Cane Hill College, Boonsboro’; Judson Uni- 
versity, Judsonia; and St. John’s College, Little Rock. There is no information from 
Arkansas College, Batesville, later than for 1878. In the 3 colleges reporting, both 
sexes are admitted on equal terms. All have preparatory and 2 of them even primary 
departments, and all have the equivalent of classical courses, although in Judson Univer- 
sity and St. John’s College the curriculum is arranged in independent schools. Two 
have general scientific courses, 1 adding engineering. Cane Hill College presents a 
3 years’ collegiate course for such young women as prefer it to the regular one. All offer 
instruction in music, 1 in art, and 2 in commercial branches. 
It is reported that the Methodist Episcopal Church proposes to establish a university 
at Little Rock, that ground has been purchased for a site on which a building is to be 
erected during 1882, and that the college of letters and of sciences will be opened in Octo- 
ber. The other colleges contemplated are of commerce, law, music, and art, and a nor- 
mal college.— (Arkansas School Journal.) 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
A course in general sciences exists in the Industrial University, St. John’s College, and 
Judson University. Cane Hill College offers a 3 years’ course in civil engineering. 
The Industrial University has 4 years’ courses in civil and mining engineering and 
in agriculture; the engineering students have a special preliminary training in English, 
French, German, mathematics, and drawing, extending over 2 preparatory years and 
the first college year, the scientific work proper beginning with the second collegiate 
year. Surveyors’ and engineers’ field instruments of the best construction are furnished 
for the instruction of students, who are required to use them in actual work. Military 
drill and tactics form a part of the course for all able-bodied male students of the univer-
-P-A-G-E-290

sity. Students laboring on the farm are remunerated as far as the finances will permit, 
from 8 to 10 cents an hour being paid.— (Catalogue, 1880-’81.) 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The only professional school reporting is the medical department of the Arkansas In- 
dustrial University, Little Rock. Organized in 1879-80, it had an attendance of 32 
during its second year, and graduated 10. The required course of study is the old one, 
comprising 3 years under a regular practitioner and including 2 courses of lectures of 
5 months each. There is also a voluntary graded course of 3 years.— (University cata- 
logue, 1881-82.) 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
Instruction is given to the deaf at the Arkansas Deaf-Mute Institute, Little Rock, 
which receives pupils between 9 and 30, giving board and tuition at public expense. 
Pupils are instructed in the common English branches, also in coopering, shoemaking, 
out door and house work, and sewing. Articulation and lip reading is used in the 
instruction of those who have retained some power of speech, but the main reliance is 
on the sign language. There were 74 students in 1881 under 5 instructors. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Arkansas School for the Blind, Little Rock, a free school maintained by the State 
for the education of the blind, is open by law to all of this class of suitable charac- 
ter and capacity between 6 and 26 years of age, but the actual number is limited by lack 
of funds. Pupils receive not only tuition, but board, washing, medical attention, and 
the use of books, without charge. All branches of a good English education are taught, 
also music, calisthenics, and piano tuning, besides such employments as broom and mat- 
tress making, upholstery, chair seating, sewing by hand and machine, and fancy work. 
There were 36 pupils in the school during the year 1880-81, a slight gain over former 
years.— (Return, 1880~’81, and printed report, 1880.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The State Teachers’ Association held its annual meeting at Russellville, July 5-8, 
1881. There was a fair attendance, 50 teachers being enrolled as members, besides a 
large number of citizens of Russellville present. The teachers were generously enter- 
tained by the citizens, who also rendered important aid by furnishing excellent music at 
the evening meetings. The programme was in the main carried out, although several 
teachers who were on it failed to appear. The annual address of the president, F. W. 
Hays, was practical in character, and the papers and discussions were in the main interest- 
ing and fruitful. During the evening sessions addresses were delivered by prominent 
educators, including Mr. J. M. Fish, superintendent of the Little Rock schools; Major 
J. B. Merwin, of the American Journal of Education, St. Louis, Mo.; and the State super- 
intendent, Hon. J. L. Denton, who spoke on public education in Arkansas. Among 
the resolutions passed was one indorsing the importance and effectiveness of the super- 
intendent’s work and pledging him the codperation of members of the association in his 
efforts to popularize free education.— (Arkansas School Journal, July, 1881.)

14 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
These consist of a State superintendent of public instruction; a State board of edu- 
cation, of which the superintendent is secretary, and which acts as a State board of ex- 
amination; county superintendents of schools, with county boards of education acting 
as boards of examination ; city superintendents; city boards of education and of ex- 
amination; “and school district trustees, 3 for every rural district, serving each for 3 
years, with annual change of 1. Up to 1880, State and county boards of examination 
existed; now the boards of education act as such. Formerly a city was obliged to have 
a board of examination; now it is optional. Women, by act of March 12, 1874, are 
eligible to all school offices except those from which they are debarred by the constitution. 
  OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are to be sustained by a State poll tax of $2 on each voter, a county 
tax not to exceed 50 cents on $100 of taxable property, and a district tax not to exceed 
‘70 cents for building school-houses or 30 cents for other school purposes. The State 
school funds, except the 10 per cent. reserved for district school libraries, must be ap- 
plied exclusively to the payment of teachers of the primary and grammar grades, the 
higher schools allowed by law being sustained by their respective communities, under 
the direction of the local boards. 
To receive its apportionment of the public moneys a district must have maintained a 
school during the preceding school year for at least 6 months and the teacher must hold 
@ legal certificate of qualification. The schools must be non-sectarian. Text books are 
chosen by the local boards. Books having been adopted, no change can be made under 4 
years, and any city or district using others forfeits 25 per cent. of the State school mon- 
eys to which it may be entitled until it complies. The course of instruction includes 
vocal music, elements of book-keeping, industrial drawing, manners, morals, and physi- 
cal exercise. Teachers must be duly licensed by the local boards and have attained 18 
years of age. The number of children entitled to free instruction is to be determined 
by an annual census. All between 6 and 21 are admitted to the schools free, while the 
basis of apportionment is 5 to17. All having charge of children between 8 and 14 are 
required to send them to a public school at least two-thirds of the time during which 
schoolsare taught. The discrimination against Indians and Chinese as pupilsin the public 
schools formerly made has been dropped in the later editions of the law, though they are 
still excluded from the benefits of the public funds, except where the Indian children are 
under the guardianship of white persons. Female teachers in the public schools over 
21 years of age holding the same grade certificates and doing like services as men aré 
to receive the same pay. Women over the age of 21 are eligible to educational offices. 
‘The public school system includes primary, grammar, high, evening, technical, and nor- 
mal schools, and teachers’ institutes; the State school tax, however, is applied exclusively 
to the support of primary and grammar grades. The school month is 20 days. 
A State university, non-political, non-sectarian, and open for both sexes, completes the 
system. At least one college of agriculture and mechanic arts is to be sustained by the 
revenue from the agricultural college grant, in connection with the university.— (School 
laws, 1881.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
In the absence of the annual report for 1880-’81 only a meagre comparison with 1879-’80 
can be made. The fewitems at hand indicate general progress. Notwithstanding a fall- 
ing off of 4,741 in youth of school age, there was a gain of 5,090 in enrolment and of 
4,575 in average daily attendance. The average time of school, however, was shortened 
nearly 32 days. There was a total gain of 142 teachers, 152 more of the teachers being 
females. The average monthly pay of men, although slightly decreased during @he year, 
remained $14.76 higher than that of women. The only other items show an increase of 
$107,053 in receipts for public schools and of $183,034 in expenditures, but a falling off of 
$16,400 in the available fund. 2 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Private information from one in a position to be well informed indicates the existence 
of at least 15 of these excellent means of primary instruction, one of them at Oakland, 
most of the others at San Francisco. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
In each city in the State having a board of education there may be a board of exami- 
nation or the board of education may act as such. In each city of over 30,000 inhabitants 
the superintendent is allowed a deputy.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Los Angeles reports school buildings, grounds, apparatus, &c., worth $64,500. The 
high school building is a handsome structure; the school has scientific, literary, and clas- 
sical courses, occupying 4 years each, in which students are prepared to enter the corre- 
sponding courses in the State University; it enrolled 100 pupils. There were 6 primary 
and 3 grammar schools; the two grades had a course of 8 years. The pupils were taught 
to collect minerals, insects, shells, and other curiosities, and arrange them in little cabi- 
nets, thus cultivating their faculty of observation and awakening and sustaining a high 
degree of enthusiasm. One special teacher in drawing was employed. There are 14 
school buildings, valued, with sites, furniture, and apparatus, at $64,500. In private 
and ee schools, there were 518 enrolled; attending no school, 1,001.— (Return and 
city report. 
Oakland had 17 school buildings, containing 127 rooms for study and recitation, with 
6,462 sittings; Shoo property was valued at$364,825. The primary schools were taught 
in 72 rooms; the grammar and evening, in 47; the high, in 8. Of the 137 teachers, 74 
were in the primary department, 49 in the grammar, 9 in the high, 2 in the evening 
school, and 3 were teachers of music and drawing. The attendance was uniform and 
reached nearly 96 per cent. of average daily attendance on average belonging. The high 
school has 3 optional courses of study, the scientific, literary, and classical, each covering 
3 years. The school numbered 352 pupils, reached 98.3 per cent. of average daily at- 
tendance on average belonging, and graduated 55. Music and drawing were taught in 
all the grades. The evening school enrolled 154 pupils averaging 18 years of age; all but 
9 were workmen in factories. Discipline was improved and truancy much reduced. 
Schools were taught 205 days. There was an enrolment of 1,000 in private schools.— 
(Return and city report.) 
San Francisco reported 70 school buildings, with 634 rooms, of which 361 were used 
by the primary, 236 by the grammar, and 37 by the high schools. Of the '719 teachers, 
372 were in the primary department, 244 in the grammar, 32 in the high school, 4 were 
special teachers of French, 8 of German, 4 of music, 2 of drawing, 1 of book-keeping, 23 
were regular substitutes, and 29 were in the evening schools. In all the schools, 573 
pupils studied French and 1,990 German. The 3 evening schools enrolled 3,511, with 
an ayerage attendance of 880. Substitute teachers were employed for all the grades, 
including the evening schools. They take charge of classes when teachers are absent, 
fill vacancies, and instruct new classes until regular teachers are appointed. They are 
paid according to grade, from $6 to $2 a day while in school and $1.50 when not* 
needed. Four frame buildings were erected during the year. The total valuation of 
school property was $3,137,000. The schools were taught 205 days. Private and paro- 
chial schools enrolled 5,731.— (Return and city report. 
Stockton reports few figures in addition to those given in the table, but itis learned from 
a return made by the city superintendent that there was no change in the number of 
school buildings or rooms, that the schools were taught 210 days, that special teachers 
of music and penmanship were employed at good salaries, and that there was an average 
of 41 pupils to a teacher. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
CALIFORNIA STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, SAN sosi. 
This school was organized at San Francisco in 1862, but was removed to San José in 
1870, where a stately building was completed for it in 1872 and used till 1880, when it 
was lost by fire. For 1880-81 it received from the State $33,300, which was $77.50 per 
capita of the number of students for the year. The school employed 16 resident in- 
structors, enrolled 432 normal students (of whom 372 were females), and had 57 other 
students in preparatory studies, making a total attendance in the year of 489. A class  
-P-A-G-E-294
    16 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
of 34 received diplomas of graduation, from 95 to 98 per cent. of whom were teaching. 
Graduates holding diplomas of this school may, with others having State diplomas, 
receive county certificates without examination, at the diseretion of the county boards. 
The full course covers 3 years, the scholastic year being 40 weeks. The school has a 
library of 1,450 volumes, 150 of which are pedagogical, a chemical laboratory, apparatus, 
and a museum of natural history. Vocal music and drawing are taught, and there is a 
model school.— (Return and school laws. ) 
In March, 1880, the legislature appropriated $50,000 for a branch normal school at 
Los Angeles, of the opening of which no notice was received up to the close of 1881. 
NORMAL SCHOOL FOR KINDERGARTEN TRAINING. 
The California Kindergarten Training School for Normal Instruction, San Francisco, 
Miss Kate D. Smith Wiggins principal, for 1880-’81 reported 14 female normal students 
and 4 graduates, all the latter teaching. A tuition fee of $100 is charged for the course, 
which occupies 45 weeks. In addition to a model school, instruction was given in vocal 
music and drawing. Miss Emma Marwedel, at Oakland, the originator of the Kinder- 
garten movement on the Pacific Coast, also trained normal pupils in Kindergarten meth- 
ods.— (Returns. ) 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
‘The normal class in connection with the girls’ high school in San Francisco enrolled 
155 in 1880-81 and graduated 76. Graduates of this school receive diplomas and cer- 
tificates valid in the city, which are graded like those of the State Normal School. The 
Pacific Methodist College, at Santa Rosa, and the Hesperian College, at Woodland, had 
normal departments of special training for the profession of teaching.— (Catalogues. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Teachers’ institutes seem to have been held in nearly all the counties, but in the 
absence of official reports no statistics can be given. ‘ 
Ata recent convention of county superintendents at San Francise the subject of 
holding teachers’ institutes was fully discussed. As generally conducted in the State, 
it was admitted that they had not been of great service to that large class of teachers 
they were mainly designed to benefit. There seemed to have been no well defined idea 
among a large proportion of superintendents and teachers as to the function of the insti- 
tute in supplying the place of normal schools to such teachers as have not been able to 
attend them. It was hoped that some change in the law on this point-would be made. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Pacific School and Home Journal, San Francisco, continued in 1881, as a monthly 
journal, to give efficient aid to the educational interests of the Pacific Coast, not only by 
publishing educational intelligence, but also by discussing many questions connected 
with the improvement of the school systems. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The high school at Los Angeles had 3 optional courses of 4 years each, literary, scien- 
tific, and classical, with an attendance of 100. Oakland High School sustained its high 
rank, and is reported to have matriculated more students into the State University than 
any other on that coast. It enrolled 352 and graduated 55. The girls’ high school in 
San Francisco had 850 pupils; 602 were examined and 560 promoted. Many of the 
students of this school prepare for teaching. The boys’ school of this grade had a3 
years’ course in English and one of 4 years in classical studies. There was an enrolment 
of 825. Of the 179 examined 170 were promoted. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory schools, and 
preparatory departments of colleges or universities, see Tables IV, VI, VII,:and IX of . 
the appendix following, and the summaries thereof in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of California, Berkeley, crowning the educational system of the State, 
aims to complete the work begun in the public schools. To establish closer relations 
with these than formerly existed, it proposed in 1881 to adopt the Michigan plan of ad- 
mitting graduates of the public high schools without examination, on condition that a
-P-A-G-E-295
  
  CALIFORNIA, 17 
committee of the faculty, invited to visit such high schools, shall approve their courses 
of instruction, The university (outside of its professional schools) is organized in two 
departments of science and letters, comprising 8 colleges, with courses leading to degrees, 
and also certain irregular courses not leading to degrees. The college of letters main- 
tains 2 courses, one classical, leading to the degree of A. B.; another literary, leading to 
the degree of PH. B.; each requires a fall course of 4 years? study. The literary is sim- 
ilar to the classical course, except that modern languages take the place of Greek. In 
1881 the requirements for admission to the literary course were extended and further 
requirements were announced for 1882, 1883, and 1884. An elementary acquaintance 
with literature, with evidence of intelligent reading and study of good authors, will be 
accepted as an equivalent for advanced knowledge of technical grammar. In both the 
scientific and the literary colleges German, French,-:and Anglo-Saxon enter into the courses 
of the freshmen and sophomore classes, while in the junior classes they are elective. Pro- 
vision is also made for the optional study of Spanish, Hebrew, Chaldaic, and Syriac. The 
university library contained 16,000 volumes in 1881, valuable especially for reference, 
and was being constantly augmented from the Reese fund of $50,000. It was soon to be 
removed to the new Bacon Library and Art Building, which was meant to accommodate 
90,000 volumes. 
Besides:the university there were 12 schools claiming collegiate rank in 1880-’81, of 
which number 2 were termed universities (somewhat prospectively). Of those termed 
colleges, 1 Protestant Episcopal, 3 Roman Catholic, 2 Christian, and 1 non-sectarian 
appear from their own reports to be rather preparatory schools than real colleges. The 
remaining 5, viz, University of Southern California, Los Angeles; St. Ignatius College, 
San Francisco; Santa Clara College, Santa Clara; University of the Pacific, at the same 
place, and Pacific Methodist College, Santa Rosa, all presented collegiate courses of fair 
standard and of 4 years’ duration in their classical departments, with 3 or 4 years in the 
scientific. All the 12 offered instruction in music, vocal and instrumental, and 5 in 
drawing, to which 3 added painting. Most had business courses also, and 2—the Uni- 
versity of Southern California, Los Angeles, and Washington College, Washington— 
offered normal training. In all French and German were at least optional studies and 
in 8 Spanish was such; in the State university and one other college Hebrew and its cog- 
nate languages were optional. — (Catalogues and returns. ) 
For other information, including statistics, see Table IX of the appendix, and a sum- 
mary of it in the report ‘of the Commissioner preceding. 
     
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The 6 colleges above referred to as giving instruction to young women as well as to 
young men are the State University, Berkeley ; Pierce Christian College, College City ; 
University of the Pacific, Santa Clara; Pacific Methodist College, Santa Rosa ; Washing- 
ton College, Washington ; and Hesperian College, Woodland. 
For institutions especially for young women, see Table VIII of the appendix, and a sum- 
mary of its statistics in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Through its colleges of agriculture, mechanics, mining, engineering, and chemistry, the 
University of California initiates the student in the principles of modern science, giving 
in the first two years about the same instruction in all and in the third and fourth years « 
special attention to the studies in the college elected by the student. Students in special 
and partial courses in agriculture and chemistry are received on examination, and may at- 
tend such lectures and exercises as belong to their particular studies. In the college of 
mechanics industrial drawing is taught with special reference to the construction of ma- 
chinery. All the scientific courses lead to the degree of PH. B. In the college of mining 
a graduate course of two years leads to the degree of M. E. and a similar course in the col- 
lege of engineering to a degree of C. E. 
‘Scientific courses were reported i in all the colleges of the State and an additional Latin- 
scientific course of 3 years in the University of the Pacific. There was also an additional 
philosophical course of 4 years in the University of Southern California. There was 
reported a school of engineering in San Francisco, but with no details for 1880—81,— 
(Catalogues and returns. ) 
PROFESSIONAL. 
To give instruction in theology, the Pacific Theological Seminary, Oakland (Congre- 
gational), has a three years’ course and requires a collegiate course, or its equivalent, 
for admission. Of its 6 students during the year, 2 graduated. From a donation of 
$2,000 two scholarships of $1,000 each were established. San Francisco Theological Semi- 
2E
-P-A-G-E-296
18 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  nary (Presbyterian) received in 1880 an endowment fund of $50,000 from R. L. Stewart, 
of New York. Pierce Christian College, College City (Christian), gives, in its Bible de- 
partment, elementary instruction which may aid in preparation for the ministry. In 
the University of the Pacific, Santa Clara (Methodist Episcopal), in connection with the 
collegiate course, studies leading to the ministry are pursued. In 1879-80 steps were 
reported to have been taken toward the formation of a theological class, but no notice of 
such action appears in the catalogue of 1881.— (Catalogues and return.) 
For further information, see Table XI of the appendix. 
Legal instruction is given in the Hasting College of Law, connected with the State Uni- 
versity, Berkeley. The course requires 3 years. Applicants for admission to the junior 
class must have sufficient knowledge to enable them to profit by the course of study; and 
a satisfactory examination in the preceding studies is the condition of entering either of 
the other classes.— (University register, 1879-’80.) 
To provide medical instruction the Medical College of the Pacific and the medical de- 
partment of the University of California, ‘‘regular,’’ San Francisco, have had, since 1879, 
graded courses of 3 years, with lecture terms of 5 months each year. In the former, be- 
sides the required 20 weeks of attendance, there are 15 more optional. This school in 
1880-81 graduated 9; the other, 172.— (University Register, 1879-’80, and returns. ) 
The California Medical College, Oakland (eclectic), organized in 1879, offers a graded 
course of instruction of 3 terms, and requires a fair English education and attendance 
on 3 regular lecture courses of 6 months each (or 2 such and one of 13 weeks), with a 
course of dissection, a thesis, and the passage of a satisfactory examination. Of its 30 
students in 1880-81, 11 graduated. It admits both sexes on equal terms.— (Catalogue 
and return.) 
According to an official circular, the opening exercises of a woman’s medical college 
were held in San Francisco November, 1831, and its first session was to begin November 
16 and continue 20 weeks. No other official information respecting it has reached this 
Bureau. 
The Cogswell Dental College of the University of California, arranged for in 1879, in San 
Francisco, is to be opened to both sexes, when in full operation, and is to have 7 profess- 
orships. The exercises had not begun in 1880-’81.— (University register.) 
The California College of Pharmacy, San Francisco, although affiliated with the Uni- 
versity of California, retains its own organization. It requires the usual 4 years’ expe- 
rience in an apothecary store, attendance on 2 lecture courses of 5 months each, a thesis, 
and the passage of an examination, written, oral, and practical. The 2 years’ graded 
course projected for 1881 does not appear to have been established up to the summer of 
that year. The College reported 4 resident professors and lecturers, with 47 students in 
its last class.— (University register, 1880, and return.) 
For statistics of scientific and professional instruction, see Tables X, XI, XII, and XIII 
of the appendix; for summaries of them, like tables in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. £ 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
_ At the California Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Berkeley, instruc- 
tion is given in the common and high school branches and in gardening and farming. 
Articulation was taught. Founded in 1860, the institution has received 239 pupils, 
most of them remaining about 5 years. In 1881 there were 116 deaf and dumb pupils, 
under 12 instructors. 
In the department for the blind there were 30 pupils, who were instructed in vocal and 
instrumental music, bead and crochet work, as well as the common and high school 
studies, The whole institution was entirely supported by the State, ata cost of $40,000.— 
(State report, 1880, and return for 1881.) 
For further information, see Tables XVIII and XIX of the appendix. 
EDUCATION OF THE CHINESE. 
The Chinese are tauglit in evening and Sunday schools, in connection with the Christian 
missions. The Baptists had an evening school at Oakland; the Methodists, schools at San 
Francisco, San José, Oakland, and Sacramento; the Congregzationatists, at San Francisco, 
Oakland, Stockton, Petaluma, Santa Barbara, and Marysville; the Reform Church, one at 
Oakland; the United Presbyterian, at Los Angeles; and the Presbyterian, in San Francisco, 
San José, and Santa Rosa. As nearly the same elementary instruction is given in the 
evening and Sunday schools, statistics of both are given: enrolled in evening schools, 
2,700; in Sunday schools, 3,300; average attendance at evening schools, 825; at Sunday 
schools, 1,100.— (Reports, and letter from Sarah B. Cooper April 3, 1881.)

EDUCATION OF ORPHANED AND ABANDONED CHILDREN. 
There were 16 of these institutions in 1880 receiving aid from the State, containing 
521 orphans, 1,639 half-orphans, and 83 abandoned children, the State having paid dur- 
ing that year $146, 737. Among the duties of the State superintendent, he is required 
by ‘the school law ‘to visit the several orphan asylums to which State appropriations are 
made and examine into the course of instruction therein.’’? He reported that, ‘‘so far 
as it has yet been possible to discharge this duty, the results have been most satisfactory. 
The course of study has been found to embrace the branches usually taught in public 
and private schools. To these are added religious instruction and training in other prac- 
tical directions, as, on the part of girls, in plain and ornamental needlework, &e. In all 
cases the children have been found to be well housed and fed, and, in short, well cared 
for, physically, mentally, and morally.’”’— (State report, 1880.) 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The City and County Industrial School of San Francisco, under the care of the city au- 
thorities, organized in 1856, admits youth under 18 years of age, who, through neglect, 
are in danger of becoming criminals, and trains them in the elements of a common school 
education, in music, and in such industries as shoemaking, tailoring, laundry work, 
gardening, and farming; the girls are taught various kinds of machine needlework and 
domestic duties. There were 177 children received during the year ending in June, 1881. 
The educational department was well organized, and a high standard of scholarship and 
deportment was maintained. Many former inmates have become good citizens and are 
getting a living by the trades learned in this school.— (Report. ) 
TRAINING IN ART. 
‘Fhe San Francisco School of Design was organized in 1873, under the auspices of the 
San Francisco Art Association. Instruction is given in painting and drawing. No pupils 
under 14 years of age are admitted; those entering pay tuition feés, and any deficiency is 
made up by the association. For statistics, see Table XXIII of the appendix. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The State Teachers’ Association held its fifteenth annual meeting at San Francisco 
December 27, 1881, Ex-Superintendent James Denman presiding. After an address of 
welcome by J.8.0. Stubbs, president of the board of education of San Francisco, President 
Denman read an address on ‘‘Graded schools and their defects,’ and Selden Sturgis, of 
San Francisco, one on “‘ The uses and abuses of the credit system, ”’ which led to consid- 
erable discussion. Wednesday, Rev. A. L. Cole, D. D., of Dixon, dwelt on the need of 
religious instruction in the public schools, the discussion of which developed general op- 
position to hisviews. State Superintendent F. M. Campbell then addressed the conven- 
tion on ‘‘Education as the true liberty.’’ Jesse Wood, superintendent of Butte County, 
presented the subject of ‘‘County superintendents’’ and their duties under the new 
constitution. President W. T. Reed, of the State University, exposed the ‘‘ Current 
fallacies in education,’’ one of which was that a pupil shall not follow the language 
of the text book. ‘ Professor White, of the boys’ high school, explained the working of 
the credit system in that institution. He believed initand had notrouble. The follow- 
ing was unanimously adopted: 
“ Resolved, That this association views with disfavor any attempt to disturb the strict 
neutrality of the public school system upon questions of religious faith.”’ 
On Thursday, Superintendent J. M. Guinn, of Los Angeles, read a paper on ‘‘ Mechan- 
ical pedagogy;’’ Dr. J. H. Wythe, one on ‘‘Symmetrical education;’’ and President Charles 
H. Allen, of the State Normal School, San José, one on the ‘‘ Necessity of trained teachers. ’’ 
The meeting was one of great interest, there being present teachers, who came from 
nearly every county in the State.— (Pacific Journal, February, 1882.) 
SUPERINTENDENTS’ MEETING. 
One of the most important features of the meeting of the State Teachers’ Association 
-was the convention of the county superintendents. About forty of the fifty-two counties 
in the State were represented, State Superintendent Campbell presiding. A large amount 
of work was done. The school law was taken up, article by article, and various amend- 
ments were discussed, and committees appointed on each important division. These com- 
mittees, after much deliberation, reported changes and new sections, which were dis- 
cussed by the full convention and final action taken. 
The action of this body in regard to teachers’ institutes is reported under that heading.

STATE: SCHOOL SYSTEM, 
OFFICERS. 
These are a State board of education for general supervision of the public schools, with 
a State superintendent of public instruction as president and executive officer, county 
superintendents of schools, boards of 3 to 6 directors for school districts (to be voted 
for by women, they being also eligible), and high school committees of 3 members, with 
the county superintendent as a member and president ex officio, for union high schools, 
formed by the joint action of contiguous districts. All these except the high school com- 
mittees are provided for by the constitution as well as by the school law. “Other consti- 
tutional officers, less directly connected with the system, area board of 6 regents of the State 
University and a board of 4 commissioners of public (including school) ‘Tands.— (Consti- 
tution of 1876 and school laws of 1877 and 1879.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The schools of the State are for the free instruction of all youth 6-21 in the districts 
where they are held. Non-residents and adults may be admitted on terms prescribed 
by the school board. They are sustained from the proceeds of a small State school fund 
and of a county school tax of 2 to 5 mills on $1, both distributed on the basis of the youth 
6-21 in each district. To aid in lengthening the annual term and to improve the 
buildings and advantages, additional district taxes may be levied. For districts to receive . 
their share of State and county school funds schools must be taught at least 3 school 
months of 20 days under duly licensed teachers. High schools and school district libra- 
ries, to be open to the public, are provided for in districts with more than 350 youth of 
school age. Sectarian instruction in the State schools, as well as distinction or classifica- 
tion of pupils by race or color, is forbidden. Instruction in them must be in English, 
though German and Spanish, or either, with gymnastics, may be taught when the parents 
or guardians of 20 or more pupils demand it or the school board deem it expedient. Other 
branches of learning are left to their discretion, as are the exercises in the schools, the 
selection of the text books, and the determination of the character and length of course. 
Teachers must make the reports as to school term, pupils, &c., required by law before re- 
ceiving their pay.— (School laws, edition of 1881.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
No printed report for 1880-’81 having been received, the statistics supplied by the State 
superintendent form the only guide to the educational condition of the year. ‘These indi- 
cate a most encouraging advance, 5,238 more youth of school age, 3,881 more of this age 
in the State schools, 2,031 more in average attendance daily, and this in 22 more school- 
houses, with 5,977 more sittings, under 112 more regular teachers. Teachers for the 
most part received better pay. The advance in receipts for schools reached $185,935, the 
expenditures for them being also $161,624 greater. School property, through the rap- 
idly improving condition of the State and through the better quality of new buildings for 
the schools, was rated $294,803 higher. 
KINDERGARTEN. | ° 
For any of these means of elementary instruction that may report for 1881, see Table V 
of the appendix. 
®@ CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
A general law gives to school districts with more than 1,000 youth of school age boards 
of 6 directors, chosen by the people, one-third of the board being liable to change each 
year. Denver and Leadville have boards in conformity with the provisions of this gen- 
eral law, each board appointing a superintendent of its schools. Golden, under a law for 
districts of smaller school population, has a board of three members, one liable to change 
each year.

22 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
In Denver the advanced position of former years was maintained and extended. Three 
new school buildings were completed and occupied, giving, with former ones, 2,460 seats, 
which, by alternating the lower grades, were made to accommodate the 2,730 pupils in 
average attendance. Two more buildings which were in progress were expected to be 
ready for use by Christmas, 1881, bringing the seating capacity up to 3,000. Each pupil 
in all these buildings was to have 27 square feet of floor space and 460 cubic feet of air 
space, with ample ventilation. One of the two to be completed in December was in- 
tended for the high school and a free public library. In all classes of the public schools 
beyond the third grade the study of German was permitted, 13 of the regular teachers 
giving instruction in it, with occasional aid and supervision from a special German teacher. 
From 260 to 360 pupils were thus instructed in German during the year. In reading 
English, a book supplementary to the First Reader was used with advantage one day in 
each week in the first and second grades. As a rule, passage from grade to grade was 
regulated partly by the record of the average daily scholarship and partly by the results 
of the semiannual examinations. For the high school, see Secondary Instruction, further 
on.— (Report and return.) 
Golden appears to have been still improving its school system, levying for it a tax of 
103 mills, expending on it $18,657 for the year, and maintaining the grades adopted, with 
good attendance and good discipline. For the fall term there were 562 pupils enrolled and 
410 in average attendance, and for the winter term 541 enrolled and 402 in average attend- 
ance, with 83 maintaining during the year a standing of 95 per cent. or more in scholar- 
ship and deportment.— (Report. ) 
Leadville in its 5 school buildings (rated at $113,550, with sites, furniture, and appa- 
ratus) had 1,400 sittings for study, fairly accommodating the average enrolment and going 
beyond the average daily attendance. A special teacher of music wasemployed. Lead- 
villegave its superintendent $2,000, its high school principal $810, its other teachers $720. 
(Return. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The University of Colorado, at Boulder, and Colorado College, Colorado Springs, both 
present definite normal courses, the former of 3 years, the latter of 4, each requiring for 
admission evidence of acquaintance with elementary English studies. The University 
of Denver also provides training in such studies as may prepare teachers for their work. 
How far it gives instruction in the science and art of teaching does- not appear, though 
this has from the first been attended to at Colorado College and is promised at the Uni- 
versity of Colorado in 1882. The high schools of Denver and Leadville afford the means 
of special training for school work in those cities. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
As was stated in the report for 1880, the law providing for the instruction of teachers 
by means of specially called institutes in each judicial district has thus far proved inop- 
erative from the grea’ extent of territory in each district and the consequent difficulty 
of assembling at any central point enough teachers to make an institute successful. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION® 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS.   Denver and Leadville both carry their instruction up into fair high school studies, the 
former ‘having 3 courses, each of 4 years, one chiefly English, another English and 
Latin, and a third including Greek also, French being ‘optional i in the last 2 years of any 
course, The Denver school closed its sixth year in 1881, having then representatives at 
West Point, Yale, and Wellesley, the one at West Point said to be leading his class in 
scholarship. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
From the reports of institutions to this Bureau and from the year books of different 
churches and associations, there appear to be in Colorado at least 5 church schools of 
academic rank: 2 of them, Jarvis Hall, for boys, and Wolfe Hall, for girls (Protestant 
Episcopal), both at Denver; 1, St. Mary? 's Convent Academy, for girls (Roman Catholic), 
also at Denver; and 2, Leadville Academy and Trinidad Academy, under Congregational 
influence, and helieved to be in each case open to both sexes. Jour other schools under 
Roman Catholic government, all styled academies, existed in 1881 in different parts of 
the State, the rank of which for that year has not yet been determined. Golden Acad- 
emy, Golden (Protestant Episcopal), isnot reported for 1881, having probably been merged 
in Jarvis Hall, out of which it originally sprang.

For the statistics of business colleges, private or church academic schools, preparatory 
schools, and preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, IX, and X of 
the appendix; for summaries of their statistics, see corresponding tables in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Colorado, Boulder, chartered in 1875 and organized for work in 1877, 
formed in 1879-~’80 its first collegiate class of 8, half being young women. The class that 
followed this consisted of 7 young men and 3 young women, the classes of 1882 and 1883, 
of 19 and 35, respectively, each including both sexes.! Its course, as far as given, appears 
to be well up with the requirements of the day, covering 3 years of preparatory and 4 of 
collegiate study, divided into classical and scientific, with special courses of indefinite 
duration that do not lead to a diploma. A normal course of 2 years is also offered. 
Colorado. College, Colorado Springs (under liberal Congregational influences), and the 
University of Denver? (Methodist Episcopal) both present full and good preparatory 
courses of 4 years, with classical collegiate of the same length; both admit young women 
to full privileges, and both give normal instruction to such students as desire to teach, 
the latter adding also training in music and art and offering training especially prepara- 
tory to business. For what they offer in practical sciences, see Scientific Instruction, 
further on. 
For statistics of 1880-’81, as far as they may be given, see Table IX of appendix; 
for a summary of such statistics, a corresponding table in report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
  INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
As before stated, the University of Colorado, University of Denver, and Colorado Col- 
lege all open their doors to young women as well as to young men ; but, as far as can be 
ascertained, no institution of full collegiate rank especially or exclusively for them had 
been established in 1881. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State University, the two other collegiate institutions previously mentioned, with 
the State Agricultural College,® Fort Collins, and the State School of Mines,* Golden, 
all afford opportunities for scientific training useful to the agricultural, engineering, and 
mining industries of the State. In the State University, the State Agricultural College, 
and the University of Denver the courses cover 4 collegiate years beyond the prepara- 
tory; in the State School of Mines and the regular scientific course of Colorado College, 
3 years. This last offers also special courses, of less definite duration, in mining engineer- 
ing and metallurgy.— (Calendars and circulars. ) 
For such statistics of scientific classes as these institutions may report, see Tables IX 
and X of the appendix; for summaries of these statistics, see corresponding tables in the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
7 PROFESSIONAL. . 
Theological instruction, under Protestant Episcopal influences, was given in 1880-’81 
in the Cathedral Theological School, Denver, by 4 instructors, to apparently a single stu- 
dent. This school is the successor of Matthews Hall, Golden, which, after 6 years’ ser- 
yice, was suspended in 1877, and lost its buildings and library by fire April 6, 1878.— 
(Protestant Episcopal ‘Almanac. ) 
Vedical instruction, appaently after the ‘‘regular’”’ system, was offered in the autumn   
1A subsequent catalogue shows that the young women, with a single exception, had dropped out of, the collegiate classes by the close of 1881. 
2 This university is the outgrowth of a school that was chartered in 1864 as the Colorado Seminary, under Methodist Episcopal influences ; it continued for some years, but eventually failed from lack of funds. It began its new life as the Deny er University and Colorado Seminary in 1880, but in 1881 
dropped the latter part of its title, the seminary having been made a preparatory department of the university.— (Catalogues and return.) 
3 The State Agricultural College, réceiving 90,000 acres of land as an endowment from the con- gressional land grant for such colleges, was first chartered in 1877 and organized in 1879, ina new 
building erected for it in 1878, where, on a farm of 240 acres, it has since heen steadily increasing its Spaces advantages. During the winter of 1879~'80 it held 7 farmers’ institutes in different parts 
of the State. 
4'The State School of Mines, chartered in 1872 and organized for work in 1873, was made a State school by act of February 9, 1874, Reorganized and recquipped in 187980, it entered a new build- ing, with greatly augmented apparatus for its work, October 13, 1880. 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  24 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  of 1881 by the College of Medicine of the University of Denver, which seems to have 
been then just organized, with 17 instructors. The requirements for admission are an ex- 
amination in English composition, writing, grammar, arithmetic, natural philosophy, and 
the rudiments of Latin and Greek, except for high school graduates or others certified 
by their instructors in such a school to be proficient in these studies; for graduation, 
study under a physician for three years, attendance on at least 2 full co of lectures 
(which in this school are of 26 weeks), with a thesis and the passage of a actory exam- 
ination in the 7 principal branches of medical science. The full curriculum embraces 3 
consecutive graded courses of lectures; but, while this is earnestly recommended, it was 
not made obligatory in 1881~’82, nor was any inducement offered to complete it, beyond 
a reduction of one-half in the fees for the third year.— (Calendar of university.) 
    SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND THE BLIND. 
The Colorado Mute and Blind Institute, Colorado Springs, is a State school, begun in 
1874, with acourse of instruction meant to cover 7 years; it had 40 pupils in 1881, out of 
54 entered from the beginning of its work. These, all deaf-mutes (accommodations for 
the blind not being then complete), were instructed in the ordinary school studies, with 
drawing, articulation, and lip reading, asalsoinsuch industtiesas printing forthe boys, and 
sewing, dressmaking, household work, care of younger children, &c., for the girls. Pyo- 
vision for the accommodation of the blind appears to have been in progress, and it was 
hoped that after the opening of-the new building other useful employments might be in- 
troduced. Instructors in school studies, 3; in household industries, 1. 
INSTRUCTION IN ART. 
The University of Denver presents courses of instruction in music and painting: the 
former includes vocal and instrumental training that covers 4 years and leads to the de- 
gree of MUS. B.; the latter extends through 14 stages, the time required for which and 
for the degree of bachelor of painting is to depend on the ability and application of the 
student. Both courses, as detailed, appear to be more thorough and comprehensive than 
is common in the colleges.— (Catalogue and circular.) 
NOTEWORTHY BENEFACTIONS. 
GIFTS FOR EDUCATION. 
The prospectus of the University of Denver in 1880 stated that, when Colorado Scmi- 
nary, out of which the university has grown, failed some years ago from want of funds, 
Ex-Governor Evans, one of the earliest and most earnest friends of the seminary, bought 
the property, paid the debt, and at the date of the circular proposed to give the ground 
and buildings to the trustees of the university and to add $3,000 to purchase apparatus, 
while another zealous friend, Mr. J. W. Bailey, offered $10,000 more. No explicit no- 
tice of the accomplishment of these benevolent propositions appears in the catalogue or 
return for 1881; but, as the buildings have evidently come into possession of the trustees 
improved and much enlarged, it is taken for granted that these gentlemen have carried 
out their kind intentions. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
COLORADO STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The meeting of this body for 1881 was appointed for December 28-30, at. Colorado 
Springs, and is said to have had an inspiriting programme prepared for it; but no account 
of its proceedings has been received.

  26 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. — 
OFFICERS. 
The general control of educational interests is confided to a State board of education 
composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and 4 persons appointed by the general 
assembly, one from each congressional district, who hold office 4 years, 1 being changed each 
year. The board appoints a secretary, who is its executive officer and acts as superin- 
tendent of schools, and a general agent to supervise the execution of the compulsory 
school laws. There is also an assistant secretary for office work. Town'school officers 
are boards of visitors of 3, 6, or 9 members, or else school committees of 6, 9, or 12, the 
latter in towns which have abolished the district system. District officers are school 
committees of 3 members, except in school districts which succeeded former school 
societies, where there are, instead, boards of education of 6 or 9 members. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
School funds are derived from local taxation, from the income of a State school fund 
and town deposit fund, and from a State appropriation of $1.50 for-each child 4-16, 
which age is the'basis of apportionment of public school moneys to towns. No district 
may receive its share of State school funds unless it has provided school accommodations 
satisfactory to the town board of visitors, has made through its committee an annual 
report to the town board, and sustained school at least 30"veeks during the year if there 
are 24 or more children 4-16 years old in the district, and 24 weeks if the number be 
Jess. Towns neglecting to provide for the support of schools forfeit to the State a sum 
equal to the amount which they were by law required to appropriate. School visitors must 
report annually to the/secretary of the State board and the latter to the general assem- 
bly. In order to receive pay from public funds teachers must hold a certificate of quali- 
fication from school visitors, keep a register, and report to school visitors. Provision is 
made for public school libraries, graded and high schools, a normal school, a reform 
school, and an industrial school for girls. All children 8-14, unless physically or mentally 
disabled, must attend some school at least 3 months in each year, of which 6 weeks must 
be consecutiv e, or else be taught the common school branches at home for an equal length 
of time; and’ such children may not be employed in any business unless they have been 
taught for at least 60 days during the year preceding. 
  NEW LEGISLATION. 
Among the amendments to school laws passed during the January session, 1881, was one 
giving the city council of any city power to establish and maintain a public library and 
reading room and to levy a tax for such purpose not to exceed one mill and a half on 
the dollar annually. 
The same privilege was extended to any town or borough in which, on the petition of 
50 legal voters, a majority of the voters should decide in favor of the imposition of a tax 
‘within the 3 mill limit for this purpose.— (State report. ) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show a slight increase during 1880—’81 in the number of public schools 
taught, in the departments or rooms in them, in the length of school term, and in the 
number of teachers and their pay. But the number of pupils receiving instruction not 
only did not keep pace with the increase in school population, but actually fell off by 
313 in public schools and 1,400 in private. It is thought that the attendance on private 
schools was greater than the number given, for, although school visitors are required to 
report on this point, the law gives them no authority to obtain the necessary information 
except as it may be given voluntarily. The decrease in public school enrolment, it is 
said, will not justify the inference that education was considered less important than 
heretofore; but, on the contrary, it is more clearly seen each year that a State whose 
prosperity depends so largely as does this on skilled labor cannot afford to allow any por- 
tion of its youth to be unschooled. It is explained that during 1880-’81 more children 
under 5 were excluded from public school than ever before, and that an increased pros- 
perity in business caused the withdrawal of more youth 14-16 for work. It is thought that 
the number notin any school was almost entirely made up of the latter class and of children 
under 6 (the enumeration taking in all 4-16), and that almost all the children 8-14 were 
in school during some portion of the year. The expenditure for public schools increased 
by $68,316 and the income by $324, though the amount raised by local tax and volun- 
tary contributions was $14,539 less. The compulsory school law had continued to be 
useful in preventing truancy and absenteeism. The agent of the board yisited about 200 
schools in 44 towns, causing the prosecution of 6 parents and 1 guardian for neglecting 
to send their children to school. During the ten years past, 17 parents and guardians 
have been prosecuted for such neglect. Most of these paid the fine and costs; but in some 
cases judgment was suspended. while the children attended school for at least 3 months, 
and then the complaints were withdrawn. \

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Bridgeport, besides 5,191 pupils attending public schools, reports 450 in private schools, 
making 5,641 under instruction and leaving 1,634 not attending any school. There was. 
an increase of 77 in public school enrolment and a slight decrease in average attendance. 
Of the 90 teachers, 81 had been continuously employed and 9 were beginners; 87 were 
women, who received an average monthly pay of $44.95. The three men were paid. 
$146.67 each. A new and commodious high school building was erected in a central and 
otherwise desirable locality of the city. It is of 3 stories, contains 14 study and recita- 
tion rooms, also 6 others, includitig a chemical laboratory and library. All the modern 
conveniences and improvements have been introduced, the most approved methods of 
heating, lighting, and ventilation being adopted. 
In Danbury the public school enrolment and average attendance decreased slightly 
during 1880-’81. There were 116 pupils attending private schools and 436 not under in- 
struction. Of the 47 teachers all but 4 had been continuously employed; all but 6 were 
women, who received an average of $37.74 a month, men being paid $63.50. e 
Derby reports 36 children in private schools and 387 not under instruction. Of the 
teachers 6 were men and 42 women; 46 had been continuously employed, the men being: 
paid an average of $85.42 monthly, the women $41.06. 
Greenwich had a lower public school enrolment by 71, with 64 fewer in average attend- 
ance, than during 1879-80; private schools enrolled 145, leaving 339 not attending any 
school. Of the 29 teachers only 2 were beginners. Men were paid an average of $48.89: | 
monthly; women, $32.19. Schools were generally prosperous. Steps were being taken 
in a portion of the district to secure a much needed addition to the accommodations for 
upils. 
H Hartford reports a slight decrease during the year in public school enrolment and 
average attendance, 1,487 pupils in private schools, and 1,093 children out of school. Of 
the public school teachers (20 men and 122 women), all had been continuously employed, 
the men receiving $195.92 monthly, the women $60.05. There was a full.attendance on 
evening schools of students 8 to 50 years of age, who earnestly endeavored to improve. 
The endeavor to keep truancy within bounds was reasonably successful. Twenty truants- 
were committed to reformatory institutions, against 15 the year before. The high 
school was efficient, as,in former years. It has become an educational necessity which 
the people would not e without for many times its cost. Subsequent information in- 
dicates that the beautiful building it occupied has been destroyed by fire. 
The Meriden public schools during 1880-’81 gained 106 in number of pupils enrolled 
and lost 4in average attendance. There were 655 attending private schools and 845 
supposed to be in no school. Of the teachers only 2 were beginners in the work; 8 were: 
men and 40 women, the men being paid $104.38, the women $44.88 monthly. A cen- 
tral school for the more advanced pupils was established to meet a need which has ex- 
isted for some time, and which had been partially supplied by teaching some of the 
higher branches in the graded schools. Drawing, which had been neglected of late, was. 
to receive special attention.

    28 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Middletown had 17 more pupils enrolled in public schools in 1880-81 than the year be- 
fore, but owing to the prevalence of diseases the average attendance was less by 213. 
There were 494 attending private schools, and 301 were supposed to be without instruc- 
tion. All the teachers had been continuously employed. Men received an average of 
$91.63, women of $38.85 a month. A great improvement in discipline is reported, and | | 
this improvement was ascribed to the fact that corporal punishment had been discour- 
aged and almost abolished. From January to July there were only 16 cases of flogging, . 
against 187 the year before. 
In New Britain the enrolment and average attendance in public schools were consider- 
ably less than the year before; more pupils attended parochial schools, and the public 
schools sufiered also from absences caused by vaccination. The attendance in private 
and parochial schools was 817, and 720 were reported tobe in noschool. Of the 35 teachers 
2 were men; ‘all had been continuously employed, the men at $148.95. month, the women 
at $38.63. A class of 6 was graduated from the high school. Botany was added to the 
course of study there. 
New Haven had 756 more pupils attending public schools during 1880~’81 than the year 
before and 706 more in average daily attendance. Private schools enrolled 1,586 chil- 
dren and 1,616 were in no school. Of the teachers in public schools —17 men and 220 
women — 225 were continuously employed. Men were paid an average for the month of 
$179.53; women, $51.02. Gratifying progress was made in the primary department. 
‘The experiment of teaching children to read and write script at the very beginning of 
their course was successful and had been largely extended. Teachers say that script is 
learned quite as easily as print and that much time is saved by beginning thus early. 
The high school course has been upward, with little serious interruption, during a num- 
ber of years. There were 580 pupils enrolled in the high school, of whom 331 were in 
average daily attendance. In 1881, for the first time since the graduating class became 
large, all who desired to teach were admitted to the training school. 
New London reports a decrease of 176 in-public school enrolment and of 56 in average 
attendance, 40 pupils in private schools, and 242 not in any. The 41 public school 
teachers—3 men and 38 women— had been continuously employed, men being paid an 
average of $186.67 a month and women $38.95. 
Norwalk also reports a loss in public school enrolment and average attendance; 465 
attended private schools and 330 no school. All the teachers in public schools had been 
continuously employed, men receiving an average of $76.75; women, $43.11. 
~ In Norwich public school enrolment decreased by 81 and average attendance by 34; 
385 pupils were reported in private schools and 503 in no school. Of 97 public school 
teachers, 90 had been continuously employed, the average monthly pay of men being 
$90.04; of women, $38.74. 
‘Stamford reports aslight increase in public school enrolment and average attendance, 
566 pupils in private schools, and 451 inno school. Of 35 publicschool teachers—7 men 
id 28 women— 32 had been continuously employed, men receiving an average of $88.57 
and women $41.74. 
Waterbury enrolled 144 more in public schools and had 183 more in average daily at- 
tendance. Of 57 teachers—5 men and 52 women—51 had been continuously employed. 
‘The private school attendance of 489 raises the total to 4,139; 520 were reported as not at- 
tending any school. 
In Windham there were 1,158 pupils enrolled in public schools, 679 in average attend- 
ance, 481 attending private schools, and 410 in no school. Of the 28 public school 
teachers, 21 had been continuously employed, men receiving an average of $69.33 a 
month; women, $32.10.   
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The State Normal School, New Britain, admits pupils who are at least 16 years old 
who pass an examination in the common school branches and declare their intention to 
teach in the public schools, giving free tuition in a 2 years’ course and also furnishing 
text books without charge. There were 150 pupils registered during the year and 115 
in average attendance, as large a number as can well be accommodated. Two classes 
were graduated, one of 20 in January and of 25 in June, nearly all of them engagingin 
teaching. But the number of students graduated does not repreSent the entire influence 
of the institution on the public schools; a considerable number of the normal pupils 
- enter the profession before completing the course, but not without receiving valuable 
instruction, suggestions, and inspirations, and acquiring more or less familiarity with 
improved methods. A liberal appropriation was made by the legislative assembly for 
a suitable normal school building to be erected immediately. 
TRAINING CLASSES AND DEPARTMENTS. 
Connected with the public high schools ina number of the more important cities are 
classes or departments for the preparation of teachers.

TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The institutes of 1880-’81 were largely attended by teachers, school officers, and citi- 
zens. A total of 896 attended the 4 institutes held; the sessions of each lasted 3 days, 
with an average of 224 attending, or 18 more than in any former year. The lecturers 
employed were practical teachers, who described methods they had themselves tested. 
Besides the institutes, and in connection with them, educational meetings were held in 
-many of the towns by the secretary of the board, for the purpose of enlisting the interest 
of teachers and citizens in education. A greater number of these local meetings was held 
this year than usual; they were cordially welcomed by the people and largely attended. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In this State all towns are authorized by law, but none are required, to establish and 
maintain schools of a higher grade than the ordinary publicschools. Those in operation 
comprise town and district high schools, senior departments of graded schools, and en- 
dowed academies conducted so as to form a part of the public school system. For this 
reason, says the State report, it is difficult to decide as to what may properly be called 
public high schools. A list is given, however, of 51 which have claims to be included, 
but no statistics are presented. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS.! 
For statistics of business colleges, private academies, and preparatory schools reporting, 
see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and summaries of these in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 1 : 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Yale College, New Haven (Congregational), Trinity College, Hartford (Protestant 
Episcopal), and Wesleyan University, Middletown (Methodist Episcopal), are the insti- 
tutions for superior instruction in Connecticut. The youngest of these (Wesleyan) has 
been in existence half a century, Trinity 55 years, and Yale 180 years. The two oldest 
are exclusively for young men; Wesleyan University has since 1872 admitted women on 
equal terms. 
Yale College offers instruction in departments of theology, medicine, law, and philoso- 
phy and the arts. The last comprises, besides an undergraduate academical department, 
courses for graduate instruction, the undergraduate section of the Sheffield Scientific 
School, and a school of the fine arts. The academical undergraduate course for the first 
two years is prescribed, while the junior and senior classes are allowed a large number 
of optionals. This department never knew a more prosperous year than that of 1880-’81. 
Scholarship was well maintained and the number of students and of instructors was never 
before so large. It was decided, to allow candidates for admission an examination in the 
more elementary studies a year or more in advance of the final one; also, that an exam- 
ining committee be sent hereafter to San Francisco, such committees having been hitherto 
sent only to Chicago and Cincinnati. Bequests were made to the institution during 
the year by various friends amounting to more than $350,000. Of thissum $10,000 were 
given by Lucius Hotchkiss, of New Haven, to the fund in aid of needy students of the 
academical department. Dr. Timothy Dwight Porter, who died in December, 1880, left, 
in addition to former gifts, property worth $43,000, which, less an annuity of $5,000, was 
to be used to increase the teaching force in the academical department. A laboratory 
for instruction in physics was pledged by two graduates, one of the most opportune gifts, 
it is said, that could have been made. All the arrangements for sewerage and drainage 
on the college campus were reconstructed during the year, at considerable expense and 
under direction of one of the most thorough sanitary engineers of the country, although 
no complaint had been made of the old plan and the health of students had been excep- 
tionally good. There were 50 students in the school of the fine arts, and 601 undergrad- 
uate and 44 graduate students: 
Trinity College offers the regular classical course, and also special studies, including 
modern languages and general science, the degrees being A. B. and B. s. Students de- 
siring to study without reference to a degree are admitted to such classes as they are 
prepared to enter. The college received a gift of $40,000 during the year from Col. C. H. 
Northam, of Hartford, for the erection of a building. _ The college had 101 students un- 
der 12 professors in 1881.

30 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Wesleyan University provides 3 undergraduate courses of study, classical, Latin-scientific, 
and scientific; 163 students attended in 1881. In the first two, many studies of the last3 
years are elective, but in the scientific course electives are permitted only in the last 2 
years. Opportunities for graduate study in any of the branches taughtare offered. Ex- 
aminations for admission were to be held in 1881 in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Cincinnati, 
and Chicago. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Sheffield Scientific School of Yale reports for the year 1880-’81 a decided increase 
in the number of students. Whether this was due to accidental causes or to the revival - 
of interest in those studies which bear directly upon the progress and prosperity of the 
country was doubtful. This school was organized in 1847, through the generosity of Mr. 
Joseph E. Sheffield, and received in 1863 the State’s share of the congressional appropria- 
tion for the benefit of industrial education. Three -undergraduate courses of study are 
provided, embracing, among other branches, instruction in chemistry, civil and dynamical 
engineering, and agriculture. There are also a numberof graduate courses arranged to 
suit the wants of college graduates and other persons of liberal education. In 1881 there 
were 185 students attending the school. 
  PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction is given in the theological department of Yale College (Congre- 
gational), in the Berkeley Divinity School, Middletown (Protestant Episcopal), and in the 
Theological Institute of Connecticut, at Hartford (Congregational). All present courses 
of study covering 3 years and require an examination for admission which must show a 
collegiate or equivalent training. Of 38 undergraduate students in the Berkeley Divinity 
School 36 held degrees in letters or science, and of 29 in the Hartford School 24 held such 
degrees. Out of 97 theological students in the school at Yale 84 had already taken one 
or more degrees and the others had attended colleges or seminaries without graduating. 
Provision is made at Yale and at the Hartford Seminary for graduate study. At Yale 7of 
the 97 students in 1880-81 were in a graduate class. The school at Hartford reports 1 
graduate student. A new library building has been erected for the theological library at 
Yale, at a cost of $10,000, being a donation from a former benefactor. 
Legal instruction is given in the law department of Yale College, which offers an under- 
graduate and a graduate course, each of 2 years. An examination for admission to the un- 
dergraduate department is required of all who are not college graduates. «The proportion 
of students who have had a collegiate training has continued to increase in the school, and 
during 1880-81 such students comprised two-thirds of the junior class. The graduate 
course, open to graduates from any law school, has created at Yale a school of political 
science, in which, among other topics, instrtiction is given in American and English con- 
stitutional history, the formation and regulation of municipal corporations, international 
Jaw, political economy, parliamentary law, canon law, general and comparative juris- 
prudence, Roman and French law, sociology, and the conffict of laws. A fund of $60,000 
(subject to a life interest) was bequeathed by Hon. Lafayette S. Foster, who died in 
September, 1880, to found a professorship of English common Jaw. This is the first legacy 
ever left to the school, and the chair for which it makes provision is the only one yet 
endowed. 
The medical department of Yale College reports,more effective work done during 
1880-’81 than in the years preceding, the factors in this improvement being an increase 
in the amount of the instruction given, a further development of the plan of study, and 
amaterial permanent improvements, such as apparatus, instruments, and laboratory and. 
lecture room conveniences. The work of instruction is represented by 1,389 hours, 
against 1,274 the year before, including only the hours spent in actual lectures, recita- 
tions, and laboratory teaching. During this, the second year of the graded system, the 
gradation has been much more complete than it was in the first: chemistry and normal 
histology were assigned to the first year, physiology to the last half of the junior and 
the first half of the middle year, and certain special courses to the senior year. Exam- 
inations are held at the end of each year in the branches studied. The library received, 
among other donations, a valuable one from the late Prof. David P. Smith, who be- 
queathed to it his valuable professional library and surgical instruments. He also left 
to the school a portion of his estate to be applied (at the death of his widow) to the en- 
dowment of a chair of the theory and practice of medicine. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The American Asylum for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Hartford, has given in- 
struction to 2,282 deaf and dumb youth of Connecticut and the other New England

States since its organization in 1816. During the year 1880—’81 225 pupils were regis- 
tered, and at date of the report 179 were attending, only 49 of these being from Con- 
necticut; 30 were from Maine, 17 from New Hampshire, 16 from Vermont, 61 from 
Massachusetts, and 6 from Rhode Island. Besides the common school branches, tailor- 
ing, cabinet making, and shoemaking are taught. Of 10 boys who graduated from the 
first class in June, 1880, 8 secured steady employment at good pay and 2 entere@ the 
National Deaf-Mute College at Washington. The plan of instruction pursued here is the 
combined method, embracing articulation, the sign language, and writing. It is believed 
that by articulation alone instructiou can be conveyed only to the semi-deaf and to ex- 
ceptionally bright pupils among the congenitally deaf, but that a large proportion of the 
latter never attain facility in lip reading and can be better taught by other means. 
Whipple Home School, Mystic River, a private school for deaf-mutes established in 1869, 
had 11 deaf and dumb under instruction during 1880-81. The plan followed is that of 
articulation exclusively. All are taught the common, school branches; the boys learn 
also to work on the farm and the girls to do housework. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
Connecticut has no institution for the blind, but provides for their instruction in the 
schools of other States. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Connecticut School for Imbeciles, Lakeville, gives instruction to this class of 
children in the more elementary common school branches, in Kindergarten work, sewing, 
fancy work, singing, dancing, and gymnastics, the aim being to extend a healthy train- 
ing to the physical as well as the mental powers. About 35 per cent. of pupils since the 
beginning have been improved by the course. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Connecticut State Reform School, Meriden, receives boys committed to it by the 
courts for crime or truancy, and also others placed here by parents or guardians for refor- 
mation. The mild yet firm discipline and parental care given the boys are producing 
good results, as shown by their improved character and conduct. There have been 3,076 
under instruction since the organization of the school in 1854; the number present Novem- 
ber, 1880, was 307. The schools are thoroughly classified in 7 grades, and liberally sup- 
plied with approved books and other necessities. Besides their literary studies, the boys 
are taught farming, the cane seating of chairs, and the manufacture of overalls. They 
are furnished with an abundance of wholesome food, are comfortably and neatly clad, 
and are lodged in single beds in light, well ventilated rooms. Bathing conveniences aré 
very complete, and untiring attention is given to cleanliness. 
The Connecticut Industrial School for Girls, Middletown, is not strictly a State institution, 
though fostered and encouraged by the State, buta private charity in its initiationand man- 
agement, and designed to save, educate, and prepare for useful life girls that are in danger 
of falling into vice and crime. To this end ,it gathers them into homes containing, as a 
tule, not more than 35 each, with ample facilities for instruction in the elements of 
learning, in morals, in good domestic habits, and in useful industries, and bestows a like 
care on them to that which the reform school gives boys, the age for admission being 
8to15. First opened in 1870 with 24 inmates, it had at the close of 1880 received 430, 
of whom 408 were dismissed and 138 returned... There were 160 in the school December, 
1880, of whom the primary department enrolled 52; the intermediate, 51; the higher, 57. 
The aim is to give a thorough common school education, together with such industrial 
training as will prepare for self support. The school is managed on the family plan, and 
has four houses, for which it is indebted mainly to individual gifts, about half of those 
enumerated in the report being from benevolent women. A fifth house is about to be 
added, an appropriation of $10,000 having been made for the purpose by the general as- 
sembly. The general result of the instruction given in the school is said to be that 75 pei 
cent. of the girls are saved.— (Reports, and letter from Rev. Thos. K. Fessenden.) 
TRAIN: FOR NUR: 
      
The Conneeticut Training School for Nurses, organized in 1873 with 4 pupils, reports 
17 under training at the New Haven Hospital during 1880-’81, besides 5 who had com- 
pleted their year of hospital study and service and remained at the school for the five 
months of outside practice required of all. Hight pupils received diplomas, having com- 
pleted the entire course of 18 months. Candidates for admission must be 22 to 40 years 
of age, of good character and sound health, and must sign a written agreement to remain 
under the direction of the school 18 months. At the end of their hospital course they 
are allowed a month for rest. During the first 12 months they receive board, lodging, 
tuition, and $2 a week; during the last 5, $14 a month and board. During the year 150

applications for nurses were made at the hospital, of which only 52 could be granted. A 
number of applications were also made for nurses to take charge of training schools.— 
(Eighth annual report of training school.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
CONNECTICUT STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-fifth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association, held in Hartford, 
October 27-29, 1881, was largely attended by teachers and educators from all parts of the 
State. The first address, by Rev. L. T. Chamberlain, of Norwich, on “Education and 
schools,’’ is described as one of the soundest ever delivered before the association; it 
showed the importance of moral, intellectual, and physical training, also touching on 
the question of sanitation in school building. 
On the second day the association met in sections, all three being largely attended. 
Before the primary section papers were read by Superintendent H. M. Harrington, of 
Bridgeport, by Miss Hattie Ball, of Middletown, and by Miss E. G. Cilly, of Norwich, on 
methods of teaching; Professor Sawyer, of New Britain, also spoke briefly on the subject 
' in the discussion that followed. ‘‘Language: its rank as a study and some methods of 
teaching it’’ was the subject of an essay by Mr. George R. Burton, of New Haven. Miss 
Fanning, of Norwich, read a paper on the same subject, and it was further discussed by 
a number of others. 
In the grammar school section Miss Ellen J. Whiton, of Waterbury, with the assist- 
ance of two pupils from her school, gave an object lesson in United States history by 
means of an ingenious arrangement of pieces of colored cambric pinned on an outline map of 
the United States; the pupils also rehearsed a history of the United States flag, unfolding 
flag after flag used in the revolutionary war before the present one was adopted. Mr. 
E. L. Mead, of Winsted, spoke on ‘‘'The school and the community,’’ and Mr. 8. T. 
Dutton, of New Haven, gave his views as to the duty of teachers to pupils. Mr. C. W. 
Walcott, of Waterbury, addressed the teachers on ‘‘ Three systems of musical notation: 
the staff notation, Galen’s figure notation, and tonic sol-fa notation,’’ after which an 
address on reading in grammar schools, by Prof. B. Huxley, of the Adelphi Academy, 
Brooklyn, N. Y., closed the programme. 
The first address before the high school section was by Mr. J. B. Welch, of Willi- 
mantic, on the place of biology in the high school, the speaker including under the term 
“hbiology,’’? botany, physiology, the classification of animals, zodlogy, and geology —in 
short, all manifestations of life. ‘The topic was discussed by Dr. Henry Barnard, Mr. 
Childs, of the Hartford High School, and others. The section considered the questions 
“Are the courses of study in the high schoois calculated to prepare the youth for a busi- 
ness life?’? and ‘‘ How shall we teach the scholar a correct method of study?’? The 
exercises of the section then closed with a lecture by Prof. Selah Howell, of New York, 
on ‘‘General history as an important element in the school course.’’ 
In the afternoon, the sections being united, officers were elected for the ensuing year, 
and an address was delivered by I. J. Osbun, of the State Normal School at Salem, 
Mass., on ‘‘ Methods and reguits,’’ illustrating with simple apparatus methods of teach- 
ing the operation of many of nature’s laws. In the evening,-a large number of citizens, 
as well as teachers, being present, an address was delivered by Hon. J. L. M. Curry, LL. D., 
of Richmond, Va., general agent of the Peabody education fund, on education at the 
South, in which he presented many interesting facts on that subject and argued that 
assistance should be given by the National Government. The closing exercises on Satur- 
day included an address from Mr. Mark Pitman, of New Hampshire, on Grube’s method 
© of teaching arithmetic, and one by Mr. A. P. Somes, of Danielsonville, on ‘‘ The proper 
use of text books.’’— (Journal of Education, November 3, 1881.) 
  CONNECTICUT COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
This association was organized in 1879 for the purpose of awakening public interest in 
education, promoting the,improvement of teachers, elevating the character of schools 
and increasing their efficiency, and establishing the profession of teaching on a better 
basis. Its semiannual sessions for 1881 were held in New Haven May 7 and November 
25-26. 
At the meeting in November the first business considered was the report of a commit- 
tee appointed to urge the passage of a bill concerning a State board of examiners for 
teachers. It was discussed by a number of prominent educators, but no definite contlu- 
sion seems to have been reached. The afternoon session was devoted to a discussion of 
the question ‘‘What is education?’ The next day the council considered the, topic 
“What is teaching ?’’— (Journal of Education.)

OBITUARY RECORD. ti 
FREDERICK W. GUNN. 
This well known and able teacher was founder and for nearly a third of a century prin- 
cipal of The Gunnery, a famous school for boys in Washington, Conn., his native place, 
where he died in August, 1881, after a useful life of more than three score years. Gradu- 
ating from Yale College in the ‘celebrated class of 1837, Mr. Gunn opened a school in his 
native town in 1838. But the movement for the abolition of slavery was then violently 
agitating the community, and Mr. Gunn, an ardent advocate of emancipation, excited such 
opposition by the advocacy of his principles that he was expelled from the church and 
driven out of thetown. He established a school at Towanda, Pa., but aftertwo years pub- 
lic sentiment at Washington had so changed that he thoughtit well to return, and in 1850 
he founded the school with which for 31 subsequent years his name was identified. 
Mr. Gunn’s method of training boys was unique. The central object he kept in view 
was the development of manhood, character, and physique. With these secured he 
believed that mental growth would follow. There was, therefore, no marking system 
and no direct incentive to purely intellectual’ growth, but earnestness was steadily cul- 
tivated in everything. Composition, rhetoric, and oratory had especial attention, A 
knowledge of public events was also made an important feature, Mr. Gunn himself read- 
ing the daily paper to the school. The honorable side of a boy’s character was assidu- 
ously cultivated. A lie was held to be an abomination, and tattling was studiously dis- 
couraged. With a keen insight into boy character, each one of several odd and original 
punishments for offences was levelled at a particular flaw, even the sports of the school 
being impressed into the prevailing punitive system. The effect of Mr. Gunn’s discipline 
was the creation of a general heartiness and manliness among the boys like that at Rugby 
under Dr. Arnold’s rule. 
The funeral of this much loved teacher was singularly touching. His former pupils 
gathered from far and near, from business, the professions, and college, 60 of them 
heading the procession.—(Pennsylvania School Journal, November, 1881.) 
REV. LEONARD BACON, D.,D., LL. D. 
Born in Detroit, Mich., February 19, 1802, Dr. Bacon died in New Haven, December 
24, 1881. His father, a missionary to the Ojibwa Indians, sent this son, in 1812, to 
Hartford, Conn., where he was educated by his uncle, Dr. Leonard Bacon. Entering 
Yale as a sophomore in 1817, he graduated in 1820 in the same class with T. D. Wool- 
sey, who subsequently became president of the college. He afterwards studied at 
Andover Theological Seminary, and in 1825 became pastor of the Centre Church, New 
Haven, in which post he always remained, becoming pastor emeritus in September, 
1866. He filled the chair of systematic theology at Yale from 1866 to 1871, and con- 
tributed largely to the improvement in the quality and fortunes of that school. In 
1871 he became lecturer on church history and polity. He also delivered lectures before 
the law department on ecclesiastical jurisprudence, was a contributor to the Christian 
Spectator from 1822 to 1838, and since 1843 furnished more than a hundred articles to 
the New Englander. In 1850 he aided in founding the New York Independent, and was 
for a long time its editor. He published, in 1846, a volume of essays on slavery, from 
which it is said President Lincoln gained his own decided antislavery views. In debate, 
especially at such gatherings as the meetings of the General Association of Connecticut 
and the American Board, he was always a leading spirit. He received the degree of p. 
p. from Hamilton College in 1843 and that of LL. D. from Harvard in 1870.— (Congre- 
gationalist, Boston.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. W. Harlan.) 
OFFICERS. 
For the State these consist of a superintendent and an assistant superintendent of free 
schools, both appointed annually by the governor; also, of a State board of education, com-

posed of the secretary of state, the president of Delaware College, and the State super- 
intendent, with the assistant superintendent as acting secretary. There are also school 
committees in each united school district, elected by the people for 3 years’ terms, with 
change of one member each year.— (School laws, 1881.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
To sustain the public schools there is “‘ the school fund of the State of Delaware,’ no 
part of which is to be used for academies, colleges, or universities. There are also local 
‘taxes, which in each of the school districts of New Castle County amount to $150; in 
those of Kent County, to $125; in Sussex County, to $60. In addition to such annual 
levies used in the school districts where they are raised, other sums may be levicd if 
required in several of the districts in these counties. The school fund apportioned to 
each county is to be distributed equally among all the districts of the county, except 
that in New Castle County one-seventh part is to be distributed among the districts con- 
tained within the city of Wilmington and the residue among the remaining districts 
equally. Teachers are required, under forfeiture of salary, to furnish quarterly reports 
to the proper authorities. These are the regulations for the schools of the white popu- 
lation. 
The schools for colored youth have a separate and distinct fund, which is under the 
charge of the Delaware Association for the Education of the Colored People. A tax of 
30 cents on the $100 of real and personal property and poll of colored persons is annually 
levied, and $2,400 are annually appropriated from the State treasury, commencing with 
October, 1881. No school is to receive its pro rata unless it has been taught at least 3 
months of the school year, with an average attendance of at least 15 scholars. The 
$2,400 are to be divided equally among the schools of New Castle, Kent, and Sussex Coun- 
ties. Exempted from the regular tax are several persons of Sussex County, who form a 
body politic entitled “‘The Indian River school districts for a certain class of colored per- 
sons.’? ‘They establish schools of their own, and vote the sum required, not to exceed 
$200, for the two subdistricts. Each school is to be open to children between the ages 
of 7 and 21 of the persons specified. From 1882 on, these schools are also to receive 4 pro 
rata share of the general school fund for colored, provided they too are taught at least 
3 months with an average attendance of 20 scholars and that $25 have been raised by 
taxation for each school during the year.— (Digest of school laws, 1881.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The indications for the year 1880-81 are favorable upon the whole. With an addition 
of 1,826 youth of school age there was an increase in enrolment of 1,299. And although 
this training seems to have been given by somewhat fewer teachers in the free schools, it 
is probable that this is only an apparent falling off, arising from the fact that teachers, 
being better prepared for their work and getting somewhat better pay, are more perma- 
nent in their positions. For the first time, too, the State recognizes its obligation to aid 
in the education of the colored people. A law was passed March 22, 1881, appropriating 
$2,400 from the State treasury for the colored schools. This is in addition to the tax of 
30 cents on $100, which, on their own petition, they have been allowed from 1875 to de- 
vote to education. 
\ KINDERGARTEN. 
For any schools of this grade, see Table V of the appendix, and a summary thereof in the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF WILMINGTON. 
OFFICERS. 
A city.superintendent and a board. of public education, made up of 2 members from 
each ward, have charge of the schools.— (City report.) 
STATISTICS. 
The total population, according to the census of 1880, was 42,478; youth of school age 
(6-21), not given; school-houses in use, 19; sittings, 5,864; enrolment, 7,065; average 
daily attendance, 4,392; teachers, 116; expenditures, $89,370.— (Report and return.) 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
Owing to the changes of teachers, to sickness, and to a severe winter, the work of 
the year was performed under unusual difficulties. Yet the schools were kept up to the 
high standard of the last few years, and at some points made advances. A revised 
course of study was introduced, so that there are now ten primary grades instead of twelve 
and six grammar grades instead of seven. The study of Latin and formal object lessons  
-P-A-G-E-314
36 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
were also discontinued. The increase in enrolment and attendance over the preceding 
year was occasioned by the annexing of a district to the city. Without this there would 
have been a decrease of 79 enrolled and 123 in average attendance. | No mention is made 
of the evening schools kept in former years. The normal school is probably continued, 
as the report states that 4 divisions in the training school are taught by pupil teachers 
who are in training and on trial.— (Report and return.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL CLASSES. 
As stated above, the normal school connected with the Wilmington school system 
seems to be still in existence, although no special account of it appears in the report of 
the city superintendent. It is stated, however, that, through the influence and instruc- 
tion of the principal of the training school, better methods were substituted in all the 
schools for the a b c method in teaching the alphabet and the first lessons in reading.— 
(City report, 1880-81.) 
The normal class reported in former years at Delaware College is apparently discon- 
tinued. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
‘The State superintendent of free schools is required to hold at least one teachers’ in- 
stitute, of at least three days in length, in each of the counties of the State. All teach- 
ers of the county are expected to be present unless unavoidably detained. The number 
of such institutes for 1881 is not known. One held in Sussex County was said to be 
thronged with people, who listened to the proceedings with evident interest. “A thorough 
appreciation of the cause of education was indicated.— (Laws of 1881 and Journal of 
Education. ) 
. SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. . 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In Wilmington there are five rooms used for high school classes. The two schools, one 
a combined high and grammar school for boys, the other for girls, enrolled 110 pupils, an 
increase of 13 over the previous year. The average daily attendance was 90, an increase 
of 17. From the boys’ school, which had 58 pupils, there were 6 graduates; in the girls’ 
department, 52 enrolled and 10 graduates. ‘The 3 years’ course is still continued. Re- 
vised courses of study were adopted by the board on January 24. These went into effect, 
in part, on February 1, and were to be fully carried out in September. The study of 
Latin was discontinued from the beginning of the year.— (City report, 1880-’81.) 
Outside of Wilmington only one public school is known which attempts any measure 
of secondary instruction. This is at Lewes. 
PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The Wilmington Conference Academy, Dover, occupies a notable position among the 
educational forces of the State. The school is coeducational. Particular attention is paid 
to the choice of teachers, the corps consisting of eight. Great care is taken to properly 
codrdinate all departments. Recent additions have been made to the library and to the 
scientific collections, and all connected with the school manifest great interest in making 
it an educational centre. 
For statistics of private academic schools reported, see Table VI of the appendix. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES. 
Delaware College, Newark, was first chartered in 1832, recharterd in 1867, and diopaed 
under reorganization in 187 0. The preparatory department (Newark Academy i is virtually 
such) had 6 instructors in 1881 and 80 students. The collegiate department (faculty 6, 
students 47) includes a 4 years’ classical course, one of similar length in science and agri- 
culture, and a 4 years’ literary course. The scientificand literary « courses were extended 
in 1879 from’ 3 to 4 years. Instruction in law —elementary, constitutional, and interna- 
tional —is given in the senior year. The college reports 30 scholarships, but no fellow- 
ae In 1881 8 degrees were conferred, 4 of A. B. and 4 of PH. D.— (Catalogue and re- 
turn.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The scientific and agricultural department of Delaware College admits students to the 
4 years’ course who are at least 14 years of age and who produce testimonials of good 
moral character and sustain an examination in the common English branches. In the 
scientific course, so called, there were 33 students in 1881. The method of instruction 
in this department is twofold. In addition to the recitations and lectures, the actual 
farming operations of the State become an objective study.— (Catalogue and returns. ) 
PROFESSIONAL. 
No professional schools are reported from the State of Delaware ; some instruction in 
law is given in the State College. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF DEAF-MUTES, THE BLIND, &C. 
The special schools of Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia furnish the training 
required by any such unfortunates in this State. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. ? 
The State Teachers’ Association held its third annual meeting at Rehoboth Beach, 
August 22-25, 1882. President William A. Reynolds, of Wilmington, delivered the in- 
augural address. This was followed by ‘‘ Improved methods of instruction,”’ State Super- 
intendents Groves and Carpenter reading the report and other gentlemen continuing the 
subject. Superintendent Harlan advocated normal schools as necessary to improve 
methods and teachers. President J. M. Williams, of Wesleyan Female College, urged the 
need of improved teachers. At the afternoon session an essay, by C. 8. Conwell, of 
Dover, on the beauty and usefulness of the study of Shakespeare was freely discussed. 
Rey. W. B. Gordon, of Smyrna, lectured in the evening on the cultivation of the beauti- 
fal. On the following day Principal S. J. Willey gave a paper on the “‘ Fourth profes- 
sion.’? He considered the profession of teaching equal in importance to the professions 
of theology, law, and medicine. By raising the standard of qualifications the number 
of teachers would be decreased and their pay and positions correspondingly increased, 
In ‘‘ The true sphere of the public school”’ Principal R. D. Harrington traced the history 
of the public school from its inception in Athens until the present. He stated that suc- 
cess is only attained when the curriculum is adapted to the peculiar wants of the people, 
to their condition, habits, and circumstances. Both of these topics led to discussion. 
At the evening session, Rev. A. W. Lightburn addressed the association on ‘‘ The princi- 
ples and perils of our common education.’? He argued for an education founded on 
christianity, virtue, and truth. On the last day of the session, Miss E. D. Fraser read a 
paper on ‘‘School authorities, their qualifications and duties.’’? The normal school ques- 
tion was then taken up. Among the resolutions offered, was one that it is the duty of 
teachers to extend their usefulness in the community, to keep up with the times: in 
methods of instruction, and to sustain the dignity of the “‘ fourth profession.’’— (Journal 
of Education. )

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The officers of the department of public instruction are a State superintendent of 
public instruction, a State board of education, a board of public instruction for each 
county, a county superintendent of schools, and local school trustees, treasurers, and 
agents.— (Laws. ) : 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The publicschools continued to be sustained from the proceeds of acommon school fund, 
of a special State tax of 1 mill on the $1, and of a county tax, made 2} to 4 mills on 
the $1 in 1881.1 The interest on the common school fund, with the amount raised by the 
1 mill tax, is apportioned annually by the State superintendent among the counties in 
proportion to the children residing therein between the ages of 4 and 21, and by the 
board of public instruction among the schools in proportion to the average attendance of 
pupils between 6 and 21. The s¢hools must be maintained at least 3 months each year. 
Any district? neglecting to maintain such school or schools forfeits its portion of the com- 
mon school fund during such neglect, and the fund thus forfeited is distributed among 
the counties at the next apportionment. The maximum school day is 6 hours; school 
month, 22 days; school term, 3 school months; school year, 3 terms. The school

census of children between 6 and 21 and 4 and 21 must be taken at the time of assess- 
ing county taxes. Persons duly authorized as teachers are required to teach deportment 
and morals, to inculcate the principles of truth, honesty, patriotism, and the practice of 
every christian virtue, and may devote one-half day in each week to instruction in some 
branches of needlework or manual labor. The constitution enjoins the legislature to 
provide a uniform system of common schools and a university, but no steps have yet 
been taken to establish the latter, exceptinits agricultural and mechanical departments. 
(Constitution and laws.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. , 
In the absence of official information as to statistics of 1880-’81, no comparison of the 
educational condition of that year with the preceding one can be made. Even the secre- 
tary and agent of the Peabody fund trustees, on whom the State has to depend for special 
aid towards the improvement of its schools, has had to content himself, in his report 
for 1881, with the statistics of the previous year. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
There is no separate city school system. The county officers have control of the city 
schools in common with those of the counties in which they are located. The only clear 
statistics to be had include county as well as city schools.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Jacksonville proper, with two outlying suburbs, appears from a printed county report 
to have had 1,100 pupils enrolled in its public schools and 903 in average attendance, 
under 22 teachers. The course of study covers 3 primary, 5 grammar, and 3 high school 
years, the high school serving for the county as well as the city, and bearing the title of 
Duval County High School. One of the city schools is a large graded one for colored 
pupils. This in 1880-’81 had 6 teachers besides the principal, enrolled 515 pupils, and 
had 445 in average attendance. Another graded school for the same race, under Metho- 
dist Episcopal influences, had 5 teachers and 166 pupils.— (Report for Duval County 
and of Freedmen’s Aid Society of Methodist Episcopal Church, 1881.) 
Key West, including Monroe County, presents no information additional to that in the 
table except that of the 795 pupils enrolled 191 were in the alphabet, 143 in first reader, 
136 in the second, 108 in the third, 82 in the fourth, 62 inthefifth, 33 in the sixth ; there 
were 550 in arithmetic, 568 in writing classes, 427 in geography, 283 in grammar, and 40: 
insuch higher studies as history, natural philosophy, chemistry, &c.— (Return.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOL. ‘ . 
The East Florida Seminary, Gainesville, established in 1853 and supported from the- 
proceeds of the national land grant, has served of late years as apublic graded school, but 
was organized in 1880 as aStatenormal. Thecourse extends through 3 years beyond a pre- 
paratory year, none being admitted to the normal course except after examination in the 
studies of the preparatory course. .Boys under 15 and girls under 14 cannot enter the 
normal classes. Besides other studies, the normal course embraces methods of teaching, 
school organization and management, history and. philosophy of education, and educa- 
tional psychology. ‘The classes below the normal ser*e as an experimental school for 
observation and practice teaching. Normal pupils may study Latin and Greek, but not 
to the detriment of the full English course. Instructors in 1880-’81, 7; normal pupils, 
13; other pupils, 140.— (Catalogue and return.) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
No,record of such means of improving teachers has reached the Bureau at the time at. 
which this goes to press, though they were held in 1880.

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
For these schools in 1880—81 no definite information is at hand. In 1879-’80, about 
5,000 pupils were studying the higher branches, but the number of high schools was not 
given, Jacksonville and Key West, as well as the West and East Florida Seminaries, 
had high school departments, and other schools elsewhere may havehad. Lincoln Acad- 
emy, Leon County, which in 1879-’80, through aid from the Peabody fund, had a prin- 
cipal and 4 assistants, was operated for 9 months, and was said to be ‘‘the only high 
school for colored youth in the county.’’ 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of academic schools, see Table VI of the ‘appendix, and the summary 
thereof in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
) SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
No institution of this class had been established in Florida up to the year under re- 
view, nor does any appear to have been projected in that year. The constitution of 1868 
required the legislature to provide for a university as well as for a system of common 
schools, instruction in both to be free. But as no time was fixed for the establishment 
of the university and as education in the State has not in any past year reached the point 
of fair demand for high collegiate training, there has been no action taken by the legis- 
lature towards furnishing it, except as mentioned below under Scientific Instruction. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
No schools of this class appear to have been yet called for in this State, the compara- 
tively slight demand for this grade of instruction for young women being sufficiently met 
by several colleges for women in adjoining States. 
\ y SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION, 
SCIENTIFIC. 
No ittosiation has been obtainable as to the State Agricultural College, which in 1876 
‘was located at Eau Gallie, in the southern section of the State, beyond the fact that at 
the opening of 1881 it remained still at Eau Gallie, whence it was to have been removed, 
and that it had an endowment fund of more than $120,000. This college is the only 
department of the State university that has been organized, and its existence has been 
threatened by a proposition to appropriate its fund to common school purposes or use it 
to endow a normal seminary, with an agricultural department. 
No schools for professional training, except of teachers, existed in 1881. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. . 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND, DEAF, AND FEEBLE-MINDED. 
Information as to what is done by the State towards the training of its poorer youth of - 
these classes has been sought in vain. Theconstitution of 1868 requires that ‘‘institutions 
for the-benefit of theinsane, blind, and deaf, and such other benevolentinstitutions as the 
public good may require, shall be fostered and supported by the State,’”’ and it is hoped 
that the spirit of this requirement may be carried out by placing such unfortunates in 
the training schools of other States until Florida can make provision for them herself. 
The fact that the quadriennial census of youth of school age is required to include a 
special one of deaf-mutes looks in this direction. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
MEETINGS OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND OTHERS. 
The school law requires and empowers the State superintendent of public instruction 
‘to call meetings of county superintendents of schools and other officers, for obtaining 
and imparting information on the practical workings of the school system and the means 
of promoting its efficiency and usefulness.’’ The last State superintendent, in his report 
for 1880, showed that he had cémplied with this requirement, calling meetings and de- 
livering addresses to school officers and others at from one to four points in each county 
with apparently useful results. The biennial report of his successor on this and other 
matters for 1881 and 1882 is not due at the date at which this goes to press.

OFFICERS, 
For the State there is a board of education, composed of the chief executive officers, with 
the governor as president ex officio, and a State school commissioner as chief executive offi- 
cer; for each county (the counties here being school districts),! a county board of educa-   
1 Except in 4 counties, in which the election of the county board is provided for by special acts.  
-P-A-G-E-320
    42 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
tion of 5 freeholders, appointed by the grand jury, a secretary elected by it being ex officio 
county school commissioner and holding for 4 years; for each subdistrict into which the 
au. ae be divided, 3 trustees appointed by the county board for local supervision.— 
aws. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The annual State school fund is derived from a poll tax of $1 and from aspecial tax on 
shows, exhibitions, and sales of spirituous and malt liquors; from the proceeds of commu- 
tation taxes for military service; from certain sums received from two railroads; from edu- 
cational funds not belonging to the State university;! and from such other sums as may 
be raised by general taxation. District taxation is allowed for supplying suitable school 
buildings and furniture. ' 
High schools are cut off, except in specially chartered districts, as the constitution of 
1877 provides only for studies in the elementary branches. Provision is made for even- 
ing, ambulatory, and manual labor schools. White and colored children must be taught 
in separate schools, with equal advantages to both according to their grade. Sectarian 
books must not be introduced into the schools, nor must the reading of the Bible be for- 
bidden. The county board decides what text books and books of reference shall be used 
in the common schools of the county. The county commissioner examines candidates 
for teaching, and recommends them to the county board for such grade of license as they 
may merit, which shall be good for 1, 2, or 3 years, according to its grade; except in some 
counties especially exempted, he must visit the schools in his county at least twice each 
year, make, once in 4 years, an enumeration of' the children of school age (6-18) in his dis- 
trict, and distribute the school fund received on the basis of the number of such, and 
report annually to the State superintendent. Teachers must report to the county com- 
missioner at the close of each term; he to the State commissioner, who reports annually 
tothe assembly. Failure to do this involves forfeiture ofpay. Principals ofall other than 
State schools, having public pupils, must also report. To entitle a county to its propor- 
tion of the State fund, primary schools must have been kept open, free to all, at least 3 
months of the year throughout the county, except where, on account of sparseness of pop- 
ulation, the primary schools cannot be maintained for that time; in this case the county 
boards can provide for such schools to continue 2 months only in different places convenient 
to the majority of the pupils, each school to contain not less than 15 pupils. The school 
term must be so arranged that the same teacher may serve in 1, 2, 3, or more schools suc- 
cessively.— (Constitution and laws.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics for 1881 show fair advance in the condition of the public schools. The 
enrolment materially advanced, the greatest part of the increase being in colored pupils, 
and the average daily attendance bore a good proportion to the increased enrolment. 
There were 139 more public schools and 128 more public school teachers. A large fall- 
ing off was reported in the number of pupils and number of teachers in private schools. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
The report of this fund, made at the regular meeting of the trustees in October, 1881, 
shows that Georgia received $4,200 for training teachers a8 Nashville, $500 for colored 
pupils at Atlanta, and $600 for the Georgia agency. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
Cities of over 20,000 inhabitants may have boards of education or of trustees of schools, 
of whom a part are in some cases members ex officio, as mayors of the city or judges of 
the courts. The elective membéts are in most cases subject to partial annual change. 
Those of Augusta, Macon, and Savannah combine county and city systems, a superin- 
tendent being employed in each of these cases.— (City reports and laws.)

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Atlanta reported 10 schools, classed as high, grammar, and primary. The grammar 
schools comprised each 8 grades, corresponding to the first 8 years of school life, 6 to 14, 
while the high school for girls comprised 4 grades, answering to the next 4 years of school 
life. The course in the boys’ high school covered only 3 years, differing in the studies 
to be pursued mainly in the substitution of optional Greek for French. The general 
enrolment reached 4,226, with an average per cent. of 93.2 in daily attendance, and at 
an annual cost per scholar of $10.83, while in the high schools there were enrolled 302, 
with an average per cent. of 94.6 in daily attendance. There was still a pressure for 
more school room for both primary grades and high schools. A new school-house erected 
during the year for the colored children, containing 8 large rooms, well lighted and ven- 
tilated, is said to be the pride of the colored people. It is, at their request, officered by 
educated colored teachers, who have demonstrated that they understand their own race 
and know how to teach and preserve discipline.— (Tenth annual report, 1880-81.) 
Augusta had a well graded system of public schools, classed as primary, intermediate, - 
grammar, and high. The primary had a 3 years’ course; the intermediate and gram- 
mar, 2 years’ courses. The high school department included 3 schools, 2 of them for 
white and 1 for colored pupils. One of the 3 was for girls alone; the other 2 for both 
sexes. The full course was 3 years. These high schools had in 1880-’81 an enrolment 
of 152; an average, monthly, of 108 present; an average, daily, of 94, of whom 13 were 
graduated. The high school for colored pupils completed with the year a2 years’ course, 
and a question was raised whether it should be continued of that length or be extended 
to 3 years; but, as the rule of the board is that the high schools shall have 3 classes, each 
of a year, it is hardly possible that one race should be deprived of the advantages given 
to the other. The superintendent reports that there has been a steady advance both in 
enrolment and average attendance in the schools, many citizens having withdrawn their 
children from private instruction and placed them in the public schools. The increased 
pressure in the colored schools was such that out of 1,132 pupils only 723 could be fur- 
nished with seats.— (Report. ) 
Columbus had 7 school buildings, on 4 lots, used for both primary and grammar grades, 
with 1,182 sittings, valued, with grounds, &c., at $35,200. Instruction was given in 
music. In the absence of any normal school, the superintendent gratuitously gave some 
teei ion to the teachers. In private and parochial schools, 250 were enrolled.— 
Return. 
Macon.— For the city there were 7 school buildings, with 37 rooms and 1,500 sittings. 
During the year a large building that had been used for a medical college was added to 
the school accommodations, making the value of school property $43,000. There was 
a marked advance in all departments over even that of 1879-’80. In the matter of 
organization, the schools for whites approached very near the completion of the city plan, 
comprising 3 full grade schools for elementary and grammar classes, with a central school 
of higher grade, the whole embracing a course of study beginning with elementary school 
work and extending through the studies preparatory to college or to the better class of 
business positions. In this last school the graduating class for the year (25) was the 
highest ever graduated, and the increased attendance such as to render necessary the 
enlargement of the building to accommodate, in another year, the growing enrolment. 
Provision for the colored school population was also much advanced, so that, for the first 
time since the adoption of the city system, the colored pupils were accommodated in build- 
ings supplied by the city without cost to the board, and with capacity for from 150 to 
200 additional scholars. The revised course of study covers 9 years. Enrolled in private 
and parochial schools, 300.— (Ninth annual report and return.) 
Savannah had 7 school buildings, with 56 rooms for study and recitation and 3,200 
sittings, valued, including grounds, &c., at $130,300. In some rooms there was over- 
crowding; rather than refuse admittance to any and to relieve the teachers of this over- 
charge, many unqualified children were put into the higher grades. It was thought 
better to suffer this evil than to reject the large number of applicants. There were 7 
schools for whites and 2 for colored. The schools below the high reached a per cent. 
of average daily attendance on average belonging of 89.5 whites and 88.5 colored. 
Below the high school there are 8 grades, beginning with the lowest elementary studies 
and ending in a preparation for the high. There are 2 high schools, 1 for boys and 1 for 
girls, each having a 4 years’ course and nearly the same studies, with an enrolment of 
169, an average belonging of 137, an average daily attendance of 127, and 23 graduates. 
The instruction in the schools is meant to be conservative. Except in language study, 
progress was satisfactory. Fully 25 percent. of the teachers were graduates of the public 
schools; and it was to be the policy to give the colored schools in the country their share 
of these well qualified teachers. There was improvement inthe discipline. Much atten- 
tion was given to hygienic principles, with pleasing results in the physical as well as the 
mental health of the pupils. Enrolment in private and parochial schools, 500.— (Sixteenth 
annual report and return.)

44 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
  There being no State normal school, as such, the higher normal instruction of a few 
specially selected whites from this State was conducted at the normal college at Nash- 
ville, Tenn., the Peabody fund providing for the instruction of some 20 scholars dur- 
- ing the year 1881.— (Peabody fund report. ) 
The North Georgia Agricultural College, at Dahlonega, has a normal department free to 
such of either sex as wish to become teachers. The trustees enjoyed the right to send 
pupils during the fall months to remote school districts not otherwise provided for, 
pledging their support while thus engaged. Those who complete the regular course of 
4 years receive a certificate which exempts them from examination by any other school 
authorities in the State. Statistics for 1880—’81.are not available. 
Atlanta University, Atlanta (for the superior training of the colored race), presented 
again, in 1880-81, the 4 years’ normal course formerly termed the higher normal, the 
requirements for entering which were the same as for the college preparatory course. 
Young women entering this course, in addition to the customary studies, are taught such 
elements of household science as plain sewing, cookery, nursing the sick, and the prepa- 
ration of simple dietary articles for them. Specimens of their sewing work are preserved 
for examination. They receive, at the completion of the course, certificates of graduation 
that are equivalent to teachers’ certificates. The former normal course, below that above 
mentioned, became in 1880-81 the grammar school course.—(Catalogue. ) 
The Haven Normal School, Waynesboro, like that at Atlanta, is for.the instruction of 
colored teachers. It is assisted by the Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episco- 
pal Church, and had a 4 years’ course of study. There were 80 pupils under 2 teachers 
in 1880-’81.— (Methodist Year Book.) 
Clark University, Atlanta, has a normal department for the instruction of colored teach- 
ers, which includes all studies of the English course and 2 years additional.— (Catalogue. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. * The State school law makes no provision for the holding of teachers’ institutes. The 
State superintendent, at latest date, was endeavoring to secure from the assembly an 
appropriation of $1,500, which, with a supplemental sum that he had no doubt could be 
obtained from the Peabody fund, would enable him to establish in 1880-’81 from three 
to five such institutes in the State.— (State report.) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
Georgia, having no educational journal, has to depend on the educational periodicals 
of other States for the early publication of school matters pertaining to the State. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC, HIGH SCHOOLS, 
The constitution of 1877 made no provision for high school instruction in the public 
schools. In the cities and counties under local laws, 16 schools of this grade were re- 
ported by the State school commissioner in 1880, but neither enrolment nor attendance 
was given. From reports of cities received at this Bureau it appears that Atlanta, Au- 
gusta, and Savannah had each two separate high schools for boys and girls in 1881, as 
previously, with courses of from 3 to 4 years. The courses in all were the same, except 
that Atlanta had 3 years for boys and 4 for girls, differing throughout but slightly in 
required studies, which, so far as stated, are of the highest grade below college. Atlanta 
had 7 teachers, 302 enrolled pupils, 286 in average daily attendance, and graduated 35. 
Augusta had 2 high schools for whites and 1 for colored, for which see page 43. Savan- 
nah enrolled 169, and with an average daily attendance of 127 graduated 23. Macon 
and Sandersville had each 1 high school, the latter having a course of 3 years, while 
that of the former is not given. Macon Central High School had 2 teachers, 101 pupils, 
and an average daily attendance of 81; it graduated 25, the highest number ever reached. 
(City reports and returns. ) 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
As indicated for 1879-’80, there were 131 private high schools reported in that year, 
with 274 instructors and 9,052 pupils; similar information for 1881 shows 119 such 
schools, with 227 teachers and 7,841 pupils. Among these schools is Clark University, 
Atlanta, an institution for the higher education of the colored people, supported by the 
Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1881 this school shows a 
college course of fair standard for such a school, a good preparatory course, and 2 college 
classes. There is, too, a course in carpentry and architecture, in which instruction is
-P-A-G-E-323
  
GEORGIA. 45 
given in building and cabinet work. Girls are trained in sewing, laundry work, and 
house keeping. ‘To these will be added, as fast as means are furnished, agriculture, iron 
work, and practical business. In 1880 the main college building was erected at a cost 
of over $30,000, to which is attached a farm of 450 acres. The enrolment for 1879~’81 
was 277, with 8 teachers. — (Catalogue. ) é 
For statistics of commercial schools, academies, special preparatory. schools, and pre- 
paratory departments of colleges, seeTables IV, VI, VL, and IX of the appendix, and 
the summaries thereof in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Georgia, Athens, had for 1881 academic, State college, law, and med- 
ical departments, besides 4 branch colleges in different parts of the State. Under the 
academic were 10 schools, out of which were formed the classical, scientific, and literary 
courses of 4 years,each; in the first 2 of these the studies were substantially the same. 
In the academic department there were 93 students in 1881. For the other departments, 
reference is made to their proper headings, further on.— (Catalogue. ) 
Atlanta University, Bowdon and Gainesville Colleges (non-sectarian), Mercer Univer- 
sity, (Baptist), Pio Nono (Roman Catholic), Emory College (Methodist Episcopal South), 
had classical courses of 4 years, also preparatory (except Mercer. University) and scien- 
tific (Gainesville and Bowdon not reporting). Pio Nonoreported a junior class in civil 
engineering, graduate courses in ethics, a commercial course, and special instruction in 
military drill. Atlanta University continued to give normal, theological, and agricult- 
ural instruction; Emory College, biblical study in both its classical and scientific courses, 
while Mercer University continued its theological and legal departments.—(Catalogues. ) 
Emory College received in 1881 the handsome donation of $50,000 from Mr. George I. 
Seney, of New York, $20,000 of it for building, $5,000 to pay indebtedness, and $25,000 
to endow a Lovick Pierce professorship.— (Christian Advocate.) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Atlanta University and, as last heard from, Bowdon and Giainesville Colleges gave’ equal 
instruction to young women. Gainesville College is reported by its recent president 
as of a grade not above a city high school. He also reports the organization in 1881 of 
another institution, termed Methodist College, at Gainesville, giving to both sexes equal 
privileges. The course, however, as given in its catalogue of 1881, shows it to have been 
in that year only of the standard of a good preparatory school.— (Catalogues and return. ) 
Wesleyan Female College, Macon, one of the institutions here referred to, is reported to- 
have received from Mr. George I. Seney, of New York, $50,000, in 1880-81, for the im- 
provement of its educational advantages. (Educational Weekly, April 7, 1881.) 
For statistics of schools of this class, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary 
thereof, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
For training in this direction there are the scientific and philosophic courses of the 
University of Georgia, Athens, with the schools of agriculture, engineering, and applied 
chemistry in the State College. of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, also at Athens, all 
of 4 years, while at Mercer University, Macon, and at Emory College, Oxford, there were 
in 1881 scientific courses of 3 years, and at Pio Nono College, Macon, one of 2 eleniéntary 
and 2 nominally collegiate years. Of the courses in the 3 colleges last named, that at 
‘Emory College appears to be the fullest and best arranged. The 4 branches of the State 
College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, at Cuthbert, Dahlonega, Milledgeville, and 
Thomasville, although styled agricultural, present in their courses very slight indications 
of any work in the line of either agriculture or mechanics. They seem to serve largely, 
in their lower grades, the purpose of public schools; in their higher ones, that of pre- 
paratory schools for the State university, one giving also some normal training.— (Cata- 
Jogues and returns. ) 
Of the institutions for superior instruction of young women, to be found in Table VIII, 
the following report chemical laboratories and apparatus for illustrating physics: Lucy Cobb 
Institute, Athens; Columbus Female College; Andrew Female College, Cuthbert; Monroe 
Female College, Forsyth; Griffin Female College, Griffin; Southern Female College, La

46 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—Emory College, Oxford (Methodist Episcopal South), and Mercer Uni- 
versity, Macon (Baptist), both for whites, and the Atlanta Baptist Seminary, Clark Uni- 
versity (Methodist Episcopal), and Atlanta University (Congregational), all 3 at Atlanta, 
‘and all for colored, give theological instruction to some extent, though in none is any defi- 
nite course of study reported. The Atlanta Baptist Seminary, under the auspices of the 
American Baptist Home Missionary Society, had in 1880-81 a class of 44 preparing for 
the ministry. Mercer University gave theological instruction in connection with the regu- 
lar college studies, also full attention to those who chose to devote themselves exclusively 
to the study of theology; in Emory College Hebrew was taught in the junior and senior 
collegiate years; Atlanta University had a theological alumni class of 4.— (Catalogues 
and Baptist Year Book, 1882.) \ 
Legal.—The legal departments of the University of Georgia, Athens, and Mercer Uni- 
versity, Macon, continued to give legal instruction. In the former the regular course 
occupies 1 year of 2 terms, 4} months each, with a provision for a 2 years’ course for those 
who may desire it. If prepared, students may enter either the junior or senior class, but 
cannot graduate without studying at least 1 term. Those who finish the course receive 
diplomas which admit them to the bar of the superior courts of the State without exami- 
nation. After 7 years of successful practice and the maintenance of a good moral char- 
acter, graduates may be admitted to a higher degree. 
The course at Mercer occupies the collegiate year; the degree of LL.B. is conferred. 
(State report arid catalogue.) A 
Medical.—The Atlanta Medical College; Southern Medical College, also at Atlanta ; 
Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, and Savannah Medical College, all regular, re- 
quire courses of 3 years’ study under a preceptor and attendance on 2 full lecture terms, 
those at the Medical College of Georgia and Southern Medical College being 5 months, 
at Savannah College 4, and at Atlanta between 4and 5. All require a final examina- 
tion and a thesis, except the Medical College of Georgia, which in 1880 made this last 
optional. It also, in 1881, offered a 3 years’ course, with examinations at the close of 
each annual term, offering at the same time an optional laboratory course in practical 
chemistry at a slight charge. The Atlanta Medical College had 11 instructors and 134 
students, and graduated 31; the Southern Medical College, 11 instructors and 95 stu- 
dents, graduating 38. The Medical College of Georgia had 8 instructors and 91 students, 
and conferred on 36 the degree of M. D., with 1 honorary M.D. Savannah College made 
no report for 1881.— (Catalogues and returns.) 
For statistics respecting the schools of theology, law, and medicine, see Tables XI, 
XII, and XIII in the appendix; for summaries of the same, corresponding tables in the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL ASU GUNG 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Georgia Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Cave Spring, in 
1880-81 had 5 instructors, and 71 students, 9 of whom were semi-mutes. The pupils 
are instructed in the English language, geography, grammar, natural philosophy, natural 
history, arithmetic, penmanship, shoemaking, and gardening. Preparations for a col- 
ored department were approaching completion at the close of 1881.— (Annals of the Deaf 
and Dumb, 1882.) : 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Georgia Academy for the Blind, Macon, reported 6 instructors for 1880-81, with 
61 pupils, 4 blind employés and workmen, and 217 pupils since the opening of the in- 
stitution in 1852. The ordinary English branches are taught, with special instruction 
in instrumental and vocal music. The girls are trained in sewing, knitting, and domestic 
work, while the boys are taught broom and mattress working, cane seating, and turning. 
The State appropriation of $10,000 for a colored department had not been used at the 
close of 1881, but the trustees hoped at an early day to press the work forward to com- 
pletion.— (Annual report and return.) 
For further information respecting schools for the.deaf, dumb, and blind, see Tables 
XVIII and XIX in the appendix, and the summaries thereof in the report of the Com- 
missioner preceding. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS.

business meeting the usual papers were dispensed with to enable the teachers to attend 
the sessions of the National Educational Association. A committee was appointed to 
secure funds for the publication of a memorial volume to be issued by the association 
respecting the late Superintendent Bernard Mallon. After the election of officers for the 
ensuing year the association adjourned to meet at Augusta on the first Tuesday in May, 
1882.— (Journal of Education.) 
The fourth convention of the Middle Georgia Teachers’ Association was held at Sparta 
December 22-23, 1881, Dr. G. J. Orr in the chair. After an address of welcome and 
reports from the secretary and treasurer, papers were read and discussions had on ‘‘ Tem- 
perament of children;’’ “‘The best means of preserving order in school;” ‘‘The best 
course of study for those who have but two or three years of school;’’ ‘‘ The art of ex- 
planation;” “‘Toyal teachers, and what will make them such; ‘‘ Truth and honesty;’’ 
‘Mistakes of trustees, parents, teachers, pupils, and citizens.’’ , The closing address 
was by the State school commissioner, Hon. G. J. Orr, on the ‘‘Public school system of 
Georgia,” after which the committees made their reports, the usual officers were elected, 
and the association adjourned.— (Journal of Education.}

(From report of Hon. James P. Slade, State superintendent of public instruction, for 
187980, and from statistics furnished by him for 1880-’81.) 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of public instruction, elected quadriennially by the people, 
has general oversight of school matters. A county superintendent in each county also 
serves for 4 years. There are 3 trustees for each township, elected for 3 years’ terms,
-P-A-G-E-327
  ILLINOIS. 49 
  with annual change of 1. Three school directors in each district are also elected for 
similar terms. Women are eligible to any school office if they are over 21 years of age 
and possess the requisite qualifications.— (Laws, 1879.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Free schools were established by law in 1825. They are now maintained from a State 
allowance of $1,000,000 annually and from local taxes, not to exceed 2 per cent. for cur- 
rent expenses or 3 per cent. for building purposes. The apportionment of funds from 
these sources is in each county according to the number of children under 21 years of : 
age, and no school funds are to Toned to support any sectarian institution. Colored 
youth are admitted to all privileges of the free schools. The length of school term is 5 
months of 22 days each. The branches of study are arranged by the directors. Text 
books, not to be changed oftener than once in 4 years, are to be uniform. Teachers are 
to make the proper reports and to have certificates of qualification in order to be paid for 
their services.— (Laws, 1879.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
In. common with 16 other States, Mlinois makes only biennial reports of its school 
system, and 1881 was not the year for one of these; but Superintendent Slade has made 
up, as far as possible, this lack by furnishing from the records in his office the main sta- 
tistics for the year. These indicate a decrease of enrolment in all schools reaching about 
one-third of the decrease in school youth, and a decrease in average attendance in public 
schools of nearly two-thirds of the falling off in the number to be instructed. As to 
school districts, it appears that, while 5 more reported, there were 5 more that had no 
school and 11 fewer that had schools open the full legal time; 95 fewer reported school 
libraries, but these had more books in their libraries than the number reporting the year 
before. As to schools, we find a falling off of 3 on the preceding year, but the character 
of these schools was somewhat higher, 26 more being graded and 4 more being of high 
school grade, while 259 had new buildings, 42 of which were absolute additions to the 
school system. Through this building and rebuilding school property was rated $1,080,744 
higher, although private and church schools somewhat declined. As to teachers, many 
fewer men and many more women were employed, both sexes getting rather more re- 
munerative pay; while, as to funds, there was a fair addition to receipts for schools, with 
a considerable increase of expenditure upon them, the permanent fund having, moreover, 
$197,979 added to it. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For information as to this class of elementary schools for young children, see Table V 
of the appendix; for a summary of their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
Cities of 2,000 inhabitants or more, not governed by any special act, have boards of 
education consisting of 6 members, with 3 more whenever 10,000 inhabitants are added. 
In cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants the boards consist of 15 members. In both 
cases the term is of 3 years, with change of one-third annually.— (Laws. )

  50 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
No information has reached this Bureau from Alton, Aurora, Bloomington, Cairo, and 
Hyde Park. 
Belleville reported 2,000 sittings for study; an average daily attendance of 48 pupils to 
each teacher; an increase in enrolment and attendance over the previous year; improve- 
ment in discipline and in the manner of imparting instruction; book-keeping introduced 
in the eighth grade schools; and so large a number of pupils in these high grades as to 
necessitate the establishment of an extra school.— (Report and return.) 
Chicago reported the completion of 8 new buildings, with seating accommodations for 
6,804 pupils, and the commencement of 5 others, 4 of which will seat 3,591 children. At 
the close of the school year, owing to lack of room, there were 118 half day divisions — 
6,668 pupils in all. The financial interests of the schools improved greatly: the school 
fund rentals and State dividend increased and the boar i saved a portion of its annual 
tax levy. General progress was reported in all departments. This was especially no- 
ticeable in arithmetic, penmanship, and German. This language was introduced into 
most of the grammar schools, and in these 4,546 pupils took lessons. Adding the num- 
ber taught in the high schools there were 4,827 in all. During the year the courses of 
study in the high schools were so changed as to create 3 high schools, having full 4 years’ 
courses and a 3 years’ classical course. A change was also made in the mode of admis- 
sion, for which see Secondary Instruction. Five deaf-mute schools were carried on, with 
6 teachers and 55 pupils. Evening schools, suspended the previous year, were taught 3 
months; enrolment, 3,344; teachers, 59; expenditures, $8,376.— (City report, 1881. 
The Danville schools were taught 195 days, and the results of the year’s work were very 
gratifying. A change was made from monthly to bimonthly examinations. Promotion 
was based on a combination of these and on the final examinations in all branches. The 
course of study in the‘high school was thoroughly revised, anda number of changes made 
in the work of the different grades. Six school buildings and 31 schools, in 34 rooms, are 
reported.— (City report.) 
Decatur reports 25 teachers in the ward schools and 5 in the highest grade; the aver- 
age age of pupils, 10.6 years; average percentage of attendance, 94.6; highest salary paid 
to male teachers, $1,200; paid to women, $575. Of the 1,912 pupils enrolled 420 were not 
tardy during the year and 60 neither absent nor tardy.— (Report. ) 
Elgin values her school property at $28,230; reports 1,120 sittings for study, in 7 public 
school buildings; and had 7 private schools, with 628 pupilsenrolled. The schools were 
open 185 days.— (Return. ) 
Freeport reports school property worth $80,500; the 25 schools taught 196 days; 2,000 
sittings forstudy. A special teacher of German was employed. The gradesare primary, 
x, and high.— (Return and report.) 
Galesburg had 7 different school buildings, accommodating 1,800 pupils; an average 
daily attendance of 41 to each teacher; a special teacher of penmanship provided; the 
schools open 177 days; and school property valued at $136,200. Teachers in evening 
ae oC spoken of, but no mention is made of the number or length of such schools.— 
‘Return. 
Jacksonville reported school property worth $160,700; 7 different school buildings, con- 
taining 1,530 sittings; 1,000 sittings in private schools; and the schools taught 188 days. 
(etn one enrolment, 1,895; private, 1,200. No special teachers were reported.— 
‘Return. ‘ 
Joliet had 9 school buildings, valued, with furniture and apparatus, at $62,500; a total 
of 2,530 sittings, including 600 for private schools; and the usual high, grammar, and 
primary grades. The schools were taught 198 days.— (Return. ) 
Peoria (township) reports 15 school buildings, divided into primary, grammar, and high 
grades; 4,306 sittings; 3 evening schools, in which the teachers were paid $40 a month; 
1,580 pupils enrolled in private and parochial schools; and school property worth 
$201,200.— (Return. ) 
Quincy had 3,121 sittings for study, in 9 buildings, which accommodated high, gram- 
mar, and primary grades. The estimated value of school property was $210,700; en- 
rolment in private schools, 1,700; schools taught 196 days. A teacher of German was 
employed, at a salary of $450.— (Return. ) 
Rockford reports school property worth $120,000; 10 school buildings, containing 2,290 
sittings for study; a special teacher of music employed; schools taught 194 days; and 
enrolment in private schools, 460.— (Return. ) 
Rock Island had 7 school buildings, valued, with furniture and apparatus, at $102,600, 
and containing 1,958 sittings for study. A special drawing teacher was employed in the 
schools, which were taught 177 days. There were 506 pupils enrolled in private and 
parochial schools.— (Return. ) 
Springfield reports a gain over last year in the number of pupils attending school. Ex- 
cluding the pupils in the high school, there were 2,638 children registered in the 6 ward

schools. The percentage of attendance on average number belonging in all the schools was 
96.6; number of cases of tardiness, 1,173. The amount expended for the schools was 
$36,181; receipts, $37,242. School property was valued at $197,500 (grounds, apparatus, 
and furnishings included); it consisted of 6 buildings with 2,300 sittings for study. The 
schools were taught 198 days.— (Report and return. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE AND COUNTY NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The Southern Illinois Normal University, Carbondale, and the Illinois State Normal Uni- 
versity, Normal, both State institutions, report as follows: The former had 170 students 
in the normal department, where the courses were of 3 and 4 years, respectively, and 224 
in the 2 years’ preparatory course. The latter had 438 normal and 264 preparatory stu- 
dents, a 3 years’ normal course, and about two hundred in attendance at the special 
term for teachers in August. A very large attendance was also reported at the summer 
term of the Southern Illinois Normal, and the success in the higher branches of natural 
history was particularly noticeable. 
The Cook County Normal and Training School,1 Normalville, reports a regular 3 years’ 
course, while high school graduates who pass the required examination stay one year and 
one term. In January, 1881, a Kindergarten was added to the training department. 
There were 223 normal students, 11 pupils in the normal class of the Kindergarten 
department and 22 in the practice class, 127 in the training department and 108 in the 
preparatory course.— (Catalogues and returns.) 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
These are the Evangelical Lutheran Normal School, Addison, which had 8 teachers and 125 
students; the Aurora Normal School, Aurora, adepartment of Jennings Seminary, with a 
2 years’ course; the Northern Illinois College and Normal School, Fulton, 105 normal stu- 
dents and a 2 years’ course; the Northwestern German-English Normal School, Galena, 51 
normal students and a 3 years’ normal course; Morris Normal and Scientific School, Mor- 
ris, a normal course of 3 years, attended by 246 students; and the Teachers’ Training 
School and School of Individual Instruction, Oregon, which reports the studies and time 
optional, and 77 normal students to December, 1881. Normal courses or departments 
are also found at the following colleges and universities: Hedding, Eureka, Irvington, 
McKendree, Chaddock, Westfield, and Wheaton Colleges, and at Lake Forest and North- 
western Universities.— (Catalogues and returns. ) 
  TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Owing to the lack of a State report the number of institutes held in 1881 is unknown. 
There were, however, 7,291 teachers in attendance at these meetings. This shows a 
decrease of 1,133 over the previous year, when 372 institutes, with 8,424 teachers, were 
reported. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
These, for 1881, were the Present Age, of Chicago, a continuation of the former Ed- 
ucational Weekly; the American Educator, Lockport, in its fifth volume in 1881; the 
Practical Teacher, Chicago, in its fourth; and the Normal Worker, Morris, in its second. 
The following additional ones came into existence in 1881: The Schoolmaster, a fort- 
nightly publication, begun in January; the School Herald, also fortnightly, in February, 
both of Chicago; the Illinois School Journal, a monthly, begun in May at Normal, the 
seat of the Illinois Normal University, and the Normal Journal, Carmi, begun in August. 
Besides these papers, actually of the State, the Iapi Oaye, or Word Carrier, was pub- 
lished at Chicago, to aid in the education of Indian children at the Dakota mission in 
Nebraska. 
Of papers for general news the Inter-Ocean, at Chicago, seems to have devoted most 
space to education, having a weekly column of educational information. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The number of such schools reported for 1880-’81 was 114, and these, as in 1879-’80, 
are believed to represent schools with at least a 3 years’ course actually pursued by the 
pupils, as Superintendent Slade had asked in 1880 that only such should be classed in 
the reports as high schools. Four years’ courses existed in 63 of the schools in 1879-80. 
An important change was made at Chicago at the close of 1880-81 in the mode of ad-

mission to the city high schools, the principals of the grammar schools being asked to 
report the names of pupils of whose ability to reach the required standard and pursue 
successfully the high school studies there could be no doubt. Pupils thus designated 
were admitted without examination. For all others that desired to enter, the usual 
examination was held. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For information as to business colleges, private academic schools, schools specially 
engaged in preparing pupils for college, and preparatory departments of universities or 
colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix. For summaries of such sta- 
tistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN AND FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Illinois Industrial University, opened in 1868, is the State University of Illinois. 
It has received from the State large appropriations for fitting up and stocking farms 
and for library, apparatus, and buildings, besides the State’s share of the congressional 
land grant for industrial and scientific education, amounting to 480,000 acres. This 
was supplemented with over $400,000 given by Champaign County to secure the location 
of the university. The university comprises 4 independent colleges, with 10 distinct 
schools, including schools of military science and of art and design. The 4 colleges are of 
agriculture, engineering, natural science, and literature and science. The last includes 
a school of ancient languages and one of English and modern languages, the course in 
each school extending over 4 years and that of ancient languages embracing the usual 
studies of a classical course. The university has permitted from the first as much free- 
dom as possible in the selection of studies. It is required, however, that students be 
thoroughly prepared for the work they undertake and that candidates for a degree pur- 
sue the course prescribed for that degree; also, that each student take at least one study 
relating to industrial science. To meet an urgent demand, temporary provision is made 
for one year of preparatory study. Graduates of accredited high schools are admitted 
without examination. 
Of 30 other recognized colleges and universities, 28 send reports for 1880-81. All but 
6 of these admitted both sexes on equal terms. Three of the 6 referred to were Roman 
Catholic colleges; 1 was non-sectarian; the other 2 were controlled by the Lutheran 
Church. Of the 30 colleges and universities known to be in operation (not including 
the State university), 4 at date of their last report were non-sectarian in their influence; 
the Presbyterian and Methodist churches each claimed 5, the Lutheran 4, the Baptist 
and Roman Catholic each 3, the Christian and United Brethren each 2, and the Evan- 
gelical Association and Universalist Church each 1. 
All but 2 report preparatory departments; all, classical courses of 4 years; 23, general 
scientific courses, which in most cases extended over 4 years; 3 offered separate courses 
for ladies, 2 philosophical, 3 select, and 5 elective courses. Twelve made some provision 
for the training of teachers, either in collegiate or preparatory departments; 18 included 
music, 6 drawing, painting, French, and German in their curriculum; 13 gave business 
training, 10 presented either biblical or theological courses; 4, law; and 1, medical. 
Nine colleges report gifts or bequests received during the year, amounting in all to 
$89,774. Illinois College, Jacksonville, a non-sectarian institution, was offered the largest 
amount ($20,000), provided the college should raise $30,000 additional. Illinois Wes- 
leyan University, Bloomington (Methodist), and Westfield College, Westfield (United 
Brethren), received each $15,000, the former for endowment and enh the latter 
  for general purposes. Lake, Forest University, Lake Forest (Presbyterian), was given 
$10,000 for scholarship and general funds; Augustana College, Rock Island (Evangelical 
Lutheran), $6,000 unconditionally; Lombard University, Galesburg (Universalist), 
$6,500 for endowment and other purpdses; Wheaton College, Wheaton (non-sectarian, 
$559.35 fer current expenses; Monmouth College, Monmouth (United Presbyterian), 
$4,000 for endowment; Northwestern University, Evanston (Methodist Episcopal), $2,715 
for endowment; and Chaddock College, Quincy, $10,000, purpose not specified. 
For full statistics of these institutions, see Table IX of the appendix, and for a sum- 
mary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Besides the opportunities for superior education offered young women in 24 out of 31 
colleges and universities (including the State University), further provision is made in 
12 or more institutions exclusively for them. Light of these were authorized by law to 
confer collegiate degrees, a majority had courses extending over 4 years, and nearly all 
included among the branches taught music, drawing, painting, and modern languages. 
For statistics of these colleges, see Table VIII of the appendix, and for a summary, 
see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 1

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Ilinois Industrial University makes careful provision for scientific training in its 
colleges of agriculture, engineering, and natural science. The aim has been to give the 
college of agriculture the largest development possible, and agricultural students are es- 
pecially invited. The full course in this school extends over 4 years, unites theory and 
practice as much as possible, and embraces among other branches the elements of hus- 
bandry, agricultural engineering and architecture, animal husbandry, veterinary science, 
rural economy, elements of horticulture, landscape gardening, and floriculture. There 
is also a special course for farmers, requiring only a year for completion, in which exclu- 
sive attention is given to the technical agricultural studies. The college of engineering 
comprises schools of mechanical engineering, of architecture, and of civil and mining en- 
gineering; that of natural science, schools of chemistry and naturalhistory. All require 
4 years for completion and lead to the degree of B. Ss. The master’s degrees are given 
on examination after a year of prescribed graduate study or a term of successful prac- 
tice. Labor is furnished as far as possible, that which is not educational being paid for 
at from 8 to 10 cents an hour. 
General scientific courses leading to the degree of B. S. are found, as above noted, in 23 
of the other universities and colleges. In 18 of these institutions the courses aim to be 
equal in value and extent to the classical collegiate; in only 4 cases can the degree be 
gained by 3 years’ study, and in one of these the course is soon to be extended to 4 years. 
For statistics of the scientific colleges of the State University, see Table X of the ap- 
pendix, and for a summary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding; for statistics of scientific courses in colleges, see Table IX. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Of 12 theological seminaries or departments of colleges reporting, 9 present courses ex- 
tending over 3 years at least and in a majority of cases requiring for admission to 
the regular course an examination of all not college graduates. Only 9 report the num- 
ber of students attending, which was 302. Of these 116 had received collegiate degrees. 
Eight reported 68 graduates in 1881 and 4 had 23 resident graduate students. 
The schools requiring three or more years for graduation were Chicago Theological Semi- 
nary (Congregational); Presbyterian Theological Seminary, also at Chicago; Blackburn 
University, Carlinville (Presbyterian); Garrett Biblical Institute, Evanston (Methodist 
Episcopal); Baptist Union Theological Seminary, Morgan Park; theological department 
of Lincoln University, Lincoln (Cumberland Presbyterian); and 2 Lutheran institutions: 
Wartburg Seminary, Mendota, and Concordia College, Springfield. In the theological 
departments of Shurtleff College, Upper Alton (Baptist), and of Augustana College 
(Lutheran), the course was limited to 2 years. Another Lutheran school, the Swedish- 
American Ansgari College, Knoxville, discontinued in 1879 but reorganized in 1880, re- 
ports its course of study not yet fixed. Theological or biblical instruction during the 
college course was given in 4 of the 30 colleges above mentioned, 1 being under the Lu- 
theran, 1 under the Methodist Episcopal, and 2 under the Christian Church. 
The 2 seminaries at Chicago received gifts in funds during the year; that of the Con- 
gregational Church, $36,886, for endowment and general purposes; that of the Presby- 
terian, $3,382.50, most of it for founding a scholarship.— (Returns and catalogues. ) 
For further statistics of theological schools, see Table XI of the appendix, and for a 
summary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal training is given chiefly in the Bloomington Law School, a department of Ilinois 
Wesleyan University, and in the Union College of Law, Chicago, the latter being under 
the joint management of the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. In 
both schools the course of study extends over 2 years of 36 weeks each; neither requires 
an examination for admission, but in the Union College of Law a good common school 
education is expected and a knowledge of Latin advised. The two schools had 137 pu- 
pils in 1880-’81 and graduated 53. McKendree College, Lebanon, also has a department 
of law, with a course of 2 years, in which 11 students were engaged during 1880-’81 and 
3 were graduated. For further statistics of law schools reporting, see Table XII of the 
appendix, and for a summary of it, a corresponding table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
Of 6 medical schools, all at Chicago, 3 were “‘ regular,’’ 1 eclectic, and 2 homeopathic. 
The regular schools are Chicago Medical College (a department of Northwestern Univer- 
sity), the Woman’s Medical College of Chicago, and Rush Medical College. The 2 first 
named require an examination for admission of applicants not graduates of some school 
whose course affords suitable preparation, and at Rush Medical College such an examina- 
tion will be required after 1883. All present the usual 3 years’ medical course, requir- 
ing 3 years of study and attendance on 2 courses of lectures; they also offer and advise

a3 years’ graded course, and in Rush Medical College graduates of that course are 
awarded a certificate of honor in addition to the diploma. Chemical work is obligatory 
in all, and in the Chicago Medical College the study of medical botany is essential to a 
degree. In the 2 of these schools reporting statistics there were 235 students and 62 
graduates in 1881. 
Bennett College of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery, reporting 123 pupilsand 52 graduates, 
and Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital | (homeopathic), with 262 pupils and 101 
graduates, present a 3years’ course of study; intheformer an examination foradmissionis 
required, chemical work is obligatory, and a knowledge of medical botany essential to a 
diploma; in the latter there is no examination for admission; chemical work is obliga- 
tory, but the study of medical botany is not. The Chicago Homeopathic College pre- 
sents a 2 years’ graded course of study, but makes no report of students attending in 
1880-81. Women are admitted to both homeopathic colleges and to Rush Medical 
College, separate provision being made for them in the latter. 
The Chicago College of Pharmacy had 116 students attending and graduated 21. Four 
years’ experience in apothecary work is required for graduation. here, as well as attend- 
ance on 2 lecture courses of 5 months each. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Iilinois Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Jacksonville, admits 
youth 10 to 21 who are proper subjects for its care, and furnishes without charge board, 
tuition, books, and all other necessaries except clothing and travelling expenses, and since 
1875 even these have been supplied to indigent pupils by the counties to which they be- 
long. Pupils are taught the rudiments of an English education, together with such em- 
ploymentsas printing, shoemaking, wood turning, painting, glazing, cabinet work, baking, 
confectionery, and gardening. The institution owns 46 acres of land; it received $85,000 
from the State in 1880-’81, and gave instruction to 578 pupils. 
The Chicago School for Deaf-Mutes, opened by the city board of education in 1875, had 
in 1881 expanded into 5 schools, situated in various portions of the city, in which 55 
pupils were enrolled. Four of them were of elementary grade, and embraced only the 
names of objects, spelling, sentence building, counting, addition, reading, and drawing ; 
an advanced grade, in which were 13 pupils, added grammar, history, andgeography. The 
general assembly in 1881 appropriated $5,000 for the support of these schools, which it 
is said will insure their continuance 2 years longer. 
For further statistics, see Table XVIII of the appendix; and for a summary of it, see 
a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
In the Illinois Institution for the Blind, Jacksonville, blind youths, residents of the 
State, are provided with board, tuition, washing, &c., without cost. The age for admis- 
sion to the school is, as a rule, 10 to 21, but trustees have discretion in all cases, and the 
shop is open 10 all who can learn a trade. Brush and broom making and the caning of 
chairs are taught in the mechanical department; in the literary the course of study 
begins with the alphabet and reaches the higher mathematics. All who show musical 
taste are instructed in vocal and instrumental music. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, Lincoln, organized in 1865, had 374 
children under instruction and training during 1881. Its object as expressed by law is to 
promote the intellectual, moral, and physical culture of this class of children, and to fit 
them, as far as possible, for earning their own livelihood. Pupils from Illinois are sup- 
ported free of charge, the age for admission being 8-18. They are taught reading, 
writing, drawing, object lessons, calisthenics, domestic labor, and painting.— (Catalogue, 
1880, and return, 1881.) 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING... 
The Illinois State Reform School, Pontiac, is for the education and reformation of boys 
committed to it by the courts for some offence against the law. They are taught in 
school 4 hours of the day and kept at work 6. The chief employments are shoemaking 
and cane seating of chairs, but they also do the household, farm, garden, and laundry 
work of the establishment. On the expiration of their sentence the State gives them $5 
and transportation home. No statistics are available for 1881. 
The Illinois Industrial School for Girls, South Evanston, first opened in 1877, receives 
dependent and neglected girls who are committed to it by the State, and trains them in 
household and other industries and in the common school branches. No report for 1881.

The Girls’ Industrial School, Peoria, opened in 1875, a non-sectarian institution sus- 
tained by voluntary contributions, trains about 300 children each year, the age of admis- 
sion being 6 to 15. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
ILLINOIS STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-eighth annual session of the State Teachers’ Association was held at Spring- 
field December 27-29, 1881, the president, E. A. Gastman, of Decatur, inthe chair. No full 
report of proceedings has been received, but the published programme embraced subjects 
of practical interest to teachers. Some of them were to be treated by eminent men and 
experienced educators, such as His Excellency S. M. Cullom, governor of the State; Ben- 
jamin F. Taylor, author and lecturer; Hon. Newton Bateman, president of Knox College, 
and others. 
Governor Cullom’s address of welcome showed that he had given careful attention to 
the educational condition of the State. He expressed his belief in compulsory education, 
saying that when schools are supported by taxation the State has the right and it isits duty 
to enforce the attendance of its children, and that Illinois is behind the most advanced 
States on this question. State Superintendent Slade presented some facts in regard to 
the schools of the State, indicating progress made and work still to be done. 
The weather was favorable for a large gathering, and about four hundred teachers were 
present. A large proportion of the papers were interesting. 
During the session of the association the county superintendents’ section of it held 
three meetings, which were presided over by State Superintendent Slade. Only 20super- 
intendents out of 102 in the State answered to their names at the first meeting, but the 
attendance was somewhat greater at a subsequent meeting. Among the subjects under 
discussion were teachers’ institutes; educational columns in county newspapers; county 
normal schools, their organization, financial support, and course of study; and What can 
county superintendents do to improve the taste for good literature? A resolution was 
passed expressing the sense of the meeting that no certificates should be issued to persons 
under legal age.— (Present Age.) 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
GEORGE A. WILD, B. Ss. 
Mr. Wild, a graduate of the Dlinois Industrial University and afterwards curator of 
the natural history museum, died at Las Animas, Colo., November 12, 1881. Strait- 
ened in his early circumstances he maintained himself while at college largely by teach- 
ing and practising taxidermy. Subsequently he assisted Professor Ward in Rochester 
and then returned to the University, where, as curator of the museum and lecturer, his 
exertions led to the formation of a very complete collection of North American birds. 
Going to Europe to study under Professor Balfour, of Cambridge, and Professor Huxley, 
the latter extended to him an invitation to return as a private student, which his failing 
health prevented him from accepting. On his return from England he went to Colo- 
rado in the hope of restoring his health, which had become impaired through overwork, 
but in this he was unsuccessful, and he died at the age of 27. Throughout his brief but 
useful life he labored assiduously for the improvement of his pupils and won the re- 
sett ae esteem of all with whom he associated.— (From a sketch by James E. Arm-

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the general administration of public school affairs there is a State superintendent 
of public instruction, elected biennially by the people. To aid and counsel him in case 
of need there is a State board of education, of which he is ptesident, the other members 
being the governor, the presidents of the three chief educational institutions of the State, 
and the school superintendents of the three chief cities. 
For local administration each county has a superintendent, chosen biennially by the 
assembled township trustees. To consult with him as to text books, courses of study, 
and other needs of schools there meets semiannually a county board of education, com- 
posed of the township trustees and the chairmen of town and city.school boards in his 
county. In each township into which the county is divided there is a township school 
trustee, chosen biennially by the voters of the township, to locate schools, erect and repair 
school buildings, supply them with furniture and apparatus, and engage for them duly 
licensed teachers. In each incorporated town or city which may form another subdi- 
vision of a county there is a board of school trustees or school commissioners for essen- 
tially the same duties, with reference to whose election, see City School Systems, further 
on. For each public school not in such towns or cities the taxpayers who have asso- 
ciated themselves to sustain and carry on the school elect annually a school director.’ 
Unmarried women assessed for school taxes may vote for school officers at school meet- 
ings. < 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The age for free instruction in the State schools is 6 to 21. The numberof unmarried 
youth of such age isannually ascertained through a census taken by theschool officers, and 
none but those listed in this census as resident or domiciled ina city, town, or township 
are entitled to free school privileges within it for the year, unless by official transfer to it 
afterwards. Gradation of the schools to any required extent is provided for. Separate 
schools for colored youth have been the rule, but where these are not established colored 
children must be allowed to attend the public schools for whites; and where they do exist 
acolored child that can prove a preparation for higher studies than those taught in the 
colored schools must be admitted to such higher grade among the whites. The teaching 
in all public schools must be by persons duly examined and licensed. Teachers are ex- 
pected to improve their qualifications by attending the institutes for this purpose held 
monthly in each township and annually in each county. They must also, at the expira- 
tion of each school term, make to the proper officer a full report of the attendance, 
studies, text books, &c., verifying this by affidavit, or forfeit one-fourth of theirpay. The 
studies prescribed include, besides the ordinary English branches, ‘‘ physiology, his- 
tory of the United States, and good behavior, and such other branches of learning and 
other languages as the advancement of pupils may require and the trustee from time to 
time direct.’’? German is specifically required to be taught when the parents or guard- 
ians of 25 or more children in a public school require it. Provision is made for libraries 
to aid the influences of the schools. Means for maintaining schools come from the in- 
terest on a large common school fund, a State tax of 16 cents on each $100 of taxable 
property, real and personal, and 50 cents on each taxable poll, with the receipts from 
liquor licenses and unclaimed fees (all distributed according to school population), and 
from local taxes, which must not exceed 50 cents on $100 and $1 on each poll, for building, 
furniture, &c., with 25 cents on $100 and $1 on each poll for tuition in townships, or 30 
cents on $100 in incorporated towns. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
For the school year 1880-’81, there is no State report, which in Indiana is made bien- 
nially in the years of even number. School offices also were in many instances filled by 
new incumbents. As has often previously been the case under such circumstances, the 
showing is less favorable than that for the preceding year. Statistics kindly furnished 
by Superintendent Bloss present, indeed, 215 more reporting districts and 217 more in 
which public schools were taught; yet, with 56 more school-houses built, there were on 
the whole 151 fewer reported, but with a higher valuation, amounting to $206,225. 
Reports as to public school attendance, too, are not encouraging. Although a decrease 
in 1879-80 of 4,543 in youth of school age had been more than doubly made up by 
an increase reaching 10,785 in 1880-’81, there was not only no proportionate increase 
of enrolment in the public schools, but a falling off of 7,428, to about the enrolment 
of two yearg before; while average daily attendance, which had advanced 9,516 the 
  
UPhis voluntary association of persons for the support and patronage of an individual school is the only approach to a country school district in this State.

58 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
previous year, ran down 15,358 in this one, reaching a point below that of three preced- 
ing years. The only offset against this diminution in attendance was an increase of 
1,702 pupils in the private schools held in public buildings during the recess of the other 
schools, the daily average attendance in those recess schools about holding its own. In- 
come for schools increased considerably; expenditure as reported seemed to fall off, but in 
reality was $36,904 greater, reckoned on the same basis as in the report of the preceding 
years made to this Bureau for its report of 1880. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The three schools of this class reported at Indianapolis in 1880, with one at Marion, 
are supposed to be in existence in 1881, though not heard from at the date at which this 
goes to press. The one at Franklin was closed in 1880. For such as report for 1881, see 
Table V of the appendix to this report: 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
By a general law the common council of each city must, at its first regular meeting, 
elect three school trustees for terms of 1, 2, and 3 years, and annually thereafter one for 
a3 years’ term, in place of the outgoing one. But when a city has 30,000 or more 
inhabitants the qualified ‘electors of each ward must elect a school commissioner, and 
the commissioners thus elected, after organizing by the election of a president, secretary, 
and treasurer from their own number, must determine by lot which three of their num- 
ber shall hold office for 3 years and which for 2 years, the remainder holding for 1 
year. Thereafter persons elected as school commissioners at the annual elections hold 
for three years each. In either of these cases a superintendent may be employed.

  ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Evansville in 1880-81 had 13 school buildings, with 57 rooms for primary grades, 38 
for grammar, and 10 for high, the sittings in these sufficing for 5,000 children, a little 
more than the enrolment for the year. The schools were taught for 198 of the 200 school 
days in the year, music and German entering into the instruction given and special 
teachers being employed for these. The valuation of public school property is not given, 
nor is the enrolment in other than public schools.— (Return.) 
Fort Wayne had 9 buildings, 8 of them for primary, intermediate, and grammar 
schools, and 1 for high, all affording seats.for 3,788 pupils and valued at $225,150, with 
their sites, furniture, apparatus, and library. A city normal school, with 9 pupils, under 
3 instructors, was apparently housed also in one of these buildings, while in 14 other build- 
ings, with 45 rooms, were seats for 3,100 pupils in private or parochial schools, making 
a total of 6,888 seats for 6,472 enrolled pupils, of whom 4,962 were reported in average 
daily attendance. Music, drawing, and penmanship, under special teachers, continued 
to be taught in the public schools; but, from some cause unexplained, the enrolment in 
these schools was 69 less and the average daily attendance 55 less than in 1879-’80, though 
the youth of school age were 358 more.— (Return. ) 
Indianapolis, with an increase of 2,930 in youth of school age, added in 1880-’81 only 
309 to its public school enrolment and 218 to the enrolment in other schools, while in its 
public school buildings (1 less than in 1879-80 and rated at $72,044 less) there was ac- 
commodation for 915 more. Average daily attendance in these schools was, however,
-P-A-G-E-337
  INDIANA. 59 
better by 140. Increased continuance of attendance, too, was noticeable, observations 
carried through three years showing in that time a growth of 23 per cent. in the number 
13 years of age continuing to attend, of 38 per cent. among those 14 years of age, and 
of 50 per cent. among those 15 years of age. In the high school the number over 
16 had risen from 292 in 1879 to 444 in 1881. In this school the plan of dividing the 
daily sessions has been tried with good results, one-half the pupils coming in the morn- 
ing to recite and going home for further study, and the other half coming in the afternoon. 
A half day session in all the schools during the last two weeks of the school year was 
also tried with manifest advantage. The public library under the care of the school 
board continued to be a great aid to the educational work in the schools, containing for 
the year 31,627 volumes and 3,268 pamphlets of well selected reading matter, and afford- 
ing to 20,338 registered borrowers a total of 206,112 books drawn, besides a large use of 
papers and periodicals by an average of 330 daily visitors of the reading room. Instruc- 
tion in music, drawing, and German, under special teachers, was continued in the 
schools, as was instruction in scientific methods of teaching, in a city normal school; but 
no evening schools appear.— (Report for 1880-81.) 
Jeffersonville.—No information for 1881 has been obtainable from this city up to the 
time at which this matter goes to press. 
La Fayette, in 6 school buildings valued at $168,000, with 44 rooms for study and rec- 
itation and 6 for recitation only, reports for 1881 an enrolment of 2,986 pupils and 
1,610 in average daily attendance. The evening schools occupied 3 rooms. In other 
than public schools there were about 1,200 pupils. In the public schools drawing and 
penmanship were under the charge of special teachers.— (Return. ) 
The schools of Logansport were housed in 7 buildings (1 more than in 1880 and seat- 
ing 115 more pupils), having 30 rooms for study and recitation in primary, grammar, and 
high school grades, and 3 for recitation only, the pupils being 1,198 in the first, 613 in 
the next, and 76 in the high, with an average attendance respectively of 792, 422, and 
57. Pupils in other schools, 790. In the city schools music was taught by a special 
teacher.— (Return. ) 
Madison reports 7 school buildings, rated at $80,500, giving ample accommodation for 
the 1,501 pupils enrolled and 1,284 in average attendance. The reported enrolment in 
private and church schools was less by 250 than in 1879.— (Return. ) 
New Albany.—Nothing from this city has come to hand in time for this report. 
richmond.— This city has also failed to present any report of school statistics for 1881. 
South Bend began 1880-81 with its 7 school buildings put in good condition, the sit- 
tings in them more than doubled since the previous report, and the valuation of them 
raised from $107,000 to $131,350. The high school appears to have been especially bene- 
fited by the alterations made, having had an additional story of its fine building fitted 
up. In all the buildings there were 30 rooms for study and recitation, with 2 for recita- 
tion only, affording in their 2,050 sittings ample room for the 1,924 pupils enrolled and 
more than enough for the 1,259 in average attendance. The schools were classed as 
primary, intermediate, grammar, and high. The course, in which drawing was optional, 
covered 12 years, 4 of them in the high school, where German, taught by a special 
teacher, might be substituted for Latin, no Greek entering into the studies. A good 
reference library for this school was among the improvements of the year. In other than 
public schools 570 pupils were reported.— (Report and return.) 
Terre Haute made some additions to its rooms and teaching force, having 73 more sit- 
tings and 3 more teachers than in 1879-’80, and in its 11 school buildings 69 rooms for 
both study and recitation, with 12 for recitation only. The sittings numbered 3,754, 
somewhat more than sufficing for the average enrolment. There was an average of 
nearly 45 pupils toa teacher. The course covered 12 years or grades, *and promotions 
were made from grade to grade whenever the monthly examinations showed ability to 
take advanced work, though ordinarily these were made at the close of the year on the 
results of all the examinations. Of the former class there were 164; of the latter, 2,856, 
of which 181 were conditional, and 2,675 on an average of 80 per cent. or more of success 
in examination. Classes in German enrolled 772 pupils during the year, of whom 419 
were of German parentage, while 202 of such parentage did not study it in school. Five 
teachers of German were employed, including the principal of the high school, and 1 
teacher of vocal music for all grades. Of the 81 teachers employed 42 had been edu- 
cated in the city high school. 'The teachers met once a month to compare amounts of 
work accomplished and to consider methods of teaching; the principals, twice a month to 
discuss questions of school management and to compare results of plans adopted from 
time to time.— (Report and return.) 
Vincennes, in 4 school buildings, valued at $47,000, with 20 rooms for both study and 
recitation and 2 for recitation only, had 990 sittings for the 1,102 pupils enrolled during 
the year and the 812 in average attendance. The usual division into 12 grades appears, 
with music and German taught by special teachers. In11 schools other than public 550 
pupils were reported.— (Return.)

  60 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The Indiana State Normal School, Terre Haute, opened for instruction in 1870, en- 
deavors to prepare teachers for their work by a thorough review of the branches taught 
in common schools, and careful training in the science and art of teaching. Its courses 
can be completed in from 3 to 9 terms, according to the preparation and capacity of the 
student and the grade for which he wishes to prepare. A revised course is presented in 
the register of 1880-81, giving greater prominence to strictly professional lines of train- 
ing and to the study of the natural sciences, and making some acquaintance with music 
an essential to graduation. The average enrolment was 336 in 1881, against 53 in 1870. 
The number of normal students, exclusive of duplicate enrolments, was for the year 588, 
under whom were 197 pupils in a model training school. Graduates in 1881, 24. ° 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
Three private schools undertake to prepare persons acquainted with elementary English 
studies for teachers’ work in the ordinary schools, granting a teacher’s diploma in 1 
year; for instruction in the higher mathematics, the natural sciences, &c., with the 
degree of bachelor of science, in another year; and for instruction in psychology, logic, 
and such classics as Horace, Livy, Tacitus, A2schylus, and Sophocles, with the degree of 
bachelor of arts, in a third year. These are the Northern Indiana Normal School and 
Business Institute, Valparaiso; Central Normal College and Commercial Institute, Danville; 
and Central Indiana Normal College and Business: Institute, Ladoga; the first named opened 
for instruction in 1873, the other two in 1876. Two others, the Southern Indiana Normat 
School, Paoli, and the Southern Indiana Normat College, Danville—the former opened in 
1875, the latter in 1880 —show in their latest circulars and returns substantially the same 
courses as the three preceding and a disposition to follow the same plan. The North- 
ern Indiana reported for 1880-’81 no less than 2,100 normal pupils; the whole 5 schools 
enrolled 3,006, of whom 235 were graduated, 139 received degrees, and 149 engaged in 
teaching. "Por separate statistics, see Table IIL of the appendix. 
Only 2 city normal schools appear, that of the city of Indianapolis, opened in 1866, 
and the training department of the Fort Wayne public schools, opened in 1867. Both 
take applicants for the position of teacher that have received a high school education or 
its equivalent, and give them instruction in the science of teaching and in methods, with 
practice in a model school under critic teachers; the course at Indianapolis covers one 
year and a half; at Fort Wayne, one year. The former school had 20 pupils in 1880-81; 
the latter, 9, a principal having charge in each case, with critic assistants. 
In several counties summer normal schools were held for several weeks under two 
or more instructors and enrolling fifty to one hundred and fifty pupils; but no full list 
of these schools appears. In Indianapolis a summer school of elocution for training 
teachers in reading and expression was held, and in the same city Dr. William T. Harris, 
late superintendent of schools at St. Louis, delivered a series of lectures on pedagogics, 
repeating these at the State Normal School, Terre Haute, in its spring session and at 
the State University in the autumn. 
Normal courses, sometimes separate from the regular course, sometimes connected with 
it in the spring, appear in the latest catalogues of Bedford College, Bedford; Wabash 
College, Crawfordsville; Fort Wayne College, Fort Wayne; Union Christian College, 
Merom; Moore’s Hill College, Moore’s Hill; Earlham College, Richmond ; Ridgeville 
College, Ridgeville; and Hartsville University, Hartsville. Only 4 of these— Wabash, 
Union Christian, Earlham, and Moore’s Hill—report the students in normal courses in 
1880-81, the totgl i in the 4 being 81. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
These brief normal schools are required by State law to be held at least once a year in 
each county by the county superintendent, and during the sessions of the public schools 
atleast one Saturday of each month in every township, under an instructor designated by 
the township trustee. During the sessions of the former, the county schools are closed 
to enable the teachers to attend the institute ; during those of the latter, the teachers of 
the township must attend or lose a day’s pay for each day’s absence, unless prevented 
from attending by sickness. The State superintendent visited within the year 188081 
the institutes in about 40 counties. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
Further aid in the full training of teachers for their work has been given for many 
years by the Indiana School Journal, Indianapolis, which entered on its twenty-sixth 
volume, January, 1881; and more recently by the Normal Teacher, Danville, and 
School Education, Terre Haute, the former of which was in its third volume, the latter
-P-A-G-E-339

in its second in that year. All contain many articles on methods of teaching and on the 
means of reaching the highest success in government, discipline, and good feeling in the 
schools. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Although in this State the gradation of schools is abundantly provided for, no express 
authority is given for the establishment of high schools. They exist, however, because 
of a popular demand for them, as higher departments of graded schools in the chief 
towns and cities, about 40 appearing in some years in the news notices of the Indiana 
School Journal. Inquiries instituted in 1878 by State Superintendent Smart brought 
out reports from 32, with 78 teachers and 2,784 pupils. Where established the current 
testimony respecting them is that they serve important purposes by preparing the chil- 
dren even of the poorest for the higher grades of work and pay, by training teachers for 
the schools, and by exerting a healthful, stimulating influence on the children in the 
lower classes. All the cities reporting for 1880-’81 indicate the possession of high 
schools, but only 5 give the statistics of teachers, enrolment, and average attendance in 
them, as follows: Fort Wayne, 6, 171, 160; Indianapolis, 14, 640, 512; Logansport, 3, 
76, 57; South Bend, 5, 137, 107; Terre Haute, 6, 248, 198; in all, 34 teachers, 1,272 en- 
rolled pupils, and 1,034 in average attendance daily. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For detailed statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory 
schools of universities and colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix; for 
summaries of the statistics of these several kinds of schools, see corresponding tables in 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Indiana University, Bloomington, admits without examination the graduates of ap- 
proved high schools in the State, women as well as men, on certification by the super- 
intendent of such schools that the candidates have satisfactorily completed the prescribed 
preparatory course of study. This preparatory course does not include Greek. Once en- 
tered, the student has his choice between three collegiate courses, one in ancient classics, 
leading to A. B.; one in modern classics, leading to LIT. B.; and one in science, leading 
to S. B.; each course covers 4 years. 
The other collegiate institutions having full courses of 4 years in 1880-81 were But- 
ler, Hartsville, Indiana Asbury, and Notre Dame Universities and Franklin, Earl- 
ham, Hanover, Moore’s Hill, Ridgeville, Union Christian, and Wabash Colleges. Sta- 
tistics of all these may be found in Table IX. Bedford College, Bedford, long strug- 
gling with pecuniary difficulties, is understood to have been closed in 1881 for want of 
funds. Fort Wayne College was, at the latest advices, only in the beginning of its full 
collegiate work. St. Meinrad’s College presented for 1880-’81 a course that was 
only up to the standard of a fair preparatory school. All save these showed 4 years’ 
scientific or philosophical courses, as well as classical; 3 had English courses, 1 of them 
of 3 years, the other 2 of 4 years; all but 1 had means of instruction in music or elocu- 
tion, 4 in drawing, 3 of these in painting also, 5 in studies preparatory to business, and 
6 in those preparatory to teaching, while all taught modern languages and 2 included 
Hebrew. Notre Dame University had also-a preparatory medical course, and Butler 
University continued to have as one of its departments the Medical College of Indiana. 
Law was taught at Indiana Asbury and at Notre Dame. For detailed statistics of these 
colleges, see Table IX of appendix; for a summary of these statistics, the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The schools especially for this work were, in 1881, the Female College of Indiana, Green- 
-castle (Presbyterian); Moravian Seminary for Young Ladies, Hope; De Pauw College for 
Young Women, New Albany (Methodist Episcopal); and St. Mary’s Academic Institute, 
St. Mary’s (Roman Catholic); the first and third with well defined classical courses of 4 
years, the third having also a scientific course of 3 years; the courses of the others less 
definite, but apparently of fair grade. For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix; for 
a summary of these, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Of the 15 colleges for young men before mentioned, 11 admit women to their advantages, 
so that 15 in all are open to the sex in this State, besides the State scientific school, now 
to be noticed.— (Catalogues and returns. )

REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
4 SCIENTIFIC. 
While Indiana University and 11 of the other colleges afford scientific instruction, Pur- 
due University, La Fayette, continued in 1881 the one school especially devoted to scien- 
tific instruction for this State. This instruction it gave (1) in a college of general science, 
which had scientific, agricultural, and mechanical courses, each of 4 years; (2) in five 
special schools, of agriculture and horticulture, of mechanics, of industrial art, of chem- 
istry, and of natural history, each of 2 or 3 years. Preparation for these courses was 
made in a university academy, with a course of 2 years. A school of mechanical and civil 
engineering was to be organized in 1882. As far ascan be judged from the details given, 
the instruction seems to be eminently practical. Modifications looking to greater effective- 
ness were made within the year.— (Seventh annual register.) 
  PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology in 1881, as previously in this State, continued to be taught mainly as an aux- 
iliary accompaniment of collegiate courses. The exceptions were at Union Christian Col- 
lege, Merom (Christian), and St. Meinrad’s College, St. Meinrad’s (Roman Catholic). 
In these there were special separate departments for theological study, each with a course 
of 3 years; that in the former uniting some higher school studies with Scripture reading 
and interpretation, rational and systematic theology, church history, &c.; that in the 
latter following a comparatively low collegiate course and embracing essentially the same 
subjects, with canon law. The other schools with some instruction designed to prepare 
partially for ministerial work were the biblical department of Butler University, Inving- 
ton (Christian), the ministerial department of Indiana Asbury University, Greencastle 
(Methodist Episcopal), and probably the Hebrew departments of Moore’s Hill College, 
Moore’s Hill (Methodist Episcopal), and of Notre Dame University, Notre Dame (Ro- 
man Catholic). The theological training for which Concordia College, Fort Wayne 
(Evangelical Lutheran), is meant to prepare is not given in Indiana, but in a Practical 
Preachers’ Seminary, Springfield, Ilinois, or at the Evangelical Lutheran Preachers? 
Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri. The 4 years’ ministerial course at Bedford College, Bed- 
ford (Christian), is believed to have been suspended in 1881 with the other work of the 
college.— (Catalogues and returns.) 
For any reported statistics of theological schools, see Table XI of the appendix. 
Law was still taught by 6 professors in a 2 years’ course at Notre Dame University, 
Notre Dame, a good English education being required for admission and classical train- 
ing earnestly recommended, the opportunity for it being offered in the university during 
the lawcourse. Therewere 60 students in1880~’81. Indiana Asbury University, Green- 
castle, in the autumn of 1881 organized a department of law with 5 professors and a 
course of 2 years, enrolling 12 students for the first year. A law course of 2 years also ex- 
isted at the Northern Indiana Normal School, Valparaiso. See also Table XII of the 
appendix. 
Medicine, after the ‘‘regular’’ form and according to the standard of the American 
Medical College Association,’ was taught by the Medical College of Evansville, the Med- 
ical College of Fort Wayne,? the Medical College of Indiana, Indianapolis (a department 
of Butler University, Irvington), and the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons, also 
atIndianapolis. The Medical College of Fort Wayne and the Central College wenta little 
beyond the requirement of the American Association, each offering and recommending 
a 3 years’ graded course, in place of the regular one of 2 years. Courses preparatory to 
regular medical study were advertised for 1880-81 in the Central Normal College, Dan- 
ville; Northern Indiana Normal School, Valparaiso, and Notre Dame University, Notre 
Dame. 
Besides the above, there was at Indianapolis instruction after the eclectic form in the 
Indiana Eclectic Medical College, the full course in which is not distinctly shown in any 
report or return to this Bureau, and the status of which is in some doubt from the fact 
that a committee of the National Eclectic Medical Association in the summer of 1881 
recommended that its recognition be deferred, and that this recognition was at last given 
against at least one strong protest. 
Dentistry received attention in the Indiana Dental College, Indianapolis, which required 
a preceding pupilage of 2 years under a competent practitioner, evidence of a good com- 
mon school education, an attendance on 2 lecture courses of 5 months each, and the passing 
of a satisfactory final examination. Women are admitted. 
1This requires three years of study under a regular preceptor, attendance on two full lecture 
courses of not less than twenty weelss each in the seven principal branches of medicine and surgery, and the passage of a personal examination on all these before the faculty, with evidence of good 
moral character and full age. 2 Not to be confounded with the Fort Wayne College of Medicine, another institution in the same 
place Seo was refused admission to the American Medical College Association in 1880 on moral 
grounds.

. SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Indiana Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Indianapolis, reports 
for the year ending October 31, 1881, instruction in the manual alphabet and signs, as 
well as in the printed and written alphabets, with a fair course in common school branches, 
in scriptural studies, and in such industries as cabinet and shoe making and chair caning. 
Articulation was taught. For the benefit of pupils wishing to qualify themselves for 
teaching, a high class, with 3 years’ study in the sciences following the 7 primary years, 
had been organized. The number of teachers for the year was 18, of whom were 6 semi- 
mutes; number of pupils.405, of whom 61 were either graduated, dismissed, or otherwise 
disposed of, ae 344; total number since the foundation of the school, 1,395.— (Report 
and return. 
  EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
In the Indiana Institution for the Education of the Blind, Indianapolis, were 10 in- 
structors, 4 other officers, and 15 employés for 1880-’81, with 127 pupils during the year, 
of whom 119 were present at the close. The usual-occupations to fit the blind for self 
support were taught, as well as the elementary common school studies and some of high 
pe, meee for teaching. Pupils trained since the foundation of the school, 672.— 
eturn. ee 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, under the direction of the State, at Knights- 
town, had for 1880-’81 a total of 89 such children on its roll at the opening of the 
spring term, of whom 1 was transferred to the adjoining home for soldiers’ orphans and 6 
returned to friends before the conclusion of the year, leaving 82 under 8 teachers. Ofthe 
whole number, 50 boys and 27 girls were engaged during the year in three grades of school 
studies under 4 teachers, the studies ranging from articulation, colors, form drawing, and 
counting, up to reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, &c. When notin school the chil- 
dren were under the constant care of other attendants, by some of whom, under the super- 
vision of a matron, they were instructed in useful industries. Moral training was also 
provided for.— (Report and return. ) 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
The Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home, Knightstown, connected with theasylum just mentioned, 
enrolled for the same year 170 children, of whom 13 were taken by friends, 17 provided 
with homes, and 8 failed to report, leaving 132. These were instructed in the ordinary 
English branches of study, beginning with Kindergarten work and reaching to United 
States history, with such industries as were appropriate to their sex and age.— (Report 
and return.) 
The only other home orschool for orphans reported was one at Jeffersonville called the 
Orphans’ Home, which appears to have had a new building erected for it in 1880-’81 and 
to have enrolled 34 children, 4 of whom were provided with homes during the year and 
1 sent to the State Reformatory, leaving 29. Some ‘‘training”’ is referred to in the re- 
port received, but whether in school studies or industries is not indicated. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The reformatory department of the Indiana Reformatory Institution for Women and Girls, 
Indianapolis, which in 1879-’80 reported 140 pupils in its school under training in useful 
industries and in common school studies, makes return for 1880~’81 of 115 under training 
in general household duties, sewing, knitting, laundry work, and cane seating. 
The Indiana House of Refuge for Juvenile Offenders, Plainfield, which cares for boys, as 
the other does for girls, had, according to a return, 356 inmates in 188081, of whom 157 
were received during the year and 167 discharged. The training while in the institution 
was in common school studies, farming, gardening, baking, tailoring, shoemaking, and 
chair making. A large number of the boys have not been committed to the house be- 
cause of crime or fault, but simply from lack of guardianship. 
HOMES FOR TRAINING PAUPEB CHILDREN. 
With a view to protect from evil association the children often consigned to the poor- 
houses in the several counties, a number of benevolent ladies have secured from the civil 
authorities permission to gather such children into county homes in order more effectively 
to train them in useful industries, in connection with school studies, and to bring them

under good matronly and family influences. Threesuch homes had been putin operation 
up to November, 1881, with fair prospects of successful working, and more were contem- 
plated. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
  STATE CONVENTION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The session of this body for 1881 was held June 28 in the hall of the high school, 
Indianapolis, 54 superintendents being present. The first thing considered, after a brief 
inaugural address, was a proposition from the trustees of the State University that an 
effort be set on foot to unify more fully the school system (1) by grading the district 
and town elementary schools and graduating pupils from them into the high schools 
of each county; (2) by arranging, for high schools not at present commissioned to send 
their pupils to the university, such a system of examinations as might secure a home de- 
termination of their qualifications for admission to the freshm&’n class. It was thought 
by the trustees and urged on the association that such a system of gradation and promo- 
tion wisely conducted would give an additional and important link of connection be- 
tween the State schools and the university, and would encourage a more extensive prep- 
aration for the higher forms of education. The suggestions made are said to have met 
with cordial welcome, but it was thought wisest to postpone till the next meeting any 
decisive action on the plan, except as respected a uniform course of study consisting of 5 
grades, for county common schools, which was arranged for. 
The subject of school visitation was next presented and discussed, all agreeing as to its 
importance as a means of stimulating and improving teachers and raising the standard of 
the schools, but many differing widely as to the length of an effective visitation, the 
frequency with which itshould be repeated, and the question whether preliminary notice 
of it should or should not be given. 
As to the time of holding township institutes there appears to have been a difference also, 
but a plan and manual for county institute work, presented by State Superintendent 
Bloss and recommended by Ex-Superintendent Smart and others, was heartily welcomed 
and resolutions advocating its use were passed.— (Indiana School Journal, July, 1881.) 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-eighth annual convention of the teachers of the State was held in the hall 
of the board of trade, Indianapolis, December 27-29, 1881, Mr. H. B. Jacobs, superin- 
tendent of schools of New Albany, presiding. Governor Porter delivered an impressive 
address of welcome, fully acknowledging the influence that trained teachers have come 
to exercise and suggesting means by which that influence may be increased. The presi- 
dent dwelt on the progress made in school systems, schools, and teaching within 20 years, 
but said that, while Gail Hamiltons and Grant Whites could still find so much to criti- 
cise, it must not be supposed that perfection had been reached or that reforms at some 
points were not needed. Superintendent T. J. Charlton, of the State Reform School, 
Plainfield, read an interesting paper on the ‘‘ Management of bad boys,” in which he 
dwelt on the need of judicious compulsion to secure education for all children as one 
great preventive of wrong doing, and on the further need of a reformatory training, firm, 
mild, and kind, to bring back to right paths youth who have gone astray. J. Warren 
McBrown, superintendent of the schools of Covington, admitting all this, said that one 
thing more must be added, that is, such a power of personality as would not only win 
children to the school, but also command them and control them there. Subsequently 
the teaching of temperance was urged by Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, of Boston, and to some 
extent seconded by Mr. L. H. Jones, of the Indianapolis Normal School, on the ground 
that as a question of morals and of health it merited specific introduction as much as 
physiology and as far as there might be time for it. The qualifications of teachers next 
came up for review, and here the need not only of a thorough training, but of a practi- 
cal one, including the science and art of teaching, with practice in a model school, was 
discussed by State Commissioner De Wolf, of Ohio, Professor Mickleborough, of the Cin- 
cinnati High School, and others. Professor W. R. Houghton, of the State University, 
then read a paper on ‘‘ The unification of the public school system,” containing substan- 
tially the ideas presented at the superintendents’ convention. A minute of respect for 
the late Dr. William D. Henkle, of Ohio, and of high estimate of his educational ser- 
vices in Indiana was then read and adopted, after which Miss A. K. Huron presented 
@ paper on ‘‘ The relation of school and home,”’ in which were these pregnant sentences: 
“He serves the future best who best cares for the present of the children. The lives of 
the children of to-day will be'what the homes and the schools of to-day make them. 
The authority of the home and the school disregarded, the rights of society and the laws 
of the country are defied. Homes teeming with ignorance and vice are the origin of 
most of the great crimes that crowd the columns of the daily papers. The relation of 
the school to such homes must be that of reformer. Not less of books, but more of ques- 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
INDIANA. ~ 65 
tions of every day living, of general culture, of right motives for action, should be taught. 
Only truly happy homes can result in good citizens.”’ 
Resolutions against political and sectarian influences in the common schools and in 
favor of making merit only the test of fitness for position in these schools were then 
passed, with others calling for the fullest training possible for every teacher, and for 
instruction of the pupils in the bad effects of opium, alcohol, and tobacco on the system. 
The session then closed. 
SOUTHERN INDIANA TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This offshoot from the State Teachers’ Association, at its fourth meeting, March 16-18, 
at Lawrenceburg, discussed such topics as ‘‘ The defects of our common schools and the 
necessary remedies;’’ ‘‘ Improvement in the course of studies in the public schools,” a 
plea for unifying the classification, grading, courses, text books, and aims of all through- 
out the State; ‘‘ Authors’’ as a side study, especially on the birthdays of those most wor- 
thy of attention; ‘‘ Nearsightedness,’’ and ‘‘Tact.’’ Space for full report is wanting. 
INDIANA COLLEGE ASSOCIATION. 
At the fourth annual meeting, held in Indianapolis December 26 and 27, 1881, the first 
business presented was a question whether the State College Oratorical Association could 
not be induced to hold its annual exercises at a time that would not break in on the 
regular work of the colleges. Referred to a committee, a report was made in favor of a 
change which would bring the annual meeting and contest into the Christmas holidays 
and make it coincident with the meetings of the College Association and State Teachers’ 
Association, The meeting, proceeding with its general programme, took up and discussed 
“Methods of science,’’ in respect to which inductive methods, with careful observation 
of natural objects, and microscopical and laboratory work, with but slight use of text books, 
were generally urged. The means of improving the colleges of Indiana as to their moral 
atmosphere, their curricula of study, their modes of teaching, and the subsequent rela- 
tion of graduates to their alma mater next came up, and then ‘‘ Codrdination of college 
studies.”’ As to this last, it was urged that high schools should not ape collegiate aims, 
that colleges should not try to be universities, that studies should be selected which 
combine information and mental drill and tend to cultivate all the faculties, that for 
students looking to professions there should be studies looking towards these, and that 
the number of studies should not be too great. An excellent tentative programme of a 
combined classical, scientific, and philosophical course was presented. Then came ‘‘Col- 
lege ethics,’ which was largely and practically discussed; then ‘‘The college and the 
commonwealth;’’ and then election of officers and adjournment.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The general supervision of public schools is intrusted to a State superintendent, elected 
‘by the people in each odd-numbered year.!   
1 For the State University there isa board of 15 regents; for the State Normal School, a board of 
6directors. Both boards are chosen by the legislature, except 3 ex officio members of the board of 
regents. There are also boards of trustees of a State college for the blind, a State institution for 
deaf-mutes, a State reform school, and one for the feeble-minded.  
-P-A-G-E-345
IOWA. 67 
Local supervision is carried on by a county superintendent of schools for each county, 
a board of directors for each township and each independent district into which a town- 
ship may be divided, and a subdirector for each subdistrict into which a township may 
be cut up, these subdirectors together forming a township board for the management of 
school funds. 
By a law of 1876 women are eligible to any school office, and from 1882 one woman is 
to be a member of a State board of examiners, which begins its work in that year. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
District, subdistrict, graded, and high schools, a State normal school, normal institutes, 
a State university, reform schools, institutions for the blind, the deaf and dumb, and the 
feeble-minded, are included in the State school system. The ordinary schools are free 
to all of school age resident in the district in which they are held.1 Schools must be 
taught in each subdistrict for at least 120 days in each year. During the sessions of the 
normal institutes held annually in each county the schools are generally closed. All 
who design to teach are expected but are not required to attend these institutes, and, to 
be legally employed, must receive certificates of qualification. They must keep a daily 
register and report at the close of the school year to the secretary of the local board, he to 
the county superintendent, and he to the State superintendent. The Bible must not 
be excluded from any school, nor must any pupil be required to read it if forbidden by 
parents or guardians. Pauper children in almshouses receive a special appropriation for 
their instruction in the adjacent schools. 
Public schools are sustained from the income of a State school fund; by county taxes 
of 1 to 3 mills on $1; and by district taxes, which may not in ordinary districts exceed 
10 mills on $1 for a school-house fund and $5 a pupil for a contingent fund ; the amount 
raised for the teachers’ fund, including the semiannual apportionment, shall not exceed 
$15 a pupil.? 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
An increase of 8,174 in youth of school age was more than met by an increased enrolment 
of 5,456 in public schools and of 2,374 in private schools, yet in average attendance on the 
public schools there was a falling off of 5,748, being a decrease of 2.1 percent. Of district 
townships there was 1 less than in 1879-80, with 14 fewer independent districts, while 
in subdistricts there was a gain of 140, in public graded schools of 5, and in ungraded 
schools of 151. School-houses were 184 more in number, with an increase in value of school 
property of $290,250. While there were 708 fewer male teachers there were 886 more female, 
being in all a gain of 178, the monthly pay of men increasing $1.34 and that of women 
97 cents. Private schools numbered 8 more, the teachers in them 48 more, and the 
pupils 2,374 more. The State school fund gained $62,713. The superintendent reported 
an encouraging improvement in the school work. Some greater permanency in engage- 
ments with teachers is perceived, and the suggestion is made that practical industrial 
education be connected with drawing in the schools and be aided by summer schools for 
specific industrial instruction. The problem of compulsory education was mentioned, 
and the conviction expressed that in some of the larger cities separate schools for truants 
and vagrants should be established, to combine educational and reformatory training.—

KINDERGARTEN. 
Of 3Kindergiirten reported in1879-’80 at Boone, Cedar Rapids, and Des Moines, only the 
last has reported for 1880-’81 at the time at which this goes topress. In this there were 
2 assistants, the conductor, and 30 children from 4 to 7 years of age, attending 3 hours 
daily. The training was in elementary studies, sewing, drawing, slat work, and mod- 
elling, with the folding, cutting, pasting, weaving, and interweaving of paper strips, &e. 
In the State school report 3 other Kindergiirten are noticed: 1 at Council Bluffs, with a 
principal, statistics of attendance not given; 1 at Dubuque, with 2 teachers and 20 pupils; 
and 1 at Manchester, with a single teacher and 60 pupils.— (Report. )

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
By a general law these, except in specially chartered cities, consist of boards of di- 
rectors of 6 members, elected by the people for terms of 3 years, 2 to be changed each 
year. The directors elect a president from their own number, but the secretary and treas- 
urer must be chosen from outside. Superintendents are appointed by the city board.   
1Ghildren residing in one district may attend school in another on such terms as may be agreed on by the respective boards of said districts. 2 Independent districts may levy a tax not to exceed 10 mills on $1 for grounds and buildings for 
their schools, for the payment of debts contracted in erecting such buildings, and for procuring a library and apparatus for the schools,

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Schools of all the following cities were classed in 1880-’81 as primary, grammar, and 
high, except those of Muscatine, which had in addition an intermediate division between 
the primary and grammar. Davenport had a normal department connected with its high 
school. 
Burlington had 12 public schools in session 10 months; employed 3 male teachers, at an 
average monthly salary of $100, and 56 female teachers, at an average of $40.09. 
Cedar Rapids, for its school population of 3,366, had 8 school buildings, with 2 rooms 
for recitation, 25 for its primary schools, 10 for its grammar, and 1 for its high school; 
these afforded 1,869 sittings for study; value of school property, $98,000. The 38 teachers 
employed were all females. On an enrolment of 2,146 there was an average daily attend- 
ance of 84 per cent. during a session of 179 days. No special instruction appears to have 
been given. A private school enrolled 150 pupils.— (Return. ) 
Clinton employed for its public schools 30 female teachers, at an average monthly 
salary of $45, and 1 male teacher, at $50. Schools were in session 9} months and enrolled 
54 per cent. of the school popuiation; 66 per cent. of those enrolled were in average daily 
attendance. One special teacher in penmanship was employed. The attendance suffered 
from the prevalence of epidemics. Of the 40 pupils who usually enter the high school 
each year nearly one-third finished the full course of 4 years.— (‘Tenth annual report. ) 
Council Blufs.—The 10 school buildings reported in 1878~’79 appear to have given 
place to 3 larger ones reported in 1880-’81 (among them one erected during the year, at 
a cost of $35,000). The school property was valued at $141,300, an increase of $21,300. 
These 3 buildings furnished 29 rooms for the primary schools, 9 for the grammar, and 1 
for the high school, having 1,535 sittings, besides 2 rooms for recitation. There were 6 
different schools in session for 195 days, taught by 2 male and 39 female teachers. A 
Kindergarten, with 70 pupils under 6 years of age, was opened during the year and added 
to the public schools. The principal was paid $600 a year and her assistant $250. En- 
rolment in private and parochial schools, 301.— (State report and return. ) 
Davenport had for its 11 different schools 13 buildings, containing 83 rooms, of which 
45 were for the primary, 21 for the grammar, 3 for the high, and 1 for the normal school, 
while 13 were for recitation only. Of the 76 teachers 69 were females. There were 
also 10 special teachers of German employed, at salaries of from $400 to $650 a year. Spe- 
cial teachers in drawing and penmanship were also employed, at salaries of $800 each. 
Two evening schools, with an enrolment of 222, had 106 in average daily attendance. 
The day schools were in session 188 days. School property was valued at $291,200. No 
private schools reported.— (State report and return.) 
Dubuque, for its school population of 10,074, had 8 public schools and 9 buildings, 
with 74 rooms, and school property valued at $165,000. The schools enrolled 3,720, 
68.95 per cent. of them being in average daily attendance. Of the'71 teachers employed 
61 were females and were paid annual salaries of from $250 to $500, while those of men 
were from $600 to $1,800. Special teachers of German (which was an optional study in 
certain grades) were employed. Schools were taught 198 days. No private schools 
reported.— (State report and return.) 
East Des Moines reported to the State superintendent.7 public schools, with 24 female 
teachers, whose average monthly pay was $47.45. Length of session, 9 months. Latin 
and German were taught in the high school.— (State report.) 
Keokuk, tor its school population of 4,585, had 8 different public schools, with 2,200 
sittings, and school property valued at $150,000. The schools enrolled 2,400, and had 
78.9 per cent. of these in average daily attendance. There were 45 female teachers,  
-P-A-G-E-347
IOWA. 69 
whose monthly salaries averaged $37.39. Schools were taught 190 days. There was 1 
evening school, but no statistics of teachers or attendance in it are given. Special in- 
struction was given in music and penmanship. In private and parochial schools 400 were 
enrolled.— (State report and return.) 
Muscatine had 7 school buildings, affording 23 rooms, with 1,550 sittings, and school 
property valued at $80,800. Schools were taught 210 days, with an average daily attend- 
ance of 93.3 per cent. on enrolment. Of the 34 teachers 30 were females and were paid 
an average monthly salary of $35, while the male teachers in the higher grades were paid 
$60. The high school had convenient rooms and apparatus for instruction in physics, 
chemistry, astronomy, botany, and natural history, with 2 courses of 3 and 4 years each. 
Estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools, 400.— (Return. ) 
Ottumwa had for its public schools 3 buildings, with 24 rooms and 1,490 sittings, 960 of 
which were for the primary grades, 440 for the grammar, and 90 for the high school; value 
of school property, $52,200. Besides a principal, the schools were taught by 26 female 
teachers, at an average monthly salary of $44; there was an average daily attendance of 
65.6 per cent. on the enrolment. Theschools were in session 189 days. A special teacher 
of ae was employed, at a yearly salary of $600. Private schools enrolled 120.— (Re- 
turn. 
West Des Moines reported to the State superintendent 6 school buildings, with 42 female 
teachers, whose monthly salaries were $74 in the high school and $60 in the other schools. 
All were ‘in session for 190 days. Latin and German were taught in the high school.— 
(State report.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL AND STATE UNIVERSITY NORMAL DEPARTMENT. 
The Iowa State Normal School, Cedar Falls, though overflowing with students, was in 
1880-’81 still deficient in conveniences for boarding, in number of instructors, and amount 
and quality of apparatus. It had 3 courses of study, arranged with special reference to 
fitting teachers for their work. The elementary course of 2 years was meant to qualify 
teachers: for work in all grades up to the high schools; the didactic, of 3 years, for 
high school work; the scientific, of 4 years, to train superintendents, principals of high 
schools, academies, &c. Students completing the élementary or didactic course, and 
passing a satisfactory examination, received certificates as to the amount of study they 
had done and proficiency attained, while those graduating in the scientific course re- 
ceived diplomas with the degree of bachelor of didactics. Examinations for gradu- 
ation required a thesis on some educational subject. Boys on admission must be at least 
17 and girls at least 16 years old, must sign a statement of their intention to teach in the 
public schools of the State, and, if applicants for the lower course, must produce a teach- 
ers’ certificate of the lower grade, signed in each case by the superintendent of the 
county where the applicant resides. There were 344 in attendance during the year, rep- 
resenting 71 counties. Of the 36 graduates 33 engaged in teaching.— (State report, cat- 
alogue, and return.) 
The chair of didactics in the State wniversity, Iowa City, is designed to prepare for 
advanced school work those students who intend to become teachers. The fall term of 
the senior year is devoted to instruction in school management and the government and 
organization of ungraded schools; the winter term, to methods of organizing, supervising, 
and conducting graded schools; the spring term, to principles and methods of instruction. 
A brief course of lectures is also given, and the class is drilled in careful reading one or 
two days a week. Only those who complete the full course can receive certificates of 
qualification. After 2 years of successful teaching graduates may receive the degree of 
bachelor of didactics.— (Catalogue. ) 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
The Eastern Iowa Normal School, formerly at Grandview, now at Columbus Junction, 
has 2 normal courses: first, an elementary one of 2 years, to fit for ordinary teaching in 
public or other schools; second, an advanced normal one of 4 years, to prepare for higher 
grades of school work. A model school reported last year seems to have been abandoned 
or withdrawn. There were enrolled in 1880-81 as normal students 48 males and 45 
females, 11 of whom graduated and engaged in teaching. A normal institute, lasting 
4 weeks, affords those who wish to review the common branches an opportunity to pre- 
pare & the spring examinations by the county superintendent.— (Catalogue and re- 
turn. 
Southern Iowa Normal School and Commercial Institute, Bloomington, has a normal course 
of 1 year to review the branches taught in the common schools and to acquaint students 
with the latest and most approved methods of teaching and school organization. For 
those who desire more thorough training this course is supplemented by a scientific one of

2 years and a classical of 1 year. The State report for 188081 gives 4 teachers and 125 
students.— (State report.) 
Amity College, College Springs; Tabor College, Tabor; Iowa Wesleyan University, 
Mount Pleasant, all had in 1880-81 normal courses of 2 years. Whittier College, 
Salem; Iowa College, Grinnell; and Teachers’ Seminary, Waverly, had such courses of 3 
years; while Cornell College and Mount Vernon had 2 years’ preparatory and 2 years’ col- 
legiate normal courses; Penn College, Oskaloosa, also had a 4 years’ normal course; Par- 
sons College, Fairfield, gives didactic instruction throughout a course of 4 years; Central 
University, Pella, did the same through its preparatory course; while at the High 
School, Davenport, normal instruction was given throughout its entire course. Iowa 
City Academy, reported in 1879-80 with a normal course of 4 years, sends no return for 
1880-81, nor is there any information from the Moulton Normal School, mentioned in 
the same report.— (Catalogues and returns. ) 
There appear in the State report for 1881 the following also: Peck’s Normal School, 
Ottumwa; Western Normal and Business Institute, Malvern; Hull’s Preparatory and 
Normal School, Iowa City; Kossuth Normal Academy, Kossuth; Garden Grove Normal 
School, Garden Grove; Dexter Normal School, Dexter. Statistics indicate that there were 
18 teachers and 399 pupils in these schools, but the strictly normal pupils are not dis- 
tinguished from the others.— (State report, 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. : 
The normal institutes required by law to be held in each county afford the majority of 
eountry teachers the only professional training within theirreach. They were sustained 
with enthusiasm in 1880-’81 in all the 99 counties in the State, except Buena Vista. The 
average session was about 3 weeks, with a total attendance of 11,381 teachers (of whom 
2,389 were males and 8,992 females), and they cost $50,957. 
Since 1874 there has been a regular course held at these institutes, covering not merely 
the principal studies, but also modes of instruction in such studies, with school discipline 
and organization.— (State report.) i 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The educational journals in the State were in 1881, as before, the Iowa Normal 
Monthly, published at Dubuque as the official organ of the State superintendent, and the 
Central School Journal, published monthly at Keokuk, under the auspices of the county 
superintendents of Southeastern Iowa. Both have done good service. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The following cities report high schools in 1880-81: Burlington, Cedar Rapids, Council 
Bluffs, Davenport, Dubuque, East Des Moines, West Des Moines, Keokuk, Muscatine, 
and Ottumwa. The existence of public high schools in at least 29 other cities or towns 
is noted from time to time in the ‘‘State news and notes’? of the Iowa Normal Monthly 
of 1880 and 1881. 
Guthrie County High School, Panora (among those referred to above), is the only county 
high school yet established in the State in accordance with the law of 1870, which provides 
that any county having 2,000 population or over may establish a high school and vote 
taxes not exceeding 5 mills on $1 of taxable property for all purposes or 2 mills for teach- 
ers’ wages and contingencies. It had in 1880~’81 3 teachers and 75 students.— (State 
report and return. ) 
For an account of the high school oratorical contest of 1881, see Educational Conven- 
tions and Associations following. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix, and the summaries 
of them in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES, 
The State University of Iowa had in 1880-’81, as in 1879-80, a collegiate course, em- 
bracing classical, philosophical, scientific, and engineering courses of 4 years each ; also, 
alaw department and 2 medical departments, regular and homeopathic; a school of 
dentistry was to be organized in 1882. The university does no preparatory work, but 
looks to the high and other preparatory schools to do this, and admits the graduates of 
approved schools without examination. The whole enrolment in 1880-’81 was 242 in 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  IOWA. 71 
the collegiate department, 158 in the law, and 197 in the 2 medical departments.— 
(Catalogue. ) j 
There were 18 other colleges and universities reported in 1880-81, one (Humboldt) 
having suspended during the year. Of these, Parsons College had a preparatory course 
of 3 years, and Griswold College one of 4 years. Amity, Norwegian Luther, Iowa, Ger- 
man, Penn, Whittier, Cornell, Tabor, and Western Colleges, University of Des Moines, 
Iowa Wesleyan University, Upper Iowa University, and State University of Iowa had 
preparatory courses of 2 years, while all had classical courses of 4 years and scientific of 
the same length, with the exception of Amity, which had 2 years’ scientific, and Gris- 
wold College, Whittier College, and Central University, which each had one of 3 years. 
Towa, Oskaloosa, and the University of Des Moines had special ladies’ courses of 3 and 4 
years, with commercial training; while Penn College and Iowa Wesleyan and Central 
Universities offered special English courses of 2 and 3 years, and Tabor a literary course 
of 4 years. All but 4 of the above mentioned institutions had normal courses of 1 
to 4 years, while 13 had courses of music and 4 taught painting and drawing. Iowa 
Wesleyan offered theological, law, and medical courses, eating one of pharmacy, but not 
clearly indicating the length or amount of study of any of them. St. Joseph College 
presented a preparatory course covering only elementary studies, while the first 3 years 
of its classical course were only fairly preparatory with 1 really collegiate beyond, adding 
@ commercial one of 2 years. Burlington College makes no showing since 1878-79, 
when it reported only a preparatory course. Negotiations were in progress for remov- 
ing Oskaloosa College to Des Moines, to be called Drake University. Cornell, with its 4 
full classical, philosophical, scientific, and civil engineering courses, offered also a wide 
range of elective studies and special advantages in its normal, musical, and commercial 
departments. A new Presbyterian college formed from the Coe Collegiate Institute was 
about to be opened.— (Catalogues. ) 
For statistics of all these, see Table IX of the appendix; for a summary of their statis- 
tics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
All the colleges and universities above mentioned, including the State University, admit 
young women to the same privileges offered young men, except Griswold, Norwegian 
Luther, and St. Joseph Colleges, the principal object of at least the last two seeming to 
be to train young men for the ministry. For statistics of the institutions designed spe- 
cially for the education of young women, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a sum- 
mary of their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
For scientific instruction for industrial pursuits the Jowa Agricultural College, Ames, 
is the chief institution. The courses of study are general and technical. Under the first 
is a course in sciences related to industries, which aims to give a liberal culture in these 
* without special reference to any pursuit or profession; while the technical courses, giving 
also a liberal culture, aim to direct it so as to meet the requirements of some special pur- 
suit. These latter are in agriculture and in mechanical and civil engineering, each re- 
quiring 4 years, and a course in veterinary science of 2 years. The courses are arranged in 
schools having special instructors. By certain additional studies to the course in sciences - 
related to industries it is adapted to the wants of both sexes, giving to young women 
work and instruction in domestic economy and to young men practical lessons in agri- 
culture and horticulture. Military instruction and drill enter into the arrangements for 
youngmen. There were 211 collegiate students in 1880-81, 3 of them resident graduates, 
3 special students, and 4 in the veterinary school. The graduates from 1872 to 1881 num- 
bered 182.— (Catalogue. ) 
The school of science in the State University offered a general scientific course and one 
in civil engineering, each of 4 years; the latter includes drawing, surveying, and me- 
chanics (pure and applied), using the metric system throughout; also, a course in military 
science and tactics. Cornell College, too, had a general course in science and one in civil 
engineering, each of 4 years. Thirteen other colleges presented general scientific courses 
of 2 to 4 years.— (Catalogues. ) 
For statistics, see Table X of the appendix, and summary of this in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology in full 3 years’ courses is presented in the theological departments of Griswold 
College, Davenport (Protestant Episcopal), and of the German College, at Mt. Pleasant 
Methodist Episcopal); less fully and systematically in the 2 and 3 years’ courses of 
kaloosa College (Christian), and to some extent, as an adjunct to the collegiate train-

12 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ing, in the Iowa Wesleyan University, Mt. Pleasant (Methodist Episcopal), and the Cen- 
tral University of Iowa, Pella (Baptist). The first and second have preliminary examina- 
tion of students entering who are not either graduates of colleges or from their prepara- 
tory training schools. 
Law is taught in the law department of the Iowa State University, Iowa City, and in 
the Iowa Wesleyan University, Mt. Pleasant, though in the latter its course is entirely 
unspecified. In the State University (which alone requires preliminary evidence of even 
an English education), while only 1 year is demanded for graduation, an advanced course 
of another year is offered. The final examination is conducted by a board of examiners 
appointed by the supreme court of the State. The Iowa College of Law, connected with 
the Simpson Centenary College, Indianola, reported in 1878~’79, seems to have been 
dropped, as no notice of it appears in 1879-80 and 1880~’81. 
Medicine, according to the ‘‘regular ”’ practice, was taught in the College of Physicians 
and ‘Surgeons of Keokuk and the medical department of the Iowa State University, 
Towa City, and according to the homeopathic form in the homeopathic branch of the 
same medical department. In each the requirement was 3 years of study under a pre- 
ceptor and attendance on 2 full courses of lectures of 20 weeks each, with passage of the 
closing examinations; but all offered and urged a full 3 years’ graded course. 
A dental college was to be established in 1882 at the State University. 
For statistics of the above schools, see Tables XI, XII, and XIII of the appendix; for 
summaries of the same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Iowa Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Council Bluffs, offers a free education 
to all of this class in the State between the ages of 10 and 25; and yet in 1879-80 it was 
estimated that less than half the deaf-mutes in the State had at any time received the 
benefits of this training. The number of inmates in 1880-81 was 228, with 15 teachers, 
and it was believed that a compulsory law would more than double this number. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Iowa College for the Blind, Vinton, reporting biennially, in 1880-’81 had 12 
instructors and 90 pupils, making 448 pupils since its opening in 1853. In the school 
department the common English branches were taught, including raised print, penman- 
ship, algebra, and other studies of this grade. Instruction in vocal and instrumental 
music was given, especially in the use of the organ, piano, violin, and brass instruments. 
In the industrial department the boys were taught cane seating, mattress and broom 
making; the girls, sewing by hand and machine, knitting, crocheting, and bead work. 
School property was valued at $300,000. The library contained 1,000 volumes, 400 of 
which were in embossed type.— (Report and return.) 
TRAINING OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Iowa State Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children had 4 teachers and 203 pupils in 
1880-81. Kindergarten methods were used, with special attention to the health and 
physical development of the inmates. The results were encouraging.— (State report.) 
REFORM SCHOOLS, 
The Iowa Reform School, in its boys’ department, El Dorado, has had the training of 
801 boys since its opening in 1868, and had 201 inmates in September, 1881. During 
the two years covered by the report 115 had been committed, making the number in 
school during this time 295. Four hours a day were devoted to training in school, and 
four to work on the farm, in:the garden, and in the shops, where they were taught shoe- 
making, tailoring, and during the winter the making of straw hats. A large per cent. 
of the boys trained here are known to have become good citizens. The main building, 
unfinished at last report, was completed September, 1881. The profits from the farm 
and shops made an important item in the income of the institution. Looking upon the 
school as a home, few attempt to escape. 
The girls’ department, Mitchellville, reported in 1880-’81 that it had received 144 
girls since its opening and had 63 in school October, 1881. Every girl attended school four 
hours each day and received four hours’ instruction in some branch of household work. 
No one was permitted to leave till she could cook a dinner without help, wash and iron 
well, and do fine needlework, specimens of which had taken premiums at county fairs. 
The superintendent reaffirms that more than 70 per cent. committed have become per- 
manently reformed.— (Report, 1881.)

ART INSTRUCTION. 
No information for 1880-’81 appears in regard to a conservatory of art reported to have 
been established at Burlington in 1879; it was designed to offer instruction to all in the 
highest and simplest branches of art. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS. 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-sixth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held in the 
Opera House, Oskaloosa, December 27-29, 1881, President 8. Calvin, of Iowa City, in the 
chair. 
After the usual preliminary exercises and appointment of committees, President Calvin 
delivered the inaugural address. Not agreeing with all laudations of American schools, 
he yet claimed for them great praise, for he said: ‘‘Take a map of the country and mark 
in bright colors the regions where wealth, happiness, intelligence, culture, comfort, and 
prosperity abound, and you will mark the regions in which the public schools have been 
most cordially sustained. Call the roll of our illustrious men and women, and nearly 
every one will answer as from some of the public schools. But greatness is not owing to 
any system of education. The schools assist, not create talent and force of character. A 
diploma is no guarantee of fitness for any position. The schools can only so train a 
child as to make it possible for him to turn his native talent to the very best account, 
make him a fairly intelligént citizen, and confer the ability to speak and read his native 
language with ease, expression, and understanding. In doing this the danger is not in 
limitation, but in inflation and overloading our courses of study.’? The industrial edu- 
cation now often loudly called for, he said, is the proper work of great technologic schools 
with large endowments and equipments. It could not be added to the already numerous 
studies taught by one teacher in our ordinary common schools; nor could the sciences 
for which some call. To make instruction in these effective, there must be thoroughly 
trained teachers, considerable apparatus and means for experimental work. And these’ 
belong, in general, to higher institutions than the common school. This, for some time 
to come, must confine itself to elementary instruction, only trying to make this good. 
The second day was devoted to the reading and discussion of papers on ‘‘ The proper 
type of professional training;’’ ‘‘The effects of methods on the result of school work;’? 
“The teacher’s responsibility as a citizen;”’ ‘‘The moral element in education;’’ ‘The 
psychology of crime.’’? The last paper was discussed at length by several prominent 
teachers and college professors, all disapproving its propositions, viz: ‘‘That crime is 
only disease; punishment a retaliation; virtue and vice not different in kind, but only 
in degree.”’ 
The third day was opened by report of a committee on the inaugural address, fully 
indorsing it, followed by papers on ‘‘ How can we better supply our colleges with prop- 
erly prepared students of collegiate grade?’ ‘‘The best education; how far disciplinary? 
how far practical?’ and “‘ The use of the imagination in teaching.”’ 
After the election of officers for the ensuing year and adoption of resolutions the asso- 
ciation adjourned, having had present 206 from nearly every part of the State, makin; 
the session one of great interest.— (Iowa Normal Monthly, January and February, 1882. 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This body held its session in connection with that of the State Teachers’ Association, 
meeting in the mornings of Wednesday and Thursday, and in addition to the usual pre-

of examinations for the spring and fall months, and then discussed the topics ‘‘Are our 
certificates properly graded ?’’ and ‘‘Salary of county superintendents and their duties.’”’—

SOUTHWESTERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
This association comprises 25 counties in the southwestern corner of the State, and in no 
sense is in opposition to the State Teachers’ Association, having for its object the fostering 
of fraternal feeling and the promotion of the best interests of the schools in its field. It 
was organized in January, 1880, and held its first annual meeting at Red Oak in July 
following, at which Miss Ray, president of the association, presided. Of the second 
annual meeting no information has been received.—(Iowa Normal Monthly, August, 
1880.) 
ORATORICAL ASSOCIATION. 
The Eastern Iowa Inter High School contest was held at Monticello on Friday evening, 
April 29, 1881, in the presence of a large assemblage. In the oratorical class there were 
4 contestants from the high schools of West Waterloo, Tama City, Laporte City, and

STATE ORATORICAL CONTEST. 
The Iowa collegiate oratorial contest, to select a candidate to represent the State in the 
Inter State Oratorical Association of the Northwestern States, was held at Fayette, April 
14, 1881, in the presence of a crowded house. There were 10 contestants, representing 
Oskaloosa, State Agricultural, Iowa, Simpson, Tabor, and Cornell Colleges, the Iowa 
Wesleyan, Iowa State, Upper Iowa, and Central Universities. 
The first prize was awarded to Miss Minnie Brunson, of Upper Iowa University, and the 
second to James A. Curr, of the State University.— (Iowa Normal Monthly, May, 1881.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS, 
The educational interests of the State are under the supervision of a State superi- 
tendent of public instruction, elected every 2 years, who has power to appoint an as- 
sistantandaclerk. A State board of education examines teachers for State diplomas and 
a State board of commissioners has the management of the school funds. County school 
officers are superintendents, elected biennially by the people, and boards of examiners for 
the examination of teachers, such boards being composed of the county superintendent, 
who is chairman, and two competent persons, holders of first grade certificates, who are 
appointed for one year by the county commissioners on the nomination of the county 
superintendent. There are also district boards, composed of 3 members, elected by the 
people for 3 years, 1 going out each year. 
‘Women may vote in school meetings and hold school offices. By a provision of the 
State constitution no distinction may be made between the rights of males and females 
in the formation and regulation of schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
76 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The system comprises public graded and ungraded, high, and normal schools, teach- 
ers’ institutes, a State university, and State Agricultural College, as well as schools for the 
deaf and dumb and the blind. There are State normal school, State university, agri- 
cultural college, and public school funds to aid in sustaining these institutions. The 
income of the public school funds and such other means as the legislature may provide 
by taxation or otherwise are appropriated to the support of public schools. School in- 
come is distributed to the counties in proportion to the number of youth therein 5-21; 
but no district in which a common school is not taught at least 3 months in each 
year can receive any share of such funds. Districts may vote for school-house purposes 
an annual tax not to exceed 1 per cent. on taxable property, an equal tax for teachers’ 
wages, and for a public library a tax not to exceed 2 mills on the dollar. County 
teachers’ institutes of not less than 4 weeks in duration must be held annually by county 
superintendents; they are sustained by a State appropriation, a registration fee of $1 
from each member, and an equal sum collected from candidates for county teachers’ cer- 
tificates. Provision is also made for union institutes. Teachers’ certificates are of 
first, second, and third grades, and continue in force 2 years, 1 year, and 6 months, re- 
spectively. Teachers must report to county superintendents every term or forfeit their 
last month’s pay; county superintendents are required to report to the State superin- 
tendent once every term, giving an account of their own special work, and also to make 
an annual statistical report; the State superintendent’s report, since 1879, is biennial. 
No sectarian or religious doctrine can be taught in the schools, but the reading of the 
Bible is not prohibited. Since 1874, children between 8 and 14 have been required to 
attend school at least 12 weeks (6 of which must be consecutive) in each year, unless 
otherwise taught or unless excused from such attendance by the school board.—(School 
laws, 1881.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The reports from this State being biennial, and none being due for 1880-’81, the sta- 
tistics kindly furnished by Hon. H. C. Speer, State superintendent, supply the only offi- 
cial information available as to general educational affairs. These show progress in every 
respect except teachers’ pay and receipts for schools. The increase of pupils enrolled in 
the free schools was 17,600, more than twice the increase (7,532) in youth of school age. 
The gain in average attendance, however, was much smaller (2,109). School districts 
increased by 188; the number reporting, by 204; those having uniform text books, by 
1,528; and those having 3 months’ school or more, by 496. The average term of sehool 
was 10 days longer than in 1879-’80. There were 429 more school-houses, with 537 more 
rooms, the estimated value of school property having been increased by $251,342. Twen- 
ty-seven more men and 401 more women were employed, men, however, being paid $2.26 
Jess and women $2.21 less a month. Although receipts for school purposes were $419,914 
less than in the previous year, $158,010 more were spent on the schools. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Three Kindergiirten have been reported from Kansas at the date at which this goes to 
press: 1 at Lawrence, with 20 children, under 1 instructor, and 2 at Topeka. One of the 
latter, with 36 children and 2 instructors, formed the lowest preparatory section of the 
College of the Sisters of Bethany; the other, with 20 children and 1 instructor, was con- 
nected with a private school. 
For full particulars of these and of any others that may report for 1880-’81, see Table 
V of the appendix. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
The public schools of cities are in charge of city boards of education elected by the 
qualified voters and comprising 3 members for each ward in cities of over 15,000 inhabi- 
tants; 2 members in other cities. The boards elect superintendents to assist them in the 
management of the schools and committees for the examination of teachers.— (School laws. )

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Atchison makes return for 1880-’81 of 5 school buildings, with 30 rooms and 1,580 sit- 
tings, all valued, with sites, furniture, and apparatus, at $145,000. There was an aver- 
age attendance of 72 pupils to a teacher. There were 19 rooms for primary, 8 for gram- 
mar, and 1 for high school classes, which last had both male and female teachers. 
The Lawrence public school system comprises primary, grammar, and high schools, 
taught in 10 buildings, having 24 rooms. During 1880~’81 there was an increase in en- 
rolment of 50 pupils, or nearly 3 per cent., and in average daily attendance a gain of 57, 
or nearly 5 per cent. In the high school there were enrolled 121 pupils, 88 being in 
average daily attendance. A class of 20 was graduated, making 68 since the organiza- 
tion of the school in 1874, of whom 15 were boys and 53 girls. The number of cases of 
tardiness in the public schools decreased very largely during the year. Teachers’ meet- 
ings were well attended and much interest was manifested in them.— (City school report. ) 
Leavenworth reports an increase of 539 in the number of youth of school age, of 98 in 
the public school enrolment, and of 36 in average attendance. Besides the public school 
enrolment, about 856 pupils attended private and parochial schools, making 4,014, or 
65 per cent., of the school population in school some portion of the year. The schools 
are classed as primary, grammar, and high. Recently the number of grades (covering 
7 years) to reach the high school was increased from 13 to 28, affording more frequent 
opportunities for promotion, and pupils have since been admitted to the high school 
twice a year. About 200 were enrolled during the year, and 13 graduated. It is esti- 
mated that 15 per cent. of all the public school pupils enter the high school, and that 5 per 
cent. graduate from it. Preparation is given here for colleges of the highest rank. The 
regular courses (covering 4 years) are classical, Latin-scientific, and English-scientific, 
A new course has recently been arranged for students not wishing to graduate. Another 
change is the charging of a tuition fee in this school, $10 to residents and $40 to non- 
residents, a plan which is said to work well, the amount being cheerfully paid and the 
attendance remaining as large as before.— (City report, 1881.) 
The Zopeka public schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, were taught in 49 
rooms, with 2,394 sittings for study. There was an increase during the year of 174 in 
public school enrolment and of 542 in the number of youth of school age. It was esti- 
mated that 200 pupils attended private schools, making 3,311 in all.— (Return. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
KANSAS STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, EMPORIA. 
The school at Emporia, now the only one left of the 4 State normals which were in 
operation during the earlier years of the decade, reported for 1880-’81, besides 217 others, 
149 normal students and 21 normal graduates, of whom 18 were from the elementary or 
3 years’ course; of the others, 2 were from the advanced English course and 1 from the 
advanced English and Latin, the last two extending over 4 years. The professional work 
(most of it done in the training department) is grouped in a single year, and cannot be 
commenced until the academic work is completed. Tuition is free during the profes- 
sional year. Graduates receive diplomas which authorize them to,teach in the common 
schools of the State without further examination.— (Report and return.) 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Kansas Normal College and Business Institute, Fort Scott, organized in 1878, pre- 
sents preparatory, normal, scientific, classical, and business courses of study, confers the 
degrees of B. S. and B. A., and devotes special attention to the preparation of teachers. The 
teachers’ course, in which were enrolled 29 pupils in 1881, is completed in from 2 to 5 
terms, according to the degree of advancement on entering.— (Report and return.) 
The Kansas Normal School and Business Institute, Paola (also organized in 1878), pre- 
pares for teaching, for college, or for business. It reported 289 normal students and 13 
graduates in 1881, its normal course covering 3 years. The training school here com- 
rises 470 children, in 8 grades, besides a model district school numbering 56 pupils.— 
Catalogue and return. ) 
The Chetopa Normal High School is a 3 months’ summer normal held in public school 
buildings during vacation and sustained by subscriptions. About 200 pupils attended 
in 1881, of whom 70 were men.— (Return). 
There were courses of study for teachers in Baker, Highland, Lane, and Ottawa Univer- 
sities and in the State University, which last provides training in its preparatory depart- 
ment for those not fully prepared for strictly normal studies, and then carries them, with 
others, through a 3 years’ normal course. In this there were 38 students, 16 of them 
young men and 22 young women, in 1880-’81, of whom 8 were graduated.— (Catalogue 
of university.)

78 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
County normal institutes for teachers were advertised to be held in 53 counties, most 
of them during July and August, 1881. No statistics of attendance on them are avail- 
able, and it does not appear whether institutes were held in the remaining 30 counties of 
the State or not. The law permits the union of two or more counties for this purpose in 
cases where the population of each county is less than 3,000. 
A writer in The Educationist gives an account of the work in 25 of these institutes 
visited by him during July and August. He says that the work in the main was good, 
often reaching a high degree of excellence both in matter and method. Where there was 
failure it was chiefly in lack of attention to method, and in making the work almost 
wholly scholastic. Several institutes had critics who reported each morning on the work 
of the preceding day, and some had reporters for the daily papers. There was, however, 
@ conspicuous and hurtful absence of reference books in the teaching, also a lack of illus- 
trative apparatus. As a rule the teachers of the larger towns and cities were not present; 
but on the part of all who did attend marked earnestness and industry were shown.— 
(The Educationist, September, 1881.) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Educationist, a monthly published and edited by the former State superintendent 
of public instruction in Indiana, Hon. George W. Hoss, Emporia, is the official organ 
of the department of public instruction and of the State Teachers’ Association, and the 
chief medium for the diffusion of educational information in the State. The Industrialist, 
a weekly published at Manhattan, is the organ of the Kansas Agricultural and Mechan- 
ical College, and is devoted specially to industrial education. The former was in its 
third volume in 1881 and the latter in its seventh. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
These are substantially provided forin union and graded school districts and explicitly 
inall cities of the first class, namely, those with more than 15,000inhabitants. Thenumber 
in operation durmg 1880-81 cannot be given, nor can thestatistics of attendance. There 
were, however, in 1878 about 60. Six had in 1881 adopted the course of study prescribed. 
by the State university as preparatory to it. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
For statistics of business colleges and private academic schools, see Tables IV and VI 
of the appendix following, and for summaries of them, corresponding tables in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. For preparatory departments of colleges and scientific 
schools, see Tables IX and X of the appendix. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, opened as a denominational institution in 1859 
and chartered as a State university in 1863, had in 1881 organized 3 of the departments 
contemplated in the act of incorporation, viz: a department of science, literature, and the 
arts, and normal and law departments. The first comprises a classical and a modern 
literature course, each leading to the degree of bachelor of arts, and a general scientific 
course and 3 special scientific courses, leading to the degree of bachelor of science. Tui- 
tion is free. Young men and women are admitted on equal terms and study in the same 
classes. Since the opening of the university there have been 2,166 students (nearly 
equally divided between the sexes) and since 1873 58 have been graduated from the col- 
legiate department. The whole number attending in 1880-’81 was 466, about the same 
as that of the previous year, 156 belonging to the collegiate classes, 277 to the prepara- 
tory department, and the remainder to the normal, law, and musical departments. Out 
of a class of 10 young men and 9 young women graduated from the collegiate depart- 
ment, all received the degree of bachelor of arts except 6 young men, who became bache- 
lors of science.— (Catalogue and return.) 
Seven other collegiate institutions report, viz: St. Benedict’s College, Atchison; Baker 
University, Baldwin; Highland University, Highland; Lane University, Lecompton; 
Ottawa University, Ottawa; St. Mary’s College, St. Mary’s, and Washburn College, To- 
peka. Two of these are Roman Catholic; the other 5 are under the influence, respectively, 
of the Methodist Episcopal, Presbyterian, United Brethren, Baptist, and Congregational 
Churches. All but the two Roman Catholic colleges admit both sexes. All report pre- 
paratory departments, with courses of from 2 to 3 years, and classical courses of 4 years;  
-P-A-G-E-357
  
KANSAS, ; 
5 had scientific courses, 1 a literary and 1 a ladies’ course (all of 4 years); 3 had normal 
courses; 4, commercial; 3, departments of music, and 1, a department of art. 
For statistics, see Table IX of the appendix, and a summary of it in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Besides opportunities for the superior instruction of women afforded in all but 2 of the 
colleges and universities above noted, further provision is made for them in the College 
of the Sisters of Bethany, a Protestant Episcopal institution at Topeka, which presents 
primary, preparatory, and collegiate courses of study, ‘the last extending over 3 years. 
For statistics of the college, see Table VIII of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Kansas State Agricultural College, Manhattan, one of the first established under 
the congressional grant of 1862, gives practical instruction in the various industries of 
farm, shop, and home; also in literary and scientific branches, including civil engineering. 
The course extends over4 years. Tuition is free and provision is made for training women. 
as well as men in the industries suited to them, printing, telegraphy, sewing, and cookery 
being among the branches taught. Of 259 pupils in the regular courses, 84 were women; 
and the 12 graduates who received the degree of B. S. were equally divided between the 
sexes. For further statistics, see Table X of the appendix, and a corresponding table in 
thereportofthe Commissionerpreceding. Of the4scientific coursesin the State university, 
each covering 4 years and leading to the degree of B. s., 1 is in general science, the others 
in chemistry, natural history, and civil and topographical engineering. Five of the other 
colleges and universities report courses in general science extending over 4 years. For 
statistics of students in scientific courses of colleges, see Table IX of the appendix. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The Kansas Theological School, Topeka (Protestant Episcopal), organized in 1873, has 
a 3 years’ course of study and requires an examination for admission. Except in special 
cases a collegiate training or its equivalent is insisted on asa preparation. The bishop of 
the diocese is ex officio president. Candidates for orders in 1881 reported, 4; instructors, 2. 
The law department of the University of Kansas, organized in 1878, is intended to pre- 
pare students for practice at the bar in any State of the Union. The course extends over 
2 years of 7 months each. All intending to enter are advised to first take a course of 
liberal studies. Graduates of literary colleges are admitted without examination; all 
others must satisfy the faculty that they possess the educational and other qualifications 
necessary to pursue the study with profit. Students in 1880-81 reported, 15; instructors, 
2; graduates for the year, 8.— (University catalogue. ) 
A preparatory medical course has been established at the State university, which is 
meant to be the first year of a 3 years’ course. A collegiate training is recommended as 
a preparation for it, and a knowledge of English branches such as is required for admis- 
sion to college is demanded. No note of students in it appears in 1880-’81.— (Catalogue 
of university. ) ’ 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Kansas Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Olathe, offers to the 
deaf and dumb of Kansas, 10 to 21 years of age, free tuition, board, books, and other neces- 
saries, leaving only clothing and travelling expenses to be provided by them. The length 
of the course permitted is in ordinary cases 6 years, but the average time really spent by 
each pupil is only 3} years. During 1880-’81 there were 171 pupils under instruction, 
the course comprising the common school branches and articulation, besides such employ- 
ments . printing, cabinet making, shoemaking, sewing, and housework.— (Report and 
return. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
In the Kansas Institution for the Education of the Blind, Wyandotte, pupils are taught 
the English branches, with reading in Boston elevated type, and both reading and writing 
in New York point. They are also trained in certain employments, the boys in broom 
and brush making, the girls in hat weaving. Four hours a day are given to labor, for 
which wages are paid, thus securing ambition and cheerfulness in the work and enabling 
pupils to earn most of their clothing.— (Report. )

  80 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
A State reform school for boys was established by legislative act in 1879 and opened 
for the admission of pupils June, 1881. It is under the control and management of the 
board of State charitable institutions, and is open to boys 8 to 14 years of age who are 
either neglected and exposed to temptation, incorrigible, truants, vagrants, or offenders 
against the laws. The plan of management is educational and reformatory rather than 
penal. Results will be sought through intelligent and well directed appeals to the man- 
Tiness of pupils. The site of the school is a farm of 160 acres about three miles from To- 
peka. Itis intended, with the aid of the boys, to cultivate small fruit and vegetables, and, 
in time, to teach them such useftl trades as may be found practicable.— (Report, issi.} 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Kansas State Teachers’ Association met in Manhattan, June 21, 1882, remaining 
insession threedays. After the appointment of committees, President William Wheeler, 
of Ottawa, read his inaugural addresson ‘‘ Books and reading,’’ making a strong argument 
for good books for children and reprobating parents, teachers, and book makers who fur- 
nish or permit the reading of the popular but pernicious cheap novel and sensational 
story. The first paper of the following day, ‘‘The Emile of Rousseau,’ by Miss Grace 
Bibb, of the University of Missouri, stated fully and clearly the cardinal points in Rous- 
seau’s theory of education. A paper was then read by S. M. Greenwood, superintendent 
of the Kansas City schools, which contained a vigorous arraignment of the educational 
theories of Charles Francis Adams, Richard Grant White, andothers. Hon. O. S. Munsell, 
of Council Grove, gave an address entitled ‘‘Mosaic compared with modern biology;’? 
Prof. D. E. Sanders, principal of the normal school at Fort Scott, read a paper on ‘‘ Educa- 
tional shams,’’ and Prof. R. C. Meade, of Atchison, one on ‘‘The training of children.’’ 
At the evening session, Miss Ida AhlIburn, principal of the Jewell City schools, read apaper 
on ‘‘Our work,’’ and one on “‘ Literature in the public schools’? was presented by a writer 
in The Educationist, presumably the editor, Hon. George W. Hoss. On the following day 
a paper entitled ‘‘ Practical suggestions’? was read by Prof. D. H. Robinson, of the State 
university, and another on ‘Educational forces,’’ by Prof. J. R. Campbell, of Newton. 
Officers were then elected for the ensuing year, and after the adoption of a number of 
resolutions the association adjourned. 
Among the resolutions was one agreeing to make all reasonable efforts to have trees 
planted in school yards and to encourage improvements tending to render attractive or 
comfortable school grounds or buildings, and another by which members pledged their 
united efforts in aid of the enforcement of the prohibition law, considering that edu- 
cation, as well as other interests, required such a law.— (The Educationist, July, 1881.) 
SUPERINTENDENTS’ CONVENTION. 
A convention of the county superintendents of Kansas met June 21-23, at Manhattan, 
State Superintendent H. C. Speer presiding. After the appointment of committees the 
relation of the county superintendent to normal institute work was discussed by H. D. 
McCarty and Superintendents Lee, Bishop, Chidister, and others. On the second day 
Superintendent Bogle, of Marion County, spoke at length against the advisability of re- 
quiring teachers to send monthly reports to superintendents. The subject was discussed 
by a large number of superintendents, most of whom thought that term reports were 
sufficient. The question ‘‘ What shall be done to enforce the compulsory school law?” 
was presented by Superintendent Bishop, of Saline County; a paper was read by Miss 
Eva A. Hobart, of Anderson County, on ‘‘The management of teachers’ associations,’’ 
and one by Superintendent Oliver, of Jefferson County, on ‘‘ Teachers’ certificates; how 
to grade them.”’ The only paper of the third day was by Superintendent L. T. Gage, 
of Shawnee County, on ‘‘ How to make official school visitation valuable.” He thought 
county superintendents should have the right to give commands rather than suggestions 
to teachers. In the spirited discussion which followed members were about equally di- 
vided between ‘‘suggestion,” ‘‘authority,’’ and ‘‘advice.”’— (The Educationist. ) 
ASSOCIATION OF CITY SUPERINTENDENTS AND HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPALS. 
The city superintendents and high school principals met at Manhattan, June 23. 
Among other work done, there was referred to a committee for consideration ‘‘A course 
of study for towns and smaller cities;’’ and to another committee, ‘‘A course of study for 
unorganized high schools.’’— (The Educationist, July, 1881.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The State school officers are a superintendent of public instruction, elected by the 
people for 4 years; a State board of education, comprising the superintendent, the secre- 
tary of state, the attorney general, and 2 professional teachers chosen by them; also a 
State board of examiners for the examination of teachers, composed of the superintend- 
ent and 2 professional educators chosen by him.

82 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Local oflicers are county common school commissioners, elected by the county court of 
claims for 2 years; county boards of examiners, composed of the commissioner and 2 per- 
sons appointed by him; and district boards of trustees (separate ones for white and colored 
schools) of 3 members, who hold office 3 years. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The common school system established in accordance with the State constitution re- 
quires that the schools be equally accessible to the poor and to the rich and open to all 
white youth 6 to 20; that they be taught by a qualified teacher for 5 months (or for 3 
months if in a district containing less than 40 children); and that no books, tracts, or 
papers of a sectarian or infidel character be used or distributed in them. 
The schools for white children are supported from the income of a State fund, all fines 
and forfeitures set apart by law, a State tax of-20 cents on the $100 of taxable property, 
and an optional district tax of 25 cents on the $100, which last may be made 30 cents in 
graded school districts. A capitation tax of 50 cents on persons sending children to school 
may be assessed by trustees to provide fuel and for other contingent expenses. The schools 
for colored children are supported from taxes on property owned or held by colored per- 
sons, a capitation tax of $1 on each colored man over 21, taxes on dogs kept by colored per- 
sons, and on deeds, suits, and licenses, and by fines and penalties collected from them. 
The legal school age for colored children is 6 to 16. Except that separate district boards 
of trustees are provided for colored schools, the same officers have charge of those for both 
races. In 1882 colored children are to have an equal share of the State funds. 
Provision is made for county teachers’ institutes, a State teachers’ association, public 
school libraries, a university, an agricultural and mechanical college, and institutions 
for the deaf and dumb, the blind, and the feeble-minded. Any non-sectarian college, 
academy, or high school may be accepted by the county commissioner as a State school, 
and as such share in the school funds, if all the white children of the district 6 to 20 be 
admitted without charge for 5 months of the year. Trustees must report annually to the 
county commissioners, and they to the State superintendent. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show an increase during the year of more than 8,000 in the number of 
youth of legal school age, a little over half of this being among the whites. The school 
age for whites is 6 to 20; for colored, 6 to 16. The attendance on colored schools in 
1880-81 is not given in the report, but it appears that the number enrolled in schools for 
whites (238,440) is less than that of the previous year by 6,918, while the number re- 
quiring education was greater by 4,807. Still there seems to be considerable increase in 
the expenditure for white schools ; more school districts, both for white and colored, were + 
reported, and more schools for both races were taught; there was an increase in the num- 
ber of school-houses for whites, and a corresponding one in the value of public school 
property for their use; but the difference between the $2,286,104, at which such property 
for whites is rated, and the $109,648, at which that for colored youth is put, clearly 
shows how much this latter class needs fuller provision for school buildings. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
The city public schools are usually under the control of boards of trustees, which ap- 
point city superintendents. In some cities, under special charters, boards of examiners 
are appointed for the examination of teachers. This board in Louisville comprises the 
city superintendent and 6 professional teachers.

Covington reports a smaller school population than the previous year by 463, fewer pu- 
pils by 1,000 enrolled in public schools, and 115 fewer in average attendance under 3 
fewer teachers. Schools were taught 10 months of the year in 6 buildings.
-P-A-G-E-361
  KENTUCKY. | 83 
Lexington, besides 4,961 pupils in public schools, reports 640 attending private or pa- 
rochial schools. Property used for public school purposes was valued at about $41,000. 
The schools were in session 238 days. 
Louisville, with an increase of 2,250 in school population, had 801 fewer pupils in publi¢ 
schools and 228 fewer in average attendance. ‘The schools were taught 204 days by 327 
teachers, including special teachers, all but 35 of them women. There were 32 special 
teachers of German, in which language a graded course is presented extending over 7 years. 
Five of the public schools were for colored children, but the number in attendance is not re- 
ported. Inthe twohigh schools there were 582 pupils enrolled and 518 in average attend- 
ance.— (Return and public school manual. ) , 
The Newport public schools were taught 10 months by 42 instructors (of whom 3 were 
men) in 7school buildings valued at $84,000. The high school had 48 pupils, with 44 in 
average attendance. 
Paducah reports a decrease in school population of 2, an increase in enrolment of 18 
pupils, with 8 fewer in average attendance; schools taught 10 months during the year; 
3 men and 12 women teaching in 4 brick school-houses, with 14 rooms and 950 sittings; 
59 pupils enrolled in public high schools, with 54 in average attendance, and an estimated 
enrolment in private and parochial schools of 225.—(Return.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
The State superintendent reports 16 normal schools, having 575 students attending for 
an average term of 6 months. One of these, however, he subsequently writes, was mis- 
takenly reported by a county commissioner; another was a temporary normal of 3 weeks 
in Trimble County; a third, the annual county institute of Hopkins County; a fourth 
- was closed. The remaining 12 were Alexander College, Burksville; East Kentucky 
Normal School, Catlettsburg; Clinton College, Clinton; Kentucky State Normal School, 
Farmdale; Glasgow Normal School, Glasgow; Hartford Academy, Hartford; Agricult- 
ural and Mechanical College, Lexington; Mountain Normal School, Martinsburg; May- 
field Seminary, Mayfield; Normal School, Morgantown; Murray Institute, Murray; and 
Kentucky Classical and Business College, North Middletown, 
Besides these, the names of some of which are on the academic and collegiate lists of 
this Bureau, while the status of some others as normal schools is at least doubtful for 
1881, there are on the normal list of the Bureau for 1881 the Kentucky Presbyterian 
Normal School, Anchorage (a department of Bellewood Female Seminary), the normal , 
department of Berea College, Berea, with the like department of Columbus College, Co- 
lumbus, and that of South Kentucky College, Hopkinsville, besides the semi-normal 
Kentucky Female Orphan School, Midway. r 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
A county teachers’ institute is required by law to be held in each county, the sessions 
to be not more than 6 days, during which there is a vacation of the schools, and all teach- 
ers of the county are required to attend on penalty of forfeiting their certificates, unless 
there be a satisfactory excuse given to the county commissioner. There were 93 institutes 
held during 1880-81, having a total attendance of 3,265.. Only 805 teachers in all the 
counties were absent. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Eclectic Teacher, the most important of the educational journals published in this 
State, and the only one that contained much general information as to the State school 
system, was discontinued in 1881. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Seven cities and towns report to the State superintendent statistics of 9 public high 
schools, in which 936 pupils were enrolled and 869 were in average attendance. No 
information is given as to the courses of study in these schools or the branches taught, 
farther than that the classes are superior to those of the graded common schools. Louis- 
ville, included in the above, sustains 2 such schools for whites, 1 for each sex, and during 
the year had 562 pupils enrolled in the 2, with 539 in average daily attendance. Some 
higher instruction is believed to be also given in one of the schools for colored youth. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The State superintendent reports 201 private academic schools, with an average session 
of 9 months during 1880-’81; public schools were taught in connection with 26 of these 
schools. For full statistics of all such schools reporting to this Office, see Table VI of the 
appendix; for statistics of business colleges and of schools preparatory to college, see 
Tables IV and VII.  
-P-A-G-E-362
84 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Six of the 16 colleges and universities in this State in 1881 admitted both sexes, an 
increase in this class of 1 since 1880.. All but 2 of the 16 were denominational, the 
Christian Church controlling 4; the Baptist and Roman Catholic, each, 3; the Presby- 
terian, 2, and the Congregational and Methodist, each, 1. All report classical courses of 
4 years and preparatory departments, a number also giving instruction in primary 
branches; 8 had scientific courses, and 1 of these also a course in engineering; 4 gave 
normal training; 4, theological or biblical; 1, medical; 9, business or commercial, and 2, 
legal; 2 offered separate courses for ladies; in 4 there were departments of music and art, 
and in 6 French and German were taught. For statistics, see Table IX. ° ; 
One of the above, South Kentucky College, Hopkinsville, was exclusively for the 
higher education of women until 1881, when the charter was amended, the college re- 
organized and opened to both sexes. The curriculum, too, was made to include prepara- 
tory, classical, normal, commercial, music, art, and law departments; also, French and 
German. : 
Central University, Richmond, received during the year, from various friends, gifts 
amounting to $50,000, and Berea College, Berea, $54,048 for endowment and current 
' expenses. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Nearly all of the twenty or more colleges and seminaries for women reporting from 
this State are authorized by law to confer collegiate degrees. They present collegiate 
courses of 4 years, which include Latin, Greek, modern languages, music, drawing, and 
painting. At least 4 make also some provision for the instruction of those who intend to 
teach. 
For statistics of these colleges, see Table VIII of the appendix, and for a summary of 
them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
As was stated in the report from this Office for 1880, the Agricultural and Mechanical 
College of Kentucky has been permanently established at Lexington, the city and county 
having contributed 350,000 for buildings. A State tax for its support, of 5 mills on each 
$100 of taxable property, with other funds, provides an annual income of about $27,000. 
No information later than the above has been received, the process of reorganization 
being probably incomplete. 
Courses in general science, usually extending over 4 years, are reported by 8 other 
institutions for superior instruction, one of them, Kentucky Military Institute, also pre- 
senting # course in civil engineering. 
For statistics of scientific schools reporting, see Table X of the appendix, and for a 
summary of these, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
For statistics of scientific departments in colleges, see Table IX. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The theological schools are Danville Theological Seminary (Presbyterian), with a 3 years’ 
course of study and 8 students in it in 1881, of whom 4 had received collegiate degrees; 
the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, organized on the plan of independ- 
ent schools, of which there are 8, and reporting 94 students; and the College of the Bible, 
‘Lexington, which presents an English course of 4 years and a classical one of 2, had 67 
students and 7 graduates, all but 1 from the English course. The first named is the only 
one of the three which requires an examination for admission of applicants not college 
graduates; the last does not profess to be a strictly professional school, but to give instruc- 
tion in the Bible and in some higher branches of English literature and philosophy. Bib- 
lical instruction in connection with college studies is given in Berea College, Berea (Con- 
gregational), Eminence College, Eminence (Christian), and Kentucky Wesleyan College, 
Millersburgh (Methodist). ’ 
For further statistics of theological schools reporting, see Table XI of the appendix, and 
for a summary of this, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal instruction continued to be given in 1880-81 in the law department of the Uni- 
versity of Louisville, the course of study extending over 2 years of 5 months each. The 
diploma (a license to practise in any court in the State) is bestowed only after a sat- 
istactory examination. Kentucky University, Lexington, still retained in its catalogue 
the advertisement of its school of law, with 4 professors and a 2years’ course; but there 
was no note of any students. That of Central University, Richmond, seemingly dropped 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
  KENTUCKY. 85 
in 1879~’80, does not reappear in subsequent catalogues. South Kentucky College, Hop- 
kinsville, in connection with the college course, gives instruction in constitutional, inter- 
national, and commercial law. 
The 4 medical schools reporting (all in Louisville), namely, the Kentucky School of 
Medicine, Hospital College of Medicine (a department of Central College, Richmond), 
Louisville Medical College, and the medical department of the University of Louisville, 
give a total attendance of 529 students in 1881 and 275 graduates. All require for gradu- 
ation the ordinary 3 years of medical study, including 2 terms of lectures, the minimum 
term required by the American Medical Association. The two schools first named offer 
an optional graded course of 3 years, which, at the Hospital College of Medicine, students 
are urged and after 1882-83 will be required to take. No examination is required for 
admission in any of the above, but the Hospital College encourages thorough study by 
offering a special honorary mention in its catalogue of such graduating students as reach 
90 per cent. in a final written examination. 
The Louisville College of Pharmacy, requiring for graduation an apprenticeship of 4 
years and attendance on 2 courses of lectures, reports 45 students and 8 graduates dur- 
Ing 1881. 
For statistics, see Table XIII of the appendix, and for a summary, see a corresponding 
table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The State sustains an institution for the training of the deaf and dumb, at Danville, 
in which are taught the usual branches of a common school education, also printing, 
book binding, carpentry, broom and mattress making, gardening, sewing, fancy work, 
and housework. Articulation is taught to a few semi-mutes. There were 139 pupils 
under instruction during 1881. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Kentucky Institution for the Education of the Blind, Louisville, had 81 pupils, 
who were all instructed in the ordinary English branches, those whose abilities promised 
success receiving also special training in vocal and instrumental music. Physical exer- 
cise holds an important place in the plan of instruction, an hour and a half daily 
being devoted to calisthenics. The boys are taught to make brooms, to cane chairs, and 
to dosimple upholstery work, such as the making and repairing of mattresses and lounges; 
the girls are taught hand and machine sewing, the cutting of garments, and knitting. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Kentucky Institution for the Education and Training of Feeble-Minded Children, 
Frankfort, gives instruction in the common school branches and in such employments as 
carpentry, shoemaking, mattress and broom making, gardening, housework, and sewing. 
The most capable bays are put to the carpenter’s trade; those of the next grade, it is 
found, can be taught to be good shoemakers; and the others are trained in simpler 
industries. Once a week a company of boys are instructed in military tactics. The 
girls take turns in the laundry, kitchen, and sewing departments; they learn to cut, fit, 
and make their own and the boys’ clothing. There were 132 under the care of the insti- 
tution during the year, 71 boys and 61 girls.— (Catalogue and return.) 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Louisville House of Refuge, intended for the training of neglected youth, receives 
boys and girls, white and colored, giving them instruction in the common school branches 
and in the employments of shoemaking, gardening; cane seating, housework, and sew- 
ing. The attendance for 1881 was 178 white boys and girls and 89 colored boys, with 
209 inmates remaining December 31, 1881. There were 137 under school instruction 
during the year.— (Catalogue and return.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
KENTUCKY STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The State Teachers’ Association was advertised to meet at Elizabethtown July 12-15, 
1881, but no account of the proceedings has been received. Among the subjects on the 
programme for addresses and papers were coeducation, denominational colleges, moral 
training by the teacher, methods of teaching reading, use and abuse of text books, com- 
pulsory’ so and the training for women demanded by American life.— (Eclectic

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The chief executive school officer under the constitution of 1879 is a State superin- 
tendent of public instruction, chosen by the people for a term of 4 years. The superin- 
tendent, governor, other State officers, and 2 citizens appointed by the governor for 4 
years constitute a State board of education. The duties of the State board are to make 
all needful rules and regulations for the government of the free public schools and for 
the examination and employment of teachers, to select text books and apparatus, and 
to appoint and remove directors of parish boards, except in New Orleans. The parish 
boards have charge of school interests in their respective parishes, dividing them into as 
many wards and districts as may be deemed necessary, appointing auxiliary visiting 
trustees for each district, and appointing also from their own number special committees to 
examine teachers. They may appoint a parish superintendent, who shall be ex officio 
secretary of the parish board, receiving for such double service not more than $200 a 
year, except in the parish of Orleans, where the salary is fixed by the general assem- 
bly. Women over 21 years of age are eligible to any educational office created by the 
laws of the State.— (Digest, 1877, and constitution, 1879.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The constitution provides for free public schools for all the children in the State between 
the ages of 6 and 18. The schools are to be supported (1) from the proceeds of a State 
fund of $1,130,868, bearing 4 per cent. interest, to be paid annually to the townships in 
proportion to the number of youth of school agein each; (2) froma poll tax of $1 to $1.50
-P-A-G-E-365
LOUISIANA. 87 
on each male over 21 years of age, to be applied to the support of public schools in the 
parish where it is collected; (3) from a State tax not to exceed 1 mill on $1; (4) from 
a local levy of 2 mills on $1, which any parish board may order. No teacher can be 
legally employed without passing an examination and receiving a certificate of compe- 
tency from the parish board. This is valid for 2 years, but is liable to. forfeiture for 
cause. While parish boards are required to establish a free school in every district or 
ward, no school of less than 10 pupils may be opened nor more than 60 be allowed to 1 
teacher. - 
The schools in each parish must be visited each month by a committee of the parish 
board, and any director failing for two consecutive months to do his duty forfeits his 
membership in the board. 
The general exercises and elementary instruction in the public schools must be in 
English, except in parishes where the French predominate, in which case the elementary 
branches may be taught in French if it can be done without additional expense. 
Public school funds must not be used in support of sectarian schools.— (Constitution 
of 1879 and digest of 1877.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The unsatisfactory condition of the public schools existing in 1880 was not improved 
in 1881. The exceedingly small aid provided by the State remained the same. Ex- 
tensive suffering from floods prevented in many parishes the collection of additional 
local school taxes, as well as kept many schools from being opened and many children 
from attending school, while from the want of a school law corresponding with the new 
constitution there was sometimes embarrassment in determining what was permitted 
or required. Hence the school machinery worked at a disadvantage, and the results 
were far less than could be desired. Although $6,470 more were, with great effort, 
raised for public schools, and, according to the State report, $29,626 more spent for 
them, the school enrolment not only failed to keep pace with the 16,191 increase of 
school youth, but fell 6,070 below that of the year before; so that the per cent. of enrol- 
ment on youth to be instructed fell from about 25 to 21.5. School sessions, too, were 
about 18 days shorter on an average; school teachers, however, apparently getting an 
average of $4 a month more pay. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
The arrangements enteréd into by the late Dr. Sears, establishing in New Orleans 2 
Peabody normal seminaries for the free education of white and colored teachers, seem to 
have been continued, although only the one for white pupils reported for 1880-81. The 
Peabody fund distribution to both schools is given in the report of the trustees and agent 
as $1, 500 for both schools from February 1, 1881, with $200 for the Louisiana Educa- 
tional Journal. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The Kindergarten Institute of New Orleans, organized October 4, 1881, admits pupils 
between 4 and 11 years of age. At date of report it had, besides the conductor, 4 assist- 
ants and 63 pupils.— (Return. ) 
For further information of this and others heretofore reported, see Table V of the 
appendix. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
NEW ORLEANS. 
Officers.— For the control of the public schools this city has a board of 20 directors, 8 
appointed by the State board of education and 12 by the board of administrators of New 
Orleans, with a superintendent appointed by the directors. 
Statistics. — Population in 1880, 216,090; youth of school age, 61,456; enrolled in public 
schools, 24,401; average daily attendance, if, 566; teachers, 402; expenditures, $274,844.— 
(City report and return, ) 
Additional particulars.—There were 55 schools under the care of the city board, occu- 
pying 402 rooms for recitation and study; they were classed as high, grammar, primary, 
and a special primary with Kindergarten features. The school course below the high 
school covers 8 years, giving to the primary and grammar 4 each. Of the 52 grammar 
and primary schools 13 were for colored children. There were 12 large modern school 
buildings erected from the proceeds of the McDonough school fund, while the others 
belonging to the city were old frame houses, lacking modern improvements. The remain- 
ing 13 were rented buildings, poorly adapted to school purposes, and yet they contained 
18 per cent. of the children in school. There were, however, encouraging indications of 
more attention to the sanitary condition and surroundings of the school-houses. School 
property was valued at $637,500.!— (City report and return.)   
1In connection with this sketch of the city schools of 1881 comes information that in 1882 a former 
citizen, Mr, Paul Tulane, of New Jersey, has given to the city a large amount of property within it for the furtherance of higher education, ’ Estimates place it at from $400,000 to $2,000,000.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS. 
The Peabody Normal Seminary, New Orleans, continued to offer free normal training 
to white graduates of high schools or colleges and other advanced students over 16 years 
of age from any portion of the State. In its normal department it had junior and senior 
classes, with a 3 years’ course, in which previous studies were reviewed according to the 
best known methods. In a model school connected with it classes of children were 
assigned for an hour each day to members of the senior class to enable them to acquire 
aptitude and experience in teaching and managing schools. The normal pupils for 1880-81 
numbered 70; other pupils, 20; all under 5 instructors. The graduates for the year were 
10, of whom 5 were, at date of the return, engaged in teaching. Vocal music entered 
into the instruction given; there was a respectable library of books on the science and 
art of teaching, while several educational journals were recived. Graduates of distine- 
tion are encouraged to return to pursue advanced optional studies, and to such as prove 
their capacity to teach schools of academic grade are awarded diplomas with the degree 
of p. P. (doctrina perita.) — (Report and return.) 
The Peabody Normal School for Colored Students, established at New Orleans in 1877, with 
a 2 years’ course, gratuitously fits graduates and advanced scholars, of the higher 
grades of schools over 17 years of age for the work of teaching. No report for 1881 has 
reached this Bureau. 
The normal department of Straight. University, New Orleans (colored), aims in a 3 years’ 
course to train both sexes for teaching; it reported 81 normal students in 1880—’81, with 
61 entered for the following year, of which latter number 29 were women and 32 men, 
under 4 teachers.— (Catalogues. ) 
The New Orleans University (colored) had in 1880-81 a normal course of 2 years, but 
did not indicate the number of normal students.— (Annual report of Freedmen’s Aid So- 
ciety of Methodist Episcopal Church, 1881.) 
Leland University, New Orleans, forms annual normal classes for such students as de- 
sire to prepare for teaching, but does not report how many normal pupils were under 
training in 1880~’81 out of its 144 students. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
It is not known that any teachers’ institutes were held in 1880-’81. Through the aid 
of the Peabody fund arrangements were made to hold a few in some of the larger towns 
in 1882.— (State report. ) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL, 
The Louisiana Journal of Education, published monthly in New Orleans, maintained in 
its second year the high standard of usefulness it had reached in its first year. One of the 
editors was formerly State superintendent and the other is city superintendent of New 
Orleans. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Of the three high schools in New Orleans reported in 1879 the one for colored pupils 
seems to have been suspended, asnoreport of it appears in 1880-81. The others, 1 for boys 
and 1 for girls, were reorganized so as to extend the course of study for each from 2 to 3 
years. There were 9 teachers and a total enrolment of 267, of whom 88 were in the 
boys’ and 179 in the girls’ school, the total average daily attendance being 81 per cent. of 
the total enrolment. No other high schools in the State are reported.— (City report.) 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and schools for preparing 
students for college,-see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix, and summaries of 
these in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, 
the university part of which was organized in 1860, the agricultural and mechanical in 
1874, appears, as reported for 1880-’81, to have gained from the consolidation which has 
been effected. Its yearly income is now $24,556, from 5 per cent. on $182,313, the fund 
of the Agricultural and Mechanical College ; from 4 per cent. on $136,000, seminary fund ; 
and from an annual State appropriation of $10,000. At the opening of the session of 
1880-81, the new institution was reorganized. The general management was placed 
under the control of a board of supervisors, 12 appointed by the governor, with annual 
change of 3, the governor, superintendent of public education, and president of the
-P-A-G-E-367

faculty being ex officiomembers. Discipline was intrusted to the president of the faculty, 
and is strictly military. The optional systeni under which the institution had been con- 
ducted, and which had led to no degrees, was changed for stated courses, with absolute 
requirements and a fixed Standard for degrees. 
In place of former schools of literature, science, useful and fine arts, of military science 
and art, of medicine and law, the university courses were made a classical and scientific 
of 4 years each, and agricultural and mechanical courses of 2 years, leading to corre- 
sponding degrees of bachelor of arts, bachelor of science, graduate in agriculture, and 
graduate in mechanics. A preparatory department fits for the university courses or for 
those of agriculture and mechanics. During the year, a workshop was erected and fur- 
nished with carpenters’ tools. The faculty numbered 10 and the cadets 69. No tuition 
fees are charged and no female students are admitted. The institution had a library of 
17,000 volumes.— (Catalogue. ) 
The University of Louisiana, at New Orleans (non-sectarian), is a separate institution 
from the State University at Baton Rouge, having existed since 1847 and having been 
recognized and provided for by the constitution of 1879. It has law, medical, and aca~ 
demic departments, the last including, in 1881, schools of Latin, Greek, English, mathe- 
matics, physics and mechanics, chemistry, French, and German. This university is to 
receive annually from the State a sum not exceeding $10,000. The degrees to be con- 
ferred are B. A., M. A., B. S., and B, LIT. There were 17 members of the faculty, besides 
lecturers and other instructors, in 1880-81, and 506 students, including 180 high school 
and 87 academic. French is taught throughout, and is used in the recitations of the 
senior classes. Instruction is in schools. There is no curriculum or prescribed course 
for the college as a whole.— (Catalogue. ) 
A university for the education of persons of color was authorized by article 231 of the 
constitution of 1879, and under act 87 of the general assembly of 1880 it was organized 
as the Southern University for Colored Students, with a grant from the State purporting to 
be of $10,000 annually. The institution was opened to students in January, 1881, and 
enrolled a considerable number of students; but, from the fact that it was without funds 
and that its trustees were unwilling to sacrifice at a ruinous discount the warrants of the 
State which constituted its only assets, its sessions were closed in June of that year, and 
even the property purchased for its use was in danger or being sacrificed.— (State school 
report. ) 
Leland University celebrated its eighth anniversary May 25, 1881, conferring the degree 
of A. B. on two young men who had completed the regular collegiate course and grad- 
uating 6 others from its higher English course, one of whom was a young lady.— (Watch- 
man, July 14, 1881.) 
Other institutions of this class reported in some form for 1880-’81 were Jefferson Col- 
lege, College Point, Convent P. O. (Roman Catholic); St. Chatles College, Grand Coteau 
(Roman Catholic); Centenary College, Jackson (Methodist Episcopal South), and the 
following 4, all in New Orleans: College of the Immaculate Conception, also called The 
Jesuits’ College (Roman Catholic); Leland University (Baptist); New Orleans University 
(Methodist Episcopal); and Straight University (Congregational). The reports of some 
are not as definite as could be desired, but apparently all had arrangements for prepara- 
tory study in 1, 2, or more years’ courses, Jefferson not seeming to go beyond this in the 
year under review. The others all appear to have had substantially the usual classical 
collegiate courses, with a fair proportion of scientific studies, though these were not gener- 
ally arranged in separate courses. Jefferson, St. Charles, and the Immaculate Conception. 
College had also commercial courses; Leland, New Orleans, and Straight, normal instruc- 
tion, Straight having this arranged in a 3 years’ course, with a higher English course of 
the same length. Leland also had a similar course. 
For statistics of all these, see Table IX of the appendix; fora summary of these statistics, 
a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding; for professional 
courses, Professional Instruction, further on. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The 3 Protestant collegiate institutions in New Orleans—Leland, New Orleans, and 
Straight Universities—admit young women to equal privileges with young men. For 
information as to at least 4 other schools designed to afford to young women like advan- 
tages, see Table VIII of the appendix. 
State Superintendent Fay, in his report for 188081, urged on the legislature the es- 
tablishment of a first class college for young women, to correspond with the State uni- 
versity for young men in the educational advantages offered; but his recommendation does 
not appear to have met with favor.

90 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
College at Baton Rouge, a full description of which is given under Superior Instruction. 
St. Charles College and the University of Louisiana have scientific courses, and other 
colleges, as before stated, give some scientific instruction in connection with the classical, 
but not generally in defined and separate courses. . 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological.—Straight University (Congregational), for the education of the colored people, 
opened 1870, reported for 1880-81 a theological course of 3 years for college graduates, on 
completion of which they receive the degree of B. D. Students that have not had a col- 
lege education on leaving receive a certificate of the amount of their theological studies 
and the character and degree of scholarship attained. This department had 35 students 
and 1 graduate. There is no report from others heretofore reporting, except Leland Uni- 
versity, New Orleans, which had, according to the report of the Baptist Home Mission 
Society, 27 students for the ministry in 1881; while, according to the report of the Meth- 
odist Freedmen’s Aid Society, New Orleans University still gave theological instruction. 
For full statistics of schools of this class, see Table XI of the appendix. 
Legal.—The University of Louisiana and Straight University, both at New Orleans, 
give legal training in courses of 2 years of five months each, having each a faculty of 4 
instructors. The former in 1880-’81 had 35 students, the latter 20 and, graduated 9,.— 
(Return and catalogues. ) a 
For statistics of these and others reporting, see Table XII of the appéndix. 
Medical.—The medical department of the University of Louisiana (originally the 
Medical College of Touiiens) required in 1881, as previously, 3 yearsgof study with a 
regular practitioner, with attendance on two full courses of lectures of 20 weeks each 
year, and thorough hospital instruction, under 9 professors and instructors. During the 
session of 1880-’81 there were 204 students, 59 of whom graduated.— (Return and cata- 
logue.) For statistics, see Table XIII of the appendix. 
‘Whether New Orleans University continued in 1881 the 3 years’ course of medical 
lectures advertised by it in 1878 has not been ascertained at the date at which this 
goes to press. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
  EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Louisiana Institute for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Baton Rouge, for 
1880-81, reported 38 inmates, 22 being males and 16 females, under the care of a super- 
intendent, 2 teachers, and a matron and assistant matron. Inschool the pupils are trained 
in the branches usually taught in such institutions. The boys work 1 hour a day in cul- 
tivating the garden and chopping wood, while the girls are taught to sew and do general 
housework. System, order, and economy prevailed in every department. During the 
last 2 years the State had paid its usual appropriation of $10,000 in depreciated warrants, 
leaving the institution at the close of 1880-’81 with a debt of $3,000, which the general 
assembly would be called on to make good.— (Catalogue. ) 
No statistics for 1880—’81 of institutions for the training of the blind are at hand. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
The German Protestant Orphan Asylum, New Orleans, in 1880-’81 had 104 children, 
of whom 58 were boys and 46 girls, with 2 principal teachers, one for instruction in Ger- 
man, the other in English. In the morning the larger pupils are taught in English, the 
smaller in German, reversing this order in the afternoon; thus all are taught the ele- 
mentary branches in both languages. The girls are taught common sewing and knitting, 
and twice a week fine needlework by the English teacher, while in the afternoon the 
boys are taught drawing. Twice a week the older children meet in the evening and are 
taught vocal and instrumental music. The children are said to be remarkably healthy 
and are trained for usefulness in household work.— (Louisiana Journal of Education, 
January, 1881.) : 
; EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
A State educational convention was held at New Orleans May 23-26, 1872, the gov- 
ernor of the State presiding. The meeting was regarded as the initiative of similar ones 
in the future, but up to 1880-81 no further mention of them appears, nor of the local 
teachers’ associations recommended by general assembly of 1870, and they seem to have 
» been abandoned.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. ss a 
OFFICERS. 
For the State there is a superintendent of common schools, appointed by the governor 
and council for 3 years, who acts also as superintendent of State normal schools, : 
For each town (i. e., township) there is a superintending school committee of 3 mem- 
bers, or in its stead a supervisor of schools, elected by ballot at the annual meeting, to 
which offices no person is ineligible on account of sex: A school agent is annually elected 
by each town or district, to call school meetings, take the census of school children, pro- 
vide fuel, repair school-houses, &c.— (School law, 1881.) 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-370
  292 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The State offers free instruction in common English studies to all youth 4 to 24 years of 
age residing in school districts, and requires the attendance of all capable children be- 
tween 9 and 15 for at least 12 weeks in each year, unless instructed elsewhere. Parents 
and guardians of delinquent children are liable to a fine of $5 for each violation of this 
rule [and manufacturers have not been allowed to employ children without a teacher’s 
certificate that they have attended school 3 or 4 months the previous year; the penalty 
of $50 for such employment was made $100 in 1880].1_ A scheme for systematic graded 
instruction in primary and grammar schools was published for the use of the rural schools 
in 1881. Instruction in mechanical or industrial drawing, as well as in studies beyond 
the grammar grade, has been for some years optional. Normal schools for training teach- 
ers enter into the State system. Teachers must present a certificate as to moral charac- 
ter and fitness for the position from the officer who has examined them, and no teacher 
may receive his pay until the register of his school, properly filled up and signed, is de- 
posited with the school committee or its agent. Each teacher must include the Constitu- 
tien of the United States and that of the State of Maine in his instruction, with train- 
ing also in the principles of morality. The schools are supported from the interest of a 
permanent school fund, from taxes of 1 mill on $1 on ordinary property, of 23 mills? on 
$1 on deposits in savings banks, and from a tax of not less than 80 cents for each inhab- 
itant, to be annually voted by the school meeting.’ Failure to raise this last brings a 
penalty of twice to four times the amount of deficiency on the delinquent city, town, or 
plantation, with a forfeiture for the year of its portion of the State school money. Be- 
sides these required taxes, there may be others for free high schools, for the purchase of 
text books, and for building or repairing school-houses.— (School law, 1881.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
  The statistics given in the school report for 1881 show an increase of 240 in pupils en- 
rolled in public schools, notwithstanding a decrease in youth of school age, but a very 
marked and large decrease in the average attendance on both winter and summer schools; 
this, too, though 36 more districts than in 1880 made reports, and though there was a 
fair increase in school revenue, in the number of school-houses reported in good condi- 
tion, in the number of teachers employed, in the number of such who were graduates of 
‘ normal schools, and although the teachers received higher pay. The average length of 
school term was 2 days shorter. 
Superintendent Luce considers that there has been some gain in the quality of the 
schools, but deems it impossible to secure great improvement while the district system. 
prevails. He holds this system responsible for the short school term, small schools, poor 
teachers, lack of order, system, and school appliances, and large waste of ‘public moneys, and 
consequently wishes to see it superseded by a good. town system.— (School report, 1881. ) 
KINDERGARTEN. 
There has been decided growth in the Kindergirten at Lewiston. For statistics of 
schools of this class, see Table V of the appendix, and a corresponding table in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding.— (Returns. )

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Auburn reports 31 of its 32 school-houses in good condition; 1 erected during the year, at 
a cost of $900; school property valued at $89,000; and school terms averaging 1 day over 
10 weeks of 5} days each. A decrease is noted in enrolment and rate of average at- 
tendance.— (State report, 1881.) 
Augusta reports 30 of its 33 school buildings in good condition, 1 having been built dur- 
ing the year at a cost of $22,000; a school term of somewhat more than 11 weeks in 
summer and 14 weeks i» winter; 43 of the 48 teachers females, and 2.of the teachers 
graduates of normal schools. The return shows that a special teacher of music was em- 
ployed, but does not designate what grades received instruction.— (State report and city 
return, 1881.) 
Bangor had for the public schools 36 buildings, all in good condition, with 72 rooms 
and 3,500 sittings, valued at $75,000. Special instruction was given in vocal music and 
penmanship in all intermediate and grammar schools. Noteworthy changes were the 
extension of the school year from 32 to 34 weeks, the union of the grammar and high 
schools under one principal, the introduction of a uniform system of studies, and the 
establishment of a monthly teachers’ meeting, presided over by the committee. The 
school committee desires to establish an ungraded school for the benefit of working boys, 
who are employed in large numbers in shops and mills part of the year and are un- 
able to keep up with any specified grade.— (City report and return, 1881.) 
Bath reports 16 school-houses, 14 in good condition, with 37 rooms and 3,300 sittings, 
valued at $59,300. Schools were taught 190 days by 38 teachers, 2 of them graduates 
of normal schools. The classification is high, grammar, and primary, with ungraded 
rural schools. Drawing is taught in the primary schools; penmanship, in all schools, by 
a specialinstructor. The high school offers 3 parallel courses of study: an English course, 
with French and German; a classical course, including Latin, French, German, and the 
more important English studies; and a college preparatory course. In a class of 39 grad- 
uates, which was by far the largest number in any one year, 28 were girls.— (City report 
and return, 1881.) 
Biddeford reported 23 school-houses, 2 erected during the year, with sittings for 1,835 
pupils, valued, with sites and furniture, at $95,000. Schools were taught 184 days by 
10 male and 32 female teachers. An estimated enrolment of 269 in private schools was 
given for 1881.— (Return, 1881.) 
Lewiston, with a decrease in enrolment, reports an increase in daily attendance, the 
average per cent. being 94; 29 school-houses in good condition, with sites, furniture, &e., 
valued at $193,050 (1 built during the year at a cost of $4,278). The length of the school 
year was 374 weeks for city and 34} for rural schools, an injustice to the latter which the 
superintendent desires to see righted. The ungraded city school has been abandoned, an 
evening school meeting much better the wants of the class of pupils for whom it was in- 
tended. The normal practice school, which has been well conducted for several years, 
was very successful in 1881, a class of 8 young ladies, with nearly two hundred children, 
being in attendance: : 
A teachers’ library of professional books has been established from a donation of $50 
and 50 volumes. The teachers’ reports to the superintendent show the year to have been 
one of generally fair success.— (State and city reports and return, 1881.) 
Portland reported to the State superintendent 16 school buildings in good condition, 
1 erected during the ‘year at a cost of $20,000; entire school property valued at $350,000; 
and a school year of 363 weeks.— (State report, 1881.) : 
Rockland reports but 4 out of 11 school-houses in good condition, all valued. at $50,000; 
1 high school, 4 grammar, and 19 primary schools, with about seventeen hundred -sit- 
tings, in charge of 30 teachers, 2 of them graduates of normal schools.— (State report and 
city return, 1881.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL AND TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
The 3 State normal schools, at Castine, Farmington, and Gorham, reported for 1880-’81 
an attendance of 151 male and 261 female students, of whom 97 graduated and 83 engaged 
in teaching. They have all adopted a 2 years’ course of study, and Farmington has 
added a graduate course of 1 year, from which a class of 5 graduated at the close of the 
spring term. 
The Madawaska Training School, in its two sessions of 20 weeks each at Fort Kentand 
Van Buren, had an atteridance of 113, an increase of 17. A regular course of study was 
established, and 6 students were prepared to graduate in June, 1881. Of this class 4 were 
French, who learned to speak English fluently while in the school. 
The normal departments at Vassalboro’ and Pittsfield have been in successful opera- 
tion during the year, with an attendance of 92 in the former and 46 in the latter. At 
\ Pittsfield 4 were graduated. Of the 92 at Vassalboro’ 33 were teaching at the close of 
1881.
-P-A-G-E-372
94 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The normal training and practice class at Portland had 8 graduates, all of whom en- 
gaged inteaching. A similarschoolat Lewiston graduated 8, of whom 4 became teachers. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
By a resolution of the legislature the sum of $800 was appropriated for 1881 and a like 
sum for 1882 to enable the State superintendent to hold teachers’ meetings, one or more 
in each county,.during the year. They were to differ from former institutes in that they 
were to be conducted wholly by resident educators, to continue but 2 days each, and 
nothing was to be paid for the services of those conducting them—a provision likely to 
be fatal. 
The first meeting, which was successful in both attendance and interest, was at West 
Waterville in April, and an association was there formed under the new plan. In Octo- 
ber and November, 21 meetings were held, bringing into the work over 1,100 actual teach- 
ers and a considerable number of prospective ones. The work, while varied in form, was 
made practically uniform in substance, and has been satisfactory in its results. Twelve 
new teachers’ associations, in addition to 6 previously organized, owe their origin to these 
meetings. ‘ 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
FREE HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Free high schools have been supported in 101 towns, an increase of 15 over the pre- 
vious year, at a total expense of $69,469, the State paying only $16,910. There were reg- 
istered 7,792 pupils, with an average daily attendance of 5,592. The enrolment included 
595 persons engaged in teaching, being an increase of 210 such over the preceding year, 
which seems to indicate both a disposition on the part of teachers to improve their quali- 
fications and a demand for better qualified teachers in the common schools.— (State 
report, 1881.) 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and schools devoted to 
preparing students for college, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and for 
summaries of these statistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The institutions of this class in the State, excluding the State Agricultural College, 
continued to be 3 in number in 1880-81. 
Bowdoin College, Brunswick (Trinity Congregational), chartered in 1794, reports 14 pro- 
fessors and instructors and 146 students; one regular course, which gives liberal place 
to scientific studies and after the second year affords a wide range of electives, among 
which modern languages hold aprominent place. It has special departments of medicine, 
engineering, and military science. Facilities are also afforded students who desire to pur- 
sue graduate study. During the year ending July 1, 1881, gifts and bequests to the 
amount of $100,500 were received; also numerous additions to the library and art gallery. 
Colby University, Waterville (Baptist), reports a faculty of 9 members, with 149 stu- 
dents, a small number being young women. A slight change in the regular course of 
study was made by the establishment of a department of history. Three preparatory 
schools are controlled by the college. 
Bates College, Lewiston (Free Will Baptist), organized in 1857, reports a faculty of 7 
resident and 2 non-resident professors; 112 male and 15 female students; a library of 5,771 
volumes, which is increased yearly by a fund devoted to the purpose; and a gift of $1,000. 
A theological school and preparatory school of Latin are under the control of the college. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF, YOUNG WOMEN. 
For statistics of this class of institutions, see Table VIII of the appendix, and for a 
summary of their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Orono, organized in 
1868 and open to students of both sexes, offers 5 courses of instruction of 4 years each. 
They are essentially the same for the first 2 years, thus furnishing a necessary basis for 
the more technical studies and practical instruction of the ensuing years. The return 
gives 3 students in a graduate course, 4 in a partial course, and 95 males and 8 females in 
the regular courses. Heretofore tuition has been free. Since August, 1881, a charge of 
$30 a year is made.— (Return and catalogue, 1881.)

PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.—The Bangor Theological Seminary (Congregational), established in 1816, 
has sent out 600 graduates and instructed, without graduation, 160 more. A 3 years’ 
course of study, 5 professors, 25 students, and 10 graduates are reported for 1880-’81. 
A theological school connected with Bates College, Lewiston (Baptist), reports a 3 years? 
course, 6 professors, 17 students, and 6 graduates. Theological students are. admitted 
free to all scientific and other public lectures of the college. Both schools require a 
reliminary examination of candidates for admission who are not college graduates.— 
Catalogue and return, 1881.) 
No law school reports for 1881. 
Medicine.—The Medical School of Maine, under control of Bowdoin College, Bruns- 
wick, reports a medical faculty of 14 members and a corps of 103 students in 1880-’81. 
The requirements, as before, are 3 years of study, attendance on 2 lecture courses of only 
16 weeks each, a thesis, and the passage of an examination on all the studies of the 
course. This examination may be either full and final at the close or may be made at 
the conclusion of each lecture course on the subjects of that course. 
The Portland School for Medical Instruction, Portland, which is a high grade pre- 
paratory, not a graduating, school, reports 9 professors and 18 students. The physicians 
and surgeons of the Maine General Hospital at Portland, being members of the faculty, 
offer ample opportunity for clinical study of medical and surgical cases, allowing students 
to accompany them in their daily visits to the hospital. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF DEAF-MUTES, BLIND, AND FEBLE-MINDED. 
The Portland School for the Deaf, under control of the city school board, reports 4 
teachers and 26 pupils. The articulation method is successfully used in teaching the 
ordinary branches of a public school. The State permits parents to send their deaf 
children either to this school or to the American Asylum at Hartford, at the expense of 
the State.— (Return and city report, 1879.) 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Maine State Reform School, Cape Elizabeth, sends no information for 1881. 
The Maine Industrial School for Girls, Hallowell, reports the last year as one of prosper- 
ity. The girls have attended faithfully to their duties in school and work rooms, and 
the numbers have been equal to the capacity of the building. Clothing has been made 
for 60 girls and 150 pairs of stockings have been knit, the yarn being prepared by the 
girls.— (Annual report, 1881.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
MAINE PEDAGOGICAL SOCIETY. 
The Maine Pedagogical Society held its first annual meeting at Augusta, October 13-15, 
and was considered the most notable educational meeting ever held in the State. Rep- 
resentatives of all ranks of educational workers were in attendance. Among the topics 
discussed were ‘‘The nature and limits of government in colleges, seminaries, and public 
schools,’’ ‘‘ Value of honors and prizes,”’ ‘‘ Courses of study and daily programmes of work 
in rural schools,’’ ‘‘Moral education,’’ ‘‘Minimum length of schools,” ‘‘Text books,”’ 
&c. Important work was planned for the future: committees were appointed to investi- 
gate the whole subject of instruction in its several departments and instructed to report 
on the amount of work to be done in each in schools of different grades, on the character 
of text books, on methods to be pursued, &c. This society proposes to publish annually 
a volume containing the most valuable papers and reports presented during the year and 
a digest of the discussions thereon.— (State school report, 1881.) 
STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The Maine State Educational Association held its fifteenth annual session at Biddeford 
December 29-31. The State superintendent of public instruction made a report on the 
progress in educational matters during the year. The teaching of temperance in the 
schools was discussed, and a resolution was adopted favoring the use of free text books. 
Lewiston, Portland, and some other cities were said to have already introduced the 
“Temperance Book.’’ The frequerit change of teachers as a hindrance to progress was 
referred to, An excellent paper entitled “Style in teaching”’ was read by Superintend- 
ent Thomas Tash, of Portland, and discussed by Mr. W. E. Sheldon, editor of the Pri- 
mary Teacher, Boston. ‘‘Is there work for two educational associations in Maine?”’ was 
ably discussed; and it having been decided that one vigorous association could best 
secure the highest good, it was resolved that the records, funds, &c., of the State associ-

ation be passed over to the Maine Pedagogical,Society and no further meeting of this society 
be hereafter called. A paper ‘‘What is practical education?’ prepared by Mr. F. E. 
C. Robbins, of Deering, and in his absence read by his wife, was discussed by C. C. Rounds 
and others. The question ‘‘ What sciences shall we teach in high schools, and how shall 
we teach them ?’’ was presented by Mr. C. W. Fenn, of Gorham, and enthusiastically 
discussed by Superintendent Thomas Tash, of Portland, Miss Estelle Morris, of Farming- 
ton, and others. After the reading and discussion of some appropriate resolutions the 
association adjourned sine die.— (Journal of Education.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
Educational matters affecting the whole State are intrusted to a State board of educa- 
tion composed of the governor, 4 persons selected by him from the presidents and exam- 
iners of the county boards, and the principal of the State Normal School (for whites), 
who is ex officio secretary of the board and superintendent of public instruction. Edu- 
cational matters affecting counties are under the charge of county school commissioners 
(3 for ordinary counties, 5 for such as have more than 100 schools); these commissioners 
are appointed for 2 years’ terms by the judges of the circuit courts, and themselves appoint 
a person not of their number to serve as their secretary, treasurer, and examiner. Edu- 
cational matters affecting districts into which counties may be divided are given into the 
hands of 3 persons in each district, selected by the county school commissioners anzually. 
Baltimore City has a special board, for which see City School System, further on. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The moneys apportioned to the State free schools for whites come from the interest on 
. aschool fund of over $900,000, from a State tax of 1 mill on $1 annually levied, and from 
TE
-P-A-G-E-376
98 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
the product of certain fines, licenses, and intestate estates. The apportionment is based 
on the number of white youth i in each county and in the city of Baltimore from 5 to 20 
years of age, as determined by the last United States census. If this prove insufficient 
to sustain the schools for the legal period, an additional county tax not to exceed 1 mill 
on $1 may be levied. The schools for colored youth get the product of the State school 
tax on colored people, and since 1874 have received $100,000 annually additional from 
State funds. The income is distributed on the same basis as the above. Schools for 
colored children 6-20 years of age are by law to be opened by the county commissioners 
in each election district under the direction of a special board of school trustees appointed 
by the commissioners; and if they have an average attendance of not less than 15 scholars 
they are to be taught as long as the other public schools of the county, subject to the 
same rules as those for whites, and with instruction in the same branches. These 
branches include all ordinary school studies, classified under the rules of the State board. 
in 6 grades, and may reach up into high school or academic grades. Teachers’ institutes 
and a State normal school afford to the candidatts for positions as instructors in the 
schools for whites the means of scientific preparation for such work; and, where still 
higher preparation has been called for, the State, up to 1881 at least, has provided for it 
by allowances to certain colleges. To insure fair preparation in teachers for colored 
schools, a normal school for colored persons has been long ‘aided by the State, and no 
teacher, white or colored, may be employed in the free schools without a certificate of 
qualification from the county examiner, the principal of the State Normal School, or the 
State board of education, unless a diploma from the Normal School shall be presented 
showing that the candidate has graduated there. After employment reports must be 
made quarterly, according to law, before pay can be claimed for services. The boards 
- of county school commissioners determine and may purchase the text books for use in 
the county schools. These must contain nothing sectarian or partisan. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics for 1880—’81, as compared with 1879-’80, show a decrease of 3,522 in en- 
rolment, of 6,039 in average attendance, and of 3,293 in enrolment of colored pupils. 
There were 5 fewer éblored schools. In male teachers there was a loss of 11, while in 
females there was a gain of 66, a net gain of 55. In the teachers of colored schools there 
was a falling off of 14. Receipts for public schools were greater by $124,412 and expen- 
ditures by $60,214. The main difficulty in the way of improvement is the inadequacy 
of the school revenues. In 14 counties the schools were taught less than 10 months, and 
900 teachers were thrown out of employment, whose services could have been secured 
for the full school year by a small addition to their salaries. The census of 1880 reveals 
the presence in the State of 134,488 illiterates over 10 years of age, 90,172 of them being 
colored. Itis only since 1872 that, with an annual appropriation of $50,000, increased 
in 1874 to $100,000, schools have been opened for colored children where rooms could be 
obtained, only a few good houses having been built. ‘‘ Much,’’ says the superintendent, 
‘Chas yet to be done before this army of illiterates is driven entirely off the field. Nothing 
can be done without more money, and the people of Maryland, however willing, do not 
feel able to increase their taxes.’’ — (State report. ) 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For information in regard to these schools reporting in 1880-’81, see Table V of the 
appendix. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF BALTIMORE. 
OFFICERS. 
The public schools of the city of Baltimore are under the control of a board of school 
commissioners of 20 members, 1 from each city ward, appointed by the city council for 4 
years, 5 going out each year. The board elects annually a secretary, also a superintexud- 
ent and assistant superintendent of schools, each to serve 4 years. 
STATISTICS. 
The population ascertained by the United States census of 1880 was 332,313; youth of 
school age reported in 1881, 86,961; number enrolled, 47,048; average daily attendance, 
29;424; number of teachers, 824; expenditure for school purposes, $681,921. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
Baltimore reported in 1881, as under the care of the board, the Baltimore City College 
(which serves partly as a high school for boys), 2 female high schools, 39 grammar, 59 
primary, 5 public (formerly English-German), and 14 colored schools, 120 in all; and 
824 teachers employed, of whom 84 were men and 740 women: 13 in the Baltimore City
-P-A-G-E-377
  MARYLAND. 99 
College, 22 in the 2 high schools, 264 in the grammar, 81 in the public, 346 in the pri- 
mary, and 90 in the colored schools, besides 4 teachers of music and 4 of drawing. There 
were 543 pupils in the Baltimore City College November 20, and 818 within the year. 
Of the other white pupils there were 1,215 in the two girls’ high schools within the year, 
15,479 in the grammar, 4,334 in the public, and 22,979 in the primary schools. Of col- 
ored pupils there were 6, 303, 618 of these being in the colored grammar and 5,685 in the 
colored schools of lower ‘grades. The total number of different pupils during the year 
was 47,048, an increase over the preceding year of 333. The schools occupied 65 build- 
ings, 59 of which were owned by the city; 3 were used by high schools, 14 by grammar, 
25 by primary, 4 by public, 6 by grammar and primary schools jointly, 1 by colored 
grammar, and 6 by colored primary schools. All were valued, with grounds, furniture, 
and apparatus, at $1,730,000. 
On the whole, the ‘work of the schools during 1880-’81 was regarded as satisfactory; 
the board and superintendent had the codperation of the city authorities and the public; 
2 new buildings were erected and old ones repaired, furnishing facilities where most 
needed; attendance was increased; teachers worked with zeal and fidelity, and the stand- 
ard of free education was advanced. The Baltimore City College, in its 5 years’ course, 
continued to prepare its students for Johns Hopkins University. The high schools for 
girls, under a reduction of their studies, increased in the number, health, and efficiency 
of their pupils, and continue to enjoy the confidence and support of the people. The ad- 
dition of a sixth grade to the grammar schools proved highly beneficial. Special atten- 
tion was given to the grammar and primary schools. In the public schools (German— 
English), while the teachers of German had acquired greater proficiency in their work, 
the discipline and scholarship were satisfactory, and the applicants for admission exceeded. 
the accommodations. The colored schools were well sustained, under faithful and com- 
petentteachers. Several pupils in the grammar school completed the course and received. 
appointments in the colored schools in the counties. The 5 evening schools reported in 
187980 as closed for want of attendance were not reopened at date of last report; nor 
was the Saturday normal class, which was suspended last year with a view to reorgani- 
zation on a new basis.— (City report. ) 
.The census of 1880 returns 28,433 persons over 10 years of age unable to write in the 
city of Baltimore, which is 33 per cent. of its school population ae equal to 54 per cent. 
of its school enrolment.— (State report. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The members of the State board of education are ex officio trustees of the State Normal 
School at Baltimore. The school, organized in 1866, received $10,000 in 1880-’81 from. 
the State, that being $37.90 per capita of the enrolment. There were for the year 14 in- 
structors, 264 students, and 37 graduates, 25 of whom were teaching. Its course of study 
covered 3 years, including a model school; drawing and vocal and instrumental music 
enter into the course. Its certificates admit to teach in the State or city without exami- 
nation. In its students every county was represented, every seat was filled, and every 
graduate found immediate employment; of the 824 teachers in the State, 424 were 
Ternet in normal schools.— (State report and return. ) 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The Baltimore Normal School for the Education of Colored Teachers, organized in 1862, 
received, in 1880~’81, $2,000 from the State, and had 6 instructors, 145 students (22 of 
them normal), a 4 years’ course of study (including map drawing, vocal music, and pri- 
mary classes in a model school), and chee a tuition fee of $10 a year. Its library con- 
tained 1,010 volumes, increased by 190 during the year. The number of students was 
larger than in the previous year, and the school enjoyed the Ore of the colored 
people.— (Return and State report. ) 
The Normal Kindergarten Training School, under Anna W. perce reported in 1879- 
80, does not appear in reports for 1880-81. 
A training class for Kindergartners is reported in connection with the New Education 
School and Kindergarten in Baltimore, by the Misses French and Randolph, and another 
in connection with the female department of New Windsor College, New Windsor, under 
Mrs. J. I. B. Woodruff. The same college announced for 1880-81 instruction in didac- 
tics, with practical training in normal methods.— (Circulars. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The report of the board of education gives little information in regard to institute work 
for 1880-’81. The law requires one to be held in each county for 5 days every year 
under the county examiner, but the only reports are from the superintendent of Kent
-P-A-G-E-378
  e 
100 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
County, where a teachers’ institute was conducted by the principal of tne State Normal 
School and gave much useful information, and from the superintendent of Talbot County, 
who states that one was held at Oxford, at which every teacher but one was present, and 
also that one was opened for colored teachers and held 5 days.— (State report. ) 
The Cumberland Teachers’ Institute, a summer normal school for the teachers of Alle- 
gany County and the city of Cumberland, appears to have held its usual session, as $100 
were paid teachers for it; but no account of its work or attendance is given. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In the report of the State board of education for 1880-81 high schools are not mentioned; 
yet their presence in most of the Counties is indicated by the number of public school 
pupils reported as pursuing studies of a high school grade, as follows: In book-keeping, 
1,407; algebra, 2,532; philosophy, 2,361; drawing, 1,707; geometry, 1,152; physiology, 
1,928; Latin, 616; Greek, French, German, and music, 199. 
In the 3 high schools in Baltimore there was a total attendance of 2,033, an increase of 
627 over the previous year, and 35teachers. A reduction of studies in the girls’ high schools 
was beneficial; and it was hoped the same relief from too many studies would soon be 
‘given to the City College.— (City and State reports. ) 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Sixteen academies and academic schools (including the Maryland School for Deaf and 
Dumb), reported in 11 counties in 1880-’81, received from the State school fund $35,826 
and reported 42 teachers and 889 students, of whom 29 were studying Greek; 169, 
Latin; 29, French; 16, German; 185, algebra; 86, geometry; 16, trigonometry; 122, nat- 
ural philosophy; 27, chemistry; 77, physiology; 14, botany; 4, logic; 36, rhetoric; and 
70, English literature, all pupils in these studies being in the schools outside of that for 
the deaf and dumb. 
For full statistics of these and other academic schools reporting, also business colleges 
and preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix; 
for summaries of the same, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, receives various classes of students and pro- 
vides courses of study adapted to different vocations and special needs of individuals, 
classifying them as collegiate and university students. For the collegiate a rigid and 
high standard of matriculation is maintained, and instead of one curriculum which all 
are required to follow different combinations are offered ; from these the student, may 
choose, each combination being so arranged that at graduation every student will have 
been trained in advanced mathematics and a branch of science, Latin, German, French, 
and English, with some branches of historical and philosophical investigation; when he 
has passed the stated examinations, the degree of A. B. is conferred. 
University students are graduates of institutions of acknowledged standing who desire 
to prosecute advanced courses of literary and scientific work. To these the utmost facili- 
ties are accorded. They may be enrolled as candidates for the degree of PH. D.; and for 
their encouragement 20 competitive fellowships, with a salary of $500 each and free tii- 
tion, are annually awarded; and as an additional inducement 10 graduate scholarships 
were bestowed during the year. Besides these there are 20 ‘‘ Hopkins scholarships,’ 
giving free tuition to young men of promise who need aid. These were distributed among 
students from Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, and North Carolina. 
A course of studies has been arranged preliminary to a medical course; the students are 
classed as non-matriculates. Certain privileges have been extended to teachers following 
special courses, to medical students attending demonstrations in physiology, and to oth- 
ers admitted to the lectures in Hopkins Hall, but none of the above are enrolled as stu- 
dents. There were in 1880-’81 176 enrolled students, 102 of whom were graduates or 
university students, including 20 fellows, 37 matriculates or collegiate students, and 37 
non-matriculates, with 39 on the academic staff. 
Other institutions of this collegiate class reported for 1881 are St. John’s College, An- 
napolis; Baltimore City College, Baltimore; Washington College, Chestertown; Frederick 
College, Frederick; and New Windsor College, New Windsor (all non-sectarian); with 
Loyola College, Baltimore; Rock Hill and St. Charles Colleges, Ellicott City; Mount St. 
Mary’s College, Emmittsburg (Roman Catholic); and Western Maryland College, West- 
minster (Methodist Protestant). New Windsor comes now for the first time among the 
colleges, having previously presented itself as academic. All the 10 show arrangements   
 
-P-A-G-E-379
  MARYLAND. ) 101 
for instruction in studies preparatory to true collegiate work, and all present courses of 
classical collegiate study substantially of 3 or 4 years’ duration, except Frederick Col- 
lege, which indicates thorough work, but does not state clearly the time given to it. 
Only Rock Hill College presents a special scientific course, separate from the classical 
after the sophomore year; but St. John’s, Baltimore City College, Frederick, and New 
Windsor appear also to giye a fair proportion of scientific studies. St. John’s had a 
graduate course of 2 years preparatory to the degree of A. M.; Washington, a special or 
partial course for such as were not able to take a full one; New Windsor, arrangements 
for moral training; and Loyola, Rock Hill, Mount St. Mary’s, and New Windsor, com- 
mercial courses, that at Loyola covering 4 years, that at Rock Hill 2 years. New Wind- 
sor and Western Maryland Colleges receive young women as well as young men, but 
train them in separate departments and in shorter courses.— (Catalogues and returns. ) 
Under a law of 1872 St. John’s, Washington, Frederick, and Western Maryland Col- 
leges have received annual donations from the State, which in 1880-’81 amounted to 
$21,800. In return these colleges issue free scholarships, good for 4 years, to students 
selected by the county boards after competitive examinations, the holders being pledged. 
to.complete the full course of the college which they enter and to teach in the public 
schools of the State at least 2 years after graduation. In its report for 1880-’81 the State, 
board questions the wisdom of continuing these donations, and proposes the appointment 
by the legislature of a commission to examine the subject in all its bearings.    
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For information respecting the 4 or 5 schools for the higher education of women re- 
ported for 1881, see Table VIII of the appendix, and a summary of it in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
Music, drawing, painting, French, and German studies seem to enter into the courses 
ofall. Baltimore Female College and Lutherville College report apparatus and other 
means for illustrating study, and the same 2, with Frederick Female Seminary, under- 
take to instruct in Latin and Greek, of which the others make no mention.— (Catalogues 
and returns.) y 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The 3 schools for higher scientific training in this State are the Maryland Agricultural 
and Mechanical College, College Hill; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore; and United 
States Naval Academy, Annapolis. 
The Maryland Agricultural and Mechanical College reported for 1880—’81 a faculty of 7 
professors and 55 students, and continued to offer instruction in 7 departments of study, 
each course covering 4 years. The facilities in the agricultural department are a farm of 
286 acres, scientifically managed, vegetable, fruit, and flower gardens, with various cabi- 
nets, and a well arranged laboratory for chemical analysis. Instruction in military 
tactics is in the regular course. The degrees conferred are A. B., B. S., A. M., and bach- 
elor of agricultural science, this last conferred on students passing satisfactorily the course 
in agriculture. 
In the United States Naval Academy the students are classed as cadet midshipmen and 
cadet engineers. In 1880-81 there were 221 of the former and 104 of the latter. The 
training includes in the range of studies the higher mathematics, physics, astronomy, 
chemistry, mechanics, navigation, surveying, seamanship, gunnery, ordnance, drawing, 
modern languages, and such other branches as complete a literary and naval education. 
This course, which covers 4 years, is followed by 2 years at sea. The number of cadet 
midshipmen allowed is 1 for every Member and Delegate of the United States House of 
Representatives, 1 for the District of Columbia, and 10 appointed at large. 
Johns Hopkins University offers to graduate students large facilities for the most ad- 
vanced scientific studies, while to undergraduates it affords the scientific studies usual in 
collegiate courses. Students have the benefit of 3 scientific laboratories fully equipped 
for work in chemistry, physics, and biology, a branch of the last being worked in sum- 
mer at the seaside. The university library contains 10,000 volumes, and 6 other libra- 
ries in the city, containing 156,000 volumes, are readily accessible to the students. Uni- 
versity professors are free to give personal counsel and instruction, books and instruments 
for advanced work are provided, and instruction is imparted through such methods as 
will encourage students to become independent and original investigators. By the aban- 
donment of the class system, students who have had early advantages, with uncommon 
talent and good health, can push forward as rapidly as they please. Four associations, 
composed of the instructors and advanced students, have met monthly for the presenta- 
tion of scientific and literary papers. A naturalist field club made weekly excursions 
during the spring and autumn and held regular meetings for the reading and discussion 
of papers.— (Register for 1880-81.)

102 . REPORT OF THE. COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction continued to be given under Roman Catholic auspices in the 
following 4 institutions of the archdiocese of Baltimore: Theological Seminary of St. 
Sulpice and St. Mary’s, Baltimore; ecclesiastical department of Mount St. Mary’s, 
Emmittsburg; Scholasticate of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, chester; 
Philosophical and Theological House of Studies of Woodstock College, Woodstock; and 
under Methodist Episcopal auspices in the Centenary Biblical Institute, Baltimore, which 
is for the training of young colored men. In the former there was instruction in dog- 
matic and moral theology, canon law, church history, sacred eloquence, liturgic ceremo- 
nies, Gregorian chants, &c. In the latter the training was necessarily more rudimentary 
and less complete. In the first 4 mentioned 304 students were reported, in courses of 4 
to 7 years in length, under 27 instructors; in the last, 30 counted as theological, in a 
course that covered 2 preparatory years, 4 normal, and 3 theological, under 4 instructors.— 
(Reports and eines) 
Legal.—The Law School of the University of Maryland offers a course of 2 years of 34 
weeks each, requires an examination for admission, and confers the degree of bachelor of 
Jaws on those who attain 75 per cent. in examinations and submit satisfactory theses. Of 
the 60 students enrolled in 1880-81, 33 graduated and 30 had received degrees in letters 
or science.— (Return and catalogue. ) 
Medical.—The School of Medicine of the University of Maryland and the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons, both at’ Baltimore, were in 188081 the ‘‘regular’’ medical 
schools in the State, each presenting the usual 3 years of study and 2 of lectures,! each 
offering and recommending a 3 years’ graded course, but not requiring it. The former 
enrolled 191 students, under 24 instructors, and graduated 73; the latter, organized in 
1872, had 12 instructors, 360 students, and graduated 153.2— (Returns and catalogues.) 
Dental.—The Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, organized in 1839, claims to have 
been the first institution ofits kind in the world. During its history of 41 years, up to 
1880-81, 1,817 students had attended its annual sessions, and 1,085 had graduated. It 
presents a course covering 2 years of 22 weeks each, embracing the principles and prac- 
tice of dental science and surgery, anatomy, physiology and pathology, therapeutics and 
materia medica, chemistry, dental mechanism, metallungy, and infirmary practice. In 
1880-81 there were 11 instructors, 93 students, and 53 graduates. A new college built 
during the year is said to be the finest and best equipped building in the world devoted 
exclusively to dental instruction. The college extends relief to more than 2,000 charity 
patients every year. The session of 1880-81 is reported as the most prosperous in the 
history. of the college.— (Catalogue and return. ) 
Pharmacy.—The Maryland College of Pharmacy, Baltimore, continued in 1880-81 to 
require for graduation a thesis, attendance on 2 courses of lectures of 5 months each, with 
a course of analytical instruction and an apprenticeship of 4 years in the business.

appendix; for summaries of these statistics, corresponding tables in report of the Com- 
missioner preceding. 
  SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb, Frederick City, reported for 1881 an attend- 
ance of 90 pupils, of whom 52 were males and 38 females, under 10 experienced teachers; 
four to six years was the average time spent in the institution; and 248 deaf-mutes have 
been trained during the 14 years of its existence; 3 of its graduates are teaching in simi- 
Jar institutions. Such students as give promise of benefit from training in voice and lip 
culture are placed under the daily instruction of aspecial teacher. The common English 
branches, and in special cases the advanced studies, are taught, including drawing. The 
girls are instructed in sewing and housework; while the boys are trained in the cabinet, 
shoeshops, and printing officé.— (Catalogue and return.) 
The School for Colored Deaf and Dumb, Baltimore, was reported for the same year to be 
well established and thorough. It had 20 pupils under 10 instructors.— (Catalogue. ) 
F. Knapp’s Institute, Baltimore, a school for deaf and dumb opened in 1876, sends no 
report for 1880-’81. i 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Maryland Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Baltimore, reported for 1880-81 
the employment of 10 instructors, with 7 blind employés and workmen, and the attend- 
ance of 60 inmates; it has admitted 252 pupils since its foundation in 1853. In the 
school the primary, intermediate, and higher English branches were taught, and special

  instruction in vocal and instrumental music and piano tuning was given. In the indus- 
tries the pupils were taught broom and mattress making, chair caning, sewing, and house- 
work. There were 562 volumes in the library; school property was valued at $339,400.

INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The McDonogh Institute, Owing’s Mills, connects farm and garden work with its in- 
struction of poor boys of good character and fair capacity from the city of Baltimore. 
The school, organized under the will and from a bequest of the late John McDonogh, of 
New Orleans, a native of Baltimore, was established to educate in a farm school near 
Baltimore such boys as needed the advantages of education in connection with healthful 
industries and pure country air. The training given is meant, like that at Girard Col- 
lege, Philadelphia, to fit the subjects of it to fill respectable positions in almost any ordi- 
nary business. In 1880~’81 there were 50 boys under a principal, 3 instructors, and a 
matron.— (Report of trustees. ) 
St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys, Baltimore, established in 1866 as a reformatory in- 
stitution, had, in 1880-’81, 544 boys, 3 of whom were apprenticed, 88 returned to their 
parents or guardians, and 7 sent to St. James Home. Since its opening, 1,592 inmates 
had been taught some useful trade, receiving a sensible education and proper moral in- 
struction. The industries taught were printing, shoemaking, tailoring, carpentry, and 
blacksmith work, besides gardening, farming, baking, laundry, and general work of the 
house. Hundreds of the boys were earning a respectable living, filling positions of trust, 
and by their blameless character were an honor to their alma mater. 
The St. James Home, an annex to the above, opened in 1878, receives homeless boys, 
and during the 3 years of its work had furnished homes for 156. The inmates pay a cer- 
tain pro rata of their earnings, and the balance is deposited to their credit in a bank. 
During the year their wages amounted to $3,258.— (Annual report. ) 
INSTRUCTION IN ART. 
The Schools of Design of the Maryland Institute, Baltimore, are twofold: (1) The classes 
in mechanical and free hand drawing meet only at night and are open only to males. 
Since the reorganization of the school, with increased and improved material, the classes 
have been fully attended and the progress of the pupils marked. The teaching in this 
school is especially adapted to the needs of workers in the industrial arts. (2) The day 
schools, open to both sexes, are for the teaching of high art, so called in distinction from 
work in drawing given in the night schools.. For 1880-’81 these schools were reported as 
having a very large number of students and having done excellent work. A large num- 
ber of casts had been added to the apparatus, and classes formed in almost every depart- 
ment of art study.— (State report.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL COMMISSIONERS. 
The public school commissioners held their regular annual meeting November 29 and 
30, 1881, representing 19 counties and the city of Baltimore. After a free discussion of 
the school affairs of the State, resolutions were adopted recommending that the whole pro- 
ceeds of the public school tax of 10 cents on the $100 be given, as formerly, to the support 
of the white schools, and that an appropriation from the general treasury of not less than 
$100,000 be made, as formerly, for the colored schools; and as it had been found imprac- 
ticable to establish a high school in every county, as contemplated in the State school 
system, the county boards should arrange with the academies and private schools endowed 
by the State to receive such youth as desire a higher grade of instruction than can be had 
in the existing public schools.— (State report.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State board of education, one of its members a woman, has general charge of public 
school affairs; its executive officer is a secretary, who acts as State school superintendent 
and has agents to assist him in visiting the schools. There is also a State director 
of art education, who has supervision of drawing in the public schools of cities with 
10,000 or more inhabitants. Town school officers are committees of 3 members or some 
multiple of 3, elected by the people for 3 years; but in the few towns that had not abol- 
ished the district system in 1880-’81 there was a prudential committee of 1 for each dis- 
trict.!_ Cities and towns may by vote require their school committees to appoint super- 
intendents of public schools. 
No personis ineligible to serve on school committees by reason of sex; and it appears 
from the returns in 1881 that 98 women were serving on the school boards of 72 towns. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are sustained by local taxation and by the income of the Stateschool 
fund, one-half of which is for general educational purposes, the remainder for specific ap- 
propriations. Towns and cities cannot inany year receive their share of State funds un- 
less they have raised a school tax of at least $3 for each child therein 5 to15 years of age, 
provided and taught for6 months sufficient schools for all children of that age, and made 
provision for the enforcement of the truancy laws. If the inhabitants number over 
10,000, free schools (either day or evening) must also have been provided for the instruc- 
tion of youth over 15 in industrial or mechanical drawing; and in towns containing 500 
families a high school must have been established. Towns that fail to provide for the 
support of schools as required, not only lose their share of State funds, but also forfeit 
a sum equal totwicethe highest amountthey have ever voted for school purposes. ‘Towns 
neglecting to elect school committees forfeit from $500 to $1,000. The city council of any 
town may establish one or more industrial schools and raise and appropriate the money 
necessary to make them efiicient, and any town may establish additional day or evening 
schools for persons over 12. The system also comprises normal schools (including a nor- 
mal artschool), teachers’ institutes, a State agricultural college, truant and reform schools, 
and schools for the deaf and dumb, the blind, and the fecble-minded. Teachers must 
have certificates of qualification from school committees, and cannot receive pay unless 
they have made due report of school statistics. Committees must report annually to 
the secretary of the board. 
To secure for all youth in the State some measure of education, the law, since 1876, 
has forbidden the employment of children under 10 years of age in any manufacturing, 
mechanical, or mercantile establishment, as well as the employment, while the public 
schools are in session, of any child under 14 years of age who cannot read and write, un- 
less he has attended some school at least twenty weeks of the preceding school year ; 
while since 1878 no child under 14 who cannot read and write may be employed during 
the public school sessions. \ 
No discrimination is to be made in the schools as to race, color, or religious opinions, 
The Bible is to be read in them without note or comment, but no child may be made to 
read it in a version of which the parent or guardian disapproves. School committees 
choose the text books to be used and prescribe the courses of study to be pursued. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show that with only 5,359 more of legalschool age enumerated there was 
an increase of above 18,000 in the number of pupils enrolled in public schools. The 
enrolment exceeded the numbet of children of school age 5 to 15, from the fact that some 
who were under and many who were over the legal age attended. The average membership 
was slightly greater than during the previous year, though not enough to change percep- 
tibly the percentage of attendance based on it. In evening schools there was a greater 
average attendance, although the total number enrolled was slightly less. The number 
of public schools increased in fair proportion to that of the children needing them, and the 
average term increased one day. More teachers were employed by 266, all but one of | 
these being women. The average monthly pay of men was increased by $18; that of 
women, by $7.90; and the total public school expenditure, by $619,811. The same num- 
ber of public high schools were taught, but more pupils attended them and more teachers 
were employed in them. Fewer academies, private schools, and charitable institutions 
were reported, with fewer teachers and pupils. 
Among other evidences of popular interest in the schools noted in the report are the   
1Information has come that in 1882-83 the district system isto be superseded by the town system 
in all cases.

    106 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
amount of money raised for their support (which in 1880-’81 allowed $18.47 for every 
child of legalschool age), the large percentage of children attending, and the interest taken 
by public school teachers in preparing themselves for their work by study in normal 
schools and attendance on institutes and teachers’ associations. Institutes greatly mul- 
tiplied, and exercised a marked influence in improving public school attendance and 
courses of study. The school committee associations, new organizations that have 
sprung up within 4 years, and of which there were 9 in 1880, had been especially influ- 
ential. Courses of study have been marked out by them, the public mind has been 
awakened to the importance of securing a better attendance, and through their influence 
a county truant school was established, which it is hoped will soon lead to the estab- 
lishment of others. They have considered fhe necessity of securing trained teachers and 
of adapting methods of teaching to the minds of pupils, and have resolved to furnish the 
schools with more adequate means of teaching and study. They have approved of re- 
ducing the schools in the towns to the smallest number consistent with efficiency, and 
unanimously resolved in favor of placing over all the publicschools of the Commonwealth 
an educated superintendence. 
The necessity for additional supervision was demonstrated anew by the results of\ex- 
aminations into the condition of schools in Bristol and Franklin Counties. The two 
_ agents of the board, Mr. E. A. Hubbard and Mr. George A. Walton, conducted these ex- . 
aminations in accordance with a plan agreed upon, embracing everything affecting the 
character and condition of the schools. The conclusion drawn from them and from ex- 
aminations made of schools in Norfolk County the year before was that there was an im- 
perative demand for an addition to the school forces which shall have for its province a 
systematic and constant direction of all school affairs. This want has been met in cer- 
tain portions of the State by a union of two or more towns into one district for the pur- 
pose of employing a superintendent, a school law of 1870 having authorized such action. 
‘Two districts have been formed and the union superintendents over them are doing a 
good work. It is believed that if all the smaller towns of the State could be united into 
convenient districts for supervision, the conditions of good schools would be supplied. 
The secretary reports that in 72 towns 98 women were serving efficiently on school 
committees, and says it is the uniform testimony of the agents of the board that wherever 
women are thus‘employed school affairs are in a progressive condition. 
PROGRESS UNDER THE STATE BOARD. 
Since the organization of the board of education in 1837 a uniform system of State 
schools has been created, a comprehensive plan of collecting accurate school statistics has 
been established, 6 State normal schools for the professional training of teachers have 
been organized, and methods of teaching have been very much improved. Jn addition to 
these changes, laws have been passed for the use of a uniform method of selecting and ex- 
amining teachers; establishing uniform courses of studies for the different grades of schools 
and a minimum time of attendance by pupils; requiring drawing to be taught as a prepa- 
ration for industrial occupations in towns and cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, 
and permitting it in smaller places; organizing a normal art school for the preparation of 
teachers in this branch of study, and placing over it a skilled director from one of the 
best and most practical of foreign schools. In 1846 and 1878, on the recommendation of 
the board, the successive compulsory school laws that have secured to children their right 
to a fair minimum of education were passed, and since 1873 laws have existed obliging 
towns and cities to make all needful provisions for repressing truancy, including the estab- 
lishment of schools for truants. To lessen the expense of these schools, 3 or more towns 
were allowed from the first to require of their county commissioners the opening of such 
schools, and in 1881 counties to the number of 2 or 3 were allowed to unite for a like 
purpose. These things, with others, have rounded out the State school system to pro- 
portions that, if not complete, are more nearly so than those of any other State.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Attleborough reports an increase of 187 in youth of school age, of 124 in the number en- 
rolled in public schools, and of 71 inaveragedaily attendance. There were 2 publichigh 
schools, with 89 pupils, and 1 private school, with 25 pupils.— (State report. ) 
Beverly had 53-more youth of school age, 26 more enumerated, a decrease of 2 in aver- 
age attendance and in teachers employed, 1 high school with 138 pupils, and 2 private 
schools with 50 attending.— (State report. ) . 
In Boston the statistics show fewer children of legal school age than in 187980, a 
larger number of public pupils enrolled, and a smaller average daily attendance. The 
public school system comprised, as before, primary, grammar, high, and evening schools 
(including an evening high and 6 evening drawing schools), a normal school, the Horace 
Mann School for the Deaf, and 2 schools for licensed minors. \ 
Among the important modifications in methods of government and instruction made 
during the past few years the committee note the organization of the board of super- 
visors, the use of reading supplementary to that‘in the school books, and certain changes 
in the conduct of the primary schools. The board of supervisors was appointed to sup- 
plya need felt for morethoroughsupervision. Amongother duties itis to examine candi- 
dates for teaching, to visit eyery school, note the work of each teacher, keep a careful eye 
on the sanitary state of school buildings, and have entire control of the primary schools, 
which were formerly under the supervision of the grammar masters. Great advantage 
has resulted from the use of supplementary reading from the Public Library and other 
sources, in connection with the text books on reading, and from exercises in the schools 
on the reading thus gone over, and it is believed that with a more judicious selection of 
books and a more systematic use of them even better results will be secured. In 
the primary schools there has been an important change in the methods of government, 
direction rather than repression being the new rule. Kindergarten methods find a place 
in the lower classes. The use of books printed in the Leigh phonic type has been discon- 
tinued, not from any dissatisfaction with the type, but because the present method of 
teaching (by the form of words rather than the spelling) does not require its use.

108 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  The large per capita cost of instruction in this city as compared with others is ex- 
plained partly on the ground that a greater proportion of the pupils here were in the 
higher or more costly grades. The average expenditure on a primary scholar was $18.45; 
on a grammar scholar, $28.20; and on pupils in high and normal schools, $87.42. Only 
40 per cent. of the school population were in primary schools, while 54 per cent. were in 
grammar and high. An effort was made during the year to reduce expenditures by dis- 
continuing one or more of the suburban high schools and drawing their pupils into the 
central school, but the project met with strenuous opposition from leading citizens and 
had to be abandoned for a time at least. : 
The committee on sewing in the public schools report great improvement in the char- 
acter and quality of the work done and increasing evidence of the practical value of the 
instruction. The school committee has again repeated its formal vote of desire to test 
the feasibility of imparting to grammar scholars some of the elements of mechanical skill. © 
They think the success of sewing in the girls’ schools has proved that it is possible to do 
this without interfering with the established routine of study. 
The normal school, sustained by the city for the purpose of giving professional in- 
struction to young women intending to teach in the city schools, and chiefly to high

schools had 184 pupils attending; the 5 evening drawing schools, 170; the high school, 
601. Two private schools are reported, with 1,400 pupils. Music and drawing form a 
part of the course in all the public schools, and specialists are employed to teach them. 
New school-houses were provided during the year, making the accommodations, for the 
first time in the history of the schools, about equal to the demand. The high school 
graduated 80 pupils (51 girls and 29 boys), the largest class ever sent out. The plan 
for admission to evening schools adopted the previous year (requiring of each pupil a de- 
posit of $1, to be forfeited in case of irregular attendance) was continued, and its ex- 
cellence still further demonstrated.— (State and city reports. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Five State normal schools (besides the State Normal Art School at Boston) form a part 
of the public school system of Massachusetts. Situated respectively at Bridgewater, 
Framingham, Salem, Westfield, and Worcester, they had a total of 836 students attend- 
ing in 1880-’81 and graduated 184. The secretary of the State board reports a prosperous 
condition in all, and that the demand for trained teachers is constantly increasing as 
people obtain more adequate and definite ideas of what good teaching is.. The board of 
education considers it certain that the influence of these schools is felt to an increasing 
extent in the elevation of the standard of capacity and fitness to teach, and regrets that 
larger numbers do not share the advantages offered for professional training. Of more 
than 8,000 teachers employed in the public schools during 1880-’81 only'2,236 had gbeen. 
fitted in normal schools. 
The Bridgewater school has had a steady growth in prosperity and usefulness since 
its organization in 1840. During 1880-’81 there were 174 students attending (50 men 
and 124 women), and 52 were graduated \(18 men and 34 women). Gratifying reports of 
the success of such graduates in their school work are often received, and more demands 
for well trained teachers are received than can be filled from the graduating classes. 
The courses for graduation continued to be two, one of two years and one of four. Out 
of means furnished by the legislature in 1880 a new laboratory building (32 by 64 feet, 
two stories in height, and supplied with ample appliances for instruction in chemistry 
and physics) was erected for use in 1881-’82, adding greatly to previous advantages.
-P-A-G-E-389
  
  _ MASSACHUSETTS, 111 
The school at Framingham was reported by the visitors to be in a satisfactory condition, 
with 112 pupils (all women) and 33 graduates. There was an improvement in the prepa- 
ration of pupils entering. A permanent teacher was appointed in the department of his- 
tory and literature. The course of study covered 2 years. 
At the Salem school more attention than usual was given to drawing, a large amount 
of practical work was done in physics and chemistry, and there was an especially thor- 
ough course in the English language. The attendance for 1880-81 was 263; graduates 
for the year, 58. There were two courses of study, one of 2 and one of 4 years, with a 
library to aid study and investigation. Nearly all the graduates find opportunity to 
teach. 
Westfield had an attendance of 120 (men 11, women 109), and sent out 25 graduates, 
23 of themwomen. There were two courses of study, of 2 and 4 years respectively. The 
graduates of the previous year were all but 3 known to have secured schools and to have 
taught satisfactorily. By the reports sent in of graduates’ work, it appears that school 
committees are more inclined than formerly to allow professionally trained teachers to 
use their own methods, holding them responsible only for results. 
The Worcester school had 167 pupils (all but 5 women), and graduated 16 (2 men and 
14 women). A constantly increasing demand for graduates as teachers is reported, and 
the testimony to their success is almost uniform. The course of study covers 2 years; but 
after a year’s study pupils are allowed to serve as apprentices in the public schools of the 
city under conditions involving real responsibility. This term of apprenticeship has 
been recently extended to 6 months; on its completion, pupils return to the school for 
another year of study, making thewhole term two years and a half. Almost all the 
pupils elect this longer course, and so graduate with more maturity and skill than would 
otherwise be the case. 
The Normal Art School, Boston, in 1880-’81, gave instruction to 294 pupils, of whom 
222 were in day classes (48 men and 179 women) and 72 were in evening classes (32 
women and 40 men). Certificates were given to 54 and diplomas as art masters and 
mistresses to5. Among other work accomplished by this school is the introduction of a 
uniform course of practice in drawing and teaching eavang in the other State normal 
schools. ‘With the codperation of principals and special teachers of these schools, such a 
course was arranged by Art Director Walter Smith, and put in operation in September, 
1881. He says the grading of drawing in day schools has made more apparent the char- 
acter of that which should be taught in normal schools; and the better preparation in 
drawing which normal school pupils now possess has made the adoption of this course pos- 
sible. Mr. Smith says the success of the free evening drawing schools throughout the 
State has been hindered by a lack of teachers having sufficient training and experience, 
a want which is being gradually supplied by the Normal Art School. Another great 
hindrance was the absence of a systematic plan of study. To the latter he ascribes 
chiefly the lack of interest in these classes and irregularity of attendanceon them. These 
hindrances, he says, have been overcome in the Boston schools since the adoption of a defi- 
nite course of study, which went into operation in the fall of 1880; and he is satisfied 
that similar measures would be as effectual elsewhere. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Boston Normal School gives a professional course of one year to young women who 
intend to teach in the city schools, tuition being free to residents. Graduates are eligi- 
ble to appointment in the city schools without further examination. There is a graduate 
course of one year for further study of the principles of education and for observation and 
practice in teaching. Pupils belonging to it may be employed as substitutes or as tem- 
porary or permanent teachers. The training or practice school numbers over a thousand 
pupils of primary and grammar grades. During the year 1880~’81 there were 69 normal 
pupils in attendance and 38 were graduated. 
Normal training schools, as before mentioned, are sustained by the public school au- 
thorities of Cambridge, Gloucester, Lawrence, and Fall River, the last having been opened 
in 1881. 
At Wellesley College a normal departmentis provided for the benefit of women who are 
teachers but desire opportunity for advanced study. The course was enlarged in the 
autumn of 1881 by the addition of English literature, American history, and Anglo-Saxon. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Twenty-one institutes for teachers were held during the year and were attended by 
2,276 teachers. The interest shown in them by teachers and by the public continued to 
increase. In the opinion of the State board it is desirable that a larger number should 
be held and that in some cases the length of sessions should be increased, and for this, as 
well as other reasons, the appointment of additional agents is urged. For the last few 
j

years the institutes have diminished in length and increased in number, this plan having 
been found moré economical. They arenow continued fortwo orthreedaysonly. The day 
sessions are devoted to illustrative lessons on the best method of teaching the branches 
which the statutes requite the public schools to teach; and the evenings to lectures de- 
signed to interest the people in popular education, opportunity also being offered for a dis- 
cussion by the people, as well as by committees and teachers, of educational topics hav- 
ing either a general or local interest. Great_good, it is believed, resulted from the year’s 
institutes. The exercises were judiciously prepared, instructors carefully chosen, mem- 
bers prompt in attendance and earnest in endeavors to improve; while school commit- 
tees codperated cordially and citizens were most hospitable.— (State report.) 
SCHOOL COMMITTEE ASSOCIATIONS. 
Many of these means for consultation as to improvement of teaching and school work 
, are reported to have been held in 1880-81, and the members of the associations are said 
to have entered with life and spirit upon a discussion of the agencies for such improve- 
ment. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Journal of Education, a Boston weekly of great value for its discussion of current 
educational topics and its full news reports of school matters, was in its thirteenth and 
fourteenth volumes in 1881; the Primary Teacher, from the same office, in its fifth; Edu- 
cation, a bimonthly review of important school questions, under the same general edi- 
torship, in its second; while Good Times, designed to aid in getting up attractive and 
useful school exercises, came still from the same press with the other three, and reached 
the conclusion of its fourth volume in September, 1881, under the hands of its original 
editor, Mrs. M. B. C. Slade. Hon. Thomas W. Bicknell, former State school commis- 
sioner of Rhode Island, presided over and directed all these publications, with the aid of 
several competent assistants. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
There are now in the Commonwealth 215 public high schools, furnishing an opportu- 
nity to over 90 per cent. of the entire population of the State to obtain for their children 
a good secondary education. The total number of pupils attending was 18,900; teachers, 
595. About forty towns that have less than 500 families, and that are, therefore, not 
obliged by law to sustain high schools, do so voluntarily. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and collegiate preparatory 
schools, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and for summaries of them, the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION.   COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Seven colleges and universities, all but one exclusively for men, reported a total of 
1,733 undergraduate students during 1880-’81 (a slight decrease during the year), and a 
thousand more engaged in professional and other studies, not counting preparatory stu- 
dents. Noné of these institutions do any preparatory work, except Boston College, Bos- 
ton, and the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, each of which presented a course of 
study extending over 7 years, 3 or more of them being evidently preparatory and 
the remainder embracing the usual studies of a classical course in Roman Catholic col- 
leges. All the others provided the regular classical course of 4 years; Amherst and Har- 
vard offered also scientific courses; Boston University and Tufts College, philosophical 
courses of like length, Tufts adding an engineering course of 3 to 4 years. All these 
presented graduate courses beyond the undergraduate in several departments of study; 
and of the four, all but Amherst had professional courses, which will appear in Profes- 
sional Instruction, further on.— (Catalogues, year books, and returns. ) 
Harvard University comprehends the college, the divinity, law, medical, and dental 
schools, the Lawrence Scientific School, the museum of comparative zodlogy, the Bussey 
Institution (a school of agriculture), the college library, the astronomical observatory, 
and the Peabody Museum of American Archeology and Ethnology. The number of 
students in all departments in 1880-’81 was 1,382; of teachers, 161. The collegiate de- 
partment enrolled 823 in regular classes (a slight increase during the year), besides 34 
unmatriculated students. Eight young women passed the preliminary examination for
-P-A-G-E-391

the private collegiate course, and 9 the advanced examination. A gift was received from 
T. J. Coolidge, esq., of $100,000, its income to go towards the cost of administering the 
library; and one of $30,000 came from Mrs. Samuel Hooper, for the Sturgis Hooper pro- 
fessorship of geology. Prof. J. D. Whitney also gave his geological and geographical 
library. The fund for the endowment of the botanic garden was increased by about 
$20,000. A friend of the university offered to build a physical laboratory, to cost $115,000, 
provided a permanent fund of $75,000 were raised, the income to be applied to its run- 
ning expenses. At date of the report, $30,000 of the required sum had been obtained. 
With all these general indications of prosperty, it is stated that the financial condition 
of the college proper gives much concern to the corporation; that the college has been 
living beyond its income for four years to the average amount of $12,500 a year, owing 
to expenditures for improvements and to a fall in interest on invested funds. The gift 
to the library relieves this condition considerably, lessening the deficit by the whole 
amount of the income it will yield ($4,000), while some retrenchments were to be made 
and an increase of fees from students was looked for. A plan adopted in June, 1881, of 
having simultaneous examinations for admission in Exeter, N. H., New York City, 
Philadelphia, Chicago, Cincinnati, and San Francisco, had already resulted in an increase 
of students from the States in which those cities are situated. 
The revised regulations for college government (in the line of greater freedom), adopted 
in 1879—’80, had worked well and were likely to remain in force. An effort was made 
during the year, by a circular of inquiry sent to parents of undergraduates, to ascertain 
how much support morning prayers at college had in the ‘habits of families from which 
students came. Of '741 persons that replied, two-sevenths held family prayers and five- 
sevenths did not; but of those that did, 9 expressed a desire that attendance on prayers 
at college should be voluntary, while of those that did not 36 approved of compulsory 
attendance. 
Experience during the last ten years indicates that the elective system does not tend to 
the extinction of the studies called liberal, because these, though taken by a smaller 
proportion of students than formerly, are pursued with greater vigor and to better pur- 
pose. It appears, too, that the scientific turn of mind is comparatively rare among the 
young men who enter, a large majority preferring languages, metaphysics, history, and 
political science to mathematics, physics, zodlogy, and botany.— (Catalogue and presi- 
dent’s report.) 
Boston University, Boston (Methodist Episcopal), the youngest of the institutions before 
mentioned, and the only one of them which admits both sexes, had during the year 107 
students (70 men and 37 women) in its college of liberal arts. Besides this collegiate 
department, the curriculum of the university embraces a college of music and schools of 
theology, law, medicine, and of allsciences.1 The last, which had 45 studentsin 1880-’81, 
is for graduate instruction, and offers facilities for the study of modern languages and 
their literatures, natural and mathematical sciences, and theological, legal, medical, his- 
torical, and art studies. The college of music, intended for graduates of American con- 
servatories and other advanced students, claims to be the only one of its grade and kind in 
America. It presents distinct courses for vocalists, pianists, organists, and orchestral 
performers, covering in mos cases 3 years. The degree of bachelor of music is given 
graduates who specially distinguish themselves by their talents, if graduates of any col- 
Jege of arts or if able to pass an examination in English composition, history, and litera- 
ture, a modern language and Latin, or two modern languages and mathematics. Pupils 
may be admitted to all classes in the college of liberal arts for which they are sufficiently 
prepared. 
Amherst College, Amherst (Congregational), reported 337 pupils in undergraduate courses 
of study (329 in classical and 8 in scientific) and 2 graduate students. Physical exercise 
in the gymnasium is required, and attention to it is taken into account in determining 
the standing of students. The professor in this department is a physician, who is expected 
to be acquainted with the physical condition of each student and to do his best to make 
that condition good. 
Tufts College, Medford (Universalist), reports a decided increase of interest among the 
friends of the college. The number of students, which fell off somewhat during the 
period of financial distress, had begun to increase. More than three-fourths of the sum 
sought for endowment by the trustees ($150,000) had been pledged, and there was reason 
to believe that the whole amount would be forthcoming. Through the generosity of a 
friend arrangements were made for the erection of a chapel for the college, which would 
probably be completed in 1882.— (Catalogue, 1881. ) 
Williams College, Williamstown (Congregational), received $17,000 during the year, $5,000 
of it being a bequest from the estate of Judge James L. Rice, of Iowa, given for Greek 
and Latin prizes; the remainder in varying sums from other friends.— (Return. )

INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
Of ten academic and collegiate institutions thus classed, reporting for 1880-81, only 
two, Smith and Wellesley Colleges, were authorized to confer collegiate degrees. Of nine 
that gave statistics, eight had altogether about a thousand students in collegiate classes, 
while in one the pupils (numbering '70) were unclassified. Nearly all these institutions 
give instruction in Latin and the modern languages, in music, drawing, and painting, a 
majority presenting Greek as an optional study. Most of them make provision for phys- 
ical training in gymnastic or calisthenic exercises. _At Lasell Seminary, Auburndale, 
special care is given to the health of students and to their mode of dress from a hygienic 
standpoint. Another feature of this school is a work department embracing cookery, 
dress cutting, millinery, china painting. and art needle work. 
In Wellesley College, Wellesley (one of the two having full collegiate rank), the trustees 
have determined to admit candidates for matriculation on the certificates of the teachers 
who prepare them. During the year this college received gifts to the amount of $140,500. 
Mrs. Valeria Stone, of Malden, Massachusetts, gave $110,000 for the erection of Stone 
Hall, which was to be opened in September, 1881, and to furnish dormitories for about 
100 normal students; Mr. Henry F. Durant gave $25,500 for a building for the college 
of music, to contain thirty-eight rooms properly furnished for teaching and practice, with 
a hall for choral singing. The music department was thus afforded an opportunity for 
reorganization and great enlargement, and is now enabled to offer an excellent oppor- 
tunity for obtaining at the same time a collegiate and musical education. The teachers’ 
course was also enlarged, as mentioned under Other Normal Training, page 111. _ Certifi- 
cated teachers may enter without examination, and may take any course they desire in 
the college classes. 
Smith College, Northampton, with a full collegiate course, in which musical and artistic 
studies have a place, reports special attention given to religious, social, and physical eult- 
ure. A gift of $35,000 from Winthrop Hillyer, esq., of Northampton, provided an art 
gallery and collection. The building is large and commodious, and contains studios and 
exhibition rooms sufficient for all present needs. 
Mt. Holyoke Seminary, South Hadley, received gifts amounting to $15,600, of which 
$10,000 were from A. Lyman Williston, esq., of Northampton, for an observatory. ‘The 
building was completed in June, 1881. It contains a new telescope with an eight inch 
object glass, a transit instrument, astronomical clock, and other appliances. Though 
not claiming collegiate rank, this seminary presents a very thorough four years’ course, 
embracing the Latin and modern languages, with Greek optional. A special feature here 
is that each pupil devotes a certain part of the time to domestic labor.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Massachusetts Agricultural College, Amherst; the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology, Boston; the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science, Worcester; the 
Lawrence Scientifie School and the Bussey Institution of Harvard University, and the Bos- 
ton University School of all Sciences report an aggregate of nearly 400 students in regular 
undergraduate courses, besides over 200 in special, partial, and graduate courses, in the 
last being included the 45 students belonging to the Boston University School of All 
Sciences, which makes provision only for graduate instruction. _The Massachusetts Agri- 
cultural College, in a 4 years’ course, and Bussey Institution, in one of 3 years, devote 
special attention to training in agriculture; the Worcester Institute, with courses of 3 and 
+ years, and the Institute of Technology, with a variety of 4 years’ courses, prepare for 
other industries based on the sciences. In the last, named, out of 10 courses, 5 are of 
distinctly professional character, embracing civil, mechanical, and mining engineering, 
architecture, and chemistry. Manual instruction is also provided for those who wish to 
enter on industrial pursuits rather than to become scientific engineers, the shop work em- 
bracing carpentry and other erafts in wood, pattern making, foundery work, iron forging, 
vise work, and machine and tool work. The Worcester Institute offers a 3 years’ course 
leading to the degree of B. S. in the various branches of applied science, with classes in 
shop work requiring an additional half year. The institute during 1880-’81 was given 
$34,500 in cash by David Whitcomb, Stephen Salisbury, and Joseph H. Walker, most 
of it intended for additions to the machine shop and for the necessary increase in its run- 
ning expenses. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology received a gift of $12,380, of 
which $10,000 were a legacy from Nathaniel C. Nash, esq., the remainder being in small.

tinuance of free scholarships. Lack of funds has been from the first a great obstacle to 
usefulness here. A plan for increasing the endowment was adopted in June, 1881, by a 
joint convention of the trustees and the State Board of Agriculture. The increased mem- 
bership which followed the offer of free tuition in 1879 showed that the college was ap- 
preciated by a large proportion of the farming population. In the Bussey Institution the 
results of agricultural instruction were far from encouraging. With 6 competent teach- 
ers, a good supply of the necessary appliances and collections, and tuition remitted to 
needy students, only 6 on an average have belonged to the school each year. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Seven theological schools representing 6 different denominations and one claiming to 
be non-sectarian reported for 1880-81 a total of more than 250 undergraduate students, be- 
sides a number in special or partial courses. In 4 of these schools there were 93 students 
(out of a total of 171) who had received degrees in letters orscience. All but 1 required 
an examination for admission of students not presenting evidence of good literary quali- 
fications, the exception being the New Church Theological School, Waltham (Swedenbor- 
gian). 
The Divinity School of Harvard University (non-sectarian) received during the year 
$10,775, the result of a subscription for endowment begun in 1879. The constitution of 
this school prescribes that ‘‘ every encouragement be given to the serious, impartial, and 
unbiassed investigation of Christian truth, and that no assent to the peculiarities of any 
denomination of Christians shall be required either of the instructors or students.’”? Stu- 
dents of the Boston University Theological School (Methodist Episcopal) may attend any 
class in the college of liberal arts of that university, and may prolong the 3 years’ theo- 
logical course to 4 without extra charge for tuition, room rent during the last year being 
also remitted. The Episcopal Theological School, Cambridge, offers its students free tui- 
tion and the use of rooms. Andover Theological Seminary (Congregational) reports 14 
students in a fourth year which has been added for advanced study. Tufts College Di- 
vinity School, Medford (Universalist), besides its regular 3 years’ course intended for col- 
lege graduates, has one of 4 years for such as have not been thus prepared. Newton 
Theological Institute, Newton Centre (Baptist), received during the year a gift of 10 
scholarships of $1,000 each. 
For statistics of theological schools, see Table XI of the appendix, and for a summary, 
see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal instruction was given in 2 schools belonging to Harvard and Boston Universities 
to about 300 students in 3 years’ courses, an examination for admission of non-graduates 
being required in both cases. 
‘The Law School of Harvard University is to have anew building, for which $100,000 have 
been given by a friend who, for the present, withholds his name. Another urgent need 
is an additional professor; but the income from tuition fees and the small endowment are 
not sufficient to provide for this. Number of students, 151; of professors, 4. 
‘The Boston University School of Law reported a prosperous year, indications of healthy 
growth, the quality of ‘students improved, and the number up to the average, notwith- 
standing recent advances in tuition. Among the graduates cum laude was a young 
woman, the first of her sex to cémplete the course. A certain public and historic inter- 
est attaches to this graduation, as it led to the first application in Massachusetts on the 
part of a woman for admission to the bar and to a decision by Chief-Justice Gray that 
the laws of the State, as they stood in 1881, did not authorize such admission. 
For statistics of law schools, see Table XII of the appendix, and for a summary, see 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Three medical schools, 2 ‘‘ regular’? and 1 homeeopathie, report a total of 373 students 
during 1880-81. 
The Medical School of Harvard University (regular) requires a 3 years’ graded course 
of study and presents an optional course of 4 years, that of each year extending over 9 
months. To graduates of the longer course is given the degree of doctor of medicine 
cum laude if they have obtained an average of 75 per cent. on all the examinations. 
Number of students in the 4 classes, 243; resident graduates, 8. Work had been begun 
on a new building for the school, which was expected to be ready for use in January, 
1883. Funds for this work were subscribed in 1874-75, but the sum remaining after 
purchase of the lot was insufficient for its completion; the medical faculty therefore dur- 
ing the year undertook to raise a subscription for it, and succeeded in obtaining $103,720. 
In 1871 this school ceased to be in any sense a private venture and became a constituent 
department of the university, devoted, like the other departments, to the advancement 
of learning. Since that year it has received by gift and bequest $270,000. A much 
greater sum is urgently needed to endow chairs and establish scholarships. 
The College of Physicians and Surgeons, Boston, a ‘‘regular’’ medical school organized 
in 1880, admits both sexes, and had during its first year 23 students under 15 professors

and instructors. Its course is the old one of 3 years, which requires attendance on only 
2 courses of lectures (but these must be of 38 weeks each) and a previous year of medical 
study. There is, however, a graded course of 3 years, which is obligatory for all who have 
not previously studied medicine. This college takes the ground that, as women will en- 
gage in the practice of medicine, “‘ it is far better to assist them to a proper knowledge 
of it than to throw stumbling-blocks in their way, thereby compelling them to rank 
with quacks or to go from New England to find the true knowledge they seek;’” and 
that there can be no more impropriety in instructing them in medicine than in nursing. 
The Boston University School of Medicine (homeopathic) requires an examination for 
admission of all who are not college graduates, presents a 3 years’ graded course of 9 
months each year, which is required for graduation as M. D., and an optional course of 4 
years, leading to the degree of M. D., but conferring B. M. after 3 years’ work. There 
are also special courses and a course for graduates. To the latter physicians are admit- 
ted and allowed to attend such lectures as they choose, receiving certificates for such at- 
tendance. A new chair of instruction has been established, that of the history and 
methodology of the medical sciences. Its work is to define and classify the different sci- 
ences relating to medicine, show their history and relation to each other, the different 
methods of studying and teaching them, and the bibliography of each. The students 
for 1880-81 numbered 110 (66 men and 44 women); graduates, 26 (18 men and 8 women). 
Dentistry was taught in the Boston Dental College and the Dental School of Harvard 
University, both in Boston, and both requiring 3 years of study under a preceptor, with 
2 years of attendance on the lecture courses of these schools, the year of lectures in the 
former, however, covering only 16 weeks, while that in the latter covered 36 weeks. 
The two enrolled 64 students for 1880-’81 and graduated 23.— (Returns. ) 
The Massachusetts College of Pharmacy, Boston, had 101 students during the year and 
sent out15 graduates. An examination is required for admission equal to that demanded 
on entering the high schools of the State. The course covers 2 years of 6 months each, 
and students to graduate must have reached an average of at least 60 per cent. in their 
examination and have had a practical experience of 4 years (including the 2 years’ course) 
in the drug business.— (Catalogue and return.) 
For full statistics of schools of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy reporting, see Table 
XIII of the appendix, and for a summary, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
      SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
SOCIETIES FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HOME STUDY. 
The Society to Encourage Study at home, organized in 1873, had during 1880-’81, its 
eighth year, 960 students, of whom 534 were beginners, and a working staff of 174 cor- 
respondents, the latter being all volunteers. Of 426 students who were not beginners 
205 were in the second year’s work, 109 in the third, 72 in the fourth, 23 in the fifth, 16 
in the sixth, and 1 in the seventh. Among the instructors were 26 former pupils. The 
society was originally intended for the benefit of young girls just out of school; but it 
was soon apparent that help could be given to many other ¢lasses of women, including 
professional teachers. Of these there were 134 belonging to the society during 1880-’81, 
about one-half the number having been students the previous year.—(Eighth annual re- 
port.) 
A similar society for the benefit of young men has been formed, and the first term be- 
gan January 1, 1881. It is designed for all classes and all ages in every section of the 
country. The first annual report shows that 67 persons, 17 to 58 years of age, living in 33 
different States, belonged to the society, and that these included school boys, lawyers, 
mechanics, merchants, commercial travelers, clerks, clergymen, and teachers.—(Congre- 
gationalist and National Journal of Education.)    
  
     
TRAINING IN MUSIC, ORATORY, AND LANGUAGES. 
Advanced instruction in music was given in 1881 in the New England Conservatory of 
Music, Boston, under Professor E. Tourjée, and in the Boston Academy of Music, under 
Carlyle Petersilea, as well as in the musical courses of Boston University and of the Men- 
delssohn Musical Academy and of Wellesley and other colleges for women, already referred 
to, Wellesley having the advantage of one of the most perfect music halls in the country. 
‘Instruction in oratory was offered by Professors R. R. Raymond, F. C. Robertson, L. 
S. Bloch, Anna Baright, and others, of Boston, most, if not all, following the lead of the 
late Professor Lewis B. "Monroe, of the Boston’ Univ exsity School of Oratory. The num- 
ber of students under instruction has not been reported. 
Instruction in languages (French, German, Italian, Latin, modern and ancient Greek) 
was carried forward for 6 weeks in the sixth session of the summer school of languages at 
Amherst College, Amherst, under the direction of Professor L, Sauveur and 6 assistants, 
with 215 students in attendance.

TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR NURSES. 
The Boston City Hospital Training School for Nurses, opened in 1878, has since then had 
159 under instruction and ‘graduated 21. In 1880-781 50 pupils attended and 9 were 
graduated. The course of study extended over two years. 
The Training School of the New England Hospital for Women and Children, Boston, had 
under training 15, the same number as during the previous year. ‘Three others entered, 
but two of these were found to lack strength for the work, and the third was allowed to 
withdraw that le might engage in the study of medicine, for which she was thought 
to have a sp 1 aptitude. Only 6 received diplomas ; one, who completed the course, 
failed to pass such an examination as to entitle her to a diploma, and it was withheld. 
The Boston Training School for Nurses (Massachusetts General Hospital) sends no report 
for 1880~81. 
        TRAINING IN THE ARTS AND TRADES, 
As already noted, a large number of industrial arts and sciences are taught in schools 
connected with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, and the Worcester 
County Free Institute of Industrial Science, Worcester. 
Schools of drawing and painting and of china painting and wood carving are maintained 
by the Boston Musewm of Pine Arts. 
The School of Sculpture and Modelling, Boston, gives gratuitous instruction to pupils too 
poor to pay, terra-cotta work and pottery receiving special attention. 
The Boston Cooking School, opened by the Woman’s Educational Association, has given _ 
instruction in cookery to ladies of wealth, servants, pupils from the City Hospital, Train- 
ing School for Nurses, and a class of deaf mutes. The kitchen garden schools give train- 
ing in household industries to young children, preparing them to be useful heads of fam- 
ilies or skilful domestics, as circumstances may require. 
The Liversidge Institution of Industry, Boston, organized during the autumn of 1881 in 
accordance with a bequest of Thomas Liversidge, late of Dorchester, is intended to afford 
a home and good literary and industrial education to orphans and other destitute boys, 
who must be natives of either New England or Old England. The age for admission is 
7-14; and at 14 the boys may be bound outas apprentices to persons who will train them 
in employments, preference being given to agriculture and to mechanical trades. While 
in the institute they receive some instruction in farm and shop work, as well as a good 
primary and grammar school education.— (Boston Journal. ) 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
For many years it has been the policy of the Commonwealth to provide for the educa- 
tion of this class. They are received at the American Asylum, Hartford (which reported 
61 pupils from Massachusetts in April, 1881), inthe Clarke Institution, Northampton, and 
in the Horace Mann School, Boston, where excellent facilities forinstruction are furnished 
and the State bears a part of the expense. Another institution for this class, the New 
England Industrial School for Deaf-Mutes, Beverly, was incorporated in 1879. Of the 
three first named all except the American Asylum used the articulation method and 
reported very encouraging success init.’ The school at Beverly used the combined method 
of signs and articulation. 
The Clarke Institution, Northampton, had 78 pupils 6 to 19 years of age, the average 
for the year being 77, of whom 61 were from Massachusetts. It is not true, as has been 
said by some, that a majority of the pupils here are semimute or deaf, that they have 
been selected from the more intelligent class of families, or that a majority of the teachers 
have more than ordinary experience. Only 13 out of the whole number attending dur- 
ing the year, or about one-sixth, were semideaf, and none have ever been refused on ac- 
count of the poverty or ignorance of their parents. The course of study comprises the 
common and higher English branches, cabinet making, and sewing.— (State report. ) 
The Horace Mann School for the Deaf, Boston, under the control of the city school board, 
had 91 pupils enrolled in a common school course of study. The chief industry taught 
is sewing, but some of the boys have received instruction out of school hours in the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology; and, as during the previous year, a class of girls at- 
tended the Boston Cooking School on Saturday. Kitchen garden lessons, too, were given 
to a class of 24 girls, the apparatus being brought to the school. 
The New England Industrial School for Deaf-Mutes, Beverly, owns a farm of 57 acres and. 
buildings capable of accommodating 30 persons. It aims to give instruction in all the 
necessary rudiments of knowledge and a thorough mastery of some remunerative occupa- 
tion, including cookery, housework, and sewing.— (Report.) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind, Boston, reports 128 
pupils during 1880-’81; the condition of the school was satisfactory and all the ap-

pliances and apparatus were of the most approved kind. The course of instruction com- 
prises the English branches of a common and high school grade, with such employments 
as mattress and broom making, cane seating, sewing, knitting, and domestic work. The 
work of the printing department was carried on during the year with unusual vigor, ten 
new books for the blind being issued. In response to an appeal by the trustees, about 
$44,000 were raised towards a printing fund for the blind, and it was hoped that the 
amount would be increased toa sum which will yield an income of $5,000 a year. The 
Kindergarten system has been found an efficient help in training the sense of touch and 
the powers of observation, comparison, combination, invention, memory, reflection, and 
action. There has been a steady advancement in the music department, where all the 
branches, including tuning, are taught; and to the tuning department has been in- 
trusted for the fifth time the care of the 130 pianos in the Boston public schools: 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth, South Boston, the Private 
Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, Barre, and the Hillsdale School, Fayville, gave mental, 
moral, and ‘physical training to over 200 feeble-minded children. The Hillsdale school 
received also the deaf ‘and dumb and blind or a any who could not be taught in ordinary 
schools, the number being limited to 12. The State school at South Boston gave its care 
gratuitously to pupils whose parents were not able to pay; to others a charge was made 
proportionate to the means of parents and the trouble and cost of treatment. Number 
of children in the school during the year, 130 (79 boys and 51 girls); of teachers, 5; 
of other employés, 23. The institution at Barre had 74 pupils (46 boys | and 28 girls), 
under 9 teachers.— (Reports and returns. ) 
For full statistics of institutions of this class reporting, see Table XIX of the ap- 
pendix, and for asummary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
  REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
Eleven institutions intended either for the reformation of neglected youth or for 
training in industrial pursuits reported a total membership for 1880-81 of more than 
1,600, Four only.of these schools are sustained by private charity, the remainder being 
under State, county, or city control. 
Two of -the 11 institutions referred to are truant schools, viz, that in Worcester City, 
and the Hampden County school, at Springfield; the others are Marcella Street Home, 
Boston; the Industrial School, Lawrence, under municipal control; Plummer Farm School, 
Salem; Industrial School for Girls, Dorchester; North End Industrial Home and North 
End Mission, Boston; the last 4 are maintained by private and church effort. 
The State Primary School, Monson, included in the above, is wholly sustained by State 
appropriation. Children are received from the almshouse and from the superintend- 
ent of the indoor poor, and are retained until homes can be found for them. They are 
taught the English branches, tailoring, baking, shoe mending, farm and house work, and 
sewing. Although the average age of the children is something less than 10 years, all 
articles of clothing for inmates, as well asthe beddingand household goods, are made by 
the children and employés, except the shoes, which are only mended. The total number 
of pupils was 403; the average, 399. Within the year 249 were sent to homes found for 
them or to friends. 
The State Reform School, Westborough, reports a trying year in some respects, owing 
to the misbehavior of a few boys, encouraged and aggravated by hostile influences from 
without. Although the school has accomplished much good during 32 years of exist- 
ence, the trustees think this has not been commensurate with the labor and money spent 
on it. They think the principal difficulty has been in putting the age for admission 
too high, the maximum being 17 years, when it should not be more than 14. The 
school was designed for boys of tender years who were hopeful subjects of reform; but it 
has been made a place of imprisonment for some who are unfit companions for them. 
Another difficulty is the congregate system which in part prevails. All the troubles and 
disturbances, and nearly all the escapes, have been from the main building, where 
brick cells and other means for forcible restraint were regarded by the boys as so many 
challenges to.their daring and ingenuity, while those living in family houses and under 
family discipline were generally commendable in behavior and did not abuse the liberty 
granted them. There were 179 inmates during the year 1880-’81. The 4schools main- 
tained were of two grades and embraced the elementary English branches. The indus- 
tries taught were farm and domestic work and cane seating of chairs. 
In the State Reform School for Girls, Lancaster, the number of girls at date of the re- 
port was smaller than ever before in the history of the school. Out of 125 present dur- 
ing the year, 60. were placed in homes and only 6 returned, the largest number, consid- 
ering the size of the school, ever placed out and the smallest percentage of returns. The 
reports from employers may generally be summed up by the words “doing well.” Itis

not claimed that they are thoroughly reformed, but that they are doing better than be- 
fore committal, and many of them striving to become good and useful women. The 
common English branches, housework, dress making, and sewing are taught. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Massachusetts Teachers’ Association held its annual meeting for 1881 at Boston, 
December 29-31. The-programme was well arranged, with able speakers on live topics, 
and the discussions are said to have been bright and interesting, although necessarily 
brief. 
The first paper before the general association was by G. Stanley Hall, on ‘‘ The moral 
and religious training of children.’”? The next, by Mr. Luther W. Anderson, of Boston, 
on ‘‘ Teaching history,’’ led to considerable discussion. One on ‘‘ School supervision,” 
by Mr. N. A. Calkins, was discussed by, Superintendent Seaver, of Boston, Secretary 
Dickinson, of the Massachusetts State board, and by General Oliver. The last gentle- 
man presented what he called the other side of the supervision question, deprecating the 
influence of politics in it and urging the importance of securing competent supervisors. 
Governor Long, in # short address, expressed a willingness to codperate with the legisla- 
ture in any measure for the furtherance of education, referring to the need for additional 
agents and increased supervision. Mr. John D. Philbrick, in a paper on ‘‘ The tenure 
of office of teachers,’’ insisted that a permanent tenure is the true means of securing 
a competent body of teachers, and cited French and American authorities against the 
system which prevails in the United States, but, he asserted, in no other civilized coun- 
try. Brief remarks on the subject were added by Rey. Dr. Miner and others, and it was 
decided to appoint a committee to bring the subject before the legislature. Dr. Will- 
iam T. Harris, of Concord, Massachusetts, then spoke on ‘‘The nature and necessity of 
pedagogical reform;’’ Mr. SoG Boyden, of, Bridgewater, on ‘‘Teaching form; ’? and Mr. 
E. A. Hubbard, of Massachusetts, on‘‘ Why do pupils learn so much and know so little?” 
The answer of ‘the speaker was that they study for the sake of reciting rather than for 
knowledge, and often learn the words of a lesson without mastering its 4 thoughts. 
Before the primary school section a paper was read by Dr. B. Joy Jefiries, of Boston, 
on ‘Teaching color in school;’’ also one by Mr. Daniel B. Hagar, of the Salem Normal 
School, on ‘‘The phonetic method of teaching reading.’’ The latter drew forth Messrs. 
Parker, Leigh, Clarke, Philbrick, Eaton, and others, all except Colonel Parker favoring 
the phonetic method. 
Before the grammar school section, Mr. Charles F. King, of Boston, read a paper on 
“ Geography taught by topics,’ and Mr. Putnam, master of Franklin Grammar School, 
Boston, one on “The relation of the teacher and his methods to the moral culture of his 
pupils. Mz, Putnam disapproved of the self reporting system as tending to foster dis- 
honesty. The discussion which followed showed a difference of opinion on this point. 
The high school section listened to an address on ‘‘The poets in school”? from Mr. 
William J. Rolfe, who thought too little use is made of poetry in the public schools, and 
one on the method of studying modern languages, by Mr. Hermann B. Boisen, of Boston, 
who insisted on the advantages of the conversational over book methods of teaching. a 
(National Journal of Education. ) 
ASSOCIATION OF CLASSICAL AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
The Massachusetts Association of Classical and High School Teachers held its four- 
teenth annual meeting at Boston, April 9 and 10, 1881. 
After the usual preliminary business, Mr. Forbes, of the Roxbury Latin School, pre- 
sented a very ingenious method for practically illustrating the law of ‘‘ The parallelo- 
gram of forces’” by the use of a simple arrangement of weights and pulleys attached to 
a frame on the blackboard, on which the diagrams should be first drawn. Mr. Elbridge 
Smith, Dorchester, added a few remarks on the use of an umbrella for the same purpose. 
Mr. John Tetlow, ‘of the Girls’ Latin School, followed with a plea for “‘ Quantitative 
pronunciation in Latin, ” and Mr. 8. Thurber urged admission to college on the recom- 
mendation of the teacher, without examination, taking the ground that by this means 
cramming is prevented and a more profitable use of the pupil’s time insured, while the 
teacher’s certificate is a much better indication of the fitness of the applicant ‘than is the 
result of a college admission examination. A somewhat animated discussion followed, 
in which Professor Lincoln, of Brown University, Mr. W. C. Collar, Mr. Tetlow, Pro- 
fessor Hitchcock, of Amherst College, and Principal Ladd, of Chauncey Hall School, 
Boston, participated. Professor G. M. Lane, of Harvard College, read a paper on “‘ Latin 
conjugation.”” A discussion on ‘‘ Requirements for admission to college in English,’’ 
with special reference to Harvard, was opened with a paper by Mr. W. C. Collar, of the 
Roxbury Latin School, Professor Shipman of Tufts College, Professor W. P. Atkinson of

the Institute of Technology, and others participating. On the second day, after the elec: 
tion of officers for the ensuing year and the reports of committees, six short papers were 
given on ‘‘Sight translation,’? on an elucidation of two lines from the Iliad, on a 
phrase in Virgil, on the manipulation of glass, on Seeley’s History and Politics, and on the 
uselessness of graduating exercises, Elbridge Smith, of Dorchester, closing with a report 
on the importance of a history of education in Massachusetts. — (Journal of Education. )

GEORGE B. EMERSON. 
While Maine was still a part of Massachusetts, Mr. Emerson there first saw the light, 
September 12, 1797. His father, a physician of “taste and culture, early taught his hoy 
the languages and literature necessary to prepare him for college, aiding him also in 
his study of the botany and natural history of the neighborhood. He was thus at 16 
ready to enter Harvard College, in the class with George Bancroft, Caleb Cushing, and 
others of almost equal note; he held his own with them to the time of graduation, 
when, teaching for a while to recruit his finances, he was recalled to Harvard as tutor in 
mathematics. Preparing for use in the college an important French text book on the 
calculus, he so commended himself to the authorities as to be offeaed the mathematical 
professorship while still only about 24. But being offered also the headship of the Eng- 
lish Classical School of Boston, he preferred this to the professorship, because of the better 
opportunity it gave for testing certain theories he had as to methods of discipline and 
teaching. These aimed at very slight use of punishments, at a fair recognition of all 
honest progress, and at efforts to stimulate each pupil to endeavor to excel himself rather 
than excel his fellows. Hissuccess was so complete that within two years he was offered 
by some of the best men of Boston a salary of $3,000 a year to give girls, in a special 
school for them, the advantage of his methods. He accepted it on condition that the 
school be limited to 32, and. thenceforth always had it filled to this utmost limit, with 
pending applications for any vacancy that might occur. Of course a man thus demon- 
strating his ability gained influence, and he used this wisely in favor of better methods 
in the State school system, which he did much to improve and perfect. He died March 
4, 1881, full of years and honors, an author of fair repute, a member of several learned 
societies, a doctor of laws of Harvard from 1859, and with the title of “‘The model teacher 
of the nineteenth century.’’ 
HENRY FOWLE DURANT. 
This gentleman, known for many years as a successful lawyer at the Boston bar, will 
be better known in coming time as the generous founder of the first true college for women 
an the State of Massachusetts and one of the two or three very best in the United States. 
His original name was Henry Welles Smith, but when he came into active life he found 
embarrassment in business from the fact that there were several other Smiths with almost 
precisely the same name, and therefore had his changed by act of legislature to one em- 
bodying his mother's two family names. Born 1822, he entered Harvard at 15 with Ed- 
ward Hammond Clarke, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and others since well known, 
graduating with them in due course in 1841. Having studied law in connection with 
his collegiate studies, he was admitted to the bar in the same year in which he graduated, 
and was at once taken into partnership with his father and Benjamin F. Butler, in their 
law office at Lowell. Here he laid the foundation of that reputation for keen acumen 
and intense devotion to the cases given him which subsequently brought him fame and 
wealth. But Lowell was not wide enough for his ambition, and in 1846 he went to Bos- 
ton, continually increasing his practice till he was about 40 years of age, when the death 
of his only son, a boy of high promise and ardently beloved, so saddened him that he 
threw up his profession and never tried a case again. Looking around for something to 
which he might devote the wealth he had amassed and had intended for his child, the 
thought of women’s need of higher and wider opportunities for thorough education sug- 
gested the idea of founding for them such a college as might be eventually a Harvard for 
the sex. The thought grew into a purpose, the purpose was carried out with the decision 
that marked all his acts, and Wellesley College, with beautiful buildings, e and 
charming grounds, full courses, numerous and eager students, will remain a spiendid 
monument of Mr. Durant’s intelligent and judicious liberality.

£122 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the State, these are a superintendent of public instruction, with a 2 years’ term; 
aboard of education of 3 members, which has control of the State Normal School and ex- 
amination of teachers for State certificates; and a board of 8 regents of the University of 
Michigan, elected by the people for terms of 8 years, 2 to be changed annually. The 
local officers are district boards of 3 each for terms of 3 years, with annual change of 1; 
township boards of school inspectors, with 3 members; a board of 6 trustees, with one- 
third annually changed, in districts having over 100 children of school age; and 3 county 
school examiners elected by the chairmen of township boards in each county at their an- 
nual meeting, 1 to be changed each year. Women of 21 are eligible to the office of school 
inspector, and with the usual qualifications of electors are entitled to vote in district 
meetings.— (School laws of 1881.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The school system extends from the lowest ungraded schools up to the State Univer- 
sity, including a State Agricultural College, State Normal School, Institution for the 
Deaf and Dumb, School for the Blind, State Reform School (for boys), Reform School for 
Girls, and a Public School for Dependent Children, all supported by special appropriations 
from the State. The ordinary public schools are sustained from the income of a perma- 
nent school fund; a township tax of 1 mill on $1; a district tax voted by the district for 
buying or building school-houses, the amount to be proportioned to the number of chil- 
dren of school age in the di trict. Where bonded indebtedness is incurred districts con- 
taining less than 10 children are not to raise more than $250; districts containing be- 
tween 10 and 30, $500; and ricts containing between 30 and 50, $1,000; and such ad- 
ditional tax as shall be necessary to keep the school-houses in good repair, furnish appa- 
ratus, support libraries, pay liabilities and district officers, the amount not to exceed 
one-half that raised for building. To obtain State aid, schools must not be sectarian, 
must have been taught the time required by law’ and by a legally qualified teacher. 
Teachers must hold one of the 3 grades of certificates of qualification given by the county 
boards of examiners,” subject to the approval of the State superintendent, or from the 
State board of education, authorizing them to teach throughout the State without fur- 
ther examination for 10 years. No school or department shall be tanght separately on 
account of race or color. Township and district libraries, county teachers’ institutes, 
and a State teachers’ association are provided for.— (School law of 1881.) 
     
  GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics for the year show a large and general advance. With 12,073 more youth 
of school age, 9,187 more were enrolled in the public schools, making 71.7 per cent. of 
the school population enrolled, an increase of one-tenth of 1 per cent., while in private 
and church schools there were 934 more than in the previous year, bringing up still higher 
the percentage of those under instruction. Of the public school pupils it may be noted, 
too, that while the ungraded schools had 1,703 fewer in attendance the graded ones had 
10,890 more. For the additional pupils there was fair provision, as respects accommo- 
dation, in 8,595 more sittings, the districts with graded schools increasing in consider- 
ably larger proportion than the whole number maintaining schools. For imparting in- 
struction there were 523 more teachers, 66 more having had some good normal training 
under the conductors of State institutes. The average enrolment at each one of these 
institutes was for the year 14 more than in the year preceding, showing a slight increase 
of disposition to improve, though not yet as much as could be wished for. More- 
over, for the reading of both the teachers and the pupils, there were 17,891 more vol- 
umes in school libraries, with additional apparatus for the illustration of instruction, 
estimated by the superintendent to be worth about $200,000. The permanent available 
State school fund increased $159,241; the current receipts for public schools, $770,289; 
the expenditure for them going up $307,683. And all this increase, it is worth noting, 
came in a year when forest fires desolated large portions of three great counties, laying 
waste the farms, villages, and homes of the inhabitants and calling for large contributions 
from the people of the State. 
While all the above things show a relative improvement that is very gratifying, there 
are some things stated positively and without comparison with the preceding year that 
show an excellent condition of affairs in matters of importance which, if compared with 
‘1880, would also show considerable gains. For example: of the 6, 526 school districts, 
1Not less than 9 months of the year in districts having §00 children of school age, not less taan 5 where there are from 30 to 800, and not less than 3 in all other districts. 2Changed by law of 1881 from township inspectors.

3,262 had uniform lists of text books; 852 had a prescribed course of study; 3,067 had 
dictionaries; 1,166 made no change of teachers during the year; 1,080 of the teachers had 
their certificates renewed without a reéxamination; 302 held State Normal School diplo- 
mas, and 4,061 counted on making teaching a profession. 
REPEAL OF THE COMPULSORY SCHOOL LAW. 
Owing to the neglect of the compulsory school law, passed 10 years ago, the legislature 
in 1881 repealed it. Itrequired children 8 to 14 year: ge to be sent to public schools 
at least twelve weeksin eachschool year, unless excused for cause or educated elsewhere. 
(Letter from assistant State superintendent of public instruction. ) 
  KINDERGARTEN. 
In 1880-81 four of these schools reported from Detroit, viz: the Kindergarten of the 
German-American Seminary, with 45 pupils; Mrs. Hailmann’s Kindergarten, with 16; 
one organized in 1880, conducted by Maria C. Elder, with 12; and Miss Jennings’s Kin- 
dergarten, organized in 1880, with 12, showing a total of 85 pupils. All these Kinder- 
girten had the usual employments and appliances. 
In Ionia City the Second Ward Kindergarten, organized in 1880, reported 1 conductor; 
it was connected with the public school, had 40 pupils, and provided the usual employ- 
ments. Oneat Grand Rapids gave no data except that it was in connection with a primary 
school.-— (Returns. ) 
For further information in regard to these schools reporting, see Table V of the ap- 
pendix. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
In certain cities, under a general law for graded schools, there are boards of 6 trustees 
elected by the people for terms of 3 years, with annual change of 2; while some others 
are controlled by special laws. In Detroit, by an act of March, 1881, a school board of 
12 is elected instead of 26 as formerly, 6 to serve for 2 years and 6 for 4, and to be elected 
from the city at large instead of 2 from each ward as before.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
In Adrian 30 per cent. of the population were of school age; 60 per cent. of these were 
enrolled in public schools, while 68.25 per cent. of those enrolled were in average daily 
attendance. Thirty-one teachers were employed, and expenditures for school purposes 
reached $28,503. Special instruction was given in drawing and penmanship. The high 
school enrolled 199, with average daily attendance of 149; the grammar schools 503, aver- 
age daily attendance 363; and the primary schools 722, average daily attendance 460. 
School property was valued at $104,000.— (State report.) 
Ann Arbor in 1880-’81 had 885 of her 1,900 public school pupils in primary grades, 545 
in the grammar, and 470 in the high, under 37 teachers, all women except 5 in the high 
school. There were 6 school buildings, with 1,480 sittings, besides 7 rooms used only 
for recitations, all valued, with other school property, at $140,500. There was an ad- 
vance of 23 in enrolment over previous year, 20 of these being in the high school. The 
average daily attendance reached 75 per cent. of the enrolment and 95 per cent. of the 
average number belonging. The work of the year is said to have been carried forward
-P-A-G-E-402

  with unusual steadiness and smoothness. Most of the teachers made creditable advance 
in skill and methods of teaching. The course of study below the high school, covering 
8 years, was carefully arranged with reference to its practical usefulness. More time 
than formerly was given to language work, while arithmetic, as heretofore, was studied 
from the first class entered up to that seeking admission to the high school. From lack 
of a regular teacher music received less attention than was desirable. There was an esti- 
mated enrolment of 200 in private and parochial schools.— (Report and return. ) 
In Bay City 29 per cent. of the population were of school age, and 50 per cent. of these 
were enrolled in the public schools, the average daily attendance being 60 per cent. on 
enrolment and 92 per cent. on average number belonging. In the primary grades the 
enrolment was 2,148, with average daily attendance of 1,277; in the grammar 670, with 
average daily attendance of 405; while in the high school it was 173 and average daily 
attendance 121. There were 48 teachers, all women but 2, and 7 school buildings, hav- 
ing 2,600 sittings, and 8 rooms used only for recitations, all valued, with other school 
property, at $146,000. Instruction was given in drawing, and 250 pupils studied Ger- 
man. In private and parochial schools 500 were enrolled.— (Return. ) 
Detroit returned 43 per cent. of its school population in public schools and 71 per cent. 
of these in average daily attendance. The city public schools were classed as primary, 
grammar, and high, with a course covering 12 years, giving 4 to each division. The 
high school also had graduate and special students. The schools were under 263 teach- 
ers, 4 being special. There were 28 public school buildings, with 13,110 sittings, and, 
excluding 2 small rented buildings, they were valued, with sites, &c., at $821,489. 
Special instruction was given in music, drawing, penmanship, and reading. Schools 
were taught 196 of the 200 school days. A night school for boys was held 81 nights in 
the high school building, with a total enrolment of 469 and an average attendance of 
116, employing an average of 5 men teachers, at a cost of $732.75. The usefulness of 
such schools was said to be no longer a question, although irregularity of attendance 
was a great difficulty. In the “ training class for teachers’? the first year’s work was re- 
ported to have been eminently successful. There were 6,731 enrolled in private and 
parochial schools.— (City report and return. ) 
East Saginaw had 8 brick and 3 frame school buildings, with 3,075 sittings for 
study and 7 rooms used only for recitation, all valued, with other school property, at 
$200,000. The schools were graded as primary, grammar, and high, with a course cov- 
ering 12 years, giving 4 to each class of schools. In the primary there were 2,067 en- 
rolled and 1,452 in average daily attendance; in the grammar 938, and 708 in daily at- 
tendance; in the high 184, with 148 in daily attendance. In all, 49.6 per cent. of school 
population were in the public schools, under 62 teachers. The schools were in session 
194 of the 200 days of the school year. A night school for youths over 15 was taught 3 
nights a week for three and a half months, with an enrolment of 125 boys and an aver- 
age attendance of 60. The result was satisfactory. Special instruction was given in 
music, drawing, and penmanship. Irregularity of attendance continued, with some 
improvement, however, but the fact that the compulsory law remained a dead letter 
was regretted. The decrease in tardiness was encouraging. More school room was 
needed. The estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools was 400.— (City 
report and return. ) 
Flint reported. 91 per cent. of its school population enrolled in the public schools, but 
only 59 per cent. of the enrolment was in average daily attendance. The schools were 
graded as primary, grammar, and high, the primary having 15 teachers, the grammar 17, 
the high 5. For these schools there were 7 buildings, with 1,770 sittings for study and 5 
rooms for recitation; all, with sites, &c., valued at $144,000. Special teachers in music 
and penmanship were employed. Schools were in session 195} days. There were 95 en- 
rolled in private and parochial schools.— (Return. ) 
Grand Rapids showed an increase of 851 in children of school age over the previous 
year, mainly due to the coming in of foreign laborers; but only 55 per cent. of the whole 
number were gathered into the public schools, and only 62 per cent. of those enrolled 
were retained in average daily attendance. The schools were graded as primary, gram- 
mar, and high, with a course of 12 years, giving 4 to each division. Of the 105 teachers, 
including those in evening schools, all but 16 were women. There were 16 school build- 
ings, and with one or two exceptions they were substantial structures, supplying 4,834 
sittings, 12 rooms for recitation, and 87 for study and recitation, each under one teacher; 
all valued, with sites, &c., at $386,000. Music, drawing, and penmanship were taught 
by 2 special teachers. Of 11,952 volumesin the public school library 1,590 were added 
during the year. For night schools, 7 rooms were used and 7 teachers employed, with an 
enrolment of 280 and an average attendance of 70. The continuance of these schools 
was recommended. There was an estimated enrolment of 1,000 in private and parochial 
schools.— (City report and return. ) 
Jackson, which includes 2 districts in the city, reported an enrolment of 81 per cent.

ance, under 56 teachers. School property was valued at $160,000.— (State report. ) 
Kalamazoo, as compared with 1879-80, showed a gain of 211 in children of school age, 
but a loss of 85 in enrolment and of 133 in average daily attendance. It had only 64 
per cent. of its school population enrolled, and the same per cent. of those enrolled in av- 
erage ee attendance, with 45 teachers and school property valued at $119,700.— (State 
report. 
Tanai reported small gains in school population and attendance. It showed 68 per 
cent. of children of school age enrolled, 67 per cent. of those enrolled in average belong- 
ing, with 92 per cent. of these in average daily attendance, under 31 teachers; and esti- 
mated value of school property $106,000.— (State report. ) 
Muskegon reported its public schools classed in the usual twelve years’ course. The high 
school had two parallel courses, a Latin-scientific and an English-scientific, each of four 
years. The enrolment for the year in all the schools was 50 per cent. of the school pop- 
ulation, while only 64 per cent. of those enrolled were in average daily attendance. 
The prevalence of diphtheria during the fall and winter reduced attendance. School 
property was valued at $91,92: (State and city reports.) 
Port Huron had 5 school buildings, with 26 rooms for its primary, grammar, and high 
schools, valued, not including sites, &c., at $80,000. The schools enrolled 61 per cent. 
of school population under 26 teachers and were taught 197 days. There were 300 en- 
rolled in private and parochial schools.— (Return. 
Saginaw had 50 per cent. of the children of school age enrolled in its public schools and 
held 71 per cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance under 34 teachers. For 
its schools, graded as high, grammar, and ‘primary, there were 6 school buildings, with 
1,656 sittings and 4 rooms used only for recitation, all valued, with other property, at 
$100,000. Special instruction was given in music, drawing, and penmanship. Schools were 
theta ae days. There was an enrolment of 600 in private and parochial schools.—

      TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE PROVISION FOR NORMAL INSTRUCTION. 
The Michigan State Normal School, Ypsilanti, in 1880-81 placed itself in close rela- 
tion with other schools of the State by a system of interchange of reports and accept- 
ance of certificates of standing from those schools asa basis of admission to advanced 
standing. Greatly needed room in the ‘‘practice school’? was provided for through 
a State appropriation of $25,000, and a new building for that department was to be 
in readiness in September, 1882, when the State board hoped to reorganize the school 
and introduce a new plan of work. During the year the State board authorized changes 
in the courses of instruction so as to present five distinctly different courses, viz, scien- 
tific, language, literary, art, and common school, each covering 4 years, except the com- 
mon school, which covers 2 years. By substituting a language in place of certain studies 
in the scientific, literary, or art course, students are said to have seventeen courses from 
which they may make a selection. In regard to the ‘‘ professional course,’’ the board 
ordered that students sustaining examinations or presenting certificates of standing in 
all the academic subjects in any course may complete the professional work of that course 
in 1 year; and, in regard to ‘professional training,’’ that during the first year of the 
common school course, and the first and second years of the others, each pupil is re- 
quired to note the methods of instruction pursued by the teacher and give an accurate 
account of the same. 
There was a total enrolment of 492, of whom 174 were in the ‘‘ practice school”? and 
318 were normal pupils under 12 instructors. Outof 90 students graduated, 80 were in the 
next school year engaged in teaching. Diplomas from the common school course entitle 
the holder to a certificate to teach 3 years in the public schools of the State without 
examination. Graduation from any of the higher courses entitles those holding diplomas 
to life ooo to teach in any public school in the State.— (State report, return, and 
cireular. 
The course in the science and art of teaching in the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 
in 1880-’81 covered 1 year, divided into 2 subcourses which were substantially the same 
asin the previous year, except that in the first semester there were 4 lectures instead 
of 2, and a corresponding extension of the work. The general purpose in both was 
not so much to teach specific methods as to put students in firm possession of a body of 
doctrines, assuming that they can form for themselves their own art out of the principles 
they learn. In connection with each course a certain amount of reading was required, 
the general library affording a choice selection of 200 pedagogical works. Teachers’ 
diplomas designed to be certificates of qualification were given to those who, pursuing 
one of the courses and some one other course of study with reference to teaching, by

  special examination showed the required qualifications. Recitations and lectures were 
given 4 times a week through the yearof 36 weeks. There was an enrolment of 71 nor- 
mal students, with 1 instructor.— (Announcement, 1880-’81, and return.) 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Mr. and Mrs. Hailmann still report from Detroit, where they opened in October, 1881, 
anew training class of ladies wishing to become Kindergartners, the course to last 8 months, 
with daily instruction and lectures.— (Kindergarten Messenger, August, 1881.) 
Normal courses were reported in cotleges, at Adrian, of 2 years; at Albion, of 4 years, 
with a shorter course of 3 years; at Battle Creek, a 4 years’ regular course and 8 weeks’ 
drill for teachers during the first 8 weeks of each college year; at Grand Traverse College, 
anormal course of undefined length; at Hillsdale, a 2 years’ course, with diplomas of 
graduation instead of degrees; and at Olivet, anormal department of 3 courses, an element- 
ary of 2 years, a full English of 3, and a language course of 4. A summer normal class 
of 5 weeks was held here in July and August.— (Catalogues. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The State Teachers’ Institute was held at Lansing July 5-8. . The prime object of this 
meeting is to prepare for the institute work of the ensuing year by discussing the various 
methods of teaching the different topics which should be presented at the county insti- 
tutes. There were 98 in attendance, among whom were 19 of the prominent instructors 
of the State. The work of preparing a manual for the institute work of the next two 
years was taken up, and each syllabus of the preceding one was frankly and fully cviti- 
cised. These gentlemen brought to this work a large experience derived from active 
work in institutes, resulting in a manual said to be well adapted to its purpose. In addi- 
tion to the labors of each day, an evening conference was held, where an interchange of 
views was had upon the minor details of institute management. Besides this, 54 insti- 
tutes were held during the year in as many counties, with an aggregate enrolment of 
4,450, making, with the State institute, 4,548, a gain of 66 over the previous year, although 
the number of institutes wasless by 10. ‘The average enrolment showed an increase of over 
20 per cent. These institutes bring annually to the counties where they are held a well 
trained corps of educators, giving to the teachers the best methods and bringing some 
measure of professional training within the reach of all. They have thus become an im- 
portant factor in the improvement of teachers.— (State report.) 
  EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Michigan School Moderator, the present educational paper of the State, was be- 
gun in the year 1880, and reached the close of the first volume September, 1881. It is 
published weekly at Grand Rapids, giving much information in regard to the school work 
in the State, and also that of the different States, with other matter bearing on methods 
of teaching and improvements in school work. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In 411 gradedypublic school districts 60 high schools were reported, with a total enrol- 
ment of 6,563, an average belonging of 4,767, and an average daily attendance of 4,373. 
Ann Arbor, with an enrolment of 470, offered 5 courses, classical, Latin, scientific, 
English, and commercial, each of the first 4 covering 4 years and the last covering 2. 
Detroit enrolled 773 in regular English, classical, Latin, and preparatory English courses 
of 4 years each. Last Saginaw, with’an enrolment of 184, offered classical, Latin, scien- 
tific, English, and English-German courses of 4 years each. Grand Rapids enrolled 410 
in common English, preparatory English, classical, Latin-scientific, scientific and en- 
gineering, French, and German courses of 4 years each. Muskegon, with an enrolment 
of 84, had Latin-scientific and English-scientific courses of 4 years each.— (State and 
city reports. ) 
High schools within the State that have in any year been examined and approved by a 
committee from the faculty of the University of Michigan may in that year send their 
graduates into the freshman class of the university on their diplomas. At the begin- 
ning of the university year 1880-81, such students were received from the high schools 
of Ann Arbor, Battle Creek, Coldwater, Corunna, Detroit, East Saginaw, Fenton, Flint, 
Grand Rapids, Jackson, Monroe, Pontiac, Saginaw, and Ypsilanti. At the opening of 
1881~82 they came from the schools of the same places, with the addition of Manistee, 
Milford, and Union City; also, from the Michigan Military Academy, Orchard Lake, 
which, within the year, had been accorded the same privilege as the high schools in this 
respect.— (Calendars of university for these years. )

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES YOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (non-sectarian), organized in 1841, is a part of 
the public educational system of the State. Its general control is vested in a board of 8 
regents, elected by the people for terms of 8 years. From its small beginning, 40 years 
ago, with 53 students, its calendar for 1880-’81 shows an enrolment of Fy 534. In accord- 
ance with the law of ‘the State, the university has aimed to complete and crown the work 
begun in the public schools by supplying facilities for a liberal education, offering these 
privileges free of tuition to all of either sex in or out of the State who are qualified for 
admission. Its relation to the public schools of the State since 1871, when students from 
the approved high schools were first admitted on diplomas, has been closer than ever be- 
fore. It comprises departments of literature, science, and the arts (which last now in- 
cludes a school of political science as well as a department of the science and art of teach- 
ing), with schools of medicine and surgery (regular and homeeopathic), law, pharmacy, 
and dental surgery. The school of political science was introduced during the year, 
following Cornell University, which was the first to have a school of history and political 
science, and keeping pace with Columbia College, which introduced such a course in 
1830-81. In the departments of literature, science, and arts different lines of study lead 
to the degrees of B. A., B. S., B. L., PH. B., C. E., and M. E.. In this department there 
were 521 students; in that of medicine and surgery, 380; in the school of law, 371; in that 
of pharmacy, 88; in that of dental surgery, 86; and in the homeopathic medical college, 
88; total number of students in the university, 1,534. 
The other colleges rting (all admitting women) are Adxian (Methodist Protestant), 
Albion (Methodist Episcopal), Battle Creek (Seventh Day Adventist), Hillsdale (Free 
Will Baptist), Kalamazoo (Baptist), Olivet (Congregational Presbyterian), all having 
post offices corresponding to their titles; while Grand Traverse College, Benzonia (Con- 
gregational), and Hope*College, at Holland (Reformed Dutch), still remained on the list. 
All showed preparatory courses of 1 to 4 years and classical of 4; all but Hope College, 
scientific courses of 3 to 4 years; all but Hope and Kalamazoo, normal of 2 to 4 years. 
Battle Creek, Grand Traversg, and Hillsdale showed commercial courses, the last adding 
instruction in telegraphy. Battle Creek had a minim department for children under 14 
years of age, also intended to serve as a model school, where a limited number of those 
preparing to teach are trained after the most approved methods. Excepting Kalamazoo 
and Grand Traverse, all had French and German in their courses, while Albion added 
Anglo-Saxon; Battle Creek, Danish; and Hope, Dutch. Schools of art and music ap- 
peared in the courses of Adrian, Albion, Olivet, and Hillsdale,! the latter adding acourse 
of 4 years in philosophy. Albion showed separate Greek, Latin, Latin-scientific, Eng- 
lish, and scientific courses of 4 years e: ding during the year a school of painting + 
in connection with a literary course of 4 years, and introducing scientific vocal music as 
aspecialty. Grand Traverse remained much as reported in 1878~’79, its burned build- 
ings not having been fully replaced, and some difficulties in relation to fundsstill exist- 
ing. In1880-’81 its most important work was the education of teachers for schools in the 
vicinity. Hopewasexpressed that in the near future this school may accomplish its reg- 
ular college work.

Commissioner preceding.   
    
  
  INSTITUTION FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG W' OMEN. 
As the university and colleges of this State admit women freely to their privileges, 
there has been no call for colleges especially for them. The only institution approxi- 
mating this rank, and meant for young women only, has been for some years the Michi- 
gan Female Seminary, Kalamazoo, which the State visitors have in successive reports 
- commended as giving a high order of instruction in udies under healthy home in- 
fluences, with some training i in Goes occupations.— (State reports. ) 
     
1 An officer of Hillsdale College writes that from 1877 it has had # fullschool year of general geom- etry and calculus, practically elective, with a year of Greek and Latin. During this time the same number of ladies as gentlemen (10 of each) have elected this study in higher mathematics, A more interesting fact is that the ladies have shown as much interest as the gentlemen in this mathemati- eal study, and equal ability in the work regularly assignec.

128 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The Michigan Agricultural College, Lansing, reported substantially the same regular 
course of 4 years, with elective and graduate courses, as in 1879-’80. The instruction is 
mainly practical in its character. Labor with fair compensation is furnished to the stu- 
dent. Under the auspices of the State board of agriculture, 6 farmers’ institutes were 
held during the winter in different parts of the State, conducted in part by the faculty 
of the college. 
There were 228 students in attendance during the year, and 33 graduated with the de- 
gree of B. S., bringing the total number of graduates up to 244. The relations of the col- 
lege and the agricultural societies of the State were reported to be mutually friendly. 
Scientific courses were reported in each of the 8 colleges of the State and in the uni- 
versity, that of the last comprising civil, mechanical, and mining engineering, with special 
and advanced coursesin paleontology, zodlogy, botany, physics, astronomy, and chemistry. 
For statistics of scientific schools, courses, and departments, see Tables IX and X of 
the appendix, and the summaries of them in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSION AL. 
Theological.— The following colleges showed theological courses: Adrian (Methodist 
Protestant), Battle Creek (Seventh Day Adventist), and Hillsdale (Free Will Baptist). 
In Adrian the school of theology was not fully defined. A 3 years’ course, leading to the 
degree of B. D., was laid down, and instruction given so far as demanded apparently to 
students in the collegiate courses. 
The department of theology in Battle Creek is designed for young men and women pre- 
paring for the ministry or missionary work, whose circumstances do not allow a complete 
collegiate course. A biblical course of 3 years was the only one yet arranged. 
The theological department in Hillsdale reported an English course, embracing all the 
studies of the regular course except the ancient languages. 
Those desiring admission to these schools must show a fair acquaintance with English 
studies. 
Legal.— The law department of Michigan University furnished legal education in a 
course of 2 years of 6 months each, leading to the degree of LL.B. Each candidate was 
required to prepare a dissertation upon some legal topic, which must be satisfactory in 
matter, form, and style. There were in attendance during the year 371 students.— 
(Calendar. ) 
Medical.—'The 2 medical schools of the Michigan University, that of medicine and sur- 
gery (regular) and the homeopathic, have since 1880 given instruction in required graded 
courses of 3 years of 9 months each, and in 2 extended optional courses, one of physiological 
and pathological chemistry, the other in toxicology. In both, women were admitted on 
the same conditions as men, instruction for the most part being given separately. Re- 
quirements for the degree of M. D. were substantially the same in both, viz, 3 years’ study 
of medicine, including time at lectures, and a satisfactory examination in all the studies 
of the full course. There were 380 students in the regular school and 88 in the homeo- 
pathic. 
Detroit Medical School has taken its place with the advanced medical schools of the 
United States, having inaugurated changes which require a preliminary examination in 
English, mathematics, and ‘phy or all without evidence of high literary acquirements; 
anew course, to include 3 years of graded studies of 6 months each, with increased work 
in the laboratories during the first 2 courses ; obligatory attendance upon 3 regular terms, 
instead of 2 as heretofore ; the grading of both practical and didactic studies ; daily clini- 
cal work during the entire last course ; and a division of students into 3 distinctly graded 
classes.— (Announcement. ) 
The Michigan College of Medicine, Detroit, organized in 1880, announced for its session 
of 1881-82 that it had adopted a standard of matriculation examination sufficiently high 
to insure the admission of none but thoroughly prepared students, this standard being 
that of the general medical, council of Great Britain and Ireland. At the outset it 
adopted the graded system of teaching, and continued to require attendance on 3 graded. 
courses of 6 months each. In its first year there were over 60 students; in its second, 
76.— (Announcement. ) 
Dental.— The College of Dental Surgery of the University of Michigan reported a 3 
years’ graded course, and one of 2 years for those who could not complete the full course. 
For admission the candidate must be 18 years of age, must pass an examination in the 
ordinary English branches, or present a diploma from some college, academy, or high 
school, or must be a matriculate of the university. For graduation there must have been 
8 years of study, an attendance on 2 full courses of lectures in the college, the submis-

sion of a thesis upon some subject of the course, the showing of some professional work, 
and evidence of skill and ability in treating cases.— (Calendar. ) 
Pharmacy.— In the school of pharmacy, also connected with the university, applicants 
for admission not having diplomas from high schools or certificates of good standing in 
higher institutions must undergo an examination in English, mathematics, and Latin. 
For graduation the student must have completed a graded course of 2 years, covering 9 
months in each year and comprising daily recitations and lectures, work in the labora- 
tories of 3 to 4 hours daily through the 2 years, 3 semesters of analytical chemistry, 1 of 
microbotany, and 1 of pharmaceutical chemistry.— (Calendar. ) 
For statistics of the above professional schools, reference is made to Tables XI, XII, 
and XIII of the appendix, and summaries of these in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Michigan Institution for Educating the Deaf and Dumb, Flint, consists of 3 depart- 
ments (primary, with 5 grades; grammar, with 3; and academic, with 2), embracing the 
ordinary common school branches. In 1881 it was under 14 instructors, 2 being for semi- 
mutes and 1 a special teacher of articulation and lip reading. There were 249 students 
in attendance during the year, making 886 since its foundation. The boys were taught 
printing, cabinet and shoe making, and the girls various kinds of needlework.— (State 
report and return. ) 
The Evangelical Lutheran Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Norris, was under the con- 
trol of the aid society of that denomination. It had?3 instructors and 41 pupils, and gave 
instruction in the ordinary English studies, including religion, object teaching, and draw- 
ing.— (Return. ) 
The Class in Articulation for the Deaf, Marquette, reported as a private institution, under 
1 eee with 3 pupils, who were receiving training in the common English branches. 
(Return. 
The Michigan School for the Blind, Lansing, for 1880-’81 reported 23 instructors and 
employés and 63 pupils, making 72 since its opening in 1879. The method of imparting 
instruction was strictly oral. There were 55 in the literary department, while 33 were 
taught instrumental and 32 vocal music. In addition to the common English branches 
the pupils were instructed in civil government, botany, natural philosophy, and geology. 
The girls were taught sewing, mending, and knitting, the boys broom making. General 
information was given in evening readings by the teachers.— (State report and return.) 
EDUCATION OF POOR AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN. 
The State Public School for Dependent Children, Coldwater, reported in 1880-’81 as a 
“‘half-way house to a home,”’ receives children 3 to 12 yearsof age. The school was open 
11 months of the year; the children were in school 4} hours a day and at work 3 hours. 
‘There were 42 officers, teachers, and assistants, with an attendance of 284. The studies 
were arranged as primary, intermediate, and grammar, including reading, writing, arith- 
metic, drawing, music, &c. The boys were taught farming and shoemaking; the girls, 
sewing, knitting, and general housework. The system is the family and congregate com- 
bined. As families of 25 or 30 they live in cottages, over which preside cultivated ladies, 
and are together only at meals, in school, and at work. On reaching 16 the children are 
placed in families. Of the 1,081 received, the greater part were taken from poorhouses, 
and 525 had been indentured upto 1880, averagingabout 100 a year. By law the agent of 
the State board of correction and charities is the guardian of these children while minors.— 
(State report, return for 1880-81, and report of State board of correction and charities, 
1879-80.) 
The following private charities provide for the education of children in the common 
English branches, in the ordinary home industries, and provide homes in good families: 
The Protestant Orphan Asylum, Detroit, founded in 1840; the Industrial School, Detroit, 
established in 1857; the Home of the Friendless, founded in 1861; the two St. Vincent’s 
Orphan Asylums, Detroit, one established in 1853, the other, for male orphans, in 1868. 
In 1880 these institutions had from five to six hundred children under their care.— (Re- 
port of the board of correction and charities.) 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Michigan State Reform School, situated on a farm of 224 acres near Lansing, was re- 
ported to bedoing well. In 1880-81 there were 309 inmates, 158 having been received 
and 165 released. Whiletheaverage timeof keeping the boysin the institution was only 
2 years, those leaving were proving themselves more worthy of confidence than at any 
previous time. Aided by the county agents of the State board of correction and charities,

the superintendent had found homes for many of his boys. The main building was com- 
pleted, a spacious play-house nearly so, and a new chapel, for which $10,000 had been ap- 
propriated and which was to contain a reading and library room, in addition to the audi- 
ence room, was well under way. The aim in theschool room was to give each boy before 
leaving a fair knowledge of the common English branches, in connection with the usual 
industries of such institutions.— (State report.) 
The Michigan Reform School for Girls, Adrian, was opened on August 1, 1881. There 
were two cottages completed, with room for 64 pupils, and a building for chapel and 
school, with two additional cottages, was in course of erection. The course of study em- 
braced five classes, including penmanship and drawing; while botany, gardening, and 
light gymnastics received attention. Training in singing and systematic Bible study, 
” with daily moral lessons, entered into the plan of instruction. The forenoon of each day 
was devoted to domestic duties, while two hours of the afternoon and a portion of each 
evening were for school instruction. At date of report (October 1) there were 18 girls 
who were eager to learn and were making fair progress.— (State report. ) 
The Detroit House of Correction is a penal institution built and governed by the city 
of Detroit, the State legislature having enacted and approved a law for its organization 
in 1861. This institution is intermediate between the almshouse and State prison, receiv- 
ing young men between the ages of 16 and 22, and all females who shall, for the first 
time, be convicted of any crime, treason and murder excepted. It was sustained by its 
industries and had excellent school and chapel accommodations. The average number of 
ae was 500—400 males and 100 females.— (Report of board of correction and char- 
ities. 
The Michigan State House of Corregtion and Reformatory, established at Ionia in 1877, 
was originally limited to persons 16 to 25 and to criminals of lower grade than State 
prison offenders. By removal of all limitation of age and opening the institution for the 
committal of all disorderly persons, the reformatory has been substantially changed to a 
prison. During the year 889 were committed and 845 discharged. Of the whole number 
699 could read and write, while 85 had learned to read and 80 to write since entering. 
Ten hours a day were given to industrial pursuits, and one and one-half hours of each 
evening to school, where the common English branches were taught. In the shops the 
inmates were instructed in the manufacture of pails, tubs, and toy furniture, shoe and 
cigar making, carpentry, and masonry.— (Report of the State board of correction and 
charities and return.) 
INSTRUCTION OF CHILDREN IN POORHOUSES. 
Children from the county poorhouses in the State were in 1880-’81, as before, sent to 
the district schools until they could be accommodated at the State Public School at Cold- 
water. In one instance the poorhouse constituted the district school, and a qualified 
teacher was employed. One district voted not to allow the children of the poorhouse 
to attend the public school. In some counties no poor children were allowed to stay in 
the poorhouses, being either bound out or sent to the State school.— (Report of State board 
of correction and charities.) 
    
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
MICHIGAN STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-first annual meeting of this association was held at Lansing, December 
27-29, 1881, with 161 members. ‘The association was called to order the morning of the 
28th by the president, Austin George, and opened with devotional exercises by Prof. D. 
Putnam. The president then delivered an address on ‘‘The citizen of the world.””? This 
was followed by three papers on ‘‘The various relations sustained by the county board,’ 
“The grades and requirements for certificates,’” and ‘‘Examination in the theory and art 
of teaching.’’ The discussion which followed these concluded the morning session. In 
the afternoon the county examiners met, and, after considering various questions of inter- 
est, pledged their united efforts to make the new system of examination of teachers and 
supervision of schools a success throughout the State. At the afternoon session followed 
an address on ‘‘School boards, their responsibilities to the people and their duties to 
the schools.”? After the appointment of the usual committees, a paper was read on 
“‘A year’s experience in a departmental graded school,’’ which gave rise to warm discus- 
_sion. A committee on pedagogical text books reported a list of books which was adopted. 
The evening was devoted to music and an address on ‘‘The genius of industry.”” Dur- 
ing the morning session of the 29th, an address was given on ‘‘The educational system 
of Germany’? and a paper was read on “‘Our street gamins.’? In the afternoon this was 
followed by papers on ‘‘School hygiene” and ‘‘Industrial education.’”? The usual reso- 
lutions were then adopted, officers for the ensuing year elected, and the association ad- 
journed.— (State report. )

For an obituary notice of Rev. Erastus Otis Havens, D. D., LL. D., for 8 years connected 
with the University of Michigan as professor and president, see New York, pp. 191-2. 
GEORGE PALMER WILLIAMS, LL. D. 
This gentleman was born at Woodstock, Vt., in 1802, and after graduating at the uni- 
versity of that State in 1825 and spending two years at the Andover Theological Seminary, 
became principal of the preparatory grammar school of Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio, 
in 1828, where he remained till 1830, and then was chosen professor of languages in the 
Western University of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh. Returning to Gambier in 1832 he re- 
mained some years as principal of the senior department of the grammar school, and in 
1837 began his career as professor in the University of Michigan, first as manager of a 
branch at Pontiac and next at Ann Arbor, where for forty years he served successively 
as acting president, professor of ancient languages, and professor of mathematics and 
physics. By his accurate scholarship,his enthusiasm as a teacher, his warm benevo- 
lence, and the inspiring character of his christian virtues, he contributed largely to the 
growth of the university and the mental culture and moral advancement of generations 
of students, becoming, by his long and wise service, the Nestor of the institution. He 
died September 4, 1881, and the news of his death, it is said, ‘‘fell upon hundreds of 
hearts with the shock of a personal bereavement.’’— (State report, 1881.) 
HENRY PHILIP TAPPAN, D. D., LL. D. 
Dr. Tappan was born at Rhinebeck, N. Y., April 18, 1805. He graduated with high 
honors from Union College in 1825, and after three years at Auburn Theological Sem- 
inary, became pastor of the Congregational Church at Pittsfield, Mass. He remained 
here till 1831, when he sought to restore his impaired health by a trip to the West Indies. 
On his return in 1832, he accepted the chair of moral and intellectual philosophy in the 
University of the City of New York. At the end of six years he resigned, and spent much 
of the succeeding fourteen years in authorship, rising in the department of mental and 
moral science to a high rank among the thinkers of his day. In the autumn of 1852 he 
resumed his duties at the University of the City of New York, but soon after accepted 
the presidency of the University of Michigan, for which his valuable work on University 
Education had recommended him. The university being young and he the first presi- 
dent, he found a ready field for the application of his advanced theories asto the nature 
andscope of his ideal American university. Entering upon his work with zeal and hope- 
fulness, he marked out the lines along which its progress was to be secured, and then 
breathed into it the impulse of his own spirit. The breadth and comprehensiveness of 
the university system should be ascribed to President Tappan more than to any other 
single man. His connection with it ceased in 1863, from which time he resided mostly 
abroad, dying at Vevay, Switzerland, November 15, 1881.— (State report.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
There is for the State a superintendent of public instruction appointed by the gov- 
ernor, with consent of the senate, for two years, who has general charge of the public 
schools, is a member ex officio of the board of ten regents of the State university, acts 
as secretary of the board of directors of the State normal schools, and is associated 
with the governor and president of the university in a State high school board. 
For each county there is a superintendent of schools elected every two years; for com- 
mon school districts, a board of three trustees; for independent school districts, a board 
of six directors, who may appoint three competent persons as school examiners and may 
elect a superintendent of schools, who is ex officio a member of the board. The members 
of each board are chosen for three years, with annual change of one-third. Womenmay 
vote for school officers and hold school offices.— (School laws. )

MINNESOTA. 1383. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all resident youth of school age, and are sustained from 
the proceeds of a State school fund, from a county tax of 1 mill on $1, from the proceeds. 
of fines, estrays, and liquor licenses, and from an optional district tax not to exceed 9 
mills on $1 for schools or 10 mills for school-houses. The State money is apportioned 
to each county in proportion to the youth of school age actually enrolled in the public 
schools that have had three months’ term yearly taught by qualified teachers who have 
reported the statistics required by law. The amount derived from county tax is re- 
turned to each district in the exact sums collected in said district. Teachers must have 
certificates of qualification, to be legally employed, and cannot receive pay for the last 
month of service until their registers are properly filled out and returned to the district 
clerk. 
The State appropriates $3,000 annually to defray the expenses of teachers’ institutes. 
to be held by the State superintendent in the sparsely settled counties for one week, and 
of normal training schools for teachers in the thickly settled localities, continuing at 
least four weeks.— (School laws, 1877.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
From lack of a printed report giving the details of school work and legislation respecting 
it in 1880~’81, no full view of the general condition of school affairs for the year can be 
presented, and, as the superintendent died before completing his report, perhaps no com- 
plete account can ever be prepared. As far as the comparatively few statistics that have 
reached this Bureau go they show advance upon the whole, but an advance that seems 
hardly commensurate with the increase of population, of material development, and of 
wealth. Emigration from the more eastern States and Europe poured into the State. 
during the year and new agricultural regions were developed; but, with an unquestion~ 
ably large increase in children of school age, it appears from the returns received that 
there were 2,970 fewer children in the public schools. Still, the school accommodations 
were much improved, the time of schools was lengthened, the number of teachers was. 
increased, and many of the new ones had the advantage of good normal training in insti- 
tutes and normal schools. There was an increase of $385,748 in the permanent State 
school fund and of $151,286 in the school income, yet this seems to have led to increased 
expenditure only in building or repairing school-houses and giving teachers higher wages, 
the whole expenditure decreasing by $239,622. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The first school of this class in the State was established in 1868 at St. Paul, and 
reported for 1881 7 teachers and 60 pupils. Kindergiirten established later at Minne- 
apolis and Winona each report from 30 to 40 in attendance. For further statistics, see 
Table V of the appendix, and a summary of the same in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding.— (Returns, 1881.) 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
Under a general law, all cities, towns, and villages organized into independent school 
districts since 1877 must have boards of education of six directors, elected by the people 
for terms of thfee years, with provision for annual change of two members. Certain 
cities are organized under special laws and vary as to their school boards. Each board 
may elect a city superintendent, who becomes by such election a member of the board. 
and chief executive officer of the schools.— (School law, 1877.)

134 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF FDUCATION, 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Minneapolis divided her schools (which were taught for 185 days) into primary, gram- 
mar, and high, and had 15 school buildings (an increase of 1 during the year), contain- 
ing 5,500 sittings for study, valued with sites and furniture at $418,104. An increase of 
13 teachers, of 3,794 children of school age, of 578 enrolled in public schools, and of 227 
in average attendance, appears for 1881. Drawing was taught by a special teacher.— 
(Return, 1881.) 
St. Paul for 1881 reports 14 buildings (2 of them erected and 1 enlarged at a cost 
of $70,000 during the year), with 3,728 sittings, all valued at $254,000. The schools in- 
cluded all grades from primary to high and were taught 198 days by the 102 teachers. 
The enrolment for 1881 was the same as for 1880, with an increase of 485 in average daily 
attendance. Special teachers were employed for music, drawing, and penmanship. An 
enrolment of 1,800 in private and church schools is given. An evening school opened by 
the board of education had an enrolment of 212.— (Return, 1881, and Journal of Edu- 
cation, October 20, 1881.) 
Stillwater sends no report for 1881. 
Winona reports 3 buildings for graded schools and 1 for a high school, with 1,918 sit- 
tings, valued, with grounds, &c., at $180,200. An increase of 49 in enrolment and of 219 
in daily attendance is noted. Special instruction is reported in drawing and penmanship 
and an enrolment of 350 in private schools.— (Return, 1881.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
  STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
This State has 3 normal schools, one at Winona (opened in 1860), another at Mankato 
(in 1868), and a third at St. Cloud (in 1869). To each in 1881 it gave $12,000, which 
seems to have been supplemented from some other sources. The normal school board at 
its semiannual meeting toward the close of 1881 reported all to be prosperous beyond the 
experience of any former year. Each appears to have an elementary course of 2 years 
and an advanced course of the same length, these overlapping for a year, so that those who 
go continuously through have only a3 years’ course. Winona has also a professional 
class for those who pass examinations in the academic studies of either course and who 
are willing to give another year to the philosophy and history of education, methods of 
teaching, school economy, &¢. Italso retained the Kindergarten training formerly reported 
in the model or practice school which it maintained, the others also having model schools, 
but without the Kindergarten. The 3 report to this Bureau for 1880-’81 a total of 32 
teachers, 539 normal students, and 369 others, with 81 graduates for the year. < some- 
what larger number of students, probably including some counted twice, was Teported 
to the normal school board. All report instryction in drawing and vocal music, labo- 
ratories for chemical experiments, apparatus for illustrating physics, and model schools 
for practice teaching.— (Reports and returns. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
A State teachers’ institute was held at the Winona Normal School during the month of 
May, 1881. It was an earnest working institute, with 134 teachers in attendance, 77 of 
them students that had been connected with the school during the year. Mostof the 
work was done in sections, under the instruction of the regular faculty of the school, with 
special teachers of penmanship and voice culture. ; 
By a recent act’of the legislature institute work has been reorganized in the State, and 
1 teacher from each normal school has been appointed institute instructor, to be assisted 
by the county superintendent of each county where an institute is held. The institute 
instructor of the Winona school reports 3 institutes of 2 weeks each held by him during 
the year. From those of the other schools no report appears up to the date of going to 
press.— (Minnesota Journal of Education and normal school reports. ) 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Courses of instruction in botany, chemistry, and geology were given at the University 
of Minnesota during July, 1881, principally to offer to the teachers of the State an op- 
portunity to still better prepare themselves for teaching the sciences. Normal courses 
were offered in the Minneapolis Academy, Minneapolis; High Forest Methodist Episcopal 
Seminary, High Forest; and atGustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter. Classes for instruc- 
tion in methods of teaching are reported to be formed at the beginning of each term at: 
Rochester English and Classical School, Rochester.— (Catalogues, 1881.) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Minnesota Journal of Education, published monthly, issued its first number in 
December, 1881. It promises to be a useful journal, devoted to the cause of education, 
and will be the official organ of the State superintendent of public instruction.

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
By act of the legislature approved March, 1881, the governor, superintendent of public 
instruction, and the president of the University of Minnesota were constituted a board 
of commissioners for the encouragement of higher education and called the ‘‘high school 
board.’’ The act provides $400 annually to be paid to any public graded school in any 
city or village which shall give free preparatory instruction according to the provisions of 
this act; that is, have a regular course of study embracing all branches requisite for ad- 
mission to the collegiate department of the University of Minnesota. A supplementary 
act of November, 1881, grants the high school board full discretionary power to consider 
and act upon all applications of schools for State aid, and further provides that not more 
than 3 schools shall be aided in each county inanyone year. A school once accepted and 
continuing to comply with the law shall receive aid not less than 3 years. By an organ- 
ized system of written examinations on the studies of the ‘‘college preparatory course’’ 
every pupil who passes successfully is to be entitled to a certificate of admission to the 
State University without further examination in the study orstudies named. In Decem- 
ber, 1881, the board reported 36 high schools that had complied with the requirements 
and were receiv: ‘ing aid.— (Calendar of University of Minnesota, 1881.) 
  SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (non-sectarian), offers free instruction to all 
persons over 14 years of age who may pass the required examinations. The board of 
regents, which has control of the university, is authorized by law to establish any de- 
sired number of departments or colleges, 6 having been specified; a department of ele- 
mentary instruction, otherwise called ‘the collegiate department;”’ a department of 
science, literature, and the arts; a college of agriculture; a college of mechanic arts; a 
department of medicine, and a department of law. The first 4 have been established. 
A 3 years’ course in the elementary department is introductory to the final 2 years’ 
courses of the 3 other departments named. 
The legislature of 1881 appropriated $30,000 a year for six years for the erection and 
outfit of additional buildings, viz: a farm house, a building for the college of mechanic 
arts, a military building, an astronomical observatory, a museum, and a library; but the 
great expense incurred by the State in rebuilding the State capitol, destroyed by fire in 
March, 1881, has led the board of regents to delay, for a time, the erection of any of 
these bufdings.— (Calendar for 1881.) 
The other colleges reported for 1881 are Hamline University, Hamline (Methodist Epis- 
copal), Augsburg Seminary, Minneapolis (Evangelical Lutheran), each having a prepar- 
atory department and a 4 years’ course, either classical or scientific; Macalester College, 
Minneapolis (Presbyterian), with only a preparatory school at present; and Carleton 
College, Northfield (Congregational), still maintaining its former high standard, with a 
preparatory department and 4 courses of study of 4 years each. St. John’s College, Col- 
legeville (Roman Catholic), is believed to maintain still its classical, scientific, commer- 
cial, and ecclesiastical courses, although not heard from. — (Catalogues and returns, 1881.) 
For statistics, see Table IX of the :ppendix, and summary of the same in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN.    
The University of Minnesota, Carleton College, and Hamline University, above referred 
to, admit young women to all their privileges. Two other schools, offering collegiate 
training to women only, report for some part of 1881, viz: St. Mary’ 's Hall, Faribault 
(Protestant Episcopal), and Bennet Seminary, Minneapolis (non-sectarian). Both pre- 
sent ample teaching force, with preparatory English and respectable collegiate courses, 
the latter of 4 years. For separate statistics, see Table VIII of appendix; for a summary 
of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The University of Minnesota, Carleton College, Hamline University, St. John’s Col- 
lege, and Augsburg Seminary offer special scientific courses. 
The State University, in its college of agriculture, has an elementary course agreeing 
with the regular scientific, and an advanced course giving special training in the sciences 
relating to agriculture and leading to an appropriate degree. Its college of mechanic 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
  136 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
arts has 3 courses of 2 years each, to which graduates in the scientific course or others 
passing the required examinations are admitted. The graduates are entitled to appro- 
priate degrees in civil or mechanical engineering and in architecture. Special courses in 
shop work, drawing, &c., and an evening course in mechanical drawing for mechanics 
and apprentices have been established. Instruction in military science is given to the pre- 
paratory class and the first 2 collegiate classes. 
Carleton College has been made a United States signal station and has an observatory 
supplied with all the necessary apparatus for meteorological observations and the study 
of astronomy. It also has a “science building,’’ with all modern appliances for the pur- 
suit of scientific studies and a course of higher mathematics.— (Catalogues, 1881.) 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology, in courses of 3 years, is taught at Seabury Divinity School, Faribault (Prot- 
estant Episcopal), and Augsburg Seminary, Minneapolis (Evangelical Lutheran), andina 
4 years’ course at St. John’s College, Collegeville (Roman Catholic). All have arrange- 
ments for preparatory training in the case of those who are not college graduates and can- 
not take a collegiate course; but at the Seabury School, at least, such a courseis expected 
and is earnestly recommended to all that have not taken it.— (Catalogues and circulars. ) 
Law is eventually to be taught at the State University, but this department had not in 
1881 been established, and there were no other law schools reported for that year. 
Medicine is also to have its department at the University; but, this not being set on 
foot, the Minnesota College Hospital, Minneapolis, has been adopted as the title of a medi- 
cal school of the ‘‘regular’’ type, organized October 17, 1881, in that city, which absorbed 
the St. Paul Medical College, organized the preceding year, and was opened for instruc- 
“tion in the hospital building, Minneapolis, November 1, 1881. All applicants for in- 
struction are required to subject themselves to the usual 3 years of tutelage and to pass a 
preliminary examination, unless graduates of a high school. The course appears to be a 
3 years’ graded one, the annual lecture course covering, however, only the minimum 20 
weeks of the American Medical College Association, instead of the 8 months annually, 
which is reported to have been the yearly term of the St. Paul Medical College, out of 
which this grew. More than 30 students are said to have entered for the first year.— 
(Letter from the dean and advertisement in the Minnesota Journal of Education.) 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB ANI®THE BLIND. 
The Minnesota Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, 
Faribault, sent in a biennial report for 1879-}80, and no later information has@een re- 
ceived in regard to the deafand dumb. At that time there were 7 instructors and 134 
pupils. A return for 1881 from the department for the blind gives the number of instruc- 
tors and employés as 11, pupils 28, making 57 since the opening in 1866. All receive in- 
struction in the common English branches, with such higher English instruction as may 
be called for and such industries as are suited to their conditions. Lessons in drawing 
and in articulation to such as are capable of receiving them are given to the deaf and 
dumb. Music (vocal and instrumental), point writing, and the use of the type writer are 
taught the blind.— (Report, 1880; return, 1881.) 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
‘The Minnesota Experimental School for Imbeciles, Faribault, established in 1879, issued 
its first biennial report in 1881, showing that 25 pupils had been received during the 2 
years and that 21 were still in attendance. The progress in school work and the general 
improvement in the children are encouraging alike to teachers and parents, and prove the 
present and prospective value of this school to the State.— (Report, 1881.) 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Minnesota State Reform School, St. Paul, in its biennial report for 1879-80, gives 
119 inmates in November, 1880, who were taught the common English branches 4 hours 
a day 5 days in the week, the hours out of school being spent in learning some useful 
trade by which they might earn an honest living on leaving the institution. No later 
returns have been received.— (Report, 1879-’80.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
MINNESOTA STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Notice was given that the meeting of this association was to be held at Lake City, 
August 15, 1881, but no account of its proceedings has reached this Bureau, and it is 
supposed that the death of Superintendent. Burt may have prevented the holding of 
the session.

CONVENTION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The first number of the new Minnesota Journal of Education, December, 1881, gave 
notice that the county superintendents of schools were to meet at St. Paul, December 
27-29, and to discuss the examination and grading of teachers, making visitations profit- 
able, improvement of teachers, economizing time of country schools, the practicability 
and advantage of grading country schools. Subsequent numbers of the journal give 
no account of what was done. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
HON. DAVID BURT. 
The late Hon. David Burt, superintendent of public instruction, was born in Monson, 
Mass., August 2, 1822, and “graduated from Oberlin College in 1847; he afterward en- 
tered Andover Theological Seminary (Congregational), and graduated therefrom in 1851. 
His entire life was occupied i in ministerial or educational work. On account of bronchial 
troubles, which were the final cause of his death, he removed to Winona, Minn., and 
accepted a pastorate in 1858. He served on the board of the State normal schools; was. 
a member of the State Teachers’ Association; was superintendent of schools for the 
county of Winona, and in 1875 was appointed State superintendent of public instruction. 
He died at his home in Northfield, Minn., September 13, 1881, having then served three 
full terms as State superintendent and about four months of a fourth term, and having 
done much toward the fuller organization of the school system of the State and the de- 
velopment of the high s¢hool as a link between the lower schools and the university.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. . 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of public education is elected quadriennially by popular vote, 
who also acts as president of the State board of education, the other members being the 
secretary of state and attorney general. County superintendents are appointed by the 
State board, with the advice of the senate, after examination by a county board ap- 
pointed for that purpose every four years.1 At an annual meeting of the patrons of each   
1 This board is composed of three persons, one chosen by the judge of the circuit court, one by the chancellor of the chancery district in which the county lies, and the third by the board of super- visors of the county. At least two of those selected must be professional educators.
-P-A-G-E-417
MISSISSIPPI. 139 
school three persons from among their number are elected trustees for the school, except 
in towns of 1,000 or more inhabitants, constituting a separate district, in which the 
mayor, aldermen, and county superintendent have control. i 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
  The public schools are free to all persons of school age (5-21) in the State and are 
to be taught at least four months of 20 days each. Separate schools, with equal advan- 
tages, are required for the two races, with not more than two schools for each color in 
any township, unless by the concurrence of the board of supervisors and county super- 
intendent. ‘To sustain the schools, the proceeds of the public school fund, of the sale of 
lands forfeited to the State, of liquor licenses and fines, with those from poll taxes not 
to exceed $2 a head, are distributed among the several counties, according to the num- 
ber of educable children. To the share of this which falls to a township are to be added 
the proceeds of sixteenth section lands. Each district! may levy a tax of not more than 
three mills on the dollar to assist in maintaining its public schools, and in towns consti- 
tuting a separate district an additional levy may be made for fuel and other necessaries. 
‘Teachers must hold certificates from the county superintendent and must be paid accord- 
ing to the grade of their certificate and number of children attending at a rate fixed by 
law. Cities and towns may give additional compensation. Text books agreed upon by 
the teachers and supervisors of each county cannot be changed within 5 years. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics for 1880-’81 show, on the whole, very fair advance in the work of edu- 
cating the children of the State. Receipts and expenditures for public schools fell off, 
perhaps because of the extensive inundations which paralyzed the industries of several 
counties. The number of white pupils enrolled in the public schools and the average 
term of schools in cities also decreased, presumably from the same cause. But with these 
exceptions and a slight decline in the valuation of the State school fund, all seems to 
have been improvement. More teachers by 489 were employed, at about the same rate 
of pay, and although the number of colored youth of school age ran 12,005 below the 
enumeration of the previous year, 1,923 more colored pupils were in the State schools, so 
that, notwithstanding a decline of 1,289 in enrolment of whites, the average monthly at- 
tendance in State schools went 9,680 beyond that of 1879-80, and the average daily at- 
tendance 3,303 beyond; the average time of county schools was prolonged 3} days. This 
is a creditable record for a year of great calamity, and indicates increasing interest in 
the public schools on the part of a large class of the population, and especially on the 
part of those who most need the advantages those schools afford. 
PEABODY FUND AID. 
The agent of the Peabody fund trustees allotted to Mississippi $3,950 in aid of the 
State system for 1881. Of this amount $2,750 went for the training of specially selected 
teachers for the State in the normal college at_ Nashville, Tenn., $200 for training other 
teachers in the school of the State at Holly Springs, and $1,000 for training of all the 
employed teachers in institutes. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
Any incorporated town of 1,000 or more inhabitants may constitute a separate school 
district if the mayor and aldermen so elect. They are to appoint three persons as school 
trustees, who shall hold office one year and look after the interests of the schools. The 
county superintendent is to have the same jurisdiction over city as over county schools. 
Vicksburg (the only city that in 1880-’81 had 7,500 or more inhabitants), under a spe- 
cial act of 1878, has a school board of .2 trustees foe each ward, chosen by the people 
for terms of two years.— (School laws of 1878 and 1880.) 
STATISTICS OF VICKSBURG. 
The United States census of 1880 reported a population of 11,814. Local reports for 
1880-81 give a total of 3,671 youth of school age, of whom 1,180 were enrolled in public 
schools and 600 in private or church schools. ‘The public schools were taught in 2 school 
buildings, with 23 rooms, valued, with sites, furniture, and apparatus, at $12,650, and 
affording accommodations for 1,200 pupils, thus more than meeting the needs of the en- 
rolment. They were taught 190 days by 21 teachers, and had in average daily attend- 
ance 812 pupils out of the 1,180 on the rolls. The whole annual expenditure for the 
schools was $21,446, about $15.77 per capita of average attendance.— (Return. )

    140 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The Mississippi State Normal School, Holly Springs, established in 1870, and meant to 
train teachers for the public schools, reports for 1881 a 4 years’ course of study, 3 in- 
structors, and 137 students. The standard of the school is said to be annually raised, 
and a decrease of 87 in attendance is ascribed to the fact that a class of 52 members was 
cut out of the course, thus leaving 4 classes and but one course of study, with all the 
studies compulsory. Students who are unable to make the necessary advancement are 
hereafter to be dismissed. Tuition is free to pupils of the State who will agree-to teach 
for a period of 3 years; students from other States are charged $2.a month. Text books 
are free toall.— (Catalogue, 1881.) 
Tougaloo University and State Normal School, Tougaloo, reports a 5 years’ English course 
and 3 years’ higher normal; 8 resident instructors; 247 students, 54 of them being in the 
normal classes. A cottage for the president and 2 large buildings for the use of students 
were completed during the year 1881, one of them to replace a boys’ dormitory burned; 
the other, a girls’ hall; and various minor improvements were made.— (Catalogue, 1881.) 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The normal department of Shaw University, Holly Springs, which reports no State appro- 
priation for 1880-’81, makes return for that year of 74normal students, under 5 instructors, 
in a course that covers 3 years.— (Return. ) 
Natchez Seminary, Natchez, for normal and theological training of colored students 
under Baptist influences, reports, for the same year, 94 normal students under 4 instruc- 
tors in a 5 years’ course.— (Return and printed report.) i 
Union Female College, Oxford, has a normal department in which instruction is said to 
be given in methods of teaching, of school organization and school management, the classes 
of the preparatory department of the college serving as a model and practiceschool. In 
1879-80 there were 7 young ladies engaged in these exercises, under how many instructors 
is not distinctly stated.— (Catalogue. ) 
  TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The school law of Mississippi makes no provision for the holding of teachers’ institutes; 
but through aid from the Peabody fund the State superintendent, ably assisted by three 
professors, held a series of institutes in various portions of the State during the year with 
excellent results. The attendance of teachers and citizens generally was good, and re- 
newed interest in the cause of education followed in the localities where they were 
held.— (State report, 1880-’81.) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
No educational serial has been reported as published in this State since 1876, but a 
Mississippi department in the American Journal of Education, published in St. Louis, 
appeared March, 1881, and is still continued under the charge of J. M. Barrow. It is 
devoted to the improvement of the public schools and aims especially to benefit the nor- 
mal schools and teachers’ institutes.— (American Journal of Education, March, 1881.) 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Since 1878 the law has recognized private academies and colleges having suitable 
school buildings, libraries of not less than 200 volumes of good literature, and a faculty 
of good standing as substantially public high schools qualified to prepare students for 
the university, and for such students makes an allowance equal to the estimated cost of 
their instruction in the public schools. Academies and colleges are to make a full 
monthly report to the county superimtendent of students of this class, and upon this re- 
port they receive for the month reported $2 for each student. Such schools and colleges 
must have a course of text books preparatory to those used in the University of Missis- 
sippi, so that students may pass from these schools to the university without loss of time 
or text books. It was further enacted in 1878 that a graded honor roll be opened in the 
university for students entering from these schools, and that at their request a report be 
furnished the principals of schools showing the character of preparation of the students. 
The catalogues of the university make no mention of classes thus received, and no special 
high school reports have been received at this Bureau.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Mississippi, Oxford (non-sectarian), comprehends 3 general depart- 
ments, namely, one of preparatory education, or the university high school, covering 3 
years; one of science, literature, and the arts, covering 4 years; and one of professional ed- 
ucation, covering but asingle year. No change in courses of study or general management 
was reported for 1881; it was announced that women were to be admitted to the univer- 
sity, with all its privileges, in September, 1882. The college of liberal arts had for 1880~’81 
11 professors, 192 students (including 3 resident graduates); the preparatory department, 
3 instructors and 137 students. 
Mississippi College, Clinton (Baptist), organized in 1851, for men only, had a preparatory 
department and 8 schools: in the sciences, mental, moral, and natural; in Greek, Latin, 
and modern languages; in English; and a commercial school, with the addition of military 
drill and training for such as desired it. Except in the preparatory department there 
are no regular courses of study; degrees are conferred when the prescribed studies have 
been mastered, not when a fixed course of study has been passed through. For 1881 it 
pore 235 students in all its schools, 105 of them in collegiate studies.— (Catalogue and 
return. 
Shaw University, Holly Springs (Methodist Episcopal), admitting both sexes and hay- 
ing preparatory courses of 1 and 2years, with classical and scientific of 4 years and normal 
of 3 years, had 290 students in its preparatory classes and 23 in collegiate, under 6 in- 
structors.— (Catalogue and return. ) 
_Alcorn University, Rodney (non-sectarian), largely if not wholly for colored pupils, with 
a preparatory course of 2 years and an agricultural and literary, each of 4 years, had 
170 students in the preparatory and 15 in the collegiate literary course for the session of 
1880-’81.— (Catalogue and return. ) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Nine schools of this class, out of 11 believed to exist, report in some form for 1880-81, 
all showing arrangements for preparatory training, and several beginning this with ele- 
mentary English studies. All had, too, advanced English courses, and most of them 
classical, usually of 4 years, though some indicate an arrangement by which each special 
branch of study is taught in a separate school and graduation made to depend on profi- 
ciency in a majority of these studies without reference to a fixed period. In at least 6, 
vocal and instrumental music was taught; in 7, drawing and painting, usually with one 
or two modern languages, with some liberty of choice between these and the ancient.— 
(Catalogues and returns.) 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Scientific courses of 4 years, but apparently of very different grades of thoroughness, 
are to be found in the several collegiate institutions of the State. 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Mississippi, Starkville, organized October 6, 
1880, reported for 1881 a 4 years’ course of study in scientific agriculture, horticulture, 
engineering, &c., with 5 instructors and 267 students in the preparatory and 6 professors 
and 87 students in the scientific department.— (Catalogue and return, 1881.) 
Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, the State institution for scientific instruc- 
tion of young colored men, makes no special report of progress in scientific work for 1881. 
Literary and scientific courses of 4 years, with 2 years’ preparatory for each, are given. 
At Tougaloo University, Tougaloo, also for colored pupils, agricultural and horticultural 
instruction continued to be given as far as the limited means of the institution would 
allow.— (Catalogue and return.) 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology was taught to some extent in 1880-’81, as previously, at the Bishop Green 
Associate Mission and Training School, Dry Grove; at Shaw University, Holly Springs, 
and at the Natchez Seminary, Natchez. At the first the training was mainly preparatory 
to a regular theological course; at the second, the theological instruction seems to have 
been given as a side study in connection with a full or partial collegiate course; at the 
third, essentially the same system as at Shaw seems to have prevailed, but in connection 
with a lower line of studies. At Shaw, 25 students were reported as theological in 
1879-’80; at Natchez, 20 in 1880-81. Teachers specially theological were not indicated 
in either case.— (Catalogues and returns. ) 
Law was studied by 18 students in 1880-81 in the one year’s course of the University 
of Mississippi under 1 professor and 5 lecturers.— (Catalogue of university.)

142 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Jackson, was reported to be 
in a prosperous condition in 1881. Since 1879 there had been 92 pupils under instrue 
tion, of whom 78 were on the roll during the year and 67 were in attendance at its close; 
the principal, having retired, had been succeeded by another. The manual system had 
been in use, but, about 25 per cent. of the pupils being semimutes, the need of an articu- 
lation teacher was felt. The grounds being small and no facilities available for learning 
trades, the boys cannot find steady employment; the girls receive special instruction in 
dressmaking and the use of the sewing machine and are able to doall the sewing forthe 
institution.— (American Annals, 1881.) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The biennial report of the Asylum for the Blind for 1880-’81 has not been received. 
The return for 1880 reported 32 pupils. The usual English branches were taught; also, 
broom and mattress making, chair seating, and upholstery. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
MISSISSIPPI STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
An act approved March, 1878, requires the holding of an annual convention of the prin- 
cipals and presidents of high Schools and colleges acting as high schools, to be styled 
“The Teachers’ Association of the State of Mississippi.” This association met at Jack- 
son, December 27, 1881. Every educational interest of the State was represented, from 
the common school to the State university. The principal subjects discussed were teach- 
ers’ institutes, normal schools, and more efficient local supervision by superintendents. 
The improvement of the common schools seemed to be the aim and desire of all members 
of the association.— (American Journal of Education, 1882.)

  144 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the State, a superintendent of public schools, elected for 4 years, who is ex officio 
« member and president of the State board of education and a member of the board of 
i1egents of each State normal school; for each county, a school commissioner, elected at 
the annual meeting for 2 years; for school districts, boards of directors of 3 members, who 
appoint a district clerk.— (Laws. ) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The law provides for the establishment of public schools free to all persons 6 to 20 years 
of age, to be supported by taxation; not less than 25 per cent. of the annual State revenue 
must be used for the public schools. The State money is apportioned to each county ac- 
cording to the enumeration of persons of 5-21 years. No district, city, or town that fails 
to maintain a free school for 3 months during the year, or to make and return the re- 
quired enumeration, may receive any portion of the school fund. Local taxes are not to 
exceed 40 cents on $100 for school purposes, except that by a majority vote of taxpayers 
65 cents may be allowed in country districts and $1 in citiesor towns. By a two-thirds 
vote these rates may be further increased for the purchase ofa site or erection of a school- 
house. In districts containing 16 or more colored youth, separate schools must be estab- 
lished for them, to be taught by colored teachers, if competent. To such schools persons 
over 21 may be admitted. Contiguous districts may unite in the provision of these 
school advantages where the number in each falls below the minimum. lI teachers in 
public schools must hold certificates from the State superintendent or from the school 
commissioner of the county in which they are to be employed; and to receive their pay, 
they must make monthly reports of all required statistics and a summary report for the 
whole term at its close.— (School law of 1879.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
It has been found impossible to secure any official statement of the educational condi- 
tion of Missouri for 1881. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The report of the St. Louis city schools shows that in 1880-’81 there were in those 
schools 4,718 under exclusively Kindergarten instruction and 3,917 under primary and 
Kindergarten combined. The former were nearly all under the school age, and therefore 
would have failed to get instruction from the city but for these child-gardens. Of the 
whole 8,635 enrolled, 4,505 remained at the close of the year and 3,926 were in average 
daily attendance. 
For any other Kindergiirten reported, see Table V of the appendix. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
Any city, town, or village may be organized into an independent school district with 
a board of six directors elected for 3 years, who choose a president, secretary, and treas- 
urer of their own number and are designated as a board of education. Cities elect a city 
school superintendent, and under special charter may increase the number of directors.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
Hannibal reported 28 graded schools, located in 8 buildings, with 1,590 sittings, 
valued, with sites, furniture, &c., at $38,700. The schools were taught 190 days. An 
enrolment of 300 in private schools is reported.— (Return, 1881.) 
Kansas City classed its public schools as primary, grammar, and high, the first two oceu- 
pying seven years each. The high school, which admits both white and colored youth, 
had two courses, one general and the other classical; in the first, Latin and modern lan- 
guages were taught; in the last, Latin and Greek. The erection of one new building and 
the enlargement of others raised the number of school rooms from 76 to 87, thus afford- 
ing accommodations for an increase of 1,433 pupils in the enrolment. Progress and im- 
provement are reported in all departments, discipline especially having become better, 
although 93 cases of corporal punishment were reported. The 5 evening schools had an 
enrolment of 182.— (Report and return, 1881.) 
St. Joseph, having a school population increased by 944, purchased a site, erected one 
new building, and enlarged and repaired others at a cost of $15,100. In J uly, 1881, it 
reported 20 buildings in all, containing 62 rooms for study and recitation and 1 for reci- 
tation only, with 3,455 sittings. -The schools were taught 198days. The per cent. of at- 
tendance on average enrolment in the high school was 97; in all the schools, 92. Special 
teachers of penmanship, drawing, French, and German were employed, penmanship being 
taught as a regular study even as far up as the first year’s class in the high school, and 
drawing in all the classes. Estimated enrolment in private schools, 625.— (Report and 
return for 1880--’81.) 
St. Louis grades its schools from Kindergarten through 8 grades to the high school, 
and supports a normal school, which is for girls only. An enrolment of 2,996 in Kin- 
dergirten, 2,384 in evening schools, and 21,000 in private and parochial schools is given. 
A decrease is reported in the number of schools, in the number of teachers, in enrolment, 
and in average attendance; this loss fell mainly on the evening schools, of which there 
were 29 in 1880, with 91 teachers and 4,539 pupils, while in 1881 there were only 11, 
with 40 teachers and 2,384 pupils. The reasons for this reduction appear to have been 
partly want of means for supporting more schools and partly indifference of pupils. For 
theaccommodation of the 106,372 youth of schoolage, the report shows that there were 103 
buildings, affording seats for only 42,610, one building less than in 1879 and but 350 more 
sittings than in that year. Great overcrowding of course resulted. In consequence of 
the inability of the board to provide additional accommodations there was little change 
in teachers, except in evening schools and Kindergirten, those in the former decreasing 
by 51, those in the latter increasing by 32. It is intended to prepare, as far as possible, 
all young children in the Kindergarten for subsequent school work. In continuation of 
a plan inaugurated 2 years ago German-English teachers were largely substituted for 
special teachers of German. This has rendered possible a reduction of about $17,000 in 
the expenses for instruction during the two years, with a prospect of still further decrease 
in 1881-’82. The courses and grades of schools continue substantially as previously 
reported. 
Sedalia, classifying its schools in 7 grades below the high school (in which there were 4 
grades), had 5 buildings, containing 26 rooms with 1,619 sittings, valued, with sites, &c., 
at $74,200. Schools were in session 179 days. The average per cent. of attendance in 
white schools was 91.8, in colored 87; per cent. of punctuality, white pupils 99.01, col- 
ored 97,87, teachers 98.53. Music was taught by a special teacher. During the year every 
school room was furnished with a complete set of writing charts and all necessary outline 
maps, the course of study was revised, and marked improvement is said to have been 
made in the study and use of language. Private schools enrolled 250 pupils.— (Report 
and return for 1880—’81.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The State maintains 6 normal schools, one connected with the State University at Co- 
lumbia, another with the State College at Rolla, and 3 others for white students in the 
northern, the western, and the southeastern portions of the State, called first, second, and 
third district normal schools, located at Kirksville, Warrensburg, and Cape Girardeau. 
The sixth school, Lincoln Institute, Jefferson City, is for the education of colored teachers. 
The district normals are under the control of boards of regents of 7 members, 6 ap- 
pointed by the governor for 6 years, with biennial change oF 2, and the State superin- 
tendent as an ex officio member of each board. The 4 years’ course of study is substan- 
tially the same in the 3 district schools. Elementary classes are formed twice a year; 
advanced classes, once. Teachers’ certificates, good for 2years throughout the State, are 
given at the completion of the first 2 years; certificates for 3 years, at the completion of 
10 & 
   
-P-A-G-E-424
    146 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
an additional year’s study; and both a State certificate and diploma, with appropriate de- 
gree, to all students taking the full 4 years’ course. A post graduate diploma is given 
at Kirksville to such alumni as teach with decided success for 2 years. Kirksville re- 
ported 11 instructors and 492 students for 1881, with 11 graduates, 8 of whom engaged 
in teaching. Warrensburg had 9 instructors and lecturers and 390 students, with 40 
graduates in the elementary and 18 in the advanced course. Cape Girardeau had a 
faculty of 9 members, 229 students, and a graduating class of 19, of whom 15 became 
teachers. : 
The dean of the normal department of the State University, at Columbia, is a 
lady, who also acts as professor of pedagogics; she has the assistance of 14 other instruc- 
tors. A preparatory examination in English studies, with a grade of at least 80 on 100, 
is required, and then the completion of the 2 years’ ‘‘public school’’ normal course of 
study, to obtain the elementary degree of principal in pedagogics. A higher degree, 
bachelor of pedagogics, is conferred on regular graduates of the university who supple- 
ment their collegiate work by taking the last year’s studies of the normal course. A. 
still higher degree, master of pedagogics (‘‘the highest and most scholarly degree of the 
university’’), is awarded only to those who sustain examinations in the 5 university schools 
of science and in any 4 of its 5 schools of languages. The normal school at Rolla has a 
“‘teacher’s course’? covering two years, each year being under the charge of a special 
teacher, whether with other aid or not does not appear. The graduates from these 2 
schools receive from the State superintendent certificates good throughout the State, 
those for the graduates at Rolla good for 2 years; those for graduates from the lower 
course of the university school, for 3 years; from the ‘higher courses, for life. At the 
university for 1880-’81 there were 82 students in the normal school, in a six years’ 
course, of whom 14 were graduated, 6 of these holding academic or other degrees; 13 
of its 14 graduates in 1881 engaged in teaching. Of the attendance at Rolla no report 
has been received.— (Reports and returns. ) 
Lincoln Institute has a 5 years’ preparatory and 4 years’ normal course. Students 
completing the full course are entitled to a diploma, and, if their general average schol- 
arship in the normal department be 85 per cent., to aState certificate given by the State 
superintendent. There were reported 5 graduates in the full course and 5 in the prepar- 
atory for 1881.— (Catalogues and returns. ) 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The St. Louis City Normal School, intended for the training of young women to teach 
in the city public schools, had a one year’s course of study, since extended so as to cover 
two years, but requires four years of high school work, or its equivalent, as a preparation 
for admission. One of the best arranged district schools in the city has been placed un- 
der the supervision of the normal principal, and is used as a school of observation and 
visited weekly by the normal pupils, while higher class pupils fill vacancies in district 
‘schools, and thus get valuable experience. For 1881 an attendance of 134 students, 
with 67 graduates, is reported.— (State report, 1880; city report and return, 1881.) 
The Northwest Missouri Normal School, Oregon, reported a four years’ course, with 2 in- 
structors, 78 students, and 2 graduates. The principal states that it is in fact only a 
high school department of the public school, but is not a free school.— (Return, 1881.) 
Normalcourses were also reported in 1881 at Avalon College, Avalon; Southwest Bap- 
tist College, Bolivar; Christian University, Canton; Grand River College, Edinburg; 
Mt. Pleasant College, Huntsville; Kirkwood Seminary, Kirkwood; La Grange College, 
La Grange; Collegiate Institute, Sedalia; Drury College, Springfield; Stewartsville Col- 
lege, Stewartsville; and Central Wesleyan College, Warrenton.— (Catalogues. ) 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The law requires the school board of a village, town, or city to establish, as soon as 
its means will permit, an adequate number of primary schools and the necessary schools 
of a higher grade, in which studies may be pursued not provided for in the primary 
grades. There is no special information as to the number of such schools established, a 
few cities only making a report. Kansas City, St. Joseph, St. Louis, and Sedalia report 
for 1880-81 high schools with 4 years’ courses, most of them, if not all, giving a choice 
between English and classical studies, and enrolling for the year a total of 1,487 pupils. 
Kansas City extended its high school provisions by providing the beginnings of high 
school instruction for colored pupils, enrolling 35 in the first year of a 4 years’ course 
for these. St. Louis continued its arrangement for 1879-’80 of a central high school 
with 3 branch schools, which together enrolled 977 pupils.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Missouri, Columbia, founded in 1820 and organized in 1840, is open 
to students of either sex. The government of the institution is vested in aboard of cura- 
tors appointed by the governor. The departments of instruction are 10 academic schools 
(5 in science and 5 in languages) and 9 professional schools, that of mining and metal- 
lurgy being situated at Rolla. An attendance of 465 men and 93 women at Columbia 
and of 71 men and 25 women at Rolla’was reported for 1881, making a total of 654, the 
largest number ever enrolled in one year.— (Catalogue. ) 
Next in importance to the State University stands Washington University, St. Louis, 
with full courses and high standards, having the means of thorough preparation for males 
in its Smith Academy and for females in its Mary Institute, beyond which are excellent 
collegiate courses in arts, in philosophy, and in science. There is a useful three years’ 
course in mechanical industries, combining English studies with industrial drawing and 
shop work. Opportunity is also given for training in art in the St. Louis School of Fine 
Arts. The whole attendance in all these schools and departments was 1,367, the larger 
part,766, being inSmith Academy and the Mary Institute.— (Catalogue. 
Of the 15 other colleges nominally of this class, 2 (St. Joseph College, St. Joseph, and 
the College of the Christian Brothers, St. Louis) are believed, from the character of the 
official reports respecting them, to have been rather academic than collegiate instandard 
during the year under review. St. Vincent’s College, Cape Girardeau, indicates no stu- 
dents in collegiate classes; Lewis College, Glasgow, and Lincoln College, Greenwood, 
none but those in the freshman and sophomore years, thestudiesin which years at Lin- 
coln are hardly to be called collegiate, as given in the latest catalogue in hand. Of the 
remaining 10, some of which seem to have only a feeble life, returns and catalogues show 
preparatory departments with courses of 1 to 3 years, and collegiate with the usual 4 
years, except that Grand River College, Edinburg, had only 3 years, while 3 others 
(Christian University, Canton; Central College, Fayette; and William Jewell College, 
Liberty) had their studies arranged in schools instead of in classes. Christian Univer- 
sity and La Grange, Stewartsville, and Central Wesleyan Colleges had arrangements for 
normal training in addition to collegiate; and the same university, St. Louis University, 
and Stewartsville College offered commercial training, the course in this at St. Louis 
University covering 4 years. Music, drawing, and painting were taught in several col- 
leges, with what degree of thoroughness does notappear. Otherdepartments or arrange- 
ments will appear under Scientific and Professional Instruction. ‘ 
Four of the colleges report for 1880-81 gifts aggregating $116,000, Central College, 
Fayette, getting $25,000 from R. A. Barnes, of St. Louis, for endowment of a profess- 
orship, and $5,000 from other friends; Pritchett Institute, Glasgow, $1,000 for scholar- 
ships; Lincoln College, Greenwood, $2,500 for liquidation of debt and other purposes, 
and Drury College, Springfield, more than $83,000 for a chapel and for endowment of 
a Valeria G. Stone professorship, that lady giving $70,750 for these purposes.— (Cata- 
logues and returns. ) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The State University, Washington University, and Christian University admit women 
"as well as men, either as day pupils or with arrangements for separate residence, and so 
do Grand River, Lewis, Lincoln, La Grange, Drury, Stewartsville, and Central Wesleyan 
Colleges, with Pritchett School Institute, which is reckoned of collegiate rank. Besides 
these, 18 schools claiming to be for the higher education of young women are on the lists 
of this Bureau, at least 12 of them holding collegiate charters. Thirteen make report 
in-some way of their courses or statistics for 1880-81, showing generally arrangements 
for preparatory training even from primary instruction up, with collegiate or semi- 
collegiate courses of 3 to 5 years. Nearly all offer instruction in music, both vocal and 
instrumental, as well asin drawing and painting and the French and German languages, 
5 adding Latin and 2 Greek; 1, Anglo-Saxon, Italian, and Spanish. One of the 18 (St. 
Joseph Female College, St. Joseph) is reported by its president to have closed its work- 
June 2, 1881, with little prospect of a reopening.— (Circulars, catalogues, and returns. ) 
For the titles, location, and statistics of these latter-colleges (for women only), see

  148 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Missouri Agricultural and Mechanical College, at Columbia, offers a strictly profes- 
sional course of 2 years. The first year is devoted to horticulture and the pupil who 
completes it will be entitled to the certificate in horticulture ; the second year is agri- 
cultural. Students entering must pass an examination in mathematics through arith- 
metic, part of geometry and trigonometry, English grammar and geography, and before 
graduation must spend 2 months in college work. Those who complete the junior year 
of study receive a certificate in horticulture; those who complete the senior year, the 
degree of bachelor of agriculture. There were 5 students in the senior and 16 in the 
junior class in the autumn of 1881, under 11 instructors.— (Report of university. ) 
The Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy, at Rolla, has a preparatory department 
* and 3 courses of 3 years each, leading to the respective degrees of PH. B., C. E., and M. 
&. A 2 years’ teachers’ course, a 4 years’ course in arts for girls, and an optional course, 
including book-keeping, Latin, Greek, English, arid German, with drawing, ornamental 
and mechanical, are also offered. There were 96 students in 1880-’81, under 4 instruc- 
tors.— (Report of university, 1881-—’82. ) 
The O’ Fallon Polytechnic School of Washington University reports 5 courses of 4 years 
each, in civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry, mining and metallurgy, 
building and architecture. The studies are the same for all during the first 2 years, but 
diverge more or less in the junior and senior years, each course leading to its appropriate 
degree. There were 37 classified students, 8 in partial course, and 7 graduate students 
in attendance in 1881. This school gives free instruction in an evening school under the 
supervision and control of the school board of St. Louis, for the benefit of those engaged 
in or preparing for mechanical or industrial pursuits. 
The Manual Training School of Washington University, previously mentioned, is another 
means by which a practical foundation may be laid for the pursuit of mechanical in- 
dustries in a more scientific way than under the old system of apprenticeship. This 
school becomes each year a more interesting feature of the university. Its specified 
course in 1880-’81 was in mathematics, drawing, and the English branches of a high 
“school course, with instruction and practice in the use of tools. The tool instruction in- 
cluded carpentry, wood turning, pattern making, iron chipping and filing, forge work, 
brazing and soldering, the use of machine shop tools, &c. The course covers 3 years. 
(Catalogue of university and circulars of schools. ) 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Instruction in theology is given in some slight degree in Christian University (Chris- 
tian), and more fully at St. Vincent’s College (Roman Catholic), Central College 
(Methodist Episcopal: South), Lewis College (Methodist Episcopal), La Grange College 
(Baptist), Central. Wesleyan College (Methodist Episcopal), and ina course of biblical 
studies at Pritchett School Institute. Concordia College (Evangelical Lutheran), St. 
Louis, has a regular 3 years’ course in theology. The Jeremiah Vardeman School of 
‘Theology (Baptist), in William Jewell College, Liberty, reports a full 2 years’ course in 
the same for students who have taken one degree in college, or theological studies may 
be pursued in connection with the college literary course. There were 49 undergradu- 
ate and 3 graduate students in 1881.—( Catalogues and returns. ) 
Instruction in law is offered at the State U ‘sity, Columbia, and at the St. Louis 
‘Law School, a department of Washington University, St. Louis. Both present excel- 
lent courses of 2 years, the year in the former covering 7} months, in the latter 8. 
Both combine lecture and text book training, and the examinations at the close to de- 
termine the fitness of the candidates for graduation appear to be exceptionally close and 
thorough. Instructors at Columbia 8, at St. Louis also 8. For 188081 the former 
had 49 pupils in attendance and conferred the LL.B. degree on 28; the latter, an attend- 
ance of 70, on only 25 of whom the degree was conferred.— (Catalogues and returns. ) 
Instruction in medicine was given in 1880-’81 in the following 5 ‘‘regular’’ schools: 
medical department of the University of Missouri, Columbia; Kansas City College of 
Physicians and Surgeons (since then the Kansas City Medical College); St. Joseph 
Hospital Medical College, St. Joseph; Missouri Medical College, St. Louis, and the 
St. Louis Medical College. The first required a preliminary examination in English 
with an attendanee subsequently | on a 2 years’ graded course of 9 months each year; the 
last, a 3 years’ graded course of 5 months each year. The other 3 required the usual 3 
years of study under a preceptor and attendance on 2 lecture courses of 5 months, the 
Bt. Joseph College and the Missouri Medical offering also a3 years’ graded course. 
The State school at Columbia had 40 students and 5 graduates in 1880-’81; the Kansas 
City College, 42 students and 12 graduates; that at St. Joseph, 30 students and 7 
graduates; Missouri Medical College, St. Louis, 268 students and 119 graduates; St.     
   
-P-A-G-E-427
  MISSOURI. 149 
Louis Medical College, 151 students and 43 graduates. The small proportion of gradu- 
ates at the State school was doubtless a result of the high standard maintained and of 
the peculiarly thorough examination for degrees, which is by aselect medical board. A 
sixth school, entitled the medical department of the University of Kansas City, is 
reported to have been organized for the year 1881-’82,'but nothing further has been 
heard from it as this goes to press. 
The only recognized eclectic school was the American Medical College of St. Louis, 
which in 1881 required 3 years under a preceptor and attendance upon 2 lecture courses 
of 5 months each, or 2 years of reading and 3 courses of lectures, or 4 courses of lectures 
with intermediate reading. It reported 54 students and 22 graduated in 1880-81.“ 
The recognized homeopathic school in the same year was the St. Louis College of 
Homeopathic Physicians and Surgeons, open to both sexes and offering a 3 years’ 
gradgd course, but requiring only 3 years of study and attendance on 2 yearly lecture 
courses of 5 months each. No statistics are given except that there were 13 instructors; 
that 25 students of the class of 1879-’80 from“the Homeopathic Medical College of Mis- 
souri, out of which this grew, had been graduated; and that its own first class of 16 
graduated at the close of 1880-’81. 
Instruction in dentistry was continued at the Missouri Dental College,! St. Louis, 
which seems to have still retained its former 2 years’ graded course of about 5 months 
yearly, after a preliminary examination in English, though it had announced that it 
would, from 1879-’80, require a three years’ graded course; and also at the Western 
College of Dental Surgeons, St. Louis, with the same course. Like instruction was 
begun in the autumn of 1881 by a new school, the Kansas City Dental College, which 
requiréd a certain amount of preparation, but exacted no examination for admission; 
the course here covered 3 years of 40 weeks each. 
Instruction in pharmacy went on, as before, at the St. Louis School of Pharmacy, 
with the requirement of the customary 4 years of+experience in apothecary work and 
attendance on 2 annual lecture courses in pharmacy of 5 months each. Its graduating 
class of 1880-’81 numbered 27 out of a class of 36 that had been trained under 13 in- 
structors. Its junior class numbered 51. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB, 
The Missouri Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Fulton (founded in 
1851), reported 12 instructors and 147 male and 96 female students for 1881. _ Articula- 
tion, the common English branches, printing, shoemaking, dress making, and cabinet 
making are taught. Gardening is also practised. Pupils are admitted between the 
ages of 9 and 21; while 8 years of instruction are allowed, the average time spent in the 
institution is only 4} years.— (Return, 1881.) 
The St. Louis Day School for Deaf-Mutes, founded in 1878, under the control of the 
board of directors of the public schools, had 48 pupils under instruction in 1880-81, with 
an average attendance of 31 out of 35 in average belonging. These were divided among 
5 classes, all in English studies.— (Return and city report. ) 
~ EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Missouri School for the Blind, St. Louis, founded in 1850, had 90 pupils in 
1881, who were receiving instruction in a musical and literary course. To the boys, 
broom and brush making, cane seating, and mattress making; to the girls, sewing, knit- 
ting, and bead and fancy work were taught.— (Return, 1881.) 
TRAINING OF NURS 
    The Missouri School of Midwifery, St. Louis, organized and incorporated in 1875, 
in 1880 had received 180 pupils and graduated 143. No report has been received for 
1881. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Manual Training School of Washington University, St. Louis, began in September, 
1880, with a3 years’ course of instruction, the time of the pupils being about equally 
divided between mental and manual exercises. A single class of 58 members was ad- 
mitted the first year, and a second was received in September, 1881, making an attend- 
ance of 101, as reported December, 1881. The mental instruction included a thorough 
course in English and mathematics through plane trigonometry; the manual training, a 
course in free hand, mechanical, and technical drawing, with the theory and use of hand 
and machine tools, study and management of the steam engine, &c. Before receiving a 
1Phis school reports for 188081 a faculty of 10, with 13 students and 1 graduate; the next men- tioned, the Western College of Dental Surgeons, 7 instructors, 6 students, and no graduates.

diploma, each student must complete the actual construction of a machine, which, with 
the drawings and patterns used, remains in the school.— (Catalogue. ) 
The Girls’ Industrial Home and School, St. Louis, had an average of 60 under training 
for 1881. The common English branches, dress making, and plain sewing were taught. 
(Return, 1881.) Y / 
The Blind Girls’ Industrial Home has not reported for 1881. 
HOMES FOR ORPHAN OR DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
Reports have been received from 5 institutions of this class foy 1881. Of 3 Roman 
Catholic homes reporting from St. Louis, St. Joseph’s Asylum for Boys had 250 inmates; 
St. Mary’s Asylum for Girls, 101; and St. Bridget’s Half-Orphan Asylum for Girls, 107. 
St. Joseph’s Asylum for Girls, Kansas City, had 38. The Protestant Orphan Asylum, 
Webster Groves, founded in 1835, had 64 boys and 25 girls. In all, such education as 
is practicable is given in elementary English studies and in industries.—(Repért and 
returns, 1881.) * 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATIONS. 
The Missouri State Teachers’ Association held its meeting for 1881 at Sweet Springs 
the last week in June. It is said to have been one of the most successful meetings ever 
held in the State, Prof. F. Louis Soldan, the president, having awakened an interest in 
it in all parts of the State. The exercises were short, interesting, and profitable. No 
other information respecting its proceedings has been received.— (American Journal of 
Education, April, 1881, and Journal of Education, September 1, 1881.) 
The Southwest Missouri Teachers’ Association met at Lebanon December 28-30, 1881. 
The programme is reported to have been excellent, but particulars are wanting.— (New 
York School Journal. ) 
The Missouri Valley State Teachers’ Association met at Warrensburg December 28-29, 
1881. ‘‘Duties of the teacher,”’ ‘‘Libraries for the public schools,’’ ‘‘ Primary teach- 
ing,’’ were among the topics discussed.— (Journal of Education.) 
The Southeast Missouri Teachers’ Association met at Salem, Dent County, apparently in 
August, with Prof. R. C. Norton, of Cape Girardeau, as president. The attendance was 
good and the teachers apparently were deeply interested, discussing earnestly and intel- 
ligently the various subjects brought before them; but, asin the case of the other associ- 
ations, details are not given.— (Journal of Education.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The charge of educational interests for the State in general is committed to a State su- : 
perintendent of public instruction, elected by thé people biennially; a board of 6 regents
-P-A-G-E-430
  152 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
of the State University, elected for 6 years, with annual change of 2; a normal school 
board of 7, 5 appointed by the governor for 5 years, with 2 ex officio members; and a 
board of school lands, composed of the chief officers of the State. 
The local officers are county superintendents of public schools, elected for 2 years; a 
board of 3 trustees for ordinary districts, and one of 6 for districts containing 150 or more 
children of legal school age, the members of both boards elected for 3 years, with annual 
change of one-third. : 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The system of education provided by the State comprises district, graded, and high 
schools, a normal school, normal institutes, a State university, a reform school, an insti- 
tution for the blind, and one for the deaf and dumb. The public schools are free to all 
persons of legal school age resident in the district, and are sustained from the interest of 
@ permanent school fund; from lease and sale of school lands, and interest on unpaid 
principal of school lands sold; from a State tax not to exceed 1} mills on the aoa as- 
sessment of the State—all these to be applied exclusively to the payment of teachers’ 
wages; from a local tax, which in cities may not exceed 10 mills on the dollar and in other 
districts 25 mills; also, from certain fines, forfeitures, and licenses. The State tax and 
income from school fund and lands are divided equally among the counties in proportion to 
thenumber of children of schoolage. Each county superintendent adds to the amount thus 
apportioned to him the proceeds of fines imposed and licenses granted in the county, and 
divides one-fourth equally among the districts and three-fourths pro rata according to the 
children of school age. Every voter and every woman owning personal or real property 
assessed in the district or having children of school age (provided she is over 21 years old 
and has resided in the district 40 days) is entitled to vote at district meetings. Qualified 
teachers must hold certificates from the examining officers or from an approved normal 
school. They must make monthly reports to the proper officers, and no teacher is to 
receive payment in full for a term until the term summary is properly filled out and 
approved by the director. Provision is made for graded or high schools. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Of 10,476 additional youth for instruction, 8,227, avery large proportion, were enrolled 
in public schools, and probably a fair proportion of the remainder in private or church 
schools. Of the 8,227 more enrolled in the State schools, the superintendent reports 5,348 
as in average daily attendance, which again is a good proportion in a region where at- 
tendance in winter is often difficult on account of the snow. To meet this large addi- 
tional enrolment and attendance we find 337 more school-houses and 459 more teachers, 
the average pay of teachers being slightly increased. Public school income advanced 
$198,655, though only $27,108 of this were actually expended. The growth of the State 
school fund by $1,803,348 within the year is another indication of good condition, this 
being believed to be the highest increase in a year under ordinary circumstances in any 
State. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For information concerning any Kindergarten in the State, see Table V of the appendix; 
for a summary of their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
The law provides that incorporated cities having 2,000 or more inhabitants shall con- 
stitute a school district and shall have a board of education of not less than 6 members 
elected for 2 years; this board shall elect a city superintendent of public education, who 
shall act as principal. Omaha had a city board of 12 members, one-half changed an- 
nually, in 1880.— (School taw, 1881.)

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Lincoln classes her schools as primary, grammar, and high, and for 1881 reported 12 
school buildings, containing 31 rooms, with 1,750 sittings, valued, with sites and furni- 
ture, at $69,000. The schools were taught 176 days by 3 men and 27 women. An 
estimated enrolment of 100 in private schools is given.— (Return, 1881.) 
Omaha in 1881 had 11 school buildings, an increase of one during the year, with 65 
school and recitation rooms ; the estimated value, with sites and furniture, was $366,000. 
The schools were taught 196 days, and 56 women and 3 men were employed as teachers. 
For private and parochial schools there were reported 12 school rooms and an estimated 
enrolment of 500.— (Return, 1881.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL INSTRUCTION PROVIDED BY THE STATE. 
The Nebraska State Normal School, Peru, reported for 1881 an elementary course of 2 
years and a higher course of 3 years. The catalogue shows an attendance of 157 young 
women and 117 young men, with 6 graduates from the higher-and 34 from the elementary © 
course, all of whom have engaged in teaching.— (Catalogue and return, 1881.) 
The State University, Lincoln, made arrangements in 1881 for instruction in didactics, at 
first as a special department, subsequently as an optional 3 hours’ study in the junior 
and senior years. Hon.S.R. Thompson, formerly State superintendent, is in charge of 
the instruction.— (Catalogue. ) 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Santee Normat Training School, Santee Agency, established by the American Board of 
Commissioners for Foreign Missions for the purpose of providing preachers, teachers, 
interpreters, business men, and model women for the Dakota Nation, reported 34 stu- 
dents as receiving normal instruction and 109 in attendance during the year 1881. The 
Indian vernacular was used in teaching, and the plan of sending the advanced pupils to 
eastern schools to acquaint them with English and to teach them more of American 
civilization has been adopted.— (Return and catalogue, 1881.) 
St. Paul’s Boarding School, Yankton Reserve, organized in 1873 (under the care of the 
Protestant Episcopal Church, Rt. Rev. William H. Hare, Bishop of Niobrara, president) 
and meant to prepare for both ministerial and teaching work, reported a successful year, 
with 6 teachers and an average of 39 pupils in attendance. The instruction includes 
industrial as well as literary training, farming and gardening entering into it, and the 
use of tools. The industrial teaching was to be extended in the session of 1881—’82.— 
(Spirit of Missions, November and December, 1881.) 
The Central Normal School, Genoa, and Lancaster County Normal Institute, Lincoln, have 
sent no report for 1881. 
A normal course of 4 years is given in Doane College, Crete, with 21 students in 1880-’81; 
2 years’ normal courses in Nebraska Conference Seminary, York, and in Nebraska Wes- 
leyan University, Fullerton, the former with 11 normal students in the fall of 1881, the 
latter with 23in 1880~’81. Normal lectures and instruction are offered at Gates College, 
Neligh, and at Pawnee City Academy, but without specific courses or note of students 
under normal training.— (Catalogues, 1881.) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The school law provides that two kinds of teachers’ institutes shall be held in the 
State, viz: normal institutes, to be organized by the State superintendent, and county 
institutes, to be organized by county superintendents. Institutes, nearly all organized 
by county superintendents, were held in 41 counties in 1881; they enrolled 1,856 teachers 
and 1,809 teachers were in average attendance. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL, 
Literary and Educational Notes, published semimonthly at Fairmont, is devoted to 
education in Nebraska, and is the official medium for all publications from the State 
department of public instruction. It was in its eighth volume in 1881. Its present

PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The law provides that any district containing more than 150 children may elect a board 
of 6 trustees, who shall have power to classify and grade scholars and to establish a high 
school in such district. For 1881 the State superintendent reported 27 high schools, 
with 1,458 pupils.

OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory schools, and 
preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VU, and IX of the appendix; 
for summaries of their statistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The board of regents of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln (non-sectarian), is author- 
ized by law to establish 5 colleges or departments; but only the college of literature, 
science, and the arts, with an industrial college, had been organized up to 1880-81. 
Tuition in these is free to all students, without regard to sex, race, or place of residence. 
The college of liberal arts offers classical, scientific, and literary courses of 4 years, with 
2 years preparatory for each. A department of didactics was established January, 1881, 
and a professor for it assigned, but subsequently the studies of that department were 
made electives in the regular junior and senior years. _ A conservatory of music has been 
established in connection with the university, its studies optional, with moderate charges 
for instruction. Students in literary and scientific department, including preparatory, 
258 in the fall of 1881.— (Catalogue. ) 
The other colleges reporting are Doane College, Crete (Congregational), with an attend- 
ance in all departments of 121; Nebraska Wesleyan University, Fullerton (Methodist 
Episcopal), with 72; Nebraska College, Nebraska City (Protestant Episcopal), with 67; 
and Creighton College, Omaha (Roman Catholic), with 200. All have preparatory de- 
partments, with different lengths of course, and classical collegiate and scientific courses, 
except Creighton, which has a 6 years’ classical course, the really collegiate studies in 
which begin in the fourth year. Doane offers in addition a 5 years’ literary and 4 years’ 
normal; Nebraska Wesleyan, a 3 years’ English scientific, 3 years’ academic, 2 years’ 
normal, 2 years’ musical, 1 year’s commercial, and a non-resident course; Creighton, a 
commercial of 4 years.— (Catalogues and returns, 1881.) 
For full statistics of these colleges, see Table IX of the appendix, and asummary of 
the same in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Doane College, the State University, and the Nebraska Wesleyan offer the same ad- 
vantages to women astomen. Brownell Hall, Omaha, is the only institution exclusively 
for women that may fairly be said to offer superior instruction. An attendance of 76 
was reported for 1881. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. ‘ 
The University of Nebraska, in its industrial college, reported courses of 4 years in 
civil engineering, agriculture, and horticulture, with two years preparatory foreach. The 
young men are trained in military science and tactics. 
Doane College reported a scientific course of 4 years. 
For statistics, see Tables IX and X of the appendix. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
  For theological instruction the German Congregational Theological Seminary, Crete, 
had a 2 years’ preparatory and 4 years’ academic department with a 3 years’ theological 
course in 1881. The Nebraska Divinity School, Nebraska City (Protestant Episcopal), 
established in 1866 and still open for instruction, had at last report a 4 years’ academic 
and 3 years’ theological course, with apparently § students within the year 1880-’81. 
No school of law was reported. 
The Nebraska School of Medicine, offering simply preparatory instruction, began its first 
session of 20 weeks at Omaha in October, 1880, with a class of 14 students, men and 
women. The success of this school led its founders to incorporate it as aregular medical 
college. A building being erected, arrangements were made for clinical instruction at 
the St. Joseph’s Hospital, and the Omaha Medical College, with a required course of 3 
years of study and attendance on 2 full courses of lectures of about 43 months each and 
an optional graded course of 3 years, announced its opening for October, 1881.—(An- 
nouncements. ) 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Nebraska Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, Omaha, founded in 1869, reported 7 
instructors and 97 pupils for 1881. All common school branches are taught, also paint-
-P-A-G-E-433

ing and drawing. Boys are instructed in printing and carpentry; girls, in needle and 
fancy work and general housework. Articulation is taught by means of Bell’s visible 
speech symbols.— (Return, 1881.) 
INSTRUCTION OF THE BLIND. 
The Nebraska Institute for the Blind, Nebraska City, opened in 1875, reported in 1880 
a principal, 3 teachers, 28 pupils enrolled, and 22 in average attendance; instruction was 
given in the branches usually taught in the best graded schools, in vocal and instrumental 
musi¢, and in some of the industrial arts. The number of officers remained the same in 
1881 and the average attendance increased. 
  STATE REFORM SCHOOL. 
A bill passed the legislature in 1880 to establish a State Reform School at Kearney, 
appropriating $10,000 for buildings and to support the school for 2 years. The citizens 
of Kearney donated a farm of 320 acres upon which the building was erected. No re- 
port as to the opening and progress of the school has been received.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS, 
For the State, a superintendent of public instruction chosen by the people®quadrien- 
nially, a State board of education, and a board of regents of the State university; for each 
county, a superintendent of public schools and a county board of examiners; for each 
district, a board of trustees of three or five members, according to population.— (Laws, 
1881.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The State schools are free to all youth of school age (6-18); the law provides for grad- 
ing them into Kindergarten, primary, grammar, and high in all districts where such 
division into departments seems advisable. It also requires attendance for four months 
each year of all sound children between the ages of 8 and 14 not taught elsewhere. 
‘The sources of support for the schools are the income from the State school fund and a 
State tax of half a mill on the dollar, used only for the payment of teachers; an annual 
county tax of 15 to 50 cents on the $100, which may be used at the discretion of local 
officers for purchasing sites and buildings, for hiring school-houses, for establishing school 
libraries, or for necessary contingent expenses; and a district tax where necessary to con- 
tinue the school term to six months in districts in which the State and county funds are 
insufficient for that purpose. Special taxes also for erecting buildings, extending the 
school term, &c., may be levied on an affirmative vote of the people of the district. Rate 
bills for tuition may be levied by the trustees for the purpose of prolonging schools that 
have been maintained six months in the year by public funds and have been free to all. 
The State and county school funds are apportioned as follows: Twenty-five per cent. 
among the districts proportionately to the number of teachers assigned to each, on the 
basis of one hundred census children or fraction thereof to a teacher, and the remainder 
equally in proportion to the number of children of school age. In order to obtain State 
aid, the schools must be non-sectarian, must be taught at least three months by teachers 
duly examined and certified, and must use the text’ books ordered by the State board of 
education. To receive their pay, teachers must have been legally employed by the board 
of trustees, must have had a certificate from the county board of examination, and must 
have made full reports as required by law. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The reports of the school system are issued only once in two years. That for 1881 not 
having appeared until this report was going to press, any extended consideration of the 
general educational condition of the State must be postponed. 
‘ KINDERGARTEN. 
The law provides for Kindergirten in connection with the public schools. The Kinder- 
garten department at Carson City, established April, 1880, reported 2 teachers and 50 
scholars for 1881, and is the only one reporting up to date.— (Return, 1881.) 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF VIRGINIA CITY. 
OFFICERS. 
Each village, town, or incorporated city forms one school district, the schools of which 
are under the control of a board of trustees. In cities with 1,500 or more registered 
voters there must be 5 trustees; in smaller towns, 3. 
STATISTICS. 
Virginia City, with a population of 10,917 in 1880, had 2,559 children of legal school 
age, an enrolment of 2,260 of school age in public schools, and (together with 195 below 
school age) an average attendance of 1,276. The schools were taught 202 days by 32 
teachers in 5 buildings containing 31 school rooms and 1,545 sittings for study. School 
property was valued at $71,500. An estimated enrolment of 447 was given in private 
schools. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
In the absence-of normal schools, either private or public teachers’ institutes seem to 
be the only means provided for the training of teachers, and the holding of these is dis- 
cretionary with the State and county superintendents. The law authorizes the State 
superintendent to convene annually, with the consent of the board of education, a State 
institute for a session of 5 to 10 days and to engage such instructors as he may consider
-P-A-G-E-436
  158 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
advisable, the cost of the institute not to exceed $100. County superintendents, with 
the consent of the board of commissioners, may call one or more institutes annually, the 
cost of the same not to exceed $100. 
Information respecting institutes held in 1881 is wanting. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
STATE UNIVERSITY. 
The State University, Elko, organized in 1874, at the last advices, had established only 
a preparatory department. It reported buildings and grounds in 1880 valued at $25,000, 
an appropriation from the State of $6,000 for the year, and 48 students enrolled, of which 
number 26 were girls. 
INSTITUTION FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Bishop Whitaker’s School for Girls, established at Reno in 1876, reported for 1881, 
through the Protestant Episcopal Almanac, 6 teachers and 56 students. There is a pre- 
paratory department and a well arranged 4 years’ English course, with Latin and modern 
languages optional. Music, drawing, : and painting are also taught.— (Catalogue, 1879; 
Almanac, 1882.) 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
STATE UNIVERSITY, ELKO. 
As far as can be ascertained without the authoritative information of a State report, 
no institutions for instruction in theoretical or practical science, in theology, law, or 
medicine, have yet been opened in the State, except as the first mentioned may be in- 
cluded in the courses of the university at Elko. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF, THE BLIND, THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
Provision is made by the State for the instruction of its deaf-mute and blind youth 
at the school in Berkeley, Cal. Whether there is any like provision for the feeble- 
minded, or for youth that need reformatory training, does not appear. 
TRAINING OF ORPHANS. 
The State Orphans’ Home, in a biennial report for 1879 and 1880, received too late for 
use in the report of the Commissioner for the latter year, reports an enrolment of 30 girls 
and 46 boys, an average of 54 belonging and of 46 in daily attendance in the school con- 
nected with it. . Instruction is given in the common English branches and vocal music. 
There have been 174 children in the institution since 1870, while 57, with ages ranging 
rom 2 to 14, remained in the home January 1, 1881.— (Report, 1879 and 1880.)

governor, the State superintendent, and 5 persons’ appointed by the governor with con- 
sent of the council for 2 years. 
For towns, school committees are elected by ballot or appointed by the selectmen, of 
such number, for such term, and with such powers as the electors may determine. One 
of their number may be chosen by the board to superintend and visit schools, or any town 
or city may elect or appoint a superintendent of schools. 
For districts, there are a moderator, a clerk, and a prudential committee of from 1 to 
3 persons. School districts comprising the whole town must, and certain others may, 
elect a board of education of 3, 6, or 9 members, who have the powers of school and 
prudential committees. 
Women may vote in school meetings and are eligible to all school offices.— (Laws, 
1878, 1879, 1881.) OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all resident children of school age. The law is compul- 
sory in regard to the attendance of all 6 to 16 not attending other schools or otherwise 
employed. The employment of children under ten years of age and of any child under 
16 unable to read and write is forbidden, except in vacation. No child under 16 may be 
employed unless he has attended school 12 weeks during the preceding year; none under 
14, unless he has attended 6 months or the full term of school taught in his district; and 
none under 12 who has not attended during the entire term. Employers must have a 
certificate from the school committee as to such attendance before giving employment. 
Persons having control of children between 8 and 14 are required to have them instructed 
for at least twelve weeks annually in a public or private school or at home. For viola- 
tion of this law parents or guardians may be fined $10 for the first and $20 for each sub- 
sequent offence; employers, not to exceed $20 for each offence. School committees and 
‘boards of education are authorized to elect truant officers, whose duty it shall be to 
enforce the laws and ordinances in regard to truants and children not attending school 
between the ages of 6 and 16, and in regard to children employed in manufacturing 
establishments without attending school as required. Persons proposing to teach, who 
give satisfactory evidence of good moral character and of suitable temper and disposition 
for teaching, must be examined by the school committee of the town in such branches 
as are taught in the schools, and, if found competent, receive certificates, which must be 
delivered to the prudential committee before they can be employed. No teacher may 
receive payment for services who has not delivered to the prudential committee a certifi- 
cate that a register or record has been properly kept and returned at the end of the term. 
‘The public schools are sustained from the proceeds of a State literary fund and of a fund 
created by the sale of State lands; there is also a town tax on polls and ratable estate 
of $350 for school purposes for every dollar in the $1,000 of State tax which such towns 
are required to raise for general purposes, but towns may raise a larger amount. The 
apportionment of the State fund is made according to the number of scholars 5 years 
old and upwards who have attended the public schools not less than 2 weeks; the town 
tax is distributed with reference to the valuation of the district for the year or in any 
manner desired by the voters of the town.— (Laws, 1878, 1879, 1881.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics for 1881 show a decrease in enrolment, in average attendance, in length 
of term, in number of school-houses, in estimated value of school property, in pay of 
teachers, and in number of teachers from normal schools, and an increase in youth of 
school age out of school. There was increase in the number of school districts, of public 
schools, of graded and high schools, of schools having maps and globes, in number of 
teachers, and of those teaching the same school for successive terms. The State super- 
intendent reported 785 schools with 12 scholars or less and 297 with only 6, most of 
them in the rural districts. He urges the uniting of districts as provided for by law. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. , 
The public schools of towns and cities are under the control of school committees or 
boards of education. A superintendent may be elected or appointed, as the people de- 
cide. In Concord there is a board of education of 9 members, one of their number 
being chosen as superintendent of schools. Manchester has a committee comprising 
the mayor, the president of the common council, and one member from each ward. 
Dover, Nashua, and Portsmouth have each committees of 12 members. All except 
Portsmouth have superintendents.

The public schools of Nashua are graded as primary, grammar, and high, and in 1881 
occupied 17 buildings, with 52 rooms, valued, with sites, &c., at $236,891. An enrol- 
ment of 2,606 was given for both day and evening schools, with an av erage attendance 
of 1,951 in day schools only. There were 3 men and 49 women engaged in teaching.

eel had 1 high, 9 grammar, and 3 primary school buildings, containing 35 
rooms and valued, with sites, &c., at $82,600. The schools were open for instruction 200 
days, with 34 teachers and an average attendance of 1,771. The high school offered in 
1880-81 a 3 years’ English and a 4 years’ Latin course. Of the successful candidates 
for admission in 1881, 26 elected to take the 4 years’ and 20 the 3 years’ course. An 
estimated enrolment of 150 was reported in private schools.— (Return and city report.)   
    
              TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, PLYMOUTH. 
The State Normal School was organized in 1871 as a strictly professional school for the 
training of teachers. The State appropriated for its support in 1881 $8,500 and the city 
of Plymouth $1,350. The full course comprises 2 years, but students preparing to teach 
in the primary schools, upon passing the requisite examination, may take a single year’s 
course, one term devoted to the study of methods, the second to practice in the training 
school. There are 100 children in attendance on the training school, graded to correspond 
with the 5 lower grades of the city schools; each pupil teacher has a class of ten for ten 
weeks and then a similar class of another grade for the same length of time. Critic 
teachers give daily direction to the work which is subject to inspection. There were 35 
students enrolled in 1881, only 2 of them young men.— (Return and catalogue. )     
      
TEACHERS’ INSTITU 
  The law makes no provision for institutes; but teachers, realizing the advantages to be 
derived from the exercises and association of institutes, have held them at their own ex- 
pense in various parts of the State.— (Statement of State superintendent. )

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Any town or district may, by so voting, become a high school district and establish 
a high school. There were 60 such schools reported for 1881, an increase of 13 for the 
year. In the 31 which furnished statistics there were 31 men and 56 women teaching; 
1,155 boys and 1,441 girls in attendance; 920 studying ancient and 384 modern lan- 
guages. 
PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The statistics from 40 of the 50 private schools of higher grade reporting to the State 
superintendent for 1881 show 78 men and 61 women teaching; 1,729 boys and 1,147 girls 
in attendance; 866 studying ancient and 469 modern languages. Twenty of theseschools 
report libraries with more than 300 volumes, the largest containing 4,000. 
For statistics of such schools reporting to this Bureau, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of 
the appendix, and for summaries of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGE FOR YOUNG MEN. 
Dartmouth College, Hanover, continued to be in 1881 the sole institution for superior 
instruction in this State, and had not yet opened its doors to women in any of the col- 
legiate departments, which are academic, medical, agricultural, and scientific. Forthe 
last three see Scientific and Professional Instruction, further on. .The collegiate standard 
is high, the preparatory examination covering as much as the full course of some schools 
claiming to be colleges. Graduates from approved preparatory schools having courses of 
at least 3 years are admitted without examination on the certificates of their principals 
that they have mastered the entire requisites for admission or their equivalents. The 
academic department has a four years’ classical course, with modern languages, mathe- 
matics, history, &c. Part of the studies in this for the junior and senior years are to be 
elective after 1881-82. The same department has also a Latin-scientific course, which 
omits Greek and substitutes for it an equivalent amount of mathematical, scientific, and 
modern language studies. The preparatory examination for this is the same as for the 
classical, except as respects Greek history and language. After 1882 this preparatory 
examination will include French.— (Catalogue. ) 
For statistics of this department, see Table IX of the appendix. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For statistics of the 4 institutions that usually report themselves under this head, see 
Table VIII of the appendix; for summaries of their statistics, a corresponding table in 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Hanover, was estab- 
lished on the basis of the congressional land grant and in connection with Dartmouth 
College in 1866. It offers students the English portion of a collegiate course, with such 
other studies as may prepare them to become intelligent and scientific farmers. An at- 
tendance of 41 was reported for 1881 and 14 received the degree of B. s. 
The Chandler Scientific Department of Dartmouth College had 48 students pursuing its 4 
years’ course, and conferred the degree of B. s. on 12 in 1881. The course includes in- 
struction in the practically useful arts of life. No other preparatory studies are re- 
quired than those taught in the common schools of New England. 
The Thayer School of Civil Engineering, also a department of Dartmouth, provides an 
exclusively professional training in its2 years’ course, which is really a graduate course. 
A rigid examination in common and higher branches is required for admission, There 
were 7 students in 1881 and one degree of civil engineer was conferred. 
For further information as to these departments, see Table X of appendix.

PROFESSIONAL. 
There were no schools of theology or law reporting from this State in 1881. 
Medical instruction was given in the medical department of Dartmouth College under 
8 professors and 5 lecturers. Applicants for.admission, unless matriculates of some regu- 
lar medical college or graduates of some reputable college, academy, or high school, must 
pass an examination upon entering. For graduation, 2 full courses of lectures of 16 
weeks each and 3 years of professional study are required.1 There were 96 students in 
1881; the degree of M. D. was conferred upon 29, some of whom had graduated in No- 
vember, 1880. 
For any further particulars, see Table XIII of appendix. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
New Hampshire has no institution for the education of the deaf and dumb and the 
blind, but makes provision for their instruction in the Perkins Institution and Massachu- 
setts School for the Blind, Boston; in the Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Hartford, Conn. ; 
and in the Clarke Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Northampton, Mass. Statistics of those 
thus trained are wanting. 
. REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The State Industrial School, Manchester, established in 1858, has had during the 23 years 
of its existence 1,087 inmates, and reported 100 boys and 15 girls in the institution in 1881. 
They are all taught the common English branches; out of school the boys are engaged in 
farming, gardening, chair seating, and shoemaking; the girls, in sewing and general 
housework. About three-fourths of those discharged are known to have become useful 
and orderly members of society.— (Return, 1881.) 
TRAINING OF ORPHAN AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
The Orphans’ Home, Concord, under Protestant Episcopal influence, admits children 
between the ages of 1 and 10, and requires boys to leaveat 12 and girlsat18. There were 
9 boysand 17 girls reported for 1881.— (Return, 1881.) 
The New Hampshire Orphans’ Home, Franklin, a private and non-sectarian institution 
supported by voluntary contribution, receives children from 3 to 14 and reported 31 in- 
mates in 1881. All are taught common school branches; the boys are employed in farm- 
ing and printing; the girls, in sewing and housework.— (Return, 1881.) 
The Children’s Home, Portsmouth, receives orphan, motherless, or otherwise homeless 
children under 12 years of age, and trains them, without distinction of creed or color, in 
practical home duties and in habits of honesty, truthfulness, purity, and industry, with 
literary instruction in the public schools. Number admitted to February, 1881, 21; re- 
turned to parents, 3; died, 1; remaining, 17. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
PROF. DAVID CROSBY. 
Born in 1807 at Hebron, N. H., he died at his home in Nashua February 25, 1881. 
Having chosen teaching for his profession and by perseverance and industry having gained 
the means to complete his studies, he entered Dartmouth College and graduated in 1833. 
He settled in Nashua in 1836 and opened a high school; a few years later he founded and 
had incorporated the Nashua Literary Institution, of which he was the principal until 
failing health led him to give up his school 2 years before his death; he continued, how- 
ever, to teach a private class at his home to within five or six weeks of his death. In the 
fifty-six years he was a teacher, he instructed many men who have become famous in the 
State and nation. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-eighth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Portsmouth, December 21-23, 1881. Among those present were Hon. J. W. Patterson, 
State superintendent; Prof. Warren and Miss Reed, of the State Normal School; Professors 
Quimby and Ruggles, of Dartmouth; Prof. Elliott Whipple, of the McGaw Normal In- 
stitute; Principals Bacheler and Clifford, of'Manchester; Principals Jones and Webster, 
of Boston. The leading subject for papers and discussion was mathematics, although 
  
1Besides the required lectures there is offered instruction by daily recitations from the middle of 
December to the third week in June. '

OFFICERS. 
There is a State board of education, which consists of the trustees of the school fund 
and the trustees and treasurer of the State Normal School. A superintendent of public

166 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
instruction, holding his office at the pleasure of the board and generally chosen for 3 
years, is ex officio secretary of the same, president of the State Association of School 
Superintendents, and an associate member with the principal of the State Normal School 
in forming a State board of examiners; he is also an ex officio member of all county and 
city boards of examiners. % 
For each county, a superintendent is appointed by the State board of education, sub- 
ject to the approval of the county board of freeholders, holding office at the pleasure of 
the board. A county board of examiners is composed of the county superintendent and 
not more than 3 teachers appointed by him for one year. 
For each school district there is a board of 3 trustees, all elected by the legal voters of 
the district at their first annual meeting, and afterwards 1 each year, for 3years’ service. 
The district trustees of each township together constitute a township board, who meet 
the county superintendent semiannually at such times as he may designate, to receive 
communications and suggestions and to submit questions for his advice and opinion in 
regard to the management of the schools. Women are eligible to the office of school 
trustee.— (School laws. ) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all residents 5 to 18, without regard to religion, nation- 
ality, or color, and are supported from the proceeds of a State fund and from a State tax 
equal to $4 for each child of school age, which tax is apportioned for assessment among the 
several counties in proportion to the amount of taxable property in said counties. Of 
the moneys annually raised from State tax, 10 per cent., known as the reserve fund, is 
apportioned by the board of education at its discretion, and 90 per cent. of the amount 
raised in any county is paid back to said county. If the sums received from the State 
are not suflicient to maintain schools 9 months in each year, townships may raise an 
additional amount, and must add, from the interest of the surplus revenue received 
by them and from other funds not raised by tax, such sums as the town meeting may 
direct. County superintendents must apportion the State moneys and all other sums 
received for school purposes according to the number of school children; provided that no 
district shall receive from all State and county funds less than $200 and districts with 
45 or more children not less than $350. To get this aid, districts must provide suitable 
school buildings and must have maintained a free schaol for 9 months during the pre- 
ceding year. Not more than $20 of the school moneys so received may be used for any 
other purpose than teachers’ salaries and fuel. Cities and districts may raise such other 
sums as they need for buildings, repairs, and general school purposes. 
To receive their pay, teachers must hold certificates of qualification and present a duly 
kept register for the time for which pay is asked; they are required to attend the annual 
institute held in the county in which they teach, unless excused by the superintendent, 
their pay continuing during such attendance; they may suspend disorderly scholars, 
reporting their action to the school trustees for approval, but are not allowed to inflict 
corporal punishment. 
An annual appropriation of $100 for each teachers’ institute held in any county or in 
two or more adjoining counties is made by the State. : 
The State encourages the establishment of schools for training in mechanical and in- 
dustrial pursuits by offering to any city, town, or township that will raise $3,000 a like 
‘sum for the establishment of such school and an annual contribution, not to exceed 
$5,000, for its support, if the city or township will do the same; it also encourages the 
formation of district libraries by giving $20, if the same amount is raised by the district, 
and a further sum of $10 yearly, if the district shall have given the same. 
CHANGES IN THE SCHOOL LAWS. 
Two important additions to the school laws and two important changes were made in 
1881 and are incorporated in the above review of the features of the State school system. 
One of the additions was the rule as to the admission of pupils to the State schools 
without regard to religion, nationality, or color. The occasion for its introduction was 
an effort on the part of a school board in a certain district to exclude one of these 
classes, whereupon the legislature promptly enacted a law against any such class dis- 
tinctions in the schools. The other addition was the provision as to the encouragement 
of industrial training already mentioned. 
The changes were (1) as to the basis for the annual State tax for schools, which had 
been 2 mills on $1 of all property and was made to be $4 for every child of school age; 
(2)as to the apportionment of the school moneys to the counties, which had been accord- 
ing to the number of school children, and was made 90 per cent. to each county of the 
amount that it had raised, the remaining 10 per cent. at the discretion of the State 
board of education to such points as might seem most to need or to deserve it. The 
apportionment within each county will still be according to the number of children of 
school age.

GENERAL @ONDITION. 
For the first time in many years there appear evidences of some decline in the school 
life of the State. With 4,946 more children to be educated, there were 1,419 fewer 
brought into the public schools than in 1879-80, while 5,622 fewer were in average 
monthly enrolment and 5,142 fewer in average daily attendance. There was a reduction 
of $4.75 in the average monthly pay of men, with a falling off of 65 in their number, the 
places vacated, however, being filled by women. ‘The report shows that there were many 
more high grade certificates issued, with fewer of the lower grade. There were 70 more 
departments of public schools established, which at the rate of 50 seats to a department 
would accommodate nearly two-thirds of the increased number of school age. Of the 
reduction of about 2 per cent. in average attendance based on enrolment the State super- 
intendent offers no explanation. 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
‘There was an increasein the number of schools held in the evening for persons employed 
during the day as well as in the attendance on such schools. New Brunswick abolished 
its evening schools, and Elizabeth, Gloucester City, and Morristown established such 
schools; in Hoboken, Millville, Newark, Paterson, and Salem they were continued. There 
were thus 8 cities with these schools, instead of 6, having 91 more evenings of school, with 
an increase of 1,576 in enrolment of pupils, of 576 in average attendance, of 18 in teach- 
ers employed, and of $1,903 expended for instruction. The percentage of average attend- 
ance on enrolment ranged from 33 to 51, the highest being in Newark and the lowest at 
Salem and Paterson. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Of 16 schools of this class on the lists of this Bureau 8 have made reports for 1880-81 
at the date at which this matter goes to press. All were in the upper tier of counties. 
For information respecting them individually, see Table V of the appendix to this vol- 
ume; for a summary of their statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
Each incorporated city or town constitutes a single school district, with its school in- 
terests under control of a board of education elected by the people. A city superintend- 
ent of schools and such other persons as the board of education may appoint form a city 
board of examiners.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Bridgeton reported primary and grammar schools, accommodated in 6 buildings con- 
taining 28 rooms, with 1,500 sittings for study, valued, with sites, &c., at $38,000. The 
schools were taught 192 days by 28 teachers. There were 170 enrolled in private schools 
and 586 in no school. 
Camden expended $13,249 for the erection, repair, and furnishing of school buildings, 
and values its entire school property at $466,100. The length of term was 210 days, and 
124 teachers were employed. The pay of men averaged $107.50, that of women $34.16, 
a month. The enrolment in public schools was 7,935; the sittings for study, 6,491. 
There were 1,587 in private schools, and 3,115 not in school.

168 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Elizabeth expended $2,482 for repairs and furniture for its 5 school buildings, which 
contain 47 rooms, with 2,565 sittings, and are valued at $80,000. An enrolment of 3,311, 
with an average attendance of 2,093, in day schools and of 442, with an average attendance 
of 184, in 2 evening schools was given for 1881. The board of examiners issue trial 
certificates to all persons who pass the required examination; after 3 months of success- 
ful teaching a full certificate is granted. Persons holding trial certificates, not teaching, 
are authorized to act as substitutes and to visit the schools and perform such duties as 
may be desired. Full third grade certificates are good for only 2 years without renewal; 
to obtain permanent positions teachers must pass examination for the first or second grade. 
The 51 teaching in 1880~’81 had all obtained the higher certificates. A permanent posi- 
tion at a good salary as teacher of the lowest primary grade has been given to an expe- 
rienced teacher in each primary department. New teachers entering the schools are to 
begin not lower than room 2. There were 2,439 in private schools and 2,875 in no school. 
Hoboken in 1881 reported to the State superintendent a Saturday normal, 1 high, 
4 grammar, and 5 primary schools, and 1 evening school, conducted in 5 buildings, 4 
of them belonging to the city, on which $6,432 had been expended during the year for 
improvements and furniture; the entire school property was valued at $132,500. Day 
schools were taught 202 days; the evening school (divided into 6 classes, 1 devoted 
exclusively to teaching English to German pupils), for4 months. The teachers convene 
monthly to discuss subjects of interest to their profession. There was an estimated 
attendance of 1,496 in private schools and 3,265 children did not attend school. 
Jersey City reported primary, grammar, and high schools and a training school for 
teachers, conducted in 20 buildings, 17 belonging to the ci An expenditure of $10,344 
was made during the year for improvements and the entire school property was valued 
at $657,150. There was an enrolment of 21,373, although the school-houses will seat 
but 14,370 comfortably. The schools were taught 200 days by the 327 teachers; the pay 
of men averaged $124.76 a month; that of women, $29.34. A teachers’ association, or- 
ganized in 1877, holds monthly meetin; Latin, Greek, and German are taught in the 
high school. There were 9,737 children in private schools and 10,000 not attending 
school. 
Millwille expended $3,983 in the erection and furnishing of one new building and in 
repairs on others, and reported its school buildings in good condition, valued, with sites, 
&¢e., at $40,000. The schools are graded and a graduating course was established in the 
high school, the first commencement having been held in 1881. The day schools were 
taught 200 days; the evening schools, with an enrolment of 482 and average attendance 
of 226, were taught 63 evenings, and had 15 teachers. There were 75 in private schools 
and 303 in no school. 
Newark, for 1881, reported 31 primary schools with 176 classes, and 78 classes in the 
grammar schools, 12 being of the first grade, from which 267 pupils passed into the high 
school. The high school, in its classical, scientific, and English courses of 4 years each, 
had: 54 graduates, and in its commercial department 16. The normal training school, 
requiring graduation from the high school or its equivalent for admission, had 27 such 
graduates in a strictly professional course of one year. The evening schools were graded 
as far as possible, and reported an enrolment of 1,712, with an average attendance of 858, 
for a term of 3 months. Music and drawing are taught in all the schools by special 
teachers, and German in the high school. Theschoolsoccupied 32 buildings, 26 of them 
belonging to the city, all containing 15,600 sittings for study and valued, with sites, &c., 
at $910,000. Schools were taught 205 days. There were 6,000 in private schools and 
17,350 in no school. 
New Brunswick maintained its former high standard for regularity and promptness of 
attendance, reporting 315 pupils in June, 1881, who had not lost a day during the year, 
some of this number not a day in 5, 8, and 10 years. The schools were accommodated 
in 6 buildings containing 46 rooms, with 2,175 sittings, valued with sites, &c., at $125,200, 
and were taught 201 days by the 48 teachers. There were 1,200 in private schools and 
2,487 in no school. 
Orange expended $17,393 for buildings, furniture, and repairs, and in September, 1881, 
had 4 school-houses, with sittings for 1,371 pupils, valued, with sites, &c., at $100,000. 
The schools were taught 197 days by the 33 teachers. The high school offers a course of 
4 years and one of 3, and had 11 graduates, 10 of them girls. There were 1,000 in pri- 
vate schools and 1,505 in no school. 
Paterson reported 29 schools and departments, comprising 1 normal and 1 normal train- 
ing school, 1 high, 8 grammar, 3 primary, and 7 evening schools, and 8 primary depart- 
ments of other schools. A systematic course of study has been established, giving 5 
years to the primary, 4 to the grammar, and 4 to the high school. As only 12 per cent. 
of those enrolled pass through the grammar schools and but 2 per cent. through the 
high school, regularity and thoroughness in the primary grades are important. The 
elementary evening schools, in which the length of term varied, had 1,896 enrolled and

36 teachers; the evening high school, with an average attendance of 26, was taught 72 
evenings by 2 2 teachers, and reported special progress in drawing. The city expended 
$13,369 for buildings, furniture, and repairs during the year, and valued its school prop- 
erty at $257,100. ‘There were 1,500 in private schools and 3,536 in no school. 
Plainfield expended $4,975 for the erection and improvement of school-houses and 
valued its school property at $60,000. The length of term was 200 days. There were 
305 in private schools and 456 in no school.

comfortably and are valued, with sites, &c., at $130,000. The schools were taught 200 
days by 3 men and 63 women. There were 2,600 in private schools and 1,634 in no 
school. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. ‘ 
\ NEW JERSEY STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, TRENTON. 
This school, established in 1855, is the chief agency for the supply of well trained 
teachers for the public schools and in 1881 received $20,000 from the State for its 
support. It has an elementary course of 2 years and an advanced course of 3 years; 
uates from the former receive State certificates of the third grade, valid for 7 years; 
those from the latter, second grade certificates, valid for 10 years. An enrolment of 
236 was reported for 1880-’81, with 24 graduates from the advanced and 27 from the 
elementary course; of this number 49 had engaged in teaching. A model school con- 
nected with the institution furnishes the pupils of the normal school opportunity for 
both observation and practice in teaching. Its course of study ranges from elementary 
English through high school and college preparatory courses. There was an enrolment 
of 361, with an average attendance of 284 in 1881; of the 7 graduates, 4 had taken the 
college course. 
FARNUM PREPARATORY SCHOOL, BEVERLY. 
Founded about the same time as the State Normal School and preparing students for 
it, this school receives an annual appropriation from the State. It has primary, inter- 
mediate, preparatory, and senior departments, the first 2 with 3 classes each, the last 2 
with 2classes each, thus serving as a first class graded school, with the lowest rates of 
tuition for Beverly. Its graduates, of whom there were 3 in 1881, may enter the ad- 
vanced class of the normal school and graduate in 1 year. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Normal schools or classes are reported in Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson, 
and teachers’ associations for mutual improvement in school studies and work in Hobo- 
ken and Jersey City. One meeting monthly or oftener has been maintained for many 
years in Burlington County under the leadership of an efficient superintendent, pursuing 
steadily a regular course of study, and there are others in other counties. _Newton Col- 
legiate Institute, Newton, reported normal training, and the Collegiate Institute and 
Business College, Salem, a 3 years’ normal course and an annual teachers’ normal insti- 
tute lasting 6 weeks, consisting of 4 classes, to accommodate those seeking first, second, 
and third grade and State certificates. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Institutes were held during the year in the counties of Atlantic, Burlington, Cam- 
den, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, and Salem. The attendance at all these was 
good, few teachers being absent except for sickness. Able instructors were employed, 
and modern methods of teaching were presented and discussed.— (State report. ) 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. - 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The information in regard to high schools is meagre and correct statistics cannot be 
given. Such schools appear in 1881 at Elizabeth, Hoboken, Jersey City, Millville, New- 
ark, New Brunswick, Orange, Paterson, Phillipsburg, Plainfield, Rahway, and Trenton. 
At Beverly and Trenton some high school studies, preparatory in character, are also pur- 
sued in the higher classes under preparation for the State Normal School. An evening 
high school was maintained tor some months at Paterson in addition to the day school. 
Advanced classes are reported by the superintendent of Camden County, from which 
sane may enter the State Normal School or the Agricultural College at New Bruns- 
wick. .

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR MEN. 
The College of New Jersey, Princeton (non-sectarian), maintained in 1881 (which was the 
one hundred and thirty-fourth year of its existence) its classical, scientific, elective, and 
graduate courses at the high standard of former years. An attendance of 488 in both 
academic and scientific departments was reported; among these were 7 fellows, 41 grad- 
uate and 12 special students. The list of students contained names of representatives 
from 30 States and Territories, as well as from Bulgaria, India, Scotland, and Thrace. 
Every graduate oltaining a six hundred dollar fellowship must devote one year to study 
under the direction of the professors in the department for which the fellowship was pro- 
vided, and must reside in Princeton, unless, by vote of the faculty, he be allowed to 
study at an approved foreign university, in which case he must from time to time fur- 
nish written reports of his work to the professors in his department. The museums and 
apparatus have been increased during the year; a portion of Nassau Hall was arranged 
for the use of the museum, and an observatory was erected and equipped, said to be 
equal to that of any similar institution in the United States.— (Catalogue, 1880-’81.) 
Rutgers College, New Brunswick (non-sectarian), founded in 1770, reported for 1881 no 
changes in its courses of study, which comprise classical, scientific, special, and gradu- 
ate courses. Its students numbered 6 resident graduates, 87 in the classical and 40 in 
the scientific’department, and 11 special students.— (Catalogue. ) 
St. Benedict’s College, Newark, founded in 1868, and Seton Hall College, South Orange, 
founded in 1856 (both Roman Catholic), have preparatory departments and classical and 
commercial courses of study; the former reported 50 students for 1881; the latter, 110, 
with 13 graduates, and 33 in the Diocesan Seminary.— (Catalogues. ) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
For statistics of schools of this class reporting for 1881, see Table VIII of the appendix, 
and a summary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The institutions of this character in the State are Rutgers Scientific School, New Bruns- 
wick; the John C. Green School of Science, Princeton, and the Stevens Institute of Technol- 
ogy, Hoboken. 
Rutgers Scientific School, constituted by act of the legislature the State College for 
Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, offers full 4 years’ courses of study in civil engineer- 
ing and mechanics and in chemistry and agriculture; also, special 2 years’ courses in 
chemistry and in agriculture. Provision is made for graduate studies. 
The John C. Green School of Science, a department of Princeton College, has 2 courses 
in general science: one of 4 years, to be pursued by candidates for the degree of B. S.; 
the other of 2 years, for students who have received a first degree and who are candidates 
for that of M.s. Graduate, advanced, or special students enjoy every facility for study 
and research. 
Stevens Institute of Technology, essentially a school of mechanical engineering, has a 
course of 4 years, each year divided. into a preliminary term (during which the sopho- 
more, junior, and senior classes devote 8 hours a day to experimental mechanics and 
shop work) and 3 regular terms. Beginning with 1882, fuller requirements for admis- 
sion will be made in mathematics and in English, an examination in rhetoric having 
been added. A new workshop, fitted up and furnished with machine and other tools at 
his own expense, was presented to the institute by President Henry Morton in May, 
1881. 
For statistics of these scientific schools, see Table X of the appendix, and a summary 
of the same in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The only professional schools reporting in 1881 were theological, viz: the German Theo- 
logical School of Newark, N. J., at Bloomfield (Presbyterian); Drew Theological Semi- 
nary, Madison (Methodist Episcopal); the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Church 
in America, New Brunswick; the Theological Seminary of the Presbyterian Church, 
Princeton; and the Diocesan Seminary of Seton Hall College, Sonth Orange (Roman Cath- 
olic). The 4 first named have full 3 years’ courses and require candidates for admission 
who are not college graduates to pass an entrance examination. The Seminary at Prince- 
ton has also a graduate course of 1 year. The theological course at Seton Hall College  
-P-A-G-E-449
NEW JERSEY. 171 
comprises 1 year of philosophy and 4 years of theology. The Seminary of the Reformed 
Church received gifts for the improvement of its library, the maintenance of Hertzog 
Hall, and the endowment of 2 scholarships, amounting in all to $90,000.—(Catalogues 
and returns. ) 
For statistics of theological schools, see Table XI of the appendix, and a summary of 
it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF DEAF-MUTES AND THE BLIND. 
From a written report of the State superintendent for 1881, it appears that 153 deaf- 
mutes from New Jersey! were being educated at different institutions in Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania, at a cost of $44,824, and 34 blind at insti- 
tutions in New York and Pennsylvania, at a cost of $9,934. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
In the Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-Minded Children, Elwyn, there were 
50 pupils from New Jersey in 1881, for whose training and improvement the State paid 
$12,454.— (Letter from State superintendent.) 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The New Jersey State Reform School for boys, Jamesburg, reported for 1880 an average 
of 258 inmates, who were being trained in the school room, on the farm, and in the 
shop. No report has been received for 1881. 
The State Industrial School for Girls, Trenton, established in 1870, receives children be- 
tween the ages of 7 and 16, and reported 25 inmates at the close of 1881, who were 
receiving instruction in the common English branghes as well as in household work. 
There were 10 discharged and 15 indentured during the year.— (Return. ) 
The Newark City Home, a reformatory and industrial school supported by the city, re- 
ceives both boys and girls. Its eighth annual report states that 83 inmates were received 
and 64 paroled in 1881. Evidences of progress made in learning and good conduct are 
noted. The boys are taught farming and brush making; the girls, tailoring, dress- 
making, plain sewing, and mending. Regular school instruction in the English branches 
and vocal music is given every day. A system of credits and demerits for disciplinary 
purposes has superseded the severer forms of punishment.— (Annual report.) 
EDUCATION OF ORPHAN AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
Of some 15 institutions for sheltering such children and training them in studies and 
industries till they can be placed at service or in trades, only 4 have made reports for 
1880-’81 at the time at which this goes to press. These are the West Jersey Orphanage, 
Camden; Children’s Home, Burlington County, Mt. Holly; Newark Orphan Asylum, 
Newark; and Paterson Orphan Asylum, Paterson. They report, in all, 18 teachers in 
studies or industries, 1,225 cared for since the foundation of the associations or institu- 
tions, and 171 remaining at the date of their reports. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATIONS. 
Of meetings of the State Teachers’ Association and the State Association of School 
Superintendents no account is contained in the State report for 1881. The only account 
that has reached the Bureau is an announcement and programme in the New-England 
Journal of Education of the State Teachers’ Association to be held at Long Branch, July 
6-7 of that year.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
General educational interests continued to be under the supervision of a State super- 
intendent of public instruction, elected by the legislature for a term of three years, and 
of a board of regents of the university,! having oversight of academic, collegiate, and pro- 
fessional training. 
For the local management of the common school interests there still were district 
school commissioners (nearly answering to county superintendents elsewhere), elected 
by the people for 3 years; boards of district trustees of 1 or 3 members, the term of a 
sole trustee being 1 year, but if 3 trustees were elected, there being an annual change of 
1; in union districts, boards of from 3 to 9 members take the place of the district boards. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The common schools of the State continued to be free to all persons 5-21 years of 
age residing in the district, and also to non-residents at the discretion of the trustees. 
To supply this free schooling, the State levies an annual tax; this in 1881 was 1.14 
mill on $1, which, with the income from the United States deposit fund and common’ 
school fund, amounted to about $3,400,000; while the people by voluntary local taxa- 
tion raised about $7,400,000 more. According to law the greater part of these large 
sums is paid for teachers’ wages; for buildings, sites, furniture, and repairs; for appa- 
ratus, libraries, colored schools, and various incidental expenses; for training teachers 
in academies, institutes, and normal schools under State direction. The remainder, 
about $130,000, is divided between academies, Cornell University, Elmira Female Col- 
lege, the school commissioners, department of public instruction, regents of the univer- 
sity, and a few remaining Indian schools. 
‘The annual apportionment of the school money is made by the State superintendent 
under specific direction of the school law. To entitle a district to its quota,the trustees of 
the preceding year must have reported that a common school was taught by a qualified 
teacher or teachers during the legal school year of 28 weeks of 5 days each. The basis 
of apportionment, heretofore partly on the number of children of school age and partly 
on average attendance, has been changed. The portion of the fund formerly distributed 
on the basis of average attendance is now given practically on the basis of aggregate 
attendance, the aggregate attendance in each school district being now divided by 140, 
the number of days in the legal school year. The State superintendent believes that 
this amendment will tend to lengthen terms in the respective districts. 
To bea legally qualified teacher and entitled to pay from the public money, one must 
have a diploma from a State normal school or a certificate of qualification from some 
one of the school officers authorized by law to give such certificates. 
It is the duty of every school commissioner to organize in his district, once in each 
year, a teachers’ institute, and to induce, if possible, all the teachers in his district to at- 
tend (which they do without loss of pay for time thus spent), the commissioner being 
always subject to the advice and direction of the State superiftendent. 
The State dnnually appropriates $50,000 for district libraries; but, notwithstanding 
the existence of various legal provisions intended to preserve the libraries and extend the 
field of their usefulness, the number of volumes reported in them falls off year by year, 
and the State superintendent has repeatedly recommended that the money appropriated 
for books be used in the purchase of apparatus or devoted to the establishment of village 
and township libraries. 
The law passed in 1880 conferring upon women the right to vote in district school 
meetings and to hold school offices being found inadequate, it was amended in 1881. 
Under its liberal construction by the department of public instruction, women now en- 
joy the same privileges as men in these respects, and the State superintendent confidently 
predicts a continuance of the improvement in school interests which has already resulted 
from the change. 
In the absence of any statutory provision respecting a legal school month, a calendar 
month is held to be such by the State department of education. 
GENERAL CONDITION, 
‘The statistics of 1880-81, compared with those of 1879-’80, show that while there 
ewere 20,949 more youth to be taught, the enrolment in the public schools fell off 10,311 
andthe average attendance 13,690. The State superintendent does not ascribe this toany 
decline of interest in the public schools, but to the business activity of the year, which 
led many of the youth over 14 into manufacturing and business life. On the contrary,    
            
  board is composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and superin- tendent of public instruction, with 19 other persons elected for life service, and styled “Regents of the University of the State of New York.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-452
  174 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
he thinks that the system has increased in efficiency in greater proportion than the at- 
tendance has fallen off, and that the results attained justify the large expenditures neces- 
sarily incurred. While there was a decline of 258 at private or church schools and of 50 
at law schools, the colleges showed an advance in attendance of 2,610, themedical schools 
of 490, the normal schools of 191, and academies of 205. With these gains there was 
still a decrease of 7,123 in the whole number underinstruction. School districts fell off 
16 and school-houses 5. “ Log houses are gradually disappearing and giving place to brick 
or stone buildings. - School property advanced $344,121 in value. The school district 
library system showed its usual decline in the number of volumes, which this year 
reached 28,494. As to teachers, the review of the school year is a little more encourag- 
ing. While there were 323 fewer men teaching in the public schools, there were 419 
more women, being a total gain of 96. Of the 30,826 employed, 20,731 taught for the 
fall term, a gain of 134 over the previous year; 27 more held normal school diplomas; 
188 more, licenses from local officers, though there were 119 fewer licenses from the State 
superintendent. Teachers’ institutes were held in 58 counties, in 18 of which 2 sessions 
were held, besides 1 for the benefit of the teachers on the Indian reservations, making 77 
in all. The falling off of 2,195 in attendance of teachers while only 2 fewer institutes 
were held is a fact indicating decline of interest on the part of teachers and weakness in 
the system of optional attendance. In teachers’ wages there was no appreciable ad- 
vance, though the school income was increased by $483,402; expenditures were $511,026 
greater. There was a gain of $25,316 in the value of the school fund, exclusive of any 
gain that may have taken place in the United States deposit fund, the amount of which 
has not been reported since 1878.— (State report.) 
INDIAN SCHOOLS. 
The remnants of 7 tribes of Indians still retain reservations in the northern section of 
the State and are included in the public school system of the State. They reported 
for 1880-’81 a school population of 1,607, an enrolment of 1,175, and an average daily 
attendance of 570; there was an increase of 17 in children of school age and of 11 in 
enrolment, but a decrease of 55 in average attendance. For the support of these schools 
the State annually appropriates about $9,000. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The report of 1879-’80 presents a list of 52 of these schools. Thus far in 1880-81 
but 28 have presented statistics. Among these are 4 important normal training schools, 
1 for deaf-mutes, and several free Kindergiirten for the children of the poor, while 3 have 
been discontinued. For further information, see Table V of the appendix. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
Cities are generally organized under special charters which provide that the public 
schools shall be under the supervision of boards elected by the people, these boards vary- 
ing in number and title. Usually also a superintendent is chosen by the board. 
In New York City the mayor appoints a board of education composed, since 1873, of 
24 commissioners. He also appoints 3 inspectors of common schools for each of the eight 
school districts into which thecity isdivided. One-third of both the board and inspectors 
are liable to change each year. A superintendent of schools and 7 assistant superintend- 
ents are elected by the board of education for terms of 2 years, and also 5 trustees for 
each ward, 1 of the 5 being changed each year.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Albany made important additions to its school buildings, having completed one with 
616 sittings, valued with lot and furniture at $19,942; and in place of an old one erected. 
another, said to be a model of completeness; still a third was being remodelled and ma- 
terially improved. This gave to the city 26 public school buildings, affording 11,857 
sittings; school property was valued at $765,397. A decrease of 73 in enrolment from 
the preceding year and of 285 in average membership was attributed to enlarged oppor- 
tunities for industrial employment. An official examination as to how many had left 
school during the year to engage in some permanent employment, a useful line of gen- 
eral investigation, showed the number to be 870. Tardiness was reduced 50 per cent., 
but the half day absences increased 2.6 per cent. There were 649 cases of truancy (with 
not more than 500 truants, the superintendent thinks). The superintendent suggests 
the appointment of truant officers to enforce the provisions of the compulsory education 
act, and advocates the establishment of an ungraded school for the instruction and reforma- 
tion of truants. Of the 252 teachers reported, 227 were females. The schools were 
taught 197 days and the average number of days lost by these teachers was only 2.8. 
Discipline had been all that could be desired. On an average attendance of nearly 9,000 
there were only about 6 cases of corporal punishment daily. The courses of study re- 
mained substantially the same as 2 years ago. The system of written examinations in 
all the schools except the high continued to work well, the classes marked excellent 
exceeding those of last year by 386. A quotation exercise which had worked well in the 
high school was recommended for the lower grades. The progress in reading was satis- 
factory, sight reading being general. The study of language was increased, doing away 
with the old method of parsing, the result being seen in the fact that 290 passed the 
regents’ examination, being 66 more than the year before. Great improvement in pen- 
manship was secured by using pen and ink in the second and third year grades. Free 
hand drawing received increased attention, and was to be extended to the senior class of 
the high school, thus making a continuous course from the lowest to the highest grade. 
This, with music, French, German, and chemistry, was taught by special teachers.— 
(City report and return.) 
Auburn classed its public schools as high, grammar, and primary. The 11 school 
buildings were found to be insufficient for the increased school population, but a propo- 
sition to increase the accommodations was negatived by a vote of the people. Three of 
these 11 buildings with 39 rooms were occupied by the primary schools, 7 with 16 rooms 
by the grammar, and 1 with three rooms by the high school, together affording sittings 
for 3,334 and valued, with other school property, at $154,200. Only about 40 per cent. 
of the youth of school age were found in the schools, while enrolment increased 135 and 
average attendance 75. Of teachers (all women but 2) there were 2 more than the year before. Two special teachers in music and drawing were employed. Discipline was 
reported as generally good, the only exceptions occurring under unskilful and inexperi- 
enced teachers. There were 110 fewer cases of corporal punishment, and the superin- 
tendent reported the year as one of exceptional quiet and substantial progress. Private 
or parochial schools occupied 3 buildings, with an enrolment of 1,200 and 17 teachers,—

  176 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Binghamton enrolled 63 per cent. of its school population of 4,778 and retained 43 per 
cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance. Of these 8 per cent. were too young 
to attend profitably. In the period from 8 to 13, inclusive, which years come under 
the provisions of the compulsory school law, the absenteeism reached 9 per cent.; in 
that from 14 to 16, inclusive, when youth begin business life, 26 per cent.; in that from 
17 to 18, inclusive, which closes the system of public school instruction, 25 per cent. ; in 
that from 19 to 20, which lies entirely beyond the grades of city schools, 26 per cent. 
The school system embraces 7 ward schools, a grammar and a high school; these are all 
ed in 12 grades, each, except the first, covering 1 year of three terms, the seventh 
and eighth constituting the grammar, the other 4 the high school grade. There was a. 
loss of 147 in enrolment and of 128 in average daily attendance, while in teachers there 
was a gain of 6, there being 58 women and 6 men teachers. No special teaching in mu- 
sic, drawing, or penmanship appears. In the 8 school buildings reported, the primary 
schools occupied 2,038 sittings; the grammar, 574; the high school, 185. School property 
was valued at $197,349; enrolment in private or parochial schools was estimated at 528. 
(City report and return. ) 
The Brooklyn board of education, consisting of 45 members, divides the general super- 
vision of the public schools among 21 standing committees; more special supervision 
is intrusted to local committees. There were 57 school buildings, all in good condition. 
The entire school property was valued at $4,943,553. While the buildings afforded sit- 
tings for 66,300 pupils and average attendance was 53,194, the enrolment for the year was 
96,077. From 3,000 to 5,000 in the primary classes wi ere crowded into basement rooms 
and old dwelling houses. It was estimated that from 5,000 to 10,000 more would attend 
the public schools if better accommodations were provided; not less than $400,000 were 
deemed necessary to make suitable provision. The expenditure of $1,037,901 during 
the year was inadequate for the needs of the schools, but the city refused to furnish the 
additional accommodations desired and thousands of children were obliged to wait, while 
thousands more were taught in half day sessions. The schools continued to be classed 
as primary, intermediate, and grammar, butin some grades more was required than could 
be accomplished in the time allowed; and over 100 inexperienced young girls are annu- 
ally placed over classes of infant pupils. An intelligent review of the courses was called 
for. The city school system includes the educational departments of 9 orphan asylums 
and industrial schools partially supported by religious societies or individuals. These 
schools are under the same jurisdiction as the publ and during the hours allotted 
to secular studies, from 9 to 3, no religious instruction is given. During the year 2,294 
children were taught by well qualified teachers and enjoyed bet commodations than 
the public school pupils; they were sustained at a cost P $42 There 
were taught during the winter 13 evening schools, including 2 high schools; in the first 
division of the school term there was an enrolment of 7,610 pupils ‘under 201 ‘teachers; in 
the second division, 5,328 pupils under 192 teachers. Music and drawing were taught 
byspecial teachers. The work in penmanship showed special improvement as the result 
of using pen and ink in the primary classes, instead of slate and pencil. To abate the 
evil of inexperienced teachers in the primary schools, it was decided to form classes on 
the Kindergarten plan, and ask for $5,000 to pay teachers to be employed in this work. 
The establishment of industrial schools for the thousands of poor children not in the 
public schools was urged upon the attention of the board as a measure both of economy 
and safety to society. — (City report and return ) 
Buffalo, with a’school population of 60,000, an increase of 4,000, had 42 school build- 
ings, valued, with other school property, at $780,000, and 20,433 volumes in the school 
library, valued at $19,694. The enrolment advanced 897 and average daily attendance 
230. One additional teacher was employed and the expenditures were $3,829 higher. 
Only 42 per cent. of the school population were enrolled in the public schools, and but 24 
per cent. of it were in average daily attendance.— (State report.) 
Cohoes reported 7 school buildings, and a school library of 1,638 volumes, which, with 
buildings and sites, were valued at $86,800. The school population increased 527 and en- 
rolment 566, but in average daily attendance there was a loss of 65; 10 more teachers 
were employed and $4,000 more expended. ‘There were registered in public schools only 
38 per cent. of the school population, while only 17 per cent. of it appeared in average 
daily attendance. This showing from the State report of 62 per cent. of school popula- 
tion as not registered and 83 per cent. of it not in daily attendance in the public schools 
cannot be explained in the absence of any official report from the city superintendent.— 
(State report. ) 
Elmira had 8 school buildings, a gain of 2 over the previous year, affording 3,825 sit- 
tings. The older buildings were remodelled and thoroughly repaired; school property 
was valued at $316,000. As reported last year, the schools were classed as primary, in- 
termediate, advanced, and academic, each having 3 divisions of 1 yea As compared 
with 1879-’80 the statistics of attendance, teachers, and expenditures show only slight

changes; 69 per cent. of the school population was enrolled and 71 per cent. of the enrol- 
ment was in average daily attendance. The promotion of teachers according to meritorious 
service, instead of on yearly examinations, was continued. The evening schools hereto- 
fore reported were discontinued.— (Return and. proceedings of board of education. ) 
Hudson reported 3 brick school buildings, and a school library of 1,000 volumes, valued 
with other school, property at $31,000. With an increase of 87 in enrolment and the 
same number of teachers as last year, the city expended for its public schools $3,318 less 
than in the previous year. The school population increased 245, but only 38.6 percent. 
of it was enrolled in the city schools and only 25 per cent. of it was in average daily 
attendance.— (State report.) . 
Ithaca erected 1 school building during the year, making 6inall. The 6 afforded 1,730 
sittings for study and were valued with other school property at $60,200. There was 
a slight decrease in attendance, but this was caused by the prevalence of scarlet fever 
during the spring term. The average daily attendance was 50.5 per cent. of school 
population, exteeding that of most of the cities in the State. The board had absorbed, 
during the year, all the elementary schools in the city except a Kindergarten and a pre- 
paratory school for Cornell University. The number of teachers remained the same. 
The schools, taught 191 days of the year, were classed as primary, intermediate, gram- 
mar, and high, with grades covering 12 years, 4 of which are spent in the high school. 
Vocal music was taught in all the courses. Estimated enrolment in private or paro- 
chial schools, 75.— (City report and return.) 
Kingston had 8 school buildings, affording sittings for 1,671 pupils. The schools are 
classed as preparatory, high, and academic. The preparatory includes primary, junior, 
and senior courses, each having 3 grades, making 9 years of woyk below the high school 
and academy. The studies of the high school are not distinctly given. Those of the 
academy are arranged under 3 courses, one in literature and science and a collegiate 
preparatory, each of 3 years, with a higher English course, embracing all the advanced 
English branches included in the other courses. There were 75 pupils, 67 of whom pur- 
sued the advanced English course, and 10 graduated with honor. A large class from the 
high school was sent up, 49 of its 81 pupils having passed the regents’ examination, not 
including those who had passed after entering the academy. With no change reported 
in the school population, there was a considerable falling off in. enrolment, a slightloss 
in average daily attendance, and a loss of 5 teachers. The fact that many of the older 
students, in consequence of business activity, had begun active life accounts in part for 
the decrease. The number of days of study lost by pupils was 782 more than last year. 
The standard for promotion in all the departments was raised, yet nearly all examined 
passed. Music and drawing entered into the instruction of all the courses.— (City re- 
ort.) 
y Lockport reported 6 school buildings and a school library of 3,881 volumes; value of 
school property, $110,600. In enrolment there was a gain of 154 and in average daily 
attendance of 40, although expenditures fell off $1,440. The schools registered 68 per 
cent. of the school population, and retained 40 per cent. of it in average daily attend- 
ance. There were 6 private and parochial schools, with 400 pupils enrolled. In the 
absence of a city return and report for 1880-81 no further information can be given.— 
(State report.) 
Long Island City had for its 5,717 school population 7 school buildings, 4 of them leased. 
One of thosé built by the city at a cost of $20,000 is said to be the only excellent school 
building in the place. All, with sites, were valued at $65,000. The schools, classed as 
primary and grammar, were taught by 50 teachers and enrolled 67 per cent. of the school 
population; 57 per cent. of the enrolment were in average daily attendance. Private 
and parochial schools enrolled 203 pupils. Few public school pupils remain to complete 
the grammar course. New methods of teaching grammar, arithmetic, geography, and 
history were adopted with gratifying results.— (City report.) 
Newburgh reported slight changes in its publicschools. In school population there was 
a gain of 15; in teachers, including 2 in evening schools, of 6; with an increase of $622 in 
expenditures; while in enrolment there was a loss of 23, and in average daily attend- 
ance of 90. The free schools enrolled 56.25 per cent. of the school population, and 64 
per cent. of the enrolment were in average daily attendance. The board had 6 school 
buildings, with 2,500 sittings, of which 1,500 were used by the primary, 600 by the gram- 
mar, and 150 by evening schools, and 250 by the highschool. School property was val- 
ued at $192,000. Schools were in session 200 days. Enrolled in private and parochial 
schools, 701.— (Return. ) 
New York City reported, for its 393,000 school population, 130 school buildings, with 
150,484 sittings, all valued, with sites and otherschool property, at $11,775,000. During 
the year 3 new buildings, with sittings for 4,900 pupils, were completed and occupied, 
which, with other improvements, gave a net gain of 5,450 sittings. To provide this ad- 
ditional school room and sustain the schools during the year cost, as shown in the table,

  $3,690,283. Yet with this immense outlay 9,189 children were refused admission to the 
schools for want of room. It was aserious question whether the board would be able to 
gain upon the steady advance of the school population, of whom there were 8,000 more 
than in 1880. Under the care of the board of education, and sharing in the school fund, 
were 299 schools, consisting of a normal college for girls (with a training department), 46 
grammar schools for boys, 46 for girls, and 12 for both sexes, 69 primary departments of 
grammar schools, 44 separate primary schools, 4 colored schools, 48 industrial and re- 
formatory schools, orphan asylums, &c., 27 evening schools, and 1 nautical school, giving 
a total in the 299 schools of 274,040 pupils, 133,161 of them in average attendance. To 
these should be added 40,000 in private and parochial schools. Of those in the public 
system, 2,043 were in the normal college and 1,611 in the training school connected 
with it. There were 1,317 colored children enrolled, 107 in the city nautical school, 
24,180 in corporate schools, and 16,096 in eveningschools. The statistics of attendance 
compared with 1879-80 show a gain of 8,458 inthe number taught and of 1,691 in aver- 
age attendance. There were 3,443 teachers employed (excluding 77 special teachers, but 
including the 271 engaged inevening schools), of whom 418 were men and 3,025 women, 
the total of whose salaries was $2,541,508. Of these, 37 were in the normal college and 
27 in its training department and 199 in the corporate schools. During the year licenses 
were given to 389 applicants for teachers’ certificates. The first licenses are provisional, 
to be made permanent when the teacher has given proof of ability to do satisfactory 
work. As to the quality of instruction given and discipline maintained, thefiguresshow, 
as the result of examinations, that of 2,690 classes instructed in the primary departments, 
the grammar, primary, and colored schools, 1,827 were marked excellent, 819 good, 42 
fair, and 2 indifferent; while in discipline of the same schools, out of 2,749 classes, 2,498 
were reported excellent, 232 good, 15 fair, 3 indifferent, and 1bad. Only 97 pupils were 
suspended (this being 100 less than 2 years before and 53 less than the previous year), 
and 20 of these were restored. This degree of discipline was obtained without resorting 
to corporal punishment. To facilitate promotions from the primary departments and 
primary schools, the course of gtudy is arranged in 6 grades, each requiring no more than 
can be accomplished in 5 months by a child of ordinary capacity, so that one in the low- 
est primary grade can reach the lowest grammar grade in 3years. Changes made inthe 
way of teaching reading, spelling, arithmetic, grammar, composition, and history gave 
satisfaction. Of the whole number of classes in reading, only 2 per cent. were deficient; 
of 2,690 in spelling 2,277 were excellent; of 2,690 in arithmetic 1,765 were excellent, 
790 good, and 118 fair, this being regarded as among the studies most successfully 
taught. Of 1,889 in penmanship 1,596 were excellent. Slate writing continued to be 
an important element in the work of the lower grades. In United States history there 
was an average gain of 4 per cent. in proficiency. Instruction in some department of 
elementary science was given orally to all the grammar grades, and to the primary in 
object lessons; of 2,690 classes examined, 2,078 were rated excellent. In drawing gen- 
eral progress was reported, showing an average proficiency of 93 per cent. In the graded 
course of music the reports show satisfactory results. German and French were studied 
in 83 of the 104 grammar departments. The nautical school for the training of boys de- 
siring to be seamen, which began eight years ago, continued to be a useful feature of the 
public system, having had during the year a monthly attendance of 107. On the annual 
summer cruise the ship sailed 9,000 miles, after which the school was examined by the 
Chamber of Commerce, and 46 graduated, nearly all of whom immediately found places. 
More than 60 graduates of the school are now serving as officers. The corporate schools 
were held under the auspices of 16 reformatory, benevolent, and industrial societies. Of 
the 24,130 children taught in these schools, 10,978 poor children who could not attend 
the public schools were registered in the schools of the Children’s Aid Society. In the 
25 primary evening schools conducted during the year under the system adopted by the 
board in 1880 there was great improvement in punctuality, regularity, scholarship, and 
discipline. All under 13 were excluded, and there was an increase of 810 adults over 
last year. The board endeavored through these schools to meet the needs of foreign im- 
migrants desiring to learn English; a graded course of instruction for them was adopted 
during the year, and out of the 15,150 pupils enrolled in evening schools below the even- 
ing high school 1,712 were foreigners studying English, and there were 3,840 other 
foreign pupils engaged in the same study. On admission 1,452 of the whole number of 
pupils could not read and 1,625 could not write; 2,157 studied reading, 1,795 arithme- 
tic, 568 composition, 2,773 penmanship, and 988 book-keeping. The work done by the 
truancy department is worthy of especial notice. During the year 17,378 visits were 
made, of which 11,536 were to homes, 4,223 to schools, and 1,619 to stores and factories. 
The cases investigated numbered 8,990; outof these 2,132 truants were returned to school 
and 395 non-attendants placed in school, 2,331 were kept at home by parents, 1,675 by 
sickness, and 252 by poverty, while 359 had been withdrawn from school and gone to 
work or left the city.— (City report and return.)

Ogdensburg provided 10 buildings for its school population of 3,886, and a school 
library of 3,675 volumes, the whole valued at $62,575. There was a loss of 158 in school 
population, a gain of 152 in enrolment and of 37 in average attendance, and an increase 
of $3,888 in expenditures. The number enrolled in public schools was 57 per cent. of 
the school population, and the average attendance was a fraction more than 29 per cent. 
of the same. Allowing for the 572 in private schools, there still remained 1,092 not in 
school.— (State report. ) 
Oswego reported 14 school buildings, with 3,760 sittings, which provided for only 47 
per cent. of its school population. School property was valued at $168,380. The public 
schools were classed as primary, junior, and senior, with a 3 years’ course in each, 
and high, with a 4 years’ eourse, besides an unclassified school. School statistics gener- 
ally show a slight reduction, with the exception of expenditures, which rose $6,531. 
Only 47.3 per cent. of theschool population were enrolled. Private and parochial schools 
enrolled 1,268.— (Return. ) 
Plattsburgh had 6 school buildings, 5 being used by the primary schools, with 1,010 
sittings; the intermediate and grammar departments occupied rooms in the high school 
building and had 286 sittings, the high school using the 88 remaining seats. With 
lot and furniture, the-high school building cost $45,000; total value of school property, 
$57,000. The schools, taught by 26 teachers and classed as primary, intermediate, 
grammar, and high, were graded to cover 12 years, of 3 terms each, giving to the primary 
and grammar 3 years each, to the intermediate 2, and to the high 4 years. _ Private and 
parochial schools enrolled 80. Teachers of primary schools may, at their discretion, 
dismiss those children who have completed their exercises for that session an hour before 
the regular time of closing.— (Manual and return. 
Poughkeepsie reported 10 school buildings, with 2,770 sittings. It had a school library 
of 10,900 volumes. The school buildings, sites, and property were valued at $145,108. 
Its 10 schools continued to be classed as introductory, primary, grammar, and high, with 
grades covering 12 years, and including the second department of the high school in the 
grammar grade, each grade occupied 3 years. Compared with 1879-’80, there was a loss 
in schools of 2, in enrolment of 369, and in average attendance of 105; in teachers there 
was a gain of 2, and an increase of $2,819 in expenditures. Efforts were made to reduce 
irregularity and tardiness. Only 19 cases of suspension were reported and promotions 
increased over 3 per cent. An unusually high average was reached in the regents’ ex- 
aminations, especially in the grammar grades. In drawing there was a decided revival 
of interest, and the year’s work was satisfactory. Private and parochial schools enrolled 
828.— (State and city reports and city return. ) 
Rochester reported 27 school buildings, with 13,030 sittings, which was 351 less than 
the enrolment in the public schools and 23,970 less than the school population. Allow- 
ing for the 3,500 in private and parochial schools, there remain 20,470 not provided for 
in the city school system. The public schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, 
were taught by 255 teachers, including a teacher of German. In enrolment there was a 
gain of 510. The statistics of 1880-81, including the number reported in the private 
and parochial schools, gave a total of 16, ‘881 under instruction during the year, yet this 
was under 46 per cent, of the school population. — (Return. ) 
Rome, with a school population of 3,129, had 8 public school buildings, with 2,050 sit- 
tings, valued, with other school property, at $75,250. The public schools, reported as 
primary, grammar, and high, were taught by 3 male and 28 female teachers, including 
1 special teacher in drawing, during 198 days. The enrolment of 1,700 during the year 
was 54.3 per cent. of the school population; the average attendance included 46.6 per 
gent. of the school population and nearly 84 per cent. of the enrolment. Private and 
parochial schools enrolled 465.—(Return.) 
Saratoga Springs had 12 school buildings, with 1,726 sittings; with other school prop- 
erty, these were valued at $69,300. School population, enrolment, average attendance, 
and teaching force fell off slightly. The public schools continued to be classed as pri- 
mary, junior, grammar, and academic, the last having a course of 3 years. Singing, 
calisthenics, and drawing were taught throughout the entire course, the music being 
under a special teacher. Schools were in session 200 days and were taught by 5 male 
and 27 female teachers. An evening school, taught by the principal of the grammar de- 
partment, enrolled 34 pupils, with an average attendance of 17. ‘The attendance for the 
year shows good teaching, the enrolment being 61.9 per cent. of the school population, 
while nearly 70 per cent. of the enrolment was in average daily attendance. Including 
319 in private and parochial schools and 34 in the evening school, nearly 75 per cent. of 
the school population was under instruction.— (City report and return.) 
Schenectady had for its 4,844 school population 9 school buildings and a library of 3,100 
volumes, valued, with other school property, at $76,800. There was a slight gain in 
school population and enrolment, the latter being 48.3 per cent. of the former, while the

average daily attendance reached 65 per cent. of the enrolment. In the 4 private and 
parochial schools there was an enrolment of 500.— (State report.) 
Syracuse had 19 school buildings with 8,333 sittings, being 1,046 less than the num- 
ber of pupils enrolled and 10,265 less than the school population. The buildings, with 
other school property and a district library of 14,163 volumes, were valued at $804,900. 
The public schools, classed as primary, junior, senior, and high, were taught 196 days by 
11 male and 175 female teachers, including 2 special teachers in drawing and penman- 
ship. An evening school, enrolling about 50 pupils, was taught by 1 male teacher. The 
school population increased 316 and enrolment 103; in average attendance there was a 
loss of 252. The average daily attendance embraced nearly 75 per cent. of the enrol- 
ment. Adding the 1,862 enrolled in private and parochial schools to those in the pub- 
lic schools, there were 11,241 under instruction, being a fraction over 60 per cent. of the 
school population.— (State report and return.) 
Troy reported 14 public school buildings and a district library of 1,100 volumes, which 
with buildings and lots were valued at $235,850. The statistics show that with an 
increase of 236 in school population enrolment fell off 406, average daily attendance 
780, and number of teachers 5; the schools cost $2,278 more. Only 44.5 per cent. of the 
children of school age were enrolled during the year, and only 58 per cent. of the enrol- 
ment was in average attendance. In the 20 private and parochial schools there was an 
enrolment of 1,200.— (State report.) 
Utica in 1880-81 had 18 public school-houses with 4,690 sittings, a library of nearly 
8,000 volumes, and other school property, all valued at $708,571. The total of sittings, 
including 1,400 in the private and parochial schools, furnished school room for only 50.5 
per cent. of the children of school age. The enrolment in the public schools was as fol- 
lows: in the primary, 2,614; in the intermediate, 1,500; in the advanced, 671; in the 
academy, 172; in the ungraded, 85; in the 2 evening schools, 276. The statistics show 
that while there was a gain of 236 in school youth and of 5 in teachers, there was a loss 
of 173 in enrolment, of 328 in average daily attendance, and a decrease of $5,330 in ex- 
penditures. Besides the 97 regular teachers, there were 5 special ones in penmanship, 
music, drawing, French, and German, and 5 substitute teachers. The average daily 
attendance embraced nearly 64 per cent. of the enrolment. Discipline was well main- 
tained, there being only 2 cases of suspension for tardiness, 29 for misconduct, and no expul- 
sions. The schools below the academy are the primary, with a 2 years’ course, and the 
intermediate and advanced, with 3 years each. The evil of grading schools too rigidly 
was avoided by so arranging the classes in each grade that a pupil could be promoted 
when proficient without being delayed for those behind him.— (City report and return.) 
Watertown reported 9 school-houses, a district library of 4,000 volumes, and other school 
property, valued at $99,000. The statistics of attendance for 1880-’81 show 64.4 per 
cent. of school population enrolled in the public schools, including 100 in private and 
parochial schools. The average daily attendance reached 62 per cent. of the enrolment.— 
(State report. ) 
Yonkers for 1880-’81 reported 5 public school- houses, a district library with 2,961 
volumes, and other school property, valued at $128,993. Private and parochial schools 
enrolled 1,492. Of the enrolment 53 per cent. was in average daily attendance.— (State 
report.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Eight schools of this class, to train teachers for serviceable work in the State school 
system, have been established by law at Albany, Brockport, Buffalo, Cortland, Fredo- 
nia, Geneseo, Oswego, and Potsdam, the oldest being that at Albany (1844), the two 
youngest those at Buffalo and Geneseo (1871). All are under the general supervision 
of the State superintendent of public instruction, the regents of the University being 
associated with him in the case of the school at Albany. All have connected with them 
model or practice departments, and all but those at Albany and Oswego had also, at the 
date of the last reports, academic departments, relics of former academies, not reck- 
oned as integral parts of the normal schools. Except at Albany, where the same rule 
formerly obtained, each county is restricted in the numberof normal pupils it may enter 
at these schools to twice the total of its representatives in the State assembly; and all 
such pupils must be at least 16 years of age! They must pass a satisfactory examina- 
tion, to be admitted to the first year of any class, with corresponding advance in age 
and in qualification for admission to advanced classes. The course at Albany isof 2years; 
at the other schools it is of 2, 3, or 4, according to the grade of position sought, the 
divisions being into elementary’ English, advanced. English, and classical. The in- 
structors in the 8 schools in 1881 numbered 120 ; the graduates for the year, 273. The 
statistics of attendance it is more difficult to give with certainty, but according to a table 
in the State report for 1881 the whole number of normal students was 2,930.

OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The Normal College of New York City (the annual reports of which cover a calendar 
year, not the State school year), December 31, 1881, had 1,214 normal students on its 
register, with an average attendance of 1,127; it admitted from the common schools, on 
competitive examination, 702 and graduated from the required 3 years’ course 309 and 
from the voluntary 4 years’ course 20. In the training department 1,612 children had 
been taught by 726 pupil teachers. During the 11 years of its existence up to 1881, the 
college had graduated 2,500 teachers, over 1,000 of whom were then doing good work in 
the common schools of the city. It was found, however, that the supply of teachers 
was exceeding the demand, and measures were taken to reduce the number of graduates 
as nearly as possible to the number required to fill the vacancies in the city schools. 
With this view it was determined to add a fourth year of required study to the course, 
and graduation of students was to be omitted in 1882. It was believed that the more 
extended course, the increased age of the teachers when beginning their work, and the 
greater maturity of mind consequent upon the higher studies of the fourth year course 
would greatly improve the system of publiceducation. The twoexaminationseach year 
heretofore required for admission were reduced to one.— (City report.) 
A training school at Syracuse, organized 1880, with a course of 20 weeks, giving time 
for 2 classes in a year and consisting of female graduates of the high school who wished 
to become teachers, graduated 15. It was proposed to extend the 20 weeks’ course to 
the entire high school year.— (City report). Alfred University showed in its latest cir- 
cular a normal course of 4 years in its college department; St. Lawrence University, 
a teachers’ class in which regular and systematic instruction was given by the president. 
The city of Utica reported a normal course of 2 years, English and scientific, with certifi- 
cate of studies pursued. Binghamton was considering the expediency of adding a train- 
ing department to its school system. The school authorities of Brooklyn proposed to 
organize 2 training schools, one in the eastern and the other in the western part of the 
city, and an appropriation of $100,000 was called for to erect suitable buildings. 
There were in New York City 4 schools to train teachers for Kindergarten work. 
For their statistics, reference is made to Table V of the appendix. 
TEACHERS’ CLASSES IN ACADEMIES AND COLLEGES. 
The law of 1877 which provides that the regents of the University may designate 
academies and union schools in the several counties of the State in which normal in- 
struction shall be given also provides that every school so designated shall instruct a 
class of not less than 10 nor more than 25 of such students, that each scholar admitted 
to these classes shall continue under instruction not less than 10 successive weeks, and 
that payments shall be made at the rate of $1 for each week’s instruction of each 
scholar. Owing to the insufficiency of the income from the United States deposit fund, 
the only classes appointed for 1880-’81 were in the spring term of the 100 institutions 
of this character designated.— (State report. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
During 1880-’81 there were held 77 institutes in 58 counties, with an attendance of 
13,209 teachers, averaging 227 to each county and 171 to each institute held. The re- 
port gives 74.8 per cent. of attendance on the number of teachers in the counties where 
the institutes were held. The cost to the State was $16,937, an average of $292 to each 
county and of $1.28.t0 each teacher. An important advance was made by the superin- 
tendent'in the employment of a corps of professional institute conductors; and, although 
there was a decrease of 2,195 in attendance from the previous year, there was none, it 
is claimed, in the interest manifested and the good done. In 18 of the counties 2 insti- 
tutes were held and also 1 at Salamanca for the benefit of the teachers on the Allegany 
and Cattaraugus Indian reservations.— (State report.) 
  EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
* The following school journals continued their issues in 188081: the School Bulletin, 
monthly organ of the State Teachers’ Association, published at Syracuse, was in its 
seventh and eighth volumes; the School Journal, which had dropped the New York part 
of its title, and was published weekly at New York City, continued, but without clear 
indication of its volumes; the Teachers’ Institute, published monthly at the office of 
the School Journal, was in its third and fourth volumes; the Kindergarten Messen- 
ger, transferred from Milwaukee to Syracuse, and published monthly from the office of 
the Bulletin, was in its fifth volume; the American Kindergarten Magazine, monthly, New 
York City, was in its fourth volume; the Industrial News, published monthly by the 
Inventors’ Institute, Cooper Union, New York City, was in its second volume; while 
the Sanitary Engineer, in its fourth volume, and Scientific American, in its forty-fifth 
yolume, both published in New York City, gave a large amount of information on the 
   
-P-A-G-E-460

subjects indicated by their titles. Several of the missionary journals gave also some 
educational information. In place of the Industrial Monthly came America, also a 
monthly, New York City, devoted to the industry, trade, finance, and policy of the 
United States. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
According to the report of the regents of the University of the State of New York 
for 1879-80 (the latest at hand) there were 254 academies and academic departments of 
union schools subject to the visitation of the regents, and according to the State report 
for 1880-81 there were 31,114 pupils in these schools, for which the State appropriated 
$42,915. The scheme of the regents’ higher examinations for these secondary schools, 
as revised by the University Convocation of 1879, aims to adapt the examinations to the 
widely differing courses of study in these schools rather than compel the schools to 
conform their courses to an inflexible standard. An academic diploma is now granted 
to those students who have completed either an English or classical course; considerable 
freedom of choice as to the various studies is allowed, but common English branches are 
prescribed. To those who pass an examination in these prescribed branches, a certificate 
of progress is given, called the regents’ intermediate certificate. The other English 
branches of study are divided into 2 groups, and-any one having the intermediate cer- 
tificate who passes a satisfactory examination in any 4 studies of both groups is en- 
titled to receive the regents’ academic diploma. The classical series of examinations as 
a uniform basis of admission to the colleges of the State are substantially the same as 
adopted by the University Convocation of 1865. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory schools, and 
preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix, 
and for summaries of these, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN, FOR YOUNG WOMEN, OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The literary colleges recognized by the regents of the University of the State of New 
York, maintaining a separate collegiate existence and forming, with scientific, legal, 
and medical schools, also thus recognized, the University of the State, continued to be 
in 1880-’81, as in the previous year, in the order of their charters: (1) Columbia Col- 
lege, New York (Protestant Episcopal), 1754; (2) Union College, Schenectady (Union 
Church), 1795; (3) Hamilton College, Clinton (Presbyterian), 1812; (4) Hobart Col- 
lege, Geneva (Protestant Episcopal), 1824; (5) University of the City of New York, 
N. Y. (non-sectarian), 1831; (6) Madison University, Hamilton (Baptist), 1846; (7) St. 
John’s College, Fordham (Roman Catholic), 1846; (8) University of Rochester, Roches- 
ter (Baptist), 1846; (9) Elmira Female College, Elmira oe 1855; (10) St. 
Lawrence University, Canton (Universalist), 1856; (11) Alfred University, Alfred 
Seventh Day Baptist), 1857; (12) Ingham University, Le Roy (Presbyterian), 1857; 
13) St. Stephen’s College, Annandale (Protestant Episcopal), 1860; (14) College of St. 
Francis Xavier, New York (Roman Catholic), 1861; (15) Vassar College, Poughkeepsie 
non-sectarian), 1861; (16) Manhattan College, New York (Roman Catholic), 1863; (17) 
‘ornell University, Ithaca (non-sectarian), 1865; (18) College of the City of New 
York, N. Y. (non-sectarian), 1866; (19) Rutgers Female College, New York (non-sec- 
tarian), 1867; (20) Syracuse University, Syracuse (Methodist Episcopal), 1870; (21) 
Wells College, Aurora (Presbyterian), 1870; (22) St. Bonaventure’s College, Allegany 
(Roman Catholic), 1875. Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New 
York, mentioned with these in 1880, will be found among the scientific schools, further 
on. All the 22 report in some form for 1881, showing fair collegiate courses of 4 years, 
and all had, as preparatory schools, 2%4 recognized academies and academic depart- 
ments of union public schools; in 237 of these, at the date of the last report ot the 
regents, were 31,099 students, of whom 8,578 claimed to be academic and 8,356 had their 
claims allowed by the regents. In the 22 colleges at the same date there were 3,359 
students,’ under 346 instructors. In the whole course of their existence they had 
graduated from collegiate classes 13,106, including the graduates of 1880. Eleven of 
these colleges had philosophical or scientific courses; 5 had special courses, composed of 
studies in the regular course, but not leading to degrees; 5 had commercial courses of 1 
to 3 years; 10 gave instruction in drawing, painting, and music, these arts receiving ap- 
parently special attention at Wells, Elmira, Ingham, and Vassar (all for women), and 
at Syracuse University, where there was a special college of fine arts, with eminent in- 
    
1The number given appears to include preparatory as well as collegiate students.

  NEW YORK. 183 
structors, a full 4 years’ course, and a graduate course beyond it. To the Latin and 
Greek taught regularly in the classical courses of the 22 colleges, all added at least 2 
modern European languages, some having 3 or 4, and Cornell 5, while 6 included Anglo- 
Saxon and 6 Hebrew, Cornell and Columbia offering Sanscrit also. 
In addition to these colleges of the University come 7 under private or church control, 
noton the regents’ list, and with courses less definitely collegiate than the others. Of these 
‘7 the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute presents evidence of good work in 
its classical course, while in its scientific course it aims at especial thoroughness. Tho 
other 6—St. Francis and St. John’s Colleges, Brooklyn; Canisius and St. Joseph’s Col- 
leges, Buffalo: St. Louis College, New York, and the College and Seminary of Our 
Lady of Angels, Suspension Bridge—appear to have all remained still below the regents’ 
standard, though St. John’s, Canisius, and that at Suspension Bridge show an improve- 
ment since the last report: 
Two of the regents’ colleges, Elmira and Hobart, improved their buildings in 1880-’81; 
Columbia College extended its instruction in modern languages, and received (subject 
to a life interest of relatives of the testator) a bequest of $650,000 from the estate of the 
late Stephen Whitney Phenix, of New York, to promote scientific research; the Uni- 
versity of Rochester had its endowment fund increased by $256,800, Mr. John H. Deane, 
of New York, giving $100,000 of it and Mr. John B. Trevor, of New York, $50,000. 
St. Lawrence and Cornell Universities and Hamilton College also received gifts which 
brought the total of educational benefactions for the year in this State up to nearly 
$1,000, 000.— (Ninety-fourth report of regents, catalogues, and returns.) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Five of the collegiate schools above mentioned as under the general direction of the 
regents and forming parts of the University of the State are for young women: Elmira, 
Rutgers, Vassar, and Wells Colleges, and Ingham University, while Alfred, Cornell, St. 
Lawrence, and Syracuse Universities give women equal opportunities with young men. 
‘Twenty other schools that claim to be for the superior instruction of young women are 
on the lists of this Bureau and may be found in Table VIII of the appendix. Anexam- 
ination of their catalogues and circulars shows that comparatively few of them approach 
the standards of the 5 regents’ colleges for women. The Normal College of New York 
City, however, though its chief aim is to prepare young women from the city grammar 
schools to be teachers, carries its pupils through a 4 years’ course of training which for 
thoroughness and fulness may fairly be termed collegiate. In this college in 1881 were 
1,214students, with an average attendance of 1,127, under 37 instructors; in the 5 regents’ 
colleges for women there were, in the same year, 326 collegiate students, with 3 resident 
graduates, under 88 instructors; students in art and music, some probably counted twice, 
188. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The United States Military Academy, West Point, continued in 1880-’81 its single 
4 years’ course in literary, scientific, mathematical, legal, linguistic, and military studies, 
all directed to the preparation of skilled officers for the Army of the United States. 
Students for the year 230, under 50 instructors. 
‘The schools of science reported by the regents of the University in their ninety-fourth an- 
nual statement were the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy; Columbia College School 
of Mines, New York, and the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, also 
in New York. The Rensselaer Institute in 1880-81, as in several preceding years, con- 
centrated its entire work upon the preparation of civil engineers in a course covering 4 
years, offering, however, in its summer vacation, a 6 weeks’ course in assaying to its 
graduates and students and others qualified to take it—students, 104; instructors, 16. 
‘The Columbia College scientific work will be noticed further on. That of the Cooper 
Union included, besides 3 free schools of industrial art, a free school of telegraphy for 
women and a free night school of science, in which last instruction was given in mathe- 
matics, physics, engineering, astronomy, &c. The former school had 45 pupils in 1880- 
81; the latter, 1,335, of whom 390 received certificates of proficiency; instructors in the 
2 schools, 17.1 
Of the 22 literary colleges included in the ideal university of the State, 13 had in 
1881 scientific courses of 3 to 5 years. Elmira, Hamilton, Hobart, Vassar, and Union 
Colleges went beyond this by giving instruction in practical astronomy, with the aid of 
well equipped observatories, Union having also a course of 4 years in civil engineering, 
as had Syracuse University, while the University of the City of New York had a 3 years’ 
1 The whole number taught in the regular classes in the Union for 1880-81 was 3,018, and the 
capacity of the institution was enlarged in that year by the addition of another story to its height 
at a cost of $70,000 to Mr, Cooper, who added also $30,000 to its endowment fund,

course in the same. Columbia College, New York, and Cornell University, Ithaca, 
went still further, Columbia having a school of political science, with a 3 years’ course 
following the collegiate, and in its school of mines 5 parallel courses of 4 years in min- 
ing engineering, civil engineering, metallurgy, geology and paleontology, and chemistry 
(analytical and applied), beyond all which came graduate courses; while Cornell, in ad- 
dition to its regular 4 years’ courses in science, science and letters, and in philosophy, 
had a 2 years’ course in history and political science, with 4 years’ courses in agricult- 
ure, in mechanic arts, in military science, in architecture, in civil engineering, in math- 
ematics and astronomy, in chemistry and mineralogy, and in natural history. Its de- 
gree of civil engineer, moreover, was held so high that 5 years of study were necessary 
to obtain it, the 4 years’ course securing only that of bachelor of civil engineering; 
this was also the rule at Syracuse. At the University of the City of New York, the 
degree of civil engineer was given at the conclusion of its 3 years’ course; at Union 
College, the Rensselaer Institute, and the Columbia College School of Mines, at the con- 
clusion of their 4 years’ courses, Columbia, however, seeming to press its studies with a 
special thoroughness, which imposed 4he need of work in vacation as well as in the col- 
lege terms. 
A considerable amount of scientific study is presented in the ‘‘ special courses’? of 
the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, which has its point of summer study at 
Chautauqua, N. Y., and its centre of correspondence at Plainfield, N. J. This circle 
is fast approaching the proportions of a university in the variety of the courses it offers 
and the vast number of students under its direction. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction was given in 14 schools and departments reporting for 1880—’81. 
The following had 3 years’ courses of study and for admission required a collegiate 
course or its equivalent: Auburn Theological Seminary (Presbyterian); Hamilton The- 
ological Seminary (Baptist), which had a course for non-graduates also; General Theo- 
logical Seminary, New York City (Protestant Episcopal); Union Theological Seminary, 
New York City (Presbyterian), which also requires that the student shall complete the 
full course there or elsewhere; Rochester Theological Seminary (Baptist), including a 
German department; St. Andrew’s Divinity School, Syracuse (Protestant Episcopal) ; 
Theological Course of Alfred University (Seventh Day Baptist); Bonaventure College and 
Seminary, Allegany (Roman Catholic); the theological department of Hartwick Sem- 
inary (Lutheran); in the last 2 of these the 3 years’ course follows an academic course. 
Of the others Canton Theological School (Universalist) and the Seminary of Our Lady 
of Angels, Suspension Bridge (Roman Catholic), each had a 4 years’ course, including 
preparatory studies; while St. Joseph’s Provincial Seminary, Troy (Roman Catholic), 
had 43 to 5, also inclusive of preparatory studies. De Lancey Divinity School, Geneva 
(Protestant Episcopal), retains students until prepared for ordination, without regard to 
time; while the Christian Biblical Institute, Stanfordville (Christian), requires for ad- 
mission only a belief in the Bible as inspired and a common school education. New- 
burgh Theological Seminary (United Presbyterian) was suspended in 1878.— (Cata- 
logues and returns. ) 
In connection with the various other schemes of study organized at Chautauqua, a 
school of theology was instituted in 1881, with a course meant to cover 4 years, to be 
pursued privately by those that undertake it, but with regular presentation of papers 
and reports of progress to instructors; a B. D. diploma was promised on the completion 
of the course. 
For statistics of theological schools reporting, see Table XI of the appendix, and a 
summary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal.— Four law schools reported for 1880-81, as follows: The Albany Law School, , 
a department of the Union University, Albany, continued its 1 year course of 36 weeks. 
It had a faculty of 9 professors and 54 students. 
The law department of Hamilton College, Clinton, advanced its course of study from 
1 year for collegiate students and 1} for others, as heretofore reported, to a2 years’ course 
of 36 weeks each year for all. It had a faculty of 2 professors and 21 students. 
The Law School of Columbia College, New York City, had a course of 2 years, of 
about 31 weeks each. Graduates of Titerary colleges are admitted without examina- 
tion; others must be 18 years of age, must have received an academical training, in- 
cluding such a knowledge of Latin as is required for admission to the freshman class of 
the School of Arts. With a faculty of 6 professors there were 471 students, 254 of whom - 
had received a degree in letters or science; 120 graduated. Graduating its first class of 
men 1860 its alumni now number 2,470. The annual charge per scholar for tuition 
is $100. 
The Law School of the University of New York City reported a 2 years’ course of 32 
weeks each year, having apparently dropped its preparatory course since 1879. Its 
   
-P-A-G-E-463

faculty consisted of 6 professors, with an attendance of 70 students, of whom 37 gradu- 
ated.— (Catalogues and return.) 
For other statistics, see Table XII of the appendix, and a summary of it in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
Medical.—Kight regular, 3 eclectic, and 2 homeopathic schools of medicine report for 
1880-81. 
Of the regular schools, Long Island College Hospital, Brooklyn; the medical depart- 
ment of the University of Buffalo, at Buffalo, and the medical department of the Uni- 
versity of the City of New York required in 1881 only 3 years of study under a med- 
ical preceptor and attendance on ungraded lecture courses of 20 weeks a year. The Col- 
lege of Physicians and Surgeons connected with Columbia College, New York, uniting 
with these in the first requirements, called for 8 weeks more of lecture attendance each 
year, making 56 weeks of instruction in its 2years’ courseagainst 40 weeks in the others. 
It also, in common with the medical department of the City University, offered a 3 years’ 
graded course; both stimulated study with high prizes for successful work. Long Isl- 
and College Hospital offered, too, a 3 years’ graded course. The Woman’s Medical College 
of New York Infirmary, New York, and the College of Medicine of Syracuse Univer- 
sity, Syracuse, required instruction in regularly graded lecture courses of 3 years, which 
courses in the former were of 32 weeks each year and in the latter of 36.weeks; bothalso 
required of all candidates for admission without academic or collegiate diplomas a pre- 
liminary examination. Into the same class with these two, as respected. preliminary 
examination and required graded courses of 3 years, but not as respected length of each 
year’s course, came in 1880-81 Albany Medical College, Albany (a department of 
Union University, Schenectady), and Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York City, 
each with lecture courses of but 20 weeks a year. Bellevue, however, to the disap- 
pointment of the friends of higher training, the next year only offered a graded 3 years’ 
course without requiring it. 
Three eclectic medical schools continued their instructions, the College of Physicians 
and Surgeons, Buffalo, the Eclectic Medical College of the City of New York, and the 
United States Medical College, in the same city. The first two had only the minimum 
requirements of such schools, 3 years of study under a medical tutor and attendance on 
2 full lecture courses of 20 weeks each, with a thesis; the third added about 3 weeks to 
these requirements. 
The homeopathic colleges were 2, as before: the New York Homeopathic, apparently 
for men only, and the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women. The instruc- 
tion in both covered, as in previous years, a 3 years’ graded course of study, which in 
the former was required from 1880 and in the latter seems to have been so strongly 
urged as to be virtually the rule, though graduation after 2 full lecture courses was 
allowed on evidence of 3 years’ study. 
Dentistry.—The New York College of Dentistry, New York City, continued to receive 
and graduate students that had had 2 years of instruction from a preceptor or 2 in its 
owninfirmary courses (from March 1 to October 1 each year) and that had attended 2 
regular lecture sessions of 20 weeks each (October to March cach year), had deposited in 
its museum satisfactory specimens of dental work, and had passed creditably the ex- 
aminations of the professors of operative and mechanical dentistry. 
Pharmacy.—The College of Pharmacy of the City of New York, organized in 1829 and 
chartered in 1831, received in 1881 a coadjutor, the Albany College of Pharmacy, char- 
tered in that year. Both presented the usual requirements of such schools, 4 years of 
pharmaceutical experience and 2 years of study in their courses. : 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: 
EDUCATION FOR POLITICAL LIFE. 
Columbia College, New York City, and Cornell University, Ithaca, have responded to 
the pressing call for schools of political science, and have provided regular courses of 
study. Since 1880 there has been in the former a 3 years’ course following graduation 
from the usual college course; while in the latter the course in history and political sci- 
ence, which has existed for several years, has been greatly expanded and will eventually 
embrace all the important topics connected with political and social science.— (Register. ) 
TRAINING IN ART AND TRADES. 
The following collegiate institutions had departments of painting and drawing: Al- 
fred University, Wells College for Women, St. Francis and St. Joseph’s Colleges, and 
Rutgers Feniale College; while Elmira College, Ingham University, and Vassar College 
(all 3 for women) and the University and College of the City of New York had each a 
college of arts with courses of 2 to 3 years, and Syracuse University had a college of fine 
arts, with a 4 years’ course and one for graduates beyond it.— (Catalogues. )

  186 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
: 
The art school of the National Academy of Design continued to include instruction in 
the high arts.— (Present Age.) 
The technical school of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, classes its in- 
struction as follows: Moulding and carving, with a special class for artists and amateurs 
in cartoons for work in fresco, 5 nights aweek; drawing and designing in 2 classes, with 
courses of 2 and 3 nights a week; carriage drawing and construction, 3 nights a week, and, 
for women, day instruction in decoration in 2 classes, with courses of threeafternoonsa week. 
Lectures on subjects connected with the work are given on Saturday nights. Schools of 
wood and metal work were-to be added in 1881. Statistics of the year are wanting.— 
(Circular and Industrial News. ) 
The Society of Decorative Art, New York City, organized in 1878, provides a place for 
the exhibition and sale of women’s art work, induces women with talent for art work 
to culttvate it, aids their efforts by instruction, and procures orders for decorative pot- 
tery, porcelain, cabinet work, draperies, and embroidery. As the society limited itself to 
the higher order of work, a demand was soon felt for a similar institution filling a broader 
field. In May, 1878, the New York Exchange for Woman’s Work was opened, with the 
motto, ‘Anything a woman can do can be done at this exchange;”’ in 1881 it paid its 
consignors $23,743, retaining a commission of 10 per cent.— (Philadelphia Daily Evening

The technical art school at Cooper Institute, New York City, had departments of en- 
graving, wood carving, photography, and drawing in which free instruction was given. 
‘The success of the school is shown in the fact that a number of graduates of the normal 
drawing class were employed by jewellers, house decorators, lace makers, carpet manu- 
facturers, bookbinders, &c. In 1879-80 the photo-crayon class earned $5,755, with a 
much larger,earning in 1880-’81. The engraving class was constantly employed by 
Scribner, Harper Bros., the Smithonian Institution, &c. During 1880-’81 more than 
$20,000 were earned by the pupils in and out of the school, all going directly to them 
and none applied to the support of the institution.— (The Present Age.) 
The New York Trade Schools were established for the purpose of training efficient 
practical mechanics, experience having shown that a more thorough education can be 
given in a trade school than in a workshop. The courses of instruction, as drawn up 
with the advice of the proprietors of many leading houses in the city, are plumbing and 
sanitary engineering, house, sign, and decorative painting, with special courses in mix- 
ing colors, fresco painting, polishing, and repairing hard woods.— (Report. ) 
The Mosier Noonday Class, connected with the smith and machine department of 
Brewster & Co.’s carriage manufactory, New York City, began in September, 1881, and 
is conducted by J. L. H. Mosier, superintendent. The workmen devote a part of their 
nooning to reading technical books; writing, drawing, and book-keeping are studied at 
home. ‘This school is for apprentices only, and attendance on it is made a part of the 
contract in employing them. The experiment has proved a great success. 
The Ladies’ Art Association of New York and Brooklyn present courses in drawing and 
painting from life; drawing from cast; photograph coloring, water color and crayon; 
painting on china, enamel, and underglaze; principles of design; embroidery; botany; 
and geometry. Children’s classes were taught the rudiments of free hand and mechan- 
ical drawing, with use of brush, principles of form and color, and their application to man- 
ufactures.— (Circular. ) 
The Woman’s Institute of Technical Design, New York City, was opened by Mrs. L. E. 
Cory, November, 1881, with 5 students, and closed in the following June with 30. In- 
struction was given in wall papers, calico designs, and flower painting, and there was a 
carpet and oil cloth class. The results were encouraging, the designs for carpets made 
by the young women having been sold for reproduction in the factory.—(Woman’s 
Journal.) 
Art needlework was taught in all its varieties by the School for Art Needlework, in 
New York City. 
Fitch's Institute, Buffalo, endowed by Mr. Benjamin Fitch and intended to resemble 
Cooper Union, will include a female training school in connection with the Charity 
Organization Society of Buffalo; the institute received from Mr. Fitch property valued 
at $200,000.— (School Journal.) 
Household Art Rooms, Utica, is the name of an organization whose object is the pro- 
motion of mural decoration. To further this, the society made arrangements in 1881 
for a course of lectures in 1882 on the summer resorts of the ancient Romans, their 
daily life, their houses, and their mural decorations, in landscape, genre, and mythological 
_paintings.— (Household Art Rooms.) 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Kitchen Garden Association, New York City, is a school for teaching little girls, 
especially of poor parents, the various branches of household industry suggested by the

need of improving the ways of living among the poor and of discouraging the tendency 
among girls to look upon housework as debasing. Instruction is given in 6 lessons of 
1 month each in the details of domestic work, beginning with kindling fires, waiting on 
doors, bed making, sweeping, &c. ; laundry processes, scrubbing, and laying a dinner table 
in the order of its courses follow; then a lesson is given on the parts of beef, mutton, 
&e., and how to cook and carve each; lastly, children learn to knead bread, turn tiny 
rolls, cut out biscuit, and make pies. Appropriate songs attend all the lessons and make 
them attractive. Through an ingenious adaptation of the Kindergarten system, the chil- 
dren acquire the essential principles of good household service.— (Report. ) 
The Workingmen’s School of the Society for Ethical Culture, New York City, aims to 
combine industrial training with ordinary school work, and to use it not only for cre- 
ating mechanical skill, but also for educating the mind. Laying the foundation of its 
work in the Kindergarten, its effort is to carry it forward in graded courses of 2 years 
each, the work lessons being given in the last 2 hours of 2 days in each week. In the 
first 2 years, covering the period from 7 to 9 years of age, potter’s clay is used instead of 
wood, the school desks, with suitable tools, serving for work tables. At 9 years of age 
the plan is to begin work on wood with a small saw; at 11, to begin to handle the scroll 
saw, in wood first and afterwards in zinc; ayd at 13, to begin instruction in carpenter’s 
work with a complete outfit for a workshop. From the simplest household utensil the 
pupil is to go on to more difficult and extensive work, from which, after 2 years’ train- 
ing, he may advance to carving and turning. Up to the close of 1880-81, this experi- 
ment appears to have been a success, bringing a refreshing change into the school life 
of the children by its connection of industrial and literary training.— (Report of prin- 
cipal for 1880-’81.) 
The New York Cooking School, under the general management of Miss Juliet Corson, its 
secretary and superintendent; aims to teach the best methods of cheap and good cookery. 
The full course of instruction is given in twelve lessons, and embraces marketing, cook- 
ing, serving, and carving, with the chemistry of food and the physiology of nutrition. 
Economy is inculcated, and both housekeepers and cooks are required to learn by 
practice and comparison proper methods of bringing the best and cheapest dishes to a 
well appointed table. This school is now widely known as the pioneer of a movement 
that has reached nearly every city in the United States, and is redeeming American 
cookery from its wasteful methods and unwholesomeness. While the advantages of the 
school are not ignored by the rich, its benefits are chiefly enjoyed by the middle classes 
and the poor.— (Circular. ) 
Eleven mission institutions train large numbers of poor children at once in common 
school branches and in some useful industry, in 1881 giving training to 13,859, asfollows: 
The Brooklyn Industrial School Association and Home for Destitute Children, established in 
1854, attends to the ordinary education of its pupils, but gives especial prominence to the 
support of industrial schools, of which in 1881 it had 6 in different parts of the city; 5 
of these reported 875 pupils, the kitchen garden being used in 3 of them.— (Report. ) 
The Industrial School Association of Brooklyn, established in 1869, with work similar to 
the above, had under its care 276 children trained in school and domestic industries. 
The Brooklyn Children’s Aid Society divided its work into 6 departments, embracing 
industrial and sewing machine schools, with kitchen garden exercises. In.the sewing 
machine school 326 had received lessons. In the 2 industrial schools 703 were under 
instruction.— (Report. ) 
The Five Points House of Industry, New York City, taught 1,031 pupils in 1881, by 
whom 3,487 articles were made in the sewing department and 21,225 mended; 54 pupils 
learned to sew well, 10 to run the sewing machine; 11 worked by turns in the kitchen, 
34 in the bed rooms, while 30 were just learning to sew., In the type room, besiges 
doing the work on the Monthly Record, the boys did job work, earning between $500 and 
$600, ae some had gone out to earn their living in printing establishments.— (Monthly 
Record. 
The Industrial Schools of the Children’s Aid Society, New York City, in 1880-’81 had 21 
day and 11 night schools, enrolling 9,662. During the last 12 years 113,000 poor children 
had been prepared for servants, apprentices, clerks, factory hands, and artists, 10,500 
were sent to the public schools, 2,800 truants were brought in, and 7,500 were sent to 
places of employment. Since its organization it had trained from the poor and vagrant 
children about 60,000 for useful work and found places for them, had sheltered 200,000 
in its lodging houses, and had taught over 50,000 poor little girls in the 21 industrial 
schools; of these not a score had entered on a criminal life or had become drunkards or 
beggars, though four-fifths were the children of criminal or vicious parents.— (Report. ) 
The Industrial Department of the Young Woman’s Christian Association, New York 
City, in 1881, secured positions for nearly 1,200 women; gave to 114 the making of over 
2,000 garments, paying them good prices; trained 62 girls to become competent seam- 
- stresses; and assisted 335 young women in getting safe homes and 225 women in secur- 
ing boarders,

188 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The New York House and School of Industry gives sewing work to poor women and 
trains young girls to various industries. Of these 40 have become skilled seamstresses 
and readily found employment. In housework 12,516 garments had been made, em- 
ploying 180 destitute women. In the industrial school there were 199 children. 
The Wilson Industrial School for Girls, New York City, sustained a day school where 
girls were instructed in the common English branches and sewing by hand and making 
their own garments, which, by a system of credit, they earn. There were 310 on the 
roll.— (Annual report.) 
The Industrial School of Rochester, occupying in its twenty- -fifth year an enlarged build- 
ing free from debt, received 121 poor children during 1881, and had 83 in average attend- 
ance in the day school. The kitchen garden was used in domestic training, and cookery 
classes were in successful operation.— (Report. ) 
The House of the Good Shepherd, a home in Rockland County for orphan and destitute 
children, endeavors to train poor children for farm work, trades, and industries suitable 
for girls, and to educate deserving and earnest minded youth who wish to work their 
own way and elevate their position. Every one able is obliged to work. There were 52 
inmates during the year 1881.— (Report. ) 
The Children’s Friend Society, Albany, aims to provide an ordinary school for the poor 
children it gathers in, and also to train them in important branches of housework and 
sewing. In 1879, the last year for which there is a report, there were 242 children in 
attendance.— (Report. 
TRAINING OF NURSES. 
The training schools for nurses reporting in 1880-’81 are the Brooklyn Training 
School, opened in 1880, which had 12 pupils in its 2 years’ full course; the New York 
State School for Training Nurses, organized 1870, which in 1881 had 6 instructors and 7 
pupils; the Buffalo General Hospital Training School, organized in 1878, which had 
trained in its 2 years’ full course 33 and graduated 5; the Charity Hospital Training 
School, which had instructed in its 2 years’ course 130, enrolling 40 and graduating 6 in 
1881, and of whose 90 graduates during its existence of 6 years 75 were known to continue 
in the profession; the Mt. Sinai Training School, New York City, had 26 pupils in its 2 
years’ course; the New York Hospital Training School had instructed in all 70 in its 
course of a year and a half, and 26 during the year, graduating 12; and the New York 
Training School for Nurses in the Bellevue Hospital had trained 148 in its full 2 years’ 
courses since 1873 and 64 during the year. Of the 148 graduates, 120 were known to 
continue in the work; and the House and Hospital of the Good Shepherd, Syracuse, re- 
ported nurse training work in 1879-’80. All required, for admission, a common school 
education, good moral character, firm health, and ages between 20 and 36. 
EDUCATION IN MUSIC. 
The New York College of Music, incorporated in 1878, arranges its course of instruc- 
tion in departments of vocal sight-reading; piano; violin; theory and harmony; vocal; 
and organ; besides chamber music and operatic departments for advanced students in 
piano playing and vocal training; all under 16 professors, with 854 students, in 1881-82. 
Diplomas in art and degrees in musical science are conferred by the president and cor- 
poration, on the recommendation of the director and faculty and under the authority of 
the State of New York.— (New York College of Music.) 
The Baxter University of Music, Friendship, was reported in 1881 as a fully organized 
institution in every branch of musical learning; there were graduating courses for church, 
Society, orchestral, and band musicians, with lectures and a series of concerts accom- 
panying the courses. No statistics are given.— (Report. ) 
Ld SCHOOLS FOR TRAINING IN ORATORY.    
Several schools of this kind are known to exist in the city of New York, but no infor- 
mation concerning them for 1880-81 has heen received. 
TRAINING IN SEAMANSHIP. 
The Nautical School of the Port of New po on the school ship St. Mary, is for the 
training of pupils in the elements of an ordinary school course, with instruction in the 
science and art of navigation. The sea service and school training occupy each about 
halfa year. The enrolment for 1881 was 107. The boys were examined in the spring 
in school studies under the superintendence department of the city schools; in October, 
in the presence of 15 shipmasters, they were successfully put through their drill in sea- 
manship; 47 were graduated.— (State and city reports. ) 
  EDUCATION OF THE DEAF 
  AND DUMB. 
In the 6 State institutions for this purpose there were 1,323 pupils in 1880-81, a de- 
crease of 12 from the previous year. Of these, 649 were State pupils and 455 county, while  
-P-A-G-E-467
    
NEW YORK. 189 
128 were supported by the State of New Jersey and 91 by parents, guardians, or friends. 
Of the whole number the New York Institute for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, 
New York City, had 519; the New York Institution for the Improved Instruction of 
Deaf-Mutes, 137; the St. Joseph Institute for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, 
Fordham, 239; the Central New York Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Rome, 168; the West- 
ern New York Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Rochester, 132; Le Couteulx St. Mary’s In- 
stitute for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, Buffalo, 128. Increased importance 
was attached to the industrial departments in most of these schools, as through them 
both males and females, when leaving school, may have some means of self support be- 
sides the mental training. From year to year, instruction in the arts of design was be- 
coming more and more important, developing taste and skill which were highly gratify- 
ing. A number of recent graduates, both male and female, were devoting themselves to 
artistic work as a specialty with pecuniary success. Articulation and lip reading re- 
ceived more or less attention in all the schools, but more especially in the 2 institutions 
in New York City, where, under the most approved methods, the results were very en- 
couraging. One graduate passed a successful examination for admission to the Columbia 
College School of Mines, and was successfully pursuing the course in civil engineering, 
depending entirely on lip reading. The institution at Rochester had introduced the 
Kindergarten teaching with increased usefulness, as by experience it was found to be 
of great value in the instruction of deaf-mute children. During the year printing was 
added to the trades taught, and a daily paper was issued, made up of items from the school 
exercises, with little incidents of school life and bits of news from the daily papers, using 
the simplest language possible, the difficulty in finding books simple enough for the young 
children having led to the idea of this paper. This institution had, for the three previous 
years, occupied rented property belonging to the city, but in 1881 the city had executed 
a lease giving to the institution the property, valued at $81,000, for 25 years at $1 per 
annum, During theyear the New York Institution No. 2 removed from its old location 
on Broadway to its beautiful home on Lexington avenue. It is said that there is no 
finer structure for deaf-mutes in the world. The ground was given by the city on a 99 
years’ lease at $1 per annum, the building costing $140,000.— (State report.) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The New York State Institution for the Blind, Batavia, registered 170 pupils during 
1880-81, boys 86, girls 84, and was arranged in 3 departments, literary, musical, and 
industrial. In the literary, besides the ordinary English branches, instruction was given. 
in rhetoric, zodlogy, physiology, natural and moral philosophy, with exercises in decla- 
mation and composition. +» The Kindergarten class was continued with increasing interest 
and success. In the musical department 120 were instructed in instrumental music, 10 
of these upon the pipe organ. An orchestra of 8 instruments was taught through the 
year, while a class of 14 were instructed in harmony and musical composition, some of 
whom were subsequently employed in teaching. The tuning class of 18 had made good. 
progress and were tuning their own instruments. In the industrial department broom 
making was the principal industry for the males, while the females were taught hand 
and machine sewing, knitting, and ornamental needlework.— (Report. ) 
The New York Institution for the Blind, New York City, had 236 inmates in 1880-’81. 
It arranged its system of instruction in 3 departments, literary, musical, and industrial: 
the literary embraces a course of studies of 7 grades, going as high as algebra, geometry, 
logic, mental, moral, and natural philosophy, science of government, rhetoric, and com- 
position; in the musical department instruction is given in voice culture, chorus sing- 
ing, piano and organ playing, theory and practice of teaching, staff and Wait systems of 
musical notation, and piano tuning. In the industries the males are taught cane seating, 
mattress making, and the manipulations of piano action and strings necessary in piano 
tuning.— (Report. ) 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The New York Asylum for Idiots, Syracuse, established in 1851, has made no report 
of its work for 1880-81 to this Bureau. In 1879-’80 it had an average of 289 under 
instruction in simple elementary studies and industrial occupations. 
REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS. 
The State reformatories are the New York House of Refuge, Randall’s Island, and 
the Western House of Refuge, Rochester, each with educational and industrial depart- 
ments for both sexes, the State being districted between them. During the last year 
the former had an average attendance of 741 and had cared for 19,969 inmates since 1825. 
Statistics for 1881 are wanting for the latter school. 
In addition to these there were kindred institutions under the care of benevolent organ- 
izations, viz: (1) The State Reformatory, Elmira, which had received 1,238 during five 
years up to September, 1881; (2) the New York Catholic’ Protectory, Westchester 
   
-P-A-G-E-468
    
190 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
County, which had 2,833 under its care in 1880-’81; of these, 795 left during the year 
physically and morally improved and more than 500 of them fitted to earn their own 
living; a large proportion of the boys were placed on farms in Nebraska. (3) The 
Catholic Protectory, Buffalo, mentioned in the report of board of charities as among the 
most important in the State, furnishes the Bureau no information since 1876. The fol- 
lowing provide only for girls and, though reformatory in character, the inmates are not 
committed: the Association for Befriending Children and Young Girls, the New York 
Magdalen Benevolent Society, both in New York City, the latter caring for 166 in 1881, 
and the House of Shelter, Albany, with no statistics. 
The great number of children brought under these reformatories and the,large annual 
expenditures for their support place them among the most important publie charities in 
the State. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
UNIVERSITY CONVOCATION. 
The regents of the University of the State of New York have held, under this title, 
since 1863, an annual meeting with the instructors of the various colleges, normal schools, 
and academic institutions under their direction, uniting with these, since 1868, the 
trustees of such institutions. Its annual session at Albany July, 1881, is reported to 
have been unusually interesting. The most marked feature of the meeting was a paper 
on the relation of the General Government to the education of the people, the conclusion 
being that Congress should appropriate a fund in aid of education and determine all con- 
ditions of its apportionment; that after such apportionments have been made by Congress 
and accepted by the States they should be entirely controlled and administered by the 
States. The meagre report at hand from a State newspaper mentions only the reading 
of other papers on education, on chairs of pedagogy in colleges, and a few more the titles 
of which are not given. Dr. David Murray, who had been appointed secretary of the 
board at a meeting in January, was said to be showing a vigorous and progressive spirit, 
which, witha genial manner, gave promise that the convocations of the future would be 
more successful than those of the past. It was thought that the time of the convocation 
should be changed from July to January, in the hope of calling out a larger and more 
representative attendance. Hon. Henry R. Pierson was elected chancellor.— (School 
Bulletin.) : 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-sixth anniversary of the New York State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Saratoga July 5-7, 1881, and was called to order by the president, Prof. Jerome Allen. 
The meeting was characterized by certain indications of progress: the attendance of 
teachers and leading educators was large and the interest shown encouraging; the mem- 
bership was greatly increased; the drift of sentiment in addresses and papers read was 
toward improvements in theories and practice; the subjects introduced and discussed 
were those most directly touching the issues of the day in educational matters. The 
president gave the keynote to the spirit of the session, saying: ‘‘ All over the land new 
methods of education are being talked about. Our meetings should state the diagnosis 
of the diseases in our schools and point distinctly to the remedies. It is far more im- 
portant to reduce our illiteracy than to lessen our public debt. The education needed 
as a remedy must be supplemented by religious or atleast moral training. Our mistake 
has been that in running away from sectarianism we have run away from religion as well. 
If the State is bound to prevent children from growing up in ignorance, she is equally 
bound to prevent them from growing up in idleness or vice. Why should the State wait 
until an aimless life has blasted character and influence before it does what it ought 
earlier to have done?’’ Aftemthis address, which was listened to with great interest, 
came reports of committees on ‘The condition of education,” ‘ Improv red methods of 
education,’ ‘‘The advancement of education,’? and ‘‘ Nearsightedness in schools.’ 
Besides these there were elaborate papers on ‘‘Reading,”’ on ‘‘ Institutes and institute 
instruction,” ‘‘ Recent criticisms on our public schools,’’ “ Latin in high schools,”’ 
= Genealogy of the modern lecture and its place in educational agencies,’’ “ Educational 
journalism, ”’ followed by remarks on ‘‘ Industrial education in the public schools.’? The 
exercises were enlivened by recitations, music, and an excursion to Lake George, when, 
after the appointment of officers for the ensuing year, the association adjourned to meet 
at Yonkers in 1882.— (Annual report.) 
ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COMMISSIONERS AND CITY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
At the last meeting of this association, at Utica, December, 1880, it was voted to hold 
its next session in January, 1882, in order that the persons elected school commissioners 
at the general election of 1881 might act officially in the proceedings, their terms begin- 
ning ra the first day of January, 1882. Reports of this meeting are wanting.— (State

OBITUARY RECORD. 
SUPERINTENDENT SAMUEL S. RANDALL. 
Born in 1809, at Norwigh, N. Y., and dying in the city of New York, June 3, 1881, Mr. 
Randall filled much of his seventy-two years of life with useful labor for the educational 
interests of his native State and of its chief city. Having supplemented early school 
studies with a brief course at Hamilton College, he prepared for the bar in the office of 
Hon. Daniel S. Dickinson, and was admitted to practice in 1834. Gen. John A. Dix 
was at that time secretary of state and superintendent of public instruction, and for the 
management of the latter interest secured the aid of Mr. Randall before he had gone far 
into the practice of the law. The young assistant proved to be the man for the place 
and the occasion, doing his work so well that he was retained till the close of General 
Dix’s long incumbency, and then was reéngaged for,the same duties by Hon. John C. 
Spencer, who in 1839 succeeded General Dix. Two years later, 1841, his valuable services 
received honorable recognition in his appointment to the deputy superintendency, an 
office apparently created for him, and which he held till 1846, again from 1849 to 1852, 
and once more for a part of 1854, While acting thus as deputy, the ful duties of the 
superintendency twice devolved upon him, and were performed so satisfactorily that 
when, in 1853, a movement was begun to separate the department of public education 
from the office of the secretary of state, it was generally supposed that Mr. Randall’s 
faithful work and intimate acquaintance with the State school system (which he had 
done much te improve) would lead to his election to the superintendency. Political 
influences stood in his way, however, then; but two months later (in June, 1854) he was 
/elected to the superintendency of schools in New York City. He accepted the position, 
and held it for 16 years, bringing up the city system, then in its infancy. Resigning on 
account of failing health, his deputy, Mr. Henry Kiddle, succeeded him, and he gave 
much of his remaining strength to the preparation of an excellent History of the Com- 
mon School System of the State, published in 1871. For the preparation of this history 
he was fitted, not only by his personal acquaintance with the system and by careful 
study of the State records at Albany, but also by two preceding works, A Digest of the 
Common School System, published in 1844, and The Common School System of the 
State of New York, published in 1851, with a smaller one on Mental and Moral Culture, 
1844. To all these are to be added a History of the State of New York, for the use of 
schools, published in 1870, and First Principles of Popular Education and Popular 
Instruction, 1868, with 15 valuable reports on the school system of New York City. 
Full of years and worn with labors, he at last rested, honored with the title of ‘father 
of the school system of New York,’’ which system he certainly did more than almost any 
other single man to put into efficient operation. 
ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT ALEXANDER J. SCHEM. 
Professor Schem was born in Westphalia, Prussia, in 1826; entered, 1843, the University 
of Bonn; completed his university studies at Tiibingen, and came in 1851 to America. 
Here he taught modern languages at Mount Holly, N. J., and in 1854 became professor 
of Hebrew and modern languages in Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa., where he con- 
tinued forsome years. The intelligence displayed here in his contributions to the news- 
papers attracted the attention of the literary men engaged on Appleton’s Cyclopedia, 
and he was invited to New York to aid them. Continuing in this work for eleven years, 
he established such a reputation for varied scholarship that when Johnson’s Cyclopedia 
was planned he was employed on this also. In 1874 he became one of the assistant 
superintendents of the public schools of New York City, under Henry Kiddle, continuing 
such until his death. During this‘period he united with Mr. Kiddle in preparing a very 
useful Cyclopedia of Education, published by Steiger in 1877, and then, with others, 
was engaged on the Theological Encyclopedia of Drs. McClintock and Strong. These 
are but specimens of the literary labors that he undertook in connection with his school 
duties. ‘The multitude of these labors, however, told upon his system, and led to his 
premature death, which occurred May 21, 1881. 
BISHOP ERASTUS 0. HAVEN, D.D., LL. D. 
This accomplished man, whose life was marked by a succession of honors, was born in 
Boston, Mass., November 1, 1820; he graduated at Wesleyan University, 1842; was prin- 
cipal of a private academy at Sudbury, Mass., during 1842-’43; then taught in Amenia 
Seminary, N. Y., till 1848; served the next five years as pastor of important Methodist 
churches in New York City and vicinity, and from 1853 to 1856 was professor, first of 
Latin, then of rhetoric and English literature, at the University of Michigan, Ann 
Arbor, during which time Union College, N. Y., conferred on him the degree of D. D. 
In 1856 he was induced to return to Boston as editor of Zion’s Herald, the chief Metho- 
dist paper of New England. Here again his ability and scholarship were recognized by

was chosen chairman) and by the people in two successive elections to the State senate ; 
while from Ohio Wesleyan University came like recognition in an honorary degree of 
LL. D. After seven years’ work in Boston he was recalled in 1863 to the University of 
Michigan to take the place of the retiring chancellor, Rev. Dr. Henry P. Tappan. His 
excellent administration here doubled in six years the funds and the attendance, with 
such improvement in literary quality and discipline as to place the institution in the 
front rank of the institutions of its class in the United States. This work accomplished, 
he felt at liberty to undertake a like one for an infant university of his own church, the 
Northwestern, at Evanston, Ill., not far from Chicago. He went there as president in 
1869; ‘‘ found it,” says a later president, ‘‘a small college; made it a university in fact 
as well as name.’’ Such successful college work led to the selection of him by his church 
as secretary of its board of education in 1872, and to his election as chancellor of one of 
its most important institutions, Syracuse University, Syracuse, N. Y. He accepted both 
positions, carrying into the latter the work of the former, without compensation, and, 
although burdened with this extra labor, he added largely to the attendance on the 
university, strengthened its courses, brought its medical school up to the standard of 
the highest in the country, and much improved its college of fine arts. In 1880 he was 
elevated by his church to its highest office of bishop, and was assigned the Pacific coast 
as his field of labor. Beginning that labor at San Francisco and along the coast from _ 
January, 1881, within six months he was prostrated with malarial fever in Oregon, and 
died August 3, 1881, leaving the reputation of a model educator and a most genial, 
lovable, and many-sided man. 
GEORGE PAYNE QUACKENBOS, LL.D. 
Born in New York City, September 4, 1826, and graduated at Columbia College in 1843, 
Dr. Quackenbos spent a year in teaching at the South, and then, returning to his native 
city, became principal of the Henry Street Grammar School, subsequently occupying 
for twenty years the same relation to a ‘‘ collegiate school”’ at the corner of Fourteenth 
street and Sixth avenue. To this long experience in teaching we owe a series of 
text books for school use that have made his name familiar not only throughout the 
United States, but in England and its colonies, and even in Japan. First Lessons in 
English Composition came out in 1851; Advanced Course of Composition and Rhetoric 
and a School History of the United States, in 1854; a Natural Philosophy, in 1859; 
English Grammar, in 1862; a Primary Arithmetic and an Elementary Arithmetic, in 
1863; a Practical Arithmetic and an Elementary History of the United States, in 1868, 
with a larger History of the United States, in 1876; besides all which he edited a revised 
edition of Spiers and Surenne’s French and English Dictionary. These books secured 
so Wide a welcome that teaching had at last to be relinquished and his whole time given 
to the revision and improvement of the volumes that were aiding others in their school 
work. In this congenial occupation some pencetat and useful years were passed; he died 
July 24, 1881, at New London, N. H. 
DR. JAMES P. WHITE. 
This esteemed physician and instructor, born in Livingston County, N. Y., March 14, 
1811, died September 28, 1881. A practitioner of great intelligence and a student in 
European schools, as well as in America, he early rose to eminence in his profession, 
became one of the chief agents in the establishment of the Medical Department of the 
University of Buffalo, was a professor in it from the outset, had been its president for 
some time before his death, and was also first vice president of the American Medical 
Association.

  194 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
  A State board of education and a State superintendent of public instruction (who is ex 
officio a member of the board) have general charge of educational interests. County 
school affairs are supervised by county boards of education composed of the commission- 
ers of each county assisted by county superintendents. These last were provided for in 
' 1881, the office of county examiner being at the same time abolished. County superin- 
tendents are elected biennially by county boards of education and of magistrates in joint 
session. For each district, a school committee of three persons is elected by the county 
board of education. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Under the constitution the public schools have long been supported by the income of 
a State school fund, by county school funds, and by State and county capitation taxes, 
the sum of the last two not to exceed $2 a head. Undertheschool law of 1881 there are 
also given to the schools a general tax of 12} cents on the $100 of property and credits in 
the State and a poll tax of 37} cents. If these funds should not be sufficient to maintain 
schools four months in each school year, under the new school law a special tax for the 
amount necessary must be levied by the county commissioners. School funds are appor- 
tioned by the State board to counties, and by county boards to the several districts,! accord- 
ing to the number of children therein between 6 and 21, the county boards specifying how 
much is for white and how much for colored schools. The district school committees are 
required each year to take a census of youth of school age, designating race and sex, and 
forward their enumerations to the county superintendent. The funds and schools for 
white and colored children must be keptseparate. Schools aided by public funds are free 
to all residents of the district 6 to 21. Teachers are examined by county superintend- 
ents, from whom they receive certificates valid for 1 year in the county where issued and. 
graded according to qualification. Institutes may be organized by county boards of edu- 
cation, who are authorized to appropriate annually $100 of county school funds for the 
purpose; and when such institutes are held teachers are required to attend. Teachers 
must make report at the close of every term to the county superintendent and the district 
school committee; county superintendents, pay: to the State superintendent, and he 
to the governor.— (School laws, 1881.) . 
GENERAL CONDITION, 
With an increase of 8,748 youth of school age, the enrolment reported was 15,110 
higher. To sustzin the public schools there seem to have been raised $137,197 more than 
in 1879-80, and there was a reported addition of $40,881 to the value of State school 
property. Information from other than ofiicial sources indicates that several religious 
associations in other States did much to improve the teaching force in North Carolina by 
providing normal schools, more or less permanent in character, which seem to have been 
well attended; in two or three instances enterprising towns secured teachers, set up 
graded schools, and carried them on with enthusiasm. The figures, however, do not on 
the whole indicate progress; for, while the want of uniformity in the returns for the two 
years unavoidably vitiates to some extent comparisons which.might otherwise be safely 
instituted, it is clear that there was a large falling off in the average attendance, espe- 
cially of white pupils, and there is an evident incongruity in the increase of 872 teachers 
reported and the decrease of 55 in the number of school-houses occupied. 
The State superintendent recommends that the school system as organized under the 
law of 1881 be continued for the present, and hopes much from the county superintend- 
ency and the arrangements for improving teachers that have been recently introduced. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
  Several Kindergiirten: reported statistics for 1879-80, but only one sent a report of 
statistics for 1880-’81. The school connected with Charlotte Female Institute, Char- 
lotte, had 9 pupils under Kindergarten training. A Kindergarten department was a@ 
feature of the Franklin Normal School in 1881, while the absence of such a department 
from the university normal course was a marked change from former sessions. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
LEGAL PROVISIONS. 
In townships of 5,000 inhabitants and upward (with two or three exceptions), a tax 
for the support of graded schools was authorized in 1877; but it could not exceed one- 
tenth of 1 per cent. on property and 30 cents on the poll.   
1 According to the new law, all the school funds thus assigned to a district may be used to build school-houses, if the school committee so determine. Under this law 38 new ones are said to have been built in one county.

STATISTICS OF RALEIGH. 
Only two cities in this State, Raleigh and Wilmington, had in 1880-81 over 7,500 
inhabitants, the minimum limit of those cities from which statistics are given in Table 
II of the appendix. 
Raleigh, with a population of 9,265 and 4,388 youth of school age (1,960 whites and 
2,428 colored), reports an enrolment in public schools of 1,778 (650 whites and 1,128 
colored). About 200 white and 50 colored children were enrolled in private and parochial 
schools. Public schools were taught 196 days by 23 teachers, of whom 6 were men. 
‘The property used for school purposes was valued at $5,000.— (Return. ) 
Wilmington had 17,350 inhabitants according to the census of 1880, but no report of 
its public schools has been received since 1879. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Ten schools called State normal schools appear in the State report as held in some part 
of 1881 with a total attendance of 1,363 pupils, of whom 1,138 were engaged in profes- 
sional studies and 225 were in preparatory or practice schools. Five of these schools 
were summer normals, holding sessions of 4 or 6 weeks during the vacations of the public 
schools. One-half of the schools were for colored pupils. 
The North Carolina University Normal School, Chapel Hill, established by the State in 
1877, held, as usual, a six weeks’ session in the university buildings during vacation, 
338 pupils being enrolled under 18 instructors and 11 lecturers. Instruction inelocution 
was a novel feature of the work. Tuition was free. The State appropriation for the 
year was $2,000. ‘ 
The State Colored Normal School, Fayetteville, also organized in 1877, enrolled 63 pre- 
paratory and 46 normal pupils under 3 instructors, and now presents a 3 years’ course 
of study, one year having been added during 1880-’81 in consequence of a demand for 
colored teachers of a higher grade. Certificates of competency to’ teach, however, are 
still given to students who complete the junior year. Tuition is free. The State appro- 
priates $2,000 a year to the school. Up to 1881 $500 had been received from the Pea- 
body fund, but in that year this was reduced to $205, owing to the establishment of 
various other normals which needed assistance. 
‘Franklin Normal School, Franklin, established by the State board in 1881, is a sum- 
mer normal of 4 weeks, giving free tuition and receiving aid from the State, the county, 
and the Peabody fund. ‘There were 127 normal students enrolled under 4 teachers and 
3 lecturers, besides 52 in a model school. : 
Elizabeth City State Normal, Elizabeth City, a 6 weeks’ school, established in 1881, re- 
ports $500 received from the State, tuition free, and 64 students attending. 
Newton State Normal School, Newton, established by the State in 1881, is a summer 
vacation school of 5 weeks, held in the buildings of the Catawba High School. It 
received from the State an appropriation of $500,-and had, according to the State report, 
127 normal students, besides 80 children in a Kindergarten, both under 9 resident in- 
structors and 8 others. 
Wilson State Normal School, Wilson, a summer normal of 5 weeks, organized in 1881, 
received $500 from the State, $100 from the county, and $200 from the Peabody fund; it 
enrolled 154 pupils, under 10 instructors and 9 lecturers. 
New Berne State Normal School (for colored students), established in 1881, in a course 
extending over 3 years of 21 weeks each, aims to give a first class training to those ex- 
pecting to teach. There were 63 students enrolled during the year under 3 instructors 
and 2 lecturers. Tuition was free.— (Return. ) ‘ 
Besides this at New Berne, 3 other normal schools for the colored race were established. 
in 1881: one at Franklinton, with 4 teachers and 65 pupils; another at Plymouth, with 
3 teachers and 91 pupils; and a third at Salisbury, with 2 teachers and 63 pupils. 
  OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Graham Normal College, Graham (organized as such in 1881), has preparatory and nor- 
mal departments of study, the latter with junior and senior classes. Instructors, 4; 
students not given. 
Whitin Normat School, Lumberton, organized in 1876, aims to prepare pupils for gov- 
erning and teaching the public schools for colored pupils in a course of study extending 
through 4 years of 6 months each, the sessions being held in the summer to allow pupils 
to teach at other seasons. There were 30 normal and 53 other pupils during 1880-’81, 
under a principal and 4 pupil teachers. 
Wilmington Normal School, Wilmington, organized in 1865 by the American Mission- 
ary Association, had 236 pupils enrolled during the year under 6 instructors. 
Lileston Normal School, Wilmington, opened in 1872 and sustained by the American

    196 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Unitarian Association and Soldiers’ Memorial Society, graduated 7 pupils during 
1880-81. Further statistics are not given.— (The Lighthouse. ) 
The State University, Chapel Hill, instituted in 1881 a teachers’ course of 2 years, em- 
bracing all the studies required by law to be taught in the public schools, with some 
higher ones and theory of teaching. 
The Normal Department of Shaw University, Raleigh, organized in 1866, reports a 3 
years’ course of study, with 211 students during the year, under 9 instructors. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Under the new school law, above referred to, the board of education in any county 
may appropriate any sum not over $100 out of the school funds for one or more teachers’ 
institutes in their county, or the county commissioners of two or more adjoining coun- 
ties may appropriate a like amount for a joint institute. In case such institute is pro- 
vided for and announced the public school teachers of the county or counties thus acting. 
are required to attend the institute, though there appears to be no penalty for non- 
compliance with this rule. Thirty-three such institutes for white and 11 for colored 
teachers are reported by the State superintendent to have been held in 22 counties, with 
an attendance of 703 whites and 169 colored. Two counties had each 2 institutes 
for whites; one had 3; another 4, and one (Henderson) had 5 within the year. 
J EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The North Carolina Educational Journal, the official organ of the State Teachers’ 
Association, a monthly published at Chapel Hill, Rev. J. F. Heitman, editor, issued its 
first number January 15, 1881. It is intended to be a medium of communication and a 
vehicle of information for the teachers of the State and for others engaged in the work 
of education. 
The Lighthouse and Tileston Recorder, a monthly published at Wilmington by the 
Tileston Normal School, although principally devoted to the interests of the Tileston 
Normal School in that place, contains some general educational information and much to 
aid teachers in improving their methods of discipline and instruction. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
No information has reached this Office as to the number of high schools in the State 
or of pupils attending on them. The North Carolina Educational Journal mentions 
the graded schools of Salisbury, Fayetteville, Raleigh, Wilson, and Goldsboro’, and 
notices the sessions of Clinton, Cary, Webster, Franklin, and Waynesville high schools, 
but does not indicate whether these last are under public or private control and does 
not give statistics of attendance. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private secondary schools, such as business colleges, academies, and 
preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix, and 
for a summary of them, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
fe SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, for young men only, offers classical, 
scientific, and philosophical undergraduate courses and graduate instruction leading to 
the degrees. of PH. D., M. A., and M. S.; also, courses in music, law, and medicine. 
The president’s report for 1880-81 shows that the university was in excellent condition. 
The number of students attending and the receipts for tuition had increased, additional 
work had been done in the higher departments of chemistry, and students in natural 
history were required to do laboratory work. New apparatus had been bought for the 
departments of physics, chemistry, and natural history, and an annual appropriation 
was made by the trustees for the increase of the university library. General good order 
prevailed among students; very little hazing was done, and its complete disappearance 
was confidently expected.— (North Carolina Educational Journal.) 
Of 8 other universities and colleges, all but 3 are exclusively for men; Rutherford 
College, Rutherford; Weaverville College, Weaverville (both non-sectarian), and Shaw 
University, Raleigh (Baptist), admit both sexes. Three of the 9 (the State University, 
Rutherford College, Rutherford, and Weaverville College, Weaverville) are non-sec- 
tarian in influence, 2 (Biddle University, Charlotte, and Davidson College, Davidson) 
are under the care of Presbyterians, and 2 others (Shaw University, Raleigh, and Wake 
Forest College, Wake Forest) under that of the Baptist Church, while the Evangel-
-P-A-G-E-475
  NORTH CAROLINA. 197 
ical Lutherans control North Carolina College, Mt. Pleasant, and the Methodist Episco- 
pal Church South controls Trinity College, Trinity. All, at date of last report, provided 
preparatory departments; all presented the ordinary classical collegiate course of 4 
years orits equivalent, although in 3 the arrangement was that of independent schools. 
All buttwo added scientific courses, generally of 4 years; 3 had commercial or business 
courses, 3 musical, and 2 normal. Six gave instruction in French, 6 in German, 2 in 
Hebrew, 4 in theology, 3 in law, and 2 in medicine.— (Catalogues and returns. ) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
Of 8 or more colleges and seminaries for young women, half of them at least being au- 
thorized by law to confer collegiate degrees, 4 report statistics for 1880-’81. These had 
a total of 382 pupils enrolled, of whom 256 were in collegiate classes. Music, French, ' 
German, drawing, and painting form a part of the course of study in nearly all these 
schools. For statistics of those reporting,see Table VIII of the appendix, and for a 
summary of their statistics, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. ‘ 
\ SCIENTIFIC. 
In the scientific course of the State University are grouped studies that relate especially 
to the practical pursuits of life, including agriculture, surveying, and engineering. The 
full course covers four years and leads to the degree of B. 8. There is also a philosophi- 
cal course of 4 years for those who wish to study only one ancient language, which may 
be either Latin or Greek. This leads to the degree of PH. B. Shorter optional courses 
are arranged when necessary in general science and in agriculture. Pupils who have 
not the literary training requisite for admission to the regular college classes may enter 
on studies connected with agriculture and the mechanic arts if they possess suitable 
qualifications for these studies. The agricultural experiment station has been removed 
from the seat of the university to Raleigh, where a suitable building has been provided 
for its use by the board of agriculture. 
Biddle and Shaw Universities and Davidson College have courses in general science 
covering 4 years, Trinity College has one of 3 years, and Weaverville College one whose 
length is not reported. Rutherford and Wake Forest Colleges, in which the arrange- 
ment is that of independent schools, included schools of natural science. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction is given in the theological course of Trinity College (Methodist 
Episcopal South), either in collegiate classes or apart from them, the course requiring, in 
the latter case, from 2 to 3 years for completion; in the School of the Bible, at Wake 
Forest College (Baptist), which does not report the length of its course, but had 14 stu- 
dents enrolled during 1880-’81; in Biddle University (Presbyterian) for colored students, 
where there was a 3 years’ course in theology with 10 pupils engaged in it; and in Shaw 
University (Baptist), also for colored students, which reported 40 students in a 2 years? 
course. For further statistics, see Table XI of the appendix, and forasummary of them, 
the report of the Commissioner preceding.— (Catalogues.) 
Legal instruction was given at date of last reports in the law department of the Uni- 
versity of North Carolina in a 2. years’ course of 9 months each year, and in that of Trin- 
ity College in a 3 years’ course of 40 weeks each.— (Catalogues. ) 
Medical instruction was given in a department of the University of North Carolina, 
which presents a medical course extending over 2 years of 9 months each, and in Shaw 
University, where a department has been opened for the education of colored physicians. 
Two large buildings have been erected for the latter school, one on a site donated by the 
State, and the first term was to begin November 1, 1881.— (Catalogue. ) 1 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. a 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The North Carolina Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, 
Raleigh, organized 1849, is strictly an educational institution, supported by the State, 
for the moral, intellectual, and physical training of the young deaf-mutes and blind of 
both sexes. There are separate departments for the white and colored, the buildings 
being situated a mile apart, but both under the same principal and enjoying equal priv- 
ileges. The course of study embraces all the common English branches, with vocal and 
instrumental music for the blind. Each pupil is required to work two hours and a half 
every day, the employments for the males being mattress, broom, and basket making, 
and chair seating for the blind, and shoe making for the deaf and dumb. The girls in 
both departments sew, knit, and do the mending for all. The blind girls are also

  taught bead work. Everything is provided free of charge, except clothing and travelling 
expenses. There were 109 pupils under instruction during 1881 and 99 present in De- 
cember of that year.— (Report, 1877~’78, and Annals of the Deaf. and Dumb.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
A North Carolina Teachers’ Association was organized in 1878 to promote the cause of 
education in the State and especially to codperate with the State board in perfecting the 
common school system. The constitution provides for one regular annual meeting and 
such other special meetings as shall be determined on. The annual meeting for 1881 
was held at the State University, Chapel Hill. Fifty new members were admitted, offi- 
cers appointed for the ensuing year, resolutions passed indorsing the North Carolina 
Educational Journal as the organ of the association, and, after some other business was 
disposed of, an address on the dignity and importance of the teacher’s profession was 
delivered by County Superintendent Edmund Alexander. A discussion on the ques- 
tion ‘‘ How can quackery be banished from the teaching profession? ’’ was engaged in 
by several members. The executive committee was then charged with the duty of mak- 
ing arrangements for future discussions, when the association adjourned to meet at the 
call of the president.— (North Carolina Educational Journal.) 
ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
A State Association of County Superintendents was organized in September, 1881, 
agreeably to resolutions adopted at a meeting of county superintendents held in June at 
the University Normal School. These resolutions recognized the fact that the new 
school law creating the office of county superintendent was intended to improve the sys- 
tem of public schools in the State, that the people were justly impatient with its slow 
progress, and that improvement could only be brought about by ridding the State of 
incompetent teachers. It was resolved that in the appointment of teachers all outside 
influences should be firmly resisted, rigid examinations strictly adhered to, and merit 
made the only test. 
About 25 superintendents assembled in Raleigh, September 7, in response to the call. 
State Superintendent Scarborough called the convention to order; officers were elected, 
and the association appointed to meet annually on the first Wednesday of July. Ad- 
dresses were delivered by the State superintendent and others, means of enlightening 
the public mind on the subject of education were discussed, and after the adoption of 
resolutions the association adjourned.— (North Carolina Educational Journal.) 
WESTERN TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
A Western North Carolina Teachers’ Association was formed in 1881 during the ses- 
sion of the Newton Normal School. Its purpose is to codperate with the State associ- 
ation in efforts to advance the interests of education. The constitution and regulations 
of the two associations are the same. 
COUNTY TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
In many counties of the State monthly teachers’ associations have been organized, 
with the object of increasing popular interest in the schools as well as aiding in the im- 
provement of teachers. Of the Davie County Association, organized in July, 1881, at 
Mocksville, additional meetings arereported for August, September, and October. The 
one in August was addressed by the State superintendent on the subject of general edu- 
cation. At the October meeting addresses were delivered by several members, the topics 
being ‘‘Sustaining the public schools,’’ ‘‘The duty of the State to educate her people,’”’ 
“The best incentives to study,”’ ‘‘The influence of education on the individual and na- 
tional character,’’ and ‘‘The necessity of religious or moral instruction,’’ At a meeting 
of the Rowan Association, held in October, among other subjects discussed was that of 
‘Corporal punishment in the schools.’’? The conclusion reached was that this means of 
discipline should not at present be entirely abolished, but that it should be used by 
teachers with great caution. At the November meeting of Iredell County Teachers’ As- 
sociation State Superintendent Scarborough gaye an earnest lecture on the subject of 
education, which was well calculated to awaken the interest of his hearers. ‘

  .200 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
  No important change having been made in the school law, there is still, for super- 
visory work, a State commissioner of common schools, elected by the people for 3 years, 
under whom are boards of education elected by the people in cities, villages, special 
districts, and township districts and subdistricts. 
For testing the qualifications of teachers, there are boards of examiners of 3 mem- 
bers: the State board is appointed by the State commissioner; county boards, by the pro- 
bate judge of the county; boards in cities and villages of not less than 2,500 inhabi- 
tants, by their boards of education; all the members of these boards serve 3 years. Cities 
with 10,000 or more inhabitants may have 3, 6, or 9 examiners. City boards have 
almost always superintendents for their schools. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The law provides for the establishment by each board of education of a sufficient num- 
ber of schools for the free education of all youth of school age within the districts under 
its control. Each township board must establish at least one primary school in each 
subdistrict. Any board may establish schools of higher grade also where necessary; in 
cities evening schools may be opened for such as are employed during the day. Separate 
schools for colored children may be organized and schools may be established at chil- 
dren’s homes, orphan asylums, and county infirmaries. The schools must be taught 
not less than 24 nor more than 44 weeks. Attendance for at least 12 weeks is required 
of all sound children from 8 to 14 not receiving instruction elsewhere. The public 
schools are sustained from the interest of a common school fund and from the proceeds 
of a State tax of 1 mill on $1 of all taxable property, when no other rate is fixed, which 
must be used for the payment of teachers only. All contingent expenses are to be met 
and money for the purchase of sites and erection of buildings must be raised by a dis- 
trict tax not to exceed 7 mills on $1, except in Cincinnati, where the limit is 5 mills, 
and in Cleveland, where it is 4} mills. The State common school money is apportioned 
to the counties and by them to the districts and parts of districts in proportion to the 
enumerated youth of school age, any district failing to return the required enumera- 
tion not being entitled to receive any portion of the fund. No person may he employed 
as a teacher in the common schools without a certificate of moral character and quali- 
fication from a board having competent jurisdiction; those employed, except in certain 
specialties, must present such certificate and the required reports in order to receive pay. 
Text books (which must be used 3 years without change) and courses of study are de- 
termined by local boards, and all studies must be taught in English unless the teaching 
of German is demanded by 75 freeholders who represent 40 pupils in such school. The 
Jaw provides for school libraries in districts through an appropriation from the con- 
tingent fund; in cities, through a tax of one-tenth of a mill on the dollar of taxable 
property. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistical summary for 1880-’81 shows some slight advances, but is discouraging 
on the whole. With $603,102 more in receipts for schools than in the previous year 
and with $429,173 more disbursed for them, we find 10 fewer school-houses erected, and 
the cost of those constructed $62,336 less. With an increase reported in the pay of teach- 
ers of both sexes in the country districts, the State school commissioner nevertheless 
estimates a falling off of $19 in the average pay of men for the whole State and of $11 
in that of women. It appears that, although there were 17,112 more children of school 
age, there was a decline of 2,380 in’ enrolment, of 7,584 in the average number on the 
monthly register, and of 8,138 in average daily attendance. This compared with an 
increase of 12,487 in the enrolment during the preceding year, of 13,455 in average 
monthly enrolment, and of 16,289 in average daily attendance is almost inexplicable in 
connection with the excellent work of the able State commissioner and the closer super- 
vision introduced into the greater part of the cities of the State. The commissioner, 
however, remarks that ‘‘the present system in the rural districts of Ohio seems to tend 
to evils which only very positive and persistent effort will even measurably remedy,” 
and he classifies these evils under various heads: (1) the schools are too small for effec- 
tive work and unnecessarily expensive by reason of want of size; (2) the schools being 
isolated, old methods of discipline and teaching are preserved after their vitality has 
ceased and new and better methods have been introduced elsewhere; (3) the under- 
taking to supply the wants of a neighborhood in a single school, together with the ab- 
sence of records of scholarship, involves useless repetition of the same work; the other 
evils the commissioner dwells upon chiefly grow out of the conflicting proyisions of the 
school law.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. ‘ 
There are in all cities in this State boards of education, consisting of 1 or 2 members 
for each ward, elected biennially or annually, in those with over 10,000 inhabitants, ex- 
cept Cincinnati and Cleveland;* in cities with less than 10,000 and over 2,500 inhabitants 
the boards consist of 3 or 6 members for the whole city, elected triennially, with annual 
change of one-third, unless the board, by a majority of its members, provides for the 
election of as many members as the city has wards. The boards of education must ap- 
point in each city boards of examiners and may appoint city superintendents of schools.

202 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Cincinnati, in 1881, had. 28 district, 4 intermediate, 2 high, and 9 evening schools for 
white pupils; 6 district, 2 intermediate, 1 high, and 2 evening schools for colored; and 
a city normal school—all accommodated in 53 buildings, containing 647 rooms, with 
36,881 sittings for study, valued, with sites, &c., at $2,000,000. There were 41 gradu- 
ates in the Hughes High School, 54 in the Woodward, 11 in the Gaines (colored), and 
37 in the evening high school; also 37 in the English and 16 in the German department 
of the normal school: Special teachers are employed for music, drawing, and penman- 
ship. German istaught in 28 district, 12 intermediate, and the high and normal schools, 
about one-half the pupils enrolled receiving instruction in that language. The teachers’ 
normal institute, with English and German departments, held its sixteenth annual ses- 
sion September, 1881. The principals’ and first German assistants’ associations held 
monthly meetings during the year, in which questions:as to courses of study and methods 
of-instruction were considered. The custom of celebrating’authors’ days by reading es- 
says on their lives and works and by the recitation of selections from their writings has 
continued and grown. On the 26th of April, 1881 (the birthday of Uhland and Alice 
Carey), 26,000 pupils of all grades took part in the exercises, and on December 3 a suita- 
ple celebration in honor of Oliver Wendell Holmes was held. In order to give special 
instruction in the early history of the State and county, the anniversary of the settle- 
ment of Ohio, April 7, was observed as ‘‘ pioneer day’? by the high and normal schools 
with appropriate essays, declamations, and readings. The city school for deaf-mutes 
enrolled 40 pupils and had an average attendance of 34. The University of Cincinnati 
offers free instruction to bona fide residents of the city of either sex, and reports five 
courses of study, leading to degrees, and a normal course. A department of metallurgy 
and assaying was added during the year. There was an attendance of 453 in 1881, of 
which number 334 were in the school of design. Private schools had 25 buildings, con- 
taining 285 rooms, with 17,000 sittings for study, and an enrolment of 16,435, with an 
average attendance of 14,953, and 355 teachers.— (City report and return, 1881.) 
Cleveland expended $76,126 for the erection and furnishing of school buildings within 
the year, and reported 42 school-houses, containing 461 rooms, with 22,498 sittings for 
study. Theschools were classed as primary, grammar, and high, with a 4 years’ course 
in each, the high school offering Latin-English, classical, German-English, and English 
courses. The last had been made more thorough in English language and literature 
and in mathematics. There was also, beyond the high school, a city normal, with 4 in- 
structors, 51 students, and 29 graduates in 1881, 25 of which numberengaged in teach- 
ing; while besides the ordinary schools was an unclassified school, to which refractory 
pupils might be sent from the graded schools. Special teachers of music, drawing, elo- 
cution, book-keeping, penmanship, and German were employed; all pupils received in- 
struction in music and drawing, while 8,240 were studying German. Schools were 
taught 195 days. An estimated enrolment of 9,865 was given for private schools.— 
(State and city reports and city return.) 
Columbus had 26 school buildings, with 169 schooland 15 recitation rooms, and 7,570 sit- 
tings for study, all valued at $718,384. Itreported 1 high, 52 grammar, and 82 primary 
schools taught 195 days by 155 regular and 2 special teachers. The per cent. of attend- 
ance on average enrolment was 97 in the high and 95 in primary schools. The classical 
course in the high school is specially commended, and is said to secure more rapid, ad- 
vancement than the college class of Cincinnati schools. A class of 76 graduated in 1881. 
German was taught in some of the schools to 2,185 pupils; the number of children from 
American families attending German-English schools is annually increasing. A Satur- 
day normal school, for teachers desirous of further preparation for their work and mem- 
bers of the senior and junior classes of the high school intending to become teachers, re- 
ported an enrolment of 109; while 2,107 are said to have been in private schools.— (City 
report and return. ) 
Dayton rated its school property at $360,000, which included 14 buildings with sites, 
&e., containing 146 rooms, with 6,340 sittings for study. It classed its schools as dis- 
trict (with primary and grammar grades), intermediate, and high, and reported a 7 
years’ course in the district schools, 1 in the intermediate, and 4 in the high school. 
Four night schools were maintained: one for instruction in free hand drawing, with 290 
students of both sexes; one for industrial drawing, with 113 male students; and 2 for 
common branches, with 131 male students. |The attendance in the drawing schools 
showed a marked increase over that of 1880 and continued good to the close of the term, 
A special class in free hand drawing for mechanics, lasting six weeks of the session, en- 
rolled over 100 students. A number of young men who have been members of the in- 
dustrial drawing class have obtained excellent positions on account of the skill acquired 
in drawing. A city normal school, with a course of one year, had 21 students, all girls, 
with 11 graduates, 7 of whom engaged inteaching. Estimated enrolment in private and 
church schools, 1,802.— (City report and return, 1881.)

with grounds, &c., at $195,000; an expenditure of $33,464 for school purposes; a session 
of 190 days; an enrolment of 2,482, with an average attendance of 1,747 in the lower 
schools, and of 86, with 74 in attendance and 11 graduates, in the high school. There 
were 70 studying Latin, 92 German, and 2,500 music.— (State report, 1881.) 
Zanesville classed its schools as primary and secondary, each with a 3 years’ course, 
senior with 2 years’, and high with 3 years’ English and 4 years’ English-Latin course; also 
colored schools and anormal school. The daily attendance in all was 72 per cent, on 
total enrolment and 92 on the average number belonging. The schools were in session 
197 days, and school property, including 17 school-houses, with 76 rooms, was valued at 
$200,000. Special teachers of music and writing were employed. There were 3,000 
studying drawing and 208 German. Private schools reported 15 school rooms and 500 
pupils.— (City report and return. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOLS. — 
Although the State makes no provision for the education of teachers, there are normal 
schools, with model schools attached, connected with the public school system in the 
cities of Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Dayton, and Saturday normal classes in Columbus 
and Toledo. The Cincinnati school was established in 1868 and a German department | 
added in 1871. The standard of admission was higher for 1881 than for any previous 
year, with an enrolment of 56, of whom 53 graduated. Of the 56, all but 20 were grad- 
uates of the city high schools. The standard has been raised and the course is now strictly 
professional, extending through 1 year. Practice in the training schools (in which there 
are 6 classes), under the supervision of 3 critic teachers, is required. The Cleveland 
school, established in 1874, had 4 instructors, 51 students, and 29 graduates, of which 
number 25 have since engaged in teaching. The requirement for admission is a diploma 
from the Cleveland high school or some academic institution of equal grade. In the lat- 
ter case, an examination in high school branches is exacted. The Dayton school, estab- 
lished in 1869, had a department of theory and one of observation and practice, with one 
year as the minimum time for completion of the course; for 1881 it reported 4 instructors, 
15 students, and 8 graduates, 7 of whom engaged in teaching. The Columbus Saturday 
normal (open to members of the senior and junior classes of the high school who contem- 
plate teaching, and to teachers engaged in teaching who desire further study and instruc- 
tion) enrolled 109 and had a session of 28 days. 
PRIVATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The private normal schools reporting as such to this Bureau for 1881 are: (1) North- 
western Ohio Normal School, Ada, which, in teachers’ courses of 2 and 3 years, had 1,100 
pupils classed as normal, besides 301 others, under 26 instructors, and graduated 17; (2) 
‘Ashland College Normal and Training School, Ashland, which had a 4 years’ course, with 8 
instructors and 67 normal students; (3) Ohio Central Normal and Kindergarten Training 
School, which, organized at Worthington in 1872 and removed to Fayette in 1881, had 
English and classical normal courses of 2and 3 years, a class for training Kindergartners, 
and a normal institute at the close of the spring term; (4) Geneva Normal School, Geneva, 
which had 52 students in a 4 years’ teachers’ course and 59 in other departments, under 7 
instructors; (5) National Normal University, Lebanon, which had a 2} years’ teachers’ 
course and a summer normal institute of 8 weeks, and reported 1,752 pupils classed as 
normal, with 30 others, under 25 instructors, graduating 79; (6) Mansfield Normal College, 
Mansfield (organized 1878), which had also a summer institute and a teachers’ course of 
3 years, in which were enrolled about 375 pupils, under 6 instructors; (7) Western Re-
-P-A-G-E-483
  
' OHIO. 205 
serve Normal School, Milan, which, in a 3 years’ normal course, had 30 students, besides 
44 in other departments, under 3 instructors; and (8) the Normal Department of Mount 
Union College, Mount Union, which reported 110 normal students, under 7 instructors. 
Millersburg Normal School, Millersburg, formerly reporting, was closed June 9, 1881. 
In addition to those above mentioned, normal departments or teachers’ courses exist. 
in connection with Buchtel, Hiram, Franklin, Muskingum, Rio Grande, Scio, Xenia, 
and Antioch Colleges, and Baldwin, Ohio Wesleyan, and Wilberforce Universities and 
the University of Cincinnati; also, in the following academies: Grand River Institute, 
Academy of Central College, Geauga Seminary, Fostoria Academy, Hopedale Normal 
School, Atwood Institute, Marlborough Union School, Pleasantville Collegiate Institute, 
Northern Ohio Collegiate Institute, Western Reserve Seminary, and Dague’s Collegiate 
Institute.— (Catalogues and returns. ) 
For statistics of normal schools reporting, see Table III of the appendix, and fora sum- 
mary of these statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Fees of 50 cents from each applicant for examination go to make up a teachers’ insti- 
tute fund. The law permits the holding of institutes, of at least 4 days in length, in 
any county where 30 regular teachers declare in writing their intention to attend. An 
association of teachers of several adjacent counties may be held for the purpose of pro- 
viding professional instruction for the teachers of such counties. 
There were 85 institutes held during the year, 2 less than in 1880, at a cost of $18,968, 
with an aggregate attendance of 10,672 persons. All but one had more than 50 in 
attendance, while 20 had from 150 to 239, Thirty-two were continued two weeks or 
more; the remainder, one week. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Ohio Educational Monthly, Salem, the organ of the State Teachers’ Association, 
and the Teachers’ Guide, Mallet Creek, also a monthly, continued in 1881 to furnish 
valuable information as to methods of instruction and government and also as to the 
progress of educational matters in the State and elsewhere, the former being then in its 
twenty-second volume, the latter in its seventh. 
The Mutes’ Chronicle, published weekly at theState institution for deaf-mutes, Colum- 
bus, entered upon its thirteenth volume in 1881, andin September of that year changed 
its title to Vis-d-Vis. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State commissioner, in comparing high school statistics for 1881 with those for 1880, 
reported 575 rooms in use, an increase of 8; 514 men and 260 women teaching, a total 
increase of 76; and an enrolment of 28,362, with a daily attendance of 20,078, in city, 
village, and special district high schools, a decrease of 495 enrolled and of 143 in attend- 
ance; while in township district high schools, with 1,577 enrolled and 877 in attendance, 
there was an increase of 323 in enrolment and of 80 in attendance. There were 6,821 
studying Latin, 480 Greek, and 347 French, a decrease of 319 in Latin and of 71 in 
French, but an increase of 32 in Greek.— (State report, 1881.) 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private academic schools, preparatory schools, or preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables. VI, VII, and IX, and for business colleges, Table IV ofthe 
appendix. Forsummaries of such statistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Ohio State University, Columbus, open alike to both sexes, has a preparatory course © 
of 2 years, corresponding with that of the better grade of high schools, for those who 
enter directly from the common or district schools, a regular classical course of 4 years, 
and scientific courses of 3 and 4 years, besides special courses. Graduates of high schools 
of the State with efficient courses of study are admitted to the fres’:man class of any 
course for which their previous study has fitted them. The whole number enrolled in 
1880-81 was 365, while there were 280 in actual attendance in November, 1881.— (Cata- 
logue, 1881.) 
The School of Design of the University of Cincinnati, organized and opened in 1869 with 
a class of 30 pupils, has steadily increased, until in 1880-’81 it became’substantially a 
\college of art. It offers a thoroughly graded course of instruction and confers upon

  206 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
students the diploma of the university. The school reported 7 instructors and 312 stu- 
dents in 1881. 
The Ohio University, Athens, organized in 1809, is the oldest literary institution north- 
west of the Ohio River. Its existence was provided for 4s early as 1787 in the purchase 
made from the United States by the Ohio Company of Associates, whereby two town- 
ships were set apart for the purpose of a university and placed under the care of the 
legislature. Its trustees are appointed by State authority (the governor being ex officio. 
a member of the board) and are required to make an annual report to the State legis- 
lature. One student from each county in the State is admitted free of tuition. The: 
State appropriated $20,000 for the improvement of the buildings in 1881 and the es 
ular income was increased by about $3,000 a year. 
From 39 colleges, including the three before mentioned, reports in some form ave 
come in for 1881 or for the immediately preceding years. All, except the University of 
Cincinnati, offered preparatory courses of 2 to 4 years; all had the customary classical 
collegiate course of 4 years; regular scientific courses were offered in 32,! most of them 
covering four years; while in ‘8 institutions? there were philosophical courses of like 
length. Twelve had commercial courses, and 18 (previously mentioned. under Training 
of Teachers) presented arrangements for normal instruction; St. Xavier, Mt. Union, 
and Oberlin Colleges, with the University of Cincinnati, offered literary courses of 4 
years. , At Ohio Wesleyan University there was a like course for ladies only. Others, 
to be mentioned under Professional Instruction, had provisions for instruction in the- 
ology, law, and medicine. The University of Cincinnati offered graduate courses for the 
degrees of A. M., M.S., and PH. D. Special, elective, English, German, and French 
courses were also offered by different colleges, while most gave instruction in modern 
languages, music, drawing, and painting. 
For the statistics of the institutions reporting, see Table IX of the appendix, and for 
a summary of statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Thirty of the 39 colleges for young men admit young women also to their advantages 
for full literary training, besides which 13 schools especially designed for them offer sub- 
stantially collegiate training, in 5 cases with degrees. All have regular collegiate courses 
of 4 years; 4 begin with the Kindergarten system; 3 have normal classes or departments; 
several offer special courses and graduate studies, while all give instruction in music, 
drawing, painting, and modern languages. 
For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix, and a summary of it in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Ohio State University, Columbus, offers 4 distinet courses of scientific study, viz, 
in agriculture and in civil, mining, and mechanical engineering. That in agriculture 
extends over 4 years, the others 3 years each. A department of horticulture and botany 
‘was established and opened te students at the spring term of 1881. The third course of 
“lectures to farmers,”’ given in January, 1881, by the professors of the university, was 
attended by 164 farmers.— (Catalogue, 1881.) 
Scientific courses, in most cases of 4 years, are found in 30 of the colleges reporting. 
The University of Cincinnati offers also a 4 years’ course in civil engineering. 
A department of science and arts was organized in connection with the Mechanics’ 
Institute of Cincinnati in January, 1881. Sections of chemistry, mechanics, and engineer- 
ing have already been formed for special work, and similar sections of electricity and 
architecture are being organized. Monthly meetings, a course of lectures, and a journal 
published under direction of the department are the means of instruction used.— (Report 
of Department of Science and Arts of the Mechanics’ Institute.) 
The Case School of Applied Science, Cleveland, intending to give thorough technical and 
professional training in the principles of natural and physical science with their applica- 
tions to the arts, was incorporated in 1880 and opened with a preparatory term of 12 
weeks in the spring of 1881. The course of study will extend through 4 years, the first 
2 preparatory, the last 2 professional or technical. _ Under arrangements made in 1881, 
it was to form the scientific department of Western Reserve University, which was to be 
established in Cleveland in 1882, with Adelbert College for its classical department. _ An 
elegant building for the last had been promised by Mr. Amasa Stone, of Cleveland, as 
amemorial of a deceased son.     
1The exceptions here were Hebrew Union, St. Joseph’s, and St. Xavier Colleges, Cincinnati Kenyon College, Gambier; Richmond College, Richmond, and Antioch College, Yellow Springs. 2 Ashland, Bucktel, Farmers’, Marietta, Mt. Union, and Wilmington Colleges, with the Ohio State and Denison Universities.

PROFESSIONAL. 
Courses in theology, covering 3 years and meant to follow collegiate training, existed in 
1881 at German Wallace College, Berea (Methodist Episcopal); Lane Theological Sem- 
inary, Cincinnati, and the theological department of Oberlin College, Oberlin (both 
Presbyterian); Theological Seminary of Evangelical Lutheran Synod, Columbus; Union 
Biblical Seminary, Dayton (United Brethren); Theological Seminary, Kenyon College, 
Gambier (Protestant Episcopal); Heidelberg Theological Seminary, Tiffin (Reformed 
Church); and in like schools of Urbana University, Urbana (New Church), and of the 
United Presbyterians at Xenia. Courses occupying 1 year at Geneva College, West 
Geneva (Reformed Presbyterian), and 2 years at Wittenberg College, Springfield (Evan- 
gelical Lutheran), were noted:in the Jast reports from these schools; at the Seminary of 
St. Charles Borromeo, Carthagena, and at that of St. Mary, Cleveland (both Roman 
Catholic), there were courses nominally of 9 and 5 years, but some academic studies were 
included. At Wilberforce University, for colored students, the course was of 4 years, 
partly literary, and at Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware (Methodist Episcopal), as 
well as at Hiram College, Hiram (Disciples), studies in theology accompanied the college 
course. 
For statistics of theological schools and departments reporting, see Table XI of the 
appendix, and asummary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
For instruction in daw the law school of the Cincinnati College, organized in 1833, has 
a 2 years’ course of study. Candidates for admission to the junior class must give satis- 
factory evidence of a good English education. 
Wilberforce University provides a law department, but makes no report of students 
in it. 
Statistics for Cincinnati College Law School may be found in Table XII of the ap- 
endix. 
» The ‘re; ir’? medical schools reporting for 1880-’81 were the Cincinnati College of 
Medicine and Surgery, the Medical College of Ohio, and the Miami Medical College, all 
in Cincinnati; the medical department of Western Reserve University, Cleveland (formed ’ 
by a union of the Cleveland Medical College and the medical department of Wooster 
University); Columbus Medical College, Columbus; and Starling Medical College, Co- 
Jumbus. All had the customary 3 years’ course of study under a physician, including 2 
regular lecture courses of 20 weeks each year in those at Cincinnati and of 24 weeks in 
the others, the last of which courses must be in the college conferring the degree. The 
3 at Cincinnati and the Starling Medical College, Columbus, offered courses of 3 years, 
and this last was to require such a course after 1882. The school at Western Reserve 
University, Cleveland, admits women. 
The Eclectic Medical Institute, Cincinnati, the Pulte Medical College, Cincinnati 
(homeopathic), and the Homeopathic Hospital College, Cleveland, open alike to both 
sexes, require 3 years of study, including attendance on 2 lecture courses of 20 weeks 
yearly in the first named, 23 weeks in the second, and 22 in the third. All offer 3 
years’ optional graded courses. The homeopathic schools require a good English edu- 
cation for admission. 
The Ohio College of Dental Surgery, Cincinnati, and the Cincinnati College of Pharmacy 
have 2 years’ courses, in the former of 4 months each year, in the latter of 5 months. 
The latter requires 4 years of practice with a qualified pharmacist. 
For statistics of medical schools reporting, see Table XIII of the appendix, and sum- 
mary of it in report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Ohio Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Columbus (established 
1829), receives pupils from 8 to 21, and reported 512 under instruction for 1881, with a 
daily average of 426 in attendance and 18 graduates, every one of whom at leaving was 
able to earn a livelihood. The whole number admitted from the beginning was 1,886. 
Instruction is givenin the common and higher English branches, the school being graded 
as primary, grammar, and academic; articulation is also taught. Theshops were crowded 
with boys and men; the trades taught are shoemaking, printing, bookbinding, and car- 
pentry. i 
The Cincinnati Day School for Deaf-Mutes, under control of the city board of education, 
reported an enrolment of 40, with 34 in average attendance. 
The Ohio Institution for the Education of the Blind, Columbus, reported for 1881 a total 
enrolment of 243, of which number 49 were new pupils. The daily average was 171; 
whole number from the beginning, 1,138. Instruction was given in the common and 
higher English branches, and in music, sewing and knitting by hand and machine; bead

  208 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
work, cane seating, and broom making were so taught as to enable almost all to sup- 
port themselves by work after leaving the institution. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Ohio Institution for the Education of Idiotic and Imbecile Youth, Columbus, admits 
children from 6 to 15 and instructs them in the common English branches. There were 
613 inmates in 1880. No report has reached this Bureau for 1881, the central part of its 
main: building having been burned November 19, 1881. 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Industrial School and Home, Cleveland, maintained by the Children’s Aid Society 
of that city, in 1881 moved into a commodious building donated by Mr. Amasa Stone, 
and reported 242 children cared for and trained that year, 111 placed in permanent 
homes, 77 returned to relatives, and 53 remaining at the close of the year. 
The Toledo Industrial School enrolled 84 in its day school and 177 in its Saturday sew- 
ing school. 
The Girl’s Industrial Home, Delaware, reported 318 inmates for 1881; of whom 69 
were committed during the year. The common English branches, housework, and dress- 
making are taught. 
The Cincinnati House of Refuge had 266 inmates in 1881, with a daily average of 251; 
the House of Refuge and Correction, Cleveland (for both sexes), had 164, with a daily 
average of 123; the State Reform School for Boys, Lancaster, 734, with a daily average of 557; 
the House of Refuge and Correction, Toledo (for boys only), 239, with a daily average of 
170. All, it is believed, aim to instruct their inmates as far as possible in school studies 
and productive industries, as well as in morals. 
HOMES AND ASYLUMS FOR ORPHAN OR DEPENDENT CHILDREN. . 
; 
Seventeen homes of this kind, under city, church, or private care, report for 1881 a 
total of 2,445 inmates, under 215 instructors or other employés. Eleven others, under 
county control, are reported by the State board of charities to have had 1,297 in the 
same year, with an average of 773, under 47 officers and teachers. One more, the 
Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Orphans’ Home, Xenia, under State care, is said by the same board 
to have had 715 on its roll within the year, and an average of 607, under 38 officers and 
teachers. Total of inmates for all 3 classes, 4,457, under 300 instructors and assistants. 
In most cases these children are taught common English studies, as far as may be prac- 
ticable, and such industries as will fit them for self support. 
For further information, see Table XXII of the appendix to this volume, and a cor- 
responding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
EDUCATION IN ART. 
Instruction in art in its various forms is given at Cincinnati in the School of Design of 
the University of Cincinnati, in connection with the Women’s Art Museum Association, 
and in the School of Design of the Ohio Mechanics’ Institute; at Columbus, in the 
Columbus Art School. The School of Design of the University of Cincinnati, free to all 
bona fide residents of that city, offers a thorough graded course of instruction in all its 
departments, and reports a faculty of 7 members, with about 300 pupils. The students 
in wood carving, as far as reported, are all girls. A private wood carving school opened 
by a lady is said to have been successful, and a Pottery Club, consisting entirely of 
women, was well attended. The Art Museum, to be located at Eden Park, a suburb of 
Cincinnati, for the foundation of which Mr. C. W. West offered $150,000 provided the city 
would raise a like amount, has received from that gentleman $150,000 for its endow- 
ment. The Columbus Art School, opened October, 1880, is said to be the only art school 
in Ohio, except the School of Design in Cincinnati, and to have as full a course of study 
as any art school in the West. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Ohio State Teachers’ Association held its thirty-second annual meeting at Put-in 
Bay June 28-31, 1881. In the superintendents’ section the opening address was deliv- 
ered by Superintendent W. J. White, of Springfield. Papers on ‘‘School examinations’? 
and on ‘‘Clerical work of teachers’’ were read by Superintendent H. N. Mertz and Hon. 
T. W. Harvey, and discussed by Hon. D.'F. De Wolf and W. D. Henkle. In his inaugu- 
ral address on the ‘‘Future of our public schools’’ before the general association, Prof. 
John Ogden stated that the greatest want in the Ohio school system was an administra- 
tive head, such as a State board of education, and normal schools for the training of 
teachers, especially for the rural schools, where skilled workers are most needed. Papers  
-P-A-G-E-487
  
  OHIO. 209 
on ‘‘Mental science for public school teachers,’’ ‘‘The spirit of the teacher,’’ ‘‘State as- 
sistance,’’ and ‘‘English literature for the schoolmaster’’ were read and discussed. The 
annual address was delivered by Rev. J. E. Twitchell, on the ‘‘Science of religion and 
the religion of science.’’ After passing appropriate resolutions and electing officers for 
the nee year, the convention adjourned.— (Ohio Educational Monthly, September, 
1881. 
OTHER TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
Theseveral associations were held as follows: Central Ohio, at Dayton, with 500 teachers 
in attendance; Southwestern, at Hamilton; Northwestern, at Fostoria; Northeastern, 
with quarterly meetings, at Cleveland and elsewhere; Southeastern, at Logan; Eastern, 
at Bellaire; Tri-State, at Toledo; and theState Association of Colored Teachers, at Spring- 
field. The music teachers of the State have organized an association, which was to hold 
its first meeting in March, 1882. 
OHIO COLLEGE ASSOCIATION. 
No notice of the meeting of this influential and learned body of presidents and pro- 
fessors for 1881 has reached the Bureau. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
HON. WILLIAM DOWNS HENKLE. 
The educational interests, not merely of Ohio, but of the whole United States suffered a 
serious loss when this good man, ripe scholar, able teacher, effective school officer, and 
useful writer died, November 22, 1881, at Salem, Ohio, aged 53. His father, a Methodist 
minister, had died at Louisville, Ky., when this ‘son was barely 6 years old, and had 
left to wife and children an inheritance of poverty. Young Henkle had consequently to 
hew his own way through life, and he did it well. Returning to his native State after 
his father’s death, first to Urbana and then to Springfield, he attended school for four 
or five years, and afterward struck out for himself. By shovelling sand and driving teams 
he was able to buy some books, and, with the aid of a young student, mastered the ele- 
ments of grammar, arithmetic, and natural philosophy. He then came under the tuition 
of a Springfield teacher, who was subsequently chief justice of the State, and studied 
successfully with him Latin and the elements of algebra. At 16 he was graduated from 
the high school, delivering a Latin salutatory. While teaching school for three years he 
pursued at Wittenberg College and under a private teacher the study of French, German, 
Greek, and higher mathematics. Returning with his mother to Urbana, after teaching 
for another year, at 20 years of age he became principal of theacademy in 1848. Thence- 
forward he grew to be more and more a power for good, securing the organization at 
Urbana and Mechanicsburg of union school systems, of which he was made successively 
the head; then taking charge for three years of the classical department of a school at 
Greenmont, Ind., where he published two valuable works on algebra, and whence he 
was called to superintend the city schools of Richmond, Ind. The law under which this 
office had been created being pronounced unconstitutional, he went in 1856 to Indianapo- 
lis to be teacher of the high school and an editor of the Indiana School Journal, then just 
established. He held these positions till August, 1859, when he returned to Ohio as 
professor of mathematics in the Southwestern Normal School at Lebanon, which he helped 
to make one of the most popular and successful of its kind. In 1862 he received the 
Republican nomination for State commissioner of common schools, but failed of elec- 
tion, and for two years was superintendent of the schools of Lebanon, and then for five 
years of those of Salem. He filled these positions with such marked success that on 
the resignation of the State school commissionership by Hon. John A. Norris he was 
selected by Governor Hayes to fill for nearly two years the unexpired term, 1869 to 1871. 
Returning then to Salem, he was made for four years more superintendent of the schools 
there, and in 1875 became proprietor and editor of the Ohio Educational Monthly,-which, 
with another paper, Notes and Queries, he filled till his death with the evidences of his 
sound judgment, large erudition, practical good sense, and educational enthusiasm.

. STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of public instruction, elected by the people every 4 years, and 
a State board of education, composed of the governor, secretary of state, and superin- 
tendent of public instruction, have general supervision of public school affairs. The 
local officers are county superintendents of common schools, elected by the people for 
two years, and district boards of 3 directors and a clerk, elected at district meetings, 
the directors for 3 years, one going out each year, and the clerk elected for one year.

OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public school moneys are derived from an irreducible State school fund, a county tax 
of 4 mills on $1 (raised from 3 mills in 1882), and a district tax on real and personal 
property, the latter levied only when a majority of the legal voters of a district so decide. 
By a new law, districts may also levy rate bills. The interest from the school fund is 
divided among the counties in proportion to the children 4 to 20 years old, but the age 
for admission to public school is 6 to 21. Districts are not entitled to their proportion 
of this fund unless schools shall have been taught therein for at least three months in 
each year and a report has been made to the county superintendents by the first Mon- 
day in March. County superintendents must make a general report to the State super- 
intendent of public instruction by the first Monday in April of each year, and a finance 
report to the county court the 30th of June. Any county superintendent failing to per- 
form the various duties required of him becomes liable to a fine of $100, and for failing 
to report annually to the State superintendent forfeits his office. The State superin- 
tendent reports to the legislature biennially. It is the duty of county superintendents 
to examine teachers and give them certificates of 2 grades, the higher good for 2 years, 
the lower for 6 months. Life and State diplomas, the latter good for 6 Years, are given 
on examination by the State board of education, which may also issue certificates of first 
and second grades. If teachers suffer injustice at the hands of the county superintendent 
they may appeal to the State superintendent, who is authorized to grant them certifi- 
cates of the same force as those issued by county superintendents. High schools must 
be supported in all districts containing 1,000 persons 4 to 20 years of age. One or more 
schools may be taught in the German language in districts having 10,000 or more in- 
habitants; and by a new law, whenever a city or incorporated town has that number, 
all school districts or parts of districts within its limits must constitute one school dis- 
trict, its boundaries being the same as those of the town or city. Since 1870 at least 
(not, as stated in the report for 1880, since 1878), widows with children to educate and 
liable to taxation for school purposes have had the right to vote at the meetings of the 
school districts in which they reside. A rule of the State board permits teachers in the 
public schools to dismiss pupils under 8 years of age after a 4 hours’ session or shorten 
their confinement to 3} hours by recess. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
With an increase of 2,026 in the number of youth 4 to 20 years of age there were 3,035 
fewer children 6 to 21 enrolled in publicschoolsin 1880-’81 and 2,239 fewer in average daily 
attendance. The average school term was shorter by 3.6 days and the average monthly 
pay of teachers less by $1.93 for men and $1.66 for women. There were, however, more pu- 
pils by 1,094 in graded schools, and 612 more were attending private schools. Thirty more 
school Gistricts were organized and 28 more sent reports. Seven more public graded 
schools were taught and 44 more private schools. The number of teachers employed was 
increased by 25, the number holding first grade certificates by 12. | Public school prop- 
erty was valued at $89,606 more than in 1879-’80; receipts for public school purposes 
were increased by $20,139 and expenditure by $11,300. 
State Superintendent Powell thinks the above shows a fair degreeof progress, notwith- 
standing the decrease reported in enrolment and average attendance. The chief exception 
noted by him to the general satisfactory condition is the falling off in the average length 
of the school term. This is kept low by the short terms in country districts, many of 
which were only of 3 months and would probably have been even less had they not been 
required to be kept up to that point in order to draw public money.!_ The superintendent 
favors an amendment to the law requiring the levy of a State school tax of 2 mills on the 
dollar; he also recommends that the minimum school term which shall entitle districts 
to receive theirshare of such money be made 6 months. Other needs noted are means for 
the professional training of teachers and for a more energetic and thorough supervision of 
the schools. Itis recommended that, in the absence of a State normal school, provision be 
made for county normal institutes of from 2 to 4 weeks, and that all teachers be required 
to attend them. To secure better supervision, an increase is recommended in the pay 
of county superintendents. The position of superintendent, it is argued, should com- 
mand a greater salary than that of the highest teacher, in order that it may be possible 
to place in it the best teachers and those who will give their whole time to the work.

STATISTICS. 
With a population of 17,577 in the city of Portland, school district No. 1 of Multo- 
nomah County, with limits not precisely like those of the city, reported 5,314 between 4 
and 20 years of age, 2,972 pupils attending public schools and 2,172 in average daily at- 
tendance, an increase since the last report of 322 in the number enrolled and of 216 in 
average attendance. There were also about 600 in private and parochial schools. The 
per capita cost of education in public schools was $23.63 on the average number belong- 
ing and $24.85 based on that in average daily attendance; the whole expenditure for 
public schools, $81,371.46, and the estimated value of school property, $170,600. In the 
high school there were 201 pupils registered and 170 in average attendance under 6 
teachers. A class of 21 was graduated in June, 1881: The printed report for the year 
closing June, 1881, shows an average attendance of 95 per cent. based on the average 
number belonging and a large decrease in tardiness, though no unusual effort had been 
made to secure the latter. There were twice as many cases of corporal punishment, but 
fewer suspensions than the year before. A change was made in the grading of teachers’ 
salaries, giving preference to experience and fitness and recognizing the importance of 
good teaching in primary grades. The pay of teachers in the lowest grade was raised. 
from $625 to $750 a year, and only teachers of experience and special talent are to be 
employed in that grade.— (Return and printed report.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL COURSES. 
Ashland College and Normal School, Ashland, first opened in 1879, had 61 normal 
pupils during 1880-’81 (29 men and 32 women), 4 instructors, and 3 graduates. The 
full course extended over 3 years of 36 weeks each.'— (Return. ) 
At the University of Oregon, Eugene City, there was in the collegiate department a 3 
years’ normal course with English studies only, having 9 students in 1880-81 and 10 
entered for 1881~’82. Blue Mountain University, La Grande, and Willamette Univer- 
sity, Salem, offered instruction for teachers in normal courses in their preparatory de- 
partments; the latter, in a well arranged 3 years’ course. Santiam Academy, Lebanon; 
‘Wasco Independent Academy, The Dalles; and McMinnville College, McMinnville, also 
offered like instruction. 
The normal department of Christian College, Monmouth, was suspended in 1880-81 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The law requires the superintendent to hold annually a teachers’ institute in each. 
judicial district, as well as one State teachers’ institute. 
Sixteen institutes were held during the year and were attended by 733 teachers, an 
increase over the previous year of 1 institute and 26 teachers. By a regulation of the 
State board, of education teachers in public schools are required to attend the institutes 
held in their counties under authority of law; for unexcused failure to attend at least 
one session each year, they are liable either to be reduced in grade or to have their certifi- 
cates revoked. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The number of public high schools in the State has not been reported by State au- 
thority since 1878, when there were 22. In the United States census report for 1880 the 
number given is 17. According to law, such schools must be sustained in all districts 
containing as many as 1,000 persons 4 to 20 years of age. The numberof graded schools 
increased by 7 and of pupils in them by 1,094. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private secondary schools reporting and preparatory departments of 
colleges, see Tables VI and IX of the appendix, and summaries of them in the report of 
the Commissioner preceding.   
1 This and the Oregon Normal School, Monmouth, are to be recognized as State normal schools from October, 1882.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN AND FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Oregon, Eugene, organized in 1876, comprisescollegiateand prepar- 
atory departments, the former with classical and scientific courses of 4 years and a nor- 
malone of 3 years. Thescientific differs from the classical course in the substitution of 
scientificand modern language studies for Latinand Greek; the degree given on completion 
of each is A. B. Every county in the State is entitled toa scholarshipin the collegiate de- 
partment and an additional one for each member of the legislative assembly to which 
such county may be entitled. Candidates for scholarships must pass an examination in 
the fundamental English branches, including history of the United States. The sexes 
are admitted on equal terms, and out of 72 students in the undergraduate classes of the 
‘collegiate department in 1881, 25 were young women. The president of the board of 
regents says the attendance during 1880-81 was generally good, and that the students 
were industrious and conducted themselves becomingly. 
Of 8 other collegiate institutions in the State, 7 admit young women, 1— Willamette 
University, Salem —providing for them a separate Woman’s College, with a lady dean, 
but instructing them in the same courses and classesas the young men. The only excep- 
tion to this admission of women is at St. Michael’s College, Portland, the literary sta- 
tus of which is as yet uncertain. Corvallis College, Corvallis; Pacific University, Forest 
Grove; Blue Mountain University, La Grande; McMinnville College, McMinnville; Chris- 
tian College, Monmouth; Philomath College, Philomath, and Willamette University 
have arrangements for preparatory instruction, in some cases beginning with primary 
classes; all have the customary classical and scientific courses of 4 years each, except 
Pacific University, which makes its scientific course 3 years, and Corvallis College, 
which dividesits studies into 7 separate schools, only one of which, that of mathematics, 
has a definite term of 4 years. Pacific University has a ladies’ course of 3 years; Philo- 
math College, one of 4 years; Christian, Philomath, and Willamette, business courses, 
the same three, with Blue Mountain University, offering instruction in music, drawing, 
and painting. For statistics of these institutions, see Table IX. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
Besides the opportunities for collegiate instruction presented at the State University 
and the 7 other colleges above named, there is one institution approximating collegiate 
rank thatis especially for young women, St. Helen’s Hall, Portland, an academic sem- 
inary, under the care of the Protestant Episcopal bishop of Oregon and a corpsof assist- 
ants. For statistics of this, see Table VIII of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
General scientific instruction is given, as already noted, by most of the colleges and 
universities in courses usually extending over 4 years. Besides this, there is opportu- 
nity for the study of sciences pertaining to agriculture and engineering in the State Agri- 
cultural College, Corvallis, a department of Corvallis College, in its schools of agricult- 
ure and engineering. The latter has not yet been fully organized for want of funds; but 
the general principles of civil engineering are taught; also, drawing, descriptive geometry, , 
and shades and shadows; while other studies belonging to the course are taught in the 
schools of mathematics and physics. The law provides for the free tuition of 60 young 
men over 16 years of age, who may be admitted into all departments of the college. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Some theological instruction was formerly given in McMinnville College, but there is 
no mention of such a course in the catalogue for 1880-’81. 
The medical department of Willamette University, Portland, is the only professional 
school reporting. The course of study required for graduation comprehends 3 years of 
work; it includes 2 terms of lectures and a year of preliminary study; there is also a 3 
years’ graded course. The faculty recommend students to attend 3 terms of lectures before 
presenting themselves for graduation and encourage them by the offer of free tuition dur- 
ing the last year. In the course prescribed, the lecture terms extend only over 20 weeks 
each, the minimum required by the American Medical Association. There were 32 
students during the year, 30 at date of report, and 13 graduates. Women are admitted 
to this as to other departments of the university. An examination for admission is re- 
quired of applicants who are not graduates of college, academy, or high school.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Otegon School for Deaf-Mutes, Salem, founded in 1870, was made a State institu- 
tion in 1880, and placed under the superintendence of a board of 9 directors, of whom 6 
are appointed by the governor and 3 by the Salem Society to Promote the Education of 
Deaf-Mutes. There were 39 pupils under instruction during 1881 (7 of them semi- 
mutes), under 3 instructors, of whom 1 was a deaf-mute. No employments have yet 
been provided. The children are in school from 9 o’clock to 12 and from 1 to 3, the 
eommon English branches being taught. The manual method is the one uséd. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Oregon Institute for the Blind, Salem, was closed in 1879. No later information . 
concerning it has reached this Office. : 
SCHOOL FOR INDIAN YOUTH. . 
A school for the education of Indian youth was opened in Forest Grove March 1, 1880, 
by the United States Government, Captain M. C. Wilkinson, U. Ss. A., in charge. The 
pupils are all instructed in English branches, the boys also in blacksmithing, shoemak- 
ing, carpentry, and gardening and other agricultural work, and the girls in sewing and 
housework. Up to September 14, 1881, there had been 75 pupils received, 29 girls'and 
46 boys, their ages ranging from 8 to 25 years. The Government, however, has decided 
not to receive any more who are over 16. All have made satisfactory progress and many 
have improved wonderfully. They.learn easily, work hard and well when they have 
an incentive to labor, are of good disposition, affectionate, obedient, and are much more 
easily managed than an equal number of whites. 
In the Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for 1881 strong testimony from 
various sources is presented as to the success achieved alike in school studies, in indus- 
trial pursuits, and in general civilizing influences. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. i 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-first annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at Salem, 
beginning August 21, 1881, State Superintendent L. J. Powell presiding. An address of 
welcome by the former State superintendent, Dr. L. L. Rowland, of Salem, commendatory 
of teachers’ institutes and associations, was read in his absence by Miss Olivia Rowland, 
and Prof. O. P. Lee, of Eugene City, responded. Bishop J. F. Hurst, of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, delivered an address on ‘‘Imagination,’’ and D. C. H. Fowler, of New 
York, one on the need of thorough work in education. ‘‘Physical geography’? was 
presented by Prof. W. N. Ferrin, of Pacific University, who urged the importance 
of teaching this branch in the public schools. Prof. C. W. Roby, of Portland, read 
a paper on ‘‘Education and the State,” after which there was a general discussion of 
Professor Ferrin’s paper. Superintendent Rigler, of Polk County, read a carefully pre- 
pared paper on the ‘‘Necessity for better teachers, and how to secure them,’’ in which 
he argued in favor of State normal schools, teachers’ institutes, educational journals, and 
better pay for teachers. A general discussion followed, in the course of which Superin- 
tendent Moses, of Linn County, spoke of the wisdom of increasing the pay of teachers. 
. Superintendent J. T. Gregg, of Marion County, delivered an address on ‘‘ Teachers’ ex- 
aminations,’’ and Rt. Rev. B. Wistar Morris, one on the importance of careful early 
training. On Wednesday, Prof. M. Bailey, of the State University, discussed ‘‘Cen- 
tripetal forces and gravitation;’’? Miss Christina MacConnell, of Portland, presented an 
excellent practical paper on ‘‘Science in school,” and Professor Condon, of the State 
University, ‘‘ The rights of evolution, or the sciences in the common schools,”’ and Prof. 
Joseph Emory, of the State Agricultural College, the ‘‘Relation of common schools 
to colleges,” showing the dependence of the lower and higher schools on each other. 
During the evening session an address was delivered by Rev. J. A. Gray, of Portland, 
and one by Prof. E. B. McElroy, State superintendent elect; a paper on ‘‘Reminis- 
cences of a teacher’? was read by Mrs. R. Newcomb, of Portland; recitations were given 
by Miss A. R. Luse and Miss Georgia Carpenter; and after a chorus by the Salem Glee 
Club the association adjourned.

  216 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
Public school affairs are in charge of a State superintendent of public instruction, 
who is appointed by the governor, with the consent of the senate, and holds office 4 
years. He is assisted by two deputy superintendents and four clerks chosen by himself. 
Local school officers comprise district school directors elected by the people for three 
years, one going out each year, and county superintendents chosen for three years by 
the school directors. In cities or boroughs there are boards of directors, one for each 
ward, having charge of the financial interests of the schools, the purchase, repair, &c., 
of school-houses, and boards of control, which manage everything else; but wherever 
the boards of directors of all the wards in a city convey the school property to the board 
of controllers, the city or borough is to form a single school district under the board of 
control, and three members are to be chosen from each ward. In cities or boroughs with 
over 5,000 inhabitants, superintendents (under a law of 1881) may be appointed by the 
school directors for a term of 3 years. Women are eligible to all school offices. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The schools are sustained by a State appropriation of $1,000,000 annually and an 
annual district tax of at least 13 mills on $1 of property; the tax must, in each county, 
equal its share of the State appropriation. Public schools must be taught from 5 to 10 
months in each school year and be free to all resident youth 6 to 21. Teachers must 
have certificates of fitness to teach, and (under penalty of forfeiture of pay) must make 
monthly report to the board of directors. Boards of directors must report annually to 
their county superintendents, and the latter to the State superintendent, who makes 
annual report to the State legislature. Graded schools, normal schools, ang teachers’ 
institutes are a part of the system. Evening and half-time schools are authorized; also, 
schools for deaf-mutes, these last in any district having 20,000 inhabitants and 8 or more 
deaf children of school age. Distinctions of race and color in the public schools were 
abolished by a law that took effect July 4, 1881. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
As may be seen from the preceding summary there were (with about a million and a 
half youth of school age) 931,749 enrolled in public schools, a decrease of more than 
5,000 during the year. It is not possible from the official reports to give the number in 
daily average attendance. There were 15 more public school districts and 220 more 
graded schools, the average length of term being about the same. Public school prop- 
erty increased in value by more than a million of dollars. More women were engaged 
in teaching and fewer men, the average pay of both being slightly increased. The re- 
ceipts for public school purposes increased by $752,608 and expenditure by $512,128. 
Throughout the State, exclusive of Philadelphia, which makes no report on thése 
points, the number of private ungraded schools decreased by 46, that of seminaries and 
academies increased by 20, while the attendance on both classes decreased. Drawing 
was taught in 693 more public schools, the higher branches in 82 more, and vocal music 
in 231 fewer. There were more firstclass public school-houses and more with suitable 
furniture; fewer were reported ‘‘badly ventilated,”” but more as ‘‘unfit for use.’? Im- 
provement in the quality of teaching is indicated by an increased number of teachers 
with long experience (649 more having been employed over 5 years continuously), as 
well as by the fact that 158 more had attended State normal schools and 138 more were 
graduates of such schools. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For statistics of Kindergiirten reporting, see Table V of the appendix, and for a sum- 
mary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
The school government of cities generally appears under the heading State School 
System preceding. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, under special laws, have boards of edu- 
cation which do not include the ward boards. Any city of over 5,000 inhabitants may 
by vote of the directors elect a school superintendent, who must have had skill and 
experience in teaching. Z

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
In Allegheny there was an increase during the year 1880-’81 of 113 pupils enrolled and 
of 13 in average attendance. The 205 schools were graded as primary, grammar, and 
high, the high school department having just graduated its first class, numbering 19. 
The school year was one of steady and satisfactory progress. Drawing was a regular 
branch of the course of study. Some excitement was caused, by the abolition of the 
school for colored children and the admission of such children into the schools for whites 
as at for by law, but it soon died out and no further trouble is anticipated.— (City 
report. 
Allentown reports 676 fewer pupils enrolled in public schools and 103 fewer in average 
attendance. 
Altoona reports an increased public school enrolment and average daily attendance; 
3,010 sittings for study; public school property valued at $101,620; a high school, with 
9@ pupils enrolled under 2 teachers; and 900 pupils attending private or parochial 
schools.—(Return and State report. ) ; 
In Bradford the schools were graded as primary, grammar, and high, the last having 
50 pupils under 2 teachers. About 350 pupils attended private and parochial schools.— 
(State report and return.) 
Carbondale, with a decrease of 48 in the public school enrolment, had 125 more in 
average attendance. The schools were graded as primary, grammar, and high; they 
were taught in 7 buildings affording 1,470 sittings for study and valued, with all other 
public school property, at $27,200. There was also an attendance of about 200 in 
private and parochial schools.— (Return and State report.) 
Chester reports a slight increase in enrolment, but a falling off in average attendance 
on public schools. The public schools (primary, secondary, grammar, and high) were 
taught in 9 buildings, affording 2,100 sittings for study and valued, with other school 
roperty, at $110,000. About200 pupils were attending private and parochial schools.—

Norristown teports a decrease of 78 in public school enrolment, an increase of 96 in 
average attendance; 44 schools taught 10 months in 6 buildings, affording accommoda- 
tion for 2,260 pupils; public school property valued at $164,700; and a high school with 
136 pupils enrolled and 134 in average attendance, 23 pupils having graduated in 1881. 
The superintendent considers the public schools in a satisfactory condition; teachers’ 
institutes were held twice a month and well attended; the number of children not 
attending public or private school was thought to be small, and the number of truants 
diminishing. — (Return and State and city reports. ) 
The Philadelphia statistics show a decrease of 3,356 in public school enrolment and of 
2,251 in average daily attendance. The 2,075 schools (arranged in 14 grades in primary, 
secondary, grammar, and senior departments, and including high, normal, and evening 
schools) were taught 10 months during the year, all the teachers but 77 being women. 
Public school property’ was valued at more than $6,000,000. Several new buildings 
were completed and occupied during the year, adding 23 class rooms, with seats for 1,000 
pupils. One building was in process of erection, but the necessities of the department 
far exceeded the appropriation for building, and many children were missing instruction 
for want of sufficient accommodations; it is believed that a million of dollars will be 
required during the next few years to supply sufficient school-houses for the city. The 
Central High School (for boys) enrolled 523 pupils; the Girls’ Normal, 965. There 
were 41 night schools taught ten weeks, at a cost of nearly $15,000. They were of great 
service to a large number of pupils, notwithstanding the short term, which, it is urged, 
should be lengthened to 4 months, only as many pupils being received as can be in- 
structed for that length of time by the money appropriated. The president of the board 
reports that the schools are not doing as much as they should, owing, in his opinion, to 
a lack of superintendence. He says the teachers, although poorly paid, are capable 
and faithful, and the pupils studious; but through a defective system of examinations 
and promotions the cultivation of the memory has become the objective point and the 
measure of its power and accumulation the standard of scholarship; that routine and the 
letter have been cultivated and intellectual development and moral discipline left to 
chance. As a means of remedying these evils the recommendation favoring the appoint- 
ment of a city superintendent is renewed. The special attention of the public school 
authorities has recently been drawn to industrial education. In addition to the intro- 
duction of sewing as a part of the instruction of the normal school, the board has assisted 
an effort made by Charles G. Leland to demonstrate the feasibility of making industrial 
education a part of the training of the public schools. It is admitted that this work 
cannot embrace the special arts of the trades but must be of a preparatory character, 
such as training the eye and the hand. Marked progress has been made in the teaching 
of drawing, the teachers having devoted special attention to the work of preparing them- 
selves to give instruction in this branch, particularly as applied to the industries.— (City 
report and return. ) 
Pittsburgh reports a larger public school enrolment by 149 than the previous year and

property valued at $1,900,000. The system comprised day and evening common schools, 
evening mechanical schools, and a high school. The last had normal, academic, and 
commercial departments, and enrolled 582 pupils. There were 2,336 pupils enrolled in 
the evening schools, under 32 teachers ; the average attendance, however, was only 600, 
and the cost of instruction, based on average attendance during the term of 65 evenings, 
was $4.44 per capita. The superintendent recommends the discontinuance of all except 
the mechanical schools, which were attended by a class of earnest young men, and advises 
the establishment of at least 5 of these, with a term of 6 months.— (Return and State 
and city reports. ) 2 
In Pottsville the public school enrolment decreased by 123, but the average attendance 
increased by 22. The 48 public schools were taught 10 months, by 7 men and 41 women, 
at a monthly cost of 69 cents per capita. Public school property was valued at $217,500. 
(State report. ) . 
In Reading there was an increase of 788 in the number enrolled in public schools and 
of 96 in average attendance. The 48 schools were taught 10 months in 26 school build- 
ings having 146 rooms for study and seating capacity for 7,551 pupils. The high school 
enrolled 324 pupils and had 318 in average attendance under 9 teachers. There was an 
estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools of 960.— (Return and State report. )

Shenandoah had 310 fewer pupils enrolled in public schools and 249 fewer in average 
attendance. The 28 schools (primary, grammar, and high) were taught nearly 9 months, 
at a monthly cost per capita of 59 cents. There were 80 pupils enrolled in the high 
school and 53 in average attendance. Public school property was valued at $61,000. 
An important addition made during the year to the educational facilities was the nucleus 
of a public school library.— (State and city reports. ) 
Titusville reports 353 fewer pupils enrolled in public schools and 38 fewer in average 
attendance ; 28 schools taught for 10 months in 4 buildings, affording seats for 1,632 
pupils. Public school property was valued at $64,275.— (Return and State reports. ) 
In Wilkes-Barre enrolment and average attendance are reported to have nearly doubled, 
the former having increased by 2,916, the latter by 1,595. The 68 schools were taught 
10 months, at a monthly cost of 74 cents per capita. Public school property was valued 
at $176,807.— (State report. ) 
The Williamsport public schools had 56 more pupils enrolled than during the previous 
year, and 20 more in average attendance. The schools were taught 8 months, at a 
monthly cost of 87 cents for each pupil, in 25 school buildings capable of seating 3,485. 
In the high school, 138 pupils were enrolled and 100 were in average attendance under 
4 teachers. Public school property was valued at $142,250. More was done during the 
year than ever before towards making drawing popular, and excellent progress was made 
in this branch. There were about 1,300 pupils attending private or parochial schools.

erty, at $125,000. About 260 pupils attended private and parochial schools.— (State 
report and city return. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. © 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The 10 State normal schools, according to a table in the State report, had an attendance 
during the year of 3,185 pupils in normal studies (1,864 of them men) and 270 gradu- 
ates, of whom 120 were men. The whole number of graduates since the recognition of 
these schools was 2,196: 1,145 men and 1,051 women. Thecourses of study, arranged by 
a convention of the principals under the advice of the State superintendent, are element- 
ary, classical, and scientific. Most of the students choose the first, which requires two 
years for its completion ; only 4 out of 270 graduates during the year were from the other 
two courses. These schools are not exclusively professional, but include a number of 
academic studies. They are also of a mixed character in their relations to the State, 
being public in some respects and private in others. The aid given by the State is not 
to the schools, but to the students in them and to graduates. Students who agree to 
teach in the common schools receive, in ordinary cases, 50 cents a week; and graduates 
who agree to teach in the State schools two full years may receive $50. \ The legislature 
which created these schools demands of them extensive appliances, such as grounds of

  not less than 10 acres in area and buildings to accommodate 1,000 students. Under 
this system some of the schools have become heavily involved, and their friends or the 
State will have to-assist them if they are to be kept in operation. — (State report.) 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Normal School for Girls, Philadelphia, belongs to the public school system of that 
city and prepares nearly all the city teachers. Its course of study for graduates extends 
over 3 years, but those who desire to teach must remain another year and show by 
work in the school of practice that they are able to train and control children; after this 
they receive certificates to teach in the city public schools. There were 965 pupils en- 
rolled at the close of the year and nearly 98 per cent. of those enrolled were in average 
daily attendance. It is estimated that about 60 per cent. of the pupils enrolled in this 
school graduate and that about 70 per cent. of graduates receive certificates. Since the 
establishment of the school, in 1848, there have been 6,516 students in it, of whom 2,996 
were graduated. The only change in the course of instruction during the year was the 
addition of sewing. In this branch all engaged willingly, and rapid improvement was 
made.—(City return and report.) 
Lycoming County Normal School, Muncy, had 135 students during the year (94 of them 
men) and graduated 20, all of whom engaged in teaching. The course of study extends 
over 3 years of 20 weeks cach.— (Return. ) 
The Brethren’s Normal College, Huntingdon, reporting 309 pupils in normal classes, 
presents 3 courses of study, classical, scientific, and normal English; the last, similar to 
the elementary course in the State normal schools, occupies 2 years; the scientific is 
the same as the normal English course for the first two years and then adds two years 
in Latin, German, higher mathematics, and science; and the classical is the ordinary 4 
years’ college course.— (Catalogue: ) 
Pine Grove Normal Academy, Pine Grove, reports preparatory, philosophical, and scien- 
tific courses of study, the last making some provision for the training of teachers.— 
(Catalogue. ) 
The Institute for Colored Youth, Philadelphia, having 152 pupils studying the higher 
branches, reported 50 in a normal class. 
Lewistown Academy, in its fourth year in 1881, reports more attention devoted to nor- 
mal work than formerly. There wasa teachers’ class in which careful attention was given 
to methods of instruction and government. 
The Philadelphia Training School for Kindergartners and the Centennial Kindergarten 
Training School, Philadelphia, each with a course of study extending over 1 year, had, 
respectively, 22 and 13 students; 34 graduated, of whom all but 3 engaged in teaching. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
County institutes were held, according to law, in all the 69 counties of the State. They 
remained in session from 4 to 10 days, nearly all, however, continuing 5 days, the mini- 
mum length of session required by law. The average number of members present was 
12,919, being all the members employed in teaching but 846. There were 491 instruct- 
ors and lecturers employed, at a cost of over $16,000. Of the $26,898 expended on the 
institutes, $6,395 were received from members, the remainder from county funds and 
other sources. 
District institutes also were sustained in 47 of the counties and in 12 cities and bor- 
oughs, the whole number reaching 472. These institutes are authorized (but not re- 
‘quired) by law to meet on two Saturdays of each month, which days are to be counted 
in to make the legal morith of labor required of teachers, and pay for the time spent at 
the institutes is to be continued. The cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Altoona 
have special laws regarding institutes. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
The chief educational journal in the State, the Pennsylvania School Journal, 2 monthly 
published at Lancaster, was in its twenty-ninth volume during 1881. Being the official 
organ of the department of education, it affords teachers much valuable information on 
general educational topics as well as full reports of educational associations in the State. 
Other educational journals are The Educational Review, Pittsburgh (a consolidation 
of The Allegheny Teacher, The Educational Voice, and The Teachers’ Advocate), The 
Teacher, Philadelphia, The Student, Westtown, and three papers published by the In- 
dian School at Carlisle, The Morning Star, The School News, and Eadle Keahtah Toh. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
Outside of Philadelphia there were 2,240 public schools in which some of the higher 
branches were taught, an increase ‘of 82 over 1879-'80. Of these, 120 were in the 24
-P-A-G-E-499
  
PENNSYLVANIA. 221 
cities and boroughs reporting (an increase of 3) and 2,120 in the 65 counties reporting (an 
increase of 79). There is no information given in the report of the State superintendent 
as to the condition and progress of these schools. The president of the Philadelphia 
school board, in speaking of the Boys’ Central High and the Girls’ Normal Schools in that 
city (which train many in high school studies who do not become teachers), reiterates 
the complaint against the ‘‘quota’’ system of admission to these schools. Promotions 
are not based on merit, but on a representation from all the grammar and consolidated 
schools whose pupils reach a medium standard of qualification; this often compels pupils 
of superior scholarship and ability in some schools to give way to those from other schools 
who are greatly inferior. The remedy urged, but as yet refused, is the adoption of a 
competitive examination as the basis of admission. More room was called for to meet 
the large increase in applications for admission to the Boys’ Central High School. An 
addition to the Girls’ Normal School building was also recommended, so that the depart- 
ment of practice might be enlarged by a primary and secondary school for boys, inasmuch 
as female teachers thoroughly qualified for managing girls sometimes fail when placed 
over a class of boys. The average attendance of the Boys’ Central High School was 521; 
that of the Girls’ Normal School, 944; in both, 1,465. None were graduated from the 
Central High School in 1881.— (State and city reports. ) 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academies, and preparatory departments ot 
colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix, and summaries of them in 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Of the 27 institutions for superior instruction in Pennsylvania appearing in Table 
IX, all but 4 present arrangements for preparatory training, the exceptions being La- 
fayette College, Easton (Presbyterian), Haverford College, Haverford (Friends), Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (non-sectarian), and Lehigh University, South 
Bethlehem (Protestant Episcopal), which confine themselves exclusively to collegiate 
work. All the colleges had classical collegiate courses of 4 years, generally of fair 
grade, and most of them had scientific courses (see p. 222). Lehigh University allowed 
students to select special studies from the general courses; 4 had arrangements for 
military drill and tactics; Swarthmore College (Friends) had a ‘“‘literary’’ course of 
4 years in modern languages, English ‘literature, &c.; several had normal courses, 
and several others, commercial courses; Pennsylvania Military Academy, Lafayette, 
Haverford, and Muhlenberg Colleges, the University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh Uni- 
versity, and the State College made provision for definite studies after graduation. 
Lehigh required such studies for the degrees of M. A., PH. D. and D. Ss. to be pursued 
under direction of its faculty for 2 years and to be followed by an examination and a 
thesis. Lafayette required an examination and thesis for the degree of PH. D. Haver- 
ford required non-resident graduates who were candidates for the degree of M. A. or M. S. 
to pursue an indicated thorough graduate course for 3 years and then to pass a satisfac- 
tory examination, but resident graduates are admitted to the examination after a shorter 
period of study, at the discretion of the faculty; while the higher degrees of PH. D. and 
SCI. D. could only be obtained by the masters of arts and sciences thus made, after fur- 
ther examination of a high character. 
For the statistics of institutions of this class, see Table IX of the appendix; for asum- 
mary of their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
In Table VIII of the appendix may be found a list of sixteen schools that have been 
organized for the superior instruction of young women exclusively, with such statistics 
as have been received from them; a summary is given in a corresponding table in the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. Nine of these schools hold charters from the 
State. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Pennsylvania State College, State College, answering to the colleges of agricult- 
ure and mechanic arts in other States, had, in 1881, as previously, a general scientific 
course of 4 years, branching off from which for the last 2 years were technical courses in 
agriculture, natural history, chemistry and physics, and civil engineering ; provision was 
also made for special study. Similar courses existed in the Pardee Scientific Depart-  
-P-A-G-E-500
  222 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ment of Lafayette College, Easton; Western University of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, since 
temporarily removed to Allegheny; Lehigh University, South Bethlehem, and Swarth- 
more College, Swarthmore. Lehigh also had a course of 4} years in mining and metal- 
lurgy and one of 2 years in astronomy for graduates, as well as other graduate courses. 
The Towne Scientific School of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 1880-’81 
provided 6 courses in chemistry and mineralogy, geology and mining, civil engineering, 
mechanical engineering, drawing and architecture, and preparation for medical study; 
these courses now occupy each 3 years, following 2 years of preparatory work in mathe- 
matical, scientific, and English studies, a year of work having been added in 1881. The 
Franklin Institute, Spring Garden Institute, and Wagner Free Institute of Science, all 
in Philadelphia, cultivated the same field of instruction in practical sciences, the three 
having libraries and lectures to aid the working classes and others in the study of me- 
chanics, engineering, telegraphy, and other branches, and giving some instruction in handi- 
crafts and industries. Schools for mechanical, free hand, and architectural drawing aided 
in this instruction, the Spring Garden Institute, at least, keeping open a day as well as a 
weekly evening school, with encouraging results. There were also practice shops,in which 
experienced workmen taught the use of mechanical tools employed in filing, drilling, turn- 
ing, forging, reaming, key fitting, &c. For ladies there were lessons in cookery. 
Through the liberality of Mr. Joseph Wharton, of Philadelphia, a new ‘School of 
Finance and Economy’? was founded in 1881, in connection with the University of 
Pennsylvania, with an endowment said to be of $100,000 and with a course of 3 years; 
it is designed to afford facilities for the study of the financial, economical, industrial, 
and legal principles involved in the current problems of business life. Thirteen stu- 
dents were enrolled for the first year. 
In the University at Lewisburg a new study has been introduced and required in the 
classical and scientific courses: anthropology is taught with the aid of illustrative mate- 
rial, ‘‘the object of which is to convey correct ideas upon the nature and origin of man, 
in opposition to erroneous theories of his relationship to the brute creation and his par- 
ticipation in its destiny.’’—(Letter from president. ) 
For statistics of scientific schools reported, see Table X of the appendix; for a sum- 
mary of such statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.— There were 17 theological schools and classes in the State reported for 
1880-81, of which 15 had a 3 years’ course, requiring for admission a collegiate diploma 
or other evidence of preliminary training. Of these 15, 2 were Presbyterian: the West- 
ern Theological Seminary, Allegheny, and the theological department of Lincoln Uni- 
versity, Lincoln; 3 were Roman Catholic: the theological course in St. Vincent College, 
Beatty’s, the Philadelphia Theological Seminary of St. Charles Porromeo, Overbrook, and 
the Augustinian Monastery of St. Thomas of Villanova; 2 were Reformed Church: the 
theological department of Ursinus College, Freeland, and the Theological Seminary of 
the Reformed Church in the United States, Lancaster; 3 were Evangelical Lutheran: 
the Theological Seminary of the General Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
the United States, Gettysburg, the Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church, Philadelphia, and the Missionary Institute, Selinsgrove. Other denominations 
were represented by single institutions, as follows: The Divinity School of the Protest- 
ant Episcopal Church, Philadelphia; the Meadville Theological Seminary, Meadville 
(Unitarian); Crozer Theological Seminary, Upland (Baptist); the Theological Seminary 
of the United Presbyterian Church (Allegheny); the Moravian Theological Seminary, 
Bethlehem; the biblical elective course in Dickinson College, Carlisle (Methodist Epis- 
copal), and a similar course in Waynesburg College (Cumberland Presbyterian). 
The schools at Lancaster and Gettysburg, in addition to other requirements, admit all 
ona 6 months’ probation, while the Meadville school had preparatory and graduate 
courses. The Gettysburg school reported property valued at $60,000, a fund of $80,000, 
with an income of $4,200; while the Meadville school reported property valued at 
$30,000, a fund of $157,000, with an income of $8,700, and $23,297 in gifts and bequests 
during the year. The Augustinian Monastery, near Philadelpha, is the mother house, 
novitiate, and studium of the order in the United States. 
The total number of instructors in the foregoing schools was 68; students, 511. For 
more detailed statistics of the theological schools reporting, see Table XI of the appen- 
dix, and a summary of this in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal.—The law department of the University of Pennsylvania in 1880-’81 reported 5 
professors and instructors and 141 students, of whom about one-third had received a 
degree in letters or science; 49 were graduated from its 2 years’ course of 34 weeks each. 
The qualifications for graduation are attendance on the full course of instruction both 
by lectures and examinations, the preparation of an essay on some legal subject, and 
the passage of an examination. Two prizes of $50 and $25 are awarded for the best and

of common pleas and orphans’ court of Philadelphia is acquired by the fact of gradua- 
tion from this school, but before becoming entitled to register as a student of law the 
candidate for admission must passa preliminary examination conducted by the courts of 
Philadelphia County in all the branches ofa good English education. 
Medical.—There were 5 medical schools (all in Philadelphia) reporting for 1880-’81, 
against 4 the previous year, 4 being regular and 1 homeopathic. The medical depart- 
ment of the University of Pennsylvania (regular), organized in 1765, had 46 professors, 
lecturers, demonstrators, and assistants, with 375 students, of whom 115 graduated. It 
required a three years’ graded course of 22 weeks yearly, and provided gratuitous optional 
instruction during 14 weeks. Since 1880 it has required for admission a preliminary ex- 
amination for those who are without evidence of suitable literary qualifications and is 
gradually raising the standard of this examination. Jefferson Medical College (regular), 
organized in 1825, had 15 instructors, and graduated 205; there were 609 students in 
the lower class. While still preserving its 2 years’ ungraded lecture course, the annual 
term was lengthened to 24 weeks. No examination was required for admission; for 
aduation the usual 3 years of study were required. ‘The Woman’s Medical College 
Caeati), organized and chartered in 1850, reported a faculty and corps of auxiliary in- 
structors of 19, with 100 students, graduating 19. It has since 1880 required a 3 years’ 
graded course of 20 weeks each year, presenting also an optional spring course for 1881. 
No preliminary examination is required except for those coming in on scholarship founda- 
tions. For graduation the requirements are those common to schools of this grade. The 
Medico-Chirurgical College (regular) began its first session April 4, 1881, with 13 pro- 
fessors and instructors, and reported 31 students. It announces a 3 years’ graded course 
of 24 weeks each year and requires preparation in English studies, natural science, and 
Latin and Greek. The instruction given is in a marked degree individual, and it is the 
intention to graduate only thoroughly instructed students. The Hahnemann Medical 
College (homeopathic), organized in 1848, for 1881 reported 19 professors and instructors, 
with 199 students; it graduated 83. For matriculation, students must present evidence 
of qualification for the study of medicine, and for graduation must have attended the 3 
years’ course and present a satisfactory thesis. A supplementary course, during the 
spring months, afforded students taking a 3 years’ course facilities for duplicating their 
study of subjects which might have been imperfectly attended to and for those attending 
2 years an opportunity to complete the full 3 years’ course within 2 years. There was 
also a graduate course for such old school physicians as desired to study homeopathy. 
Dentistry continued to be taught in 3 schools, all in Philadelphia: (1) The dental de- 
partment in the University of Pennsylvania (1878) in 1881 had 28 professors, demon- 
strators, and instructors, with 110 students and 47 graduates. For matriculation, a 
preliminary examination in English studies wes to be required after 1881; while, for 
graduation, the students must have attended the regular graded course of 2 years, have 
studied 2 years under a private instructor, and present a satisfactory thesis and speci- 
mens of dental work. (2) Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery (1855) reported, for 
1880-’81, 35 professors, demonstrators, and clinical instructors, with 132 students, grad- 
uating 64. Attendance on 2 full winter courses of 20 weeks each and 2 years’ study under 
a private teacher are required, the spring and fall sessions being optional. No prelim- 
inary examination was required. (3) Philadelphia Dental College (1863) presents the 
same requirements as the Pennsylvania College, except that it offers spring and fall terms 
as an equivalent for the required 2 years of private instruction. 
Two colleges of pharmacy reported in 1880-’81: the Philadelphia College (1821), with 
3 professors and instructors and 350 students, graduating 140 in 1881, and the Pitts- 
burgh College (1878), with 3 professors, 20 students, and 5 graduates. In both, the re- 
quirements were 2 lecture courses of 20 weeks each and a 4 years’ apprenticeship to the 
drug business.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Philadelphia (1821), reported 23 
teachers, with 402 pupils, during the year ending December 31, 1881, and 319 at the 
beginning of 1882; the average time spent in the school is about 5 years. Of the whole 
number, 292 were supported by the State, 20 by New Jersey, 1 by Delaware, and the 
others by Philadelphia, Crozer scholarship, and friends. No information is given as 
to school work, except that instruction in articulation had proved satisfactory for chil- 
dren between 6 and 10. ' In the various industries good progress had been made, espe- 
cially in lithography, tailoring, shoemaking, and sewing. The work in the sewing de-

partment required 5,089 yards of dress goods, 2,912 of muslin, 1,469 of shirting, 1,268 
of towelling, 1,017 of lining for garments, and 284 of flannel. The figures show that of 
the 77 admitted during the year only 11 were born deaf, and that of the 66 made so by 
disease 11 were due to scarlet and 18 to spotted fever; deafness occurred in 36 cases before 
3 years of age and in 20 cases between 3 and 5. Financially the year was prosperous. 
Two legacies of $5,000 and $3,000, respectively, were given, while the legislature, having 
for two years refused appropriations, at its last session not only made an appropriation, 
but en the debt of the institution incurred in supporting itself for two years.— (Re- 
port. 
The Western Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, Turtle 
Creek (1876), reported 7 instructors, including the principal, and 3 in the domestic de- 
partment, including the physician, with 119 pupils and an average attendance of 96. Of 
the whole number attending during the year, 46 were born deaf, the other 73 were made 
so by disease, 62 while under 3 years of age, 15 by cerebro-spinal meningitis, and 12 by 
scarlet fever. In the school department the good work done was seen in the improved 
intelligence and conduct of the pupils. Articulation and lip reading were taught to 
such as were likely to be benefited thereby. Applications for admission were largely in 
excess of room and enlargement was strongly urged. No trades were taught. The year 
is said to have been a prosperous one.— (Report. 
Under an act of the legislature of 1876, 3 day schools for the deaf and dumb were 
established at Erie, Philadelphia, and Scranton; the 2 former, taught on the articulation 
plan, had 32 pupils; while the last, taught by a former pupil of the Pennsylvania in- 
stitution on the manual labor plan, had 15 to 20 pupils.— (Report of Pennsylvania 
institution. ) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Philadelphia (1833), 
had 30 teachers and assistants and 192 pupils December 1, 1881. The literary depart- 
ment comprises a fair grammar school course and some advanced branches of the high 
school, raised letters being constantly used. The musical department includes instru- 
mental and vocal music, organ, piano, and orchestra, with piano tuning and repairing. 
The trades taught were brush, broom, and mattress making, cane seating, carpet weav- 
ing, Indian basket work, machine, hand, and mattress sewing, crocheting, knitting, 
bead work, &c., amounting, in value of work during the year, to $6,299. For the sup- 
port of 145 pupils for the year, the State gave $43,500. Real estate, including buildings 
and personal property, was valued at $205,000. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-Minded Children, Elwyn, since its es- 
tablishment in 1852, has admitted 1,040 children, of whom 30 or 40 per cent. have been 
improved and returned to their homes. There were 383 inmates for the year ending 
September 30, 1881, of whom 60 were admitted during the year and 28 discharged, 
leaving 355, against 323 the previous year. Of these, 191 were supported by the State, 
50 by New Jersey, 1 by Delaware, 16 by Philadelphia, the others by guardians, &c. In 
the school department there were 173 and in the manual 103, while in the asylum and 
nursery there were 79. During the year two new buildings were erected, one in which 
systematic instruction was given in laundry work to groups of feeble-minded children, 
the other a large school building. The State also appropriated $60,000 for the imme- 
diate erection of two asylum buildings for the use of hopeless cases.— (Report of State 
board of charities and State report.) 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
In the system by which the State provides for the support and education of orphan 
and destitute children of soldiers, the law from 1864 required that the children entering 
at 5 years of age must leave at 16. Since the inauguration of these schools, about 7,500 
have been honorably discharged at 16, and some 2,000 others ‘‘on order,’’ before reaching 
16, leaving 2,600 in the different schools in 1881. Of these schdols, which in 1879-’80 
numbered 18, only 7 reported for the current year. In these, 6,635 had been instructed 
since their organization, while during the year there were 1,612 inmates, with 126 
teachers. The school course embraces the common English branches, including draw- 
ing and instrumental and vocal music. Five report 2,360 volumes in their libraries. The 
industries common to most of them were farming, gardening, and some of the most 
useful trades for the boys, while the girls were trained in general housework and in 
some cases in flower raising. Of those who have gone out, 90 per cent. have become 
good citizens, earning a livelihood in respectable callings, including the leading profes- 
sions.— (Returns and Pennsylvania School Journal.) 
Girard College for Orphans, Philadelphia (1848), for 1880-81 reported 2,776 inmates 
since its foundation, and 878, with 59 teachers, during the year. The age for admission
-P-A-G-E-503
  PENNSYLVANIA. 225 
is between 6 and 10. The age for leaving is 18, when the student must be bound out 
to some trade, with an outfit worth $50. For school instruction the classes are grouped 
into larger divisions, corresponding to primary, grammar, and high schools in the city 
system. At suitable age, the boys are to work iniron and use machinery. The perma- 
nent fund is $9,383,437 and afforded for 1881 an income of $867,879. The school has 
a library of 7,902 volumes; increase during the year, 375.— (Return and circular.) 
The Educational Home and the Lincoln Institution, both in Philadelphia, while separate 
in management, were connected with respect to the work they undertook; the Home re- 
ceived children at 2 years of age and at 12 transferred them to the Lincoln Institution. 
During the year the Home had 211 inmates, of whom 82 were soldiers’ orphans. At the 
proper age 17 were transferred to the Lincoln Institution, which reported 95 enrolled. 
During 1880 the Lincoln Institution purchased a farm near Sioux Falls, Dak., called the 
Meade farm, where it proposes to give its boys a chance to study farming, herding, and 
mechanics, with a view to healthful self support.— (Reports. ) 
The Burd Orphan Asylum of St. Stephen’s Church, Philadelphia, Protestant Episcopal 
(1862), among the noble institutions of the city, was founded and endowed by the late 
Mrs. Eliza H. Burd with $500,000. It receives white female orphan children from 4 to 
8 years of age, first of Philadelphia, then of the State, and then others, except that in 
all cases orphan daughters of clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church have pre- 
cedence. The asylum consists of a group of buildings located ona, lot of 45 acres, partly 
within the city limits. The inmates receive a good English education, with instruc- 
tion in music, drawing, embroidery, sewing, typewriting, shorthand, housework, cook- 
ery, &c. Pupils must leave at 18 years of age, and are provided with an outfit and 
$25 in cash. Since its foundation 135 had been received; there were 60 during the year 
under 7 teachers. Its benefits are gratuitous, there being a permanent fund of $400,000; 
income for the year $17,938 and expenses $16,458. A library of 4,000 volumes is re- 
ported.— (Circular and return.) 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
Two distinctively reformatory schools reported for 1880-’81, viz, the Pennsylvania Re- 
form School, Morganza (1850), and the Night School House of Correction, Philadelphia, 
(1874). The former had 42 teachers and admitted children between 7 and 21 years of 
age; it enrolled 307 inmates for the year, of whom only 153 could read and write when 
committed, while of the remaining 154 it is said that 40 learned to read and 85 to write 
after committal. The common school branches, including music, were taught, while 
the industrial training was in general farm work, gardening, and domestic work, includ- 
ing laundry. The trades taught were baking, saddlery, harness and shoe making, tai- 
loring, carpet weaving, and painting. Of the 3,601 committed since 1850, 80 per cent. 
had become orderly and useful citizens. Homes are provided for the homeless. Total 
cost for the year, $34,023, or $111 per capita; total earnings, $2,837.— (Return. ) 
The Night School House of Correction, under municipal control, is designed for adults 
who have sunk into degradation and are committed for short periods for restraint and 
instruction. It has 3 or 4 teachers who give instruction in the ordinary English studies 
as well as in morals. The number in school during the year was 120, of whom 6 learned 
to read and 8 to write.— (Return.) 
Besides these, 23 institutions reported which combine the support and education of 
orphan and destitute children with industrial or reformatory training. Of these, 12 
were incorporated; 6 were in Philadelphia and the others in different parts of the State; 
7,055 children had been admitted since organization; there were 1,107 inmates during 
the year,under 115 teachers. Inall but 1 the common English studies were taught, and, 
in nearly all, music, and, in all but 5, industries proper to the age and sex of inmates. 
On discharge those not having homes or friends were indentured to trades or placed in 
good families, Four report permanent funds, amounting in all to $242,600, while 7 had 
libraries with a total of 5,150 volumes. The parents of most of the inmates were native 
born.— (Returns. ) 
TRAINING OF INDIANS. 
The Training School for Indians, Carlisle (1879), under the control of the General Gov- 
ernment, reported for the year ending October, 1881, 295 Indian pupils, from 24 different 
tribes, of whom 99, from 10 different tribes, were added during the year. In the school 
work the chief point for the first two years is the mastery of the English language. For 
the more advanced, the aim is a practical knowledge of the elementary English branches, 
in which, especially in spelling, writing, and arithmetic, progress was remarkable, 
while in the several branches of industry the improvement is said to have been more 
than satisfactory. The first annual examination was held June 15, 1881, at which nearly 
800 visitors were present, among whom were prominent educators from all parts of the 
country, who expressed great satisfaction at the results attained.— (Report of Indian Com- 
missioner. ) ;

summary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
ART EDUCATION. 
The School of Design for Women, Philadelphia, held its annual reception June 10, 
1881, in its new building, on North Broad street. It had about 250 students, 14 of 
whom graduated. The work displayed by the students included oil and water painting, 
silk decorations, designs for various purposes, wood engraving, landscape drawing, china 
painting, crayon and India ink drawing, still life in oil and water colors, and a variety 
of other art work. Many specimens were the result of the year’s study, showing fine 
taste and great proficiency. 
During the summer of 1881 classes in industrial and decorative art were taught in 
one of the public schools of Philadelphia, under the direction of Mr. Charles G. Leland, 
at first in the evening, but soon followed by classes in the afternoon. As the result of 3 
months’ work Mr. Leland’ reported to the school committee: ‘‘We are quite capable, 
even now, of producing work which would meet with ready sale,’’ and he added that in 
a few days he could qualify all the scholars to fill orders for ordinary sheet brass work and 
wood panels suitable for common decoration. _The board of education authorized Mr. 
Leland to introduce into the public schools instruction covering the rudiments of tile 
painting, leather work, wood carving, sheet metal work, etching, papier m&ché work, 
glass work, pottery, painting, modelling in clay, art needle work, stencilling, illumina- 
tion, and of a number of other art industries. 
The Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, Philadelphia (1875), reports an 
encouraging advance toward the position of usefulness which it was projected to fill. 
With the aid of $10,000 from the city the museum was opened to the public and during 
the year was visited by 128,729 persons. The School of Art made steady improvement, 
haying a 3 years’ course in which 62 students had received instruction in 23 different 
occupations during the year. 
The School of Design for Women, Pittsburgh, which reported for 1879-’80, sends no 
report for 1881; nor does the Art School at Meadville, opened in 1880. 
TRAINING IN ORATORY. 
The National School of Elocution and Oratory, Philadelphia (1873), admits both sexes 
and provides courses in elocution and oratory. In 1880 there were 219 students, under 
19 instructors. 
  TRAINING IN MUSIC. 
The Musical College aad Pennsylvania Normal Music School, Freeburgh, Prof. F. G. 
Moyer conductor, continued to offer to both sexes its advantages for training in all 
branches of vocal and instrumental music. Its yearly conventions have been largely 
attended and with increased interest. Other musical schools are Madame Seiler’s School 
of Vocal Art and Instrumental Music, Philadelphia, and the Philadelphia Conservatory of 
Music, from which no report has been received. 
KITCHEN GARDEN INSTRUCTION. 
Classes in kitchen garden training are said to have been formed in Philadelphia in 
1881 of which no official report has been received at this Bureau. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-seventh annual session of the State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Washington, Pa., July 26-28, 1881, President Newlin in the chair. Superintendent E. 
W. Mouck gave the address of welcome. He was followed by the president, who con- 
gratulated the friends of education that the advance in the respectability, influence, 
and efficiency of teaching had been marked and rapid; that compensation had been in- 
* creased; that the work had been made more attractive by classification and grading, as 
well as by improvement in school architecture, furniture, and apparatus, so that some 
of the best graduates of the highest schools of learning were entering upon teaching in 
preference to law or medicine. By way of improvement he suggested that the disci- 
plinary value of the common branches was underrated in the haste to reach the higher 
studies; that the curricula of the common and high schools were too crowded to secure 
thoroughness in any branch. After a brief discussion, which developed some difference 
of views on this subject, a paper was read by Prof. John C. Dolan on ‘‘ Mental science 
as the basis of teaching.’’ It discussed at length the subject of teaching from a scien- 
tific standpoint, and assumed that before the art of teaching can command the respect 
which it ought to deserve it must be based upon the principles of mental science, and
-P-A-G-E-505
  PENNSYLVANIA. 227 
that teachers must understand those principles so as to apply them in the work of the 
school room. The evening session was opened by a paper by Rev. J. B. Young, of Al- 
toona, showing the widespread circulation of vicious literaturé and its shocking results 
in producing youthfulcrime. Then came a lecture by Rev. C. T. Steck, of Indiana, show- 
ing the folly and injustice of hero worship when given simply to eminence or success. 
The heroic quality slumbers in the masses of ordinary humanity, but some high occasion 
may call it out, and it is often exemplified in common life. The paper read on Wednes- 
day morning by Prof. E. O. Lyte was a report from a committee appointed to consider 
teachers’ studies, examinations, and degrees. Teachers’ certificates were too plenty and 
too cheap; such astandard should be required as will give them real professional value; a 
more definite statement of the work required in the professional studies was demanded; 
the scientific and classical courses in the normal school should be dropped, and the ele- 
mentary enlarged by one year’s studies; this course should be carefully graded and an- 
nual examinations should be held. It was recommended that a State certificate, good 
for one year, be given those who complete the first year; one good for 3 years, to those 
who complete the 2 years’ course; while those completing the 3 years’ course should 
receive a graduate diploma, with the degree of bachelor of teaching, giving authority to 
teach 5 years without further examination. After 3 years of successful teaching, the 
degree of master of teaching should be conferred on the holder of a bachelor’s degree 
and no further examination should be required. 
Prof. J. A. Cooper addressed the association on appliances and apparatus for element- 
ary teaching, and how to obtainthem. This was followed by a paper by Dr. J. H. Shu- 
maker, emphasizing some important lessons for teachers 6f our public schools. growing 
out of the relation of innocent pupils to crime in school. In the afternoon Hon. J. Q. 
Stewart read a paper on ‘‘ Needed legislation.’’ The points discussed were: (1) to extend 
the annual school term to 6 months; (2) to permit boards of directors to provide text 
books out of the district funds and furnish them to the pupils free of cost for use in the 
schools; (3) to change the mode of electing county superintendents and to provide forthe 
payment of the necessary expenses incurred by directors in attending the triennial conven- 
tion; (4) to recommend to school boards to establish graded schools in the country districts 
of the State. This was followed by a plea for the study of esthetics in the public schools, 
by Dr. N. C. Shaeffer, who contended that this is just the study which we as a people are 
‘in danger of neglecting. True culture is fourfold, physical, intellectual, moral, and 
esthetic. Aisthetic culture should crown the intellectual training of our schools. 
Wednesday evening was spent in the ‘‘ wonder land”’ of the Yellowstone National Park. 
The lecturer, Prof. W. J. Marshall, of Massachusetts, gave an entertaining history of the 
discovery and exploration of this wonderful region and illustrated the curiosities of the 
park by viewson a screen. Superintendent S. J. Craighead read a paper on ‘‘ Local insti- 
tutes,’’ in the consideration of which the leading idea was that though not a panacea for 
all the troubles in school work, yet there is a place for them in every locality where there 
are energetic teachers; that when established they should receive the encouragement of 
every intelligent citizen; and that teachers and director should participate in the discus- 
sions. Prof. L. H. Durling followed with a paper on the high school question. The com- 
mon school, it was argued, does not furnish the education required to prepare our youth 
for citizenship in a free republic: a taste for pure literature should also be cultivated and 
there should be education in skilled labor. Our boys and girls have a right to demand 
an education going beyond even the grammar school, until they are able to observe accu- 
rately and think closely. The high school is the crown of the common school system. 
Prof. Luckey, of Pittsburgh, then exhibited his ‘‘lightning calculator’? method by a 
class of 15 pupils averaging 10} years of age, who added, subtracted, multiplied, and di- 
vided large examples in 43 seconds or less. This, he stated, was not phenomenal, as any 
child of average ability with proper training could do the same work. 
The paper by A. M. Gow, which followed, dealt at length with mistakes in the pres- 
ent schools, the most important of which were believed to be the following: That itis a 
mistake to offer prizes as incentives in the schools, which should have no other purpose 
than to educate in the duties of citizenship; to have exhibitions at the close of every 
term; to spend years in studies which are not preparatory to still higher ones; to gradu- 
ate girls from the high and normal schools at 15 or 16 years of age and then allow 
them to teach; to suppose that a person is fit for a teacher because he can pass an exam- 
ination in text book knowledge; and that the schools can be kept up to any degree of 
efficiency without the codperation and support of the people. Considerable discussion 
followed. Miss Lelia E. Patridge then gave an account of what she had seen in the 
Quincy schools. She was followed by Dr. Wickersham, who said he had just returned 
from the meeting of the National Educational Association at Atlanta, Ga., and who gave 
an account of the awakened interest in the South in free public schools. Dr. E. E. 
Higbee, State superintendent of public instruction, then addressed the association on 
the question ‘‘ How shall we secure and keep active inour Commonwealth the best quali- 
 
-P-A-G-E-506
  228 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
fied class of common school teachers??” He said: ‘We have the best material, but we need 
improvement in our system of educating teachers. The high school should lead to the 
college course, so that the teachers should have thorough scholarship; then they must 
thoroughly master the art of imparting knowledge. We need for this 1 or 2 real normal 
schools, into which may enter the graduates of our colleges, academies, high schools, and 
our present normal schools, where students may be thoroughly grounded in the phi- 
losophy, theory, and art of teaching, and out of which, in a year or two, they may pass 
with a degree given by the State that shall give the dignity of proven scholarship to the 
positions they take in the schools.’’? Memorial addresses on Professors S. S. Haldeman, 
Andrew Burtt, and J. S. Ermentrout followed, and officers for the ensuing year having 
been chosen the association adjourned. The meeting was one of the largest ever held. 
EDUCATIONAL BENEFACTIONS. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 
The following benefactions were reported for 1881: Mr. Joseph Wharton, an esteemed 
merchant of Philadelphia, gave (it is said) $100,000 to the University of Pennsylvania 
as an endowment for the Wharton School of Finance and Economy; Lafayette College 
received from John I. Blair, of Blairstown, N. J., $40,000 for the endowment of a 
presidential chair; Haverford College, from various sources, $7,500 for general expenses 
and care of grounds; Swarthmore College, from Samuel Willets, of New York, $3,100 
for construction of additional, waterworks; Thiel College, from various benefactors, 
$2,000 for free scholarships; and Muhlenberg College, from the trustees of Allentown 
Academy, $800 for permanent scholarships.

230 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The general supervision of the public schools is vested in a State board of education, 
consisting of the governor and lieutenant governor as members ex officio and of 6 others 
appointed by the?legislature for 3 years, with annual change of one-third. A commis- 
sioner of public schools, chosen annually by the board, acts as its secretary. For each 
town there is a school committee of 3 or more members elected for 3 years, with annual 
change of one-third. A superintendent of the schools of the town is electedat the annual 
meeting, or, in failure of such election, is appointed by the school committee. For each 
school district 1 or 3 trustees must be chosen by the people for 1 year. Adjoining school 
districts in the same or in adjoining towns may establish a school of higher grade and 
may elect a board of trustees consisting of one member from each district so associating. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all persons residing in the State; youth over 15 are not 
to be excluded on that account and youth under 5 may be admitted at the discretion of 
the school committee. For supporting schools $90,000 are annually paid out of the in- 
come of a permanent school fund and from other money in the treasury, which sum is 
for the payment of teachers only. Of this amount $63,000 are apportioned among the 
several towns in proportion to the number of children under 15 years, and the remaining 
$27,000 in proportion to the number of school districts in each town. No town may re- 
ceive any part of such State appropriation unless it raise by tax an equal amount for 
the support of the public schools. The sum of $3,000 is yearly appropriated, on the 
same condition, for apparatus and works of reference for public schools; towns not di- 
vided into districts may, on application, receive $50 for this purpose; districts, not to ex- 
ceed $20. Towns may vote such sums as they deem necessary for the support of schools, 
purchase of sites, erection and repair of school-houses, and for the establishment and 
maintenance of school libraries. Any town having established a free public library 
may appropriate a sum not exceeding 20 cents on each $1,000 of its ratable property for 
its maintenance, and may receive donations for the same; the State board of education 
may cause to be paid annually to each free public library a sum not exceeding $50 for 
the first 500 volumes included in such library and $25 for each additional 500. A sum 
not exceeding $500 is to be annually paid for the holding of teachers’ institutes, and 
$300 for publishing and distributing educational publications and providing lectures on 
educational topics. Teachers, to obtain employment, must have a certificate of qualifi- 
cation from the town school authorities or from the trustees of the State Normal School. 
A penalty is imposed on employers or parents for the employment of children under 12 
years in or about manufacturing establishments, or for the employment of those between 
12 and 15 who have not attended school at least 3 months during the year preceding. The 
education of deaf-mutes,! blind, and feeble-minded youth is provided for. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics given by the State commissioner show that an increase of 804 in youth 
of school age was accompanied by an increase in funds of $24,514; there were 8 more 
schools, 6 for day and 2 for evening pupils; 170 more teachers ; 78 more teachers had 
been trained in normal schools; and there was a considerable addition to the value of 
school property; finally, the work of school inspection intrusted to town committees 
and district trustees was more satisfactorily performed. Yet, with this readiness of 
school officers and people to improve the means of instruction, it appears that (although 
there was an increase in enrolment of 386), the average number on the school lists was 
120 less and the average daily attendance 279 less in the day schools, with 246 fewer in ~ 
the evening schools. The increase of absence from the schools is deplored by the State 
board, which reports 12,730 youth of school age as not attending at all, an increase of 
451, while 2,551 attended for less time than the 12 weeks required by law; nearly 29 
per cent. of the school population was not in school. To the evils inseparable from the 
district system the board chiefly ascribes these poor results, and it is recommended that 
municipalities desiring to do so may be allowed to abolish the district system. A more 
effective compulsory attendance law and fuller and better local superintendence are also 
advocated.

a The statistics for Lincoln and Pawtucket are from the State report, the others from returns. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Lincoln reported to the commissioner of public Schools 12 school buildings, valued, 
with sites, furniture, &c., at $79,000, these buildings containing 29 graded and 4 ungraded 
schools, with a session of 199 days. In response to the offer of assistance made by the 
State in 1880 to all towns and districts in purchasing libraries and apparatus, this town 
raised $250, to which the State added $180, so that every school-house has the beginning 
of a library.— (State report, 1881.) 
Newport reports an increase in children of school age, in enrolment, and in average 
attendance; the schools are classified as primary, intermediate, grammar, and high, be- 
sides evening and ungraded schools, and were taught 196 days. Music and drawing are 
taught by special teachers. The high school offers 4 years’ classical and scientific courses 
and enrolled 133 pupils, with 95 per cent. in daily attendance in 1880-’81. The public 
school property, including 10 buildings used for day schools, containing 45 rooms, with 
2,181 sittings for study, was valued at $225,333. Private and parochial schools reported 
3 school buildings, with 6 rooms, 14 teachers, and 795 pupils, of whom 531 were in daily 
attendance.— (City report and return.) 
Pawtucket classed its schools as primary, intermediate, grammar, and high, and re- 
ported 40 graded and 5 ungraded schools, with a session of 200 days, taught by 53 teach- 
ers, of which number15 were normal graduates. There were also 4 evening schools for 
persons over 12 years, taught 42 evenings by 22 teachers, with 522 enrolled and 375 in 
average attendance. The receipts for all school purposes were $35,719, of which amount 
$4,506 went for permanent improvements and the remainder for current expenses. 
School property, consisting of 18 buildings, with sites, furniture, and apparatus, was 
valued at $174,000.— (State report. ) 
Providence reported a high school, with 444 in the last month of the session; 11 gram- 
mar schools, with 3,552; 35 intermediate, with 2,961; and 37 primary, with 5,246. The 
9 evening schools, with 2,227 enrolled and an average attendance of 957, had 111 teach- 
ers at the beginning of the session of 17 weeks and 87 at the close. The whole number 
of different pupils in day and evening schools was 14,194, an increase of 200. Private 
schools enrolled 3,599. The high school had a classical, an English and scientific de- 
partment, and a special department for girls. Music and drawing were taught by special 
teachers. The city expended $27,873 for sites, buildings, and furniture during the 
year, and valued its school property, including 51 school-houses, at $893,350. Disci- 
pline, the superintendent thinks, was still maintained too much by force, too little by 
moral means, though in this respect there was improvement.— (Return and State and 
city reports. ) 
Warwick estimated the value of its school property, consisting of 19 buildings, con- 
taining 25 rooms, with grounds, at $29,100. The schools were taught 192 days, by 7 
men and 23 women. One evening school, with a session of 22 evenings, enrolled 18 and 
had 12 in average attendance. The superintendent reported the schools generally in 
fair condition and making good progress.— (Return and State and city reports. ) 
Woonsocket had 31 graded schools, divided into primary, grammar, and high; 3 un- 
graded and 2 evening schools. The day schools were taught 195 days, the evening 
schools 41 evenings. The city expended during the year $2,660 for permanent improve- 
ments for its schools, and valued its school property, including 14 buildings, at $116,650. 
An enrolment of 599 was reported in private schools.— (Return and State report.)

  232 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, 
The State Normal School, Providence, has a 2 years’ course, prescribed by the board 
of education, which graduates of high schools finish in less time; it also had an advanced 
course, including ancient and modern. languages, mathematics, and natural science. 
There were 136 students, with 18 graduates, in 1880-’81; 16 of that number have since 
engaged in teaching. The principal, in his report, states that about 97 per cent. of all 
graduates of this school teach after graduation. Frequently the demand for graduates 
as teachers is greater than the supply. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Four institutes were held during the year 1880~’81 besides the Rhode Island Institute 
ot Instruction. The attendance was good and the spirit manifested commendable. The 
commissioner, assisted by Professor Bailey, of Brown University, presented the subject 
of botany in its relation to common school work at two of the institutes. Other topics 
presented were geography, elementary work in numbers, language lessons, school hygiene, 
public libraries in their relation to public schools, United States history, school polity, 
percentage, penmanship, reading, &c. Dr. J. C. Stockbridge lectured at Tiverton on 
“Veniceand Pompeii’’ and at Chepachet on ‘‘ Rome and vicinity;’’ Col. H. B. Sprague, 
of Boston, at Olneyville, on ‘‘Riches,and what constitutes them.’’ At each institute 
‘every teacher was provided with a note book and pencil. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Information as to this class of schools is generally less distinct than could be wished, 
except in the chief cities. The Rogers High School, Newport, enrolled 133 and had over 
95 per cent. of these in average attendance. A graduate course was added, involving 
attendance at 8 or more lessons a week, and at once enrolled 4 pupils. Increased atten- 
tion was given to English, and proficiency in composition was allowed the same weight 
as in mathematics and other studies. The Providence High School, with 2 courses for 
the boys and a special department for the girls, had 444 pupilsin June, 1881, and gradu- 
ated 76. South Kingston was provided with a high school through the liberality of two 
citizens. The Warren High School enrolled a new class of 25; the ratio of attendance 
to enrolment for 23 terms has averaged 96 percent. Woonsocket consolidated its classi- 
cal, scientific, and college preparatory high school courses into one course, which, how- 
ever, provides throughout for elective studies. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academies, and schools preparatory to college, 
see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and for summaries of the same, the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
BROWN UNIVERSITY. 
Brown University, Providence, continued in 1881 its 3 courses of 4 years each, one 
being the time honored classical course, leading to the degree of A.B., the other twoscien- 
tific courses. One of these includes a single ancient language, the other substitutes 
French for this. The degree conferred on graduates from either of these last is PH. B. 
In all the 3 the standards, as shown by the requirements for entrance, are well up to 
those of the best American colleges. Women are not admitted. For statistics of in- 
structors and attendance, see Table IX. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Besides the 2 scientific courses above mentioned, departments for special preparation 
in mathematical and physical sciences and their applications to industrial arts are found 
xn Brown University. One of these is a course in civil engineering, meant to cover 4 
years, though a longer or shorter course may be pursued, according to the wants and 
abilities of students. Another is a course in agriculture, which may cover the 4 years 
of the regular scientific courses, with special study of the branches of science relating 
most closely to agricultural pursuits, or may include only the required studies prepara- 
tory to a collegiate course, with chemistry and physics, botany,physiology, zodlogy, and
-P-A-G-E-511

comparative anatomy. Special lectures are given in this course on the study of soils 
and applied economic zodlogy. - 3 
PROFESSIONAL. 
No professional schools appear to have been established yet in this State. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF, PROVIDENCE. 
This school, opened in 1877 under the control of the State board of education, reported 
29 pupils receiving instruction in lip reading and the common English branches during 
1880-81. As it is simply a day school with only 4 hours’ session, no employments are 
taught. 
m EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
In 1880-81 Rhode Island paid $3,100 to the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts 
School for the Blind, South Boston, for the training of blind children sent from the 
State. 
EDUCATION IN ART. 
The Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, in a circular for 1880, offered to regu- 
lar day and evening classes instruction in free hand and mechanical drawing and in 
original designs for jewellery, tiles, wall paper, and wood carving. Advanced instruction 
was also given in painting, modelling, mechanical drawing, building construction, &c. 
The third annual exhibition, in June, 1881, is said to have showed marked improve- 
ment in the quality of the work done. The pupils numbered 150. 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Rhode Island Reform School, formerly Providence Reform School, had 168 boys 
and 21 girls under its care during the year 1881. It received 145 boys and 13 girls, and 
discharged 119 boys and 26 girls. The girls do only domestic work, while the boys 
earned $11,778 in 1881 by chair caning. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE INSTITUTE. 
The Rhode Island Institute of Instruction held its thirty-sixth annual meeting at 
Providence in January, 1881. The papers and discussions were progressive and practi- 
cal, the attendance was large and the interest enthusiastic. In the grammar and pri- 
mary department, short papers on phonetics, form, spelling, language, arithmetic, gram- 
mar, reading, and history were read by lady teachers and discussed by gentlemen in five 
minute speeches. Before the department of higher instruction Prof. T. Whiting Ban- 
croft, of Brown University, read a paper on ‘‘ English composition in the schools’? and 
Professor Williams, of that university, presented the question of ‘‘ The aim and method 
of studying foreign languages in a course of instruction.”’ 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
PROFESSOR J. LEWIS DIMAN, D. D. 
Not only the university in which he taught but also the State of which he was an 
influential citizen sustained a great loss in the death of this gentleman at Providence, 
February 3, 1881. A son of Ex-Governor Byron Diman, he was born at Bristol, R. I., May 
1, 1831; was graduated with honors at Brown University at 20 years of age, and at An- 
dover Theological Seminary 5 years afterwards, having meanwhile spent 2 years in 
European study, chiefly in Germany. On leaving Andover he became pastor of the 
First Congregational Church at Fall River, Mass., from December 9, 1856, to March 1, 
1860; then for 4 years more presided over the Harvard Church, Brookline, Mass.; and, 
thus matured, was called in the summer of 1864 to the chair of history and political 
economy at Brown, where he had studied. There he served with such efficiency and 
usefulness as professor, writer, and lecturer that at his death the Providence Journal said 
of him: ‘‘No man living in this city or State could be counted his superior.’? He was 
a contributor to the North American and other reviews; published several interesting 
addresses delivered on important occasions; issued a work on The Theistic Argument in 
1881; edited two volumes of Narragansett Club Publications relative to his favorite sub- 
ject, history, on which he also delivered a series of lectures at Johns Hopkins University, 
Baltimore. His alma mater in 1870 recognized his ability and learning by bestowing on 
him its honorary D.D.

234 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
HON. JOSHUA BICKNELL CHAPIN. 
This gentleman, a graduate of Brown University, was educated a physician, but from 
deficient hearing gave up his practice to devote himself to business. In 1859 he was 
chosen State commissioner of public schools, succeeding Hon. John Kingsbury; he held 
that position till 1861, and was again elected in 1863, holding to 1869. His reports for 
all these years were models of clearness and full of useful and practical suggestions. 
The need for parental codperation with the teachers, for frequent visits by school officers 
and others to note and to encourage their important work, for careful selection of good 
sites for school-houses, for giving to the schools fair exteriors and making provision for 
shade and ventilation, for introducing music, and for educating well the teachers for the 
primary as well as for the higher schools, were matters that he presented with great 
force. His decisions on points of school law are highly esteemed. Besides serving as 
school oe he was also for a time editor of the Rhode Island Schoolmaster (1868 
and 1869).

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of education, elected for a term of 2 years by the people at 
the general election of State officers, has general supervision of the free public schools 
and is assisted by a State board of examiners, of which he is ex officio chairman. This 
board is composed of the State superintendent and 4 members appointed by the governor 
biennially. 
For each county there are a school commissioner elected at each general election and a
-P-A-G-E-514
  236 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
eounty board of examiners, consisting of 2 members appointed by the State board of 
examiners for 2 years’ terms, with the county commissioner as chairman. 
For each school district there are 3 school trustees appointed biennially by the county 
boards of examiners to look after local educational interests, under the supervision of the 
examiners.— (School law, 1878.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF TH® SYSTEM. 
In his report for 1880, the State superintendent says that there is no law in force in 
South Carolina regulating the school age, and the practice has been to leave attendance 
unrestricted. Inasmuch, however, as the school attendance is now increasing more rap- 
idly than the school fund, he recommends that only pupils between 6 and 16 be admitted 
hereafter, except where others are needed to make up the number necessary to constitute 
a public school. The schools are sustained ‘from the proceeds of a tax of 2 mills on $1, 
to be levied by the boards of county commissioners, which, with a poll tax of $1 
on each voter, to be retained in the county where it is collected, constitutes the State 
fund for school purposes. This, under the constitution, was to go to the several school 
districts of the counties ‘‘in proportion to the respective number of pupils attending the 
public schools;’’ the school law of 1878 used the phraseology ‘‘the average number of 
pupils attending’’ and the act of December 20, 1881, the words ‘‘in proportion to the 
average attendance upon the free schools for the last preceding year.’’ The city of Charles- 
ton levies by special law a tax of 1 mill on $1, and at least three other places, under 
special acts, may levy local taxes; but no general system of district taxation is in use. 
The length of the school session in each county is determined by the amount of State 
money received, and hence the average time is only between three and four months, 
though the constitution calls for 6 months of school. Teachers must have certificates of 
qualification from the State board of examiners or from that of the county where they 
propose to teach; in Charleston, from the city board. 
GENERAL CONDITION, 
South Carolina in 1881 reported 84 more free public schools, 190 more school-houses, 
91 more of them owned by districts, and 29 more built within the year, the others being 
either rented or gratuitously loaned. The average time of school was lengthened by 
about 3 days. The valuation of school property in use rose considerably, more teachers 
were employed, and ataslight increase of pay, with 120 more children enrolled in the free 
schools for whites. The enrolment in the schools for colored youth fell off by 734, a 
decrease in total enrolment of 614. The decrease in attendance of colored pupils, the 
superintendent says, was not from deficiency of educational provision for them, as 100 
more teachers of that class were employed. In some counties the school commissioners 
reported that it was due in part to the unusually severe winter. In the one where the 
decrease was greatest it came partly from the fact that the school officers were endeay- 
oring to improve the school-houses, and could only do this by using the school funds, so 
that little was left for tuition in them when completed. It is hoped, however, that the 
improvement of accommodations will tell on the attendance of succeeding years, while 
the fact that an institute for colored teachers was held for 4 weeks in July of 1881, with 
large attendance and with excellent instructors, justifies the hope of great advance in 
school organization, discipline, and teaching. The similar instruction for white teachers 
given in another institute seems likely to increase considerably the attendance in the 
schools for whites. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
This State received from the Peabody trustees $4,050 for 1881, of which $1,000 went 
for teachers’ institutes, $1,600 for teachers’ scholarships at Nashville, $500 for training 
colored teachers at Claflin University, $450 for normal training at Hampton Institute, 
YVa., and $250 each for public schools of Winnsboro’ and Chester. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Only 2 of these means of early preparation for school studies appear to have existed 
in 1881, one at the Charleston Orphan House, another at Williamston Female College, 
Williamston. No statistics of these have reached the Bureau. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
CHARLESTON. 
Officers. —The city of Charleston constitutes a separate school district, with a school 
board composed of a commissioner from each of its 8 wards, elected at every general 
municipal election, the board choosing its own officers, one of whom is superintendent 
of city schools. This board determines the studies to be pursued and the text books to
-P-A-G-E-515

be used ; makes rules for the government of the schools ; elects and dismisses teachers, 
causing examinations to be made and granting diplomas to suchas have prosecuted suc- 
cessfully the studies in a normal school department. 
Statistics for 1880-’81.— Population by census of 1880, 49,984; there is no enumera- 
tion of the youth of school age available later than that for 1877 ; enrolled in public 
schools (5 in number, 3 of them for whites and 2 for colored pupils), 6,336, a decrease 
of 948; teachers employed, the same as in 1879-’80, 86 whites and 5 colored; average 
monthly pay of women, $39.23; of men, including 2 colored, $121.66; total of salaries 
paid, $46,171. 
Additional particulars.— The 5 school-houses reported were, with one exception, brick, 
with grounds inclosed, and all said to be in good condition. Two of them stand on 
glebe lands, for which a rent is paid. The valuation of the 5, including furniture and 
apparatus, was $125,000. Another building was in progress, for use in 1882. The city 
high school, which charges a small fee for tuition, is not reckoned among the public 
schools, although a part of the city system of instruction. 
Other schools in the city, not of the public system, but made in a large measure free 
to those attending them through aid from societies or individuals, were the Holy Com- 
munion Church Institute, for boys, with 206 pupils and 185 in average attendance; Cen- 
tral School (for boys), 302 pupils; average attendance, 268; Society Street School (for 
girls), 222; average, 180; Avery Normal Institute (for colored pupils), 439; average, 
275, about one-half free through aid from the American Missionary Association (Congre- 
gational); Wallingford Academy (also for colored youth), 618; average, 489, mainly free 
through aid from the Presbyterian Committee of Missions for Freedmen: whole attend- 
ance inall these, 1,787; average attendance, 1,397.— (State report for 1880-’81 and city 
year book for 1881.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
There were four institutions of this class reporting for 1881, all for the training of col- 
ored teachers. There is no State normal school. 
The Avery Normal Institute, Charleston, organized in 1865 and largely aided by the 
American Missionary Association, had 3 resident and 7 non-resident instructors giving 
instruction in primary, intermediate, and normal departments. The normal course 
covered 5 years; the preparatory classical, 3 years. There were 160 normal and 299 other 
students in attendance in 1881. Since its foundation this school has graduated 45 men 
and 80 women, besides giving instruction to thousands. 
Fairfield Normal Institute, Winnsboro’, organized in 1869, reported $850 received from 
public funds, and had 4 instructors, 72 normal and 278 other students in attendance, with 
32 graduates, all of whom have since engaged in teaching. 
The Normal Department of Brainerd Institute, Chester, reported 3 instructors and 40 stu- 
dents, perhaps not all strictly normal. There were 3 departments, primary, grammar, 
and high. 
The Normal School of Claflin University, Orangeburg, organized in 1868, had 4 instruct- 
ors and 76 normal and 52 other students. Two of the normal students graduated and 
engaged in teaching. The normal course covered 3 years of 33 weeks each. A model 
school is also reported. As beforestated, $500 were granted by the Peabody fund trust- 
ees for the training of colored teachers at this school. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
. 
The second State normal institute for white teachers was held at Greenville, August 
2-30, 1881, with aid from the Peabody fund supplementing a State appropriation, and 
enrolled 335 teachers from 28 counties. The regular work, which was carried on in the 
buildings of Furman University and of the Baptist Female College, included instruc- 
tion in the science of education and method of discipline, the English language, primary 
methods of instruction, arithmetic, and geography. Optional studies were penman- 
ship, singing, physical geography, algebra, calisthenics, Latin, French, and German. 
Mr. F. Louis Soldan, principal of the City Normal School of St. Louis, Mo., had gen: 
eral charge of the instruction to be given, assisted by Professor Joynes, of the University 
of Tennessee, and by some of the most successful teachers of the State. Among the 
lecturers were the United States Commissioner of Education; Dr. Curry, general agent 
of the Peabody fund; Dr. William T. Harris, long city superintendent at St. Louis; and 
President Miles, of South Carolina College. 
The first State normal institute for colored teachers was held in Columbia, July 5-29, 
1881. The faculty was composed of colored instructors from Washington, D.C. A 
membership of 185 pupil teachers, who represented 25 of the 33 counties of the State, 
was reported. Instruction was given in methods of teaching arithmetic, reading, phonic

  238 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
spelling, map and free hand drawing, penmanship, vocal music, geography, and hygiene; 
the grading of country schools was discussed, a programme for one of four grades being 
placed upon the blackboard, and much time was spent in practice teaching. Addresses 
were delivered by Governor Hagood, General John Eaton, and others. : 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Free schools of this grade form no part of the public school system of the State. Sev- 
eral institutions called high schools appear in a table appended to the State superintend- 
ent’s report for 1880-’81, but it is a title indicating only a higher grade of pay school. 
Charleston High School, for boys, reduced its annual rate from $100 to $40 a pupil, but, 
though it belonged to and was assisted by the city, it did not profess to receive free 
scholars. It enrolled 125, under 5 teachers. Its course, not long since revised, requires 
Latin, but allows French and German to be substituted for Greek. In the city year _ 
book for 1881 it is stated that a new site for this school, with ample grounds and build- 
ings, had been bought, and that on these grounds a gymnasium had been built, where, 
under a skilled instructor, a regular course of physical exercises was to be pursued. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
In the table of the State report before referred to, 33 schools of academic grade or 
with academic classes are presented, having 120 teachers and 2,713 pupils, besides the 
Charleston High School, with 5 teachers and 125 pupils. 
For private academic schools, preparatory schools, and preparatory departments of col- 
leges reporting to this Bureau, see Tables VI, VII, and [X of the appendix to this volume; 
for summaries of the statistics of each class, corresponding tables in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Seven institutions of this class continued to give instruction in 1880-81, as well as in 
the opening of 1881-82. Only 1 of them, Claflin University, Orangeburg, for colored 
students, was open to women, and this showed but 2 women on its collegiate roll for 
1880-’81, though there were many in lower classes. Those for young men were, as be- 
fore, the College of Charleston, Charleston; Erskine College, Due West; Furman Uni- 
versity, Greenville; Newberry College, Newberry; Wofford College, Spartanburg, and 
Adger College, Walhalla. All, except the College of Charleston (which is a city col- 
lege), were under some denominational influence; all, except Furman and Wofford, 
had the usual 4 years’ classical course; and all appear to have had also partial courses. 
Furman and Wofford had their studies arranged in schools, any one of which could be 
entered and graduated from, or several of them could be taken in combination to form 
aregular A. B. course. Wofford had just adopted this arrangement in place of a fixed 
4 years’ course; Furman and Charleston Colleges were reorganizing their courses. Wof- 
ford College reports a legacy of $100,000 from the late Rev. Benjamin Wofford; Claflin 
University, donations amounting to $9,150 from Hon. William B. Claflin, of Massachu- 
setts, Mrs. Claflin, and others. 
The old University of South Carolina, suspended in 1877 and reorganized in 1878 and 
1879, has been divided, the part of it designed, for whites remaining at Columbia; that 
for colored students, at Claflin University, Orangeburg. Both are sustained out of the 
agricultural college fund and have the character and courses of agricultural and me- 
chanical colleges. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Four such schools report for 1880-81, namely: Columbia Female College, Columbia; 
Due West Female College, Due West; Greenville Female College, Greenville; and Wal- 
halla Female College, Walhalla. All had arrangements for primary and academic as 
well as collegiate instruction, the last in courses of 3 to 4 years. Greenville offered also 
a graduate course of 4 years. All taught music, drawing, and painting, with French, 
and the two last mentioned included German. Williamston College, Williamston, in 
a catalogue of 1879, presented essentially the same arrangements, with Kindergarten 
and some polytechnic studies, and in 1880 made a return of its statistics, but makes no 
report for 1881. The statistics of the 4 institutions that report show 251 preparatory 
students, 296 collegiate, and 9 special, 556 in all, under 44 instructors. For any other 
information, see Table VIII of the appendix.

SOUTH CAROLINA. 239 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanics, Columbia, organized in 1880 
for white youths of the State, occupies the buildings of the former University of South 
Carolina and reports a 3 years’ scientific course, with opportunity for practical instruc- 
tion both on the farm and in the shop. Lecture and laboratory courses in general and 
agricultural chemistry are also offered. Tuition is free, except in the department of 
languages. Students of the college are at liberty to use the library of the university, 
which contains 27,000 volumes. There were 4 professors and instructors and 58 stu- 
dents in 1881. 
The South Carolina Agricultural College, Orangeburg, in connection with Claflin Uni- 
versity for colored youth, carries out the design of Congress in its grant for the endow- 
ment of such institutions by providing about 150 acres of choice land for practical 
instruction in agriculture and a carpenter shop for mechanical work. Scientific and 
industrial education are united, and the student, By labor on the farm and in the shop, 
may defray part of the expenses of his education. A scientific and agricultural course 
of 4 years is offered, requiring for admission an examination in the preparatory and 
normal studies of the university, which occupy 3 years. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
There are two institutions giving theological instruction that report for 1881. Bene- 
dict Institute, Columbia, established in 1871 by the American Baptist Home Mission 
Society for the education of ministers of the gospel and of teachers, male and female, 
had 190 students, of which number 43 were in the theological department. Baker In- 
stitute, a department of Claflin University, Orangeburg, for the preparation of young 
men for the Christian ministry, was said in the catalogue of the university to be work- 
ing successfully; but there was no note of either course or students. The Theological 
Seminary of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church South, Columbia, here- 
tofore suspended, was to be reopened in 1882. 
The Medical College of the State of South Carolina (regular) continued in 1881 to require 
3 years of study, including 2 lecture terms of 20 weeks each. There were 77 students 
in 1880-’81, 30 receiving the degree of M. D. and 3 degrees in pharmacy. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The South Carolina Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind 
in its thirty-third annual report gives an enrolment of 43 deaf and dumb and 16 blind 
pupils. Advancement was reported in all departments, especially in the class in articu- 
lation. Buildings for shops were being erected, and the institution in all its appoint- 
ments was said to be ready to carry on its work. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
The Holy Communion Church Institute, Charleston, founded in 1867, reported a princi- 
pal, assisted by 14 teachers and matrons, an enrolment of 206, with an average attend- 
ance of 185. Of the 125 resident pupils 44 were beneficiary; of the 81 day scholars, 37 
had scholarships. 
The Thornwell Orphanage, Clinton, organized in 1875 under the auspices of the Presby- 
terian Church, receives children between the ages of 5 and 13, and permits them to 
remain till they are 16 or 18, when, having been trained and educated, they are enabled 
to find good homes. The common and someof the higher English branches are taught; 
also, Latin, French, and vocal and instrumental music. A new school building is con- 
templated, to be called the Orphans’ Seminary. All the work of the institution is done 
by the pupils, the boys learning farming, printing, and house painting; the girls, sew- 
ing, cookery, and housework. There were 14 beys and 22 girls reported for 1881. 
The Carolina Orphans’ Home, Spartanburg, founded in 1873, is temporarily suspended. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
The law requires county school commissioners to encourage the holding of such asso- 
ciations, but no report of any meetings, except the State normal institutes for white and 
colored, previously noted, has been received.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of schools, nominated by the governor and confirmed by the 
senate for a term of 2 years, has the supervision of the public school system. He must 
have literary and scientific attainments and skill and experience in the art of teaching. 
County superintendents, required to have like qualifications and elected biennially by
-P-A-G-E-519
  
TENNESSEE. Da. 
  the county court of each county, exercise a general supervision over the schools in each 
county. ‘Three school directors, elected by the people of each district for 3 years, with 
annual change of one, have charge of discipline in the district schools. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Separate public schools for whites and blacks are free to youth of school age (6-21), 
to ascertain the number of whom a census is taken annually. These schools are sus- 
tained from the proceeds of a State school fund of $2,512,500, bearing interest at 6 per 
cent., an annual poll tax of $1 on every male citizen, and a State tax of 1 mill on $1 of 
all property subject to taxation. 
The revenues from the first source are apportioned semiannually among the counties 
according to scholastic population; those from the other two are retained in the counties 
where they are collected and are distributed among the school districts on the same 
basis as the State fund. If the means from these sources do not suffice to keep up a public 
school in each district for five months in each year, the county court must either levy an 
additional tax for this purpose or submit to the people a proposition to do this by vote. 
The same court may levy a tax to prolong the school term beyond 5 months. Teachers 
must have duly authorized certificates of qualification to obtain employment in the 
schools and receive pay for teaching, which pay is to be the same for men and women 
doing the same work. The studies to be pursued in every public school are definitely 
stated, and include the common English branches, with agriculture, elementary geology 
of Tennessee, and history of the United States, to which may be added vocal music and 
such other branches as may be provided for by local taxes or be contracted for at certain 
rates of pay. Where the number of pupils is sufficient, schools are to be graded according 
to the advancement of pupils. To further this, public scholars are allowed to be taught 
in higher grade private or corporate schools at public school rates. Such are called con- 
solidated schools. 
GENERAL CONDITION, 
The statistics of 1880 are for 91 counties out of 94; those of 1881, for only 89 out of 
95. Taken by themselves, they seem to indicate retrogression rather than advancement; 
for, although there were 86 more public schools, 40 more consolidated ones, and 17 more 
private, with 926 more teachers, to meet an increase of 1,013 youth of school age, there 
appear to have been 12,687 fewer pupils attending public and private schools during the 
second of these years than in the first, while the number in average daily attendance fell 
off 13,539. School property, too, is rated in 1881 at nearly $200,000 less than in 1880, 
though there were improvements reported in school buildings (520 log school-houses 
being abandoned) and there were two more public school-houses. 
It may be that some of the loss was apparent only, growing out of lack of reports, since 
many of the superintendents describe the condition of the schools as good and report 
popular sentiment with respect to them as improving. Many of the school-houses are 
said to have been supplied with better furniture, and progress is reported in securing 
uniform series of text books. The thing most needed to bring about a better condition 
of the State system appears to be more local taxation to supplement the State distribu- 
table school fund, thus making possible longer school sessions with better pay of teachers. 
Much advancement is looked for consequent on the action of the legislature of 1881, 
which extended to all incorporated towns the privilege of levying taxes for such purposes. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
The trustees of this fund in 1881 furnished aid to the amount of $5,500 to this State, 
which was divided as follows: Normal college, $3,000; teachers’ institutes, $1,500; edu- 
cational journal, $200; Jackson public schools, $800.— (Report of trustees of Peabody 
fund.) 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
For cities there are boards of education, varying in number of members, elected by 
the people, with partial change each year. City school superintendents are elected by 
these boards.

242 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Chattanooga classed its schools as primary, grammar, and high, and accommodated 
them in 7 buildings (4 of which were owned by the city) containing 36 rooms. There 
were 1,480 white and 854 colored pupils enrolled during the year, a gain of 149. The 
schools were taught 158 days by 5 men and 29 women. School property was valued at 
$39,750. The high school offers a 3 years’ course, including Latin and German, and 
had 6 graduates in 1881. An enrolment of 350 in private schools was given.— (City 
report and return. ) 
Knoxville had 5 school-houses containing 31 school and 2 recitation rooms, with 1,541 
sittings for study, occupied by its primary, grammar, and high schools. The schools 
were taught 196 days by 5 men and 24 women. Private schools reported an enrolment 
of 120, with 100 in average attendance, taught by 2 teachers in 2 buildings, with 3 rooms 
and 120 sittings.— (Return. ) 
Memphis reported a school population of 5,837 white and 3,908 colored children, and 
had 10 school buildings (4 belonging to the city), containing 64 school rooms, with 3,780 
sittings. The schools are graded as primary, grammar, and high, the course of study 
covering 8 years in the lower grades and 3 in the high school. A class of 21 girls and 3 
boys graduated in 1881. School property was valued at $139,050. The schools were 
taught 164 days by 6 men and 56 women.— (City report and return.) 
Nashville divides its schools into primary, with 3 years; intermediate and grammar, 
each with 2 years; and high, with a 3 years’ course. It accommodated them in 13 
school-houses, 9 owned by the city, containing 5,950 sittings for study. The schools 
were taught 182 of the 193 school days in the year by 15 men and 82 women, with 
special teachers for music, drawing, and penmanship. The scholastic population re- 
ported shows an increase of 2,052, while there was a decrease of 253 in enrolment. 
The superintendent distrusted the census and thought the apparent decrease in enrol- 
ment due to former inaccuracies in keeping the registers. Private schools occupied 9 
buildings, with 24 rooms and 1,500 sittings; employed 23 teachers; and enrolled 500 
pupils, with 440 in average attendance.— (City report and return.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
The State Normal College, opened at Nashville in 1875 under the sanction of the State 
of Tennessee, constitutes the literary department of the University of Nashville and is 
supported from the funds of the university, from the Peabody educational fund, and 
from State appropriations for scholarships. It receives from any State students of either 
sex desiring to qualify themselves to teach, and is substantially a normal college of high 
grade forthe wholeSouth. Thecourseofstudy, covering3 years, with an additional optional 
year for advanced work, is strictly professional, and includes instruction in the manage- 
ment and organization of classes and schools. Students completing the 3 years’ course 
receive the degree of licentiate of instruction, and may teach in the public schools of 
their States without further examination; upon those taking the advanced or baccalaureate 
course, the university’confers the degree of B. A. There were 56 men and 105 women in 
attendance in 1881, of whom 61 graduated; 6 had received academic degrees and 59 at 
once engaged in teaching.— (Catalogue and return. ) 
The Summer Normal Institute at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, held in June 
and July, 1881, was well organized and successful and did mucho elevate the standard 
of public school education. The whole number of students enrolled was 218, while 
many others were in attendance part of the session. The regular students were from 35 
counties, nearly three-fourths of them being teachers in the public schools. Instruction. 
in the branches taught in these schools comprised the regular course, while optional 
courses in languages, natural science, and drawing were offered. Instructive and inter- 
esting lectures on general educational topics were delivered and were free to all. Of the 
65 persons who entered the examinations held at the close of the session, 17 received cer- 
tificates of the first grade and 19 of the second. 
There were 12 other institutions reporting normal departments or normal courses, viz: 
East Tennessee Wesleyan University, Athens; Humboldt Normal Institute, Humboldt; 
Warner Institute, Jonesborough; Knoxville College, Knoxville; Freedmen’s Normal 
Institute, Maryville; Maryville College, Maryville; Le Moyne Normal Institute, Mem- 
phis; Morristown Seminary, Morristown; Central Tennessee College, Nashville; Fisk 
University, Nashville; Nashville Normal and Theological Institute, Nashville, and 
Winchester Normal, Winchester.

mary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding.

STATE TEACHERS’ INSPITUTE. 
The fifth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Institute, for whites, was held at 
Nashville, December 27, 1881, J. Braden, D. D., of Central Tennessee College, presiding. 
The following papers were read: ‘‘ Methods and illustrations in teaching,’’ Prof. D. 
Moury; ‘‘Courses of study,’’ Professor Tefft; ‘‘ Normal school work,’’ Prof. A. W. Farn- 
ham, of Atlanta University, Georgia, and others by President E. H. Fairchild, of Berea, 
Ky., Prof. A. J. Steele, and Prof. H. 8. Bennett. Brief addresses were made by Dr. 
Ward, of the New York Independent, Ex-Governor Washburn, of Massachusetts, Rev. W. 
8. Doak, superintendent of public instruction for Tennessee, and Rey. O. P. F. Fitzger- 
ald, formerly State superintendent in California.— (Indiana School Journal.) 
INSTITUTES FOR COLORED TEACHERS. 
Superintendent Doak reports 3 normal institutes for colored teachers held by aid from 
the Peabody fund; the total attendance in these was 120. He also reports the holding 
of 168 county institutes, and considers these county meetings of great importance because 
they are the only special means of improvement within the reach of a large number of 
teachers. He advises the State to grant aid to these institutes.— (State report.) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Educational Record, published at Nashville and Tusculum and edited by Miss 
Julia A. Doak, issued its first number in August, 1881. The aim was to publish a lively 
but earnest home journal, devoted to the educational interests of Tennessee. Dr. Curry, 
agent of the Peabody fund, offered some aid, and the trustees of Greeneville and Tuscu- 
lum College contributed the use of their press. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
The State report does not give statistics for schools of this class in 1881, but the cities 
of Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis, and Nashville report high schools. The first, 
third, and fourth named had 3 years’ courses, including Latin. “Knoxville, ina return, 
gives 6 teachers and 194 pupils enrolled, with 177 in daily attendance in its high school; 
but does not give the course of study, which in 1880 was apparently of 2 years. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, IX, and X of the appendix; for summaries of 
the same, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
More consolidated schools are reported, where instruction in higher branches may be 
given if the trustees so direct, and some high school instruction is probably thus re- 
ceived. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES, 
The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, made a State institution in 1879 and open to 
men only, reports a preparatory department with 3 instructors and 92 students, and 9 pro- 
fessors and 141 students in the 4 years’ course of the university. The degree of B. A. was 
conferred upon 9 young men and that of B. 8. upon 8 at the close of the year 1880-’81." 
Of the 16 other colleges reporting, 9 were for both sexes, 7 for men exclusively. Two 
reported themselves non-sectarian, 4 were under control of the Methodist Episcopal, 4 of 
the Presbyterian, and 2 of the Baptist Churches, while the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, 
Protestant Episcopal, and Christian Churches were each represented by one. Two (Cen- 
tral Tennessee College and Fisk University, Nashville) were for the colored race. All 
in the State gave some preparatory instruction and had substantially 4 years’ collegiate 
courses, though in 6 the plan of separate schools was adopted. Fourteen had scientific 
courses or departments; 6 prepared for business; 11 made provision for instruction in 
modern languages, 5 for graduate and 6 for normal study; 10 offered biblical or theologi- 
cal instruction; 3 had departments of law, and 3 of medicine, 1 of these last, Vanderbilt 
University, Nashville, adding dentistry and pharmacy. 
For statistics of colleges reporting, see Table IX of appendix, and a summary of the 
same in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of the 20 universities and colleges in the State 10 admit both sexes, Maryville Col- 
lege having a separate course for women. Besides these, 20 exclusively for young women

are on the lists of this Bureau (of which 16 only make report for 1881, however), all 
but 3 of them holding charters from the State and most of them presenting courses of 
4to7 years. Most of them have arrangements for teaching music, drawing and paint- 
ing, and modern languages; but comparatively few have had libraries of any extent or 
much school apparatus. 
For statistics of those that report, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary of 
these statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
No catalogue for 1881 has been received from the State University, Knoxville, which 
is also the State Agricultural College. In 1880 there were 5 technical courses of 4 years 
each, viz: civil engineering, mechanical and mining engineering, agriculture, and applied 
chemistry. There were also partial courses of 2 years each in practical agriculture and 
in applied mathematics. In the former, students alternated their studies with work on 
the tarm, for which they received pay and were thus enabled to earn their board. As 
tuition is free to all State appointees, it is hoped that this shorter course will bring to 
the university a large number of the farming community. Courses in science are found 
in 13 of the colleges or universities, while Cumberland, Vanderbilt, and the University 
of the South, at Lebanon, Nashville, and Sewanee, offer courses in engineering. 
For statistics of scientific schools reporting, see Table X of the appendix; for summary 
of statistics, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The theological schools reporting for 1881 are the Theological School of Cumberland 
University, Lebanon (Cumberland Presbyterian); Nashville Normal and Theological In- 
stitute, Nashville (Baptist); theological departments of Central Tennessee College and 
Vanderbilt University, Nashville (both Methodist); Fisk University (Congregational), 
also at Nashville; and the theological department of the University of the South, Se- 
wanee (Protestant Episcopal). An examination for admission is not invariably required 
in these schools; in the Protestant Episcopal school it is demanded by a law of the 
church. All report courses of study of from 2 to4 years. The East Tennessee Wesleyan 
University, Athens (Methodist Episcopal); Southwest Baptist University, Jackson; 
Bethel College, McKenzie (Cumberland Presbyterian), and Burritt College, Spencer 
(Christian), all offer biblical instruction in a greater or less degree. 
Legal instruction is given in the law school of Cumberland University, Lebanon, as 
well as in the law departments of Central Tennessee College and of Vanderbilt Univer- 
sity, both at Nashville. The first was organized in 1847, and reports a 1 year’s course of 
40 weeks, with 45 students, of whom 32 graduated; the second, organized in 1880, has a 
course of 2 years of 32 weeks each, and had 4 students; the last, opened for instruction 
in 1875, has a 2 years’ course, each year of 39 weeks, and had 53 students, 13 of them 
having received a collegiate degree. It graduated 18. 
The regular medical schools reporting are Meharry Medical Department of Central 
Tennessee College, for colored students of both sexes; Nashville Medical College (a de- 
partment of the State University), for which a new building was erected in 1881; and 
the medical departments of Vanderbilt University and of the University of Nashville. 
Meharry presents the regular 3 years’ course of study, with two lecture courses of 20 weeks 
- each, and offers an additional year’s instruction without extra charge. Nashville Medi- 
cal College requires for graduation 3 years of study, 2 full lecture courses of 24 weeks 
each, and attendance on dissections during the year. Vanderbilt requires 2 lecture 
courses of 20 weeks and at least 33 months’ study. The University of Nashville has 
the same requirements as Vanderbilt. Both offer, but do not require, a 3 years’ graded 
course, with examinations at the close of the second and third years. 
Vanderbilt University and the medical department of the University of Tennessee 
each have departments of dentistry, requiring attendance on 2 lecture courses of 20 weeks 
each, with approved dental work, both operative and mechanical. Vanderbilt admits 
women to this department. 
The department of pharmacy of Vanderbilt requires 3 hours’ laboratory work daily, 
with attendance on 2 full courses of lectures of 20 weeks each, and a thesis, for gradua- 
tion. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Tennessee School for the Deaf and Dumb, Knoxville, founded in 1845, reported 
60 boys and 40 girls under instruction in the common school branches in 1881. Shoe- 
making and printing are taught and agriculture to a limited degree. The articulation 
method is used.— (Return. )
-P-A-G-E-523
TENNESSEE. 245 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Tennessee School for the Blind, Nashville, in a biennial report covering 1880 (the 
last received), stated that the common English and some of the higher branches were 
taught. Special attention was paid to music, all but one of the pupils taking both 
vocal and instrumental lessons. Instruction in piano tuning, calisthenics, and various 
industrial employments was also given. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
Miss Emily L. Austin, in her report of the Knoxville Industrial School, established by 
her in connection with the colored public school of that city, says that the sewing school 
completed 329 articles and sold one hundred dollars’ worth of goods to the women in the 
night meetings. A kitchen garden had been established and one of the scholars sent to 
a Philadelphia school of cookery, that he might be able to teach a class in connection 
with this school.— (Circular. ) 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
The Church Orphans’ Home, Memphis, under control of the Sisters of St. Mary, 
founded in 1867, is the only institution of this class reporting for 1881. The children 
are taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, sewing, and house work. There were 46 
inmates at Easter in 1881. The Canfield Orphans’ Asylum, Memphis, St. Mary’s Or- 
phan Asylum, Nashville, and the Nashville Protestant Orphan Asylum have heretofore 
reported. 
For statistics of all such institutions reporting, see Table XXII of the appendix. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
TENNESSEE STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association, in connection with the West Tennessee Institute, held a very interest- 
ing and profitable meeting, attended by more than 60 teachers and superintendents, at 
Humboldt, December 1, 1881. The address of welcome by Hon. W. J. McFarland was 
responded to by 8. Y. Caldwell, of the Nashville city schools, president of the association. 
The subjects presented for discussion were “‘The necessity for normal training,’’ Super- 
intendent J. C. Brooks; ‘‘ Character building in education,’’ Prof. J. W. Conger; ‘‘How 
to keep our educated young men from leaving the State,’’ Superintendent J. R. Deason; 
“What shall we do for our girls?”’ Miss C. Conway; ‘‘Discipline,”? Dr. W. A. Smith; 
“Public schools of Tennessee,’ Judge Turner Foster; ‘‘Education and national pros- 
perity,’’ Superintendent W. S. Doak; ‘‘Practical science,’’ Prof. N. T. Tupton; ‘‘ Pri- 
mary instruction,’”? Miss Nannie Rea. Professors Newhardt, Goodman, Jones, Davis, 
and others took part in the discussions.— (State report. ) 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
GEORGE STODDART BLACKIE, M. D., PH. D. 
This eminent scholar, writer, and teacher, great grandson of James Watts of steam 
engine celebrity, was born at Aberdeen, Scotland, April 10, 1834. He began his edu- 
cation at Edinburgh and continued it at Aberdeen, subsequently studying medicine at 
Edinburgh and at the Universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Paris. The degrees of A. M. 
and M. D. and the highest honors were conferred on him by the University of Edin- 
burgh, and later he received other honors and was made a member of various scientific 
societies in Scotland and in this country. After practising medicine afew years he came 
to Nashville, where he continued till his death, with the exception of two years spent in 
teaching in New York. He was professor of botany, chemistry, and natural history in 
the medical department of the University of Nashville, 1857, and after his return from 
New York in 1874 held similar positions in the Tennessee College of Pharmacy and the 
Nashville Medical College. Upon the organization of the medical department of the 
University of Tennessee he accepted the position of professor of chemistry, which he 
retained till his death. An author as well as teacher, he published, several works on 
botany and other subjects, besides contributing to English and American scientific and 
medical journals, and for twelve years he was one of the editors of the Nashville Medical 
Journal. When the publication of the Southern Practitioner was contemplated the po- 
sition of senior editor was accepted by him and much of its success is said to have been 
due to his deep culture and great ability. He was a freemason of high rank anda 
contributor to the literature of freemasonry. He died in Nashville, Sunday, June 19, 
1881.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The officers who have general control of the public school interests are the governor, 
secretary of state, and State comptroller, who constitute a State board of education. The 
secretary of this board has the office duties of a superintendent of education. The admin- 
istration of public school affairs in each county is in the hands of the county judge, who 
appoints a board of 3 examiners, consisting of 3 well educated citizens of the county. 
The interests of each community school are in charge of 3 trustees appointed by the 
county judge. In cities and towns that have assumed control of their public schools, 
the city council or board of aldermen have exclusive power to maintain, regulate, and 
govern the city schools.— (Laws, 1879.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The appropriation made for the support of free public schools for 1879-’80 and 1880-81 
consisted of the net proceeds of one-sixth ofthe ad valorem and occupation taxes collected 
and of all the annual poll tax, together with the interest on the permanent school 
fund, however invested. The fund thus formed was to be distributed on the basis of 
children of school age in each community. Cities and towns controlling their own 
schools may, by a two-thirds vote of qualified taxpayers, at an election held for that pur- 
pose, levy such a tax (not to exceed one-half of 1 per cent.), in addition to the pro rata 
of the available school fund received from the State, as may be necessary to conduct the 
schools for ten months in the year. The council or board of aldermen are authorized to 
pass such ordinances, consistent with the State laws, as may be necessary to establish 
and maintain free schools, purchase sites, and construct school-houses. Separate schools 
must be opened for white and colored children, but all are entitled alike to the benefit 
of the available free school fund. Tuition in the common English branches is free to all 
children of school age. Pupils not of scholastic age may attend the community free 
schools upon payment of such tuition fees as may be agreed upon between the teacher 
and parents; but the interests of State pupils are not to be subordinated to those of pri- 
vate pupils. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Owing to the burning of the returns made to the secretary of the State board for 1881, 
no Official statement of the general condition of education in the State can be made. The 
Texas Journal of Education of October, 1881, in an editorial, states that there were 7,000 
public free schools maintained for an average term of four months, with an average en- 
rolment of 200,000 pupils of lawful scholastic age. The Journal of Education, October, 
1881, says: “‘Reports received from the principal cities and towns show a largely in- 
creased attendance over the same period last year. Favorable reports have also been 
received from many rural districts.’’ 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
The agent of the Peabody fund granted in 1880-81 for the improvement of schools in 
Texas $10,800, divided as follows: Sam Houston Normal College, $4,500; Houston pub- 
lic schools, $750; Bryan public schools, $800; teachers’ institutes, $2,000; educational 
journal, $200; Nashville scholarships for teachers to be trained at the Normal College 
there, $2,550. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
In cities and towns that have assumed control of their public schools the city council 
or board of aldermen are the legal school officers. Galveston reports a city superintend- 
ent of schools, appointed in September, 1881, and a board of trustees. Houston and 
some smaller towns make reports that indicate the same provision. 
STATISTICS AND ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Austin elected a board of trustees in 1880, and in September, 1881, levied a tax of 2 
mills on the dollar, which, added to the State fund and $2,000 from the Peabody fund, 
made $16,000, a sam sufficient to run the schools 9 scholastic months. The schools were 
organized by the superintendent, and 25 teachers, 16 of them ladies, began work under 
the new system. Schools were graded as primary, grammar, and high, allowing 4 years 
for each grade. The enrolment the first week was 500, but had reached 1,090 at the 
close of the year.— (Texas Journal of Education, J: anuary, 1882. 
Galveston assumed control of her public school fund in July, 1881, and immediately 
elected trustees and levied a special school tax of 2 mills on the dollar of assessed valua- 
tion, which, with $10,000 from the State, amounted to $42,000. A superintendent was 
appointed, and the schools were organized in September. Up to December 31 they had

  248 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
enrolled about 1,750 pupils and 34 teachers, with an average of 85 per cent. in attend- 
ance. ‘The school age is 6 to 16, being 4 years longer than that of the State. School 
property was valued at $21,000, and an estimated enrolment of 400 in private schools 
was reported. Regular normal institutes under the care of the superintendent are held 
twice a month, one for white and one for colored teachers.— {Letter from superintendent 
and return. ) 
San Antonio reported to the State superintendent a population of 20,550 and 27 schools 
maintained for 10 months. With a scholastic population of 3,603, there was an enrol- 
ment of 1,737, with 1,045 in avérage daily attendance. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
Ewe institutions of this class were organized in 1879, one for white pupils and one for 
colored. 
The Sam Houston Normal Institute (for whites), Huntsville, is not designed to be an 
academic high school, but a school to fit teachers for their work by practical drill in 
organizing and conducting schools. The requisites for admission are residence in the 
State, girls not to be less than 18 and boys not less than 20 years of age, and an avowed 
purpose to follow teaching as a profession, with a pledge to teach as many sessions in the 
public schools of this State as the pupil attends at this institute. All pupils must also 
sustain a satisfactory examination in the branches taught in the public free schools. The 
State has increased its annual appropriation to $18,000 and the Peabody fund granted a 
donation of $9,000, enabling the institution to receive 4 Staté pupils from each senatorial 
district. Tuition and books are free to all who may attend; board and lodging are also 
free to State pupils for one year, an incidental fee of $4 a session being the only outlay 
required from them. The course of study covers two years, with an additional year for 
advanced work if desired. Two graduates are selected each year to receive advanced in- 
struction at the expense of the Peabody fund in the Normal College at Nashville, Tenn. 
A model school composed of the resident children of Huntsville has been organized as a 
regular department of the institute. There were 7 resident instructors, 2U0 students, 
(including 50 model school children), and 70 graduates reported for 1881. All the grad- 
uates subsequently engaged in teaching.— (Texas Journal of Education.) 
The State Normal School of Texas for Colored Students, Prairie View, organized under an 
act of the legislature by the board of directors of the Agricultural and Mechanical Col- 
lege in 1879, receives 1 student from each senatorial district and 3 from the State at 
Jarge free of all expense to the students. In January, 1881, there were 40 State, 6 pay, 
and 3 local students in attendance. 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS. 
The only schools of this class reporting for 1881 are Tillotson Collegiate and Normal 
Institute, Austin (1881), and Whitesboro’ Normal, Whitesboro’ (1880). The former, 
under the auspices of the American Missionary Association, is for colored pupils, and has 
primary, grammar, normal, preparatory, and collegiate departments. The normal course 
covers 4 years and requires thorough preparation in the: grammar department for ad- 
mission. A total attendance of 252 was given for 1881; of that number 31 were normal 
students. ‘The Whitesboro’ Normal has primary, grammar, and collegiate departments, 
and after 1880-’81 was to haveanormal class. From the American Normal School, Kelly- 
ville, no information has been received. 
Mansfield College, Mansfield, for both sexes, and Soule College, Chappell Hill, for 
young women, offered normal training, and Marvin College, Waxahachie, announced 
that a department for such instruction would be organized and made as efficient as pos- 
sible in 1881-’82. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTE. 
The secretary of the board of education, by means of aid granted from the Peabody fund, 
inaugurated on the 4th of July, 1881, seven normal institutes, which lasted from 5 to 6 
weeks, with an aggregate attendance of 451. The one at San Marcos, with 110 teachers 
in attendance, was the largest; the one at Orange, with 30 present, was the smallest of 6 
reported. The work in all was encouraging, and arrangements were made for holding 
similar meetings in 1882. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Texas Journal of Education, a paper devoted to public school interests, begun in 
August, 1880, and continued through 1881, was published at Austin. O. N. Hollings- 
worth, secretary of the State board of education, has been the editor, assisted by Mrs. 
Hollingsworth. Many subjects of educational importance are ably discussed. Normal 
schools and institutes, as well as all means for the aid and improvement of the teachers, 
receive special attention.

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
BUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Information in regard to schools of this class is even more meagre than in former years. 
In 1879-’80 it was known that such schools were sustained in Brenham, Denison, Hous- 
ton, and San Antonio, In 1881 Weatherford reported a class in the first grade of the 
high.school and Austin a 4 years’ course, but no statistics for that grade. 
OTHER SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
For information as to business colleges, private academies, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges reporting, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix; for summaries 
of4heir statistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OB FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Of 11 institutions of this class in the State, 9 present statistics for 1880-’81, and 
another (St. Joseph’s College, Brownsville) reports that it had been closed and its build- 
ings used for a yellow fever hospital. It was not to be reopened till 1883. The re- 
maining one (Salado College) has made no report of courses since 1873, and none of statis- 
tics since 1878. Of the 9 reporting, Southwestern University, Georgetown (Methodist 
Episcopal South), and Marvin College, Waxahachie (non-sectarian), gave instruction in 
schools of English, Latin, Greek, mathematics, &e. Baylor University, Independence 
(Baptist), at the date of its latest catalogue, appeared to have the same arrangement. 
St. Mary’s University, Galveston (Roman Catholic), makes report of preparatory students 
only. The other 5, all with arrangements for preparatory study and generally with 
‘the customary 4 years of collegiate study, were Henderson College, Henderson (non-sec- 
tarian); Mansfield Male and Female College, Mansfield (non-sectarian); Austin College, 
Sherman (Presbyterian) ; Trinity University, Tehuacana (Cumberland Presbyterian), 
and Waco University, Waco (Baptist). The last two mentioned, admitting women, had 
special courses for them, as well as commercial courses; Henderson and Marvin, also ad- 
initting them, allowed such courses. For statistics of those that have reported, see Table 
IX of the appendix; for a summary of them, a like table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
The State University has been located at Austin, on a site of 40 acres set apart many 
years ago, with its medical department at Galveston. The board of regents met and 
organized in November, 1881, at which meeting they established the several departments 
of the university, defined the general plan of the buildings, and provided for advertising 
for plans and specifications for the same. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Besides 6 of the colleges above mentioned that admit women to like privileges with 
young men, 13 schools claiming collegiate rank, 7 of them chartered, are on the lists of 
this Bureau. Four of these 7 report for 1881 a total of 34 instructors, with 197 prepara- 
tory and 268 collegiate students. Another reports 17 instructors and 103 students, without 
distinguishing the preparatory and collegiate. All the 5 taught music, drawing, and 
(with one exception) painting, giving instruction also in French and German, to which 
2 added Spanish. The courses in most of these schools are fairly advanced for a com- 
paratively new region, and some compare well with those in the older States. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIO, 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, College Station, organized in 1876 on the basis of the congressional land grant, with 7 schools, has undergone a radical change 
in its plan of instruction and is in reality now a school of agriculture and mechanics. 
The course of instruction embraced 2 courses for theoretical and practical professional training in agriculture and mechanics of 4 years each, in 1880-81. The freshman year 
is the same for both. By an act of the legislature of March, 1881, there are to be 3 
students from each senatorial district, appointed by the senators and representatives and 
maintained and instructed free of charge. The State students are assigned a course of 
study in accordance with their appointment; pay students may make their own selection, 
but no other distinction ismade. The study of ancient and modern languages is optional, 
but must not interfere with the regular course. The farm of 2,416 acres, with 230 acres 
fenced, has some good stock, improved machinery, an orchard, a vineyard, and vegetable 
gurden. There are also connected with the college well equipped chemical and physical  
-P-A-G-E-528

laboratories, with the necessary apparatus, a drawing academy well fitted out, a com- 
plete set of meteorological instruments from the United States Signal Office, a series of 
shops, with a steam engine and the latest and most approved kinds of tools and machinery, 
and many other things necessary for practical illustration and instruction in the branches 
taught. There were 127 students reported, all taking the full course, under 9 instructors. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological departments are reported in Baylor University, Independence (Baptist), and 
in Trinity University, Tehuacana (Cumberland Presbyterian). Both have full 2 years’ 
courses. The former reports 2 professors and 7 students; the latter, 1 professor and 19 
students. 
There are no schools for legal training reporting, nor in 1881 does there seem to have 
been any for instruction in medicine, the Texas Medical College and Hospital, Galveston, 
the only medical school in the State, having suspended its teaching work because of the 
intention of the regents of the State University to locate the medical school at Galveston.

The Texas Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, founded in 1856, reported the school in 
successful operation in November, 1881, with 6 teachers and 94 pupils, about 30 per cent. 
receiving instruction in articulation. This institution is connected with the State board 
of printing, the State printer giving instruction in that art to the pupils. The printing 
office of the institution is a source of revenue to the State. Shoemaking, farming, and 
aoeer are also taught to the boys, while the girls learn sewing and housework.— 
(Report. x 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Texas Institution for the Blind in 1880 reported 13 instructors (3 of them blind), 
10employés, and 84 pupils. There are 3 departments: literary, musical, and mechanical. 
In the first the common school branches, ancient and modern history, natural philosophy, 
and natural history were taught; in the second, vocal and instrumental music; in the 
third, broom, mattress, and pillow making, cane seating, piano and organ tuning and 
repairing, cutting and sewing, both by hand and machine.— (Report. ) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
A called session of the State Teachers’ Association was held at Austin, January, 1881, 
in the interest of higher education. A memorial embodying a plan of organization for 
the State University was submitted to the governor. The report of the State board of 
education was discussed and adopted as a report of the committee of the association on 
changes in school laws. A resolution urging the inauguration of a system of county 
superintendency was discussed and unanimously passed. 
A regular annual meeting of the State educational association to convene at Corsicana, 
in June, 1881, was announced, but no report of the proceedings is at hand.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of education, elected by the legislature at each biennial ses- 
sion, has general charge of school interests: Local officers are county examining boards 
of 3 members, appointed by town superintendents for the examination of teachers ; town 
superintendents, elected annually by the people ; and in towns where the district system 
has been abolished boards of 3 or 6 directors elected for 3 years, and in districts a mod- 
erator, a clerk, a ¢ollector of taxes, a treasurer, 1 or 3 auditors, and a prudential com- 
mittee of 1 or 3 elected by the people for one year. Any town having a high or central 
school or schools must elect for such high school a prudential committee of not more than 
3 to hold office 3 years, 1 going out each year. A law of 1880 gives women the same 
right as men to hold offices relating to school affairs, also to vote in school district meet- 
ings and for tow clerks, school commissioners, and superintendents. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are supported by district and town taxation, the income of town school 
funds and of the United States deposit fund. The interest on the last is apportioned  
-P-A-G-E-530
    
252 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
on the basis of population, One-half the town school moneys is apportioned according 
to the number of children between 5 and 20 attending public schools, the other half 
among the districts equally without regard to population, except when the sum amounts 
to $1,200 or more, in which case two-thirds of it are apportioned on the basis of attend- 
ance. Towns failing to assess school taxes forfeit to the county a sum equal to double 
the amount required to be raised by such tax, with costs. Each town must sustain one 
or more schools in which the common school branches are taught, including free hand 
drawing, history, the Constitution of the United States, and good behavior. The attend- 
ance of children between 8 and 14 is compelled for at least 3 months in the year unless 
they have been otherwise instructed. The employment by manufacturers of children 
between 10 and 14 that have not attended the public schools at least 3 months during 
the preceding year is forbidden. Parents, guardians, and employers render themselves 
liable to a penalty of from $10 to $20 for an infraction of the law. Any town may 
establish one or more higher schools if the voters desire it. Teachers must have legal 
certificates of qualification to teach in order to be entitled to pay from public funds ; and 
they must make report of school statistics annually to the district clerk or forfeit their 
pay. Town superintendents must report annually to the State superintendent, and the 
latter biennially to the legislature. The State superintendent is required to hold annual 
county institutes for teachers whenever so requested in writing by a certain number of 
teachers, and when not so requested he may hold educational meetings if in his judgment. 
it shall seem best.— (Revised school law. ) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics presented show that 1,094 more pupils were in average attendance on the 
public schools than in 187980, although there were 6 fewer school districts reported and 
36 fewer public schools, bringing the reported enrolment 592 below that of the preceding 
year. The number of teachers employed (comprising fewer men and more women) was 
greater by 93 ; the number who had attended Vermont normal schools was greater ; the 
average montlily pay of men was increased by $1.92, and that of women, already smaller 
than elsewhere in the United States, was decreased by 60 cents. Less money by $7,033 
mee expended for all public school purposes, although $37,340 more were received for 
m. 
The ungraded district schools, in which are enrolled about six-sevenths of the pupils 
attending public schools, are not accomplishing, it is said, what they should. Oneof 
the reasons given for this is the collection of population in business centres, leaving t) 
rural districts thinly populated and reducing the size of the district schools. The pupils 
being young and taxes high, cheap teachers are too frequently employed. School-houses 
and surroundings are often neglected and pupils leave at an early age. In some instances 
these hindrances have been overcome by a few energetic persons, and so a number of the 
best schools in the State are among the ungraded. In these districts school-houses are 
well cared for, good teachers are employed, and wise supervision is given. But such 
instances are exceptional. A majority of the ungraded schools greatly need improve- 
ment and public sentiment demands that it be made. Among desirable changes in the 
course of study the superintendent suggests the simplification of text books on arithmetic 
and the omission of many unimportant details in geography and history, thus saving 
time for reading and language lessons and elementary work in the natural sciences. 
Graded schools have been steadily increasing in number during the last 30 years and 
now enroll over 10,000 pupils. There has also been an improvement in these schools, 
particularly in primary departments. It is suggested, however, that in these schools 
there may be danger of crowding the courses of study too full, of giving too much atten- 
tion to cee and thus of sacrificing the interests of the scholar to the system.— (State

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Burlington ranked its schools as primary, intermediate, grammar, and high. It also 
maintained two evening schools. Out of the 33 teachers in 1881, 24 were holders of 
high school, normal school, or collegiate diplomas, though only 2 of them were from the 
normal schools of Vermont. Special teachers of drawing, writing and book-keeping, 
and of vocal music were employed in addition to the 33 enumerated, and also 6 pupil 
teachers as there was occasion for them. Enrolment and average attendance increased, 
and tardiness diminished. Corporal punishment was rarely inflicted. A taste for read- 
ing was encouraged and good books were supplied. 
Rutland had 12 schools, graded as primary, secondary, intermediate, grammar, and high. 
The superintendent, in the interests of school improvement, advises more thorough ex- 
amination of teachers, their permanent employment, an increase in the pay of women, 
and a change from the district to the town system. 
‘ TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The three normal schools, at Castleton, Johnson, and Randolph, are only in a certain 
sense State institutions. The State owns no property in them and they are not under 
its exclusive control, but a certain amount of money is appropriated to them each year. 
This, in 1880-’81, amounted to $7,300. Each school receives $250 every half year and 
$250 more on condition that the trustees furnish a like amount for current expenses. 
The State also pays for one scholarship from each town at the rate of $24a year. As 
the number of scholarships applied for exceeded that of the towns and doubts had 
arisen as to the method of distribution, a more definite legal enactment was called for. 
The Johnson and Randolph schools report 359 normal students (all but 96 of them 
women) and 51 graduates. The school at Castleton sends no statistics for 1880-’81, be- 
cause of a change of principal without transfer of records. Each school has 2 courses 
of study, elementary and advanced. Graduates from the first receive a State license to 
teach in the public schools for a term of five years. Those from the second receive a 
license to teach for 10 years. 
TRAINING SCHOOL DEPARTMENTS OF GRADED SCHOOLS. 
Departments for instructing teachers may be organized and conducted under the 
eral direction of the State superintendent in graded schools situated in counties in which 
there is no normal school. The certificates of graduation have the same power 98 nor- 
mai school certificates. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
‘The law requires the State superintendent to hold a teachers’ institute in each county 
if he be requested to do so in writing by 25 teachers or in sparsely settled counties by 
15; and, if in his judgment it be best, he may hold from 2 to 5 educational meetings in 
counties where teachers have not requested institutes. He may employ assistants and 
spend $12 of the public money for each meeting. 
Institutes and other educational meetings were held in all the counties during the two 
years covered by the report, but their statistics for 1880-’81 cannot be given, not be- 
ing reported apart from those of the other year. In March, 1881, at a meeting of the 
superintendents of Chittenden County, it was voted to hold an educational meeting in 
every town of the county during the year, and such meetings were actually held in 11 
towns. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIO HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Provision is made for instruction in the higher branches in any district having more 
than one school, subject to the will of the voters of the district ; and any town may by 
vote establish one,or more central schools for advanced pupils. Arrangements are made, 
too, under certain circumstances, by prudential committees, for the instruction of public 
school pupils in academies. 
There were during the year 1,818 pupils attending public high schools, of whom 700 
studied Latin or Greek or both, 117 were graduated, and 59 fitted for college. Many 
persons disapprove of the prominence given to classical studies in these schools and urge 
the greater importance of the sciences as the basis of industrial pursuits; while, it is 
said, the professions. are overcrowded, there is a demand for akilled workmen, and the 
useful artisan must have a knowledge of scientific methods. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and for a summary, see 
corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding.

  254 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Vermont, Burlington (non-sectarian), offers departments of study in 
the arts, in applied science, and in medicine, the first two being open to young women 
on the same terms as to young men. The department of arts comprises the usual course 
in languages, mathematics, physical sciences, mental, moral, and political philosophy, 
rhetoric, literature, and history. For admission to the academic department applicents 
must be at least 16 years old, must pass an examination in English studies, mathe- 
matics, and Latin and Greek, or have certificates from some preparatory school whose 
course of study is approved. In the latter case they are on probation during the first 
term. The scientific and medical departments of the university will be noted further 
on. 
An addition of about 300 volumes was made to the library during the year, more than 
half of them public documents. The museum, also, received a number,of interesting 
additions, among them a collection of Indian curiosities made by Capt. O. B. Read, 
Eleventh United States Infantry, illustrating the usages and habits of the Indians of 
the Northwest. But the most considerable gift received during the year was one of 
$50,000 from John P. Howard, esq., of Burlington, for the endowment of a chair of 
natural history. The surplus of the income above the salary is to be applied to the 
enlargement of the cabinets and the library. 
Middlebury College, Middlebury (Congregationalist), exclusively for young men, received 
gifts amounting to $87,000 during the year. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Besides the opportunities for a higher education afforded young women in the State 
University, one institution exclusively for them is reported, the Vermont Methodist 
Seminary and Female College, Montpelier. It is authorized to confer degrees, and pre- 
sents 7 distinct courses of study, among them a classical and a Latin scientific, each of 
4 years. The modern languages, business, and music also receive special attention. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIBNTIFIC. 
The State Agricultural College of Vermont, a department of the State University, pro- 
vides courses of study in agriculture and related branches, chemistry, engineering, and 
mining, leading to the degrees of PH. B., C. E., and M. E. Applicants for admission 
must be at least 15 years old and must pass an examination in the common English 
branches, algebra through quadratic equations, and plane geometry. A winter course 
has been arranged for the benefit of farmers who cannot attend in the summer or autumn. 
In this the aim is to give only a general outline of the subjects treated, to point out the 
best methods of study and most trustworthy sources of information, to stimulate and 
guide private study, and thus prepare the way for more intelligent work on the farm. 
Lewis College, formerly Norwich University, Northfield, for 1880-’81 reports 20 pupils 
in a 4 years’ scientific course of study and 4 graduates who received the degree of B. 8., 
a library numbering about 4,000 books, and grounds and buildings valued at $20,000. 
For further statistics, see Table X of the appendix, and for asummary, see a correspond- 
ing table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
No theological or legal schools report from this State. 
The medical department of the University of Vermont, Burlington, reports for 1881 a 
class of 171 (the largest that ever attended the institution) and 50 graduates out of 56 
candidates for graduation. In the regular course, the lecture terms of which occupy only 
17 weeks each, the seven required branches of medical science are treated. Candidates 
for graduation must have attended at least two lecture courses and must have studied 
medicine 3 years, including the 2 required lecture terms. Chemical work is not obliga- 
tory, nor is a knowledge of medical botany essential to a diploma, and no examination 
for admission is required. In addition to the régular courses, lectures are given on a 
variety of medical topics by distinguished specialists, and a preliminary course lasting 
nearly 5 months may be attended. Ample opportunities for clinical study are afforded 
by the Mary Fletcher Hospital, whose grounds adjoin those of the university. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
Vermont has no institution for the instruction of the deaf, the blind, or the feeble- 
minded, but makes provision for their education in the American Asylum, Hartford,
-P-A-G-E-533
  
VERMONT. 255 
  Conn.; the Clarke Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Northampton, Mass.; the Perkins Institu- 
tion and Massachusetts School for the Blind, Boston; and the Massachusetts School for 
the Feeble-Minded, Boston. 
According to a report from the deputy secretary of state, there were maintained during 
two years at the American Asylum 17 deaf-mutes and at the Clarke Institution, 4, mak- 
ing 21 in both, at a cost to the State of $7,120.37; at the Perkins Institution, 8 blind 
pupils, at a cost of $4,850; at the Massachusetts School for the Feeble-Minded, 3, at a 
cost of $2,316.96. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Vermont Reform School, Vergennes, gives instruction to boys and girls in the 
common English branches and geometry ; also, in farm, shop, and house work, besides 
the religious and moral training, which is considered more important than all else. 
There were 102 under instruction during 1880-’81, committed by the county and city 
courts and by parents and guardians. All were native born and all boys but 19. This 
school desires not to be classed with penal institutions, its design being not to punish, 
but to educate and preserve. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHAN AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
Two institutions for orphan and destitute children, the Providence Orphan Asylum 
(Roman Catholic) and the Home for Destitute Children (non-sectarian), both at Burling- 
ton, had a total of 172 children under instruction during the year. The Home for Des- 
titute Children is supported by an endowment and contributions ; admits children one to 
ten years of age, instructing them in the common English branches and in cane seating. 
Providence Orphan Asylum is supported by voluntary gifts ; admits children two to ten ; 
and, besides the common English branches, teaches them farming and housework. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-first annual meeting of the Vermont Teachers’ Association was held at 
Northfield, August 10-12, 1881. After an address of welcome by Rev. W. S. Hazen and 
response by President Cilley, a paper on ‘‘The province of the State in education,’’ by Rev. 
George B. Gow, D. D., was read. On the following day an address was delivered on ‘‘ The 
spiritual significance of education,’’? by Principal O. S. Johnson, Bakersfield. ‘‘ How 
can the standard of qualification for teachers be raised?’’ was discussed by Prof. Charles 
N. Dole and others. Mr. Dole thought the first thing is to create a popular demand 
for better teachers ; another recommended a change in the methods of examination of 
teachers. In the afternoon an address was delivered by Rev. J. D. Emerson, entitled 
“The interrogation point,’’ in which it was urged that teachers should study to make 
themselves perfect in the art of asking questions. Principal Edward Conant, of John- 
son, read a paper on the position of the high school and academy in the school system, 
and Rev. H. T. Fuller, principal of St. Johnsbury Academy, objected to normal depart- 
ments in connection with academical institutions. J. J. Randall, superintendent of 
schools, Rutland, made some remarks to show the desirability of paying more money 
for better teachers. George A. Brown, of Bellows Falls, urged the necessity of a high 
and definite aim in teaching. Hon. Justus Dartt, State superintendent of education, 
spoke on the ungraded schools of the State; and President H. M. Buckham, of the 
University of Vermont, on ‘‘The moral hygiene of the school.’’? On Friday morning, 
after a business session, in which reports were made by committees and officers were 
elected for the ensuing year, a paper on ‘‘The life and work of Mrs. Fannie K. Kyle” 
was read by Miss Alice M. Guernsey, of Saxton’s River. Rev. H. T. Fuller, of St. 
Johnsbury Academy, presented a paper entitled ‘‘ Among the schools of Europe,’’? and 
Lyndon A. Smith, of Norwich, now connected with the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation, a paper on ‘‘The teacher’s need and means of growth.”’ 
VERMONT COLLEGE OF TEACHERS. 
The above organization, incorporated in 1881, was formed by the leading educators of 
the State for the advancement of educational interests. One of its aims is to secure the 
recognition of teaching as a profession, ‘‘and make prominent the distinction between 
the teacher and the educational tramp.’’ The first public meeting was advertised to be 
held August 9, 1881, but no account of its proceedings has been received.— (Journal of 
Education.)

  STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The free school system is administered by a superintendent of public instruction, 
elected by the general assembly for 4 years; a State board of education, composed of the’ 
superintendent, the governor, and the attorney general; county superintendents, ap- 
pointed by the State board and confirmed by the senate for 4 years; district school 
trustees, appointed by a school trustee electoral board composed of the county superin- 
tendent, the county judge, and the county attorney; and subdistrict school directors. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all persons of school age residing within the school dis- 
trict ; but white and colored persons are taught in separate schools. The number of free 
schools is regulated, according to the funds available for the purpose, by the State board of 
education, whose duty it is to guard against so great a multiplication of schools as will 
lower the character of instruction. Where the number of children is sufficient, preference 
is given to graded schools. The schools receive for their support (1) State funds, embrac- 
ing the annual interest of the literary fund, a capitation tax not exceeding $1 on all 
men over 21, and a property tax of not less than 1 nor more than 5 mills on $1 (as the 
general assembly shall from time to time order); (2) county funds, embracing fines, pen- 
alties, and donations, and a tax not to exceed 10 cents on $100; and (3) district funds, 
embracing fines, penalties, and a tax not to exceed 10 cents on $100. Cities of the first 
class (those having a population of 10,000 or upwards) and cities and towns of the sec- 
ond class (comprising all other cities) may levy, for the support of public free schools, 
a tax not to exceed 3 mills on $1 and a capitation tax not to exceed 50 cents for all pur- 
poses. The State fund is apportioned by the State superintendent of public instruction 
among the several counties and cities on the basis of the number of children from 5 to 
21, as ascertained by a census taken every five years and by the best official authority at 
other times. School districts, to receive State money, must provide school-houses, fur- 
niture, and all necessary appliances, and no school may receive State funds that has not 
been taught 5 months during the year. Teachers’ certificates, good for 1 or 2 years, 
according to the ability, experience, and success of the applicants, are given by the county 
superintendents. From among the number holding such certificates teachers are chosen 
by subdistrict directors; but they are employed by the district trustees. Each county 
superintendent is required to hold at least one teachers’ institute during the year, which 
the teachers are expected to attend ; and, if this attendance should cover any part of a 
school term, they are not to lose pay for the time spent at the institute. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Asked by the State superintendent whether any progress was made in 1881 in school 
organization or methods of teaching, a majority of the county superintendents answer 
afiirmatively, some of them reporting decided progress and improvement, especially in 
the schools whose teachers attended the normal institutes. A comparison of statistics 
for 1880 and 1881 shows a positive gain at almost every point, the most noticeable facts 
being an increase of 18,310 in enrolment and of 6,083 in average attendance, which was 
met by an increase of 528 schools. An increase of 29 in the number of graded schools 
and of 877 in the number of pupils studying higher branches also marks improvement 
in teaching. The normal institutes held by means of aid from the Peabody fund in 1880 
and 1881 have been a great benefit to the schools by improving the methods of instruc- 
tion in them. The State superintendent hopes to interest the legislature in these schools, 
so as to secure State aid for them. 
  AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
Aid to the amount of $5,150 was received by this State in 1880-’81. Of this the sum 
of $3,000 was expended for teachers’ institutes; $1,450 for scholarships, to enable selected 
Virginia teachers to study at the Normal College, Nashville, Tenn. ; $200 for the Educa- 
tional Journal; and $500 for Hampton Normal Institute. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Three schools of this#lass report for 1881: the American Kindergarten, Lynchburg;

  258 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
Cities not divided into wards constitute a single district; in cities divided into wards, 
each ward constitutes a school district. The control of school affairs is in the hands of 
a school board composed of not more than 3 trustees from each district. 
All cities of 10,000 or more inhabitants must (and all others may) have a city superin- 
tendent of schools, appointed by the State board of education, subject to confirmation by 
the senate.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Alexandria valued its school property in 1881 at $49,400 and reported 4 school build- 
ings, with 21 rooms and 1,150 sittings for study. The schools were graded as primary 
and grammar, pupils in the seventh grammar grade receiving instruction in some of the 
higher English branches, such as physical geography, algebra, and geometry. The 
length of session was 180 days ; 5 men and 14 women were employed as teachers. There 
was a gain of about 4 per cent. in enrolment of white and of 35 per cent. in enrolment 
of colored pupils, the latter attributed to the closing of a Protestant Episcopal church 
school for colored pupils and of one or two private schools. The average attendance of 
colored childen, notwithstanding a severe winter, increased nearly 37 per cent., a greater 
ratio than the increase in enrolment, while the average attendance among whites in- 
creased only 2 per cent. There were 629 cases of corporal punishment reported as 
-against 1,073 for 1880, and 1,019 cases of tardiness against 916 for 1880. An estimated 
enrolment of 1,100 is given for private schools.— (City report ). 
Danville reported through the State superintendent graded schools for both white and 
colored children. Those for whites, with 7 grades, were taught by 8 teachers for 10 
months, with an enrolment of 414 and an average daily attendance of 223; those for 
colored had also 7 grades, with 7 teachers, a session of 6 months, and an enrolment of 580, 
with 285 in average attendance.— (State report.) 
Lynchburg reported 5 buildings, with 32 rooms and 1,350 sittings, valued at $56,000. 
The schools are graded as primary, grammar, and high, and were taught 194 days by 1 
‘colored and 7 white men, 4 colored and 20 white women. An enrolmentof 119, with an 
average attendance of 88, was given for the high school. Private schools enrolled 500.— 
(State report and return.) 
Norfolk reported to the State superintendent 18 public schools for whites and 10 for 
colored, taught for 190 days by 18 white and 8 colored teachers. The schools are graded 
and under the charge of 5 principals for white and 2 for colored. The average monthly 
pay of men teaching was $80.12, and of women, $52.63. 
Petersburg reported 6 school-houses containing 28 rooms, valued, with sites, furniture, 
&c., at $57,000. The 4 schools for whites are graded as primary, grammar, and high; 
the 2 for colored, as primary and grammar. The whole enrolment of whites was 33} 
per cent. of the school population, that of colored, 25}, while 93.3 per cent. of average 
daily enrolment of whites and nearly 94 per cent. of the average daily enrolment of col- 
ored were in average daily attendance. The schools were taught 185 days by an efficient 
corps of teachers, 16 women and 12 men, besides a principal and special teacher of pen- 
manship. The superintendent reports the schools as improving at all points. An esti- 
mated enrolment of 1,200 is given for private schools.— (City report and return.) 
Portsmouth reported 14 primary schools, 10 for white and 4 fol@colored children, accom- 
modated in.3 school-houses, with 14 rooms, and valued its school property at $15,500. 
‘The schools were taught 202 days by 14 white teachers, 4 men and 10 women. There 
were 819 enrolled in private schools.— (State report and return. ) 
Richmond expended $18,766 for the construction and improvement of school buildings. 
and for school furniture, and valued its entire school property, thus improved, at $279,081.

VIRGINIA. 259 
Thirteen school-houses were reported, 8 for white and 5 for colored pupils ; 12 of these 
contained 82 white and 51 colored schools, divided into 91 primary and 40 grammar 
grades, with two high schools, taught by 126 white and 17 colored teachers. With a 
school population of more than 20,000 and an enrolment of 6,993, there were sittings 
for only 6,549, showing the need of greater accommodations. The schools were in ses- 
sion for 9 months. The average daily attendance in this year, as in other years, was 
good, averaging 94.4 per cent. in white schools and 97 per cent. in colored on the aver- 
age monthly enrolment. The high school for whites, with an enrolment of 282 pursuing 
a3 years’ course (including Latin, modern languages, and some branches of natural sci- 
ence), had 15 graduates, 13 girls and 2 boys, in 1881. The colored normal school reported 
a 3 years’ English course of a lower grade than the high school ; as the model school in 
connection with it has been discontinued for want of room and the normal instruction is 
limited, the superintendent recommends a further course of normal instruction for its 
graduates as well as for those of the high school ; with an enrolment of 290, there were 
10 graduates, 8 young men and 2 young women.— (City report.) . 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
The normal schools reporting for 1881 are Bridgewater Normal School, organized in 
1873; Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, organized in 1868 for colored and 
Indian students; St. Stephen’s Normal School, Petersburg, organized in 1871 for colored 
youth; and the Richmond Normal School for colored. The first mentioned reports 87 
students, but makes no distinction as to what number were in the normal department. 
Hampton had 48 instructors in all its departments, 305 normal students, 80 Indians, 
and 41 graduates from the 3 years’ normal course, of whom 38 engaged in teaching. St. 
Stephen’s Normal, under control of the Protestant Episcopal Church, reported 7 in- 
structors and 250 students in all departments, 25 of them in the normal course. The 
Richmond colored normal is a part of the public school system of that city and had 66 
normal students, of whom 9 graduated.— (Returns. ) 
GENERAL TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The Virginia State Institute for Colored Teachers was held in the buildings of the 
Agricultural and Normal Institute, Hampton, June 28 to July 15, 1881, with an aggre- 
gate attendance of 141, The exercises were conducted by Prof. H. P. Warren, of the 
New Hampshire State Normal School, assisted by Misses Reed and Cate, of the same 
institution, and Mr. J. Freeman Hall, of Dedham, Mass. The entire time of the insti- 
tute was devoted to discussions on the development of reading, number work, geography, 
language, and, to some extent, map drawing. 
Two normal institutes for white teachers were held in 1881, one at Abingdon, in the 
buildings of Martha Washington College, the other at Front Royal. The former was con- 
ducted by Dr. M. A. Newell, of Maryland, assisted by Mr. J. P. Thomas, principal of 
Bethel Public School, Richmond; Mr. J. G. Swartz, principal Lexington Public School, 
and Miss Annie Ruffner, daughter of Superintendent Ruffner, a graduate of the New 
Jersey State Normal School. The enrolment, during the 4 weeks the institute lasted, 
reached 287, with an average attendance of 265, representing 25 counties. The work 
was divided into general, class, and optional exercises and lectures. General exercises 
consisted of singing and morning devotions, learning selections from the best English 
authors, the study of history by topics, and lectures on some point of school manage- 
ment or methods of teaching; the ‘‘grading of country schools ’’ was a topic discussed 
with greatinterest. Class exercises consisted in class recitations, for which the students 
were divided into sections; geography and map drawing, arithmetic, grammatical analy- 
sis, object lessons, and reading were the principal subjects taken up. The optional ex- 
ercises (singing, calisthenics, literary and musical soirées) took place out of school hours 
and were largely attended. Seven evening lectures, three by State Superintendent Ruff- 
ner, interested the citizens as well as members of the institute. 
The Front Royal Institute was conducted during its 4 weeks’ term by Dr. Edward 
Brooks, of the State Normal School at Millersville, Pa., assisted by Profs. E. O. Lyte, 
G. W. Hull, J. W. Lansinger, and Miss M. Frances Boice. The work was divided into 
general exercises and class drills. The principal lectured three-quarters of an hour every 
morning on subjects connected with the science and art of teaching. Class drills in 
grammar, vocal musig, mathematics, geography, history, object lessons, reading, and 
elocution were given daily. The teachers formed a reading club, which met out of 
school hours; also, a glee club. These contributed to the evening entertainments fre- 
quently given. State Superintendent Ruffner and others delivered lectures. There 
were 265 in attendance on this institute, including teachers from 53 counties, 10 county 
and several city superintendents.— (State report. )

  260 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
A rule of the State board of education requires the holding of at least one teachers’ 
institute a year in each county by the county superintendent. Of the counties and 
cities reporting to the State superintendent 21 held no institute, while 33 held more 
than one, Lynchburg reporting 14, Petersburg 10, and Alexandria 9.— (State report.) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Educational Journal of Virginia is a monthly publication issued at Richmond. 
Its general department is devoted to education and literature and its official department, 
edited by the State superintendent, gives full information in regard to the State system. 
It is the official organ of the State Teachers’ Association as well as of the State superin- 
tendent. It was in its twelfth volume in 1881. 
. SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The higher branches may be introduced into any school with the sanction of the 
county school board, and may be discontinued at the option of the board. The State 
superintendent reports 8,139 pupils studying higher branches, an increase of 877 over 
the previous year, but gives no definite information as to high schools established. The 
cities of Danville, Lynchburg, Norfolk, and Richmond reported high schools in 1880, 
while Liberty, Lynchburg, Petersburg, Richmond,«Staunton, and Winchester report 
such schools for 1881, or grades that imply the existence of them. The Petersburg 
school had 109 pupils; the Richmond high school for whites, 282 ; the Richmond colored 
normal school, which appears to serve more as a high school for the colored race, 290, of 
whom 66 were reported as normal students. Cumberland College and Turkey Cove Sem- 
inary, Lee County, ranked among the State graded schools (probably as private schools 
receiving public pupils), also indicate high school grades. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix. For summaries of their 
statistics, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN. 
The University of Virginia, Albemarle County (non-sectarian and supported in part 
by the State), is free to students from Virginia over 18 years of age, and offers to suc- 
cessful candidates, residence immaterial, at a competitive examination, 11 scholarships 
good for 1 year, divided among its various departments. The undergraduate studies are 
arranged in 12 schools, viz: Latin, including instruction in Sanserit ; Greek, including 
Hebrew, if desired; modern languages (including French, German, Italian, Spanish, 
and Anglo-Saxon); moral philosophy ; history, general literature, and rhetoric ; mathe- 
matics, pure and mixed ; natural philosophy ; general and applied chemistry ; applied 
mathematics ; analytical and agricultural chemistry ; agriculture, zodlogy, and botany, 
and natural history and geology. There are also departments of medicine, law, and 
agriculture. An aggregate of 357 students in all schools and departments was given. 
In 1877 Mr. Leander J. McCormick, of Chicago, offered to the university a great re- 
fracting telescope which he had had constructed at a cost of nearly $50,000, on condi- 
tion that the funds necessary to erect an observatory and endow a chair of astronomy be 
raised by the university. In April, 1881, it was announced that the amount had been 
raised, Mr. W. H. Vanderbilt, of New York, contributing $25,000 and other friends re- 
siding in the State giving $50,000. Mr. McCormick then added $18,000 for the erection 
of the observatory, which was commenced at once. 
To-+the museum of natural history and geology provided for by Mr. Lewis Brooks, of 
Rochester, N. Y., in 1875, at a cost of $68,000, and since improved by others at a further 
cost of $12,000, Mr. Brooks’s brothers are reported by the visitors of the university in 
1880-’81 to have added a valuable botanical collection by a gift of $4,000. 
Of the 6 other institutions of this class reporting for 1881, the Randolph Macon Col- 
lege, Ashland; Washington and Lee University, Lexington; and Richmond College, Rich- 
mond, arrange the courses of study, like the University of Virginia, in separate schools. 
Emory and Henry College, Emory; Hampden Sidney College, Hampden Sidney; and 
Roanoke College, Salem, have preparatory departments and a 4 years’ classical course, 
with opportunity for some scientific study. William and Mary College, Williamsburg, 
is understood to have almost wholly suspended its instruction from want of funds.

INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN, 
For names and full statistics of institutions for the higher education of young women, 
see Table VIII of the appendix, and a summary thereof in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
Scientific instruction is found in 3 of the regular colleges reporting, Emory and Henry 
College offering a 3 years’ scientific course and Washington and Lee University and the 
University of Virginia courses in civil engineering and general science, the last named 
adding mining engineering and a course in agriculture, zodlogy, and botany of 2 to 3 
years, with a well stocked museum for illustration of the instruction given and an ex- 
perimental farm for practice. 
. The separate scientific schools reporting for 1880—’81 are (1) the Virginia Agricultural 
and Mechanical College, Blacksburg, organized in 1872, which offers free tuition to State 
students, enjoys part of the congressional land grant, and has a scientific course of 4 
years, leading, with practical work on the farm and in the shop, to the degree of grad- 
uate in agriculture or in mechanics; (2) Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, 
Hampton, which, organized in 1868 for the education of the-colored race and since 
opened to Indians also, receives the benefit of a portion of the land grant and offers a 
3 years’ course, the first 2 years including elementary studies and the last higher math- 
ematics and some scientific instruction, as well as opportunity for practice on the farm, 
in the household, and in the shops; (3) the Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, 
founded in 1839, which receives an annual appropriation for its support from the State 
and provides for one State cadet from each senatorial district. A 4 years’ course includes 
instruction in the natural sciences, civil and military engineering, and mechanical draw- 
ing. A graduate course in a special school of applied. science is also offered. 
The Polytechnic Institute, New Market, has not reported since 1880. 
For statistics, see Table X of the appendix; for a summary of them, the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
  PROFESSIONAL. 
\ The theological schools reporting are Union Theological Seminary, Hampden Sidney 
(Presbyterian), 1824; Richmond Institute, Richmond (Baptist), 1867; Theological Sem- 
inary of the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod South, Salem, 1832; and the Protes- 
tant Episcopal Theological Seminary of Virginia, Theological Seminary P. O., 1823. An 
examination for admission of applicants who are not college graduates is required by all 
and full 3 years’ courses are offered. At the last named there is also a preparatory 
course. Richmond Institute, which is for colored students, has 3 years’ preparatory and 
3 years’ academic courses before the theological. For statistics, see Table XI of the 
appendix, and for a summary, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
‘The institutions having a department for legal instruction are Richmond College, the 
University of Virginia, and Washington and Lee University. All offer a 2 years’ course, 
which, at the option of the student, may be completed in one year, although the full 2 
years’ course, of 9 months each year, is advised. Washington and Lee University per- 
mits students devoting 2 years to the course in law to pursue certain academic studies 
at the same time, without additional expense. For statistics, see Table XII of the 
appendix; and for summaries of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Medical instruction is given in the medical department of the University of .Virginia 
and in the Medical College of Virginia, Richmond. Both have graded courses of 2 years 
(each of 9 months) and daily examinations on the studies of the preceding day and course. 
In the former no examination for admission is required, and students able to pass exam- 
ination on the studies of the 2 years may graduate in one year. The latter requires one 
year’s study with a reputable physician before admission, as well as attendance on 2 full 
lecture courses, and will admit no student to examination for the degree who has not 
dissected for at least one session. 
Pharmaceutical students, by attendance on the lectures of the Medical College of Vir- 
ginia, after passing a satisfactory examination, may receive a diploma in pharmacy. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Virginia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Staunton, founded in 
1839, has received since that time 530 deaf-mute and 253 blind students. The depart-  
-P-A-G-E-540
  262 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ment for tbe deaf and dumb for 1881 reports 96 pupils taught the common English 
branches, history, free hand drawing, and painting in oil; also, carpentry, painting, shoe- 
making, printing, cabinet making, bookbinding, sewing, and fancy work. ‘The depart- 
ment for the blind had 32 pupils receiving instruction in a full course of common and 
higher English branches, French, and vocal and instrumental music ; also, instruction 
in broom making, cane seating, mattress making, fancy and bead work. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, for Indian and negro students, gives 
instruction in various industries. The students work on the farm, in the sawmill, in 
the brickyard, in the shops at trades, in the sewing and tailoring departments, in the 
household and in the kitchen garden, receiving pay for their labor. They were enabled 
in 1881 to earn $24,898, which sum, with the addition of a small amount paid by some 
students, was sufficient, as tuition is free, to cover the expense of board, clothing, &c., 
for all colored students. 
The Miller Manual Labor School, of Albemarle, so named after the late Samuel Miller, 
under whose will it was established, combines training in industries with study in the 
school. The latter is attended to from 8 to 1 o’clock on all school days, with half an 
hour of recess; the former occupies about two hours of the afternoon. Every boy is 
expected to work in the shop, in the printing office, on the farm, or in the garden, learn- 
ing the use of mechanical tools, the best modes of feeding and caring for stock, of culti- 
vating orchards, vineyards, gardens, and lawns; of planting crops, tending and gathering 
them; of setting type, printing books, and managing a telegraph —all with a view to prep- 
aration for earning an honest livelihood. The endowment of the school is ample, its 
buildings are good, and its officers of high repute for excellence. Its immediate benefits 
are limited to children 10 to 14 years of age of the county in which it is, who are either 
orphans or of parents unable to educate them. Since its organization, in 1878, there had 
been 124 received, of whom 100 were on the roll in 1881, under a superintendent and 4 
instructors, with a matron.— (Report and return, 1881.) 
Five orphan asylums send returns for 1880-’81. All seem to be exclusively for girls, 
and teach sewing and household work in addition to the elementary English branches. 
One at Lynchburg was handsomely endowed by Mr. Samuel Miller, before spoken of, 
and he was buried in its grounds. One in Lawrenceville, Brunswick County, with 90 
boys and 135 girls, under 2 teachers, was for the education and elevation of the destitute 
children of the old plantation negroes of that region. For statistics of all that report 
them, see Tables XX and XXII of the appendix. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
VIRGINIA STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The sixteenth annual meeting was held in the hall of the Norfolk College for Young 
Ladies, July 5-6, 1881, and discussed such topics as the true sphere of the association, 
the geological and mineral interests of Virginia as affecting the future status of its schools, 
the practical utility of natural history in developing the industrial resources of the State, 
the educational needs of southern women and the means of meeting them, English lan- 
guage and literature, Greek, Latin, modern languages, algebra, geometry, &c. Secondary 
education received considerable attention, and was referred to a special committee for 
further consideration and for report at the next meeting. The need of endowment funds 
for educational institutions was dwelt upon by Professor Dreher, of Roanoke College, and 
legislation by Congress and by State legislatures for the support of schools and for the 
education of the people through them found an eloquent advocate in Hon. John Goode, 
of the Committee on Education and Labor of the United States House of Representatives. 
The meeting is said to have been more numerously attended than the last, and the 
speakers were almost wholly representative men, of large ability, including Superintend- 
ent Ruffner and professors and principals of important educational institutions of the 
State. The meeting for 1882 was appointed to be held at Charlottesville, August 21 
and 22.

264 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the State these continued to be a superintendent of free schools, chosen by the 
people for the term of 4 years; a State ‘‘ board of the school fund,’’ consisting of the 
governor, superintendent, auditor, and treasurer ; a board of regents of the State normal 
school, consisting of the State superintendent and one person appointed by the governor 
from each congressional district; and a board of regents of the university, containing 
one person from each senatorial district, also appointed by the governor. 
For each county there continued to be a superintendent of free schools, elected by the 
voters every 2 years, and a county board of examiners, consisting of the county super- 
intendent and 2 experienced teachers, chosen by the presidents of the district boards of 
education in the county. For each school district in the county there was chosen by the 
people a board of education of 3 members, to continue in office 2 years.'_ For each sub- 
district into which a district may be divided, there were 3 trustees appointed by the dis- 
trict board of education. Directors of a high school formed by the concurrent action 
of 2 or more districts are selected or removed at the discretion of the boards of education 
of said districts. 
  OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The State schools are free to all youth 6 to 21 years of age in the districts where estab- 
lished. Sufficient primary schools are to be provided for the instruction of all youth in 
the district entitled to attend; but separate schools for white and colored children are 
the rule, and there are separate funds for each. The elementary English studies only 
are required to be taught, but boards of education may add other studies. High and 
graded schools are authorized in districts where they are needed, subject, in all cases, to 
the vote of the people in said district whenever an additional tax is involved. Only duly 
licensed teachers are to be employed, who must keep the required registers of attendance, 
of studies, and of the number engaged in each, and make the required monthly and term 
reports to the secretaries of their respective boards, or forfeit the pay due them at the 
time. The school month consists of 22 days; the year for teaching, of 4 such months, 
unless a vote of the people in a district should call for a longer term. The free schools 
are sustained from the proceeds of a fund derived from the sale of United States land 
warrants; by an annual tax of 10 cents on the $100, with $1 capitation tax on each male, 
citizen; by the proceeds of forfeitures, confiscations, and fines of the previous year ; and 
by the income from such bank stock and United States bonds as may be held by the 
board of the school fund; while districts are required to raise enough, with the aid of 
the State money, to keep the primary schools open for at least 4 months in the year, the 
district tax in any year, however, not to exceed 50 cents on the $100, and the fund thus 
raised being used exclusively for teachers’ salaries. For school-houses and all expenses 
beyond teachers’ salaries, 40 cents on the $100 may be levied; while, for graded schools 
beyond the primary, 15 cents on the $100 and, for a high school, 30 cents on the $100 
are allowed.— (School Jaws.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
According to the State superintendent’s review of the year, the outlook of popular 
education in the State was never brighter. The signs of general progress were the de- 
mand for better teachers; an increase, in some localities, of teachers’ salaries; an im- 
provement in methods of teaching; an increased interest on the part of parents; and 
improved school buildings, with better furniture and apparatus. The legislature of 1881 
increased the duties and compensation of county superintendents, which resulted in an 
increased number of county educational meetings. That the colored people may have 
well trained teachers of their own race, the same legislature provided for the free educa- 
tion of 18 colored students at Storer College, Harper’s Ferry, the selection to be made 
by the State superintendent from 9 appointment districts. 
The statistics of 1880-’81, as compared with those of 1879-80, show that, with an in- 
creased school population of 3,078, there was an additional enrolment of 2,353. The 
scholars were well provided for in 116 more ungraded and 3 more high schools, public 
graded schools, however, falling off 10. The average school term was 2 days shorter. 
Female teachers increased by 178 and the whole number of teachers by 153, a fair pro- 
portion to the new school-houses and enrolment. In the valuation of school property 
there was a gain of $82,609; in receipts, of $64,383; in expenditures, of $44,386; and in 
permanent fund, of $17,958. The only falling off, besides those before mentioned, was 
a decrease of 187 in colored pupils enrolled; of 438 in whole average daily attendance, 
about equally divided between whites and colored; of 25 in the number of male teachers, 
made up by an increase of females employed; and a slight decrease in the average 
monthly pay of teachers.

PEABODY FUND. 
The amount given to the State in 1881 was $2,000, to be used in aid of teachers’ insti- 
tutes and of normal schools for the training of teachers. 
NEW SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 
The colored people of the State having been to a large extent without competent teach- 
ers of their own race, the legislature of 1881 introduced into the school law a provision 
that the State superintendent of free schools should make arrangements with some suit- 
able institution of learning in the State for the normal training of a number of colored 
school teachers, bearing to the colored population of the State a proportion equalling that 
borne to the white population by the non-paying white students in the State normal 
schools, the sum to be paid for each of these new pupils not to exceed that for each non- 
paying white pupil. The law was promptly carried into effect through an appropriation 
made for the purpose by the legislature. . 
A considerable revision of the general school law also appears to have been made, in- 
creasing the duties and compensation of county superintendents and making the pay of 
teachers largely depend on the grade of their certificates of qualification. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
WHEELING. 
Officers. — At the latest date of definite information the officers continued to be a board 
of education of 3 members from each subdistrict, with a superintendent of the city school 
district, appointed by the board and required to have had at least 3 years of successful 
practice in graded schools. 
Statistics. Wheeling, with a population of 30,737 in 1880-’81, had 10,673 children of 
school age, averaging 10} years old, the males and females being of nearly equal num- 
bers, with only 270 colored youth. Of these, 4,917, or 46 per cent., were enrolled, while 
3,156 were in average daily attendance, which, although only 30 per cent. of the school 
population, was 64 per cent. of theenrolment. There were 8 brick school buildings, con- 
taining 8 graded schools, with 93 teachers, 83 holding first grade and 10 second grade cer- 
tificates. School property was valued at $236,680, while expenditures for the year 
amounted to $60,248. 
Additional particulars.—According to a new plan of organization and course of study, 
adopted in 1881, the highest department of each school is to be called a grammar school, 
all the subordinate departments are to constitute a primary school, and each is to bear 
the name of the subdistrict in which it is located. 'The grammar schools are to be of 4 
grades, each covering a year; the primary, of 4 divisions, each with as many grades or 
sections as the superintendent may deem necessary or expedient. No high school is 
provided for, but the studies of the grammar grades include several subjects usually ina 
high school course, without, however, any foreign language.— (State report for 1881.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The normal school of the State, established under act of 1867 as a department of Mar- 
shall College, Huntington, is under the control of a board of regents, assisted by a local 
committee. The same is the case with its 4 branches at Fairmont (1869), West Liberty 
(1871), Glenville, and Shepherdstown (1873). The course of study in each school con- 
tinued to be of 3 years. Upon its completion normal diplomas are granted by the State 
superintendent under authority of the regents, the holders of them, however, to be sub- 
ject to examination by the county superintendents after 1882. Tuition and books were 
free to State students agreeing to teach 1 year in the free schools of the State. To these 
schools 600 students, divided among the counties according to population, may receive 
appointments. Boys appointed must be 14 and girls 13 years of age. 
Storer College, Harper’s Ferry (1867), besides affording preparatory and academic courses 
for colored pupils, gives normal training, and for 1880-81 reported 8 instructors and 170 
normal students, including 18 selected colored teachers supported by the State. Of the 
whole, 13 were graduated, 10 of whom engaged in teaching. This college had a library 
of 3,100 volumes, increased by 200 during the year, while instruction was given in draw- 
ing and in vocal and instrumental music. 
Bethany College offered in 1880-81 a teachers’ course in natural philosophy of 6 to 10 
weeks, affording laboratory work in verification and illustration of the instruction given. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
During 1881 there were 60 county and 5 district institutes held, with a total enrol- 
ment of 4,410 and an average daily attendance of 4,078. This remarkable attendance  
-P-A-G-E-544
  
266 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
was attributed to the compulsory provision of the institute law and the emyloyment of 
well known competent teachers, while out of these gatherings came an improved condi- 
tion in school affairs. The 5 district institutes were held at Parkersburg, Fairmont, 
Charlestown, Lewisburg, and Wheeling, each continuing 5 days, under the personal 
supervision of the State superintendent, with Prof. E. V. De Graff, of Paterson, N. J., 
and Prof. J. J. Ladd, of Staunton, Va., as instructors at the first 4 mentioned, and several 
other distinguished teachers at the last. The expenses, except the janitor fees, were paid 
from the Peabody fund. These were regarded as the most successful institutes ever held 
in the State. 
WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOL JOURNAL. 
A useful paper under this title issued its first monthly number in November, 1881. 
Besides many articles for the benefit of teachers, it presents much interesting information 
as to current school matters in the State. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
FREE HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The law of the State authorizes the organization of high schools in single districts or in 2 
or more combined districts where there are advanced students needing the higher instruc- 
tion of such schools. Eleven were reported for 1880-’81, a gain of 3 on the previous 
year, but, as then, without statistics of attendance, &c. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For business colleges and private academic schools, see Tables IV and VI of the appen- 
dix; for preparatory departments of colleges, see Table IX; for full summaries of the 
statistics of each class of schools, corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOvH SEXES. 
West Virginia University, Morgantown, 1867 (non-sectarian), continued in 1880-’81 its 
classical, scientific, engineering, and military courses of 4 years each, with a course in 
agriculture of 2 years, while those of law and medicine were not yet fully developed. 
It also provided a preparatory course of 2 years and an optional one of select studies for 
such as might not desire a full course in any of the regular ones; also, a free course of 1 
year in vocal music. During the year there were 12 instructors, with 97 preparatory and 
58 collegiate students, a gain of 30 over the previous year. There were 5,000 volumes in 
the library, which was increased by 250 during the year. University property was valued 
at $110,000, with a productive fund of $109,000, and, for the year, a State appropriation 
of $11,500.— (Catalogue and return.) 
Bethany College, Bethany (Christian), in 1880-81 continued its classical, scientific, and 
ministerial courses of 4 years each and 3 special courses in engineering, physics, and 
chemistry, with an academic preparatory course of 2 years, in some cases reduced to 1 
year; also, irregular and graduate courses—all being open equally to bothsexes. There 
were 8 instructors, with 67 studeats. Graduated since the opening of the college, 575.— 
(Catalogue and return, ) 
West Virginia College, Flemington (Free-Will Baptist), offered preparatory, academic, 
classical, philosophical, literary, normal, and musical courses of 3 years each, with un- 
defined commercial, military, and select courses. It reported 11 instructors and 30 
students in the freshman class, with college property valued at $15,000, and 600 volumes 
in the library.— (Catalogue and return.) : 
Shepherd College, Shepherdstown (non-sectarian), presented no definite collegiate course, 
though it offered collegiate instruction to follow the normal course mentioned under 
Training of Teachers. Two instructors, with 71 normal students, male and female, were 
reported for 1880-’81.— (Catalogue. ) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
West Virginia and Shepherd Colleges continued to admit women to equal privileges 
with men and Bethany College had opened its doors to them. 
For institutions at Clarksburg, Parkersburg, and Wheeling admitting women only, 
see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary of the statistics, the report of the Com- 
missioner preceding.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
West Virginia University continued to offer in 1880-81 its previously mentioned scicn- 
tific course of 4 years for the degree of B. S.; an engineering course, in which the studies 
of the first 3 years are the same as in the scientific, while the senior year is devoted to 
studies belonging directly to that department, including civil and military engineering; 
and an agricultural course of 2 years. 
Bethany College also offered a scientific course of 4 years; a special course in engineer- 
ing, with no fixed time; a teachers’ course in natural philosophy of 6 to 10 weeks; and 
a special course in practical chemistry. 
For statistics of each college, see Table X of the appendix; for a summary of the sta- 
tistics of all reporting, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—As far as known, the ministerial course in Bethany College affords the 
only theological instruction in the State. The course of 4 years embraces the school of 
sacred literature, ofancient languages, of mathematics and astronomy, of natural science 
and mental philosophy, belles lettres, and political economy. It reported 8 students. 
Legal.—In the West Virginia University, the full legal course embraced common, 
statute, and mercantile law, equity, and evidence, with constitutional and international 
law, these last not required of students fitting themselves for ordinary practice. Besides 
daily examinations, there were term examinations at the close of each session; certificates 
of distinction being given to those whose entire examinations had been uniformly good. 
The course appears to cover the university year.— (Catalogue.) 
Medical.—This department of the same university continued in 1880—’81 its lectures 
on anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, the class being made up of those in the junior 
college class who were required to study anatomy and physiology as a part of their course, 
of certain State cadets who elect to take this course, and of regular medical students. 
The interest taken in this course of study, shown by punctual attendance and evident 
comprehension of the instruction given, was very gratifying. The course of instruction 
begins with the winter term, in November, and continues to the close of the university 
year, in June.— (Catalogue. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The West Virginia Institution for the Deafand Dumb and the Blind, Romney (1870), 
gave in its report for the twoyears ending in September, 1880 (the lastreceived), 163 deaf- 
mutes and 54 blind youth as having been instructed in the ten years of its work. Of 
these, 93 deaf-mutes and 31 blind pupils had been graduated or regularly discharged, many 
of whom were then self supporting and industrious men and women. In 1879-80 there 
were 94 deaf and dumb and 36 blind inmates, a total of 130. For 1880-’81 a return 
gives 30 blind pupils under 3 teachers, and the American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb 
gives 78 as the whole number of deaf-mutes at the close of 1881, with 6 teachers. The 
common English branches were taught, including drawing for the deaf-mutes, selected 
classes from whom received special instruction in articulation and lip reading, while the 
studies for the blind reached the higher branches and music. The industries were car- 
pentry, cabinet work, shoemaking, tailoring, broom and mattress making, chair caning, 
and printing. The mattress, broom, and chair shops were reserved for the blind boys, 
while the girls made all their own clothing and the underwear of the boys. The course 
of instruction covers 8 years, and in the blind department extends from the embossed 
alphabet up through all the grades of the highest academic branches, while the deaf- 
mute is confined to the study of language until he has acquired a sufficient knowledge 
of it to begin the study of the ordinary school branches.— (Biennial report and return.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of public instruction, elected by the people for two years, has 
general supervision of the common schools. Each county has a school superintendent, 
who is elected by the people for two years, and such counties as have over 15,000 popu- 
lation may have two if the board of supervisors shall so determine. District. school 
affairs are managed by district boards consisting of the director, treasurer, and clerk, 
who are elected at district meetings and hold office for 3 years, with annual change of one. 
In towns which have adopted the township district system, the schools are under boards 
of school directors composed of the clerks of the various subdistricts. Free high schools 
are in charge of boards of 3 members, comprising a director, treasurer, and clerk; but, 
in cities not under county superintendents that become high school districts, the city 
board of education acts asa high school board. State normal schools are controlled by a 
board of regents, consisting of the governor, the State superintendent, and 9 others, who 
are appointed by the governor, with the approval of the senate. Women are eligible to 
election as district, town, or county school officers. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are supported from the income of a State school fund and from local 
taxation. The latter must, in each district, equal the amount last apportioned to it 
from the State fund, the basis of such apportionment being the number of resident youth 
4to20. Each district, in order to receive its share, must sustain a common school, 
taught by a qualified teacher, for 5 months (in exceptional cases 3 months) each year, 
must have reported its school statistics according to law, and taken an annual school 
census. The law requires yearly reports to be made by district clerks, town clerks, 
county superintendents, and the State superintendent. Public schools must be non- 
sectarian and are free to all resident youth 4 to 20; pupils over 20 and non-residents 
may be admitted and instructed gratuitously or on the payment of tuition fees. Parents 
and guardians are required to send to public school at least 12 weeks in each school year 
all their children between 7 and 15 not disqualified for study, unless their education has 
been otherwise provided for; and a fine is imposed on those who violate the law. Excep- 
tion is made, however, in case the residence of a parent or guardian be situated 2 miles 
from the school-house or in case the labor of a child be necessary to the support of par- 
ent, brother, or sister. Teachers, to be legally employed, must have certificates of qual- 
ification, and they must keep a daily register or forfeit pay. Teachers’ certificates, granted 
by county superintendents on examination, are of 3 grades. State diplomas, good for 5 
years or for life, are given by a board of examiners appointed by the State superintend- 
ent. The superintendent also has power to grant diplomas to graduates of the normal 
schools (which are good for 5 years), of the State university, and-of other colleges in the 
State with equivalent courses, after they have taught successfully a certain length of 
time (which are good until annulled). 
The system comprises, besides the common schools, public, high, and State normal 
schools, teachers’ institutes, and a State university. There are also State institutions 
for the blind and deaf and a State reform school. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show an increase of over 8,000 in the number of youth of school age, 
with only 665 more enrolled in public schools and an average attendance 6,632 less than 
the preceding year. Attendance in the counties was reduced by bad weather in the 
winter, as well as by the prevalence of contagious diseases. The superintendent thinks 
the decrease would have been greater but for the compulsory law. In the cities there 
was a gain of nearly 2,000 attending public day schools and of as many more in the 
evening schools. More school districts by 41 were organized and more by 27 sent reports. 
The apparent decrease of 141 in the number of public schools taught arises from differ- 
ent methods of reporting, there being in fact an increase in some counties. In 1879-80 
each department was returned as a school, but in 1880-81 all departments ina building 
were regarded and reported as one school. Seven more high schools and 23 more graded 
schools were so reported. Fewer private schools were taught, but more pupils attended 
them ; in the cities, children were taken from these and sent to public schools. Public 
school-houses increased by 87 and the value of all public school property by $219,359. 
Fewer teachers were employed, all the reductions but one taking place among the men. 
The pay of teachers was on the whole slightly increased ; in the cities men are reported 
as receiving on an average $8.11 more and women $1.19 more a month, while in the 
counties men were paid $1.75 less and women 30 cents more. The superintendent re- 
ports a decrease in the number applying for certificates, and says teachers are seeking 
more remunerative positions in the tradesand professions opened to them by the revival 
 
-P-A-G-E-548
  
  
  270 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
in business. A larger amount of money was expended for public schools, although the 
reported receipts for them were less. There was an increase of $42,370 in the public 
school fund and of $27,793 in the normal school fund, while the university and agricult- 
ural college funds also increased somewhat. 
The superintendent finds evidence of a steady and healthful advance in all grades 
of schools and methods of school work. He reports, also, greater harmony and zeal in 
the management and teaching of the schools ; a more general recognition of the prom- 
inent defects in the public school system and more apparent willingness to remedy them ; 
a slight growth of sentiment favorable to the employment of better teachers and for 
longer terms ; a wider dissemination of information in respect to hygienic laws in their 
application to school-houses, grounds, and the care of children while in school, and a 
marked progress in methods of instruction in the country schools through the introduc- 
tion therein of a\graded system of study. This system consists of a classification of 
pupils into three grades with regular steps, promotion from one to the other being made 
according to fixed rules, and the arrangement of a simple but complete method of school 
records. Great importance is attached to the adoption of this system, and the most 
active labor has been given during the year toits introduction. As during the preceding 
year, circulars on the subject were sent to school officers and teachers ; meetings of county 
superintendents were held to discuss the best means of instructing teachers and of en- 
listing the interests of school boards in the system. The course of study for teachers’ 
institutes and the teaching given therein were based on this graded course for country 
schools ; public addresses were made explaining it and reports of its workings were pub- 
lished in educational and other journals. The result has been beyond the superintend- 
ent’s expectations, the system having been introduced into about one-fifth of the pre- 
viously ungraded schools of the State.— (State report. ) 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT. 
‘The superintendent repeats former recommendations as to changes in the school laws 
with a view to securing (1) better qualification of teachers and their greater permanence; 
(2) the provision of text books free of charge to pupils; (3) the enforcement of attendance 
on teachers’ institutes; (4) changes in the compulsory education law making the required 
12 weeks consecutive, “and providing for the appointment of officers to look after truant 
children, to prosecute parents and guardians for violation of the law, and prevent the 
unlawful employment of children. He also advises the enactment of laws defining the 
educational qualifications necessary for superintendents; making the appointment of two 
superintendents in counties having over 15,000 population compulsory instead of permis- 
sive, as now; levying an annual State tax of two mills on the dollar of taxable property 
for public schools, one-half of the proceeds to be apportioned on the basis of attendance; 
and making compulsory the introduction of the town instead of the district system of 
schools. He says the voluntary system has been %n operation 12 years, with but little 
advantage, the town system being now in use in only 19 towns in 9 counties. A few 
others adopted it, but abandoned it, chiefly because of its unlikeness in some points to 
the system prevailing in a majority of the districts. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Ten schools of this class send reports for 1880-’81, and the State superintendent’s re- 
port shows that 3 others were taught during the year. Five of them, situated in Mil- 
waukee, enrolled 246 pupils, under 13 teachers. Two are reported in La Crosse and 
Oshkosh, while Madison, Sheboygan, Watertown, Beloit, Kenosha, and Neenah each 
report 1 such school; one of those at Oshkosh was attached to the State normal school. 
A strong sentiment favorable to the introduction of this system into the public schools 
has been created by the efforts of intelligent people, particularly women, in a few of the 
larger cities, and in Milwaukee a complete and well furnished Kindergarten was estab- 
lished under the supervision of the board of education. The establishment in 1879’80 
of a Kindergarten department in connection with the normal school at Oshkosh resulted 
so favorably that in 1881 the board made similar provision for the school at Platteville. 
No report from this has yet appeared. 
For statistics of Kindergarten, see Table V of the appendix, and for a summary of 
these statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of fhe Commissioner preceding.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
All the cities given in the above table report graded courses of study covering from 8 
to 12} years. Milwaukee reports the lowest number, 8, but has beyond those 8 grades 
a high school with 4 years’ courses, and has had normal classes beyond. 
Appleton reports 7 public schools, taught in as many buildings, capable of seating 1,750 
pupils; all but one of the buildings in good condition, all but 2 built of stone or brick, 
put only 1 of them properly ventilated; another school building needed; 4 private schools, 
with 10 teachers and 396 pupils. Semimonthly teachers’ meetings were held. 
Fond du Lac reports 19 graded and 6 ungraded public schools, one of the former a high 
school; 19 school buildings, capable of seating 2,800 pupils; the buildings all in good 
condition, but only 4 properly ventilated; the 43 ‘school rooms wel] supplied with black- 
boards and 40 of them with dictionaries.’ Teachers? meetings are held semimonthly. 
The Green Bay system comprised 1 ungraded and 4 graded schools. Of the 5 school 
buildings (3 of brick or stone), only 2 were in good condition and only 1 properly ven- 
tilated. Another building was needed, the existing ones being capable of seating only 
1,000 pupils. Teachers’ meetings were held monthly. Four private schools were taught, 
with 350 pupils, under 7 teachers. 
In Janesville 6 graded schools, with 4 or more departments in each, including a high 
school, were taught in 6 buildings, capable of seating 1,801 pupils; all the buildings 
(which were of stone or brick) were in good condition and properly ventilated. The 
semimonthly teachers’ meetings were well attended... Four private schools were taught, 
having 175 pupils, under 4 teachers. Many children leave school early to work in ‘face 
tories, and the number seems likely to increase rather than diminish. 
La Crosse reports 13 graded and. 3 ungraded day schools and 1 evening school, the 
latter with 80 pupils, under 2 teachers; 10 school buildings, 5 being of stone or brick, 
and all capable of seating 2,150 pupils; 1 house built during the year, but another 
needed; all but 1 of the 10 in good condition, but only 5 properly ventilated; and 4 pri- 
vate schools, with 600 pupils and 14 teachers. Meetings of the public school teachers 
were held weekly. 
The Madison public schools were taught in 9 houses, capable of seating 3,480 pupils; 
all but 1 of the houses were of stone or brick, all in good condition and properly venti- 
lated. Teachers’ meetings were held weekly. There were 8 private schools, with 650 
pupils attending. 
Milwaukee, besides 26 graded public schools, had 13 free night schools, the latter with 
2,030 pupils enrolled, under 59 teachers. Of the 26 school buildings all but 2 were 
of brick or stone, and all but 1 were reported in good condition. One was built dur- 
ing the year, but 6 others were required to accommodate the pupils, who were steadily 
increasing in number. Music, drawing, and German were among the branches taught 
in all the grades, and improvement is noted in the instruction given in all three. Dur- 
ing the year there was much discussion in the board as to continuing German in the pub- 
lic schools, and able reports were presented on both sides, the result being a decision that 
it should be continued. The course of study below the high school extends over 8 
years, the high adding 4 more. In this school the curriculum was reorganized during 
the year and 4 distinct courses were established : English-scientific, German-English, 
preparatory normal, and Latin-English. Greek was discontinued for the present, the 
number pursuing it being thought too small to justify its continuance. Efforts made 
by the board to secure economy in school administration led to a reduction in the pay of 
teachers during the first three years of service, defended on the ground of the youth and 
inexperience of a majority of them when appointed, although it is acknowledged that 
nearly all are normal school graduates and among the best in the force. By such economy 
the board was enabled to establish evening schools as an experiment, and the earnest-

ness with which they were attended by young men and women was surprising. The 
evening schools were maintained to the end of February. During the term several hun- 
dred persons were refused admission, the funds available being insufficient. There were 
48 private schools, with 7,311 pupils, under 174 teachers. 
Oshkosh reports 7 graded and 2 ungraded public schools, taught in 10 buildings, 8 of 
which were in good condition and properly ventilated; teachers’ meetings held monthly; 
and 7 private schools, with 975 pupils. 
Racine reports 7 graded and 2 ungraded public schools, 8 school buildings, all in good 
condition and properly ventilated; one more building required; a high school, with 93 
pupils; and 8 private schools, with 954 pupils attending. Teachers’ meetings were held 
semimonthly. 
In Watertown the public schools comprised 5 graded (including 1 high) and 1 night 
school, the latter having 115 pupils enrolled. The 5 school buildings (all in good condi- 
tion and well ventilated) were capable of seating 1,200 pupils. Teacheys’ meetings were 
held semimonthly. Five private schools reported 800 pupils under 15 teachers. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
\ STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The 4 State normal schools, at Oshkosh, Platteville, River Falls, and Whitewater, re- 
port a total of 1,029 normal pupils attending during the year (381 men and 648 women) 
and 65 graduates, of whom 12 were from the advanced course. Certificates are given to 
students who complete the elementary course of 2 years, and diplomas to graduates of the 
advanced course, which requires 2 years more. Graduates of the full course, after teach- 
ing successfully for one school year, may have their diplomas countersigned by the State 
superintendent, which gives them the value of unlimited State certificates, good for life 
unless revoked for cause. In like manner graduates of the elementary course may re- 
ceive the limited State certificate, good for 5 years. The State normal schools are sus- 
tained mainly from the income of a normal school fund and offer tuition free to such as 
agree to teach in the public schools of the State. They are under the control of a board 
of regents consisting of 9 members appointed by the governor, the latter and the State 
superintendent being members ex officio. The president of the board of regents reports 
a steady increase in the amount of professional training given in these schools. He 
thinks, too, that greater skill is shown by the teachers in blending the professional and 
academic instruction. President McGregor, of the Platteville school, notes a constantly 
increasing demand for graduates and undergraduates of that school to teach, and Pres- 
ident Albee, of the Oshkosh school, makes a similar report. 
The Kindergarten established at the Oshkosh school in May, 1880, fully met the ex- 
pectations of its friends. The visitors say that the work done therein was admirable and 
think its introduction will be amply justified, even should the normal students learn 
nothing more from it than how to keep little ones busy and interested. 
An important addition was made during the year to the Platteville building by the 
erection of a two-story wing, 45 by 65 feet, substantially built at a cost of $10,000. 
A new State normal is to be established within a year or twoat Milwaukee. That city 
has appropriated $50,000 for a building and donated five city lots as a site for it. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Milwaukee Normal School, a department of the city school system, presenting a profes- 
sional coutse of 1 year for the preparation of teachers for the city schools, reports 15 
pupils during the year, of whom 13 were graduated. 
The National German-American Teachers’ Seminary, Milwaukee, gives free tuition in a 
3 years’ course of study and reports 19 normal and 12 other students during the year. 
The Catholic Normal School of the Holy Family, St. Francis Station, reports 35 normal 
students, all men, and 10 graduates, all of whom engaged in teaching. There were 2 
courses of study, of 3 and 5 years, respectively. 
Some instruction for students expecting to teach is provided -at Galesville and Law- 
rence Universities and at Milton College. Northwestern University, too, had a normal 
department in 1878, the date of the last catalogue received by this Office. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Fifty-six institutes were held by State authority, having an enrolment of 3,757, a 
decrease for the year of 8 institutes and 686 enrolled. Most of them remained in session 
2 weeks, only 16 having so short a term as 1 week. A large majority of the teachers 
attending had been trained in college, academy, normal school, or high school, only 1,079 
having had no further advantages than those of the commonschools. Besides the above, 
provided by the State, 11 private institutes were held by county and city superintend- 
ents. Seven of these lasted 1 week each; one, 2 weeks; and two. 5 to 6 weeks. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-551
    WISCONSIN. : 273 
decrease during the year in the number of institutes held by the State was owing partly 
to the private ones held and partly to the fact that the subjects discussed in the public 
institutes have been largely taken from primary school work, not specially interesting 
to teachers above that grade. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Wisconsin Journal of Education, published monthly at Madison, under the ed- 
itorship of the State superintendent and his assistant, continued to give valuable 
information on educational topics, as in preceding years. It is the organ of the State 
‘Teachers’ Association and of the State department of education, and is one of the most 
useful journals of its class. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
State aid to the amount of $500 a year for the first five years is given, on certain con- 
ditions, to high schools organized under the school law. There were 117 high schools 
taught, 7 more than in 1879-80 ; of these, 78 were aided from the fund and 39 were not. 
Thirteen new schools were organized under the law, and 20, whose five years had ex- 
pired, were transferred to the list of those receiving no aid. If the law should remain 
unchanged it was said that 36 more schools would be added to the latter class in 1882. 
The State superintendent thinks the State aid should be continued in a majority of 
cases longer than 5 years, and advises a change to that effect in the law. This he thinks 
especially desirable in the smaller villages and moredensely populated country districts, 
where the school taxes are already high. In both classes of schools there were enrolled 
8,202 pupils, under 263 teachers. There were 3,566 pupils in these schools studying 
only the common school branches ; 2,805 studied “algebra and geometry, 3,640 the nat- 
ural sciences, 1,155 modern languages, and 1,340 ancient languages. The graduates in 
1881 numbered 462, of whom 159 were boys and 303 girls ; the total number of grad- 
uates was 2,781 (960 boys and 1,821 girls). 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The State superintendent reports statistics from 17 academies and 7 business colleges,, 
having a total of 2,826 pupils, under 129 teachers. Of the pupils 1,198 belonged to the 
business colleges and 1,628 to the academies; the former sent out 24 graduates in 1880, 
the latter 53. For further statistics of such of these schools as report to this Office, 
see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix ; for pupils in preparatory departments of 
colleges, see Table IX, and for general summaries, see corresponding tables in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Reports in some form have come for 1880-81 (see Table IX) from the University of 
Wisconsin, Madison; Lawrence University, Appleton; Beloit College, Beloit; Galesville 
University, Galesville; Milton College, Milton; Racine College, Racine; Ripon College, 
Ripon, and Northwestern University, Watertown. All these institutions, except Racine 
and Beloit Colleges, were open to both sexes; all but the university at Madison present 
arrangements as before for preparatory instruction; all continued their classical courses 
of 4 years; and all but one (Beloit College) had scientific courses of equallength. This 
offered, instead of the scientific, a philosophical course of 4 years, which embraced an 
amount of Latin and Greek considered necessary to a liberal education, but gave special 
attention to science and the modern languages. German and French form a part of the 
course in 6 of these institutions. Kipon College provides only for German, which here, 
as in several of the others, forms a substitute for Greek in the scientific course. The 
State university adds instruction in the Scandinavian languages, as well as technical de- 
partments in science. Two have departments of music and 3 of drawing and painting; 
3 prepare for teaching and 3 for business. 
The State superintendent received reports from 17 institutions claiming to be collegi- 
ate. Four of these, however, are by this Office classed with academies, 2 with colleges 
for women, and 1 with commercial colleges. Al] had a total attendance of 2,687 students; 
ie students were graduated, 50 were candidates for the degree of A. B., and 34 for that 
of B.S. 
The State University discontinued its preparatory department, with the exception of a 
class in Greek, strengthened its higher courses of instruction, particularly in the depart- 
ments of practical knowledge, and increased the number of elective studies. The astro- 
nomical observatory was finished and successful work done in it; Ladies’ Hall was reor-

274 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  ganized and suitable grounds were acquired for a gymnasium. The report of the board 
of visitors shows perfect harmony of opinion in regard to the results of coeducation. 
They say that the health of the young women in the university as well as their scholar- 
ship compared well with that of the young menand very favorably with that of young 
women in general. The policy of the university in regard to discipline is also approved 
and its results commended, the aim being to develop character through reasonable per- 
sonal freedom. ‘There has been for the last 6 years a gradual change in the relative 
number of students pursuing the three leading courses, the ancient classical in 1881 num- 
bering 60 (21 more thanin 1875), the modern classical 71 (45 more), and the scientific 76 
(44 less). This change is ascribed partly to an advance in the admission to the scientific 
course, partly to the preference of young women for the modern classical course, and 
partly to the fact that the feeling in favor of a scientific as opposed to a classical educa- 
tion seems to be somewhat abated. Special students are becoming each year a more im- 
portant element; few of them belong to the class of those who are unable to take the 
regular work; many who lack time or means for the full course, including often graduates 
of normal schools, remain one, two, ormore years. Some, however, who wish to lighten 
the examinations engage for a time in special studies and then find their way into the 
regular classes. 
For further statistics of the colleges and universities, see Table IX of the appendix, 
and for a summary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preced- 
ing.    
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
Besides the 6 foregoing institutions, open to both sexes, there are 4 especially for 
young women: the Wisconsin Female College and Fox Lake Seminary, Fox Lake (Con- 
gregational); Milwaukee College, Milwaukee (non-sectarian); Santa Clara Academy, 
Sinsinawa Mound (Roman Catholic), and Kemper Hall, Kenosha (Protestant Episcopal). 
The first three named report a total of 94 students in collegiate classes (4 of them being 
young men), 215 in preparatory departments, and 95 in special courses. Only 1, the Mil- 
waukee College, reports itself as authorized to confer collegiate degrees. Anacademy for 
young men was organized in connection with the Wisconsin Female College in 1875, the 
young men entering the collegiate department if they wish and reciting in the same 
classes with the young women; the boarding hall is reserved for the young women exclu- 
sively. Latin, German, music, painting, and drawing are taught in this college; that at 
Milwaukee adds French to the above; at Santa Clara Academy the course comprises 
French, German, Italian, music, crayon, oil, and water color. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
As already stated, nearly all the colleges and universities present courses of instruction 
in general sciences. The State University makes provision for scientific and technical 
instruction in a general scientific course of 4 years, a department of agriculture, one of 
civil and mechanical engineering, and one of mining engineering and metallurgy, each 
course occupying 4 years. Applicants for admission to the agricultural and general scien- 
tific courses must pass an examination in natural philosophy, physiology, botany, and a 
certain amount of German or Latin, as well as in English grammar and analysis. After 
1882 solid geometry will also be required. Students desiring to enter the engineering or 
mining department must be fitted for the sophomore year in the general science course. 
In agriculture prominence is given to such studies as chemistry, botany, and zodlogy. 
A term must be spent in the machine shop learning the use of tools, and two terms are 
given to practical work in horticulture. The study of agriculture does not involve 
manual labor on the farm; where such work is undertaken by students they are paid 
for it. Students who may not wish to take the full course in agriculture may take a 2 
years’ course or they are received as special students. The regents of the university re- 
port marked progress in this department, as well as in those of civil and mechanical en- 
gineering, mining, metallurgy, and mechanics; and the committee of citizens appointed 
by law to visit the university express the opinion that opportunities are afforded here 
for the training of young men as engineers, miners, chemists, geologists, farmers, and 
draughtsmen which are equal to those of the best special schools. 
For statistics, see Table X of the appendix, and a corresponding table in the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction is given in the Seminary of St. Francis of Sales, St. Francis 
Station (Roman/Catholic), which reports 203 students and 34 graduates; in Nashotah 
House, Nashotah Mission, Waukesha County (Protestant Episcopal), which had 12 stu- 
dents and graduated 3; in the Mission House, Franklin (Reformed Church), with 11
-P-A-G-E-553
  WISCONSIN. 275 
students; and in the Lutheran Seminary, Madison, which is sustained by the synod of 
the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. This institution reports 13 
theological students, all of whom had received a degree in letters or science. In the 
seminary at St. Francis Station the course extends over 10 years, pupils as young as 13 
being admitted. They must be able to read and write English or German and must 
intend to become priests. Those admitted to the Nashotah House must also be candi- 
dates for priests’ orders. All received in the theological department of the Lutheran 
Seminary are college graduates. No examination is required for admission to the Re- 
formed Church school at Franklin. 
These 4 schools reported to the State superintendent a total of 284 pupils (of whom 
176 were in regular theological classes and 108 in preparatory), 48 graduates during the 
year, and 590 graduates in all. 
For further statistics, see Table XI of the appendix, and for a summary, see a corre- 
sponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
The daw department of the University of Wisconsin reports 52 students for 1880-81, 
of whom 9 had received a degree in letters or science, and 34 graduates. This depart- 
ment has recently gained importance in the work of the university. The attendance 
fell off slightly during the year, through changes respecting admission and graduation; 
but, as the school is now organized, its diploma has much greater value. Candidates 
for admission must pass an examination in English branches, and if under 20 they must 
be college graduates. In order to graduate, two whole years must be given to the study 
of law, one of them under the faculty of this school, and a final examination conducted 
by the faculty before the annual board of visitors must be passed. The law library, the 
largest of its kind in the Northwest, is at all times accessible to the students and receives 
important additions each year. 
For statistics, see Table XII of the appendix, and for a summary, see a corresponding 
table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
No medical schools are reported. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Wisconsin Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Delavan, reports 179 pupils, organ- 
ized in 10 regular classes under as many teachers; also, supplemental classes in articula- 
tion, to which special attention is given. Primary, intermediate, and academic branches 
are taught; also, such employments as shoemaking, cabinet work, and printing. An. 
effort was made to secure a teacher in drawing, but funds proved insufficient. The 
State provides board and tuition free of charge for all deaf and dumb residents of Wis- 
consin between the ages of 10 and 25 who are of suitable capacity. 
Provision is also made for the instruction of deaf-mutes in St. John’s Catholic Deaf-Mute 
Institute, St. Franeis, and in the Wisconsin Phonological Institute, Milwaukee. St. John’s 
had 43 pupils during the year, who were taught religious doctrine, the common school 
branches, printing, shoemaking, agriculture, general housework, needlework, and fancy 
work. The Phonological Institute reports 21 pupils, who were instructed in the com- 
mon English branches, gymnastics, drawing, and needlework. The articulation method 
is the only one used in this school, which is in charge of a board of visitors appointed. 
by the Wisconsin Phonological Institute, a society organized in 1879 for the purpose of 
propagating the method of instruction by articulation. The funds of the society are 
sufficient to sustain only a limited number of indigent pupils, who are admitted with- 
out charge. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Wisconsin Institution for the Education of the Blind, Janesville, embraces in ‘its 
course of study and training the common and highschool branches, music (vocal and instru- 
mental), and such employments as carpet weaving, cane seating, sewing, knitting, cro- 
cheting, and bead work. Each pupil is expected to spend an hour every day in some 
industrial occupation. During the year there were 83 pupils under instruction, and 
since the organization of the institution in 1850 there have been 299. No charge is made 
for board or tuition. The age for admission is from 8 to 21, and pupils may remain as 
Jong as is necessary to finish the course of study. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Wisconsin Industrial School for Boys, Waukesha, reports 90 boys 10 to 16 years old 
committed to its care during the year, with 5 returned to it, the whole number attend- 
ing being 525. They were divided into two classes, which alternately work and attend 
the school, where they are taught the common English branches. The school is divided 
into 5 departments, each with 3 classes, and promotions are made from the lower to the
-P-A-G-E-554
276 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
higher after a written examination. The employments provided are the manufacture 
of shoes, socks, and mittens. 
The Wisconsin Industrial School for Girls, Milwaukee, receives girls from infancy to 16, 
the conditions of commitment being destitution, vagrancy, or danger of becoming de- | 
praved. All remain in school 4 hours daily, and the younger ones 6 hours. They are 
taught the common school branches, history, domestic economy and science, besides 
housework, hand and machine sewing, cutting, and many kinds of fancy work. Seventy- 
tive per cent. of those discharged are known to have become orderly and useful mem- 
bers of society. 
The Good Shepherd Industrial School (for girls), Milwaukee, under the care of the Roman 
Catholic Church, is partly sustained by the county. Plain and fancy sewing and knit- 
ting, washing, ironing, and all domestic employments are taught; also, reading, writing, 
spelling, and arithmetic. 
Four orphan asylums, 3 of them in Milwaukee, admitting only girls, and 1 at La 
Crosse, for boys, report an aggregate of nearly 300 children. Three are supported by the 
Roman Catholic Church; the other, which is not denominational, by the contributions 
of friends, The children are instructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, and housework, 
and when old enough to be useful are provided with homes. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
WISCONSIN STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-ninth annual meeting of this association was held at AppletonYuly 6-8, 
1881, President I. N. Stewart in the chair. 
After the usual introductory exercises, Prof. F. H. King delivered a lecture on ‘‘The 
modern doctrine of evolution,’’ accompanied by illustrations. On the following day an 
address of welcome was delivered by Mayor Humphrey Pierce, which was responded to 
by Ex-President W. H. Beach. President Stewart then delivered the annual address. 
This was referred to committees for consideration of and report on various topics em- 
braced, such as ‘‘State certificates,” ‘sanitation of school buildings,” ‘‘ normal schools 
and institute work,’’ and ‘‘colleges and universities.’? President G. S. Albee, chair- 
man of the committee on a course of reading for teachers, submitted a report, present- 
ing a course for 4 years, which embraced, besides professional works, choice selections 
from history, fiction, belles lettres, and science. A paper on ‘‘ Examinations in school, 
their methods and functions,” prepared by Principal M. S. Frawley, was read by Super- 
intendent Neill and discussed by President Stewart. Dr. Peet, of the Wisconsin Acad- 
emy of Arts and Sciences, spoke of certain investigations concerning the Wisconsin 
mounds, and asked the aid of teachers in the resurvey of these mounds. Miss Etta S. 
Carle read a paper on ‘‘Naples and its surroundings,’’ and Miss Mary A. Wadsworth, one 
on ‘‘Thackeray.’? After the election of officers for the ensuing year, the committee 
that had under consideration the subject of State certificates presented a report, adopted 
after some discussion, expressing a belief that the present laws on the subject give gen- 
eral satisfaction and recommending that no action in the matter be taken. A paper was 
read by Principal J. M. Rait on ‘‘ Ungraded and backward pupils : what shall we do with 
them?”’ and one relating to sanitary matters connected with school work, by Dr. Chit- 
tenden, of the State board of health. E. G. Haylett read apaper on drawing, illustrat- 
ing it by use of the blackboard, and Prof. N. M. Wheeler, one on ‘‘ The machine in edu- 
cation.”? An abstract of a paper on “‘The practical in education,’ by President Albee, 
was read, and after the adoption of resolutions and some other business the association 
adjourned. * 
MEETING OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The semiannual meeting of county superintendents usually held in connection with 
the State association took place on Thursday afternoon, July 7, the addresses and papers 
comprising ‘‘ Examinations in theory and art of teaching,’’ ‘‘ Township system of school 
government,’’ ‘‘ Uses and abuses of the county superintendency,”’ ‘‘Is a uniformity of 
teachers’ examinations throughout the State desirable?” and “‘ Difficulties in grading 
country schools.’? There were present 18 county and 5 city superintendents, besides State 
Superintendent Whitford (who presided) and his assistant, 8. S. Rockwood. 
MEETING OF INSTITUTE CONDUCTORS. 
The annual meeting of institute conductors was held at Appleton July 5, 1881, State 
Superintendent W. C. Whitford presiding. The best methods of teaching the various 
common school branches were presented and discussed, Prof. R. Graham presenting the 
subject of reading, Prof. A. J. Hutton arithmetic, Prof. J. B. Thayer writing, and Prof. 
A. Salisbury language. Prof. A. F. North read a paper showing how exercises in local 
history may be profitably given, and Mr. Chandler and others discussed the question of

examination in connection with the institutes. In the evening State Superintendent 
Whitford read a paper on ‘‘ Future work in the gradation of country schools; ’’? Superin- 
tendent James T. Lunn read one entitled ‘‘ Lessons learned in introducing the graded 
system into country schools,’ and several other superintendents gave their experience and 
views on the subject. On the following day Prof. A. J. Hutton presented ‘‘Drawing;’’ 
Prof. J. B. Thayer, ‘‘ Geography,” Prof. A. Salisbury, ‘‘ United States history and gov- 
ernment;’’ Prof. A. A. Miller, ‘‘Good behavior;’’ and Professor Graham, the ‘‘ Theory 
and art of teaching.”’

Nearly all the information at hand as to schools in Alaska for 1880-’81 relates to those 
sustained by the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions, which has schools at Sitka, Fort 
Wrangell, and among the Chilkat tribe of Indians, employing 11 missionary teachers in 
this field. 
At Sitka the school attendance increased considetably during the year, the average 
being 230 pupils. This increase is ascribed to a compulsory attendance Jaw proclaimed 
and enforced by Captain Glass, in command of the United States ship Jamestown. A 
much needed training school or boarding school for boys was opened at Sitka in Novem- 
ber, 1881, and in December it numbered 25 pupils. Its beginning was made by a few 
boys who complained that they could not study while living at home, on account of the 
quarrelling and carousing there, and obtained permission to sleep in the school-house. 
They brought their own blankets and picked up food as they could. Others joined them, 
and as the number increased an old hospital building was fitted up for their use and a 
teacher moved into it with them. 
The boarding and day school at Fort Wrangell made steady progress, from 90 to 100 
pupils attending during the winter terms. A school among the Chilkats, established in 
1880 and at first taught only by a native, had 60 to 80 pupils, who were learning words of 
3 letters and improving rapidly, being very desirous to advance. At the Chilkat station, 
which has been named Haines, a substantial two story frame building was erected as a 
residence for the teachers, and another building purchased and refitted for the school. 
Besides these schools two others were opened during the summer among two large and 
powerful tribes not previously provided for, the Hydah and Hoonyah. 
As the superintendent of this work (Dr. Sheldon Jackson) remarks, the difficulties of 
providing suitable buildings for teachers and schools in a region hundreds of miles from 
a saw mill and 1,500 to 2,000 miles from stores of supply can be little appreciated in the 
older sections of the country. The lumber, hardware, glass, and carpenters for the Chil- 
kat school at Haines were brought from San Francisco, Cal., and Portland, Oreg. The 
monthly mail steamer landed them, with teachers and superintendent, 100 miles from 
their destination, which was reached after considerable delay. Upon completion of the 
building here, men and materials were transported through the aid of Captain Glass, of 
the steamship Jamestown, to the principal village of the Hoonyah tribe, at the head of 
Lynn Channel, where a similar building was erected at Boyd; and a canoe voyage along 
the coast for about 500 miles brought them to the southern end of Prince of Wales Island, 
among the Hydah tribe, where a large native plank house was used, it having been found 
impossible to convey any lumber there. 
OTHER SCHOOLS. 
No recent information has come from the two schools of the Alaska Commercial Company 
on the Seal Islands, nor from the Russian schools at Unalashka and Belkovsky. These, 
with the missionary schools above noted, it is believed, comprise all that have been yet 
established in Alaska, leaving a population of fully 20,000 without any educational ad- 
vantages whatever.— (Presbyterian Home Missions and report from Rey. Sheldon Jack- 
son, superintendent. )

tion, for the two years indicated.) 
TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A territorial superintendent of public instruction is elected by the people every 2 
years and is associated with the governor and treasurer in a territorial board of educa- 
tion. The territorial board has general charge of the school system, and determines, 
among other things, the text books to be used and the terms on which teachers’ diplo- 
mas are to be granted. The probate judge in each county isex officio superintendent of 
the county public schools. For the examination of persons proposing to teach in these, 
the territorial superintendent appoints 2 persons to act with the judge as a county board. 
of examiners and grant certificates to such as are found qualified. Three school trustees 
are elected by the people in each school district; in case of failure to elect, they are ap- 
pointed by the county superintendent, subject to the approval of the territorial superin- 
tendent.— (Laws of 1679), 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are supported from a territorial tax of 15 cents on each $100, appor- 
tioned to the counties according to the youth between the ages of 6 and 21, as ascertained 
by a biennial census; from a county tax of 50 to 80 cents, apportioned among the sey- 
eral districts within the county where raised, in proportion to the number that have

280 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
attended the public schools in said districts during the three months previous; and from a 
district tax voted by the residents of districts, should the territorial and county funds prove 
insufficient to maantain the schools 3 months. The board of education on examination 
issues certificates of 2 grades to professional teachers of experience and ability, one for 
life, another for 6 years. Teachers not holding ‘such certificates must pass an examina- 
tion by the county board of examiners, who may issue certificates good for 2 years. In 
order to receive any portion of the public school funds, schools must be taught by teachers 
duly examined and legally employed, and no sectarian doctrines must be introduced; 
school districts must also report according to law. ‘Children between 8 and 14, unless 
taught regularly at home or in private schools or exempted on account of disability, 
must attend school for 16 weeks each year. This compulsory law, however, has not 
been enforced, owing to the lack of school accommodations. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
i 
The territorial superintendent expresses the conviction that a deep interest was taken 
in education by the people of the Territory during the year, and that a flourishing con- 
dition of the publicschools exists, though the meagre statistics furnished by school officers 
failed to present this in any fair degree. For a time, however, he thinks the best results 
cannot be generally reached because of sparsely settled rural districts, short school terms, 
and small but costly schools. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
TUCSON. 
Tucson expended $4,527 for teachers’ salaries in 1881 and $2,519 for other schoo] pur- 
poses. The report of the principal of the public school states that the schools have been 
graded during the year into 3 divisions: primary, with 4 grades; grammar, with 4; and 
high, with scientific and literary courses of 3 years. The attendance in the primary 
and grammar grades was 234; that in the high school, if any had reached that grade, 
was not given. The school population was estimated at 1,500, the attendance in Roman 
Catholic schools at 450, leaving about 800 not attending any school. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
\ PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
There are two schools of this grade known to exist, one at Prescott and one opened or | 
prepared to open in 1881 at Tucson. A third is indicated by the United States census 
of 1880, probably at Phoenix, as Superintendent Sherman speaks of high school work 
being done there. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
TERRITORIAL UNIVERSITY. 
The law provides for the establishment of a university, to be under the control of a 
board of regents composed of the governor, the judges of the supreme court, and three 
resident property holders of the Territory. It is to be supported by the proceeds of the 
university lands granted by the United States, by individual gifts, and by territorial 
appropriation, but has not yet been commenced, as the funds are insufficient.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
  OFFICERS. 
A superintendent of public instruction is appointed by the governor, with the approval 
of the legislative assembly, for a term of 2 years. County superintendents, who may 
be either men or women, are elected by the people for 2 years. District boards, com- 
prising a director, clerk, and treasurer, are elected for 3 years, 1 going out each year. 
No distinction of sex is made in the qualification of voters in district meetings. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are supported from a county tax of 2 mills on the dollar, a poll tax of 
$1 on each elector, the proceeds of fines and forfeitures, and such special district taxes 
as may be voted by the people, the last, however, not to exceed 1 per cent. on the tax- 
able property for school-houses and sites, 1} per cent. for teachers’ wages, fuel, and other 
contingent expenses, } of 1 per cent. for school furniture and apparatus, and $25 annu* 
ally for each district library. County funds are apportioned to each district in propor- 
tion to the number of resident children and youth therein 5 to 21, and the public schools 
are free to all of that age. No district is entitled to its share of the fund unless it has 
sustained a school 3 months during the previous year and forwarded a report of school 
statistics to the county superintendent. Destitute children 8 to 14 are provided with 
necessary books, The Bible must not he excluded from the public schools; it may be

  282 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
read 10 minutes daily, but without sectarian comment, and no pupil is required to read 
it contrary to the wishes of parent or guardian. Teachers must make reports of school 
statistics each term or forfeit pay; county superintendents must report annually to the 
territorial superintendent on penalty of like forfeiture, and the territorial superintend- 
ent must report annually to the governor. A territorial teachers’ institute, lasting 
from 3 to 6 days, must be held each year at some convenient point by the territorial su- 
perintendent, if so requested in writing by one or more county superintendents; and if 
such request be not made he is required to hold institutes in three judicial districts, to 
continue not less than 6 nor more than 12 days. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The public school statistics of this Territory for 1880~’81 are very meagre, owing to the 
fact that several of the larger counties failed to send any report to the territorial super- 
intendent. Among the causes suggested for this failure are defective laws and the small 
pay of county superintendents, who receive only $3 a day for time actually employed 
and 5 cents a mile for travelling expenses, nothing being allowed for stationery, &c. 
Then, too, the reports when received must be far from adequate, since they only em- 
brace statistics of the common district schools (generally ungraded), the larger cities 
and towns being managed by boards of education under special laws and not being 
required to report to the county superintendent. 
The legislature failed to authorize the publication of the territorial superintendent’s 
report for 1880-’81, but a brief one was printed by him at his own expense.! The 
superintendent’s pamphlet was addressed especially to school officers and was intended to 
aid them in a better and more uniform enforcement of the laws, besides offering sugges- 
tions as to needed amendments, the principal change recommended being the adoption 
of the township system. This is described, the advantages of its application to the Terri- 
tory are shown, and school officers are urged to use their influence in securing its adop- 
tion by the legislature. The same topicis treated by the governor in his report for 1881 to 
the Secretary of the Interior. The governor advocates the enactment of a United States 
law, applicable to all the Territories, establishing the township system; also, making pro- 
vision for the collection of statistics, the keeping of public accounts, the maintaining of 
one or more normal schools in each Territory, and the organization of the university 
already provided for. 
As in former years, the statistics are very imperfect and furnish little basis for com- 
parison. Out of 49 organized counties, from 46 of which reports were due, only 33 made 
any whatever, and nearly all were accompanied by letters showing that they are not full 
and accurate. The financial statements are particularly deficient, partly because the local 
officers neglect their accounts and reports, but largely because the law is very imperfect 
and inharmonious in respect to these matters. The superintendent thinks that less than 
two-thirds of the school revenues appear in this report; that a full one would have made 
the receipts and expenditures each over $500,000. He thinks, too, that there were at 
least 1,800 organized districts, 1,700 schools, and 1,300 school-houses valued at $1,000,000, 
with nearly 50,000 children to be provided for. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
In the cities of Yankton, Fargo, Deadwood, Grand Forks, Vermillion, and Sioux 
Falls the schools are managed by boards of education established under the special laws 
chartering them. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The boards of education in the cities above named have large powers granted them, 
including power to levy taxes, borrow money, and issue bonds. The schools of Yank- 
ton have been longest in operation and have maintained a high grade of efficiency, while 
excellent work and good progress have also been secured in the other places named. 
The great error in the plan is the localization of all their experience and the entire lack 
of cooperation, even statistics not being furnished, except as locally published. 
Yankton reports a slight decrease during the year, according to school censuses, in the 
population of the city, in the school population, and in public school enrolment, the last: 
including 749 pupils in primary, grammar, and high grades; anaverage attendance of 479 
pupils, under 14 teachers; and 10 public schools, taught in as thany buildings, all but 2 of 
the latter owned by the board, having sittings for 569 pupils. The attendance fell off 
through fears of an epidemic and was partly absorbed by a newly established Catholic 
es school. Complaint is made of carelessness on the part of some parents as to 
“I’Phe inadequacy of the superintendent's salary and other allowances has since heen remedied.
-P-A-G-E-561
    
DAKOTA. 283 
the regular attendance of pupils. Still, with all these hindrances, better work was done 
by the regular attendants than during any previous year. No study out of school is re- 
quired in any grades below the third grammar, and even in this and in the high school 
one hour a day of extra study is sufficient if the time in school be faithfully used. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
TERRITORIAL NORMAL SCHOOL. 
A territorial normal school was organized October 15, 1881, at Springfield. Aid to the 
amount of $800 was received from the city; the annual charge for tuition is $15. Cer- 
tificates are given graduates of the course (covering 3 years) which authorize holders to 
teach in the common schools without further examination.— (Return. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
As already stated, the territorial superintendent is required to hold institutes, either 
a general one at some central point or else several in the judicial districts; but no public 
funds are allowed for the expenses of these meetings. ‘Teachers are required to attend; 
and county superintendents may refuse to grant teachers’ certificates to such as are absent: 
without good excuse. Several institutes were held during 1880-81 by the superintend- 
ent, among other places at Fargo, Jamestown, Elk Point, Swan Lake, Madison, Sioux 
Falls, Mitchell, and Marion Junction. County teachers’ associations were also formed 
in several counties and attended by the superintendent, the sessions in some of them 
extending through two or three days and the work being of the character of that done 
at institutes. Other institutes were held in various counties by the county superin- 
tendents, and many brief but valuable meetings were held by teachers.— (Letter from 
superintendent. ) 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. 
No definite information for 1880-’81 has come from any public high school, except 
that at Yankton, although it is known that such exist in a number of the larger cities 
and towns of the Territory. That at Yankton reports 49 pupils and 4 graduates. The 
smallness of this class is explained by the fact that a year was added to the course of 
study, which would have left the school without any graduates in 1881 but that a few 
belonging to the senior year were able to complete the full course of 4 years in 3. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The provision heretofore made for advanced education in public high and graded 
schools is being supplemented by the establishment of academies, collegiate institutes, 
and colleges. Among these are the Academy of the Sacred Heart, Yankton (Roman 
Catholic), under the management of the Sisters, of Mercy; a collegiate institute, Sioux 
Falls (Baptist), and the Dakota College, Spearfish, in the Black Hills, established by 
Congregationalists and having the equipment and aims of a high school or academy. 
The Academy of the Sacred Heart has buildings valued at $50,000. It has been suc- 
cessful from the beginning, and its patronage steadily increases. The Roman Catholic 
Church has also maintained schools at Bismarck, Deadwood, Holy Cross, and perhaps 
other places, all having a partially academic character. 
For statistics of such as report, see Table VI of the appendix, and for a summary, see 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
TERRITORIAL UNIVERSITY. 
The University of Dakota was by an early statute located at Vermillion; and a letter 
from the territorial superintendent says local enterprise was engaged in erecting build- 
ings to cost $10,000. 
DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGES. 
The Association of Congregational Churches for Southern Dakota having established 
a college at Yankton, the citizens: gave $15,000 in money, besides grounds and other 
aids. A large and attractive building was in course of erection in the northern part of 
the city, the college having, meantime, been opened in leased apartments. 
The Presbyterians of Northern Dakota and Minnesota organized a college at Cassel- 
ton, Dakota, for which ample grounds were provided and a building was soon to be com- 
menced, the numbers and wealth of its patrons promising a vigorous progress,— (Letter 
from territorial superintendent. )

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Dakota School for Deaf-Mutes, Sioux Falls, opened by private enterprise in No- 
vember, 1880, became a territorial institution in March, 1881. The citizens of Sioux 
Falls, besides contributing liberally towards the school while it was a private one, gave 
10 acres of Jand when the Territory took charge of it, the legislature having appropri- 
ated $2,000 to erect buildings. The school is free to deaf-mutes of Dakota. Only 5 
were under instruction during the first year. 
Besides the above there were 2 pupils from this Territory attending the Iowa Institu- 
tion for the Deaf and Dumb, Council Bluffs, at a cost to the Territory of $15 a month 
for each. 
Provision for the blind was made at the Iowa College for the Blind, Vinton, which 
had 3 Dakota pupils under instruction during 1880-’81.

DISTRICT SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The chief executive officer in 1880~’81, as previously, was a superintendent of public 
schools for whites in Washington and Georgetown and for both races in the rural dis- 
tricts, with another for the public colored schools in the two cities, both appointed by 
the District Commissioners to serve during good behavior or the pleasure of the ruling 
powers. To afford aid to the trustees in the selection of qualified teachers to be em- 
ployed or promoted, a board of examiners is annually formed of the 2 superintendents, 
with others from the supervising principals and principals of individual schools chosen 
by the committee on teachers. The school board annually appoint’ supervising princi- 
pals, who act as local supervisors in their respective divisions, under the direction of the 
superintendent. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all resident children 6 to17 years of age, and by a law of 
1864 those 8 to 14 are required to attend at least 12 weeks each year, unless in other
-P-A-G-E-564
  286 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
schools or excused for cause. The want of school room has rendered this law inopera- 
tive, but as school buildings are increased it may come to'be enforced. ‘The white and 
colored pupils continued to be taught, with equal advantages, in separate schools, each 
being under teachers of the race to which they belonged; the fund is distributed to the 
schools in proportion to the school population of each race, each race having a high and 
anormal school. The city schools were of 8 grades, with high school classes rising grad- 
ually beyond these; the studies of each grade, including vocal music and industrial 
drawing, covered ayear. In the rural districts there were graded and ungraded schools, 
according to the local density of the population. The school board decides what text 
books shall be used and appoints the teachers, determining their grade from reports of 
the examining board. Teachers must attend all meetings and special classes organized 
for their improvement, and must make such daily records and present such reports as 
are required, in order to receive their pay. Both teachers and pupils are required to 
protect themselves from small pox by vaccination or otherwise. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The school record of the District for 1880-81 was such as no combination of city and 
country need be ashamed of, the public schools enrolling almost 63 per cent. of the 
43,537 children of school age. Adding the 5,000 reported as in private or church schools, 
about 32,300 of the school population, or over 74 per cent., were under instruction. The 
average daily attendance in the public schools was more than 47 per cent. of the whole 
number of school age and almost 76 per cent. of the number enrolled. There was an 
increase over the previous year of 860 in enrolment and of 93 in average daily attend- 
ance; 2 new school buildings were added during the year, with 24 rooms for study, 207 
sittings, and 27 teachers; while the school term was shortened by 3 days. There was 
but a slight variation in the average monthly pay of teachers, that of males being 97 
cents more, while that of females was less by the same amount. School property in- 
creased in value $120,533; while receipts for schools, increased by $78,687, were more 
than covered by an increased expenditure of $88,745. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
During the year 1880, the Georgetown Kindergarten (1878) was discontinued, but was 
resumed in 1881, and a new school was opened in Washington by Miss Ogla Hesselback. 
The others reporting were Capitol Hill Institute and Kindergarten (1877), Iowa Cir- 
cle Graded School and Kindergarten (1879), National Kindergarten (1874), Industrial 
(sre) Kindergarten School, Georgetown (1880), and Frébel Institute and Kindergarten 
1875). t 
For further information respecting schools of this kind, see Table V of the appendix. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Normal instruction was givén in the Washington Normal School for Whites (1873) 
and in the Miner Normal School for Colored (1877) in courses of 1 year; in the normal 
departments of Howard University (1867) and of Wayland Seminary (1865), in courses 
of 3 years each; while the Kindergarten Normal Institute (1875) reported courses of 1 
or 2 years, with different diplomas. The Washington Normal School graduated a class 
of 20, who were immediately taken up as teachers. Miner School graduated a class of 
18, and all but 1 engaged in teaching. The normal department of Howard University 
had 97 normal students, of whom 87 were in model classes. Wayland reported 103, of 
whom 39 were also in the theological department ; while the Kindergarten Institute 
graduated a class of 9, all engaging at once in teaching. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
There is no change in respect to these since 1880. The law for semiannual institutes 
still existing, the practice is to hold more frequent meetings, called teachers’ associations, 
for discussion of school questions. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The Washington high school for whites, having been retarded in its progress from its 
beginning by lack of suitable accommodations, closed the year 1880-’81 with the pros- 
pect of a new and commodious building in which to do its work in the future. In its 
3 courses—academic and scientific of 3 years each and business course of 2 years— 
there was in 1880-81 no change of studies from those of 1879-’80. In the boys’ de- 
partment there were 104 enrolled and 84 in average daily attendance and in that for

girls 130 enrolled and 100 in average daily attendance, giving an aggregate of 234 enrolled 
and of 184 ordinarily present, a gain of 55 in enrolment and of 34 in attendance over the 
previous year. For the first time in the history of this school, there was, in June, a 
ceremony of graduation, when certificates were conferred on 23 males and 33 females. 
The high school for colored continued its 3 years’ course of studies, including algebra, 
language, history, geometry, chemistry, astronomy, and mental philosophy. During 
1880-’81 the school enrolled 75, retained 60 in average daily attendance, and graduated 
12. Theaverage per cent. in scholarship for the first year was 59.4; for the second year, 
78.6; for the third year, 70.5; for entire course, 66.5 per cent., a falling off of .5 from 
last year.— (From information furnished by superintendents. )

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Georgetown College (Roman Catholic), founded as a college in 1789, chartered as a uni- 
versity in 1815, reported in 1880-81 its usual course of studies. After 2 rudimentary 
years come 2 preparatory and 4 classical collegiate, with a post graduate course, while 
there is a scientific course of comparatively low grade, covering 3 years, for which there 
is a brief English preparatory course. In the preparatory department were 147 students, 
with 3 instructors ; in the classical and scientific, 80, under 19 instructors, with 11 grad- 
uate students. The college library contained 30,000 volumes, and the college property 
was valued at $325,000.— (Catalogue and return. ) 
Gonzaga College (Roman Catholic), Washington, reopened in 1848 and incorporated as 
a university in 1858, continued, in 1880-’81, to offer its college course, including Greek 
and Latin, with a non-classical course embracing the English language and literature, 
mathematics, and natural sciences ; but no students appear to have then passed beyond a 
fair grade of preparatory studies.— (Catalogue. 
Howard University (non-sectarian) continued in 1880-81 its preparatory and normal 
courses of 3 years each, classical of 4, and a literary course of 5 years, which last embraces 
the studies of the preparatory and college courses, except the Greek of the former and the 
Latin and Greek of the latter. Counting those pursuing this course, there were 35 stu- 
dents, 16 of whom were classical and 19 preparatory. There was a library of 7,000 vol- 
umes; property valued at $250,000; a productive fund of $20,000, affording for the year 
an income of $1,957; a congressional appropriation of $10, 000, and a donation of $25,000 
from Mrs. Valeria G. Stone, of Massachusetts. — (Catalogue : and return. ) 
The National Deaf-Mute College became a.department of the Columbia Institution for the 
Deaf and Dumb in 1864, with a preparatory course of 1 year and a collegiate one of 4, 
conferring degrees of B. a M. A., B. S., B. L., and PH. B. on completion of the required 
courses. In this department there were 68 students, and in the preparatory 46, with 10 
instructors for both. Since its foundation 234 had received instruction, of whom 32 were 
teaching.— (Catalogue, report, and return.) 
Columbian University (1821) divides the studies of the college into 7 schools: English, 
Greek, Latin, and mathematics, of 4 years each; modern languages and natural science, 
of 3 years each; and a school of philosophy of 2 years. During 1880—’81 there were 
80 preparatory students, with 2 instructors, and 39 in the college department, with 10 
instructors. The degrees of A. M. and A. B. were conferred on 2 graduates. ‘There was 
a library of 7,000 volumes; college property was valued at $300,000; and there was a 
productive fund of $100,000.— (Report and return. ) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
With the exception of Howard University, which gives equal privileges to both sexes, 
there are no public institutions of collegiate rank exclusively for women in the District. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Georgetown University and Columbian University reported, as heretofore, scientific courses 
of 3 years each; the National Deaf-Mute College, one of 3 years. The polytechnic depart- 
ment of the National University, mentioned in the report of 1879-’80 as about to be 
established, had not in 1880—’81 been organized, and did not seem likely to be for some 
time to come,— (Catalogues. )

PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—The theological department of Howard University (non-sectarian) con- 
tinued in 1880-81 its examination of uncertificated applicants for admission to its 3 years’ 
course, in which it had, under 4 instructors, 39 students, of whom 6 were graduated. 
Its students have access to the university library. Wayland Seminary (Baptist) reported 
also 39 students under 1 instructor, without note of graduations. It had a library of 
1,906 volumes.— (Returns. ) 
Legal.—The law departments of Columbian University, Georgetown University, How- 
ard University, and National University had, in 1880-’81, their previous courses of 2 years 
each, followed by a1 year’s post graduate course, the supreme court of the Districtof Colum- 
bia requiring 3 years of study for admission to the bar. Georgetown reported 38students, 
including7 post graduates; Howard, 13, conferring the degree of LL. B. on its 5 graduates; 
Columbian, 155; while the National graduated 30.— (Catalogues and announcements. ) 
Medical.—The National Medical College of the Columbian University, the medical 
department of Howard University, and the medical department of the University of 
Georgetown all continued their 3 years’ graded courses, the last named extending its 
year to 8 months, the others retaining their 5 months’ courses, Howard alone requiring a 
preliminary examination in English. Columbian, from a class of 44, graduated 5, 
Georgetown the same number from a class of 41, and Howard, having 81 students, grad- 
uated 12.— (Catalogues and return.) 
The National College of Pharmacy continued in 1880-’81 to require for graduation and 
degree an age not less than 21 years, 4 years’ experience in the practice of pharmacy, 2 
full courses of lectures of 5 months each, and a 10 weeks’ course in practical and ana- 
lytical chemistry. The last course, as also that of analytical chemistry, must be taken 
in this college. Upon those who pass a satisfactory examination and are recommended 
by the an of examiners and faculty, the degree of doctor of pharmacy is conferred.—

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, on Kendall Green, near Washington 
(1857), including the collegiate department (called the National Deaf-Mute College), re- 
ported 114 students for 1880-81, of whom 103 were males and 11 females. Of these 68 
were in the college and 46 in the primary department. No change is noted, except that 
the lower preparatory class of the college ‘was removed to the primary department and 
made the advanced class of that department, leaving only the advanced preparatory be- 
low the freshmen, now called the introductory class. No mention is made of the results 
of teaching articulation, reported in 1879-80 as being very encouraging, or of gradua- 
tions.— (Twenty-fourth report.) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
There being no institution for the blind in the District, the Government, up to 
1880-81, continued to make provision for them in the Maryland Institution for the 
Blind. During the year the United States beneficiaries from the District numbered 17, 
9 males and 8 females, most of them said to be bright and promising scholars. Their 
studies reached as high as algebra, geometry,. history, and rhetoric, with vocal and in- 
strumental music, the institution having 10 pianos and a grand organ with water motor. 
The industries were piano-tuning, broom and mattress making, chair caning, plain and 
fancy sewing, knitting, and use of sewing machine.— (Twenty-fourth report.) 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Reform School of the District of Columbia (1869) up to July 1, 1881, had received 
713 boys; during the year it had 219 under training, 60 of them committed in 1881 and 
67 discharged on good behavior, while 14 left without consent. Of the 60 committed, 
75 per cent. were 12 to 15 years of age, 7 were orphans, 11 fatherless, 12 motherless, 
while only 30 had both parents living. Neither accident nor death had occurred during 
the year; progress in studies was very satisfictory, as were also results of the industries 
on the farm and in the. garden and shops, in which last the boys were trained in shoe- 
making, tailoring, and chair caning. Many improvements around the buildings were 
completed, and additional land, purchased with money from the estate of Jay Cooke & 
Co., was put under cultivation.— (Report. ) 
The Industrial Home School, Georgetown (1864), supplies a much needed charity. It is 
neither an orphan asylum nor a reformatory school. It is a child saving institution,

receiving children of either sex who are left in such a condition as to endanger their 
future welfare, such as orphans and children of dissolute and destitute parents. While 
providing a Christian home for such, it aims to give amoderate amount of education for 
head and hand. For 1880-’81 it reported 109 inmates. The school department is or- 
ganized and furnished with teachers by the District board of trustees of public schools. 
For the children below the school age there is a Kindergarten. The industries are work 
on grounds around the buildings, in the garden and greenhouse, in carpentry, shoe- 
making, general housework, and sewing. During the year a greenhouse was completed 
and put in operation, the grounds were graded and ornamented, swimming and fish 
ponds excavated, and foundations laid for a cottage. Congress appropriated toward its 
support $10,000. — (Report. ) 
CHILDREN’S HOMES AND ORPHAN ASYLUMS. 
St. Joseph’s Male Orphan Asylum (1855) reported 110 inmates for 1880-’81; St. Vincent’s 
Female Orphan Asylum, 115; while the Branch St. Vincent Female Orphan and Industrial 
Asylum had 40. The 2 former give elementary instruction in school studies and house- 
hold industries. The pupils of the last are admitted at 13 to 20 years of age and are 
retained from 4 to 6 years, according to their capacity for instruction; are given a fair 
English education, with Germanand French, and trained in housekeeping, laundry work, 
and common and ornamental sewing. When thus prepared to teach or to do useful 
work in families they are furnished with suitable homes. ‘The institution is self sus- 
taining by the sale of the useful and ornamental work of the pupils.— (Special report. ) 
Washington City Orphan Asylum throughout its history of 67 years has been managed 
by the ladies of the city, and is entirely dependent on the charities of the public. It re- 
ported, for 1880-81, iéo inmates, mostly small boys and girls, taken from the desti- 
tution and poverty ‘of the city, of whom 5 were adopted, 9 indentured, 36 reclaimed 
by parents and friends, while 2 were sent to the reform school. For school instruction 
there are juvenile and senior departments. Dr. J. C. Hall, one of the trustees of the 
institution, left a bequest from which a memorial hall was nearly completed at the close 
of the year.— (Report. ) 
The German Protestant Orphan Asylum, Uniontown (1879), in its second annual state- 
ment, October, 1881, reported $3,453 received for its work and $3,360 expended. It had 
41 inmates, 21 boys and 20 girls, of whom 6 were whole and 35 half orphans. Children 
are admitted at from 3 to 11 years of age and trained in elementary studies; the boys 
are also taught garden work and the girls housework and sewing. Atsuitableages they 
are placed in homes under the care of officers of the institution till of age. ‘The asso- 
ciation received during the year, through congressional aid, a deed in fee simple for the 
whole property. 
The National Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Women and Chitar en Was incor- 
porated by an act of Congress in 1863 to provide for such a suitable home, board, clothing, 
and instruction, and to bring them under Christian influence. Duly appointed officers 
are to enforce discipline, impart instruction in useful knowledge and in some regular 
, course of labor, and establish rules for the preservation of health as well as for physical, 
intellectual, and moral improvement, and to bind out by indenture such children as 
may be deemed capable of learning a trade. During 1881 there were 135 inmates, of 
whom 7 were old women and 128 children. The school of the home was made a part 
of the public school system of the District in February, 1880, since which time it is 
reported to have made marked progress, the standard during the year being raised to 
comprise 3 grades. All the children of 6 years of age and upward were enrolled in the 
school, averaging 65.8 per cent. of the inmates. In the industrial department there 
were made by the children 1,891 articles of bedding, clothing, and all else used in the 
institution, except hats and shoes, besides 102 pairs of stockings knit by the children and 
aged women. Only in exceptional cases are children admitted under 3 years of age, and 
none retained beyond the age of 11 or 12, or until suitable homes are found for them. 
An appropriation of $6,535 from Congre: cknowledged for 1881.— (Nineteenth report. ) 
TRAINING OF NURSES. 
The Sieciiistod Training School for Nurses (187 7) reported, for 1880-81, 7 instructors, 
24 pupils (making 40 since opening), and 3 graduates, all of whom continued in the pro- 
fession. ‘The full course of studies covers 2 years of 42 weeks each. The only income 
was from membership dues. The demand for trained nurses was increasing, and grad- 
uates are certain of constant and remunerative employment. For admission, candidates 
must be not less than 20 years of age and must furnish evidence of good moral char- 
acter and sound health. ‘The second year must be passed in nursing in hospitals and 
private families, under the direction of teachers, at the close of which time those who 
have fully met all the requirements and have passed a satisfactory examination receive 
a diploma.— (Return and fourth ee

299 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TRAINING IN ART AND MUSIC. 
The School of the Washington Art Club, under Mr. Edmund Clarence Messer, proceeds 
upon the idea of individual instruction in drawing with pencil, coal, or crayon by pro- 
fessional methods. No classes are formed, but each student is trained to examine objects 
for himself and to represent them as he sees them. There is, consequently, no drawing 
from the flat, but only from models, from nature, and from life, instruction in perspective 
being given throughout. The school is yet in its infancy, but hopes to enter, before long, 
into ne quarters, with greater facilities for useful and effective work.— (Personal infor- 
mation. 
In the Art School of Mrs. 8. E. Fuller (who gives lessons in the public schools on the 
Walter Smith system) the plan of instruction is essentially the same as that of Mr. Messer, 
above mentioned, individual instruction being given to each student and each being 
trained to study nature and the works of those who best interpret her. A collection of 
casts and models enables students to study object drawing. Life classes are taught on 
two days of the week. A class of 47 students appears in the catalogue for 1880-’81.— 
(Twelfth catalogue. ) 
The Rouzee Art School of Mr. W. M. Rouzee employs the method known as the block 
system, which, after a pupil has become familiar with the rudiments of plain perspec- 
tive, consists in drawing the outline of objects, or groups of objects, and the shadows 
belonging to them by straight lines and angles showing height and breadth at different 
points. ‘The eye is thus trained to the true character of curves and angles. Pupils in 
1881, oe 2 instructors, 132; largest average monthly attendance, 105.— (Letter and 
circular. ‘ 
Mrs. Imogene R. Morrell, of the National Academy of Fine Arts, instructs through- 
out the year persons of all ages in the principles of art according to the methods of the 
European schools in which she has studied. 
Washington Conservatory of Music (1868), under the direction of Mr. O. B. Bullard, with 
12instructors, embraces teaching onthepiano, organ, violin, flute, guitar, and orchestral 
instruments, musical notation, cultivation of the voice (including elocution and vocal 
technique), thorough bass, harmony, counterpoint, composition, and the art of teaching. 
Pupils are classed in first, medium, and advanced grades of a year each, although instruc- 
tion s given mainly on the idea of individual peculiarities of taste and capacity.— (Cir- 
cular, 
The School of Music (1877), Theo. Ingalls King, principal, offers to pupils the ser- 
vices of teachers in such branches as the student may elect, including nearly the same as 
that above mentioned. The methods of instruction are by private lessons or in small 
classes, each pupil having the advantage of individual attention. A catalogue for 1880-’81 
shows 84 pupils for that year.— (Circular and catalogue.)

(From returns of Hon. James L. Onderdonk, territorial superintendent of public 
instruction, for the two years indicated.) 
TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
These are, for the Territory, a controller, who is ex officio territorial superintendent 
of public instruction; for each county, an auditor, who acts as county school superin- 
tendent (except in 2 counties, where the probate judge acts), and a county school exam- 
iner, appointed by the board of ‘county commissioners, who, with the county superin- 
tendent, constitutes a county board of school examiners; for each district, 3 trustees, 
elected annually by the voters of the district. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The schools are sustained by the interest of an irreducible and indivisible school fund, 
by county taxes of not less than two and not more than eight mills on each $1 of tax- 
able property, by the amounts received from fines and forfeitures for breaches of the 
penal laws, and by a sum derived from teachers’ examination fees of $3 from every 
successful applicant before receiving a certificate. A rate bill, not exceeding $25 for 
repairs to school property, may be levied on parents and guardians of children attend- 
ing school, but the children are not to be denied school privileges if their parents and 
guardians are unable to pay such tax. For a district to receive its amount of school 
funds, at least 10 children must have been reported by the census marshal and the schools 
must have taught no political, sectarian, or denominational doctrines, nor have had such 
papers, tracts, or documents distributed therein. The basis of distribution of the terri- 
torial school fund is according to the number of children between 5 and 21 years of age 
in each county; but as each county constitutes at least one school district, irrespective 
 
-P-A-G-E-570
: 
292 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
of the-number of children of school age therein, one-half is to be divided equally among 
the several districts of the Territory complying with the law; the other half, in propor- 
tion to the number of children of school age enumerated in the county, except in 2 coun- 
ties, which have a different arrangement. New districts receive their per capita propor- 
tion out of the school funds of the old districts from which they are formed; but, failing 
to keep the schools open three months and to report them according to law during the 
first year, the money must be refunded. Teachers considered competent to hold posi- 
tions after examination by the board of examiners receive certificates good for two years 
showing the branches they are authorized to teach.— (School law, 1879.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The superintendent of public instruction, in making his report for the year 1881, 
states that a degree of substantial progress has been reached, notwithstanding the poor 
system of supervision and lack of funds. The statistics are so meagre for both 1880 and 
1881 that it is difficult to make a fair comparison, although there has been an increase 
at some points. Graded schools have been established at Boisé City and at Lewiston, 
the building in Lewiston costing $10,000. Out of 129 districts giving information as to 
the condition of school buildings, 84 reported them in good condition, 34 in bad condi- 
tion, 12 as improperly heated and ventilated, 2 as having insufficient grounds, and 1 as not 
properly drained. 
ADVANCED INSTRUCTION. 
NORMAL AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, COLLEGES, &C.

SCHOOL SYSTEMS AMONG THE INDIANS. 
OFFICERS. 
As far as can be ascertained, the educational officers of the civilized tribes in the Indian 
Territory continued in 1881 to be as last reported, viz, among the Cherokees, a board of 
education of 3 members, nominated by the principal chief and confirmed by the tribal 
senate for terms of 3 years, one to be changed each year, with a board of 3 directors for 
each primary school, appointed by the board of education, to hold during good behavior; 
among the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, and Seminoles, superintendents of public 
schools, for general oversight, with trustees for local supervision of the schools of the 
districts into which the territory of each tribe is divided. 
The United States Government, through its Commissioner of Indian Affairs, largely 
intrusts educational work for other Indians within the Indian Territory and elsewhere 
 
-P-A-G-E-572
  294 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
(except in Alaska) to the several religious associations authorized by it to labor for the 
civilization of the different tribes. At Hampton, Va.; Carlisle, Pa.; Forest Grove, Oreg., 
and some other places, the principals of special schools, also authorized by the Government, 
continued, in 1881, to have supervision of the training of many Indian youth of both 
sexes, sent to them by the chiefs and head men of numerous tribes for education in or- 
dinary studies and in useful industries. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEMS. 
The Cherokee board of education, above mentioned, makes rules for the government 
of the schools of all kinds belonging to the nation, while each of the local trustees, who 
together compose the board, has supervision of the schools in the district to which he be- 
longs. The members of the board examine all persons desiring to teach, and grant cer- 
tificates to approved teachers according to qualification. Each is required also to ascer- 
tain the number of youth of school age (7-21) in his district and in the subdistricts of 
which it is composed, and such children are put under his control, to be sent to their 
proper schools at the expense of the Cherokee Nation till their 3 years of primary educa- 
tion are completed. Then such as desire the fuller 4 years’ training of the higher schools 
may be sent to these at the expense of parents or guardians for board only, tuition still 
being free. They may also afterwards be sent to schools in the States. Substantially 
the same arrangements as to primary and higher training appear to prevail in the other 
4 civilized tribes, under the direction of their superintendents and trustees. 
Among the uncivilized Indians there is no uniform system as to studies or methods, 
each missionary or missionary association doing what seems best; but there is evidently 
an increasing disposition to gather the children into boarding schools, where they can 
be more easily protected against the degradation of barbarous rites and habits, more reg- 
ularly taught, kept under better discipline, and trained in ‘‘ white men’s ways’’ and in- 
dustries. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
As may be seen from the table of statistics, the schools of the Five Nations of civilized 
Indians enrolled 6,183 out of a reported school population of only 9,315, while, of those 
enrolled, 4 of the nations report 3,496 in average attendance, the Creeks making no re- 
turn on this point. Of the comparatively uncivilized tribal Indians throughout the coun- 
try, 8,109 out of 38,923 of school age were in the schools held for them, 4,976 of the en- 
rolled being in average attendance. These figures indicate a considerable advance in 
educational interest among the civilized, especially as two of their chief school buildings 
were burned in 1880-81, while they were greatly troubled during the year by the in- 
cursions of lawless whites into their territory. The advance among the wilder tribes 
was also great, both the increased enrolment and increased average attendance indicat- 
ing this, although they too were in many cases troubled by encroachments of the whites. 
‘The day schools among uncivilized Indians fell off 3; but the better and more influential 
boarding schools were 8 more in number. Among the additional schools opened were 
2 for the mission Indians of California, who, from their peacefulness, their poverty, and 
their industrious ways, appear to have fairly merited an increase of advantages for edu- 
cation. Six of the 8 new boarding schools for Indians in Utah, Arizona, and New Mex- 
ico were meant to accommodate 351 pupils, and are said to have been the first ever pro- 
vided for the 27,000 Indians of those regions, who represent a school population of not 
Jess than 5,000. The remaining 2 new ones were established at Cheyenne River agency, 
Dakota, and among the Omahas of Nebraska. In all, 3 new school buildings for Indian 
use were completed, furnished, and occupied during 1880-’81, 8 more were made ready 
for occupation, and 5 others were in progress. 
COMBINED EDUCATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
To fully civilize the Indians, it has become clearly apparent that instruction in the 
arts of life must be connected with training in school studies. This connection has 
for several years been more and more attempted at several of the best Indian agencies 
and has been fostered by the authority of the Indian Office, especially at the schools for 
Indian youth assisted or sustained by it at Carlisle, Pa., Forest Grove, Oreg., and Hamp- 
ton, Va. The pupils for these schools, as well as those for some less conspicuous ones 
elsewhere, have been chosen from different tribes (for their intelligence, character, and 
strength) to acquire a knowledge of such studies, arts, and habits as may enable them to 
aid in the civilization of their people. They are trained m the English language, in the 
ordinary school studies, in submission to discipline, in the orderly habits of civilized 
domestic life, and in the common mechanical and domestic industries. These, for the 
boys, include farm and garden work, carpentry, tailoring, the making of tin ware, black- 
smithing, shoe, harness, and wagon making; for the girls, sewing, cookery, care of rooms 
and beds, nursing, and whatever will conduce to domestic comfort. The reports of 
 
-P-A-G-E-573

progress made show that time only is required to solve the domestic part of the Indian 
problem by a continuation of this system; for intelligent agents, appointed by the Gov- 
ernment, declare, after full inspection, that for the time during which these youth have 
been under instruction the advance observed in school studies, in industries, in habits, 
and in manners has been wonderful, and would be regarded as unusual in children taken 
from American homes for like training. . 
The number subjected to this training for the year was, at Carlisle, 295; at Hampton, 
81; at Forest Grove, 76. 
NORMAL AND SECONDARY TRAINING. 
Education for teaching and for business is given to some extent not only in the schools 
above described, but also in the Santee Normal Training School, Santee Agency, Nebr., 
in St. Paul’s Boarding School, Yankton Reserve, Nebr., and in the higher schools of the 
Five Nations, all for Indian youth. No training beyond this had been instituted for 
them in 1881. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
COL. PETER P. PITCHILYNN. 
This famous Choctaw half-breed, who died in Washington, D. C., January 17, 1881, 
had been during a long life one of the chief agents in the civilization and education of 
his tribe. The child of a Choctaw mother and a white who had served as an interpreter 
between the whites and Indians under a commission from General Washington, of fine 
physique and gifted with clear intelligence, he attracted in his prime the attention of 
Charles Dickens as one of nature’s-noblemen. He was born in the Indian town of Hoo- 
shookwa, Miss., January 30, 1806, when the Chickasaws and Choctaws owned a large 
part of that State. Resolving early to obtain an education, he went to a school in Ten- 
nessee, 200 miles away, carrying on his studies subsequently at the Columbia Academy, 
in the same State, and graduating finally at the University of Nashville. Returning 
thus educated to his people he exerted with great success his now developed powers in 
the repression of polygamy and intemperance. As a member of the national council of 
the Choctaws, to which he was soon elected, he made the first move for the establishment 
of schools, and set the example, which has been since followed at Carlisle and Hampton, 
of placing the first scheol among the whites, that other civilizing influences might oper- 
ate with educational ones for the elevation and improvement of the youth brought under 
instruction. In 1828 he was made the leader of the expedition organized under Govern- 
ment auspices for the removal of the five tribes to the present Indian Territory, and by 
his tact and skill succeeded in making an agreement for this removal with the hostile 
Osages, who then held that region. Thenceforth he was till his death the trusted repre- 
sentative of the Choctaws in all their business transactions with the General Government, 
except during the war of the rebellion, when he took decidedly the Union side and com- 
manded a Union Indian militia regiment, while many of the Choctaws were drawn into 
the confederate ranks from the force of early southern associations. On the return of 
peace he renewed his efforts on behalf of education, assisted to the utmost every move- 
ment in that direction, and is said to have been, more than any other one man, the 
parent of the Choctaw school system of neighborhood common schools and central higher 
schools, the funds for which he also did much to preserve.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A territorial superintendent of public instruction, appointed by the governor and con- 
firmed by the legislative council fora term of 2 years, has general charge of public school 
affairs. Local officers are county superintendents, elected by the people for 2 years; dis- 
trict boards of 3 trustees, elected for 3 years, 1 going out each year; and a district clerk 
for each district, elected annually. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are sustained from a county tax of not less than 3 normore than 5 mills 
on the dollar; district taxes, voted by the people; and fines, penalties, and proceeds of 
the sale of town lots in the hands of probate judges. All moneys derived from the sale 
of any school lands which may ‘be granted by Congress are to constitute an irreducible 
school fund, the interest of which is to be used for public school purposes. A sehool 
 
-P-A-G-E-575

census must be taken annually by district clerks, and the funds apportioned to districts 
according to the number of youth 4 to 21 resident therein. The age for free admission 
to school is 5 to 21, but trustees may receive adults and non-residents when there are 
good reasons for so doing. No apportionment can be made to districts which have not 
maintained a free public school for at least 3 months during the preceding school year, 
nor unless the teachers employed hold legal certificates in full force, nor if sectarian or 
partisan books have been used or political or denominational doctrines taught in the 
school. The elementary English branches are prescribed studies, and others may be 
added as deemed expedient by trustees, who may also open high schools. Instruction 
must be given during the entire course in manners, morals, and laws of health. Due 
attention must be given to the ventilation and temperature of school rooms, and health- 
ful physical exercises are to be provided for pupils. ‘Teachers must report annually to 
the county superintendent and to the district clerk or forfeit pay for the last month 
employed. Trustees report to county superintendents and the latter must report annu- 
ally to the territorial superintendent or forfeit $100 of their pay. County superintend- 
ents may, when they think best, hold institutes for teachers in all counties having 10 or 
more organized school districts. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show considerable increase in the school population during the year, and 
smaller advances in public school enrolment and average attendance. More school dis- 
tricts were organized, school-houses built, and schools taught, the average term being 
14 days longer. While only 30 more teachers’ certificates were issued than during the 
previous year, there were 50 more of first grade. Fewer men and more women were 
employed, the monthly pay of men being increased by $8.24 and that of women by $1.06. 
The territorial superintendent, from “personal observation, as well as from county re- 
ports, records a year of healthy growth of the public schools. The people contributed 
liberally to their support, raising over $15,000 more by taxation than the previous year, 
besides increasing the value of school property by more than $21,000. The average rate 
of taxation, 3.8 mills on the dollar, was nearly a mill above the minimum requirement, 
and 2 counties levied 5 mills, the full amount allowed by law. The low percentage of 
enrolment on census scholars is not owing to inefficiency of the schools, but rather to 
the sparseness of population and ¢onsequent distance of many pupils from school. One 
district in Meagher County contains about 4,000 square miles of territory and another 
in Gallatin County is 3 miles wide and 100 miles long. In the latter, the school-house 
stands near the centre; the patrons have built winter homes near by, and move there for 
the season in order to send their children to school. While much may be done, as in 
this instance, by determined effort on the part of parents, the difficulty cannot be en- 
tirely overcome until the population becomes more numerous. The policy of divid- 
ing districts and multiplying schools, to which there is a tendency in some localities, 
brings no adequate relief, since it necessarily results in small schools and short terms. 
Other obstacles noted by the superintendent may be more easily overcome, such as a 
failure on the part of some parents to appreciate the benefits of education sufficiently to 
send their children to school. To compel the attendance of such by law, he thinks, may 
at no @istant day be considered both economical and humane. Too many studies, and 
hence too many classes for one teacher, short school terms, and a great variety of text 
books have hindered progress, particularly in the ungraded schools. The last named 
evil was remedied by the adoption by the legislature in February, 1881, of a uniform 
series of text books; for the first the superintendent recommends the arrangement of a 
course of study for ungraded schools similar to those which have been successfully used 
in other places. 
CITY SCHOOLS. 
PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR. 
The territorial superintendent reports great improvement in the schools of the princi- 
pal cities. A better classification of pupils was made during the year and more thorough 
work was done, particulary in the schools of Helena, Butte, Bozeman, Deer Lodge, and 
Virginia City, where courses of study have been adopted, including primary, interme- 
diate, and high school departments. The school buildings are handsome and well ar- 
ranged, and are supplied with improved styles of furniture, libraries, apparatus, and 
musical instruments. In Helena, the largest of the above (with 3,624 population), there 
were 562 pupils enrolled and 316 in average attendance, under 11 “teachers. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
INSTITUTES. 
A successful institute was held at Butte during the month of March for the teachers 
of Deer Lodge and Silver Bow Counties, and another at Virginia City in August for the
-P-A-G-E-576

298 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
teachers of Madison County. It was expected that others would be held during the 
year, but no positive information regarding them has been received and no statistics of 
attendance at those which were held are given. ‘The territorial superintendent says the 
importance of these meetings cannot be called in question; that they stimulate and en- 
courage teachers and prepare them to do better work. He thinks, however, that the law 
which makes it the duty of teachers to attend county institutes and take part in the ex- 
ercises would be more effective if some penalty were attached to its violation. 
NORMAL COURSES. 
A department for the training of teachers was, at last accounts, connected with the 
high school at Helena, but no information has been received from it for 1880-81. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
As already stated, high school departments are connected with the graded system in 
Helena, Butte, Bozeman, Deer Lodge, and Virginia City, and possibly there may be some 
in other places. In those of the cities named particularly good work was done during 
the year. The course of study comprised the higher mathematics, natural science, and 
the languages. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private academies or seminaries reporting, see Table VI of the appen- 
dix, and for a sun:mary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
. SUPERIOR AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
TERRITORIAL UNIVERSITY. 
The superintendent believes the time is near at hand for the establishment of a terri- 
torial university. In 1881 Congress passed an act granting 72 sections of the unappro- 
priated lands of Montana for university purposes; but owing to conditions attached to 
its sale the benefits of this grant cannot be realized in time to meet the more immediate 
demands of the rising generation. He therefore advises the establishment of at least 3 
departments of a territorial university at as early a day as practicable, the departments 
thought most essential being a school of mines, a normal school, and a scientific and 
classical school. 
No information has reached this Office of any scientific, theological, legal, or medical 
schools in this Territory. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
In accordance with a law providing for the education of the deaf-mute and blind chil- 
dren of Montana, 2 deaf-mutes are being educated at the Columbia Institution, Kendall 
Green, near Washington, D. C., at an annual expense to the Territory of $306 each, 
this covering board, tuition, clothing, and medical attendance.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A territorial board of education, comprising the governor, the secretary of the Terri- 
tory, judges of the supreme court, and the Roman Catholic bishop of New Mexico, was 
created in 1863 and still appears to have a nominal existence. The same law provided 
for a territorial superintendent, to he appointed by the governor with consent of the 
legislative council for a term of 2 years; but in 1874 the duties of this office were trans- 
ferred to the territorial librarian. Local officers are county boards of supervisors or 
commissioners of 3 members elected by the people for 2 years. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
As the governor remarks in his report to the Secretary of the Interior, the legislature 
has from time to time passed acts relating to education which being liberally construed 
constitute a respectable school system, although not a complete one. The chief trouble, 
he says, lies in neglect to execute the law, which in some localities is not carried out at all 
and in others but indifferently. The system provides for compulsory education during 
5 months of the year; for free schools, open to all children without regard to religious 
creed, nativity, or condition; also, for reports of school statistics from county officers to 
the territorial librarian and from him to the legislature. One-fourth of a tax of 1 per 
cent. on the property of the Territory and a poll tax of $1 on each voter are set apart 
for the support of public schools. These funds, a correspondent writes, if properly col- 
lected and honestly turned over, would be sufficient to keep up a fair average school in 
every school district for 3 months in the year; but they are not always or even generally 
so collected and applied. The county sheriff is tax collector, and the school commission- 
ers have no control over the funds. 
 
-P-A-G-E-578
  300 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
GENERAL CONDITION. ‘ 
In the absence of territorial reports on education the United States census for 1880 
furnishes the latest information respecting schools in New Mexico. From a lack of 
statistics for the year preceding or for any other recent years, it is impossible to institute 
comparisons showing progress or otherwise. A decided advance appears, however, dur- 
ing the decade. With about the same number of youth to be educated there were 4,755 
attending all classes of schools in 1880 against 1,798 in 1870. ‘The governor thinks a 
disposition to encourage education is rapidly growing and intelligence becoming more 
general through the agency of newspapers, which have been established in all the prin- 
cipal towns. A scattered population and the prevalence of two languages he mentions 
as great difficulties in the way of prosperous schools in this Territory, and thinks it may 
be wise for Congress to deal with the subject so far as to see that the true Americanidea 
of public schools be carried out, ample and equal advantages be provided for all elasses, 
and aid afforded if necessary from the National Treasury. 
From a sketch of the educational condition prepared by Hon. W. G. Ritch, secretary 
of the Territory, it appears that parochial and academic schools are sustained in all the 
more important towns and neighborhoods by the Roman Catholic Church, under the 
control of the Jesuits, the Christian Brothers, the Sisters of Loretto, and the Sisters of 
Charity, and that the various Protestant. denominations are also represented in the 
larger towns by primary and academic schools. He saysthe Roman Catholic schools are 
largely supported in most of the counties by the public school funds and those of other 
denominations generally by tuition fees or private contributions or both, the greater 
part of the private funds coming from outside of the Territory. He thinks the present 
system might by proper management produce good schools, as it does even now in a few 
instances, although as a whole its workings are most unsatisfactory. But, since the 
territorial legislature cannot be induced to make the changes necessary to an efficient 
administration, and considering the peculiar difficulties existing here, he advises that 
relief be sought in congressional legislation. Among the features he would have thus 
established are a territorial board of education, comprising the governor, secretary, three 
judges of the supreme court, president of the council, and speaker of the house; the 
secretary to be superintendent of schools; the board to have full power, under general 
restrictions, to make all Jaws necessary for the establishment and government of the 
schools; school taxes tobe paid ovef to the proper officer out of the first moneys collected, 
subject to the order of the board, and an equal sum to that raised by tax to be appropri- 
ated from national funds; the schools to be taught in the English language, but the study 
of Spanish also to be allowed when desirable.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The public school officers are a territorial superintendent of district schools, elected for 
2 years; a county superintendent of the schools in each county, elected for the same 
term; and 3 trustees for each school district, who are elected at first for terms of 1, 2, 
and 3 years, and subsequently each for 3 years. Boards of examination consisting of 3 
persons are appointed by each county court to examine teachers and grant certificates. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
School moneys are derived from a tax of 3 mills on $1 of ordinary property, from tax~ 
ation of railroads, sale of estrays, and a special district tax, not to exceed 2 per cent. a 
year and to be levied only by a two-thirds vote of the taxpayers. These moneys are 
apportioned on the basis of the number of youth of school age. It is the duty of trust- 
ees to employ teachers; to provide school-houses, furniture, and apparatus; to visit 
officially each school in their district at least once each term; and to take an annual 
census of children 6 to 18 years of age. They may at their option collect tuition fees. 
The territorial and county superintendents and the president of the University of Des- 
eret in convention determine what text books shall be used in the district schools, and 
books thus adopted cannot be changed within 5 years. Persons eligible to employment 
as teachers must hold a certificate as to their capacity and moral character. The 
normal certificate of graduation from the University of Deseret, indorsed by the board  
-P-A-G-E-580
  
    é

of examiners as to the moral character of the applicant, entitles the holder to be chosen 
as a teacher in any of thedistrict schools. Theamended school law of 1880 changed the 
school age from 6-16 to 6-18, the first enumeration of children of the extended age heing 
required to be taken on or before the second Monday in June, 1880, and at the same 
time annually afterwards.! 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
A comparison of the statistics for 1880-81 with those for the preceding year shows an 
increase in youth of school age, in enrolment and average attendance, in number of dis- 
tricts reporting and of schools, in length of term, and in whole number of teachers, there 
being fewer men but a much greater number of women. A financial gain is shownin 
increased valuation of school property and in greater receipts to meet the growing ex- 
penses. The superintendent says, too, that in his visitation of the schools he found 
much improvement in the style and quality of many new school-houses, as well as in the 
qualifications of a considerable number of the teachers, the normal classes of Brigham 
Young Academy, Provo,*of Brigham Young College, Logan, and of the University of 
Deseret now graduating from 30 to 40 yearly. ’ 
ANTI-MORMON SCHOOLS. 
There were 60 schools of this class in the Territory in 1880-’81, in most cases sup- 
ported by and under the control of Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. Among 
the number of those reporting were 36 elementary schools (part of them free, others 
asking a small tuition fee), with an aggregate attendance of 1,760. For those of aca- 
demic rank reporting, see Table VI of the appendix, and a summary of the same in the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
The law appropriates $5,000 a year for the University of Deseret, provided 40 pupils 
annually shall be instructed, free of charge for tuition, books, and apparatus, in its nor- 
mal department. Said pupils are to be selected by the territorial superintendent from 
persons nominated by the board of examination of the several counties, on condition 
that for each year’s free tuition received they shall teach one year in the district schools. 
The statistics for 1880-’81 are: Instructors, 2; students, 45; graduates, 18; course of 
study, 1 year of 40 weeks. ‘ 
A normal department, with a two years’ course, was reported in connection with Brig- 
ham Young Academy, Provo. There were 20 students in aztendance, 11 of whom ex- 
pected to graduate at the close of the year. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
While there is no territorial provision for the holding of institutes, such meetings are 
recommended by the superintendent; they seem to have been established and sustained 
in at least 2 counties and to have been productive of great good. 
SUPERIOR AND SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITY OF DESERET. 
There were in 1881 no institutions for superior or scientific instruction reported in the 
Territory, except the University of Deseret, Salt Lake, and it had only preparatory, 
academic, and normal departments. The course of study comprised English literature 
and history, geography and general history, mathematics, chemistry, physical and politi- 
cal science, natural history, Latin, and Greek. There were 3 instructors and 128 male 
and 74 female students in 1881.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The public school affairs of the Territory are intrusted to a territorial superintendent 
of public instruction, appointed for 2 years by the governor with the advice and consent 
of the legislative council, and to a territorial board of education, comprising the territo- 
rial superintendent and one suitable person from each judicial district, appointed by the 
governor for 2 years. For each county there are a county superintendent of common 
schools, elected by the people for 2 years, and a county board of examination, comprising 
the county superintendent and 2 teachers of the highest grade, chosen by him; for 
each district, a board of 3 directors, elected for 3 years, with annual change of one, and. 
a district clerk, elected for a like term. The directors of incorporated city or town dis- 
tricts may elect a city or town school superintendent, who may be one of the teachers 
and shall have control or management of all the schools in his district. Women are 
eligible to school offices and may vote at school meetings. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The moneys for the support of the public schools are derived from the interest on the 
fand accruing from the sale of lands donated by the United States, from county taxes of
-P-A-G-E-582
    304 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
3 to 6 mills on $1, and from fines for breach of license and penal laws. All school 
moneys apportioned by county superintendents to the several districts are apportioned 
according to the number of'youth ofschoolage. On the vote of qualified electors additional 
sums may be raised by special district tax, not to exceed 10 mills on $1 for maintaining 
schools or for building and farnishing school-houses; and in any school district composed 
of an incorporated city or town an additional tax of 5 mills may be levied for tuition 
purposes. Jn order to receive their portion of public school money, districts must have 
maintained a public school taught by a qualified teacher for at least three months the 
preceding year. Since 1881 each incorporated city or town has formed a school district, 
and all such districts having 300 or more school children are required to establish graded 
schools, but no other language than English and no mathematics higher than arithmet‘¢ 
may be taught therein. Two or more districts may unite to establish graded schools, 
and any single district may have the same power. District clerks must take an annual 
census of all persons between the ages of 4 and 21; failing to do thisat the proper time they 
areindividually liable for the full amount the district may lose thereby. The territorial 
board of education prescribes the text books to be used in the public schools and the 
methods of instruction and discipline. It is the duty of the territorial superintendentto 
hold annually a territorial institute; that of county superintendents, to hold annually 
county institutes. In order to draw pay, teachers must hold certificates in full force either 
from the territorial or a county board of examination. To obtain the former, which are 
good for 3 years in any part of the Territory, the applicant for examination must hold a first 
grade county certificate and must have taught for 3 years; the latter are of 3 grades, good 
for 1, 2, and 3 years in the county where issued. Teachers must keep a register and 
must make an annual report to the county superintendent or forfeit their last month’s 
pay. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The figures respecting the general educational condition in the two years under com- 
parison are so incomplete that they fail to indicate decisively the measure of advance or 
retrogression in 1880-81. The returns, too, are said to be imperfect. As far as given, 
they show that with a school population reported nearly 3,000 less than in 1879-80 
there was yet an enrolment in the public schools only 26 short of that reported the year 
before, while average daily attendance was greater by 729, although the school-houses 
for the reception of public pupils appear to have been fewer by 43 and the teachers in 
them fewer still. Receipts for public schools were larger than they had been; the ex- 
penditure for them is not given. 
CHANGE OF SCHOOL LAW. 
A revision in 1881 of that part of the school law which related to cities and towns 
made each incorporated one a school district; changed the number of school children 
required for a graded district from 500 to 300; limited the instruction to be given in 
such districts, as above indicated, to studies in English branches and arithmetic; and 
gave permission to levy in them, with consent of voters, a building tax of 10 mills in 
any year and a tuition tax of 5 mills. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. 
The normal department of the University of Washington, Seattle, gives a 2 years’ 
course that includes the higher English branches and methods of teaching. There were 
12 students in the senior preparatory, 8 in the first class, and 2 graduates reported for 
this department in 1880-81. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
In counties containing 10 or more organized school districts the law requires the 
county superintendent to hold annually a teachers’ institute, makes it the duty of the 
teachers to attend and participate in the exercises thereof, and permits them to adjourn 
their schools during the session of the institute. This requirement was generally com- 
plied with in 1880-’81, as there were 33 institutes reported, some counties holding more 
than one. The meetings in several counties were large and enthusiastic. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS AND OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The superintendent of public instruction reports 10 graded schools in the Territory, 
but gives no information in regard to public high schools. The United States Census
-P-A-G-E-583
  
WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 305 
gives 5 high schools or schools with high school departments, but does not distinguish 
the number of pupils attending or the teachers employed in these schools from others, 
as was done in 1850 and in 1860 for the country generally. 
For statistics of private academic schools reporting, see Table VI of the appendix, and 
for asummary, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 
The University of Washington Territory, Seattle, open alike to both sexes, is a part 
of the public school system and is supported by legislative appropriations, interest on 
endowment, and tuition fees. It offers 4 years’ classical and scientific courses, leading 
to appropriate degrees, and 2 years’ normal and commercial courses. A course of law 
lectures was delivered to students in 1880-’81 and will become a permanent feature of 
the university. There were 137 students enrolled: 27 in the collegiate department, 
which includes the advanced classical, scientific, normal, and commercial students, and 
33 in the senior and 77 in the junior preparatory classes. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
WASHINGTON TERRITORY TRACHERS? INSTITUTE. 
Information in regard to the opening exercises of the sixth annual meeting of this 
body at New Tacoma is wanting. At the evening session held August 17, 1881, R. C. 
Townsend delivered a lecture upon the question ‘‘Is teaching a profession?’’ The fol- 
lowing day, which was the closing one, G. W. Mattice, of New Tacoma, presented 
“Methods of teaching the greatest common divisor and least common multiple,’’ which 
was fully discussed. Prof. F. P. Gilman, Seattle, spoke on ‘‘Mineralogy in the public 
schools by object lessons.’’ The subject of ‘‘ Reading’ was taken up and several essays 
read. At the afternoon session methods of teaching arithmetic were discussed. Mrs. 
L. P. Anderson delivered an address on botany and Superintendent Houghton a lecture 
on physiology. Methods of classification and management of schools were spoken of 
by F. E. Eldridge, of Slaughter, and C. A. Gilbert, of Riverside. With appropriate re- 
marks by Dr. Houghton, Prof. A. J. Anderson, and others, the institute adjourned, to 
hold its seventh annual meeting at Seattle.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The territorial librarian continued to be ex officio superintendent of public instruction 
for the Territory; for counties there were superintendents elected by the people every 2 
years; and for school districts boards of 3 trustees, each elected for 3 years, 1 being 
changed each year.— (School laws, 1878.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are sustained from a poll tax of $2 on each voter, from 2 mills on 
$1 of all taxable property, and from the proceeds of fines and forfeitures. 
The people at the annual district meeting may vote a district tax to supply any de- 
ficiency in the teachers’ fund, to lease or purchase sites and build and keep in repair 
school-houses, to supply them with necessary fuel and appendages, and to purchase school 
libraries and books for indigent children, the sum for library not to exceed $100 in any 
one year. Women of 21 years of age may vote for and be elected as school officers, and 
as teachers are to receive the same pay as men if equally qualified. Where there are 15 
or more colored children in a school district, a separate school for them may be estab- 
lished, but legally established district schools are equally free to all children resident 
therein over 7 and under 21 years of age; and a compulsory law requires parents and 
guardians, under a penalty of $25 fine, to send their children of 7 to 16 years of age to 
some public school at least 3 months each year or present reasons for their absence. 
Persons without higher certificates offering to teach must be examined by the county 
superintendent, whose certificate is good for 1 year, and must make reports of school 
statistics at the close of each term or forfeit their pay, at the discretion of the district

/ 
board. The county superintendent and the district board of directors may decide 
whether a school of higher grade than the ordinary district school shall be established 
in the district, may locate and erect a suitable house for said school, and may decide the 
number of teachers to be employed and studies to be pursued, this last subject to the 
decision of the Territorial Teachers’ Institute, which determines ordinarily every 5 years 
the studies of the like grade of schools in the Territory. This institute must be held 
annuaily and continue in session not less than 4 nor more than 10 days, and be free to 
all teachers and those preparing to teach in the Territory. It must decide upon the 
books and the system of instruction to be used in the Territory, and also decide upon the 
manner, place, and time of holding institutes in each county.— (School laws.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The governor states in his message to the legislature that the public schools in 1881 
continued to prosper, that new ones were opened, that liberal sums were expended for 
the erection of new school buildings and the enlargement of old ones, and that great 
efforts were made in the larger towns to secure experienced and efficient teachers, who 
did good work when secured. The graded schools, though laboring under the many 
disadvantages of a new Territory, compared favorably, he says, with schools of like 
general character in the States most advanced. 
The school system is claimed to be one of the best. As yet there is no indication of 
any institution belonging to the public school system of a higher grade than the high 
school. In the absence of corresponding data for two years, few comparisons can be 
made between 1880 and 1881, and these indicate the same number of schools in the latter 
ye: s in the former, but with fewer teachers, a smaller average rate of pay, and a 
smalier enrolment. 
At a few points in the Territory libraries were begun, and it was urged that some- 
thing in this direction worthy the intelligence and liberality of the people be undertaken 
without further delay. 
One thing which may go to promote education in the future is the organization at the 
capital, in 1881, of an association for the encouragement of historical and scientific 
research, the promotion of the practical industries of the Territory, the collection and 
preservation of authentic records of territorial history, the formation of historical, 
scientific, and industrial museums, and the enlargement of the territorial library, 
which was already of considerable size and for 1880 and 1881 received additions of about 
700 volumes yearly. 
Another important point was an appropriation by Congress in 1881 of 22 sections of 
public land for a future university.

    308 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS. 
NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE GENERAL ASSOCIATION. 
By invitation of Hon. Gustavus J. Orr, State school commissioner of Georgia, the 
National Educational Association held its twentieth annual meeting at Atlanta, Ga,, July 
19-22, 1881. An unusual interest attached to this meeting in the far South, and im- 
portant educational results were expected from it. The meeting was called to order by 
President Smart, of Indiana, and opened with prayer by Rev. Dr. Gwin, of Atlanta. 
Governor Colquitt then gave the address of welcome, in which he said: ‘‘If I could con- 
vey to you a complete sense of our esteem and of our admiration, indeed you would be 
prompted to believe that in this city and on Georgia soil the schoolmaster is at home, 
and nowhere else is his noble mission more honored.’? Responses were made by the 
president and others, and were followed by the inaugural address of the president, 
*¢On the value of schools.’’ Prof. C. C. Rounds, principal of the State Normal School, 
Farmington, Me., then read a paper on the ‘‘Lines of advance in education,’’ show- 
ing that teaching is assuming a more definitely professional character; that methods of 
teaching have advanced; and that courses of study have been extended from classics and 
mathematics to cover the realms of science, art, and industry; that a transition from 
principle to application is going on, resulting in an extensive conviction that ability to 
work is a necessity for all; that the only safe state is that in which work is honorable 
and well rewarded; and that the training of the hand is as legitimate a function of the 
school as the training of the head. Then followed a paper on ‘‘ What shall we teach in 
our elementary schools?’’ by Superintendent A. J. Rickoff, of Cleveland, Ohio, who in 
a long and well arranged paper said that much in the curriculum of the elementary 
schools, if tested by its practical value in the pursuits of life, would be cast aside as 
worthless. The discussion which followed developed a considerable difference of views. 
General Eaton, United States Commissioner of Education, opened the evening session of 
the general association with an address on ‘‘ Education and the building of the state,’’ the 
leading point of which was that to build a state is not to locate a certain number of 
people in a given territory. It is to build up the whole body politic in its interests, in- 
dividual, social, civil; its ideas, doctrines, sentiments, laws, customs, and institutions. 
To understand man, we must look at him in combination with his fellows. It is in so- 
ciety that he first feels what he is and first becomes what he can be. The earliest and 
simplest form of association is the family. This enlarges itself naturally into the clan 
and tribe, which then, by combining, form states, federations, and nations. Tracing the 
history of ancient in contrast with that of modern nations, he said that ‘‘the motion of 
the ancients in the effort to reach truth was like that of the rocking horse, while that 
of the moderns is more like the course of the thoroughbred racer.’’ This speech closed 
with some remarks eulogistic of President Garfield, which were received with great 
applause. After the announcement from the chair of the committee for nominating offi- 
cers the association attended a complimentary banquet at the opera house, tendered by 
the citizens and teachers of Atlanta, over 500 invitations to which were issued. The 
tables were spread with an elegant collation, choice music was furnished, and the social 
exercises were continued till an early hour in the morning. 
“Some essentials in the development of a school system,’’ by Hon. D. F. De Wolf, 
State commissioner of common schools of Ohio, opened the morning session of the second 
day. Thispaper, prepared with great care and ability, urged the necessity and advantage 
of adding moral and esthetic instruction to that usually given in the public schools. 
The work of education, he said, is no longer confined to the teaching of the three R’s. 
It embraces the awakening of ideas relating to success in life. The state isnot interested 
alone in the intelligence of the individual, but much more in his relations to success in 
his special calling. Society is interested in the thrift of each individual, and demands 
not only the development of knowledge and skill, but that the virtues which are 
essential to the comfortable conditions of life be inculcated in the schools, such as self _ 
denial, prudence, and temperance, and a high regard for art, music, literature, &e. Men 
stand aghast at the prophetic rumblings of an unreasoning and relentless communism, 
and well they may. Ina more thorough study of this problem of public education and 
higher thoughts concerning it than have ever prevailed lies our only safeguard. There 
must be fullgrown men or women to conduct the public school system instead of unde- 
veloped boys and girls or martinets trained only in the narrow experiences of school
-P-A-G-E-587
  EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS. 309 
room life. The chief essential to the employment of talent and ability is such a warm 
social interest as will direct the best and most cultured minds to assume and maintain an 
interest in the work. Hence the coming system demands such a social position for the 
teacher as will render the highest culture available in the schools. So long as teachers 
are taken largely from classes whose narrow means force them to adopt teaching for a 
living, and are then denied social recognition, they should not be criticised for their 
shortcomings in the formation of character. Next came a paper by Prof. N. A. Calkins, 
assistant superintendent of the city of New York, on ‘‘ The teacher’s work in the develop- 
ment of mental and moral power.’’ He asked whether, when the teacher receives the 
pupil from the hand of nature and leads him into the school room, he takes up the work 
at the point where nature left it and conducts the youth onward in the same royal road? 
Knowledge of the being to be taught as well as of the subjects and methods of instruc- 
tion is indispensable to success in the development of power. Then, given a skilful 
teacher, with faithful labor and patient waiting, success will crown the work. Hon. M. 
A. Newell, State superintendent of public schools of Maryland, next read a paper on the 
proposed ‘ Revision of the common school curriculum,’’ in which he suggested (1) the 
addition of new subjects of instruction; (2) a new apportionment of the old studies with 
regard to the time devoted to them; (3) a rearrangement of studies in the order of time. 
Children should be taught morals, their duties to one other, the virtues of honesty, 
truthfulness, and purity; also, a few homely lessons in the laws of health. The revision, 
however, will be incomplete till there be added some form of manual industry. 
The evening session opened with a paper on ‘‘The necessity for spelling reform,’’ by 
T. R. Vickroy, of St. Louis, Mo., in which the historical claims of the current orthogra- 
phy were discussed and the hindrance it forms to the acquisition of useful knowledge by 
public school pupils was demonstrated by a reference to the meagre results of public 
nstruction in England and this country compared with the outlay made. A valuable 
paper was then read by Hon. J. P. Wickersham, long State superintendent of public 
instruction of Pennsylvania, on ‘‘The leading characteristics of American systems of 
education,’’ which, he said, as they exist here, may be regarded as indigenous, there being 
nothing in the Old World from which they could have been copied. The peculiar features 
ofthe American school systems generally are that the schools are open to all children of a 
proper age, without regard to sex, race, or rank, and largely without regard to color; that 
they dre free and unsectarian; that the National Government has no control; that the 
several States hold this control, and that even they have not much to do directly with 
the work of education, the real power resting much nearer the people, in the hands of 
the township and city governments, so near the people as to touch their homes and hearts. 
This address was followed by one by President L. C. Dickey, A. M., of Georgia, who 
spoke in opposition to public schools, free scholarships. and monumental institutions, 
which produced a lively interruption. Mrs. Louise Pollock, principal of the National 
Kindergarten and Normal Institute, Washington, D. C., ina brief address, presented the 
advantages of the Kindergarten teaching in the primary schools and called for the intro- 
duction of its methods in the primary departments of public schools. 
On report of the nominating committee, G. J. Orr, of Georgia, was elected presiden’ 
for the ensuing year; W. D. Henkle, of Ohio, secretary; and H. 8. Tarbell, of Indiana, 
treasurer. 
On the third day, the morning session of the general association was called to order 
by President Smart, and prayer was offered by Dr. L. L. Rogers, of Tennessee. John B. 
Peaslee, superintendent of public schools in Cincinnati, then read a paper on ‘‘Moral 
and literary training in the public schools,”’ in which he advocated the study of English 
literature as a distinct branch in the high schools and wanted classes to begin with the 
authors of to-day and go back to the older ones, instead of beginning with the early 
writers and coming down to the present day. He then called attention to some of the 
errors in our methods of teaching. One is in the amount of time given to arithmetic, 
which is more than all the other studies combined receive, while little time is given to 
literature and composition. Another mistake is the pernicious method of teaching his- 
tory, compelling the pupil to memorize page after page of dates and facts. Still another 
is crowding into the high school course much that belongs to the colleges and univer- 
sities. He believed that gems of literature, properly taught in schools, would elevate 
and make‘our hoys and girls grow up into better and nobler men and women. Dr. A. 
W. Calhoun, a distinguished oculist of Atlanta, Ga., then read a paper on ‘The effect 
of student life upon the eyesight,’’ in which he referred to the fact that it isin the 
school room that the larger and most important part of the child’s life is spent, and 
that, while the whole energy is bent upon the proper development of the brain, too little 
attention is given to the importance of a healthy eye, which, while itself is developing, 
undergoes great changes from the duties itis called on to perform. The near-sighted eyeis 
too long a balland is absolutely diseased, the extra convexity making its appearance rarely 
before the fifth or sixth year, which is about the time children begin to go to school. Itis

produced by overwork, and the elongation gradually but constantly increases through all 
the years of school life, even to the twentieth or twenty-fifth year. Nearsightedness in city 
schools is more frequent than in rural districts, owing to the better surroundings in the 
country, where there are less strain and more rest. Colored children are remarkably free 
from nearsightedness. Some instruction as to the kind of glasses to be used, the amount, 
direction, and color of light to be admitted into the school room, coneluded this address. 
After a spirited discussion of the two papers read on Tuesday and Wednesday, ‘‘ What 
shall we teach in our public schools ?”’ and ‘‘ The proposed revision of the common school 
curriculum,’’ a communication from the senate inviting the association to seats with that 
body in the senate chamber was received and read. 
In the evening Mrs. Pollock, of Washington, D. C., gave an exhibition of the Kinder- 
garten system and its working, which was much enjoyed; while at De Give’s Opera 
House Prof. Wm. I. Marshall, of Fitchburg, Mass., in an illustrated lecture, gave a de- 
scription of the great Yellowstone National Park. 
On the fourth day the general association listened to a paper by F. Louis Soldan, of 
St. Louis, on ‘‘ The century and the school,’’ a long and exceedingly interesting paper, 
of which only the central thought can be given. The century makes two distinct de- 
mandson schools. One is that the school shall be in harmony with the practical aims and 
spirit of the times; the other, that it shall help to guard those ethical interests which are 
as old as the human race itself, which alone constitute man a civilized being, and which 
make uprightness and charity a part of human nature. Hon. Joseph E. Brown, United 
States Senator from Georgia, was then introduced, and said: ‘‘ Asa citizenof Atlanta and 
Georgia, I take pleasure in uniting with what has been said by the governor of our State, 
as well as by our citizens whom you have heard, that you are cordially welcome to our 
State and city. Many of you come from the Northern and Western States. Weare proud 
to see you here on that account. The time was when we had differences. That time 
has passed. We are now one people again, and one people we shall remain forever. 
The cause of our struggle has been forever removed, and there is now no question that will 
divide the people in the future. Iam proud to know that this isso, and I shall do all I can 
to promote the interests of the whole nation, and especially the cause of education.” 
He then referred to the remarkable age in which,we live, especially in the progress of 
education; and, while he differed in politics from many of his brethren in the North, 
he said he was grateful for the educational doctrines they held, enunciated, and applied. 
He then spoke of the peculiar troubles of the South in this direction, saying that at the 
close of the war 4,000,000 people had been changed from slaves to freemen and that it is 
the interest, wish, and duty of the southern people to make them as good citizens as they 
can. But they had lost the value of them, $2,000,000,000. Two armies were supported 
on their territory. They were left poor, and must have aid. The Senate was a unit 
on this view of their need, and the outlook was hopeful. He sat down amid great-ap- 
plause, and a vote of thanks was tendered him for his address. 
Mr. Bicknell, chairman of the committee on resolutions, reported a preamble and two 
resolutions in reference to national aid, which were unanimously adopted. Mr. Bick- 
nell subsequently introduced a resolution heartily commending the arrangement to 
include in the proposed cotton exhibition at Atlanta a representation of education, and 
pledged the codperation of the association, which was adopted with much enthusiasm. 
Mr. William T. Harris, of St. Louis, then read a paper giving an account of his visit to” 
Brussels last August as the representative of the association at the International Educa- 
tional Congress; and a committee was appointed to prepare the way for a representation 
of education at the proposed International Exposition at Boston in 1885. John D. Phil- 
brick, Massachusetts; John Eaton, Washington; J. P. Wickersham, Pennsylvania ; H. 8. 
Thompson, South Carolina; A. J. Rickoff, Ohio; T. W. Bicknell, Massachusetts, and J. 
H. Smart, of Indiana, constitute the committee. The committee on resolutions reported 
a series of resolutions on wider reading of educational literature, on the need of universal 
education as vital to our institutions, on the necessity for normal schools to train teachers 
for the common schools, on the satisfaction with which the progress of free school train- 
ing in the South was witnessed, on the amount of good done by the National Bureau of 
Education in disseminating valuable educational information, and deploring the mortal

Thén, after a few remarks from the president elect, Dr. Orr, the association adjourned 
to meet next year at Saratoga.— (Journal of Education.) 
DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 
On the afternoon of the second day, the department of higher education met, and 
President Lemuel Moss, of Indiana, being in the chair, opened the meeting with an 
address, the leading thought of which was that all questions of human interest are. at 
bottom, questions of philosophy, and that no competent and honest teacher in this day 
and nation can be otherwise than serious and anxious concerning the philosophical con-

ceptions which are to dominate and direct the thought and life of the people. Presi- 
dent I. W. Andrews, of Marietta College, Ohio, followed with a paper on “The study 
of political science in colleges.’? Among the principal reasons given for this study was 
this, that the student would there lay the foundation of this knowledge without partisan 
bias. Dr. H. H. Tucker, of Atlanta, was then introduced and read an entertaining 
paper on ‘‘ The advancement of the higher education,’’ opening with the statement that 
prominent and influential men are not usually looked for among teachers and stating 
that the profession, even in its higher departments, involves elements which are apt to 
belittle the mind and character. Its sphere of thought is narrow. A teacher’s life is 
almost necessarily monastic. His business shuts him out of the world. A recluse 
never becomes great. Not having means to travel, he becomes provincial in habits of 
thought. Repeated stooping to inferior minds lowers his stature. Teachers should hold 
a higher rank, and be worthy of it. The style of this production was unique, its de- 
livery producing a high degree of enthusiasm. 
DEPARTMENT OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
At 3 P.M. of the third day the department of normal schools, Jerome Allen, of Gen- 
eseo, N. Y., president, proceeded to elect as its officers for the ensuing year C. C. Rounds, 
of Maine, president; T. C. H. Vance, of Kentucky, vice president; and Jerome Allen, of 
New York, secretary. After a short address from the president on the ‘‘ Necessity of a 
normal school in a public system of instruction,’”’ Prof. J. C. Gilchrist, president of the 
Iowa State Normal School, read a paper on ‘‘ What constitutes a normal school.’? He 
said the purpose of a normal school is the preparation of teachers for positions in the school 
system of the people; it must instruct in the sciences; must teach the science of the mind, 
the philosophy of education, the systems of instruction for all phases of school room 
work; must maintain a model or training department; must develop a professional spirit 
with that of noble manhood and womanhood in all its*pupils, uniting to all this true 
culture in goodness of heart and agreeableness of manners. He would have the normal 
school point out the sources of all moral knowledge, and would bring to bear on every 
pupil a moral power by which habits of the purest virtue will be inculcated, both by 
conscious and unconscious tuition. Mr. Vance, of Lexington, Ky., following with a pa- 
per on ‘‘The best normal training for country teachers,”’ severely criticised normal 
schools. Mr. DeWolf, State school commissioner of Ohio, to some extent agreed with 
him. Commissioner Orr, of Georgia, said that he was older than many present, but was 
young in this matter. The Atlanta University for colored pupils was the only college in 
Georgia that professed to be a normal school. The teachers turned out from normal 
schools are said to be far superior to any others, and he felt very deeply the importance 
of having in the State a normal school for the white and one for the colored teachers. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
met on the first day, with Hon. John M. Bloss in the chairas president. A carefully pre- 
peace paper on ‘‘The philosophy of illustration ’’ was read by Ex-State Commissioner 
J. J. Burns, of Ohio, and followed by another on ‘‘ The education of the sensibilities,” 
by Superintendent John W. Dowd, of Toledo, Ohio, in which he said that schools cannot 
give too much intellectual power, but they may give too little of refined sensibility. 
* School life touches character at every point. You can no more teach school without 
teaching morality than a mason can lay brick into a grand imposing structure without 
the aid of mortar. . 
The department, on reporgof its nominating committee, elected Superintendents J. M. 
Bloss, of Indiana, A. L. Rogéfs, of Louisiana, and J. J. Burns, of Ohio, as president, vice 
president, and secretary for the ensuing year. 
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
On Friday morning the department of industrial education was called to order by 
President E. E. White, of Indiana. The first business transacted was the election of 
C. O. Thompson, of Worcester, Mass., as president for the ensuing year; Henry H. Fick, 
of Cincinnati, Ohio, vice president; and S. R. Thompson, of Lincoln, Nebr., secretary; 
and a vote of thanks tothe retiring president. President White read a short address 
on the general objects of industrial education, which was a brief statement of the prin- 
ciples advocated in his address on “Technical education in public schools,’ given last 
year at Chautauqua. The secretary, S. R. Thompson, in his report, gave the names 
of the industrial schools established during the year, of new departments in schools 
already established, new and improved facilities for teaching manual arts in schools 
for deaf-mutes and the blind, as well as in reform schools, and the general drift of 
public opinion in regard to industrial training. Resolutions requesting the United 
States Commissioner of Education to publish certain documents on this subject and 
requesting the secretary to continue his investigations were adopted ; an excellent ad- 
dress, by Prof. L. S. Thompson, of Purdue University, on ‘‘The decay of apprentice-

ship—its causes and remedies,’”’ was then delivered, followed by an exhibition of some 
specimens of the work done by the students, illustrative of the course of study, especially 
in drawing, after which the department adjourned. 
ANNUAL MEETING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE. 
This body, made up of State and city superintendents and other educational officers 
from all parts of the country, held its annual meeting in the hall of the Cooper Union, 
New York, from Tuesday to Thursday, February 8-10, 1881. The attendance was large 
and the programme wellsustained. Theaddress of welcome was by Stephen A. Walker, 
president of the New York board of education. He referred to the educational charac- 
ter of the Cooper Institute and to the hall as ‘‘the cellar of oratory.’’? William T. Har- 
ris, LL. D., of St. Louis, then delivered an address on “‘The present aspect of public 
education in America and Europe.’’ 
Wednesday morning the meeting opened in the hall of the Young Men’s Christian As- 
sociation, with a paper on ‘‘The unification of school statisties,’” by Andrew McMillan, 
of Utica, N. Y., followed by addresses on ‘‘ Weak places in our systems of public educa- 
tion,’’ by Hon. J. P. Wickersham and Hon. B. G. Northrop; ‘‘The conservation of ped- 
agogic energy,’’ by Charles O. Thompson, of Worcester, Mass. ; and ‘‘Ourschools and our 
forests,’’ by Dr. F. B. Hough, of the Agricultural Department, Washington. Thursday’s 
session began with a paper by Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, of Brooklyn, N. Y., urging the in- 
troduction of scientific temperance teaching in schools and colleges, at the close of which 
Hon. John Eaton, Commissioner of Education, read a paper on ‘‘ Museums illustrative of 
education.’’ He was followed by Mrs. Walworth, a school commissioner of Saratoga, N. 
Y., who pressed the inquiry whether something could not be done by way of teaching a 
few of the elementary principles of morality in the schools, which gave rise to a long and 
inconclusive discussion. J. W. Patterson, State superintendent of New Hampshire, 
then read a paper on ‘‘ National aid to education,’’ the discussion of which finished the 
programme; and after the usual vote of thanks the meeting adjourned.— (Journal of 
Education.) 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
A council of education was created by the National Educational Association at its nine- 
teenth annual meeting at Chautauqua in July, 1880. The membership consists of 51 
persons who must belong to the parent association and be clearly identified with educa- 
tional work. Three members were elected by each of the five departments, the ele- 
mentary, higher, superintendents’, normal, and industrial; 12 were elected by the direc- 
tors of the association, and 24 others by the 27 thus elected. After the first year each 
of the departments is to elect 1 member biennially, the directors 2 annually, and the 
council 4 annually, the term of service being 6 years. 
This organization was seen to be necessary from the fact that the annual sessions of the 
National Educational Association were too short to allow of any final decision on many 
important questions presented. It was also considered that the work of the association 
would be greatly facilitated if subjects were brought before it in the matured form which 
the deliberations of a committee would give them. Committees representing the several 
departments of education are to be appointed by the council, and may be called on at 
any time for the consideration of educational questions and the expression of opinion, 
and each member must engage to serve on the committee to which he may be appointed. 
The regular annual meeting of the council is to be held two days before that of the asso- 
ciation and at the same place. An annual report must be made by the council to the 
association, setting forth the questions considered during year and the conclusions 
arrived at and embodying a survey of such topics as seem to call for action on the part 
of the association. 
The meeting of 1881 was held at Atlanta, July 19-21. After the arrangement by lot 
of the official terms of a portion of the members first elected and the transaction of other 
business, the reports of committees were submitted. Mr. E. E. White presented that on 
“Tndustrial education; ’? Mr. J. W. Wickersham, one on “‘Superintendency;’? Mr. W. 
T. Harris, one on “‘ Pedagogy in universities,”’ and Mr. Eaton, one on ‘‘ Hygiene.”’ It 
was agreed that all titles be omitted in reporting the minutes of the meetings of the 
council. The officers elected for the ensuing year were: T. W. Bicknell, president; 
James P. Wickersham, vice president; E. E. White, secretary; and Messrs. D. C. Gil- 
man, W. H. Ruffner, John Hancock, and J. L. Pickard, executive committee.—(Journal

NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS. 
This association, which holds two sessions during each year, met May 27 and again 
October 28, 1881, in Boston. 
The first session was in many respects a notable gathering, bothas to number of mem-

bers present and the interest and order of business. Only one general subject was before 
the convention, namely, ‘‘ Resolved, that superintendents, unbiassed by personal con- 
siderations or political and social influences, should recommend the dismissal of incom- 
petent teachers and the election of competent teachers only.’’ This was divided by 
the executive committee into a number of subheads and assigned to various speakers. 
Secretary Dickinson answered the question ‘‘ What constitutes a good teacher?’’? Dr. 
Philbrick, ‘‘How shall we get good teachers?” Superintendent Tash, of Portland, 
“‘How shall we keep good teachers?’’ Superintendent Aldrich, of Canton, ‘‘ How shall 
we help teachers in their schools?’’ Superintendents Lambert, of Malden, and Parish, 
of New Haven, ‘‘Should teachers disabled from age and long service be retained?’ 
Superintendent Marble, ‘‘How shall we get rid of the incompetent teacher ?’’ and Super- 
intendents Allard and Edgerly, ‘‘ What shall we do when teachers are retained by political 
and social influence?’’? The general question being then before the meeting it was dis- 
cussed by the superintendents named and a number of others, and was finally laid on 
the table, it being decided that in theory there could be no question as to a superintend- 
ent’s duty i in the matter. 
At the subsequent session 31 members were present, Hon. TB. Stockwell, of Rhode 
Island, in the chair. The first business was the report of a committee on Barnard’s 
‘American Journal of Education, Mr. Bicknell chairman. Superintendents were solicited 
to aid in placing 100 sets of this work in the public and teachers’ libraries of New Eng- 
land, and the responses from all present indicated a deep interest in the subject and 
willingness to assist. As on the previous session, the topics before the meeting were 
first discussed by members to whom they had been assigned and then by the association 
at large. Superintendent J. T. Prince answered the question ‘‘ What is the best method 
of developing the intellectual faculties??? Superintendent Brown, the kindred one, 
‘“What are the means to secure the best mental discipline ?”’ Superintendent J. Osgood 
treated of moral discipline; Superintendent G. C. Fisher, of physical development; and 
Superintendent Cogswell, of teaching and discipline. The last gave a résumé of the 
methods applied in Cambridge to ascertain the character of teaching and discipline. 
These included personal inspection, written examinations, and written reports from 
members of examining committees, the codperation of the committees being thus secured 
in the removal of incompetent teachers. Superintendent Parker suggested that, prior 
to the application of the tests, teachers be given an opportunity to teach according to 
their judgment. He said that they were often given work beyond the power of the 
children and of themselves. Supervisor Littlefield, of Boston, thought that to only ask 
teachers to do what they think they can would make district schools of all graded 
schools. He said a superintendent of schools is as necessary as an overseer of a mill or 
of slaves. He questioned the utility of discussing these and similar topics, and of all 
such investigations. He feared they might lead to general doubt of all educational 
truths (such doubts having been a result of inv estigation in the religious world), an 
besides, in his opinion, there is no educational science or system of principles. These 
remarks led to an animated discussion, in which many members joined, and after the 
election of officers for the ensuing year the meeting adjourned.— (Journal of Education.) 
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF INSTRUCTION.    
The tifty-second annual meeting of the American Institute of Instruction was held at 
St. Albans, Vermont, July 5-8, 1881, the president, William A. Mowry, of Providence, 
R. L., in the chair. 
The editor of the Journal of Education describes this meeting as eminently an educa- 
tional success. The news of President Garfield’s assassination came just in time to 
arrest the great throng that would have welcomed him to the first reception of a Presi- 
dent by an educational association in Northern New England. But the higher teachers 
came in large numbers, probably a full thousand. The audience room of the Congrega- 
tional Church was crowded to its utmost capacity,.and the interest seemed to increase up 
to the culminating point, in the great out-door meeting in the public park and the closing 
reception at the home of Hon. Worthington Smith, on Friday evening. 
The institute opened on Tuesday evening with an interesting and scholarly address 
from M. H. Buckham, president of the University of Vermont, on ‘‘The choice and use 
ot books,’’ after which several entertaining readings were given hy Prof. 8. S. Bloch, of 
Boston. 
The second day was given to a consideration of national aspects of education in the 
broadest sense. The address of welcome by Governor Farnham, of Vermont, an excel- 
lent practical talk, was followed by the president’s annual address. This commenced 
by saying that true education is wider than the schools, deeper than the curriculum of 
studies, and higher than childhood and youth, including, as it does, the school, the col- 
lege, the trades, industries, and professions. He thought that arithmetic received too

much attention in the common schools; that more time should be given to language an@ 
its study; and that the high school curriculum should embrace more political studies, 
including the balance of power between the State and the nation and the duties of 
American citizens. Superintendent J. W. Patterson, of New Hampshire, gave an address 
on ‘‘ Political education,’ in which various good reasons were given for making the study of 
politics universal. Inthe afternoon the audience listened for three hours, without showing 
signs of weariness, to the glowing word pictures of C. C. Coffin, of Boston, who spoke on 
‘The physical geography of our continent,’’ and to the fervid oratory of Dr. J. L. M. 
Curry, agent of the Peabody education fund, who made a stirring appeal for education. 
in the South. Mr. Coffin’s paper gave a most graphic description of the wonderful 
resources of our country, and showed the mighty influence it must exert in future ages. 
The address of Dr. Curry was the more valuable from the fact that his connection with 
the Peabody fund leads him into every part of the South to examine their educational 
interests and prepare the way for free schools. In the evening Dr. A. D. Mayo gave 
some of the results of his observations during the year in nine Southern States on the 
subject of education. On Thursday morning the institute listened to an address from 
President Greenough, of the Rhode Island Normal School, who outlined his ideal of the 
true educator. Professor Bloch, whose readings were one of the attractions of the entire 
session, discoursed on methods of elocutionary instruction; Professor Osbun, of the 
Salem (Mass. ) Normal School, illustrated his method of manufacturing and using appa- 
ratus for the teaching of nature knowledge in common schools; Ex-Superintendent 
Small, of Salem, Mass., presented the moral, social, and esthetic bearings of popular 
education in an address on ‘‘ Jesus Christ, the model teacher ;’? Mrs. Julia Ward Howe 
read one of her admirable essay lectures on ‘‘ The relation of education to our new social 
life ;’? and a lecture by Wallace Bruce on Sir Walter Scott closed the educational feature 
of the meeting. Friday morning was given chiefly to commemorative addresses on de- 
parted educators: George B. Emerson, of Massachusetts; David Crosby, of New Hamp- 
shire; and Nathan Bishop, of New York. A beautiful tribute, was paid to Mr. Emerson 
by General H. K. Oliver, now the only surviving member ofthe first board of management. 
of the institute. 
A mass meeting in the open air, held in the afternoon, wasa fitting close to the public 
exercises of this occasion. Mrs. Howe addressed the assembly on the grand mission of 
teachers; President Mowry read a poem composed for the occasion, which was then sung 
by the congregation; Rev. Charles Van Norden offered prayer, asking God to save the 
President; Mrs. Howe’s ‘‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’? was sung with great effect; 
President Mowry delivered an address alluding to President Garfield’s intention of being 
present at the institute, and the sad event which had prevented it; and after other 
short addresses and the singing of the doxology the institute adjourned.— (Journal of 
Education. ) 
AMERICAN SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION. 
The general object of this association is to promote the good of the community by the 
investigation of various social questions, including education, health, jurisprudence, and 
social economy. Itsannual meeting for 1881 was held at Saratoga, N. Y., September 6-9. 
The opening address by the president, Francis Wayland, of the Law School at New 
Haven, was an able presentation of the defects in our law-making system. At a meet- 
ing of the department of education, the chairman, Prof. W. T. Harris, of Concord, Mass., 
made a masterly’ extemporaneous address of an hour on education. While recognizing 
fully the vital importance of moral and religious training in early youth, he thought 
this should be attended to especially by parents and churches and that school education 
should be secular. A paper on the education of deaf-mutes was read by Dr. Edward Gal- 
laudet, president of the National Deaf-Mute College. He expressed the opinion that 
the sign language and lip reading should both be used, some pupils being most benefited 
by one method and some by the other, but claimed that the sign language had impor- 
tant advantages over articulation in the greater rapidity and certainty with which it 
can be used. Mr. Charles Dudley Warner read a paper on the American newspaper, 
which concluded with the opinion that the moral tone of the newspaper is generally 
higher than that of the community in which it is published. A discussion of the tem- 
perance question was one of the most interesting of thesession. Hon. P. Emory Aldrich 
advocated prohibition, presenting a solid and effective array of facts and figures, with the 
inevitable conclusions to be drawn from them. Dr. Leonard W. Bacon defended license 
and Hon. F. W. Bird argued for unrestricted traffic. Each presented a written paper, 
limited to half an hour. Dr. Bacon charged the comparative inefficiency of the license 
laws largely on prohibitionists, many of whom, he said, desired to have them fail, and 
were even willing to combine with liquor dealers to effect that end. Mr. Bird attempted 
to show that hoth license and prohibitory laws have proved a complete failure, neither

having reduced materially the consumption of liquors, and said that moral suasion 
is the only effective method of restricting the traffic. Each side was strongly presented, 
but the sympathy of the audience seemed to be decidedly in favor of prohibition. There 
wasa crowded house to listen to George W. Curtis, of New York, on ‘‘ Civil servicereform.”’ 
He gave a history of the civil service, showing that the reform he advocated would be 
simply a return to the principles and practice of early administrations. 
The subject of insanity occupied considerable time, and there seemed to be a general 
agreement that the women in asylums for the insane should be attended by women 
physicians; also, that patients should have individual treatment as far as possible. Hon. 
Dorman B. Eaton, in summing up the debate, said that, after all, very little is known 
yet about insanity or its causes, as to when it really exists, or even what is an accurate 
and comprehensive definition of it. Mr. F. B. Sanborn expressed the opinion that there 
are now not less than 100,000 insane people in the country. Dr. Emily Pope, of Boston, 
read a paper on the women physicians of the country, showing wide and careful research 
as to their number, circumstances, and success. She thought the number in practice 
was about 390 or more. Mr. Robert P. Porter, of the Census Bureau, read a paper 
showing that the present State, county, and municipal debts of the country amounted to 
about $1,055,308,000. General John Eaton, United States Commissioner of Education, 
spoke on education at the South, giving many facts of interest. Rev. 8. W. Dike read 
a paper on ‘‘ Divorce legislation,’ and many other topics of interest were presented. 
The attendance was not large, the house frequently not being more than a quarter filled; 
but most of the addresses will be printed, and will thus reach the public.— (Congrega- 
tionalist. ) 
     
  AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 
The thirteenth annual meeting of this society began in Cleveland, Ohio, July 12, 1881, 
with about 30 members in attendance. The papers and discussions of the first day em- 
braced ‘‘Homer and Strabo,’’ by Professor Egrihler, of Johns Hopkins University; 
‘Latin words in the Talmud,’’ by Prof. James 8. Blackwell, of the University of Mis- 
souri; and ‘‘The home of the original Semitic people,’’ by Professor Toy, of Harvard. 
In the evening Prof. Lewis R. Packard, of Yale College, delivered the annual address. 
On the second day the following papers were read: ‘‘ History of the ‘A’ vowel, from 
old Germanic to modern English,’’? by Dr. W. Weelsey, of the Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity; ‘‘ Verses of text respecting the precious stones of Scripture,’’ by Professor 
Blackwell, of the University of Missouri; ‘‘ Mixture in language,’’ by Prof. W. D. 
Whitney, of Yale College; ‘‘ Language of the Isle of Man,’’ by Mr. W. S. Kerruish, of 
Cleveland; ‘‘The use of abstract verbal nouns in Thucydides,’’ by Dr. E. G. Sihler, 
of New York; ‘‘The vowel scheme of Melville Bell,’’ by Prof. Samuel Porter, of the 
National Deaf-Mute College, Washington.— (Scientific American. ) 
NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF CHARITIES AND CORRECTION. 
The eighth national conference of this body was held in Boston July 25-30, 1881, there 
being present 214 delegates, from 16 States, the District of Columbia, and Canada. The 
objects aimed at by the society are: (1) to reduce vagrancy and pauperism and ascer- 
tain their true causes; (2) to prevent indiscriminate and duplicate giving; (3) to secure 
the community from imposture; (4) to see that all deserving cases of destitution are 
properly relieved; (5) to make employment the basis of relief; (6) to elevate the home 
life, health, and habits of the poor; and (7) to prevent children from growing up as 
paupers. 
The conference met, by invitation of the State authorities, in the representatives’ hall of 
the State House, and was opened by Governor Long, of Massachusetts, in a graceful and 
felicitous address of welcome. The president of the conference, F. B. Sanborn, esq., 
of Massachusetts, followed in the customary address, in which he considered ‘‘In- 
sanity in its relations to the state.” Two days were devoted to questions connected 
with the work of associated charity societies. A report by Dr. Charles Cadwalader, of 
Philadelphia, showed the codperation of societies in 16 cities of the United States and in 
about 78 cities in Great Britain, reports having been received from 9 European organiza- 
tions. Robert Treat Paine, jr., president of the society in Boston, gave an account of its 
workings there, and J. Guilford Smith, esq., secretary of the Buffalo society, gave a 
history of the work in that city, where, he said, they had virtually put an end to all street 
begging. Mrs. James T. Fields presented a paper on ‘‘The constitution and duties of a 
district conference,’’ in which she referred to the need of industrial training for the 
young and the necessity of teaching the poor how to become self supporting. Levi L. 
Barbour, esq., president of the society in Detroit, followed witha paper on the difference 
between pauperism and poverty, and the duty of suppressing vagrancy, street begging, 
and mendicancy; Mr. Seth Low, of the Brooklyn Bureau of Charities, read a paper on

public outdoor relief in the United States; Mr. George A. James, of Boston, gave an 
account of the “‘ provident wood yard’? of that city, an association to provide employ- 
ment for persons seeking relief; and Mrs. Charles R. Lowell, of the New York State board 
of charities, read a paper on ‘The considerations upon a better system of public charities 
and correction for cities,’’ in which was sketched a carefully considered plan for dividing 
the charities of every large city into three departments, one for the care of children, one 
for the care of public dependents, and one for the reduction of crime. 
Friday was given to the subject of ‘‘ Preventive work among children. It was to have 
been presented by Ex-Governor John J. Bagley, of Michigan, but news of his sudden 
death reached the conference by telegraph the morning of the day on which he was to 
speak. His place as chairman for the day was taken by Hon. W. P. Letchworth, 
ot New York, and after a report of local work in this direction in Vermont and Ilinois, 
by Mrs. H. M. Beveridge, of Illinois, Mrs. Elizabeth C. Putnam, of Boston, gave an 
account of “The work of auxiliary visitors among dependent and delinquent children.” 
These visitors are persons appointed by the State of Massachusetts to visit and care for 
the minor wards of the State. There are 60 such acting under the authority of the State 
board of health, lunacy, and charity, who are paid only their travelling expenses. They 
seek homes for children either in domestic work or by adoption, visit the family of the 
child and that to whose care it is proposed to confide him or her, keep constantly in- 
formed about the circumstances of the child, and report to the board. Mrs. Susan I. 
Lesley followed in a paper on “‘ Foundlings,’”? and much other interesting matter was 
presented on the subject of insanity, imbecility, immigration, crime, penalties, hospitals, 
asylums, and other topics, which may be found in the official report of the conference. 
After resolutions of sympathy with President and Mrs. Garfield, the conference ad-

CHAUTAUQUA TEACHERS’ RETREAT. 
This department of the Chautauqua movement proposes to benefit teachers by com- 
bining recreation and conversation on the philosophy of education and the methods by 
which it may be promoted. Some of the foremost educators of the country are inter- 
ested in the movement, and a large number of teachers from various parts of the Union 
received certificates of attendance during the two weeks term of 1880 and of 1879. 
The retreat for 1881 was advertised to open July 19 and close August 2.__Among the 
topics on the programme appear psychology and pedagogy, geography, Kindergarten, 
industrial education, the tonic sol-fa system, elocution, gymnastics, clay modelling, Eng- 
lish grammar and literature, and phonography. No further report of the session has been 
received.— (Teachers’ Guide.) 
AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION. 
A conference of the officers and workers of this association, which deals largely with 
education of Indians and freedmen, was held at Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn., 
December 26-27, 1881, to consider the educational work of the association in the South, 
with a view to its unity and efficiency. Many of the teachers present had been long in 
the service, thus bringing to the discussion the qualifications of experience and observa- 
tion in regard to the educational aptitudes of the colored race. It was considered neces- 
sary to provide for them more and better theological instruction; and to this end the 
association was asked to establish a theological seminary farther south, in addition to 
the department of Howard University, and to sustain the efficiency of the departments 
at Talladega College, Alabama, and Straight University, New Orleans, La. The review 
of the industrial departments was satisfactory. The farms at Tougaloo, Miss., and 
Talladega, Ala., furnish labor for the boys, and the boarding departments there, as also 
at Atlanta and Fisk Universities, give employment to the girls. These industrial de- 
partments do not pay pecuniarily, but they pay in healthy mental and moral stamina 
and in preparation for practical pursuits. Much time was given to the discussion of 
normal and preparatory schools and their relations to higher institutions. The most 
effective work for the colored race, it was felt, is in the normal and preparatory schools, 
where the wants of the masses are met and the foundations laid for more advanced 
study. The results of the conference in this respect are expected to be greater unity 
and efficiency in object lesson teaching, normal training, and practical business educa- 
tion, as well as in giving more thorough preparation to those who may enter the colleges. 
The meeting also furnished opportunity for a better acquaintance among officers and 
teachers of the association and for a more extended knowledge of the various interests 
in its care. A significant and encouraging fact was the presence of Dr. J. B. Lindsley, 
secretary of the ‘State board of education of Tennessee, and of State Superintendent 
Doak, both of whom expressed in the strongest terms their appreciation of the work the 
association was doing in the South.— ( American Mis onary.)

3, 1881. ‘ The subjects under discussion related mainly to medical practice and not to 
the elevation of standards in medical colleges or other educational topics. The question 
of admitting homeopathic students to the courses at regular schools, which has been a 
burning one for several years, after an animated and eloquent debate, was finally dis- 
posed of by a compromise. The homceopath is to be allowed an education, but not a 
diploma. Dr. J. J. Woodward, Assistant Surgeon-General, Washington, D. C., was 
chosen president of the association for 1881-82. 
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 
This association, starting in 1881, grew from a similar one, the Victoria Institute, in 
England, whose object is the creation and distribution of literature illustrating the rela- 
tions between science and religion. As many of its ablest papers were from this side of 
the Atlantic, it occurred to some of the Christian scholars of America that a similar or- 
ganization should be attempted in this country. 
The attempt was experimental, but largely successful. Rev. Dr. Deems, pastor of the 
Church of the Strangers, in New York, who had for years been a member of the British 
Institute, and Rev. Amory H. Bradford, pastor of the Congregational Church of Mont 
Clair, N. J., made an effort to ascertain whether 10 gentlemen could be found who would 
deliver a course of lectures in the line of the relations of science and religion. The re- 
sponse was such that a syllabus was madeout. William O. McDowell, esq., engaged to 
build a hall to be used for these lectures on a beautiful property of his called Warwick 
Woodlands, on the west side of Greenwood Lake, at a railroad terminus 40 miles from 
New York City; and having secured an encamping hotel he offered to pay the fees and 
expenses of the lecturers. The course was opened July 12, 1881, with a lecture by Dr. 
Deems on ‘The cry of conflict, ” followed on the 13th by one from President Porter, of 
Yale College, on ‘‘ What we mean by Christian philosophy;’’ on Thursday, the 14th, by 
Prof. Borden P. Bowne, of Boston University, on ‘‘Some difficulties of modern materi- 
alism;’’ on Friday, 15th, by Prof. Stephen Alexander, of Princeton, on the ‘‘ Origin and 
primitive state of man;”” on Saturday, 16th, by Prof. GA. Young; of Princeton, on “‘As- 
tronomical facts for philosophical thinkers.’? On Sunday a large gathering listened to a 
sermon from Rev. A. H. Bradford, of Mont Clair, N. J. On Monday, 18th, the course was 
resumed with a lecture by Prof. Alexander Winchell, of the University of Michigan, on 
“The philosophical consequences of evolution,’ followed on Tuesday, 19th, by Rev. 
Lyman Abbott, D. D., of New York City, on the ‘‘Foundations of Christian belief; ” on 
Wednesday, 20th, by Rev. J. H. McIlvaine, of Newark, N. J., on ‘Science and revela- 
tion;’’? Thursday, 2ist, by Prof. B. N. Martin, of the University of New*York, on ‘‘Re- 
cent. physical theories in their bearing on teleology; 2 and lastly, Friday, 22d, by Presi- 
dent John Bascom, of the University of Wisconsin, on ‘‘The gains and losses of faith 
by science.’’ 
On the 21st of July, while this course was in process, a meeting was held in the hall 
of philosophy, when the American Institute of Christian Philosophy was organized, 
a prospectus issued, and Rev. Charles F. Deems, D. D., LL. D., was elected provisional 
president, Rev. Amory H. Bradford, provisional secretary, and William O. McDowell, 
provisional treasurer. The first monthly meeting was held at Warwick Woodlands, 
August 28, 1881, and the following gentlemen were elected vice presidents: John Bas- 
com, LL. D., of Wisconsin; Hon. Kemp P. Battle, LL. D., of North Carolina; Rev. 
Bishop Charles Edward Cheney, of Illinois; and General G. W. Custis Lee, of Virginia. 
It was ordered that the future monthly meetings be held in the parlors of the Church 
of the Strangers, where the second and third monthly meetings were held, at the last of 
which the committee on by laws reported a system of laws, which was adopted.— 
(Christian Philosophy Quarterly, 1881.) 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. 
The thirtieth annual meeting of this association met in Cincinnati August 17, 1881. 
Prof. G. J. Brush, of the Yale Scientific School, in the chair. The venerable retiring 
president, Hon. Lewis H. Morgan, absent on account of sickness, took leave of the society 
in a touching letter. The meeting was a most important one, whether viewed in refer- 
ence to the numbers in attendance, the high standing of the members in their various 
specialties, or the bearing upon science and real life of the subjects discussed. The 
topics presented before the several sections were too numerous for special mention here; 
among them were the following, arranged according to a new schedule adopted at this

meeting: In the section of mathematics and astronomy, ‘‘ Method of determining the 
solar parallax from meridian observations of Mars at opposition,’’ by J. R. Eastman, of 
Washington, D. C.; ‘‘ Wave lengths of the principal lines of the solar spectrum,’’ by 
T. C. Mendenhall, of Columbus, Ohio, and a report from a committee of eminent astrono- 
mers on new standards of stellar magnitudes; in the section of physics, ‘Electricity, 
magnetism, gravitation, considered as manifestations of one force,’’ by S. S. Parsons, 
Lodi, Ohio; in the section of chemistry in its application to agriculture and the arts, 
““Coal dust as an element of danger in mining,’’ by H. C. Hovey, of New Haven, Conn.; 
“ Amylose,’’ ‘‘Mixed sugars,”’ and the ‘Composition and quality of American wines’’ 
received attention, as well as ‘‘The development of sugar in maize and sorghum,’’ the 
writers on the last two being Henry B. Parsons and Peter Collier, both of Washington, 
D. C.; in the section of mechanical science, ‘‘ Suggestions for improvement in the manu- 
facture of glass and new methods for the construction of large telescopic lenses’’ was 
presented by G. W. Holley, of Niagara Falls, New York; in the section of geology and 
geography, came ‘‘ On the cause of the arid climate of the western portion of the United 
States”? and ‘“‘ The excavation of the grand caiion of the Colorado River,’’ both by Capt. 
_C. E. Dutton, of Washington, D. C., and also ‘‘A short study of the features of the 
region of the lower Great Lakes during the great river age; or, Notes on the origin of the 
‘Great Lakes of North America,’’ by J. W. Spencer, of Windsor, Nova Scotia, and ‘‘ Evi- 
-dence from the drift of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, in support of the preglacial origin of 
the basins of Lakes Erie and Ontario,’’ by E. W. Claypole, of Yellow Springs, Ohio; in 
the section of biology, ‘‘ A contribution to the study of the bacterial organisms commonly 
found upon exposed mucous surfaces and in the alimentary canal of healthy individ- 
uals;’’ in the section of anthropology, a lengthy and learned paper on ‘‘The gesture 
.speech of man,’’ by Col. Garrick Mallery, U. Ss. A., with another on “‘ A lawgiver of the 
stone age,’’ by Horatio Hale, of Clinton, Canada, descriptive of the formation by Hia- 
watha of the great league of the Six Indian Nations of New York. 
Before the close of the session, action »was taken, with considerable decision, on the 
practice which it was ascertained was growing up of conferring the degrees of doctor of 
philosophy and doctor of science honoris causa, instead of as an earned reward for 
scientific work and high attainments in philosophic study. The revelations made, in 
the discussion on this point, of the lavish way in which degrees are given went far to 
show the need of repressive action in other directions than the two specifically referred 
‘to.— (Proceedings of the thirtieth meeting, 1881.)

Very encouraging. 
Harman goed Groene 
physical, mental, and moral natures. 
Habits of order, neatness, 
diligence, Perseverance, par tience, and kindness are 
formed, and the child be- 
comes more thoughtful, 
quiet, and gentle. Very beneficial to physical de- 
vélopment, being highly reo- ommended by physicians; also induces thought and gen- eral mental growth. 
The physical training is of 
great value, all the muscles 
of the body being brought 
into action, and the mental powers are gradually awa kened, without injury to the 
young mind. ‘Trains the hand, gives ease in movements of the body, 
makes the child quick to think, and on the alert for impressions ; and imparts to 
him aknowledgeofmanycom- mon things which he could not otherwise gain. 
    
Strengthens the body, awakens the powers of the mind, cul- tivating especially habits of observation and attention, 
and promoting harmonious development of the senses. 
Most beneficial in every way, 
strengthening and develop- 
ing without forcing. 
Children become strong and 
active,orderlyand observing; they learn toloveuseful wor! to be kind to one another, ant 
to strive to do that which is 
right.

It makes the child graceful, easy, and polite in his man- ners, quickens the intellect, 
especially developing the powers of observation and expression, and its moral ef- fect is incalculable, 
Promotes physical and mental 
development in a pleasant and effective manner, and 
forms athorough preparation for primary classes, Good. 
Wonderful; changing in a short time those who have never known rule or guid- ance to orderly children. Improves the physical condi- tion, awakens and expands the mental faculties, teaches the child to be systematic, thoughtful of others, self dependent, and polite, and lays a valuable foundation for later school work. Decidedly advantageous. 
  Very beneficial to both body and mind. 
Develops the muscular system, 
improves the health, quick- ens the perception, and arouses the mind to activity. It appeals at once to the men- tal and moral faculties of the 
child, making him familiar with the forms of usefulness 
and beanty around him, and cultivating in him a desire to 
investigate and create the same. Improved physical and ner- vous condition, habits of at- 
tention, observation and 
thoughtfulness, of sociabili- 
ty, Kindness, and cheerfal- ness; it is also a superior 
preparation for subsequent 
mathematical training.

FOREWORD 
Tuts volume is issued in response to numerous requests from all parts 
of the country for comparative data on the states. 
In the early days of the Inquiry great pains were taken to secure from 
prominent educators, and laymen interested in education throughout the 
country, specific suggestions as to what studies could be most profitably 
undertaken outside of New York. From personal conferences and cor- 
respondence it was soon clear that both educators and laymen urgently 
desired authoritative information on the cost of public education, so pre- 
sented as to permit comparisons between the states. 
To meet such need this study presents data on (1) the cost of education 
compared with the total cost of government; (2) the cost of education 
distributed among schools of different levels; (3) educational expenditures 
analyzed into capital outlay, interest, and current expenses; (4) sources 
of school revenue; and (5) the school debt. On each item the facts are 
given for the country as a whole, and for each state individually. In ad- 
dition, various devices have been employed to insure easy and accurate 
comparisons between the states. The significant facts about any one 
state are drawn together in a special table for that state. The tables reg- 
ularly include data for 1910, 1915, and 1920, and where possible for the 
years between. 
The difficulties encountered in securing and interpreting the data have 
been numerous and great. No complete compilation of state and local 
finances has been made in the United States since 1902. Recent esti- 
mates of the revenues and expenditures of all governmental jurisdictions 
have been, with one exception, for the country as a whole, with no esti- 
mates for individual states and little consideration of the nature of either 
revenues or expenditures. Educational revenues and expenditures are 
more carefully recorded than other public finances, but even these have 
not usually included the cost of state administration, school debt, and 
other items covered in this study. 
In view of the fragmentary nature of the records and the difficulties 
and possibilities of inaccuracy in interpreting such data as exist, the lack 
of information concerning public finances is not surprising. But it is a

lack which need not continue. The Educational Finance Inquiry Commis- 
sion believes that any attempt to bring together in comparable form such in- 
formation as is available, and to fill in the gaps with estimates based on such 
facts as are obtainable, is of sufficient value to justify this study, even though 
the possibility of error is large. Methods of estimating have varied, nec- 
essarily, with the nature of the material available. These have been 
described in notes accompanying the data. The results have been checked 
with other estimates where such are available. In the one case where 
comparison is possible for any considerable number of items (the state 
and local taxes for 1919 and 1920 in the Report of the National Industrial 
Conference Board on Taxation and National Income, No. 55) all impor- 
tant differences seem to be accounted for by differences in the fiscal year 
chosen. 
While this study was conducted under the general direction of the Educa- 
tional Finance Inquiry Commission, it was largely planned and carried 
through in its detail by Dr. Mabel Newcomer of the headquarters staff. 
Acknowledgments are also made to the many federal, state, and local fiscal 
officials, particularly in the State of New York, and to the Staff of the 
National Bureau of Economic Research, without whose generous aid this 
study would have been impossible. 
The Educational Finance Inquiry was initiated by a group interested in 
educational research which was brought together at the time of the meeting 
of the Department of Superintendence of the National Education Associa- 
tion at Atlantic City in February, 1921. This group designated the prob- 
lem of financing education as one of the most vital now confronting school 
administrators and appointed a committee to draw up a plan and to ask 
support for such an investigation. 
This committee met in New York in August, 1921, and formulated defi- 
nite proposals for the conduct of the Inquiry. Contributions were made 
by the Commonwealth Fund, the General Education Board, the Carnegie 
Corporation, and the Milbank Memorial Fund. The donors placed the 
money in the hands of the American Council on Education, who in turn 
appointed a Commission which was given full responsibility for the con- 
duct of the Inquiry. The names of those appointed on the Commission 
by the American Council on Education appear on another page.

  LIST OF TABLES 
The approximate location of any table may be easily found from the Table of Con- 
tents, and the exact location from the Index. 
Because of the large number of tables, and long titles, a conventional list of tables 
proved so unwieldy as to defeat its own purposes.

FINANCIAL STATISTICS OF PUBLIC 
EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES, 
1910-1920 
SUMMARY 
Note: This summary covers only ‘ public’ (“ tax-supported”’) education. 
Recent Increases in the Cost of Public Education. — The cost of public 
education in the United States, measured in actual dollars, increased much 
faster from 1910 to 1920 than in any preceding ten-year period since 1870.! 
This does not take into account the changing value of the dollar. 
Education’s Share of Governmental Expenditures. — In spite of its 
rapidly mounting cost, education is receiving a noticeably smaller propor- 
tion of total governmental expenditures than formerly. Thus the per- 
centage of total governmental expenditures devoted to education decreased 
from 17.6 per cent in 1910 to 11.8 per cent in 1920, or about one-third.” 
The percentage of national governmental expenditures devoted to educa- 
tion decreased from 1.3 per cent to 1.0 per cent, or about one-fourth. 
In the same period the percentage of state governmental expenditures 
devoted to education decreased one-fifth.2. Only in the case of total local 
governmental expenditures did the percentage for education increase 
and then only one-ninth.? 
The percentage of combined state and local expenditures going to 
education varies widely in the different states, and the range between the 
extreme states changes from time to time. Thus in both 1910 and 1920 the 
state with the highest percentage devoted nearly three times as great a per- 
centage of its total expenditures to education as the state with the lowest 
percentage. In 1915 the variation was nearly 4 to 1.2. When the states are 
grouped into the four geographical divisions and each group is measured 
by its median state, there are still important variations in this item. Also 
the relative position of the divisions changes in the different years.‘ 
The variations between the high and low states on per-capita state and 
local expenditures for all governmental purposes were practically the same 
for 1910 and 1920, the ratio of the extremes being about 8.5 to 1. On the 
corresponding educational per capitas, this variation was only about 6 to 1.° 
Costs of Education and of Highways Compared. — The best (because the 
largest) single item for comparison with the increasing educational costs is

the cost of highways. The costs of education and highways, although in- 
creasing rapidly in amounts, together comprised only 19.8 per cent of the 
total governmental budget in 1920, as against 28.6 per cent in 1910 and 
31.6 per cent in 1915.1. The cost for highways was increasing at a far 
greater rate than the cost for education. Of total state governmental ex- 
penditures, the percentage for education in 1920 had decreased to only 
four-fifths of what it had been in 1910, while the percentage for highways 
in 1920 had increased to five times what it was in 1910.1 Of total local 
governmental expenditures, the percentage for education increased about 
one-ninth from 1910 to 1920, while the percentage for highways increased 
only about one-thirtieth.! 
Of the per-capita governmental expenditures,” those for education and 
for highways in the country as a whole approximately doubled between 
1910 and 1920, as did also state expenditures for education, local expendi- 
tures for education, and local expenditures for highways. The per capitas 
for national expenditures for education and for highways, and for state 
expenditures for highways, increased at a much faster rate, the item for 
highways in both instances being far ahead of the corresponding item for 
education. ; 
Percentage of Income * Expended on Education. — Total governmental 
expenditures required half again as large a percentage of the total income 
of the entire country in 1920 as in 1910. State and local expenditures for 
all purposes required a perceptibly smaller percentage, total educational 
expenditures a slightly larger percentage, and state and local educational 
expenditures the same percentage of income in 1920 as in 1910.4 
The variations between individual states in the percentages of income 
devoted to governmental expenditures were, roughly, 4 to 1 for the extreme 
states in both 1920 and 1910,* as against a variation of a little over 4 to 1 
for education only in 1910, and 5.5 to 1 in 1920.° 
Educational Expenditures by Types of Schools. — From 1910 to 1920 
there was a marked change in the proportions of educational expenditures 
devoted to different types of education. For the country as a whole the 
proportion of total educational expenditures devoted to elementary and 
secondary schools is still large but decreasing.’ In the same period higher 
education made a noticeable gain and educational administration a slight 
gain, in their respective percentages.’ 
In percentage increases of total expenditures for elementary and second- 
ary schools from 1910 to 1920, the South, Middle West, and West ranged 
about the same, but the East was markedly lower.’ The latter’s standing 
is readily accounted for by the fact that the educational systems of the 
East were comparatively well developed at the beginning of this period.

SUMMARY 5 
In per-capita expenditures for education, the percentage increases for 
the different types of education ran from high to low as follows: Military 
and naval education and education of soldiers, educational administration, 
higher education, and elementary and secondary schools combined.! 
The variations between the extreme state per capitas for elementary and 
secondary schools in 1910 and 1920 were about the same, the ratio being 
roughly 6.5 to 1 in each case.? But the variation between the extreme 
states in per-capita expenditures for higher education was only about half 
in 1920 what it was in 1910.* 
Educational Expenditures for Capital Outlay, Interest, and Current 
Expenses. — Total educational expenditures of the entire country nearly 
doubled for capitaLoutlay, nearly trebled for interest, and increased about 
2.5 times for current expenses between 1910 and 1920.4 As a result capi- 
tal-outlay expenditures comprised a markedly smaller percentage of the 
total educational expenditures in 1920 than in 1910, while interest and 
current expenses had slightly increased percentages.* 
In percentage increases for current expenses in this period, the types of 
education ranked from high to low as follows: Military and naval educa- 
tion and education of soldiers, educational administration, normal schools 
and colleges, elementary and secondary schools, and Indian schools. For 
the same expenses the geographical divisions ranked West, South, Middle 
West, and East.” 
About the same variation occurred between the extreme states in the 
current expenses per capita in 1920 as in 1910, roughly 6 to 1.8 
Sources of Revenue for Education. — The support of public education 
comes primarily from local sources. Federal support of education has in- 
creased rapidly in recent years, the percentage of total revenues for educa- 
tion coming from federal taxes being 5.3 per cent in 1920, as against 2.5 
per cent in 1910.° However, the percentage of total federal taxes going to 
education decreased from 1.9 per cent in 1910 to 1.1 per cent in 1920.° 
State governments, in spite of increasing appropriations for higher educa- 
tion and increasing aid to local districts, are supplying a decreasing propor- 
tion of the total educational support. Local divisions supply more than 
70 per cent of the total revenues for all schools. 
Of the state revenues for education in the country at large nearly 80 per 
cent is derived from state tax revenues. By far the larger part of such tax 
revenues are obtained from general property taxes, although something 
less than half came from property tax revenues assigned to education.!! 
The permanent state school fund contributes little relief to the taxpayer in 
most states, and the proportion of state educational revenue from this 
source is steadily dropping for the country as a whole.” “All state revenues

for education in 1920 ranged from $.70 to $7.51 per capita with a median 
of $1.77, as against a range of $.28 to $3.15 and a median of $.82 in 1910.? 
The use of specific taxes versus appropriations from the general tax 
revenues for the state’s share in school support constitutes an important 
practical problem in educational finance. Meeting the appropriations 
from general revenues normally adjusts the amounts to needs, but a 
specific tax insures the educational institution or district a minimum on 
which it can absolutely depend.? These specific taxes are usually general 
property taxes. Specific general property taxes yielded 38 per cent of the 
state tax revenues assigned to educational purposes in 1910, and 48 per 
cent in 1920, while the contributions of the general property tax to the total 
state tax revenues decreased from 48 per cent in 1910 to 42 per cent in 1920. 
Of the local school revenues, 76 per cent came from the general property 
tax in 1920, as against 71.3 per cent in 1910.4 Local school taxes per capita 
ranged by states in 1920 from $1.72 to $17.64 with a median of $7.66, as 
against a range of $.33 to $6.89 with a median of $3.61 in 1910.° 
State educational subventions increased 87 per cent from 1910 to 1920, 
but the proportion of local school revenues received from them dropped 
from 19.0 per cent to 15.7 per cent.° There is a wide variation in the 
amounts of school revenue received from subventions in the different states. 
In 1910 the proportion varied from 2 per cent in Massachusetts to 74 per 
cent in Alabama. In 1920 the extremes were 3 per cent in Kansas and 44 
per cent in Mississippi.? By geographical divisions, in 1920 these state 
subventions formed the largest percentage of local school revenues in the 
South, with the West, East, and Middle West in the order given. Each 
division had an appreciably lower percentage than in 1910.8 
The best single measure of tax-paying ability is income and on this 
basis there was a large increase in total taxes between 1910 and 1920. 
This increase was in federal taxes, however, to meet the cost of the war. 
The percentage of income paid in state and local taxes was one-tenth of 
one per cent lower in 1920 than in 1910 and eight-tenths of one per cent 
lower than in 1915.° In seventeen widely scattered states and the District 
of Columbia the ratio of state and local taxes to income was actually lower 
in 1920 than in 1910. 
In 1920 the geographical divisions paid the following median percentages 
of their incomes in state and local taxes: West, 6.1, Middle West, 5.4, 
East, 4.9, South, 3.4." In the East this percentage was lower in 1920 
than in 1910, in the South and West about the same, and in the Middle 
West distinctly higher.!! Judged by income alone the western states might 
appear to be bearing about double the tax burden of the southern states. 
1 The “median” percentage is the “middle case” percentage. In other words, half the states have a 
percentage less than this and half have a larger percentage.

SUMMARY 7 
But the much lower per-capita income of the southern states ! means that 
the same percentage of income taken for taxes represents a greater sacri- 
fice there.? 
’ The School Debt. — Educational expenditures for the country as a whole 
each year exceed the educational revenues, leaving a deficit which was 3 per 
cent of these revenues in 1910, and 5 per cent in 1920.3 This annual deficit 
results in a small but steady increase in the educational debt. The increase 
in federal indebtedness for war purposes made the proportion of the total 
debt incurred for educational purposes smaller in 1920 than in 1910. The 
growth of state highway debts has reduced the relative importance of the 
state educational debt. But the increase in the local school debt has ex- 
ceeded the increase in local debts for all other purposes.* 
Of total state and local debts, the Middle West in 1920 had the highest 
median percentage incurred for education, followed in order by the West, 
South, and East.’ Every division had a much larger percentage in 1920 
than in 1910, except the East, which had a slightly higher percentage in 
1910.5 
The outstanding bonded indebtedness per capita of state and local 
governments, for all purposes and for education only, for the period 1910 
to 1920, was highest in the West, followed in order by East, Middle West, 
and South for all purposes, and in the order of Middle West, East, and South 
for education only.® In all divisions the amounts for both items in 1920 
were almost double those in 1910.° 
Large numbers of school districts are bonded to approximately the full 
value of their school property. The average ratio of such debt to school 
property, however, is well under 50 per cent, although rising rapidly.”. The 
median percentages by states was 17.1 in 1910, 21.6 in 1915, and 26.1 in 
1920.” 
The increasing importance of having the state control local borrowing, 
and limit more carefully the life of school bond issues and the powers of 
refunding,’ is indicated by the rapid increase of the school debt per capita. 
Additional reasons for such state control are such facts as these. In 
actual practice a temporary school debt can frequently be funded.’ And 
in most states it is possible for a school debt to remain outstanding after 
the school building for which it was incurred has become obsolete or has 
been destroyed.® ‘ 
Comparative Data on the Four Geographical Divisions. — Since there 
has been considerable demand for comparative data for educational finances 
in the different geographical sections, a Summary Table has been prepared. 
This table compares the four divisions on various items of governmental ex- 
penditures and debt, chiefly educational, for the years 1910, 1915, and 1920.

CHAPTER I 
THE COST OF EDUCATION COMPARED WITH THE TOTAL COST OF 
GOVERNMENT 
Tue cost of public education in the United States rose from five hundred 
million dollars in 1910 to seven hundred million dollars in 1915 and to one 
billion two hundred million dollars in 1920.1. The rate of increase during 
this period is greater than that of any ten-year period preceding it in the 
past 50 years,? but the significance of these growing expenditures can be 
properly evaluated only by comparing them with other governmental 
expenditures and with the nation’s income.   Pusiic ExpENDITURES FoR EpucaTION AND OTHER PURPOSES 
The three governmental functions making the largest demands on the 
public treasury (federal, state, and municipal combined) in 1920 were 
national defense, education, and highways. The cost of public service 
enterprises, mostly municipal, was also very large, but it did not equal the 
cost of any of these three. Moreover, expenditure for public service enter- 
prises represents a comparatively small demand on taxes, since these 
enterprises are in large part self-supporting. The costs of charities and 
corrections, general government, and protection of persons and property 
are all large and increasing, but none of these involves such large expend- 
itures as any of the three first-named functions, and in spite of the in- 
crease in their absolute cost the share of total expenditures applied to 
these purposes is decreasing.

1 ‘This sum is smaller than the sum of the totals of the separate national, state, and local expenditures by 
the amount of the federal and state subvention, which is included in both state and local divisions but is 
counted only once in the federal, state, and local total, and in the state and local total. 
2 This includes only national expenditures. Some expenditures for national defense have been incurred 
by state governments, but these are mostly small and scattering, and so have been included under “‘ all other 
expenditures” in this table. Most of the large expenditures for soldier bonuses have been incurred since 
1920. National defense includes all army and navy expenditures excepting for the military and naval acad- 
emies, the cost of fortifications, pensions, war risk insurance, care of soldiers, interest on war debts and 
special war activities. 
3 Subventions to states, Indian schools, military and naval academies, vocational education, and educa- 
tional administration. 
4 The reader should note that this 1920 item is mainly the cost of war paid in this year. The nearly four 
and three-quarters billions is not a typical peace footing yearly cost for national defense.

1 The proportion of taxes spent for national defense in these years was very much larger than the propor- 
tion of all governmental expenditures for this purpose, since the cost of national defense is met largely from 
taxes while many of the other functions are partially paid for by fees and other charges. 
2 Less than one-tenth of one per cent. 
3 This percentage is lower than either the state or local percentage for education owing to the fact that 
the amount of state educational subventions appears as a state expenditure and again, when disbursed by 
the local district, as a local expenditure, whereas it has been counted only once in the total state and local 
expenditure. 
‘This table and similar tables follow the usual practice of discarding decimals less than one-half of 
the last significant place. The practice, obviously, often makes a total only approximately 100 per cent, 
e.g. 99.9 per cent. 
  A large part of national expenditures is always for national defense, but 
the enormous war expenditure in the latter part of this decade greatly 
increased the proportion of national expenditure for this function as well 
as the total sum expended. In 1920, national expenditures had dropped
-P-A-G-E-22
14 FINANCIAL STATISTICS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
far below the high point of 1919, but they were still very large, and pre- 
dominantly for national defense. The costs of highways and education 
comprise an insignificant part of the national budget, although increasing 
rapidly in amount. 
The costs of education and highways combined account for nearly half 
(46.8 per cent in 1920) of all state and local expenditure. Education 
received more of the state and local funds than any other state or local 
function, although the rapid development of state highway systems during 
the ten years 1910 to 1920 absorbed an increasing proportion of state funds, 
and at the present rate of increase promises to exceed state educational 
expenditure in a very short time. 
In the local subdivisions the cost of education is greater than the cost of 
highways or any other function and is absorbing an increasing percentage 
of all local expenditures. Highway costs are growing more rapidly than 
all other costs combined, but not as rapidly as education costs. The state 
government is paying an increasing percentage of the cost of highways, 
but in spite of growing state school subventions the local districts are main- 
taining a steadily increasing percentage of the cost of education. 
The proportion of state and local expenditures for education varied in 
the different states from 16 per cent in Maryland to 45 per cent in Iowa in 
1920. This variation was even greater in 1915.

COSTS OF EDUCATION AND OF GOVERNMENT 4 
Highway expenditures exceeded school expenditures in nine states in 1920 
and the small proportion of expenditures for education in Maryland and 
Oregon is accounted for by heavy outlays for highways rather than by small 
expenditures for education. 
There is no marked variation in the percentage of expenditures going to 
various functions in the different geographical districts, although the pro- 
portion of both educational and highway costs is relatively high in the west 
and low in the south.

INcREASE IN EXPENDITURES 
The outstanding fact in any study of governmental expenditures is always 
the large increase in such expenditures. In the decade between 1910 and 
1920 both state and local expenditures considerably more than doubled, 
and the amount spent by federal, state, and local jurisdictions combined in 
1920 was between three and four times the amount spent in 1910. The 
cost of national defense consumed the largest part of this increase, but 
education and highways both shared liberally in the growing expenditures.

1 This increase is larger than either the state or the local increase because the amount of the state sub- 
vention subtracted in 1920 is a smaller percentage of the total expenditure than the amount subtracted in 
1910. 
There are wide variations in the rates of increase of both state and local 
expenditures in the different states during this period. In some instances 
the largest increase was for education, and in others for highways, and in 
a small mingrity of cases for other purposes.

Prr-Capita Costs 
It is easier to measure the burden of public expenditures when they have 
been reduced to a per-capita basis. In Table 11 are given the per-capita 
expenditures of the different jurisdictions for different functions. Through- 
out this volume “per-capita” items are figured on the basis of the total 
population of the various areas as given in the federal census. 
There is a marked difference in per-capita expenditures in the different 
sections of the country. In 1920 the per-capita cost of government in 
every state in the western section, excepting New Mexico, was greater than 
that in any southern state. Also the lowest per-capita expenditure of any 
state is in the heart of the south,— Alabama. And the state in each of 
the other geographic divisions with the lowest per-capita expenditures in 
that year is the state of that division situated nearest to Alabama. Other 
factors apparently affecting per-capita cost are the density of population 
and the percentage of urban population. States with a high percentage 
of urban population have, on the whole, relatively high costs, as in the case 
of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York in the eastern group, and 
Delaware and Maryland in the southern. States with a relatively sparse 
population, such as South Dakota in the middle-western group and Nevada 
in the western, also have a high per-capita cost. States with a population

1 This sum is smaller than the combined national, state, and local per-capita expenditures by the amount 
of the federal and state subventions. These have been included in separate national, state, and local figures, 
but subtracted from the total of the three to avoid double counting. 
2 Less than half of one cent. 
of medium density and a fairly evenly distributed population, e.g. Iowa, 
have a rather low per-capita cost. 
Per-capita expenditures for the individual states by rank occur in Tables 
12 and 13, and Diagram 3; and for the states by geographical divisions in 
Tables 14 and 15, and Diagram 2.

Per-capita expenditures are also greafly influenced by income and wealth. 
In general, the states with the higher per-capita incomes also have the 
higher per-capita governmental expenditures, and those with the lower 
per-capita incomes have, for the most part, the lower per-capita 
expenditures.!

ExprEnDITuRES ComMPARED WITH INCOME 
Increases in per-capita expenditures are no measure of increases in the 
burden of such expenditures, particularly during this period when the value 
of the dollar was depreciating so rapidly. A much better gauge of any 
changes in the burden of governmental expenditures is the ratio of such 
expenditures to the national income. There was a marked increase in this 
ratio between 1910 and 1920. The increase is entirely in federal expendi-

tures, however, and is the direct result of the war and the consequent in- 
creases in expenditures for national defense. When only state and local 
expenditures are considered, there is an actual decrease in the ratio of 
expenditure to income when 1920 is compared with either 1910 or 1915. 
In the states considered individually there is a decrease in the ratio for 
1920 as compared with 1915 in thirty-two states and in the District of 
Columbia. Those showing decreases in both periods include such impor- 
tant states as New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Ohio, 
and Illinois.! 
1 To obtain these figures the total national income for 1910 and 1915 as estimated in National Bureau of 
Economic Research, “Income in the United States,” vol. 1, p. 64, and the best obtainable estimate for 
national income for 1920 were distributed to the individual states on the basis of the proportion of the total 
national income derived in each state in 1919 (Knauth, O. W., “ Distribution of Income by States in 1919,” 
National Bureau of Economic Research, vol. 3, pp. 25-26). This has probably led to some inaccuracies, 
particularly in the earlier years, but such checks as are available indicate a fairly close approximation to this 
distribution.

The same changes which are apparent in total expenditures are to be 
found also in expenditures for education. Both the arithmetic mean and 
the median of the ratios of state and local educational expenditure to income 
were higher in 1915 than in 1910, and lower in 1920 than in 1915. Consider- 
ing individual states, thirty-six states and the District of Columbia show a 
lower ratio of educational expenditure to income in 1920 than in 1915, and 
sixteen states and the District of Columbia have a lower ratio in 1920 than 
in 1910. There is no marked change in this ratio when 1910 and 1920 
alone are considered.

In making these comparisons of the cost of government with the national 
income it is important to keep in mind the fact that in 1920 the national 
income was very high. It dropped from $72,500,000,000 in 1920 to 
$55,000,000,000 in 1921, and rose only to $59,000,000,000 in 1922.1. Mean- 
while the cost of education and all of the costs of state and local government: 
have apparently continued to increase. In the State of New York the cost 
of public education rose from $117,344,153 in 1920 to $175,480,003 in 1921 
and $196,034,409 in 1922, and the ratio of such expenditure to income in 
New York rose accordingly from 1.2 per cent in 1920 to 2.4 per cent in 1921 
and 2.5 per cent in 1922. It has been estimated that the cost of state 
school expenditures in thirty states rose 46.8 per cent between 1920 and 
1922.2, The expenditure included in this estimate is approximately two- 
thirds of the educational expenditure of 1920. If this rate of increase may 
be assumed for all such expenditures, then the state and local cost of educa- 
tion in 1922 was about $1,720,000,000 and the ratio of such expenditure to 
income was 2.9 per cent as compared with 1.6 per cent in both 1910 and 
1920. There are no satisfactory estimates of total governmental costs in 
1922, but state and local expenditures for the United States as a whole have 
been estimated to have increased nearly 20 per cent in 1921 over 1920.* 
It is impossible to make any exact comparisons between these estimates 
and the estimates in this study,* but the combination of rising governmental 
expenditures and falling income must have resulted in a marked change 
in the ratio between the two. These are only state and local costs, how- 
ever. Federal expenditures have dropped much more than state and local 
1 According to the best available estimates.

? From data in National Industrial Conference Board: ‘ Taxation and the National Income,” Research 
Report No. 55. October, 1922, p. 14. 
4 The former are for the fiscal year ending June 30, and the latter are for the calendar year ending Decem- 
ber 31. This difference alone is sufficient to account for the fact that the National Industrial Conference 
Board figure for 1920 is 11 per cent less than that in this report.

expenditures have increased, and while the ratio of total governmental 
costs to income rose in 1921 to 17.0 per cent, it probably dropped in 1922 
below the 1920 ratio because of the recovery of the national income figure 
and the further decrease in federal expenditures.! 
1 It is unfortunate that there is no satisfactory recent estimate of taxable wealth. Wealth fluctuates 
with income, but not to the same extent; and while it is not as satisfactory a measure, on the whole, as 
income, it is a more stable measure and is in itself an important indication of the ability of the nation to support government functions. The ratio of governmental expenditures to the total wealth (taxable and 
exempt) in the United States according to the estimate in W. I. King, ‘‘ Net Volume of Saving in the United 
States,” Journal of the American Statistical Association, September, 1922, is given below.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE COST OF EDUCATION AMONG ELEMENTARY 
AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, HIGHER EDUCATION, AND 
ADMINISTRATION 
Pustic education is still predominantly elementary and secondary school 
education, and in spite of the recent phenomenal development of state 
universities and colleges, and the large sums spent by the national govern- 
ment for the vocational rehabilitation of soldiers, 86 per cent of all educa- 
tional expenditures in 1920 were for elementary and secondary schools.

_ } This includes all military and naval education and the sum spent for vocational rehabilitation of 
soldiers. 2 Includes educational expenditures for natives of Alaska. 
8 This includes the administrative expenses of the United States Government, the state departments of 
public instruction and county superintendents, and such other state and local administration as is outside 
of the school district or institution. The internal administrative expenses of districts and institutions are 
included under elementary and secondary school and normal and college expenditure. The expenses of 
state boards of land commissioners have not been included, although their chief duties are to administer 
school lands, for the reason that they often have jurisdiction over lands not belonging to schools. 
4 The amount of the Smith-Hughes fund which the states have redistributed to local districts for elemen- 
tary and secondary schools is not always reported, but it has been estimated, on the basis of such figures 
as are available, that approximately $500,000 was so redistributed in 1920, and this sum is included here.

PERCENTAGE DIsTRIBUTION OF EpucATIONAL EXPENDITURES 
The percentage of educational expenditures paid out for general admin- 
istration, elementary and secondary schools, and other education is shifting 
somewhat, there being a distinct increase in the proportion going to higher 
education and to the education of soldiers, and a corresponding decrease 
in the proportion going to elementary and secondary schools and to Indian 
schools.

PRopoRTION OF EpucATIONAL EXPENDITURES FoR STaTE ADMINISTRATION 
One of the most variable of educational expenditures in the different 
states is that for state administration. This is largely because of the wide 
variations in the functions of the state administrative officers in the dif- 
ferent states. The fact that some states are incurring less than 1 per cent, 
and that others are incurring nearly 10 per cent, of their educational expend-

itures for this purpose, does not mean that the latter are spending that 
amount more for the same function.

1 The high percentage for New York in 1910 is accounted for by large capital outlays for the education 
building in Albany. 
The figures for local school administration also show wide variation and 
a rapid increase, but it has not always been possible to segregate these 
expenditures from the other local school expenditures, and the figures are 
not sufficiently complete to draw any conclusion from them.

IncREASE IN ELEMENTARY AND SEcoNDARY ScHooL EXPENDITURES 
The larger increases in elementary and secondary school expenditures be- 
tween 1910 and 1920 are not confined to any particular areas of the United 
States, although Connecticut alone of the eastern group is included in that 
half of the states with the greater increases. This is readily accounted for 
by the fact that the educational systems in the east were comparatively 
well-developed at the beginning of this period.

CHAPTER III 
EDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY, INTEREST, AND 
CURRENT EXPENSES 
No attempt has been made to classify educational expenditures according 
to the nature of the expense further than to eliminate all non-governmental 
cost payments! and to subdivide the net cost remaining into capital outlay, 
interest, and current expenses. The relative decrease in capital outlay is 
a reflection of the check on building resulting from war conditions.

CHAPTER IV 
SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 
A comparison of educational revenues with all public revenues reveals 
much the same tendencies as appear in a comparison of public expenditures 
for education and for other purposes. The state governments contribute 
a larger proportion of their taxes to education than do the local divisions, 
but the proportion of state taxes going to education is steadily decreasing, 
while the proportion of local taxes spent for school purposes is increasing.

Division oF Support or EpucatioN AMONG FEDERAL, STATE, AND 
Locat Divisions 
The support of public education comes primarily from local sources. 
Federal support has increased rapidly in recent years, but federal revenues 
comprised only 5.3 per cent of all school revenues in 1920; and two-thirds 
of these federal revenues went to military and naval education and voca- 
tional rehabilitation of soldiers, which activities had expanded greatly with 
the war. If only civilian education is considered, the federal government 
contributed less than 2 per cent of all school revenues, and a slightly smaller 
proportion of the whole than was contributed in 1910.1 State governments, 
in spite of increasing appropriations for higher education and increasing 
aids to local districts, are supplying a decreasing proportion of the total 
of educational funds, whether all education is considered or only civilian.

The federal government has not set aside any specific revenues for.edu- 
cation excepting under the Morrill Land Grant Act and the National Forest 
Fund Act. Fees collected in the course. of administering- educational 
activities yield a negligible sum, and the largest part of the federal educa- 
tional appropriations is met from the general tax revenues. 
State SourcEs 
State governments, however, usually obtain a part, and frequently a 
large part, of their educational revenues from sources definitely assigned 
to the schools. The proportionate parts of state school revenues yielded by 
different sources are indicated in Table 37 and Diagram 4. 
_ Income of Permanent Funds. — Most states have at least one permanent 
education fund which represents actual investments and from which a 
considerable sum is derived each year in the form of interest. Most of 
these funds have been built up largely from the proceeds of the sale of 
school lands and the principal of many of them is growing annually through 
additions from this source. Some of them represent the revenue loaned to 
the states from the national surplus in 1837. Many of them have been 
and still are increased from such minor sources of revenue as fines, forfeits, 
and escheats, and by adding to the principal each year all or a part of the 
1 Counties are included with other local divisions in this study.

interest of the fund, and also, more rarely, from appropriations from the 
general tax revenue.! The principal of those permanent education funds 
administered by the state increased from $304,321,039 in 1910 to 
$416,357,392 in 1920.? 
The interest obtained from these funds during the same period increased 
from $13,303,207 in 1910 to $23,647,960 in 1920. This increase is greater 
than the increase in the principal, representing about a 53 per cent return 
in the latter year as against a 43 per cent return in 1910.3 In spite of this 
increase in principal and interest the permanent school fund contributes 
little material relief to the taxpayer in most states. The proportion of 
state educational revenue from this source dropped from 10.6 per cent in 
1910 to 8.4 per cent in 1920, and the percentage of all educational revenue 
fell from 2.8 to 2.0. 
The typical school fund is invested in public bonds, — usually state and 
municipal bonds of the state owning the fund. Thus the interest received 
on the fund comes ultimately from taxpayers within the state and is re- 
distributed to them for the support of public education. In so far as the 
school fund is invested in municipal bonds and the districts issuing the bonds 
receive subventions from the fund, such districts are obtaining, in effect, a 
loan without interest, i.e. the interest which the municipalities pay on their 
bonds forms the income of the school fund which is returned to them in the 
form of a school subvention. Usually, however, there is a large amount 
of redistribution, and the benefit to the taxpayers comes, on the one hand, 
from the ease of floating state and local securities and the comparatively 
low rate of interest on these, — to the extent that they are purchased by 
the state; and, on the other hand, from the direct relief in school taxes 
afforded by the revenue from these funds. Taken asa whole, the revenue 
from permanent funds is small and the sources of increase of the principal 
(and consequently the interest) of these funds are for the most part few 
and unimportant. In most states the larger part of the school lands has 
been disposed of 4 and other sources are negligible. Moreover, the rate 
1 Cf. Appendix F, Table V, p. 146. 
2 This represents the value of actual investments of elementary and secondary school funds and those 
of the state institutions of higher education. It is very difficult to draw a line between funds which represent 
actual investment and purely fictitious funds. Where the fund exists only as a book credit it is clearly 
fictitious, and where it is invested in the bonds of other governmental jurisdictions or private corporations 
it is equally clearly a real investment. Many funds, however, are invested partly or wholly in the bonds 
of the state holding the fund, and in some cases these bonds are perpetual. It is reasonably safe to assume 
that where bonds are perpetual the principal has been dissipated long since and the fund is as fictitious as 
the strictly book credit ; but owing to the difficulty in ascertaining the exact status of such funds all of those 
represented by bonds, even irredeemable state bonds, have been included in the value of permanent funds 
in this study, and only the value of land (which is always doubtful) and the book credits have been ex- 
cluded. In dealing with the income of permanent funds that which is paid directly from state taxes has 
been included in general state taxes instead of with the income of permanent funds. (For principal and 
income of the funds of the individual states see Appendix E, Tables IV and IV A, pp. 143 ff.) 
3 This increased rate is perhaps in part an apparent increase resulting from better classification of accounts 
in the latter year, but probably it is due largely to the increased interest rate. 
4 According to the Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Education, “ Statistics of State School Systems,
-P-A-G-E-61

of interest in 1920 was high. Consequently there probably will be no 
material increase in the income of most of these funds in the future, and if 
the present rate of increase of educational expenditures continues, the 
revenues of the permanent funds, which at one time were expected to meet 
the bulk of the costs of public education, will shortly sink into insignificance 
in most of the states. 
Considering individual states, however, the revenue from the permanent 
school funds is still frequently important, — in some few cases supplying 
the larger part of the state educational funds and between 10 and 20 per 
cent of all educational funds, state and local, expended within the state.

As is to be expected the permanent fund plays no important part in school 
financing in the eastern states, which had no opportunity to profit from the 
national land grants. Massachusetts, after deliberately building up a 
permanent fund from tax revenues, receives only six-tenths of one per cent 
of her school funds from this source. In the south it is only the south- 
western states, e.g. Texas and Oklahoma, that are receiving large sums 
from this source. The funds of the western states are no larger than those 
of the middle west, but the smaller expenditure in the far west gives the 
income of these funds a relatively greater importance. It should be noted 
1919-20,” the value of unsold school lands is approximately $575,000,000. ‘This is a sum greater than the value of all invested funds. The large amounts, however, are confined to a few states, — more than 
$550,000,000 of the sum being in twelve states and nearly half in three.

54 FINANCIAL STATISTICS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
that those funds which are locally administered are not included in this 
table, and this makes the revenue from this source unduly small in a few 
cases. 
Miscellaneous State Sources. — The amount of the federal subvention 
paid to state officers and state institutions was approximately two-thirds 
of the amount of revenue received from state permanent school funds in 
1920,1 and there were miscellaneous sources of state revenue set apart for 
educational purposes in this year which slightly exceeded in amount? the 
revenue of the permanent fund. These miscellaneous revenues come 
largely from fees collected by the state educational institutions, although 
they include, also, gifts, fines and forfeits, rents and leases of school land, 
and other revenue collected in the course of educational administration. 
State Taxes. — Approximately four-fifths of state educational revenue 
comes from state taxes. This proportion has not changed appreciably 
during the ten-year period studied.* The policy of the different states with 
respect to meeting the cost of educational institutions and of subventions 
to the local district varies widely. In exceptional cases the amount of the 
subventions is determined wholly, or in large part, by the income from the 
permanent school fund, but usually the largest part of the subvention, as 
well as the cost of normal schools and colleges ® and the state department of 
education, comes from the tax revenue. 
The Use of Specific Taxes vs. Appropriations from the General Tax 
Revenues. — These expenditures from the tax revenue can be met in two 
ways, — by making the necessary appropriations from the general state 
revenues, or by setting aside all or a part of the revenues from specific taxes 
for this purpose. When the appropriations are met from the general 
revenues, the amount is normally adjusted to educational needs. In one 
case (Tennessee), however, the amount of the appropriation is determined 
by the amount of state revenues, since one-third of gross state revenues 
is set aside for education. When educational costs are met from specific 
taxes, there is not always the same close adjustment between needs and 
funds. In some cases the entire proceeds of some tax, e.g. the severance 
tax in Louisiana, is devoted to a specific educational institution; or a 
fixed rate, as in the case of a large number of states, is levied on general 
property.

state educational revenue. Table 37.

477.4 per cent in 1920 if federal subventions are included in state revenues. If only the revenues col- 
lected by the state government are included, this rises to 82.0 per cent. Cf. Table 37. 
5 In 1910 the percentage of state taxes is .6 per cent higher than in 1920 if federal subventions are in- 
cluded, and .6 per cent lower if these are excluded, Cf. Table 37. 
6 There is a decided tendency to increase fees and tuition in state educational institutions, but the per- centage of revenues from this source was approximately the same (9 per cent) in the two years 1910 and 1920.

property taxes. In some cases states which have practically discarded the 
general property tax for all other state purposes have retained it for the 
maintenance of state educational institutions or for educational subven- 
tions. In consequence, where the proportion of the total state tax revenues 
which was derived from general property declined from 48 per cent in 1910 
to 42 per cent in 1920, the proportion of state taxes spent for education 
which was derived from general property, rose from 38 per cent in 1910 to 
48 per cent in 1920. Furthermore, it should be noted that these last two 
percentages represent only such school taxes as came specifically from 
this source. In so far as the general tax revenues of the states come from 
the property tax, all of those educational appropriations paid from the 
general tax revenues are also paid from property tax revenues. The fact 
that the property tax is the largest elastic source of revenue, and that, 
further, the growing state subventions are in large part for the purpose of 
redistributing the burden of the school tax, probably accounts for this in- 
creased dependence on the state property tax for school purposes. 
The desirability of retaining the property tax as a part of the state 
revenue system is open to question, but bears no relation to the problem of 
educational revenue, excepting in so far as giving up the state property 
tax might lead to some cutting down of state educational expenditures. 
The practice of levying a fixed rate on property for educational purposes is, 
however, an important part of the problem of educational finance. 
The advantage of labeling and setting aside for education a specific 
portion of the property tax, or some other tax, is that it gives the district 
or educational institution a minimum on which it can depend, while still 
making it possible to increase this minimum through specific appropria- 
tions. The disadvantage is that it interferes with the best adjustment of 
the budget. Where the proceeds of these taxes are relatively small and 
are supplemented, to the extent required, by appropriations from the general 
tax revenues, there is no serious objection to them, — but also there is no 
important gain. Where the income of the institutions or the local districts 
is determined by the yield of this source there is very great danger either 
of checking an altogether desirable development through insufficient funds, 
or of encouraging unnecessary and possibly extravagant expenditure of 
money which could be used to better advantage for other state activities. 
Often the practice of thus setting aside specific sources of revenue for educa- 
tion is little more than a gesture. And if it does act as a check on educa- 
tional activity or encourage extravagant expenditures, it is thoroughly 
vicious. The fluctuations of income resulting from changing industrial 
conditions can have only a very indirect relation to the development of 
educational needs. And it is most desirable that the state’s financial 
system should be administered as a unit. It is of the greatest importance

that each source of revenue should be considered in relation to each other 
source, and that the different state activities should at all times be in 
such active competition one with another that expenditures may be re-

adjusted continuously to meet the most important needs. And if, in con- 
sequence, the voter and the legislator should judge highways to be of 
greater importance than schools or permit the cost of such highways or the 
cost of national defense to encroach unduly, in the opinion of the educator, 
on expenditures for education, it will be necessary for the educator to make 
an even greater effort to bring the general public to his point of view. 
Loca Sourcrs 
Most educational revenues come from the counties and. local districts, 
and most of the revenues of these local districts come from the local school 
tax on general property, although the state subvention furnishes substantial 
aid. The proportions of local school revenues obtained from the chief 
sources are given in Table 40 and Diagram 4A. Local school finances, 
outside of some cities, normally are administered independently of other 
local finances, and the school tax, consequently, is usually a distinct levy 
even when it is levied and collected with the other property taxes. 
Amount and Burden of Property Taxes. — The school tax furnishes the 
most elastic element in the educational revenues of the local districts and 
in consequence it has been used to supply a steadily increasing proportion 
of local school funds. The increase in the property tax for schools was 
slightly greater in the ten years 1910 to 1920 than the increase in local 
property taxes for all purposes, and the percentage of such local taxes defi- 
nitely assigned to schools rose from 29.0 per cent in 1910 to 31.4 per cent 
in 1920.

resent all local taxes collected for the use of elementary and secondary schools. The percentage is the 
proportion of all revenues for elementary and secondary schools obtained from the local taxes. 
2 These figures are local property taxes for educational purposes. (Cf. Table 40, p. 57.) The difference 
between this figure for 1910 and the figure from the Report of the United States Commissioner of Education 
for the same year is accounted for by the fact that the latter includes some local taxes other than the property 
tax, and that the educational functions included are slightly different in the two cases.

60 FINANCIAL STATISTICS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
To what extent this increasing school tax represents an increasing burden 
on the taxpayer it is impossible to say.1_ The real problem of the property 
tax is not the gross burden, but the inequalities in the distribution of that 
burden. This is a more serious problem in the case of school taxes than 
other taxes because of the relatively small size of the typical school district, 
and the fact that school expenditures are usually the largest part of govern- 
mental costs in the poorer districts. There is no very close relationship 
between taxable wealth and governmental costs, and the smaller the district 
the more marked the variation becomes. It is in part to meet this difficulty 
that the states have been increasing school subventions. 
Subventions — Amount and Distribution. — State adueaieounl subven- 
tions amounted to nearly $155,000,000 ? in 1920; but in spite of an increase 
of 87 per cent in these revenues during the ten years 1910 to 1920 school 
revenues from other sources outstripped them, and the proportion of local 
educational revenues received from the state dropped from 19.0 per cent 
to 15.7 per cent. This is a very substantial sum, however, and would help 
to equalize the burden if distributed solely for this purpose.’ The aim of 
state subventions, however, is probably fully as often to stimulate local 
educational development along certain prescribed lines as to equalize the 
burden of local taxes ; and even when the latter purpose is the primary one, 
the base chosen is usually the number of teachers or children or some other 
rough measure of cost. Only in a small number of instances is the value 
of property considered, and even more rarely is the relation of such values 
to the educational needs used as a basis of distributing state funds. 
No attempt has been made in this study to make a detailed analysis of 
the complex methods of apportionment in use in the different states, and 
1 It is not even possible to obtain the ratio of taxes to the true value of taxable property, owing to the lack 
of any satisfactory estimates of such property. A comparison can be made, however, with the estimates 
of total wealth, taxable and exempt, for the years 1909 to 1919, made by W. I. King (“The Net Volume of 
Saving in the United States,” Journal of the American Statistical Association, September, 1922). Ac- 
cording to these the increase in wealth in the United States during this period was 73 per cent. During 
the same period the increase in tangible wealth, which is the only wealth on which the general property tax 
is normally levied at the present time, was only 43 per cent. Between 1910 and 1920 all local property 
taxes increased 123 per cent and local school taxes increased 143 per cent. Meanwhile the base of the 
property tax has been steadily narrowed by the exemption of various classes of personalty, and even some 
real estate. Obviously, then, the owner of taxable real estate is paying an increasing proportion of its value 
in school taxes. Whether or not the burden is unduly heavy is another problem. 
All property taxes, state and local, amounted in 1920 to nine-tenths of 1 per cent of all wealth, and 1.3 
per cent of all tangible wealth, which in practice is the only wealth taxed. Since a large amount of even 
this tangible property is exempted from the tax, that property actually taxed must be paying on the average 
at least 1} per cent on true value, — or the equivalent of a 25 per cent tax onincome. The local school tax 
alone amounted in 1920 to nearly four-tenths of 1 per cent. This is a heavy burden, although not so heavy 
as it appears, since a large share of that part of the tax which falls on land doubtless has been capitalized 
long since. Moreover, the monopoly element in the ownership of land makes it possible to tax land more 
heavily than other property, and the fact that land values continue to increase, even in the face of rising 
interest rates, is evidence that the income of land is increasing more rapidly than the taxes. 
* 2 This includes such small sums from the federal government as were redistributed to the local govern- 
ments in this year.

the amounts of revenue apportioned according to each base; but the bases 
in use in January, 1922, for the apportionment of all of the more important 
state and county subventions have been roughly classified in Tables VIII 
and IX (pp. 163, 171). 
It is clear from this table that the largest part of the state funds is dis- 
tributed according to school children or teachers. This is a rough measure 
of cost, but, unfortunately, taxable wealth is not distributed in proportion 
to children to be educated. This has been adequately demonstrated by 
the detailed study of conditions in New York ! as well as in less extensive 
studies made in other states. 
There is a wide variation in the amount of school revenue received from 
subventions in the different states. In 1910 this proportion varied from 2 
per cent in Massachusetts to 74 per cent in Alabama. In 1920 the extremes 
were 8 per cent in Kansas and 44 per cent in Mississippi. 
Tables 43 and 44, and Diagram 5 (pp. 62 and 63) give the significant 
facts for the geographical divisions with regard to the percentages of local 
school revenues derived from state subventions. 
Poll and Other Special Taxes. — Most of the tax revenue of the local 
districts devoted to education and coming from other sources than general 
property comes from local taxes (primarily poll and dog taxes) specifically 
assigned to education.? All states obtain a part of their school revenues 
from the general property tax. In fourteen states there is a local poll tax 
for schools, in eight states a local dog tax, and in four states local licenses. 
The remainder of this tax revenue comes from appropriations from the 
general tax revenue of counties and cities. This general tax revenue is, of 
course, largely property tax revenue. 
Miscellaneous Local Revenues. — Miscellaneous local educational rev- 
enues are derived in large part from educational fees, although perhaps not 
to the same extent as state miscellaneous revenues. These fees include 
tuition paid by private individuals. Tuition paid by one district to another 
has been excluded as far as possible to avoid double counting. Fees 
charged for other than educational purposes are often assigned to schools, 
and also fines, forfeits, and escheats in a number of instances. Further, a 
certain amount of revenue is derived from interest on current school funds, 
rents, and other revenues coming in in the course of administering the 
schools. Finally, in a few states all or a large part of the permanent com- 
mon school funds are locally administered, and the revenues of these have 
been included under this heading. Altogether, these sources furnish only 
6.5 per cent of local school revenues.

Rewation or Tax Revenues To Incomes! 
The best single measure of tax-paying ability is income, and on this basis 
there was a large increase in taxes between 1910 and 1920. This increase 
was in federal taxes, however, to meet the cost of national defense. The 
percentage of income paid in state and local taxes in 1920 was one-tenth of 
one per cent lower than in 1910 and eight-tenths of one per cent lower 
than in 1915. 
No attempt has been made to distribute the federal taxes by states, 
because of the difficulties involved in obtaining any satisfactory basis for 
such a distribution. Income has been distributed, however, on the basis of 
the proportion of the total national income derived in each state in 1919.% 
‘The ratio of taxes to income in the different states computed on this basis is 
shown in Table 46, p. 64. 
1“ Income” here means an aggregate (expressed in dollars) of the commodities and services produced

According to this distribution the median percentage of income paid in 
taxes was (like the arithmetic mean) much higher in 1915 than in 1910, but 
dropped in 1920, and in seventeen widely scattered states and the District 
of Columbia the ratio of taxes to income was actually lower in 1920 than in 
1910. Grouping the states by geographical divisions, we find the following 
range for each group:

These figures, like the per-capita figures, indicate that a relatively high 
percentage of income goes to state and local taxes in the western states, 
and a comparatively small proportion in the southern group. There is wide 
variation in the percentages, however, even within the group, and taking 
the country as a whole we find the proportion of income being paid in state 
and local taxes in Montana nearly four times as high as that in Alabama or 
the District of Columbia. 
If income were to be accepted as a wholly reliable test of taxable ability, 
the western states would appear to be bearing a burden of taxes which on
-P-A-G-E-75

the whole is about double that of the southern states and in extreme cases 
three and nearly four times as large. It should be remembered, however, 
that the distribution of income, and the income per capita, is an important 
factor not taken into account in these figures. The per-capita income, as 
shown earlier in the report,! is much lower in the southern states, and the 
same percentage of this income taken in taxes represents a greater sacrifice. 
The median per-capita income in the southern states in 1919 was $429. 
The median per-capita income in the eastern group was $717, in the middle- 
western $644 and in the western $664.

The result of this annual deficit is a steady increase in the educational 
debt. This increase in the school debt has been overshadowed by the in- 
crease in federal indebtedness for national defense, so that the proportion 
of the total debt incurred for educational purposes was smaller in 1920 than 
in 1910. Also the growth of state highway debts has reduced the relative 
importance of the state education debt ; but the increase in the local school 
debt has exceeded the increase in local debts for all other purposes. 
The largest educational debt is found in the western states, where there 
has been very rapid development and a large amount of new building, for 
which the debt has not yet been paid.

The desirability of financing even capital outlays from loans is open to 
question in the larger cities, but in the small districts the custom of borrow- 
ing the necessary funds for buying school sites, erecting new buildings, and 
improving old buildings does make it possible to spread unusual expenditure 
over a period of years, and thus to maintain a fairly uniform tax rate. 
And as long as the debt does not outlast the improvement for which it has 
been incurred, and does not at any time exceed its value, it conforms to 
accepted business practice. Taking the United States as a whole, there is 
obviously a wide margin between the value of school property and the 
amount of bonded indebtedness outstanding, and when it is considered 
further that this is gross debt, with no allowance for sinking funds, the 
amount of borrowing would seem to be very moderate in the larger number 
of cases. 
Records of local debts for schools or for all purposes are even more incom- 
plete than records of revenues and expenditures. In a few states the only 
data available are the debts in cities of 30,000 population and over and in 
these a wide margin must be allowed for error. Further the “ value of 
school property,” although quite regularly reported, is not usually a trust- 
worthy figure. Careful valuations are rarely made and gross undervalua- 
tion seems to be the rule.! Asa result of this the ratio of the value of school 
property to the school debt given in Table 57 must be used with caution. 
Probably both figures are low rather than high in most cases, but the figures 
for property are probably farther below the true figures than those for debt. 
If this is the case, the true ratio between the two should run somewhat 
lower than those found in this table.

The ratio of bonded debt to the value of school property is rising very 
decidedly. The median percentage in 1910 was 17.1 (Colorado), in 1915, 
21.6 (Iowa), and in 1920, 26.1 (Nebraska). But in most states the average 
ratio of debt to property is still well under 50 per cent. In a few states, 
however, the margin would seem to be narrow, unless the undervaluation 
of property is very great, and when it is considered that these are averages 
for the entire state, it becomes apparent that there must be large numbers 
of districts which are bonded to approximately the full value of their school 
property. 
Restrictions oN Borrowina PowER 
Most districts are limited in their borrowing power by state laws.!. The 
usual limitations are on purpose, amount, rate of interest, and length of 
term. In general, bonds may be issued only for permanent improvements, 
although in practice a temporary debt for current expenses can frequently 
be funded. The only direct limitation on the amount of the debt is the 
limitation on the ratio of the outstanding debt to the value of taxable 
property. ‘This is found in thirty-one states, and in all but two of these 
the assessed value of taxable property is the base. In Iowa the base is 
true value of property and in New York assessed value of real estate. This 
provision sometimes applies to debt for all purposes, sometimes to debt 
for schools alone. The percentage varies from two to thirty, but 5 per cent 
1 See Appendix K, Table X, p. 176. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  
THE SCHOOL DEBT 81 
is the limit in nearly half of the cases. These restrictions frequently operate 
as very active checks on the increasing indebtedness, sometimes perhaps 
unwisely. 
The rate of interest for which bonds may be issued is frequently limited, 
but this is an ineffective provision unless accompanied, as occasionally it 
is, by a limitation on the price at which bonds may be issued. The term 
for which bonds may be issued is limited in twenty-two states to from fifteen 
to forty years, but this limitation is not always effective, since there is fre- 
quently the possibility of refunding. Thus, in most states, it is possible 
for a debt to remain outstanding after the building for which it was issued 
has become obsolete or has been destroyed. 
Although the average ratio of debt to property is not alarming in most 
states, particularly in view of the probable undervaluation of property, it 
must be remembered that these are averages and that there is undoubtedly 
wide variation from district to district. The rapid increase of bond issues 
makes it increasingly important for the state to control local borrowing ; 
and more careful limitation of the life of such bond issues and of the powers 
of refunding would seem desirable.

  APPENDIX A 
SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND METHOD OF COLLECTING DATA 
Tue estimates of governmental revenues, expenditures, and debt in this 
study have been built up, state by state, from such data as are available 
in state and federal financial and educational reports, and such additional 
information as could be obtained by correspondence with state officials 
and others having access to unpublished information concerning state and 
local finance. The difficulties involved in making such estimates are largely 
the result of the lack of any information concerning the finances of the 
smaller local districts in many states, and the incompleteness of the data 
concerning many important municipalities and some states. Problems 
also arise from the absence of uniform systems of accounting and the varia- 
tions in the fiscal year. 
No complete compilation of state and local revenues in the United States 
has been made since 1902, when the Bureau of the Census issued its first 
report on Wealth, Debt, and Taxation. In 1913 this publication was 
repeated, but only for states, counties, and incorporated places with a 
population of 2,500 or more. This excludes a very considerable part of the 
local revenues and expenditures, particularly those of school districts. The 
figures published in these volumes were, in a few cases, the only available 
data for estimating certain local revenues and expenditures in 1910 and 
1915. 
For state finances the annual reports of the Bureau of the Census on 
Financial Statistics of States were valuable sources. It was possible to 
get most of the data for states for 1915 from the 1915 and 1916 volumes of 
this series, with some modifications to allow for a somewhat different classi- 
fication. These reports were not published, however, in either 1910 or 
1920, although a part of the 1920 figures could be found for some of those 
states with the fiscal year ending between July 1 and December 31 in the 
incomplete. 1921 volume. All information for 1910, and most of that for 
1920, had to be obtained from reports of state financial officials ; and these 
were also used to check and supplement such information as was available 
in the census reports. In a few states financial reports have not yet been 
published for 1920, and in one or two instances, owing to the failure of the 
legislature to make the necessary appropriations, reports have not been 
published even for the earlier years. Questionnaires sent to state financial 
officials usually brought courteous replies, but little information. The 
85
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 FINANCIAL STATISTICS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
revenues and expenditures of the local districts are, of course, much more 
difficult to obtain than state figures. As stated above, the Bureau of the 
Census published complete figures (partly estimated) for 1902, and in 1913 
published figures which were complete for counties and incorporated places 
with a population in excess of 2,500. In addition to this most of the finan- 
cial data desired are available for cities with a population of 30,000 and over 
for the years 1910 and 1915 in the annual reports of the Bureau of the Census 
on Financial Statistics of Cities. This report was compiled in 1920 and the 
1921 volume is incomplete. These sources are supplemented by various 
state publications. Complete and fairly well-classified financial statistics are 
now published for all local subdivisions in California, Connecticut, Iowa, 
Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin, but in 1910 complete figures 
were published only in Massachusetts. Figures were also available for New 
Jersey for 1920, although these have never been published. A number of 
other states incorporate some data on local finances in their reports of state 
finances. County finances are frequently given in more or less complete 
form; and also the total levy of property taxes for state and local purposes 
is often available. Beyond this, however, little information is to be obtained. 
Actual collections of the property tax are rarely given, and collections of other 
taxes and other sources of revenue are even more unusual. Expenditures 
are not ordinarily recorded and can only be estimated from the amounts and 
purposes of the property tax levies. 
Figures for educational finances are far more complete, fortunately, 
than other local finances, since the prevalence of state subventions has 
resulted in centralized control and reporting of finances. The greatest 
difficulty encountered here was in segregating the educational revenues and 
expenditures in some of those cities where there is no independent adminis- 
tration of educational finances. 
It is apparent from this brief survey that there are many gaps in the 
available information concerning local finances. Fortunately, however, 
the few states publishing the revenues and expenditures of local districts are 
states in which these revenues and expenditures are relatively large; and 
these, together with the figures in the Census Bureau publications for cities 
of 30,000 population and over, and the school finances in the state education 
reports, comprise approximately 80 per cent of all local revenues and 
expenditures for the year 1920, and almost as large a proportion in the 
earlier years. 
The lack of uniform accounting has made it difficult to make data com- 
parable for different years and different jurisdictions, even where data are 
almost complete. In some cases the sources of revenues are not enumer- 
ated, and in other cases no statement is given of the purposes of expenditure. 
This makes it difficult to obtain the exact sums spent for education and for 
highways, and further makes it impossible, in some cases, to discover and
-P-A-G-E-95
APPENDIX A 87 
eliminate all non-revenue receipts and non-governmental cost payments to 
obtain a net figure for revenues and expenditures. Even where details are 
given they are often inadequate, and classifications, where there are any, 
vary widely. Moreover, the custom of receiving and disbursing moneys by 
funds involves frequent transfers between these funds, and makes it diffi- 
cult, and sometimes perhaps impossible, to eliminate all double counting. 
In some states the accounts of some of the state institutions do not pass 
through any central office and the state financial reports contain no records 
of the receipts and expenditures of these institutions. It is frequently 
difficult to discover, in consequence, whether or not the state reports are 
complete, and if they are incomplete, to obtain the missing accounts. Even 
in the case of educational finances it is sometimes difficult to obtain a net 
figure for revenues and expenditures, and to split up these items in accord- 
ance with the divisions desired. 
The period included for each year is the fiscal year of each jurisdiction 
closing during the calendar years 1910, 1915, and 1920. The publication 
of state financial reports is often so long delayed that it was impracticable 
to obtain data for any year later than 1920. It is, of course, impossible to 
obtain figures for the different jurisdictions covering the same period. 
The fiscal years of the general treasuries of the different states in 1920 
closed on nine different dates throughout the year. In many of these, 
further, the period of the fiscal year varied for different state funds. In 
one state there were ten different dates for the close of the fiscal years of as 
many different state funds. The local jurisdictions have, of course, other 
and varied dates for the close of their fiscal years. Most of these fiscal 
years close between June 30 and December 31. This is true of all but two 
of the general state treasury funds, almost all school funds, and a 
very large part of the municipal funds. Consequently there is a smaller 
gap between the close of the different periods when the fiscal year closing 
during the calendar year is chosen as a base than there would be if the 
period chosen were that of the fiscal year preceding June 30, the year used 
in the Census Bureau publications. Taking the calendar year as the base 
avoids combining state and local fiscal years closing June 30 with school 
fiscal years closing July 31 of the preceding year, with only one month of the 
year overlapping. Even so it has been necessary to make some adjustments 
in adding up the figures of state and local districts with different fiscal years.

3 This is net revenue, excluding receipts from loans, refunds, and transfers of all kinds. To avoid double 
counting the amount of the state subvention has been subtracted from the sum of the state total and the 
local total to obtain this state and local total. The state subvention comes originally from state taxes, but 
when transferred to the local districts, it becomes a part of the revenues of the local districts. Consequently 
it has been included in both the state and the local revenues where these are considered separately. The 
income of permanent school funds, which is included in this total, is listed separately in Table IV A, p. 145. 
4 The only federal subventions, other than those for education, received in 1910 and 1915 were for soldiers’ 
and sailors’ homes. The federal subventions for education in 1910 were those for agricultural and mechan- 
ical colleges and agricultural experiment stations granted under the Morrill, Nelson, Hatch, and Adams acts 
and moneys received in some states from the national forest fund for roads and schools. In 1915 there was 
in addition to these, the aid granted by the Smith-Lever act for the states relations service, and in 1920 the 
vocational aid from the Smith-Hughes act. The amount of these aids has been so difficult to find in state 
reports, since some of it frequently goes directly to the institutions concerned without passing through the 
state treasury, that in most cases the sums appearing under this heading have been taken from national 
government reports. The states so regularly match the sums when required that the amount reported by the national government as due the states is normally paid to them in full, so that the use of the national 
reports does not lead to any appreciable overstatement of sums received. 
5 This is a net figure and does not include debt payments, amounts paid to sinking funds, and investments 
and transfers. The total state and local expenditure is smaller than the sum of the total state expenditures 
and total local expenditures by the amount of the state subvention. 
* This is gross outstanding bonded indebtedness. Figures for local sinking funds are so incomplete that 
it is impossible to obtain a figure for net bonded indebtedness,

1 Auditor’s Reports, 1910, 1920; Treasurer’s Report, 1915. These did not include the revenues and 
expenditures of state educational institutions which were obtained from the Reports of the United States 
Commissioner of Education. Figures for cities with 30,000 population and over from Financial Statistics 
of Cities. Other local figures estimated from Reports on Wealth, Debt, and Taxation for 1902 and 1913 as 
follows: The total for 1913 was estimated by assuming that the revenues and expenditures of those dis- 
tricts with a population of less than 2,500 (which were not reported in 1913) had increased at the same rate 
as revenues and expenditures of the districts given, and the amount thus obtained was added to the 1913 
total. Then an equal annual increase was assumed for the intervening period to obtain the figures for 1910. 
The same increase was assumed for the two years following 1913 to obtain the 1915 figures. These figures 
were checked against local educational figures as far as possible. The increase for 1920 was assumed to be 
equal to the per-capita increase in cities of 30,000 population and over and in school districts. 
2 Elementary and secondary school revenues and expenditures from Annual Reports of State Department 
of Education ; figures for colleges and normal schools from Annual Reports of U. S. Commissioner of Edu- 
cation; figures for state administration from State Auditor’s and Treasurer's reports. 
% Subvention for 1910 and 1920 for education only. Subvention for 1915 for education and highways. 
4 Local bonded indebtedness for schools estimated to be the same percentage of total local indebtedness 
as the average percentage of total local indebtedness incurred for education found in states in this geo- 
graphical division for which such figures are available.

1 Reports of State Auditor and State Tax Commission, checked in 1915 by Financial Statistics of States. State debt from Wealth, Debt, and Taxation and Financial Statistics of States. Local finances from Re- ports of State Tax Commission. Such revenues and expenditures as are not available in these were esti- mated from the revenues and expenditures for education, and from the revenues and expenditures for all purposes in the Reports on Wealth, Debt, and Taxation by applying to the local tax levies for each year the ratio of such revenues and expenditures to taxes in 1913. Local debt for 1910 and 1915 estimated from debt reported in Wealth, Debt, and Taxation in 1902 and 1913 on assumption of equal annual increase through 1915. 
2 Questionnaire returned by State Department of Education, supplemented (for university revenues not passing through the hands of the State Treasurer) by Reports of U. 8. Commissioner of Education, and by Reports of State Auditor.

local highway expenditures reported in U. S. Statistical Abstract, 1920, further checked by letter from Fed- 
eral Bureau of Roads.

increase between 1902 and 1913 (Wealth, Debt, and Taxation) and assuming same increase through 1920. See above, p. 89, note 4. 
4 All state subventions in this year are for education. The difference in the sums reported under the 
“‘ all purposes ” column and the “ education” column is due to difference in sources (either because of a different classification or a different fiscal year). It has seemed better in each case to use the subvention figure from the source from which all the other figures in the column were taken and not to try to reconcile the two.

1 Reports of State Auditor, checked in 1915 and 1920 by Financial Statistics of States. For local 
finances, 1910 and 1915, see above, p. 89, note 1. 1920 estimated from tax levy for that year as above, 
p. 93, note 1. 
2 Letters and Reports from State Department of Education; Report of U. 8. Commissioner of Educa- 
tion; Reports of State Auditor. 
3 All state subventions were for education in 1910 and 1915. The figure for the total subvention in 
1910 and 1915 was taken from the State Auditor’s Report. The figure for 1915 agrees fairly well with 
that in Financial Statistics of States. The figure for the educational subvention for 1910 was taken from 
the Report of the State Board of Education. The figure in the Report of the U. 8. Commissioner of 
Education lies between this and the figure in the State Auditor’s Report. The Educational subvention for 1915 was taken from the Report of the U. S. Commissioner of Education. Since it was necessary to take 
the other figures for total expenditures and educational expenditures from the different reports from which 
the subvention figures have been taken in each case, it seemed better not to attempt to reconcile the two.

1 Methods of distribution are so complex that there is necessarily some overlapping in any classification 
used. Cross-references have been given to indicate the most important cases of such overlapping. 
2 In most cases this amounts to state administration of local revenues with no redistribution of funds. 
8 Inso far as these are rough measures of costs there is some attempt here to redistribute funds in accord- 
ance with need. 
4 These are the only aids which result in any real equalization of burden. 
5 These subventions are almost entirely for the purpose of stimulating the local district to develop special 
types of educational activity.

2. References to pages cover discussion only, indicated as p. 1, p. 2, p. 3, ete. 
3. The term entire country in this report invariably means the forty-eight states 
and District of Columbia combined. 
4. Data on the entire country generally occur in tables having a grand total with 
subtotals for the respective parts of the national, state, local, and state and 
local (combined) jurisdictions. Consequently, these five terms do not 
appear as main heads and not always as subheads in the index. Example: 
To find the total governmental expenditures for the entire country, look for 
Expenditures, governmental, 
entire country, 
totals 
which list Table 1 where the desired local figures are readily found. 
5. For data on any particular state, on each topic of interest, look up the tables 
listing geographical divisions or individual states. Thus the per-capita 
educational debt of Arizona may be quickly found by looking up 
Debt, 
educational, bonded outstanding, 
state and local, per capita, 
geographical divisions, T56 
individual states, T55.

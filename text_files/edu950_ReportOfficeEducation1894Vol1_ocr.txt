  REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. 0., May 1, 1896. 
Srr: I have the honor to submit herewith my seventh annual report, 
- the same being for the year ending June 30, 1895. 
WHOLE NUMBER ENROLLED IN SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. 
There were enrolled in the schools and colleges, public and private, 
of the United States during the school year 1894-95, 15,688,622 pupils, 
being an increase of 158,354 over the previous year. <A detailed classi- 
fication of these pupils is given on pages XI and XII, showing the num- 
ber in the elementary schools, in the secondary schools and in the vari- 
ous institutions for higher education. 
The number in schools supported by public funds and taxation was 
14,280,070; the number in private institutions, 1,408,552. 
In addition there were some 400,000 persons enrolled in various 
special schools and institutions such as business colleges, trade schools, 
conservatories of music, schools of art and elocution, schools for delin- 
quent and for defective classes, Indian schools, evening schools, ete., 
making a grand total of about 16,100,000 persons who attended a school 
of some kind for a longer or shorter period during the year. 
THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 
The term “common schools” is used by this office to include public 
elementary and secondary day schools. The following table gives a 
condensed summary of the common-school statistics compiled from data 
furnished this office by the State superintendents. The returns are 
to be found in detail on pages xxxv and Lyi. The corresponding 
figures for the school year 1893-94 are given in a parallel column in 
order to facilitate comparison. It will be seen that the increase for the 
year is 265,775 pupils. ,

  WHOLE NUMBER OF PUPILS AND STUDENTS. XIII 
In my last report I commented on the extraordinary increase in enroll- 
ment shown by the returns for 1893-94—an increase of 425,258 in the 
public elementary and secondary schools, and the largest increase for 
any one year ever recorded in the nation. It was explained that this 
gain occurred during a wide spread business depression, and that it indi- 
cated the wise endeavor on the part of the people to make up for the 
loss occasioned by irregular and uncertain wages by sending to school 
not only the younger children, but also their older children, temporarily 
thrown out of occupation as wage earners. 
The percentage of the total population enrolled in the public schools 
was 20.65, as compared with 20.53 of the previous year—a slight increase 
over that year. This percentage of school pupils has increased from 
19.67 in 1879-80. There are, it would appear, in every 10,000 persons 
98 more enrolled in school than in 1880. 
It is noticeable that the average number of days in the school year 
has increased slightly, namely, 141.4 compared with 139 of last year. 
This is the largest average ever reached in this country. There has 
been also, it would appear, a slight increase of monthly wages for the 
teachers. In the following tables I show the increase of amount of 
schooling afforded each citizen in the several parts of the country. 
The first table includes the amount of schooling given in both private 
and public schools, and the second the amount given in the public 
schools only. This is a very interesting table, as it shows at a glance 
the net result of the entire school system of the country. It would 
appear that at the rate of attendance on the schools the past year 
the entire population is receiving an average of 43 years of 200 days 
each. This is certainly not a very large amount, but in the compara- 
tive table it will be seen that there has been a very considerable increase 
since 1870, when the total amount of schooling received in public and 
private schools was only 3.32 years of 200 days each. It is of interest 
to name the eight States that lead in the matter of average amount of 
education: Massachusetts furnishes 8.04 years per inhabitant; Con- 
necticut, 7.31 years; New York, 6.83 years; Rhode Island, 6.76 years; 
Ohio, 6.59 years; Iowa, 6.33 years; Illinois and New Jersey, 6.29 years. 
A calculation of the amount received in the schools of the German 
Empire shows that the entire population was receiving in 1893 an aver- 
age of 7.2 years of 200 days each. It should be mentioned that this item 
includes only the amount given in the elementary schools. It should 
be slightly increased to include secondary instruction and instruction 
in the universities.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 
The consolidated statisties of 574 city school systems are ineluded in 
Chapter I, pages 14 to 17; the statistics of the individual city systems 
are given inPartIII. Since villages are constantly growing into cities 
the list increases from year to year. This increase should be borne in 
mind in making comparison of the present with former years. It is 
understood that with the growth of cities there is an improvement in 
the schools. From the unclassified school, wherein the teacher receives 
all grades of pupils from a b ¢s to algebra, the village makes progress 
to the graded school or union school, wherein pupils are classified and 
separate teachers provided for each grade. Longer time may be given 
to the work of the recitation in the graded school and the pupil taught 
how to study his lesson, and how to overcome its difficulties. From the 
village to the city there is continual progress in grading and classifica- 
tion. In Table No. 5, page 16, the ratio of attendance on public schools 
compared with private and parochial schools is shown. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The tables given in Chapter II, showing the attendance on public 
high schools and private academies and seminaries so far as secondary 
instruction is concerned, show 22,681 teachers instructing 468,446 pupils 
in the 6,892 schools of this grade; 4,712 of these are public high schools 
and 2,180 are private academies or seminaries. It isinteresting to note
-P-A-G-E-15
  NORMAL SCHOOLS. XV 
that 17 per eent, or one-sixth of the pupils, were preparing for college. 
Nearly one-half of all these pupils were studying Latin, and about one- 
twentieth of the number were studying Greek. The circulars of inquiry 
sent out from this Bureau requested a specification of the studies which 
the pupils returned as secondary were pursuing. <A list of these secon- 
dary studies will be found in Chapter IT (pp. 23-25). In-the compara- 
tive table, page 20, showing the records of secondary pupils for several 
years, there will be found great discrepancies, due in part to the change 
on the part of this Bureau of its definition of the term “secondary in- 
struction.” J'ormerly the Bureau accepted the classification as made 
by the several schools, and in many cases pupils in elementary studies 
were reported as secondary pupils for no other reason apparently than 
because they attended the building in which secondary instruction was 
conducted. By degrees this Bureau has been able to sift out the ele- 
mentary pupils from the secondary pupils in the returns, and now offers 
a much more accurate exhibit of secondary work in the country than 
formerly. But it must be confessed that the secondary schools proper 
do not contain all of the pupils reeeiving secondary instruction. Just 
as many secondary schools, so called,-contain elementary pupils, so 
some elementary schools give secondary instruction to individuals and 
even to classes. This is carried on to a greater extent in the Southern 
and Western States than in the North Atlantic and North Central 
States. What addition should be made to the figures kere reported, to 
include all such secondary pupils, it is hazardous to estimate, but prob- 
ably the number would fall much below 10 per cent of the ent-e number 
reported in the tables. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In Chapter HI (pp. 107-148) the consolidated statistics of normal 
schools are given. There were 80,839 students in the country pursuing 
training courses for teachers. Of this number perhaps 12,000 per 
annum may be counted as graduates. To supply the places made 
vacant in a corps of teachers of 400,000, besides filling the positions in 
new schools opened during the year, upward of 60,000 teachers are 
required. Hence the supply from the professional schools is sufficient 
only to furnish one-fifth of the teachers demanded. But it must be 
remembered that professionally trained teachers remain in the work of 
teaching much longer than the persons who take up the work as a 
makeshift; hence out of the 400,000 teachers employed in the United 
States there is a much larger proportion of the former than the supply 
from normal schools would seem to indicate. In some States the num- 
ber of teachers professionally trained exceeds 50 per cent of the entire 
number. 
Another table gives the names of the universities and colleges in 
which training courses for teachers are provided. Their number has 
increased from 114 colleges in 1890, with an enrollment of 3,414 students 
in the normal department, to 192 in 1895, with 6,402 normal students.
-P-A-G-E-16
  XVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Twenty-seven universities have regularly organized departments of 
pedagogy, and offer professional training of a high character in courses 
of study extending over four years and leading to degrees of pedagogy. 
In Chapter III will be found an interesting table outlining the course 
of pedagogy offered in each of the twenty-seven institutions. : 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Universities and colleges (pp. 149-169).—The total number of univer- 
sities and colleges for men and for both sexes reporting to this office 
during the year was 481, each State and Territory being represented 
by at least one institution. The number of instructors reported by these 
institutions was 11,582, while the number of students of all classes 
was 149,939. Of the latter number 46,098 were enrolled in preparatory 
departments, 63,402 in collegiate departments, 4,273 in graduate 
departments, and 23,567 in professional departments. The property 
reported was as follows: Volumes in libraries, 6,092,673; value of 
material equipment, $129,025,653; productive funds, $102,574,808. 
The benefactions amounted to $5,350,963, and the total income, exclud- 
ing benefactions, was $16,783,638, 
Colleges for women (pp. 169-177).—The 163 colleges for women had, 
in 1894-95, 2,425 instructors and 24,193 students. The material equip- 
ment was valued at $15,919,990, and the endowment funds at $5,172,767. 
The income was $3,441,158, and the benefactions $625,734. 
Schools of technology (pp. 178-184).—The number of schools of tech- 
nology, excluding technological departments of universities and col- 
leges, was 51, having 1,217 instructors and 13,896 students. The 
material equipment was valued at $15,522,676, and the productive funds 
at $13,609,529. The income of these institutions was $3,965,593, and 
the benefactions $21,530. 
Professional schools (pp. 235-255).—There were 149 schools of the- 
ology, with 906 professors, 8,050 students, and 1,598 graduates in 
1894-95. During five years theological schools only increased by 7 
and theological students by 700. More than three-fourths of the stud- 
ents were in the North Central and North Atlantic divisions. In the 
Western division there were only 80 theological students, the small 
number being attributable to the fact that the various denominations 
had already established theological schools in the older and more east- 
ern States. 
Law schools numbered 72—not quite half as many as theological; 
put while thelogical schools increased only 7, law schools increased 18 
in number in five years; and while theological students increased only 
about 700 in number, law students increased 3,700. The number of 
law students was 8,950, and the number of graduates 2,717. 
The address of Justice David J. Brewer, of the United States 
Supreme Court, before the American Bar Association, on “ A better 
education the great need of the profession,” is given in full, and
-P-A-G-E-17

presents in a vivid manner the great influence of the legal profession in 
shaping the policy and determining the destiny of American institu- 
tions, and consequently the importance of a bar with liberal culture, 
professional honor, and the highest legal attainment. 
Medical schools numbered 151, of which 113 were regular, 20 homeo- 
pathic, 9 eclectic, 2 physiomedical, and 7 graduate. Medical students 
number more than twice those in cither law or theology, viz, 22,887, of 
whom 18,660 were in regular schools, 1,875 in homeopathic, and 732 in 
eclectic. Notwithstanding the lengthening of the medical course to 
three years, and afterwards to four years in many schools, and notwith- 
standing the rigid medical practice requirements already adopted in 
many States and still being adopted in others, the number of students 
has constantly increased in both regular and homeopathic colleges. 
The educational qualifications demanded of prospective physicians 
instead of affrighting students seem only to have enhanced their 
appreciation of a medical diploma and of a State license. 
Schools of dentistry numbered 45, and dental students 5,347, more 
than 2,000 over the number attending five years before. While the 
adoption of a three years’ course in dentistry did not diminish the num- 
ber of students, it has diminished the number of graduates, the number 
in 1894-95 being practically the same as the number four years before. 
Schools of pharmacy numbered 39, with 3,859 students, about 1,000 
more than five years before. 
Schools for the training of nurses numbered 131, while the number 
in 1890-91 was only 34. In fact, the nurse training school is compara- 
tively a new institution. It was not many years ago when one of the 
largest hospitals in New York City found it necessary to advertise for 
what at that time even was considered a competent nurse. In the 
Southern and far Western States trained nurses are even at this time 
uncommon, Inthe South Atlantic Division, in 1894-95, there were only 
11 training schools, and most of these were in the border cities—Wash- 
ington and Baltimore. In the South Central Division there was only 
1, and in the Western only 3. New schools are rapidly being organ- 
ized, however, as is indicated by the addition of about 25 new names 
to the list since the table in this report was compiled. 
GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 
Two events of unusual importance have occurred in England during 
the scholastic year 1894-95. One of these is the revival of the question 
of religious instruction in board or public elementary schools, and in 
general the relation of the State to denominational or parochial schools; 
the other is the publication of the report of the Royal Commission on 
secondary education. The question of religious instruction was unex- 
pectedly revived in the London School Board just before the crisis that 
brought the conservative party again into control of the Government. 
As this party had made pledges to secure favorable legislation for 
ED 95——Ii1
-P-A-G-E-18
  XVII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
denominational schools, the agitation in the metropolis became part of 
a controversy which has extended over the whole country. An impor- 
tant principle is involved in the effort to seeure increased public aid 
for schools under private management, namely, that of the application 
of public funds where public control can not follow. A large propor- 
tion of the English people are opposed to such a policy, and even 
extreme advocates of denominational schools realize that it is danger- 
ous to provoke this contest. The outcome of the controversy can not 
be foreseen at this date. The events which have marked its inception 
and progress, as set forth in Chapter VI (pp. 257-273), are full of sig- 
- nificance. 
_ The growing activity of the State in educational matters is not only 
shown in its influence as an organizing power, but in the increase of 
appropriations from the public treasury. In a little less than two dec- 
ades the Government grant to elementary schools in England has 
increased by nearly 300 per cent, and in Scotland in fourteen years by 
about 120 per cent. From this grant in 1894-95 was derived 67 per 
cent of the income for elementary schools in England and 73 per cent 
in Scotland. These estimates include the grant in lieu of fees allowed 
under laws of 1890 and 1891, and amounting to about one-third of the 
entire appropriation. Local taxes provide about one-fifth the income 
of elementary schools in England, and a little more than one-fifth in 
Scotland, leaving but a small balance in either division to be met from 
fees and voluntary subscriptions. The increase in enrollment in Eng- 
land far exceeds that in population. It is evident, indeed, that the 
purpose of the school law of 1870 to bring all the children of the 
country under school influences has been realized. 
The total enrollment in England, 5,235,887, was equivalent to 17 per 
cent of the population; in Scotland, where the enrollment was 699,716, 
the ratio was slightly smaller, i. e., 16.6 per cent. 
The enrollment in England was distributed as follows: Board schools, 
42 per cent; Church of England schools, 44 per cent; Wesleyan 
schools, 3 per cent; Roman Catholic schools, 5 per cent, and British 
undenominational and other schools, 5.8 per cent. 
The detailed statistics presented in Chapter VI illustrate the progress 
of the elementary school system in other particulars, notably the 
inerease in the number of adult and certificated teachers, the develop- 
ment of night schools and the success of measures for freeing elementary 
education from mechanical routine. : 
THE MANITOBA SCHOOL QUESTION. 
Chapter VII (pp. 275-288) presents a dispassionate statement of the 
legal aspects of the Manitoba school case, for which the office is 
indebted to Mr. Henry R. Alley, secretary to the minister of education 
for the Province of Ontario. 
The principal events which have marked the progress of the case 
 
-P-A-G-E-19

since this statement was closed are added, and an introduction which 
sets forth in brief the peculiar local conditions that have to be met in 
the practical endeavor to establish and maintain schools. A feature of 
special interest to us is the mixture of peoples and of languages that 
are comprised in the sparse population of this border Province. 
Here, also, as in our newly settled States, the difficulty of securing 
competent teachers is one of the most serious with which schcol 
authorities have to deal. Manitoba has shown a disposition to follow 
the precedent of Ontario in respect to provision for the training of 
teachers. The allowance for teachers’ salaries is augmented. by legis- 
lative and municipal grants—the former, $130; the latter, from $200 to 
$400 annually for each teacher. With all wise provisions, the existing 
obstacles to an adequate supply of competent teachers are not over- 
come. The Rey. Principal Grant, of Queen’s College and University, 
Kingston, Ontario, has given a graphic picture of these conditions in 
his report of a recent tour of investigation through the Province. Cita- 
tions from the report serve to emphasize the indications of the official 
statistics presented in the introduction. 
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 
Chapter VIII (pp. 289-312) presents the latest published statistics of 
education in France, which show for elementary schools a slight decline 
in enrollment during the five years 1887 to 1892. This decline, it may 
be observed, is not entirely accounted for by the decrease in popula- 
tion, since in 1886-87 there were 1,446 pupils for every 10,000 inhabi- 
tants, whereas in 1891-92 the corresponding number had fallen to 
1,434. The number of teachers has inereased by 8,019, or 6 per cent, 
during the half decade, and the total expenditure for elementary edu- 
cation in the same time by 74 per cent. The State having assumed the 
payment of teachers’ salaries, bore 84 per cent of the total expenditure 
in 1892, as against 48.9 per cent in'1887. 
In the department of higher education the work of developing and 
reorganizing university courses continues. During the present year the 
doctorate of law has been constituted in two forms, i. e., the doctorate 
of legal science, and the doctorate of political and economic science. 
The course in law has been correspondingly divided. Moreover, the 
elective principle has been admitted to a slight degree in each course. 
Thus efforts dating as far back as 1789 to secure State recognition for 
studies relating particularly to the demands of modern society have 
been brought to a successful close. 
The most important recent movement pertaining to popular educa- 
tion is that for the instruction of adults. Schools and classes for adults 
have been maintained, either by church or state or private agencies, 
for nearly two centuries. The present Government fostered these

for adults declined. The movement for their revival which has sud- 
denly engaged attention has a different end in view. 
The belief that crime is increasing among the youth of France is 
widespread, and the tendency is recognized as a grave peril to the 
State. One cause of this evil is found in the lack of restraints dur- 
ing the susceptible and wayward years of adolescence. It is chiefly 
as a means of building up character and of developing an interest 
in useful pursuits that provision for continued education is urged. 
Private societies are leading the work, which has also the full support 
of Government. 
Chapter VIIT presents also a survey of the movement for the admis- 
sion of American students to French universities. Through the efforts 
of Prof. H. Furber, of Chicago, and the cooperation of leading univer- 
sity men in France, a Franco-American committee has been formed to 
devise practical measures for bringing the university honors of France 
within the reach of students from this country. An American advisory 
committee has also been formed, under the presidency of Prof. Simon 
Newcomb, whose counsels will have great weight in determining the 
concessions that shall be made in the interests of our students. Already 
a measure has been secured which enables students from the United 
States to enter the faculty of sciences as candidates for the degree of 
licentiate on the basis of their American diplomas. After this degree 
is attained, the doctor’s degree may be secured on substantially the 
same terms as In Germany. 
BELGIUM. 
The passage of a new school law for Belgium is one of the most not- 
able events of the year. Religion, which under the liberal law of 1879 
was excluded from the programmes, was restored by the conservatives 
as an optional branch in 1884, and now, under the new law bearing date 
September 15, 1895, is made obligatory in all elementary schools. 
Moreover the subject is confided to the care of the clergy of the several 
denominations, who must give the instruction or designate the proper 
person for the duty. The law encounters great opposition in the cities 
and its effects will be followed with deep interest in all countries. 
The chief provisions of the law are cited in Chapter IX (pp. 313-319), 
which comprises also a brief view of the educational system of Belgium, 
with statistics showing its progress and present status. 
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE, 
Chapter X (pp. 321-470) contains, under the caption “ Education in 
central Europe,” first, a translation of Prof. W. Rein’s article on “The 
new education in Germany,” which sets forth the chief features of 
Herbart’s system as advocated by his disciples at the present day. 
Professor Rein succeeded Professor Stoy at the university of Jena, and 
is considered an authority on education, according to Herbart. 
A translation of an article by Dr. Fr. Dittes, of Vienna (formerly
-P-A-G-E-21
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. XXI 
school councilor in Gotha and president of the City Normal College of 
Vienna), who writes under the caption “Is German pedagogy in a 
state of decomposition?” shows the other side of the question as seen 
in Germany. : 
The account of the Berlin city school system contained in last year’s 
annual report is continued in this volume by a statement of supple- 
mentary and industrial schools in Germany, especially in Berlin. These 
schools are a feature of the German educational system with which the 
American public is not very familiar. The only element of our system 
that may be compared with them is found in our city evening schools. 
The German school authorities endeavor to prepare for skilled labor 
and thus increase the productiveness of their sources of wealth. The 
yalue of the account is enhanced by the addition of extracts from 
reports sent to the State Department by the consul-general of the United 
States and courteously loaned to the Department of the Interior. 
The question of how to improve the rural schools, at present much 
discussed by teachers in this country, has suggested a presentation of 
the status of rural schools in Germany, their organization, course 
of study, methods of teaching, and means of instruction. The mon- - 
itorial system of teaching has been suggested as containing hints for 
methods of instruction. The article in this report on “Rural and 
ungraded schools in Germany” contains a statement of the value 
and the mode of application of the so-called Bell-Lancaster system of 
employing pupil teachers or utilizing advanced pupils in keeping 
school or hearing lessons. The advantages and defects of this system 
are shown in an additional chapter containing authoritative expres- 
sions of German educators on this system. 
Another interesting subject under discussion in educational gather- 
ings is the course of study for elementary schools. The action of the 
National Educational Association in this direction was sketched in last 
year’s report. The problem of finding the relative value of studies 
has of late agitated the minds of German teachers as well, as is seen 
fron an inquiry into the courses prescribed in sixteen German cities, 
here given in an English translation. The relative value of the various 
branches of instruction is expressed in the numbers of lessons assigned 
to them. This, of course, does not consider the personal element, the 
teacher, nor should that element be considered in this connection. Mr. 
J. Tews, of Berlin, collected these courses and presented them in a 
* comparative table to the readers of the Paedagogische Zeitung (Berlin). 
The annual report for 1891-92 contained a statement of the history 
and methods of training teachers in central Europe, in which the nor- 
mal schocls of Switzerland were duly mentioned, but not described. 
The present chapter treats of them more fully and enters into detail. 
The Swiss school system, like ours, is not a federal system, but is estab- 
lished, maintained, and regulated by the separate States, called Can- 
tons in Switzerland.

XXIT REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The eighth part of this chapter is devoted to an account of the ani- 
mated discussion of ‘Mental fatigue in school,” going on at present in 
Germany. It has been claimed that secondary schools in Germany are 
ovetworking their pupils. Representatives of the science of hygiene, 
fecling themselves called upon to substantiate these charges, subjected 
some schools to a rigid test. Noted professors, such as Burgerstein in 
Vienna, Hoepfner in Berlin, Kraepelin in Heidelberg, Richter in Halle, 
and others, are made to contribute to this symposium with excerpts 
from their publications, which ave based upon actual tests made in 
school. The burden of argument in defense of the school is borne by 
Professor Richter, who published his impressive deductions from the 
results of tests in a periodical, entitled Lehrproben und Lehrgaenge. 
The problem is not yet solved, since few of the contributors to the dis- 
eussion seem to-take into consideration the climatic effects, locality of 
' the school and home, and individual predisposition of the pupils. 
Another contribution to this. chapter consists of a translation of 
Prof. Stephan Waetzoldt’s paper, entitled “‘ National features of female 
education,” in which he states that he who has accustomed himself to 
understand historically that which exists in the education of a people, 
and compares it with the work and the results of other nations upon 
similar lines, will not be ‘apt to believe in the possibility or utility of 
borrowing by one nation from another without extensive modifications 
and adaptations; every educator will try to understand and to explain, 
but will refrain from copying, for in the end every nation finds that 
which is best adapted to its needs, and finds it in its own way. This 
truth he proves by showing how the types of woman’s education have 
developed in France, Germany, England, and the United States. His 
valuable criticism of American education already published (in trans- 
lation) in the annual report of this Bureau for 1892-93 has created a 
timely interest in the presen¢ article. The fact that Professor Waet- 
zoldt’s article appears in the official organ of the Prussian minister of 
public instruction indicates the weight that the Government gives to 
the author’s opinion. . 
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS.   There has also been prepared for this report a chapter on teachers’ 
pensions and annuities (Chapter XX.) This is, at present, a question 
which is agitating teachers and legislators. In order toshow what has 
been done in this line, a statement of the laws and regulations in force 
in this country is offered, together with the modus operandi of inde- ° 
pendent efforts on the part of teachers’ annuity societies. It may 
astonish the adherent of the so-called American maxim, “no pensions 
for civil officers,” to notice how often this principle has been set aside in 
recent times by State laws and municipal ordinances. To teachers who 
desire information as to how to proceed in framing constitutions and 
by-laws of annuity societies, and who may wish to submit bills for pen- 
sion laws, the present chapter may be serviceable. It is noticeable that

in the city of New York the fractions of salary forfeited by teachers or 
other school employees, owing to absence from duty, together with 1

ficient to create a fund for the retirement of old or incapacitated teach- 
ers, which fund has assumed considerable proportions—about $65,000, 
THE NETHERLANDS. 
In Chapter XI (pp. 475-542) the specialist discusses education in the 
Netherlands and commences with a brief historical introduction, trac- 
ing the rise of education in thatcountry. Many statistics are presented 
showing the number and kinds of primary and secondary schools, the 
number of pupils of each sex attending, the cost and sources of revenue, 
whether from the treasuries of the communes and provinces or the 
general treasury of the State. The specialist has also compared the 
attendance and cost of these schools in 1889-90 and in 1893-94, show- 
ing in most cases a gratifying increase in school facilities. Brief state- 
ments on the organization, apparatus, and courses in the universities, 
with statistics of attendance, are added. 
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 
The chapter on education in Italy (pp. 543-582) includes comparative 
statistical tables by Dr. Egisto Rossi, author of a work on public 
instruction in the United States. It also contains a reprint of an 
article on the Catholic schools of Rome by His Eminence Cardinal 
Satolli, and university statistics for 1894-95 by Professor Ferraris, of 
the University of Padua. The status of the schools of Leghorn in 1893 
and the scientific and professional associations of Rome are presented 
by recent members of our consular service.! These are followed by a 
résumé of current educational movements to date of 1895, and by his- 
torical data which give the different phases of educational progress. 
In the thesis of Dr. Rossi the growth of infant schools is indicated. 
In 1862 there were 1,673, with 71,054 pupils, which increased to 2,296 in 
1890, with 278,204 pupils. The elementary schools had 885,152 enrolled 
in 1862 and 2,188,930 in 1890. The interest in education manifested 
by the working classes is indicated by the fact that 100,002 persons 
were in attendance in the holiday schools in 1890, compared with 
16,031 in 1862; evening schools, 108,170 students in 1862 to 196,846 
in 1890. There are to-day five times as many students preparing in 
normal schools for the teacher’s profession as were found in 1862. 
State secondary schools (Ginnasi and Licei) have fully three times as 
many students as in the sixties; State technical schools, nine times 
as many students—2,200 in 1862 to 19,219 in 1890 (in 1893 there were 
21,833 students). Students in State technical institutes and in schools 
fitting for the merchant marine increased fivefold in these years. In

                     XXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION,    
   university studies there were about 11,063 students in 1866-67; in 
1894-95 Professor Ferraris points out that there were 23,140 students 
pursuing university courses, over 21,000 being in the faculties, 1,359 in 
the annexed schools for engineering, 577 in veterinary schocls, and 172 
in schools of agriculture annexed to the universities. 
The supreme control of the Catholic schools of Rome is vested in the 
cardinal vicar, but he is assisted by the pontificial commission, appointed 
by the Pope in 1878, and by special committees, each independent of 
the other, but all subject to the pontifical commission. In immediate 
charge are the directors of free and pay schools, a council of direction 
for higher and technical schools, and there are schools belonging to 
religious corporations which are somewhat independent of these com- 
missions, although following their regulations. Normal schools pre- 
pare the teachers needed, and there are numerous secondary and 
technical schools, Higher grade institutions for the study of literature, 
history, and jurisprudence are under charge of men noted for literary 
or scientific attainments. For pupils coming from the provinces there 
are boarding schools. Elementary and industrial instruction is given 
in charitable institutions for orphans and other dependent classes. 
These are in charge of brotherhoods or sisterhoods. There are also 
art, trade, and professional schools brought before the Italian Con- 
gress. Commissions have been appointed for the further promoting of 
manual.and physical training in the schools, to discuss the modifica- 
tions of elementary school programmes so as to do away with “arid 
processes,” and to establish schools complementary to the elementary 
grades.. The subject of examinations for entrance to secondary schools 
has been decided so that pupils holding elementary grade certificates 
(licenza elementare) are not required to pass still other examinations 
before continuing their course in secondary grades. 
REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Chapter XIIE (pp. 583-620) deals with the report of the Royal Com- 
mission on secondary education. The causes that led to the appoint- 
meut of the commission are reviewed briefly and a synopsis of their 
principal recommendations presented. These look to the creation of 
local authorities charged with the distribution of the public funds that 
may be devoted to secondary education, and with authority also to 
secure adequate provision for secondary education within their respec- 
tive provinces and subject to the central authority. In the new order 
this central authority would be raised. to the dignity of an executive 
department presided over by a minister, and would absorb all the edu- 
cational functions of the Government which are now divided between 
the education department, the science and art department, and the 
charity commissioners. An advisory council of professional experts is 
a proposed feature of the central organization. 
Incidentally, the report of the commissioners gives a detailed view
-P-A-G-E-25
     EDUCATION IN POLAND.      
  XXV 
of the present system of secondary instruction in England, the- multi- 
plicity of its agencies, and the strong and weak points in their conduct 
and outcome, 
The bearing of the work of* the commission is made clearer by 
digests of the evidence of the principal witnesses examined by the 
commission. Tere are brought into view the various interests affected 
_ by proposed legislation in this province, and the opinions of represent- 
ative men and women as to the means of securing an effective organi- 
zation of the diverse agencies now engaged in the work without 
crippling them or interfering with their rights. As the testimony on 
these points covered 1,500 octavo pages and included 18,000 questions 
and answers, it was manifestly impossible to reduce the whole to a few 
pages. It was found that the testimony calculated to interest and to 
be understood by an American reader was in general given by persons 
deputed by technical associations, guilds, or school bodies intimately 
connected with the conduct of English elementary or secondary educa- 
tion, and that a running statement of the testimony given by such 
deputies would substantially represent the condition of secondary edu- 
cation in England and the manner in which responsible and informed 
persons thought that whatever was objectionable in those forms of 
education could be remedied. 
Chapter XIV (pp. 621-712) continues the same subject and reprints 
various reports made by persons appointed by the Royal Commission 
to examine certain phases of education. It includes the report of Mr. 
J. J. Findlay on certain features of secondary education in the United 
States. He states that his purpose is to show the merits of our system, 
and his work is of value because it brings our method into comparison 
with English ways of dealing with the same problems. This report is 
followed by the answers to various questions on secondary education 
sent to Canada and the United States, and includes the reply of Presi- 
dent Eliot, of Harvard University, in full. This is followed by Dr. J. G. 
Fitch’s discussion of the training of teachers in England and Mr. M. E. 
Sadler’s report on the leaving examinations as conducted in secondary 
schools in Prussia, a paper of value to us in view of the efforts we are 
making to find a proper adjustment between college and preparatory 
schools. 
EDUCATION IN POLAND. 
Professor Schoenfeld presents a review in Chapter XV (pp. 713-792) 
of higher education in Russian, Austrian, and Prussian Poland. This 
review is introduced by a historical statement dealing with the intel- 
lectual and literary life in Poland while its autonomy was still intact. 
The extent of Poland, the structure, beauty, and strength of its lan- 
guage, the founding of the University of Cracow, the rise of Polish 
schools at the time of the Protestant Reformation, the work of John 
Amos Comenius, the revival and the renationalization of public instrue- 
tion by Stanislas Konarskiin the eighteenth century are traced briefly.

higher education in Russian, Austrian, and Prussian Poland, in which 
the methods and aims of each of these Governments are pointed 
out. Attention has also been given to the materials for the history of

private. 
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND, 
A chapter has been prepared for this report on “Facilities for the 
university education of women in England” (pp. 805-891). This move- 
ment was preceded by the establishment of “local examinations ”— 
first for boys and then for girls—held by the “ delegacy for local exami- 
nations,” which has the business part of all women’s examinations in 
charge. The Oxford Association for the Education of Women makes 
the arrangements for instructing women who desire to be trained at 
Oxford, and by the appointment on its council of representatives from 
women’s colleges it informally licenses these colleges. The first scheme 
for lectures and classes at Oxford dates from 1865; a new plan devel- 
oped in 1873; in 1884 the first university examinations were open to 
women, and in 1893 the educational committee of the Association for 
the Education of Women was formed. Women may attend lecture 
courses at Oxford independent of this association, but their prospects 
are better if they are connected with it. The examinations leading to 
a degree in arts (which at Oxford include law, science, and theology) 
are open to women, but not the medical examinations. The regula- 
tions and studies for the B. A. examinations are fully described. The 
methods of study include university lectures by professors, readers, 
and tutors; also lectures provided by agreement among the different 
colleges, and there are lectures given for each college separately. 
Somerville College, Lady Margaret Hall, and St. Hugh’s Hall are 
described, and their purpose in the education of women indicated. 
The woman movement at the University of Cambridge aimed “to 
place the work of women students on lines exactly parallel to those of 
the men.” In 1881 the women’s colleges—Girton and Newnham (which 
are fully described)—received their first formal acknowledgment from 
the university. Although degrees were refused, students who fulfilled 
certain conditions were admitted to “the previous and the tripos 
examinations.” Such women students as have satisfied the examiners 
in a tripos examination receive a certificate from the university indi- 
cating the conditions of admission to examination. Women are not 
members of the university, but of colleges which, in their corporate 
capacity, are acknowledged by the university and have to submit to 
regulations laid down by the university. The real difference in the 
relative position of the men and women students is that the former 
may use B. A. and M. A., while the women receive only a diploma and 
can not claim a degree. They are admitted to the honors examination, 
but are excluded from the ordinary pass degree. The matter of exam- 
   
-P-A-G-E-27
  AMERICAN MEDICAL SCHOOLS. XXVII 
inations is of the utmost consequence in English universities, the work 
of the classroom being but secondary. The real work at the women’s 
colleges consists in the preparation for final honors examination (or 
triposes), and no student can present himself for a tripes more than 
onee. 
THE EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 
The aim of this chapter (pp. 893-976) is to present the conditions 
governing woman’s education in different countries, as far as such infor- 
mation can be gained from authoritative sources—such as school laws, 
governmental reports, and other official publications. Discussions of 
the latest movements are presented; the date of the opening of foreign 
universities to women and the professions open to them, there and ee 
have been indicated. 
THE CHAUTAUQUAN EDUCATION. 
In his monograph on Chautauqua, a social and educational study 
(Chap. XIX), Prof: H. B. Adams treats this peculiarly American phase 
of university extension and summer school work with a fullness which 
it has never received before. Chautauquais viewed as a social institu- 
tion; its history is traced and its educational value emphasized; a 
third part is devoted to the new Cathelic summer school of Ameriea. 
Dr. Adams’s work is complemented by a check list of American sum- 
mer schools (Part I, Chap. XXXVI), in which the history of the sum- 
mer school is briefly traced., This is followed by a bibliography of the 
subjeet and a list of such schools, with a brief statement of the scope 
of this work, the time of sessions, and the chief officer. 
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 
Chapter XX VI of Part II has been compiled as a general statement 
of the condition of the institutions endowed by the national land 
grants of 1862 and 1890. This statement is preceded by a historical 
review of the early attempts to introduce the subjects of physics, 
chemistry, manual arts, and agriculture. 
AMERICAN MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
Dr. Marcel Baudouin, delegate from the French Government to the 
Chicago Exposition, visited a large number of medical schouls and 
hospitals in the United States, including those as far west as San Fran- 
cisco, Cal., and Portland, Oreg., and afterwards published an elaborate 
report upon the institutions visited. Some extracts from his report are 
presented (Chap. X XTX of Part II) in order to indicate howa competent 
observer, familiar with the conditions of, professional instruction in 
Europe, has been impressed with institutions of like order in America. 
Johns Hopkins Hospital, to which he says only one in Europe can 
be compared in hygienic resources and harmonious arrangement, the
-P-A-G-E-28
    XXVIII REFORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Urban Spital at Berlin, receives a full description. The arrangement 
of this institution was not determined upon until after the presenta- 
tion of many plans by architects and physicians and after many 
months spent by Dr. John 8. Billings in the examination of hospitals 
in France and Germany. The intellectual culture and professional 
knowledge of the nurses, as well as the compensation received by 
them, also elicited comment. 
The Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania was taken as typ- 
ical of the schools exclusively for women, and the medical school of 
the University of Pennsylvania as one of the oldest and most impor- 
tant in the United States. 
Roosevelt and Bellevue hospitals, and Yale, Clark, Harvard, McLean, 
Cornell, Michigan, Colorado, and other schools and hospitals also 
‘receive attention. 
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
The rapidly growing tendency to modify the character of the local 
school community makes of interest a study of the features of the 
school district as it appears in the several States. In Chapter XXXIV of 
Part II the character of the administration of school affairs is given 
for each State, especially with reference to the financial matters of 
each local community. 
THE TRANSPORTATION OF CHILDREN. 
A compendium of information relating to the transportation of chil- 
dren to and from school at the public expense is given in Chapter XX XV 
of Part II. Recourse has been had to transportation in several States 
in order to facilitate the work of consolidation of rural ungraded 
schools. The district system of management of school affairs, which 
was evolved in the laudable attempt to plant a school within the reach 
of every child, encouraged the establishment in thinly populated 
localities of numbers of small and weak schools, often having an aver- 
age attendance of less than ten, sometimes of less than five pupils. 
This undue multiplication of small schools, resulting in a dilution of 
the school resources, has long been recognized as economically waste- 
ful; that such schools are in addition pedagogically inefficient has 
been brought into prominence of late years through the contrast 
afforded by the modern graded school with its improved organization, 
equipment, course of study, methods of instruction, and management, 
and especially its well-trained and well-paid teachers. As the defects 
of the small district schools have become more apparent the tendency 
toward conSolidating them into a system of strong, centrally located 
graded schools has become more pronounced. 
The adoption of the town system of school management in several 
States has paved the way for consolidation; in fact, has been an indis- 
pensable preliminary, by bringing all the schools of each town under

one control. The chief difficulty now in the attempt to make one cen- 
tral school take the place of several scattered ones is to render such a 
union school accessible to all the pupils of the discontinued schools. 
The expedient of transporting at the public expense pupils who may 
live too far to walk has been resorted to on a considerable scale in 
Massachusetts and in a lesser degree elsewhere, and has been in general 
found to work satisfactorily. There is effected a saving of funds, while 
at the same time the children have the advantages of better schools. 
In the chapter to which I have referred have been collected reports of 
State and local school officials detailing their experience in the con- 
veyance of pupils to school, which will be of use to those contemplat. 
ing taking steps in that direction. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO EARLY EDUCATIONAL HISTORY OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
The Rey. A. D. Mayo contributes to the present report three chapters 
(XXX VII-XXXIX, of Part Il) on the early history of the American 
common school. He treats with considerable fullness the history of 
the establishment of State school funds; education in the Northwest 
during the first half century of the Republic (1790-1840), and the Amer- 
ican common school in New England for the same period. 
OLD-FIELD SCHOOLS OF GEORGIA. 
Chapter XLII of Part II contains a sketch of domestic, social, and 
school life in middle Georgia during the period of first settlement by the 
whites, and a description of the schools, known as “old-field schools,” 
down to the founding of academies. In aregion nearest the border of 
civilized and savage existence many were the straits to which the ear- 
liest settlers were subjected in their efforts at society organization, and 
particularly at obtaining for the young even rudimentary education. 
Some of those straits, somewhat peculiar because of remoteness from edu- 
cational centers and other accidents in their condition, are described in 
this chapter. Characteristics, personal and professional, of old-time 
rural schoolmasters; their text-books, methods of teaching; their con- 
stantly varying, yet ever brief sessions; their discipline, direct and 
vicarious; their schoolhouses; their holidays, voluntary and enforced; 
games, dressing, ete., of school attendants. The account herein con- 
tained is founded upon entirely reliable reminiscences of many eminent 
Georgians whose educational beginnings were in those schools. 
THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION. 
The Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Ga., in 
the fall of 1895, was an event which attracted wide attention as a con- 
spicuous example of the enterprise of the new South. The conditions 
seemed at the outset to be extremely unfavorable. The Columbian
-P-A-G-E-30
  XXX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Exposition at Chicago was still so fresh in the mind of every one that 
any similar effort would at once excite comparison with it, and without 
the tremendous resources and prestige of the Chicago undertaking it 
seemed folly to attempt another pretentious exposition so soon. More- 
over, the country was in a state of financial depression that threatened 
disaster to new enterprises, and altogether there seemed little hope of 
ereditable outcome to the affair. But such was the energy with which 
the idea was pushed and such was the public spirit of the people who 
supported it that a measure of success attended the Atlanta Exposi- 
tion that was truly remarkable. It was not directly a financial success. 
Few expositions have been. But it did succeed in advertising the 
cities of the South and the resources of its agriculture and mines. 
The report-of the agent of this Bureau at the exposition is presented 
as Chapter XLIII of Part II. In it will be found a description of the 
exposition in general, a report of the exhibit of the Bureau of Educa- 
tion, and other papers. 
  ENGLISH TEXT-BOOKS ON THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 
Chapter XLIV of Part II deals with English methods of teaching the 
history of the American Revolutionary war, and was prepared in accord 
with the suggestion of the Hon. Samuel Plimsoll, late member of Par- 
liament and widely:known for his efforts to alleviate the condition of 
the sailor. He believes that much ill feeling toward England has been 
engendered by the teachings of the school histories of the United States, 
Teachers of our national history in our schools will compare with inter- 
est the extracts from English text-books here given with the correspond- 
ing passages in our own text-books. 
CONSULAR REPORTS.

  STATE COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEMS. XLUI 
Observations on Table 8.—The “aggregate number of days’ schooling given” to all 
pupils (see column 6), which is the same thing as the aggregate number of days 
attended by all the pupils, has been computed for those States which do not make an 
explicit report of this item by multiplying the average daily attendance of pupils 
by the average length of schcol term in days. 
Conversely, the average length of school term (column 5) for the United States as a 
whole and for each of its geographical divisions has been obtained by dividing the 
aggregate number of days attended by the average daily attendance. 
By this method tho school term of each State, in taking the average, is in fact given 
a weight proportioned to the school attendance of the State, as should be done under 
a correct interpretation of the expression, ‘‘ Average length of school term.” The 
result might more properly be called, ‘Average length of attendance,” which is essen- 
tially what it is desired to know. 
A method in use in some States for finding the average school term, of a county, 
for instance, is to weight the different school terms of the towns or districts the 
county is composed of by the number of schools in each; in other words, the total 
number of days (or months) all the schools of a county were kept is divided by the 
total number of schools to get the average time each ene was kept. So, in finding 
the average term for the State, the school is taken as the unit instead of the pupil, 
the Burean’s method. When the schools differ much in size (number of pupils), as 
they do in all mixed urban and rural systems, varying from some half a dozen to 
500 or more pupils each, the average term obtained by this method varies considera- 
bly from that obtained by the foregoing. The long terms of the large city schools 
not being given their proper weight, the resulting average is too small. The same 
objection applies still more forcibly to weighting the school terms of the different 
counties or towns by the number of school districts in each. 
Still another method is to add tegether the school terms of the different counties 
or towns and divide by the number of such counties or towns; i. e., the simple arith- 
metical mean is taken. A conspicuous example of this oceurs in the Indiana School 
Report of 1894 (p. 572) in the return from Marion County, where it is stated that 
14,193 pupils in Indianapolis attended 185 days, and 856 pupils in West Indianapolis 
attended 160 days, while the average time the whole 15,049 pupils attended is com- 
puted at 172} days, although nearly all (16 out of every 17) attended 185 days. This 
method, if it can be so called, gives altogether too short an average term, and 
nothing can be said in defense of it. It is as if, wishing to get the population 
per square mile of Minnesota and Dakota combined, we said, Minnesota, 9.86; 
Dakota, 0.92; average number of persons per square mile in the combined territory 
(0.92 + 9.86) — 25.39, instead of dividing the total population of the two States 
by the combined area in square miles. 
The “aggregate number of days’ attendance” is a statistical item of the utmost 
simplicity and of great value, about the meaning of which there can be little or no 
difference of opinion. Every teacher's register that records the number of pupils 
present each day in any school, as they all presumably de, contains the data for 
ascertaining it for that school for the school year by the simple process of addition 
or summing up.

RELATIVE GROWTH OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
The question as to the relative growth of public and private schools would seem 
to admit of being settled by a consideration of the past and present statistics of pub- 
But the statistics of private schcol attendance 
are reported by only a few States, and these are for the most part imperfect and
-P-A-G-E-49
  STATE COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEMS. XLIx 
fragmentary. The most complete, and apparently the most reliable, statistics of 
private schools, running through a series of years, are furnished by the annual State 
school reports of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
Rhode Island has taken for about two decades an annual school census, in which 
are reported: (1) The number of children between 5 and 15 years of age, inclusive; 
(2) tho number of these attending Catholic schools; (3) the number attending 
“select” schools (these presumably including all non-Catholic private schools); and 
(4) the number not attending any school. The results at four different epochs are 
as follows:

Total | 100. 00 
  
  During the interval of fourteen years covered by this table the Catholic schools 
have made a gain of 5.48 pupils in every 100 census children. This gain has not 
been at the expense of the public schools, however, as the public schools themselves 
have made a gain of 2.98 pupils in the same interval. Both these classes of schools 
have gained from the ranks of the nonattendants and to a lesser degree from the 
select schools. 
The opposition of the Catholic Church to the public schools is based upon well- 
understood grounds, involving the question of religious instruction according to 
its own creed to the pupils of its own faith as a part of the school course of study. 
This opposition has always existed, and the church will doubtless continue to pur- 
suc its declared policy of establishing and maintaining its own schools, as there is 
no present prospect of any other alternative, the question of division of the school 
funds and of compromise schools having well-nigh ceased even to be discussed in the 
United States generally. Increasing density and aggregation of population and 
larger financial resources are enabling the church to carry out always more effectu- 
ally its policy of educating its own children, and to these circumstances may be 
attributed the gain which has been made in the Catholic schools of Rhode Island, 
That there exists no general dissatisfaction with the public schools on pedagogical 
grounds, or on any grounds that would lead them to be supplanted more or less grad- 
ually by private schools, seems to be established by the figures relating to select 
schools in the foregoing table, which show not only a relative loss in the attendance 
upon these schools, but an absolute decrease of 318 pupils, while the number of 
census children has increased about 21,000, and the public school pupils over 15,000, 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Similar results may be deduced from a consideration of the statistics of the Mas- 
sachusetts reports. Here we have no denominational classification, but a division 
of the nonpublic schools into ‘“‘academies” and “ private schools,” the former class 
probably embracing in a general way the secondary schools, with or without pre- 
paratory departments, and the latter class the puroly elementary schools. Moreover,

all the pupils of each class are given, there being no age limits, as in the ease of 
Rhode Island, so that the number of pupils in school exceeds the total number of 
children 5 to 15 years of age enumerated by the school census. The returns of pri- 
vate school attendance are made in Massachusetts by the local school officials along 
with their other returns, and are not reported by the special census enumerators. 
The results are as follows, taking the same years as before:

Here both classes of nonpublic schools show a gain in attendance as compared 
with the school population; and as the gain is especially marked in the case of the 
elementary (‘‘private”) schools, they having adyanced from 5.17 to 12.07 pupils per 
100 school census children, itis not unreasonable to assume, in the absence of posi- 
tive knowledge, that the same agencies are at work as in the adjoining and similarly 
situated State of Rhode Island, and that the increase in the “ private” school attend- 
ance of Massachusetts is largely due to the growth of the Catholic parochial school 
system. However this may be, there has been no encroachment upon the public 
schools in Massachusetts, which enroll, as compared with the school population, a 
number slightly larger in 1894 than in 1880, viz, 100.07 per 100 census children in 
1894 and 99.82-per 100 in 1880. 
CONNECTICUT. 
In Connecticut the private school attendance can be given only in bulk, without 
classification. ‘The private school attendants and the nonattendants are reported 
by the school census enumerators, and limited to those between 4 and 16 years of 
age, The public school attendance is based upon teachers’ reports, and includes 
pupils of allages. The figures are as follows:

This table would seem to show that the private schools have gained 3.64 pupils 
per 100 census children in the fourteen years, while the nonattendants have increased 
7.63 during the same period, making a total increase in these two classes of 11.27. 
This increase of 11.27 must have been at the expense of the only remaining class, 
i. e., the public schools; but the public schools have lost only 5.09 pupils (of all 
ages) per 100 census children. This inconsistency can proceed only from errors in 
the reports of census enumerators or teachers, or both. In point of fact, the annual
-P-A-G-E-51
  STATE COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEMS. LI 
State school reports covering the early portion of the period embraced in the table 
make frequent complaint of inaccuracies in the school census; that the lists are 
carelessly compiled, ‘are often made without visiting families, upon estimates” 
(Report 1885, p. 24), etc. It is useless to attempt to base upon such data any conclu- 
sions regarding the relative growth of public and private schools, but there are 
certain considerations bearing upon the matter which may be mentioned. 
First. In the case of enumerators making up their lists without visiting familics 
and upon estimates, whether from their own personal knowledge or from hearsay, 
they would assuredly get their best results in the better quarter of cities and towns, 
among the old-established and well-known families of business men, mechanics, ete. 
Among the lower classes of laboring people, on the other hand, including factory 
operatives and others of migratory habits and difficult to keep run of, in obscuro 
quarters and in the slums, there would be more disposition for the enumerators to 
shirk their work, and more difficulty in doing it well if they made an honest effort. 
Now, it is among these latter classes that most of the nonattendants are found, 
especially in Connecticut; and the presumption from the figures and State reports is 
that these nonattendants were not hunted up and reported as fully in 1880 as in 1894. 
There are, therefore, good grounds for surmising that the apparent large increase 
in the ranks of nonattendants arises from imperfect reports in the earlier years. 
Second. What increase there is in the number of nonattendants is probably due, 
in large measure, to the growing indisposition to send children to school at as early 
an age as formerly. This trend of opinion found expression in the Connecticut law 
of 1877, which authorized school visitors to exclude from school, when they saw fit, 
children below the age of 5 years. Six years is now becoming generally recognized 
as the proper age for a child to begin his school education. If we take the children 
from 8 to 14 years of age only, the number of nonattendants will be found to be 
decreasing. In Connecticut in 1884 there were 2,841 nonattendants from 8 to 14 
years of age, or 1.90 per cent of the school population; in 1894 there were only 2,292 
or 1.35 per cent of the school population. 
Third. This withdrawal of young children from school may also explain in part 
the comparative loss in attendance on the public schools; but there can be no doubt 
that this apparent loss is occasioned in part by former exaggerated reports of enroll- 
ment, ‘The same public school pupils used to be, and still are in many localities in 
the United States, enrolled in two or more towns, schools, or even classes in the 
same school. It was only in the seventies that Massachusetts began to exclude 
duplicate enrollments from the reports of school attendance, and it is highly proba- 
ble that the practice of registering pupils more than once existed in Connecticut as 
elsewhere, and if the figures for the earlier years in the foregoing table were cor- 
rected for duplicate registration they would probably be somewhat lessened, even 
to the extent of showing a gain for the late years, instead of loss. 
With these considerations in mind, it would be hazardous to assert that the figures 
prove that the private schools have been gaining in Connecticut at the expense of 
the public.

CHAPTER I. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
The single constant factor observable in the statistics of city schools 
is progressive increase in numbers. It is fitting, therefore, that an 
examination be made into the facts and conditions of growth of the 
cities themselves in order to arrive at a clear understanding of the 
growth of the schools. 
Beginning with five cities of 8,000 inhabitants, with an aggregate 
population of 108,750 in 1790, there has been an increase at every cen- 
sus, both in the total urban population and in the number of cities, 
until at the last census, in 1890, there were reported 448 cities, with 
18,284,385 inhabitants. In 1790 the cities comprised 2.77 per cent of 
the whole population of the country; in 1890 that ratio had grown to 
29.20 per cent.! 
The conclusion to be drawn from this is undoubtedly that we are 
becoming as a nation less and less agricultural and more given to 
those diversified occupations for the pursuit of which the conditions 
presented by cities are necessary concomitants. 
This change in the general character of the population is not peculiar 
to America, but is noticeable in even a greater degree in Europe, where 
in some cases, as in Scotland, the change amounts almost to a social 
revolution. 
The prime cause for this extensive modification of social conditions 
is due in general to the unprecedented advance made in the last cen- 
tury in the invention and use of machinery, by which productive power 
has been enormously increased. This operates both to lessen the popu- 
lation of the country and.to increase that of the city. By the use of 
improved labor-saving machinery one man may to-day cultivate more 
land and raise larger crops than were possible to ten men a century 
ago, when most of the work of the farm was done by hand. Even 
to day, in some parts of the country where the conditions are still some-

  4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
what primitive, the standard allowance is a mule and two hands to 60 
acres. But,as Edward Atkinson has shown, on the great farms of 
North Dakota, where machinery is used to the greatest possible extent, 
the labor of one man is equivalent to the care of 260 acres. Even here 
we have the difference between 30 and 260 acres per man. 
The same agency, machinery, at the same time that it has lessened 
the number of men required for a given amount of farm work, has 
provided for the surplus laborers by transferring to the city many of 
the former occupations of the farm; the manufacture of implements, 
spinning, weaving, and the like were formerly the work of the farmer 
and his family. But with the use of improved tools, which are not 
available to the farmer, and with the help of the steam engine these 
things may now be done in the city so much more cheaply and expedi- 
tiously that the farmer finds it to his interest to confine himself almost 
wholly to the cultivation of the soil and the production of the raw mate- 
tial, and to buy manufactured products from the town. Thus it happens 
that not only is labor highly specialized and manufacturing divorced 
from agriculture, but the importance and volume of trade and transpor- 
tation are vastly augmented. Other changes in this general direction 
conduce to the concentration of people in the cities, in which nearly 
all occupations not directly concerned with the production of raw mate- 
rial may be pursued more conveniently and advantageously than in the 
sparsely settled rural communities. 
The aggregation of people in close contact with each other in itself 
gives rise to new needs that must be met by the establishment of other 
industries, giving employment to still more people, who must also live 
in the cities. The same density of population makes possible greater 
combinations for education, business, or amusement than would be 
practicable in the country. The graded school, the daily newspaper, 
the library, the theater, the opera, and many other agencies that add 
to the pleasure of living and to the cultivation of the mind attain their 
highest development in the city, and some of them can exist nowhere 
else. Such attractions lure men to the communities in which they exist 
and indirectly lead to the multiplication of industries, for men unable 
to find a place in those already existing invent new ones in order to be 
near the attractions they desire, and by presenting novelties create a 
demand for them. Thus cities increase of their own momentum, and 
in their development grow from mere appendages to surrounding 
agricultural regions into great centers of dominating influence. 
The agricultural districts, in turn, feel the reaction from the growth 
of the cities. The demand for provisions is greater, because there are 
more people who must buy them. Machinery has reduced the cost of 
manufactured articles; they are used more freely and in greater quan- 
tities, so that the market for raw material is extended. It follows, 
then, since more of farm products are required, that there is not 
usually any decrease in the number of people in the country surround-
-P-A-G-E-63
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. yy 
ing the cities, though there may be, and in fact usually is, a great 
change among individuals. But such is the facility of transportation 
from one part of the world to another that if the territory contiguous 
to a city is not favorable to agriculture because of poverty of soil, 
adverse climate, or other reasons, it is not able to compete even in the 
production of raw materials with localities more favored by nature 
even though the latter may be far removed from the market. This is 
true of Scotland and of some parts of New England, where there has 
been an actual decrease in rural population. 
These general statements apply to the United States as to all the 
rest of the civilized world. But in addition there are other causes 
that have produced the remarkable extension of city influences in this 
country. 
It was formerly the policy of England to use her colonies merely as 
feeders to the mother country, and to encourage their prosperity only 
so far as it added to the immediate welfare of England and for that 
purpose only. Manufactures which would compete with home manu- 
factures were forbidden, and commerce, except that conducted by 
means of English ships, was prohibited. This hampering of colonial 
industries began as early as 1651 with the navigation act, and con- 
tinued to the Revolution, to which it was one of the contributing causes. 
Under the influence of such a policy, agriculture was practically the 
only industry freely open to the American colonists. The people were 
widely scattered and the cities insignificant, even when compared to 
the small population, for many of those city functions which should 
have been performed by American cities were reserved for the cities of 
England. There were only 32,328 people in New York in 1790, and 
28,522 in Philadelphia, the largest cities in the country. Boston had 
18,038 inhabitants, Charleston 16,359, and Baltimore 13,503. These 
were the only places worthy the name of cities according to the 
accepted definition of the term, for the next in size, Salem, Mass., had 
only 7,921. 
Almost immediately after the removal of the baleful influence of the 
English colonial policy the cities began to develop, and their first 
impetus may be ascribed primarily to the proper assumption of functions 
clearly their own. New York speedily became a city of importance, 
and in thirty years had quadrupled in size. Philadelphia, Boston, and 
Charleston grew less rapidly, but Baltimore’s growth was proportion- 
ally as great as that-of New York. Villages became cities, and in 1820 
there were ten more cities than in 1790, 
It is to be remembered that even at the present time this country is 
in its formative stage. The conditions under which the industries 
must finally be pursued are still unsettled in many parts of the country, 
for the pursuits characteristic of whole States are those of a pioneer 
people. To be sure, this is less true now than at any previous period, 
for with increasing development come more settled conditions. Buta

  sufficient portion of our territory remains unoccupied, or only partially 
settled, to justify as true to-day, though in a less degree, the statements: 
that may be made as to conditions of progress in the past, and vice 
versa. The following therefore may be taken as a type of the growth 
of American cities. 
Agriculture is usually the only industry open to the first permanent 
settlers inanew country. The difficulties of obtaining supplies and the 
impossibility of profitable manufacture or trade when the population 
is sparse compel the settler to rely upon his own exertions in tilling the 
soil for the simple necessities of life. He therefore chooses for his home 
the place promising the richest return for his labor. The most desir- 
able lands are thus first occupied, then the less desirable. Later comes 
the store for the exchange of products and the sale of articles not 
produced on the farm. Then simple mechanical industries, as a black- 
smith shop, a mill, or a wagon shop, are established; a chureh and school 
are built, a post-office opened, and a villageisbegun. If the community 
is prosperous the village speedily grows. New stores are added, a 
weekly newspaper begun, more churches are built, and other industries 
are started. Under favorable conditions, such as proximity to a navi- 
gable river or railroad, and especially if at the junction of two or more 
transportation lines, the growth is all the more sure and steady. If 
the conditions for manufacturing are also especially favorable, further 
development into a city is reasonably certain. The first articles manu- 
factured are generally those required in the immediate neighborhood, 
but gradually the field is broadened and. goods are sold in distant com- 
munities less favorably situated for the manufacture of those particular 
articles, special facilities in transportation making a desirable cen- 
ter of distribution, and proximity to mines or to great forests equally 
insuring development. 
But the growth of the cities isnot at the expense of the country sur- 
rounding them, for it is at first the result of the growth and needs of 
that country. Their subsequent growth, resulting from the extensive 
useof machinery and from their own momentum, as previously deseribed, 
does no injury to the country but rather aids it. Many of the best and 
most energetic of those from the country are drawn into the city, but 
a balance in numbers, though not necessarily in character, is struck by 
others who go from the city to the country, or who come from other 
sections and from foreign countries. 
The city absorbs an undue share of foreign immigration, and its pep- 
ulation grows proportionally much faster than that of the country, 
because comparatively few persons are needed for farm work, and, asa 
rule, that number is all but supplied when the building of the city is 
seareely begun. Still newer countries and fresher lands are open to 
those who desire to begin anew as farmers, and in these days of rapid 
transportation and cheap freights distance from city markets is of small 
account as compared with cheaper and more fertile lands, except in a
-P-A-G-E-65

limited class of products, such as vegetables and the like, which must 
be sold immediately. 
This illustrates the growth typical of American cities. The country 
is dotted over with communities in all the various stages of develop. 
ment, and each year a considerable number of them attain the size and 
importance sufficient to justify them in being considered as cities in all 
discussion of urban questions. It is to these new cities to a large 
extent that the wonderful urban growth shown by the censuses is due. 
Even before they could be ranked as cities they were in existence as 
villages, or centers of varying degrees of importance, and contained 
the germs of the future cities. 
To determine the relative growth of these communities and of the 
country at large it would be necessary to compare the relative impor- 
tance of the communities as they now exist with their relative importance 
at any past period with which the comparison is desired. But since 
we wish to consider cities only, this comparison would not be desirable, 
for it would require us to consider in the past period many communities, 
which, though cities in posse, were not yet cities in any true sense. A 
better comparison which has the same significance is between those 
which might properly be called cities at the former period and the 
same cities at the latter period. 
This means simply tracing the growth for a stated time of all cities 
in the United States that have been cities during all that time. 
The question is not whether the average character of the population 
is changing, but as to whether cities, after they become cities, grow at 
a rate disproportionate to the growth of the country at large. 
The growth of new cities does not affect the propriety of the com- 
parison, because they do not in general alter the relative importance of 
the older cities. The old cities in general assume new functions and 
become centers of the new centers. Their influence remains predomi- 
nant in financial, commercial, and even in social affairs. 
The table below was constructed to present comparisons of the cities 
of four periods, namely, 1790, 1820; 1840, and 1850, with the same cities 
as they exist to-day. The census of 1790 was the first taken after the 
adoption of the Constitution; that of 1820 was sufficiently removed 
to show the tendencies of independence, as opposed to those of colonial 
dependence, in regard to the matter in hand; that of 1840 marks the 
half century between the first and the last census, and that of 1850 
was the first taken after the territorial acquisition of 1848, which made 
the United States what it is at present, if Alaska be excepted. As the 
table shows, the 5 cities which in 1790 had in their limits 2.77 per cent 
of the whole population of the country, in 1890 had 5.59 per cent of 
the same. Their relative importance had doubled. By 1820 there had 
been sufficient time for the cities to come into their own just inherit- 
ance; the 15 cities at that date comprised 4.73 per cent of the popula- 
tion; in 1890 the same 15 cities had 7.39 per cent of the population.
-P-A-G-E-66
  8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
  They had increased in importance by 56 per cent; their growth was 
over one-half greater than that of the entire country. 
Similarly, in 1840 there were 53 cities whose population was 8.73 per 
cent of the whole; in 1890 it was 13.10 per cent, a relative increase of 
almost exactly 50 per cent. In this case the urban growth was just 
one-half more, relatively, than that of the whole United States. The 
proportion is less in the comparison of the 91 cities of 1850 with the 
same cities of 1890, for at the earlier date 12.58 per cent of the popula- 
tion was in those cities, while at the later period the proportion was 
17.51 per cent; relatively, they had grown two-fifths more than the 
entire country. 
If we put the same statements in another form, it appears that the 
5 cities which have existed as cities for one hundred years have in that 
time increased 100 per cent in relative importance as judged by popu- 
lation; the 15 cities that have existed as such for seventy years or more 
have in the last seventy years increased 56 per cent in relative impor- 
tance; those (53) which have been cities for fifty years or more have in 
the last fifty years grown relatively 50 per cent; and those (91) which 
have existed as cities for forty years or more have increased in relative 
importance by 40 per cent in the last forty years. 
The coincidences in these figures are striking. With the exception 
of the comparison based on 1820, the percentages are the same as the 
number of years included in the comparison. This would seem to indi- 
cate that the annual rate of growth of cities is greater by 1 per cent 
per annum than the corresponding rate of growth of the nation, and 
that the excess increases in arithmetical ratio instead of geometrical 
ratio. This, however, is probably not strictly true; the several ratios 
mentioned are not properly comparable with each other, since they 
represent different sets of cities. But naturally the true ratio would 
lie not far from that shown by the calculation presented.

1              From the discussions of the preceding pages the meaning of the 
summaries in the following tables may be more readily understood. 
It is intended to present each year the school statistics of all the 
cities in the United States that have over 8,000 inhabitants, with the 
summaries of the same. This first involves the preparation of a list of 
such cities—an easy task if the population of each is known. But 
that is the case only once in every ten years, when the United States 
census is taken. It would be obviously wrong to use the same list for 
ten years, because, as we have already seen, constant additions are 
being made to the number of cities. It is necessary, therefore, to con- 
stantly revise the list, and in this Bureau this is done whenever 
evidence appears to indicate the need of revision. School statistics 
are gathered from all communities of over 4,000 inhabitants, and when 
the reports from any community show that the schools have grown 
beyond the point which might be expected to be reached by a place 
having less than 8,000, further inquiry is made into the conditions of
-P-A-G-E-69
  ae CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 11 
growth of the place, noting especially the ratio between its population 
and its school enrollment in 1890, and if the result of the investigation 
justifies it the name of the community is at once transferred to the 
list of cities and its statistics tabulated in that category. 
Naturally, the number of additions made each year to the list is not 
uniform and the rate of increase in the same statistical item varies 
considerably from one year to another, as the tables for the several 
years show. It is, therefore, not practicable to institute comparisons 
between different years on the basis of the figures presented. But 
since all the cities are represented in the totals, either by accurate 
figures or by estimates believed to be reliable, it is perfectly safe to 
compare the several items for the same year; or the ratios resulting 
from such comparisons may be compared with similar ratios for another 
year. For example, the reported enrollment for 1893-94 was greater 
than that for 1892-93 by 8.68 per cent, while the reported enrollment 
for 1894-95 was only 5.56 per cent more than that for 1893-94; the 
corresponding increase between 1891-92 to 1892-93 was 4.86 per cent. 
Actually there was no such difference in the rate of increase; the 
variation was caused by the fact that in one year (1892--93) the facili- 
ties for investigating the growth of cities were greater than before. 
More cities than usual were added to the list, and consequently the 
apparent increase was greater than usual. All this indicates nothing 
more than a difference in the collection of statistics. 
The average of these yearly rates of increase in a general way 
approximates the true rate of increase, but not with sufficient accuracy 
for precise comparisons. These are possible only in census years, and 
then for ten-year periods only. 
But in 1892-93 the ratio of average attendance to enrollment was 
71.9 per cent; in 1893-94 it was 72.9 per cent, and in 1894-95, 73.6 per 
cent. These quantities are properly comparable, for even though the 
number of cities represented be different, the ratios developed are 
presumably not affected by that difference. The attendance was 
undoubtedly more regular in 1893-94 than in 1892-93, and still more 
regular in 1894-5, Similar comparisons may be made between other 
ratios in the same way. 
Then the enrollment in public schools increased from 1893-94 to 
1894-95 by 5.56 per cent, and under the same statistical conditions 
the private and parochial schools increased by 2.72 per cent. These 
items are comparable, and the inference is that the public schools have 
grown more rapidly than the private schools. 
Table 2 is designed to present opportunity for comparisons of the 
kind last described; Table 5 for comparisons of the previous kind.

  CHAPTER II. 
STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The number of students receiving secondary instruction in institu- 
tions reporting to the United States Bureau of Education for the 
scholastic year 1894-95 was 539,712, an increase of 59,354 over the 
number reported for the year 1893-94. This is probably in excess of 
the actual increase in the number of students, as allowance must be 
made for the addition of several hundred high schools to the lists. 
While some of these are newly established schools, others have been 
in existence for a year or two, but they reported to this office for the 
first time in 1895. These 539,712 secondary students were distributed 
among eight classes of institutions as follows: 
   
      In public high schools 350, 099

Of the total number above enumerated 361,370 were in public insti- 
tutions and 178,342 in private institutions. In addition to those 
counted in the three classes of public institutions there were many 
others pursuing secondary studies in the common schools of the 
country. In many States, and particularly in the States where high 
schools are few, in almost every public elementary school one or more 
students may be found pursuing certain secondary studies. In most 
of the States these are not reported as secondary students to the State 
authorities, but are counted with the elementary pupils. This Bureau 
is without the data necessary for a close estimate of the number of 
such secondary students in the elementary schools. Probably the 
number is not less than 50,000 nor more than 100,000. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
More than 50 pages of the Education Report for 1893-94 were devoted 
to a statistical review of secondary education. The statistical sum- 
maries of that year were discussed with minuteness. As the tables for 
19
-P-A-G-E-78
20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
1894-95 are in practically the same form, and no new facts have been 
brought to light, a lengthy discussion of the statistics presented in this 
report is not deemed necessary. <A brief explanation of the tabular 
summaries will be sufficient. 
The statistics here considered relate directly to secondary schools, 
i.e. to public high schools and private high schools and academies. 
Secondary students in other institutions are not considered at present 
because information concerning them is not complete. For the past 
six years this Bureau has annually collected information directly from 
several thousand public and private high schools. The forms of inquiry, 
while improved from year to year, have followed the same lines, seek- 
ing to bring out and make prominent certain facts. The number of 
schools reporting increased from 4,158 in 1890 to 6,892 in 1895. There 
was also improvement in the manner of collecting information, and 
year by year the work of compilation has gained in thoroughness. The 
continuity of the statistics has remained unbroken while they have 
gained in accuracy from year to year. 
The following table is a condensed review of the statistics of public 
and private high schools for the past six years:

In this chapter will be found tables summarizing the principal sta- 
tistics gathered from the 6,892 secondary schools, while in Part IV of 
this report the information concerning each schoolis given in detail. 
Tables 1 to 10 in this chapter relate to public high schools in all the 
States; Tables 11 to 22 relate to private high schools, while Tables 23 
to 31 combine the statistics of public and private high schools dealing 
with the institutions as secondary schools simply. 
Pusiic H1iGH SCHOOLS. 
In these tables the statistics are summarized by States and then by 
divisions. The geographical divisions are purely arbitrary and are 
used here for the sake of uniformity, the statistics of the Census Office 
having been compiled in this form. For the purposes of this Bureau a 
ditferent grouping of the States would be better. For example, the 
South Atlantic and the South Central divisions might be thrown 
together and the State of Missouri included with them. This grouping 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 21 
would be more convenient to those who wish to study the progress of 
education in the former slave States during the past twenty years. 
Such a study is not contemplated for this report. 
For the year ending June, 1895, the number of public high schools 
reporting to this office was 4,712. It is believed that this is within a 
few hundred of the total number of public high schools in operation 
during the year. Many so-called high schools were not included in 
the list for the reason that they had not reached the ordinary standard 
for secondary schools as indicated in the form of inquiry sent out from 
this office. A secondary student was there defined as one pursuing at 
least two of the recognized secondary studies. The secondary studies 
named included Latin, Greek, French, German, algebra, geometry, trig- 
onometry, astronomy, physics, physical geography, geology, zoology, 
botany, physiology, rhetoric, English literature, and history. 
A reference to Table 1 will show that the 4,712 public high schools 
were distributed in the five divisions as follows: North Atlantic, 1,156; 
North Central, 2,424; South Atlantic, 378; South Central, 542; West- 
ern, 212. Ohio alone had 474 high schools, New York 332, Illinois 305, 
Iowa 298, Michigan 271, Indiana 270, Pennsylvania 256, and Massachu- 
setts 216. In the South Central Division Texas had 156 high schools 
and in the South Atlantic Georgia had 118. 
The 4,712 public high schools had 14,122 teachers employed in in- 
structing secondary students. This number does not include those 
teachers whose time was wholly devoted to the instruction of elemen- 
tary pupils in the lower grades attached to independent high schools. 
The average number of teachers to a school was 3, as shown in the first 
column of Table 23, the average number for the North Atlantic Division 
being 3.8 and for the South Central 2.3. 
There were 350,099 secondary students in the public high sehools of 
the United States. A glance at the seventh column of Table 1 will 
show how those students were distributed by States and by divisions. 
The North Atlantic had 109,591, the North Central 173,158, the South 
Atlantic 20,480, the South Central 28,064, and the Western Division 
18,806. Ohio stands at the head of the list with 32,597; New York fol- 
lows with 32,489, and Massachusetts is third with 27,053. Texas leads 
the South with 9,087 secondary students; Georgia is next with 5,556, 
and ‘Tennessee follows with 4,766. 
Of the 350,099 secondary students 206,022 were females and 144,077 
males. The per cent of females was 58.85 and of males 41.15, as shown 
in Table 7. This proportion is practically maintained in each of the 
five divisions, the South Atlantic Division alone showing as high a 
percentage as 42.05 for male students. In Nevada the percentage of 
male students was 34.16, the lowest shown for any State. 
The number of colored secondary students in the public high schools 
was 4,622, as shown in the tenth column of Table1. There were 795 
in the schools of the North Atlantic Division, 2,046 in the North
-P-A-G-E-80
  22 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1894-95. 
Central, 1,020 in the South Atlantic, 715 in the South Central, and 46 
in the Western Division. 
From the last column of Table 1 it would appear there were 1,264,464 
pupils in the elementary departments connected with the public high 
schools. This number is of little value because the question in rela- 
tion to pupils below the high-school grades was misunderstood by many 
of the high-school principals. The result was that in many eases all 
the children in the village schools were counted. The question was 
intended to apply to independent high schools only. 
Table 2 shows that 48,146 secondary students in the public high 
schools were preparing for college. This was nearly 14 per cent of the 
whole number. Of these 26,370 were preparing for classical courses 
and 21,776 for scientific courses, 7.53 per cent for the former and 6,22 
for the latter. In the North Atlantic Division 14.81 per cent of the 
students were preparing for college, in the North Central 11.79 per 
cent, in the South Atlantic 13.40 per cent, in the South Central 19.45 
per cent, and in the Western Division 17.36 per cent. A comparison 
of the fourth and fifth columns of Table 7 will show marked variations 
in the proportions between classical and scientific students in the sev- 
eral divisions. In the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and South Cen- 
tral divisions the per cent of classical students is greater, while in the 
North Central and Western divisions the per cent of scientific students 
is greater. Placing the classical first, the proportions are as follows: 
9.07 to 5.74 per cent in the North Atlantic, 10.68 to 2.72 in the South 
Atlantic, 12.15 to 7.30 in the South Central, 5.56 to 6.23 in the North 
Central, and 6.29 to 11.07 in the Western Division. This of course 
indicates that the East and the South lean toward the classical train- 
ing, while the Northwest and West incline toward the education in the 
sciences. The contrasts between the numbers in the two courses are 
still more marked in individual States. In Rhode Island the per cent 
of students preparing for the college classical course was 22.52, and the 
per cent preparing for the college scientific course was only 4.17. In 
South Carolina the corresponding percentages were 22.95 and 6.62. 
On the other hand, in Minnesota the per cent of classical preparatory 
students was only 4.89 as against 20.55 per cent of scientific prepara- 
tory students. 
The number of graduates from the public high schools at the close 
of the school year 1895 was 42,393, or 12.11 per cent of the whole num 
ber of secondary students. The number of male graduates was 15,158 
and of female graduates 27,235. The per cent of male graduates to 
the total number of male students was 10.52, while 13.21 per cent of the 
female students in attendance were graduated. In the ninth column of 
Table 2 will be found the number of graduates in each State. Thecor- 
responding percentages are found in the sixth column of Table 7. It 
is noted that in the District of Columbia 17.63 per cent of the secondary 
students were in the graduating class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 23 
Of the 42,393 students graduating, 11,903 were preparing for college, 
as may be seen from the twelfth column of Table 2. This number was 
28.08 per cent of the total number graduating, as shown in the seventh 
column of Table 7. The percentages for the several States present 
strong contrasts when compared. For example, in Mississippi 85.98 
per cent of the graduates were college preparatory students, while in 
Massachusetts the per cent was only 22.94, and in the District of 
Columbia only 4.50. 
The last column of Table 2 shows that there were 5,812 students in 
the public high schools receiving instruction in military tactics—3,843 
in the North Atlantic Division, 375 in the South Atlantic, 172 in the 
South Central, 1,210 in the North Central, and 212 in the Western 
Division. 
STUDENTS AND STUDIES. 
The numbers of public high school students pursuing certain studies 
are given in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the corresponding percentages 
in Tables 8 and 9. The four former tables should be considered in con- 
nection with the two latter. Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 show the numbers 
of students, male and female, in each State studying Latin, Greek, 
French, German, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, physics, 
chemistry, physical geography, geology, physiology, psychology, rhet- 
oric, and history other than that of the United States. 
Latin.—Of the 350,099 secondary students in the public high schools, 
43.97 per cent studied Latin, 153,950 in all, 60,777 males and 93,173 
females. In the North Atlantic Division 42.64 per cent studied this 
language; in the South Atlantic, 63.33 per cent; in the South Central, 
48.48 per cent; in tke North Central, 41.55 per cent, and in the Western 
Division, 46.24 per cent. North Carolina shows the largest percent- 
age, 83.12, and Wisconsin the smallest, 21.61, leaving the Territory of 
Arizona out of the list. It is somewhat remarkable that the two 
Northern divisions show the smallest percentages of students pursuing 
the classic Latin. 
Greeck.—F rom an inspection of the sixth column of Table 3 it will be 
seen that 10,859 students in the public high schools studied Greek— 
6,361 males and 4,498 females. The students in Greek comprised 3.10 
per cent of the whole number. In the North Atlantic Division the per 
eent was 6.15, and in the North Central 1.36. In Rhode Island the 
per cent was 11.75, in Maine 13.41. From Delaware, West Virginia, 
Oklahoma, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, 
Nevada, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon there were no Greek students 
reported. Florida reported only 1, South Dakota 2, and Utah 5. 
French.—The number of students studying French was 22,813, or 6.52 
per cent of the whole number. In the North Atlantic Division the per 
cent was 14.21, in the South Atlantic 9.52, in the South Central 3.03, in 
the North Central 2.14, and in the Western Division 3.97. The highest
-P-A-G-E-82
24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
  percentage in any State was 36.75, in Massachusetts, and the next 32.79, 
in Louisiana. 
German.—The German language was studied by 39,901 students, 
15,235 males and 24,666 females. The per cent for the entire United 
States was 11.40. The percentage for the North Atlantic Division was 
13.52, for the South Atlantic 13.06, for the South Central 4.22, for the 
North Central 10.84, and for the Western Division 13.12. The highest 
percentages were in the District of Columbia and in Maryland, 29.84 
and 29.83, respectively. 
Algebra.—Of the total 350,099 secondary students, 189,988, or 54.27 
per cent, were studying algebra. The male students in algebra num- 
bered 79,524, and the female students 110,464. The South Central 
Division leads with 66.56 per cent, the South Atlantic is next with 65.99 
per cent, the Western Division had 58.88, the North Central 52.78, and 
the North Atlantic 50.48. 
Geometry.—More than 25 per cent of the students had geometry as 
the second mathematical study. There were 36,078 males and 52,624 
females, or a total of 88,702. In the North Atlantic Division 25.80 per 
cent studied geometry, in the South Atlantic 32.38, in the South Central 
28.77, in the North Central 22.93, in the Western Division 32; for the 
whole United States 25,34, 
Trigonometry.—Only 8,868 students included trigonometry in their 
courses of study, 4,160 males and 4,708 females. The per cent was 2.53, 
although in the two Southern divisions the percentages were 7.49 
and 6.92. 
Astronomy.—tIn the public high schools astronomy is classed as a 
science study. It was pursued by 16,770 students in 1895, or 4.79 per 
cent of the whole number. 
Physics.—The number of students in physics was 79,720, the males 
numbering 33,450 and the females 46,270. The per cent of students 
in this branch was 22.77 for the whole country, the two Southern divi- 
sions leading with 30.45 and 29.97, respectively. 
Ohemistry.—This branch of science claimed only 32,024 students, or 
9.15 per cent of the whole number. The Western Division had 14.22 
per cent of its students in chemistry. 
Physical geography.—tThe number studying physical geography was 
83,642, the males numbering 35,293 and the females 48,349. The per- 
centage to the total number of secondary students was 23.89, the South 
Central Division leading with 29.78, the Western Division reporting 
only 15.18 per cent in physical geography. 
Geology.—Five per cent of the high-school students studied geology, 
7,182 males, 10,306 females, a total of 17,488. In the South Central 
Division the per cent was 7.80, and in the North Atlantic 6.25. 
Physiology.—The science study claiming the largest number of stu- 
dents was physiology. The number in this branch was 104,862, or 
29.95 per cent of the total. The males numbered 44,274 and the
-P-A-G-E-83
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 25 
females 60,588. In the South Central Division the per cent was as 
high as 39.15 and in the Western Division as low as 16.75. In Florida 
the per cent was 54.40 and in Alabama 52.76. In Vermont the per 
cent was 15.20 and in Rhode Island 4.42. 
Psychology.—The number of students studying psychology was 9,606, 
or 2.74 per cent of the whole number. It is noticeable that the highest 
per cent, 5.77, was in the South Central Division, and the next highest, 
3.29, was in the South Atlantic Division. In Alabama the per cent was 
16.97. 
Rhetoric.—More than 32 per cent of the students studied rhetoric, 
45,429 males and 66,776 females, making a total of 112,205. The West- 
ern Dfvision was in the lead with a percentage of 43.91, the South Cen- 
tral had 39.04 per cent, the South Atlantic 36.40, the North Central 
32.15, and the North Atlantic 27.26. 
History.—The number of students reading history other than United 
States history was 120,201, or 34.33 per cent of the whole number. In 
the Western Division the per cent was 48.90, in the South Atlantic 
48.61, in the South Central 42.11, in the North Atlantic 34.89, and the 
North Central 29.45. 
EQUIPMENT AND INCOME. 
An inspection of Table 10 will enable the reader to form an estimate 
of the amount of money necessary to keep in operation the 4,712 public 
high schools of the United States. It is very difficult to collect statis- 
tics of school finances. This is particularly true of public high schools 
for the reason that so many of them are parts of city school systems 
whose officials do not keep separate accounts of the expenditures for 
secondary instruction. 
The aggregate value of buildings and grounds, etc., is given as 
$78,026,394. Only 3,858 of the 4,712 principals furnished figures for 
this item, and in most cases the figures furnished were only estimates. 
However, there is reason to believe that $78,026,394 is a fair valuation 
of the property of the 3,858 public schools. 
The number of public high schools reporting libraries was 3,288, and 
the aggregate number of volumes reported was 1,838,946, There were 
741 of these libraries having more than 500 volumes each, and of these 
437 had more than 1,000 volumes each. 
Replies were received from only 2,563 of the 4,712 schools in response 
to the inquiry as to the amounts of appropriations received from State, 
county, or city. The aggregate amount reported was only $7,719,199. 
It is believed that a large part of the $4,060,262 given in column 11 of 
Table 10 as “amount received from other sources and unclassified” more~ 
properly belongs in column 4. 
As shown in the seventh column, 2,849 schools received from tuition 
and other fees $1,018,631. 
Only 331 schools received an income from productive funds, and the 
amounts received aggregated $710,705.
-P-A-G-E-84
  26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Of the 4,712 schools, only 3,549 reported the total amounts received. 
These aggregated $13,508,797. Of this large sum, $3,696,637 was 
reported from the North Atlantic Division, $732,045 from the South 
Atlantic, $1,220,688 from the South Central, $6,863,021 from the North 
Central, and $996,406 from the Western Division. 
PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In public and private high schools in 1895 there were 468,446 second- 
ary students. Of these about 25 per cent, or 118,347, were in private 
high schools and academies. The number of such schools was 2,180, 
or nearly 32 per cent of the total number of secondary schools. , 
The statistics of private high schools and academies are summarized 
in Tables 11 to 22. Tables 11 to 20 correspond in form to Tables 1 to 
10 of the public high school summaries, and the two series can be 
easily compared, column by column. 
Table 11 shows that in the 2,180 private high schools there were 
8,559 (3,991 males and 4,568 females) teachers instructing secondary 
students. In the two southern divisions the number of female teachers 
is not so greatly in excess of the number of male teachers as in the two 
northern divisions. 
In the private high schools there were 57,354 male secondary stu- 
dents and 60,993 female, the per cent of males being 48.46. In the pub- 
lic high schools the percentage of males was only 41.15. In the private 
high schools there were 113,878 elementary pupils—51,761 males and 
62,117 females. 
The number of students preparing for college in the private high 
schools was 32,051. Of these, 20,477 were preparing for the classical 
course and 11,574 for a scientific course. The per cent of college pre- 
paratory students was 27.08, the classical preparatory being 17.30 per 
cent and the scientific preparatory 9.78 per cent. In the public high 
schools 13.75 per cent of the secondary students were preparing for 
college, 7.53 per cent for the classical course, and 6.22 for a scientific 
course. 
The number of graduates from private high schools in 1895 was 
11,960, or 10.11 per cent of the whole number. (See Tables 12 and 17.) 
The number was divided almost equally between the sexes, there being 
6,052 male and 5,908 female graduates. 
The number of college preparatory students in the graduating classes 
was 5,733, or 47.93 per cent of the whole number of graduates. Of 
these college preparatory graduates 3,724 were males and 2,009 females, 
‘In the public high schools the per cent of college preparatory students 
in the graduating classes was 28.08, and largely more than half of the 
number were females. 
A comparison is made in Table 23 between certain public and private 
high school statistics.

STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 2E 
STUDENTS AND STUDIES. 
The numbers of students in the private high schools pursuing certain 
studies are given in Tables 13, 14, 15, and 16, and the corresponding 
percentages are given in Tables 18 and 19. These tables, when com- 
pared with Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, present rather marked contrasts 
between the public and private high schools in regard to certain 
secondary studies. 
In the publie high schools 43.97 per cent of the secondary students 
studied Latin. Inthe private secondary schools the percent was 43.14, 
In the public high school the per cent studying Greek was only 3.15, 
while in the private high school it was 9.55. In French the per cents 
were 6.52 for the publie and 19.38 for the private high schools. In 
German the per cents were 11.40 and 16.07; in algebra, 54.27 and 
46.88; in geometry, 25.34 and 22.06; in trigonometry, 2.53 and 5.39; in 
astronomy, 4.79 and 6.69; in physies, 22.77 and 20.32; in chemistry, 
9.15 and 9.79; in physical geography, 23.89 and 18.15; in geology, 5 
and 7.08; in physiology, 29.95 and 22.34; in psychology, 2.74 and 5.13; 
in rhetoric, 32.05 and 29.12; in general history, 34.33 and 35.60. 
EQUIPMENT AND INCOME, 
The number of private high schools reporting libraries was 1,361, as 
may be seen from-an inspection of Table 20. The aggregate number 
of volumes in these libraries was 1,498,427. 
Of the total number of schools, 1,545 reported the value of property 
owned. The aggregate, including value of grounds, buildings, and 
scientific apparatus, was $51,865,512, This would give to each school 
reporting an average valuation of property of $33,570. 
Only 315 of the schools are endowed institutions, but the endow- 
ments aggregate $24,729,613, an average of about $78,500 to a sehool. 
Publie funds were received in small amounts by 301 schools, the 
aggregate reaching only $157,293. 
Only 1,424 schools reported the amounts received from tuition fees. 
The aggregate was $6,002,380. 
The number of schools having income from productive funds was 
338, and the amounts received from this source aggregated $1,864,054. 
This sum is more than 75 per cent of the aggregate of endowments 
reported. The rate is probably too high, owing to the fact that 23 
schools reporting incomes from productive funds were not reported as 
having endowments. 
Only 1,449 of the 2,180 private high schools answered the question in 
regard to total amount of income. The aggregate received for support 
from all sources was $8,878,218, or about $6,127 to each school. 
Benefactions amounting to $495,760 were received in 1895 by 140 
schools. The North Atlantic Division claimed 51 of these schools and
-P-A-G-E-86
  28 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
$219,077 of the gifts. It may also be noted that of the $24,729,613, 
total endowment of private secondary schools, $20,312,025 is possessed 
by 165 schools in the North Atlantic Division, and that 21 schools in 
Pennsylvania have $12,415,813, or more than half of the entire sum. 
The endowment of Girard College, $11,235,113, is included in this sum. 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Less than half the private secondary schools are controlled or sup- 
ported by religious denominations. Of the 2,180 schools reporting to 
this office, 1,270 are nonsectarian. (See Tables 21 and 22.) The Roman 
Catholic Church supports 280 schools, having 12,777 secondary students. 
The Episcopal Church has 119 schools with 5,552 students; the Baptist, 
109 schools with 7,424 students; the Presbyterian, 102 schools with 
4,654 students; the Methodist Episcopal Church South 72 schools and 
7,685 students; the Congregational, 56 schools and 2,882 students; the 
Friends, 57 schools with 3,851 students; the Methodist, 39 schools with 
2,144 students; the Lutheran, 36 schools with 1,908 students. All 
other religious denominations have 40 schools with 3,564 students. 
PUBLIO AND PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
To facilitate the study of the statistics of secondary schools, regard- 
less of whether the schools are public or private, Tables 24 to 29 were 
prepared from the preceding tables, relating separately to public and 
private high schools. 
Table 24 shows that in 1894-95 there were 6,892 secondary or high 
schools reporting to this office. These schools had 22,681 teachers 
instructing secondary students. In the schools there were 468,446 
secondary students, 201,431 males and 267,015 females. The males con- 
stituted 43 per cent and the females 57 per cent of the students in 
high-school studies. The proportion of male and female students varies 
greatly in different States, as may be seen by comparing the fifth and 
seventh columns of Table 24. In several States the per cent of female 
students is above 60. 
Ten per cent of the students, or 46,847, were preparing for the college 
classical courses and 7.11 per cent, or 33,350, for the college scientific 
courses. Compare the last column of Table 24 with the second column 
of Table 25. The third and fourth columns of the latter table show 
that 80,197 students, or 17.11 per cent of the whole number, were pre- 
paring for college. 
The number of graduates in 1895 was 54,353, or 11.60 per cent of the 
whole number of secondary students. The number of college prepara- 
tory students in the classes that graduated was 17,636, or 32.44 per cent 
of the whole number of graduates. 
The numbers of students pursuing certain secondary studies are 
given in Tables 26 to 29. The per cent in each study in each State is 
also given in the same tables.
-P-A-G-E-87
  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 29 
Of the 468,446 secondary students there were 205,006, or 43.76 per 
cent, studying Latin. The per cent was highest in the South Atlantic 
division, 55.69. In several States of that division more than 60 per 
cent of the high-school students pursued this study. 
The number of secondary students pursuing Greek was 22,159, or 
only 4.73 per cent of the whole number. The North Atlantic Division 
had 8.41 per cent. New Hampshire was first in the list, with 14.73 per 
cent of students in Greek. 
French was studied by 45,746 students, or 9.77 per cent of the whole 
number. In the North Atlantic Division the per cent was 18.77. In 
Massachusetts the per cent of students in French was 38,02, and the 
per cent in Louisiana was 46.60. However, the disproportion in num- 
bers was very great, Massachusetts having 12,619 students in French 
and Louisiana only 1,378. 
The German language had 58,921 students in the secondary schools, 
12.58 per cent of the whole number. The North Atlantic had 16.48 per 
cent, the highest for any division, and Maryland had 28.83 per cent, 
the highest for any State. 
Algebra is the study which claims the largest number of students, 
as will be seen by reference to the first column of Table 27. There 
were 245,465 students in this branch, or 52.40 per cent of the whole 
number. The percentages in the two Southern divisions were 58.72 
and 58.97, respectively, and in the North Atlantic Division 49.15. In 
Maryland more than 70 per cent studied algebra. 
The number studying geometry was less than half the number in 
algebra. There were 114,813 studentsin geometry, 24.51 per cent of the 
whole number. In the North Central Division the per cent was only 
22,54, while in the Western Division it was 29.48. 
The study claiming the smallest number of students was trigonom- 
etry. Only 15,243, or 3.25 per cent, pursued this branch of mathe- 
matics. Thetwo Southern divisions show percentages of 6.28 and 6.88. 
In Alabama the per cent was 13.67, in Vermont 0.69, and in Minne- 
sota 0.41. 
The per cent of students in astronomy was 5.27, the number being 
24,690. The largest per cent, 12.60, was claimed by Florida, and the 
smallest, 0.87, by Delaware. 
Physics was studied by 103,768 students, or over 22.15 per cent of the 
whole number. The State having the largest per cent of students in 
this branch was Maryland, with 42.65. In Vermont the per cent was 
14,81 and in Utah only 8.89. 
Chemistry had 43,607 students. This number was 9.31 per cent of 
all. The Western Division had 13.29 per cent of its students in chem- 
istry, Nevada leading with 32.14 per cent. 
The number of students in physical geography was 105,124, or 22.44 
per cent of the total. In the North Central Division 24.74 per cent of 
the students pursued this study. The per cent in South Dakota was
-P-A-G-E-88
30 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-95. 
36.18. In the South Atlantic Division the per cent was 23.31, Florida 
alone having 43.66 per cent of its secondary students in physical 
geography. 
There were 25,866 students in geology, 5.52 per cent of the whole 
number. The table shows wide variations between the percentages in 
different States. In Tennessee the per cent was 12.08 and in Maryland 
only 2.43. 
Physiology had a larger number of students than any other science 
study. The number was 131,304 and the per cent 28.03, as may be seen 
from Table 29. The per cent for the South Central Division was 31.97 
and for the Western Division 18.62. In Arkansas 43.89 per cent of the 
students studied physiology. 
The number of students in psychology was 15,677, the per cent being 
3.35. Several States reported no students in this study. In Utah the 
per cent was 10.66. Oklahoma’s 44 students in psychology comprised 
20.95 per cent of the whole number of secondary students in that 
Territory. 
Rhetoric was studied by 31.31 per cent of the secondary students, 
the number pursuing this study being 146,672. The per cent for the 
Western Division was 40.92 and for the North Atlantic 27.56. The per 
cent for California was 52.60 and for New York 21.23, 
General history, or history other than that of the United States, had 
162,336 students, or 34.65 per cent of the total. The Western Division 
had 46.58 per cent, the South Atlantic 43.48, the South Central 36.71, 
the North Atlantic 35.51, and the North Central 30.01. The largest per 
cent for any State was 61.59, for Maryland, and the smallest 17.05, for 
Utah. 
SECONDARY STUDENTS. 
It was stated in the beginning of this chapter that there were 539,712 
secondary students in eight classes of institutions reporting to this 
office in 1895. Tables 30 and 31 show the distribution of these students 
according to the class of institution in which they are found as well as 
their distribution by States and geographical divisions. 
The third column of Table 30 shows the grand total of secondary 
students in public and private institutions, the first column showing 
that there were 243,151 males, and the second column 296,561 females. 
The North Atlantic Division had 164,439 of these students, the South 
Atlantic 49,378, the South Central 66,797, the North Central 229,055, 
and the Western Division 30,043. 
The sixth column of this table summarizes the number of secondary 
students in public high schools. The distribution of these 350,099 stu- 
dents has been noted in preceding pages. 
The ninth column of Table 30 shows that there were 6,024 secondary 
students in the preparatory departments of public colleges and univer- 
sities, 4,327 males and 1,697 females. These were distributed among 
86 State institutions in 31 States and Territories.  
-P-A-G-E-89
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 31 
In the public normal schools of 18 States there were 5,247 students 
of secondary grade, 1,228 males and 4,019 females. The total is given 
in the twelfth column of Table 30. 
The total number of secondary students in public institutions was 
361,370, as shown in the last column of the table. Of this total 149,632 
were males and 211,738 females. 
Table 31 shows the distribution of secondary students in private 
institutions. In the third column will be found the number in private 
high schools and academies, 118,347. This summary was noticed at 
length in preceeding pages. 
The preparatory departments of private colleges and universities 
had 43,164 students, 29,538 males and 13,626 females. As will be seen 
from the sixth column of Table 31, more than one-half of these second- 
ary students were in the North Central Division. Of these Illinois had 
4,336, Ohio 4,282, and Missouri 3,191. 
In the preparatory departments of colleges for women there were 
4,824 secondary students. (See column 7, Table 31, Table 31.) 
The private normal schools had 8,589 secondary students, as shown 
in the tenth column, 4,568 males and 4,021 females. Of these 2,982 
were in the North Central Division. 
The manual training schools of 11 States had 3,418 students of see- 
ondary grade, 2,059 males and 1,359 females. (See column 13, Table 31.) 
The total number of secondary students in. private institutions was 
178,342, as shown in the last column of the table, 93,519 males and 
84,823 females. This total was divided among the divisions as follows: 
North Atlantic, 51,518; South Atlantic, 27,743; South Central, 37,213; 
North Central, 52,378; Western, 9,490. 
A SPATISTICAL REVIEW. 
Following the 31 tables giving statistical summaries of public and 
private secondary schools for the scholastic year 1894-95, this chapter 
concludes with a statistical review for the past five years. Thirty-four 
tables, 32 to 65, review the more important statistical items relating to 
high schools from 1890-91 to 1894-95. This review was made necessary 
since certain errors had crept into a few of the summaries in former 
years, and, moreover, for one or two years important summaries had. 
been omitted entirely. These summaries have been compiled from the 
original returns and are here presented in a form which will make them 
valuable for comparison. Thus, it will be seen that for five years the 
statistics of secondary schools are continuous. The forms of inquiry 
were similar, and the information appears tabulated for each year in 
summaries which are uniform. It is true that certain of the tables 
show wide variations between two years, but these apparent inconsist- 
encies are partially explained in footnotes. 
Tables 32 to 48 relate to public high schools. Table 32 shows the 
number of such schools for each of the five years from 1891 to 1895 for
-P-A-G-E-90
32 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
each State and the number of instructors for each year. Table 33 gives 
the number of male and female teachers instructing secondary students; 
34 gives the number of secondary students and elementary pupils for 
each year; 35, the secondary students, male and female; 36, the ele- 
mentary pupils, male and female; 37, the colored secondary students, 
male and female; 38, the classical and the scientific college preparatory 
students; 39, the classical preparatory students, male and female; 
40, the scientific preparatory students, male and female; 41, the grad- 
uates for each year, male and female; 42, the graduates and the college 
preparatory students in the graduating class each year; 43, the col- 
lege preparatory graduates, male and female; 44, the number of vol- 
umes in the public-school libraries each year; 45, the value of grounds, 
buildings, and scientific apparatus; 46, amount of aid received from 
the States, counties, and cities; 47, amounts received from tuition; 
48, total income for each year. 
Tables 49 to 65 relate to private high schools and academies, and 
deal with like items and in the same order as above enumerated for 
public high schools. The tables are readily understood without further 
explanation. 
THE ENDOWED ACADEMIES. 
The names of the 315 academies and private high schools reporting 
endowments will be found in the list which follows. The amount of 
the endowment for each school, as reported to this office in 1895, is 
given in the following table:

CHAPTER III. 
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
A large proportion of the normal schools in the United States, the 
public as well as the private institutions, maintain various courses of 
study in addition to the courses designed for the professional training 
of teachers. Great care has been exercised in collecting the statistics 
of normal schools to obtain correct returns of the number of students 
actually pursuing teachers’ training courses. The number of students 
pursuing courses especially organized for teachers in universities and 
colleges, in academies and high schools, has also been ascertained by 
special inquiry: A summary of the statistics thus obtained shows that 
in the scholastic year 1894-95 there were in the United States 80,839 
students pursuing training courses for teachers. These students were 
distributed as follows: In public normal schools, 36,491; in private 
normal schools, 22,013; in universities and colleges, 6,402; in public 
high schools, 6,809; in private high schools, 9,124, 
The number of graduates from the public normal schools was 5,492 
and the number from the private normal schools 3,094, The number 
graduating from teachers’ training courses in other institutions is not 
known. The public and private normal schools, with 58,504 normal 
students, sent out 8,586 graduates who had pursued teachers’ training 
courses. The per cent of graduates to the total number of normal stu- 
dents was 14.68. If it be assumed that the percentage of graduates 
to the number of normal students in other institutions, 22,335, was 
14.68, then these colleges, high schools, and academies must have grad- 
uated 3,279 normal students. It will thus be seen that the number of 
trained teachers graduated from the various institutions enumerated 
must have been about 11,865 for the class of 1895. 
Some idea of the growth of normal schools in the past ten years 
may be gained by an inspection of the following table, which shows 
the number of schools, instructors, students, and graduates in 1884-85 
and in 1894-95:

  108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The Education Report for 1884-85 does not show the number of stu- 
dents in teachers’ training courses in universities and colleges, public 
and private high schools. It can be stated as a fact, however, that 
there has been a large increase in the number of students pursuing 
such courses in these institutions within the last ten years. 
PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The statistics of public normal schools will be found summarized :n 
Tables 1 to 6 in this chapter. Table 1 gives the number of schools in 
each State and the number of teachers employed in the public normal 
schools of each State. In the 155 schools there were 1,584 teachers 
instructing normal students, 649 males and 935 females. There were 
467 teachers wholly for other departments, 119 males and 348 females. 
The total number of teachers in the 155 schools was 2,051. 
The numbers of students in several courses of study are shown in 
Table 2. There were 36,491 normal students, 10,353 males and 26,138 
females. There were 289 students in business courses, 5,247 in secondary 
grades and 15,677 in elementary grades. These numbers make a total 
of 57,704, as shown in the third column of Table 3. There were 1,298 
colored normal students included in the third column of Table 2. The 
last column of Table 3 shows that there were 19,461 pupils in the model 
schools connected with public normal schools. This number is not 
included in the grand total summarized in the third column of Table 3. 
In many instances certain grades in city systems are used as model 
schools by public normals, but generally the model schools are organized. 
in the secondary and elementary grades which belong to the normal 
schools. 
Table 4 shows the number of graduates from the public normal schools 
in the class of 1895. As already stated, there were 5,492 normal grad- 
uates, 1,013 males and 4,479 females. There were 291 graduates in 
business courses and 374 in other courses. Of the normal graduates, 
more than 81 per cent were women. In the North Atlantic Division the 
female graduates were more than 86 per cent of the total number of 
normal graduates; in the North Central Division the per cent was 74; 
in the South Atlantic nearly 85; in the South Central 67, and in the 
Western Division nearly 90. 
The aggregate amount received by the 155 public normal schools from 
State, county, and city appropriations for support for the year 1894-95 
was $1,917,375, as shown in Table 5. The amount received from tuition 
and other fees was $370,849. Nine States received $58,808 from pro- 
ductive funds. The amounts received from other sources and unclassi- 
fied aggregated $362,431. A portion of this sum should be distributed 
in the three preceding columns of Table 5, but it can not be properly 
apportioned here on account of the manner in which certain schools 
reported their income. The total income of the 155 schools for the year 
1894-95 was $2,709,463,
-P-A-G-E-167
  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 109 
Table 6 shows that 119 public normal schools had libraries, and that 
these libraries contained 300,776 volumes. The estimated value of these 
libraries was $369,333. 
It appears also that the value of buildings, grounds, and scientific 
apparatus was $14,454,275, and that the value of other property was 
$410,347. 
The aggregate amount appropriated by States, counties, and cities 
for buildings and improvements for public normal schools in 1894-95 
was $1,003,933. 
PRIVATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The 201 private normal schools reporting to this office in 1895 had~ 
1,059 teachers instructing normal students, 616 males and 443 females 
(See Table 7.) There were 900 other teachers, 397 males and 503 females 
instructing pupils in other departments. The total number of instruct 
ors in the 201 schools was 1,959. 
Table 8 shows the distribution of students according to four classes 
or courses. In these private normal schools there were 22,013 normal 
students proper, 11,442 males and 10,571 females. It will be noted that 
nearly 65 per cent of these private normal students are in the North 
Central Division—that is, 14,374 of the 22,013 students. Indiana alone 
had 4,494 of these students, and Ohio 2,129. Five States of the North 
Atlantic Division had no private normal schools. 
In the 201 private normal schools there were 5,210 students in busi- 
ness courses, 3,547 males and 1,663 females. Other students in grades 
equivalent to secondary or high-school grades numbered 8,589. In 
these secondary grades there were 4,568 males and 4,021 females. In 
the elementary grades there were 18,264 pupils, 8,990 boys and 9,274 
girls. The total enrollment in the four departments was 54,076 stu- 
dents, 28,578 males and 25,498 females, as shown in the first three 
columns of Table 9. This table also shows that there were 1,931 
colored students included in the enumeration of normal students in 
Table 8. In the model schools utilized by the normal schools 3,728 
children were reported. 
Table 10 shows that there were 3,094 graduates from the normal 
departments, 1,612 males and 1,482 females. There were 2,015 gradu- 
ates in business courses and 1,253 in other courses. 
Table 11 exhibits the income of private normal schools from various 
sources. In sixteen States these schools received aid from State, 
county, or city appropriations aggregating $57,399. The aggregate 
received from tuition and other fees, so far as reported, was $626,768. 
The amount received from productive funds by schools in sixteen States 
was $40,404. The amount received from other sources and unclassified 
was $386,095. The incomes of the 201 schools for the year 1894-95, so 
far as reported, aggregated $1,110,666. 
The value of buildings and other property owned by private normal 
schools is shown in Table 12. Of the 201 schools 147 were reported as
-P-A-G-E-168
    110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
having libraries. These libraries contained 180,873 volumes of an esti- 
mated value of $148,144. The aggregate value of buildings, grounds, 
scientific apparatus, etc., was $5,905,421. The value of endowments 
and other property reported by schools in twenty States was $839,243, 
and the value of benefactions received during the year 1894-95 was 
$254,001. 
The per cent of male and female students and the per cent of gradu- 
ates to the number of normal students, for public and for private normal 
schools in each State may be learned from an inspection of Table 13. 
In the public normal schools the per cent of male students was only 
28.37, while in the private normal schools the per cent of males was 
51,98. 
DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL STUDENTS. 
The number of students pursuing teachers’ training courses in other 
institutions than normal schools is shown in Table 14. In 192 colleges 
and universities there were 6,402 normal students. In 433 public high 
schools there were 6,809 normal students, 2,007 males and 4,802 females. 
In 458 private high schools there were 9,124 such students, 3,900 males 
and 5,224 females. The total number of normal students in the three 
classes of institutions was 22,335. 
Table 15 recapitulates the totals of preceding tables, exhibiting the 
number of normal students in each of the five classes of institutions. 
The last column shows the total number of normal students in the 
United States as reported to this office to be 80,839. 
REVIEW OF PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOL STATISTICS. 
The statistics of public normal schools for the past five years are 
reviewed in Tables 16 to 21. Table 16 shows the number of schools, 
and the number of teachers employed in the normal departments in 
each State reported to this office each year from 1891 to 1895. The 
number of schools increased from 131 in 1891, to 155 in 1895. Table 17 
shows the number of normal students and the number of normal grad- 
uates each year for five years. Table 18 shows the number of each sex 
in the normal departments each year. Table 19 exhibits the number 
of teachers and students in the other departments. Table 20 shows 
the amounts appropriated by States, counties, and cities for the 
support of these public normal schools each year. The aggregate in 
1890-91 was $1,285,700, and in 1894-95 it was $1,917,375. The public 
appropriations for buildings and improvements for each of the five 
years are shown in Table 21. 
NORMAL STUDENTS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
More than 200 of the colleges and universities of the United States 
now offer courses of study designed to meet the demand for the pro- 
fessional training of teachers. In 27 of these institutions there are
-P-A-G-E-169

organized departments of pedagogy maintaining courses of study for 
teachers leading to degrees. 
In 1890 there were 3,414 students in 114 universities and colleges 
pursuing courses of study designed for the training of teachers. In 
1891 the number of such students was 3,978. For the scholastic year 
1892-93 there were 5,232 students training as teachers in 155 such 
institutions. In 1893-94 the number had increased to 5,500 students 
in 173 universities and colleges. For the year 1894-95 the list of insti- 
tutions had increased to 192 and the number of normal students to 
6,402. In the following table is given a list of universities and col- 
leges which have in the past three years reported students in teachers’ 
training courses. The number of students reported for each year is 
given. Institutions marked with an asterisk (*) have departments of 
pedagogy, but did not in every instance report pedagogical students 
separately.

    DEPARTMENTS OF PEDAGOGY. 
The twenty-seven institutions in the preceding list marked with an 
asterisk (*) offer professional training to teachers in regularly organized 
departments of pedagogy. The courses of study usually extend over 
the four years and lead to degrees equivalent to other college first 
degrees. In a few instances post-graduate courses are offered. At the 
head of the department is generally a professor of pedagogy. The 
subject is usually treated in five or more courses or subdivisions, such 
as practical pedagogy, school organization and supervision, history of 
education, theory of education, and educational systems. Seminary 
work is provided for in nearly all the institutions named. In the fol- 
lowing table is given a synopsis of the courses offered in the depart- 
ments of pedagogy in each of the twenty-seven institutions mentioned. 
The courses are not in all cases arranged as here indicated, but the 
synopsis includes all the subjects offered in the departments of peda- 
gogy in these colleges and universities.

  CHAPTER IV. 
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION, 1894-95. 
I.—UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 
Institutions—The number of universities and colleges for men and 
for both sexes from which reports were received at the close of the 
scholastic year 1894-95 is 481. This number is greater by five than 
the number of institutions reported the preceding year, the increase 
being due to the opening of new institutions and to the fact that the 
Pennsylvania State College, at State College, Pa., which has heretofore 
been treated as a technological institution, is now included in the table 
of universities and colleges. The following institutions were suspended 
during the year 1894-95: Southern Illinois College, Enfield, Ml.; Wichita 
University, Wichita, Kans.; Western College, Labelle, Mo.; Hopedale 
Normal College, Hopedale, Ohio, and New Market Polytechnic Institute. 
Newmarket, Va. 
Keuka College, New York; Hillsboro College, Hillsboro, Ohio; Twin 
Valley College, Germantown, Ohio, and Urbana University, Urbana, 
Ohio, will hereafter be included among secondary institutions, they 
having for the time being relinquished college work. 
Of the 481 institutions, 77 are located in the North Atlantic Divi- 
sion, 68 in the South Atlantic Division, 87 in the South Central 
Division, 204 in the North Central Division, and 45 in the Western 
Division. Only 109 of the institutions are reported as nonsectarian — 
that is, as not being under the control of any particular religious 
denomination. The remaining 372 institutions are divided among 28 
different denominations, the number of institutions under the control 
of each denomination being given in Table 1, pp. 153-154. 
The number of institutions that admit women to the undergraduate 
departments is 343, leaving 138 institutions in which a college course 
is still denied to women. Several of the latter class of institutions 
have, however, opened the graduate departments to all classes of stu- 
dents. Of the 138 institutions that do not admit women, 58 are under 
the control of the Roman Catholic Church, which has not, so far as 
known, opened any of its higher institutions to both sexes. The aver- 
age number of college students to each institution for men only is 163, 
while the average number for coeducational institutions is 119. In 
149

this connection it may be well to state that some of the larger Eastern 
universities, like Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton, have not 
yet opened their undergraduate departments to women. Among the. 
institutions that have lately become coeducational are Furman Uni- 
versity, Greenville, S. C., which was opened to women in the fall 
of 1893; Beloit College, Beloit, Wis., whose collegiate department was 
opened to women on September 17, 1895, and Hiwassee College, Ten- 
nessee, which was opened to women in 1894. 
The number of institutions that have been opened for instruction 
in the several decades from 1638 to 1895 is given in Table 3, p. 156, 
From this table we find that 49 institutions have been opened since 
the year 1890. 
Professors and instructors.—The total number of professors and in- 
structors reported by the 481 institutions is 11,582, of which number 
10,040 are men and 1,542 women. The proportion of male and female 
teachers in the several departments by geographical divisions is as 
follows:

The average number of instructors per institution by geographical 
divisions is as follows: North Atlantic Division, 41.8; South Atlantic 
Division, 17.1; South Central Division, 15.2; North Central Division, 
23.5; Western Division, 24.1; and for the entire country, 24.1. 
Students —The total number of students in all departments of the 
481 institutions was 149,939, divided as follows: Preparatory depart- 
ments, 30.8 per cent; collegiate departments, 42.3 per cent; graduate 
departments, 2.9 per cent; professional departments, 15.7 per cent, and 
other departments, 8.3 per cent. The classification of students by sex 
and color in the several departments by geographical divisions was 
reported as follows:

Of the 63,402 students reported as being in the collegiate depart- 
ments, only 48,324, or 76.2 per cent, were reported in courses leading to 
a first or bachelor’s degree. A number of the universities and colleges 
of the country maintain pedagogical and business departments. There 
were enrolled in 1894-95 in such institutions 5,316 pedagogical stu- 
dents and 5,175 commercial students. 
Degrecs.—The number of degrees conferred during the scholastic 
year was 9,972, excluding honorary degrees. Of the total number, 
8,259 were conferred on men and 1,713 on women. The number of 
A. B. degrees conferred was 4,812, or nearly one-half of the entire 
number. The number of Ph. D. degrees conferred was 232, of which 
number 19 were received by women. The number and kind of degrees 
conferred on men and on women by the institutions of the several 
States and Territories is given in Tables 7 and 8, pp. 164-166, 
The number of honorary degrees conferred was 895, of which num- 
ber 626 were doctorates. The number of persons who received the 
D. D. degree was 345, while 207 received the LL. D. degree.

Property.—The value of the entire equipment of the institutions is 
given as $232,195,461, of which amount $102,574,808 are reported as 
permanent endowment funds. The proportion of property held by the 
institutions of the several divisions is as follows:

com ie ae ee statement we find that while the Nout 
Atlantic Division contains but 16 per cent of the entire number of 
institutions, these institutions have 42.9 per cent of the number of 
fellowships, 48.7 per cent of the scholarships, 45.4 per cent of the 
volumes in libraries, 48.2 per cent of the value of apparatus, 38.7 per 
cent of the value of buildings and grounds, and 55.1 per cent of all the 
productive funds. For the amount or value of property held by any 
individual institution, reference should be made to the detailed statis- 
tical tables in volume 2, 
Benefactions.—The entire amount of benefactions reported by the 
several institutions as having been received during the year is 
$5,350,963. This amount is less by nearly four million dollars than the 
amount received by this class of institutions during the preceding year. 
The institutions receiving the largest amounts of money were the 
University of Chicago, $800,000; Columbia College, $428,484; and the 
University of Pennsylvania, $411,479. i 
Income.—The total income reported by the universities and colleges 
was $16,783,638, of which amount 37.8 per cent was derived from siu- 
dents’ fees, 31.7 per cent from endowments, 17.6 per cent from munic- 
ipal, State, and national appropriations, and 12.9 per cent from 
miscellaneous sources. The institutions in the North Central Division 
received 58.1 per cent of all State appropriations. The proportion of 
income derived from the various sources by the institutions of the 
several divisions is as follows:

IJI.—ScHoois or TECHNOLOGY. 
Institutions.—Under the head of schools of technology are included 
only independent schools, the statistics of technological departments 
of universities and colleges being included in the statistics of the insti- 
tutions with which they are connected. Of the 51 institutions included 
31 are colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts endowed by the 
acts of Congress of July 2, 1862, and August 30, 1890. 
Professors and instructors—The total number of professors and 
instructors reported by these institutions was 1,217, of which number 
1,130, or 92.9 per cent, taught in the regular collegiate departments. 
The number of female instructors is very small, being but 92, or 7.6 per 
cent of the total number. The proportion of instructors in the several 
departments as compared with the proportion of institutions is as 
follows:

Western Division. 15.7 12.1 9.0 9.9 
  The average number of instructors per institution in the several geo- 
graphical divisions is as follows: North Atlantic Division, 33; South 
Atlantic Division, 17; South Central Division, 23; North Central Divi- 
sion, 27; Western Division, 15; while for the entire number of institu- 
tions the average is 24, 
Students.—The total number of students enrolled in the schools of 
technology was 13,896, of which number 1,865 were women. The pro- 
portion of students, by sex, in the various departments of the institu- 
tions of the several geographical divisions was as follows:

Degrecs.—The total number of degrees conferred by the schools of 
technology was 1,093, of which number 105 were conferred on women. 
Four of the institutions conferred 19 A. B. degrees. The large number 
of B. 8. degrees, 508, is undoubtedly due to the fact that this degree is 
given in a number of institutions on the completion of the various 
technical courses, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
Colorado Agricultural College, etc. The degree of bachelor of house- 
hold economy is conferred by but one institution, the Oregon State 
Agricultural College. 
Four of the institutions conferred honorary degrees. The name and 
number of each degree conferred was as follows: 1B. E.; 10. 1.; 1 Se. 
D.; 2 Ph. M.; 1 M.8.; 1 A.M; 1D. D.,, and 2 LL. D. 
Property.--Lhe value of all property held by schools of technology is 
$29,132,205, of which amount $13,609,529 are reported as productive 
endowment funds. The proportion of property held by the institutions 
in the several divisions, compared with the proportion of institutions, 
is as follows:

Benefactions.—The total amount of benefactions reported was 
$21,530. The small amount of money given to this class of institu- 
tions is undoubtedly due to the fact that very many of them are State 
institutions and do not appeal to any particular class of individuals, 
as is the case with institutions under sectarian control. The gifts of 
the people as a whole have been quite considerable, as will be seen by 
an examination of the column in Table 5, devoted to State or munici- 
pal appropriations, given to these institutions by the people through 
their representatives in the several State and Territorial legislatures. 
Income.—The total income of the 51 institutions was $3,965,593, of 
which amount $1,671,828 were appropriated by the General Government 
and $880,198 were granted by the several States and Territories. The 
receipts from tuition fees in this class of institutions are comparatively 
small, the amount received from this source being but $524,158, The 
average income of the institutions is $77,757. The proportion of income 
derived from the various sources by the institutions of the several 
divisions is as follows:

I._UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 
In the following pages will be found 19 tables giving the statistics 
concerning the principal items collected by this Bureau from the uni- 
versities and colleges during the five years from 1890-91 to 1894-95, 
both inclusive. In the year 1890-91 statistics concerning the financial 
condition of these institutions were not collected, so that in the tables 
devoted to finances the statistics for 1889-90 are used. In the prepara- 
tion of these tables it was found that there existed some incongruities 
in the statistics as reported from year to year, especially in the items 
concerning the value of the material equipment and in the amount of 
productive funds. These differences were due to the fact that some of
-P-A-G-E-243
  
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 185 
the reports were made in successive years by different persons who 
placed different estimates on the value of buildings, ete. In other 
cases the differences were due to depreciation in the value of real 
estate and in stocks held by the various institutions. An attempt was 
made to correct all incongruities due to varying estimates by examin- 
ing and comparing the reports of the several institutions for a series 
of years, and this has resulted in obtaining statistics which more truly 
represent the actual condition of these institutions. It should be borne 
in mind that it has been necessary to change the figures of individual 
institutions and that the summaries as given in the following pages will 
differ in some respects from the summaries as included in the several 
reports from 1890-91 to 1893-94. 
The number of institutions was increased from 430 in 1890-91 to 
481 in 1894-95. The rate of increase in some of the principal items 
concerning higher education is given in the following summarized

This statement shows that the largest per cent of increase in all the 
items included except productive funds has been in the Western Divi- 
sion, where the number of institutions was increased from 32 in 1890-91 
to 45 in 1894-95. The establishment of the Leland Stanford Junior 
University was one of the principal causes of the large per cent of 
increase in this division, but had no effect upon the productive funds, 
as its endowment is still retained under the sole management and con- 
trol of Mrs. Stanford. The greatest per cent in increase of productive 
funds is found in the North Central Division. This division is the home 
of the University of Chicago, which was opened for instruction in 
1892-93 and has been liberally provided with endowment funds. 
The average number of students per institution during the several 
years under consideration was as follows:

In obtaining the above averages, all classes of students—preparatory, 
collegiate, graduate, professional, normal, music, etc.—were included. 
In the following tabular statement the average number of undergrad- 
uate college students per institution is given:

From this table it will be seen that the North Atlantic Division has 
more than twice the average number of students per institution than 
shown by either of the other geographical divisions; also that the num- 
ber of students per institution has gradually increased in the North 
Atlantic, North Central, and Western divisions, while in the South 
Atlantic and South Central divisions the average number has varied 
very slightly. 
The average number of instructors per institution in the several 
divisions was as follows:

the North Atlantic, North Central, and Western divisions there has

been a marked advance in this respect, while in the South Atlantic 
Division the average number has been increased by 1, and in the 
South Central Division there has been no change, the average number 
remaining the same. 
During the past five years there has been very little variation in the 
number of college students to each instructor, as will be seen by the

The Western Division comprises within its borders many of the 
newer States, in which new institutions have been established within 
the past ten years. These institutions, owing to the fact that there are 
few preparatory schools in some of the newer States which fit students 
for college work, have but few students in college classes, the large 
majority of them being in preparatory classes. This fact tends to 
lower the average number of students per instructor in this division. 
As stated before, statistics concerning financial matters were not col- 
lected in the year 1890-91. The average annual income of universities 
and colleges for the four years from 1891-92 to 1894-95 was as follows:

  Here it is noticed that while the increase in the average income of 
institutions for the entire country was but $2,918, the increase in the 
North Atlantic Division was nearly $15,000. The only other division 
that shows an increase is the North Central Division, where the increase 
is $4,860 per institution.

II.—COLLEGES FOR WOMEN. 
The statistics concerning colleges for women from the year 1890-91 
to 1894-95, as reported to this office, are given on the following pages. 
An examination of these statistics will show that the figures vary con- 
siderably from year to year.

Tt will 
be noticed that in 1890-91 the number of institutions included was 167,
-P-A-G-E-265
  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 207 
while in 1891-92 the number was but 158, and in 1892-93 it was still 
further reduced to 142. This decrease in numbers may be traced to 
several causes, among which may be mentioned the following: (1) Each 
year a number of these institutions are either temporarily suspended. 
or permanently closed. (2) Some institutions abandon collegiate work 
and devote themselves exclusively to secondary work. (3) In several 
cases institutions have become parts of the public-school systems of 
the cities or towns in which they are located. 
It will be observed that the number of institutions was inereased 
from 142 in 1892-93 to 166 in 1893-94, and again reduced to 163 in 
1894-95. 
In 1894 a circular letter was sent to all county superintendents of 
schools, asking them to furnish a list of all educational institutions in 
their respective counties. In this way a number of new institutions 
were added to the list of colleges for women, which accounts for the 
increase of institutions for the year 1893-94. During the scholastic 
year 1894-95 the office was informed of the suspension of 7 colleges 
for women. This decrease was counteracted in a measure by the 
establishment of new institutions, so that the net decrease for the year 
is but 3. 
The average number of professors and instructors to each institution 
for the several years, as well as the number of students per institution, 
are given in the following tabular statements:

208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
From these tabular statements it is observed that the North Atlantic 
Division has the largest average number of students per institution as 
well as the largest average number of professors and instructors. 
These averages have been increasing gradually during the past five 
years. In all the other divisions the average number of students has 
varied from year to year. 
Some of the institutions of this class ido not possess libraries of their 
own, the deficiency in this respect being covered in a measure by the 
private libraries owned by the presidents or principals of the several 
institutions. The average number of volumes in the libraries of the 
institutions in the several geographical divisions was as follows:

IlIl.—SCHOOLS OF TECHNOLOGY. 
The number of independent schools of technology increased from 40 
in 1890-91 to 51 in 1894-95. This increase is due to the establishment 
in the newer States and in the Territories of colleges of agriculture and 
the mechanic arts, endowed by the acts of Congress of July 2, 1862, 
and August 30, 1890, and to the separation of similar colleges from 
other educational institutions in several of the older States. The sta- 
tistics of these institutions for the years 1890-91 and 1891-92 are very 
incomplete and no attempt has been made to form totals for several of 
the geographical divisions and for the United States for those years. 
The statistics for the three years from 1892-93 to 1894-95 are, however, 
quite complete, as will be seen by an examination of the following 
tables. 
The number of institutions of this class maintaining preparatory 
departments is quite small, the number of instructors in such depart- 
ments during the past year being only 141. The number of instructors 
in collegiate departments increased from 909 in 1892-93 to 1,130 in 
1894-95, and the entire number of instructors in all departments 
increased from 1,016 in 1892-93 to 1,217 in 1894-95. The average num- 
ber of instructors per institution during the several years was as 
follows:

From these statements it is seen that the number of instructors per 
institution has been steadily increasing from 1890-91 to the present 
time. 
The total number of students increased from 11,957 in 1892-93 to 
13,896 in 1894-95. The increase in the number of preparatory students 
is due to the fact that the recently established institutions in the newer 
States and in the Territories enroll the majority of their students in 
preparatory departments. As the public schools become able to pre-

pare students for college classes the number of preparatory students 
will decrease. The number of students of the various classes per insti- 
tution are given in the following statements:

  As will be seen from the preceding tables, the institutions of the 
North Atlantic Division have the largest average number of college 
students to each institution, while the South Central Division has the 
largest number of students of all classes per institution. The largest 
number of graduate students are found in the North Central Division. 
The number of volumes in libraries increased from 358,481 in 1891-92 
to 446,681 in 1894-95. The average number of volumes per institution 
during the several years was as follows:

While there as been an actual increase each year in the number of 
volumes in libraries for each of the several divisions, it will be noticed 
that there has been a slight variation in the average number per insti- 
tution in two of the divisions, viz, the South Atlantic and Western 
divisions. The decrease shown in these divisions is due to the estab- 
lishment of new institutions whose libraries have not yet attained any 
considerable size. As many of these institutions are receiving an 
annually increasing appropriation from the United States Government, 
it is but natural to expect that the number of volumes in libraries, as 
well as the value of scientific apparatus, will be annually increased. 
The value of apparatus and the value of grounds and buildings per 
institution during the several years were as follows: 
Vaiue of scientific apparatus per institution.

  The total value of grounds and buildings increased from $10,687,870 
in 1892-93 to $12,230,734 in 1894-95. In the South Atlantic Division 
the value of grounds and buildings decreased from $1,774,390 in 
1893-94 to $1,623,015 in 1894-95. This decrease is easily accounted 
for, as the buildings of the Clemson Agricultural College, South Caro- 
lina, were destroyed by fire. 
The income of these institutions in 1894-95 amounted to $3,798,791, 
which is $524,060 less than the income for 1893-94. In this connection 
it should, however, be remembered that the Pennsylvania State Col- 
lege, with an income of over $120,000, is not included in these statistics 
for the year 1894-95. The State appropriations to these institutions 
were less by $255,000 than they were in the preceding year. This 
decrease occurred in all of the divisions except the South Atlantic

of either law or medicine. This is to be explained in part by the fact 
that medical and law schools so frequently constitute departments of 
universities, in the use of whose buildings, grounds, and funds they are 
allowed to participate; while according to the American idea of entire 
separation of church and state, theological schools can not form part of 
those universities at least which are supported by State governments. 
Although about one-third of the theological schools made no report as 
to the value of grounds and buildings and the amount of endowment 
funds, the remaining schools reported grounds and buildings to the 
value of $12,057,747 and endowment funds to the amount of $16,083,683, 
while benefactions for the one year aggregated over $1,000,000. The 
endowment funds reported from medical schools aggregated only 
$749,992, and although these figures are below the real amount, it 
nevertheless remains true that medical schools are practically without 
endowments. From law schools the amounts reported were so small 
that they were not tabulated. Although medical schools have such 
meager endowments they own much valuable property, frequently near 
the center of large cities. From the schools reported the value of 
property is $8,130,422. Tables 5 to 20 show the increase in the number 
of schools and attendance for five years.

Topical outline: General educational policy and statistical summary—Elementary schools; 
relation of government to; comparative statistics—Renewal of the agitation respecting 
religious instruction in board schools and of public support for denominational schools. 
A sense of public responsibility with respect to the education of the 
masses and a deep-seated regard for local independence and local initia- 
tive mark the educational policy within the British Empire. It is the 
excess of one or the other of these principles which gives special char- 
acter to this policy as it operates in Great Britain, in Ireland, in the 
colonies, and in British India and other dependencies.

    258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The feeble beginning in 1833 (i. e., the appropriation of $100,000 for 
school buildings) scarcely foreshadowed the part which the General 
Government was to take in the development of this interest in Great 
Britain. Without encroaching ag all upon local rights or assuming 
local obligations, it has become the organizing power in elementary 
education and the chief source of its support, contributing in 1893-04 
about 67 per cent of the income of elementary schools in England 
and 73 per cent in Scotland. Nearly one-third of this appropriation, 
amounting to $10,213,800 for England and to $1,629,600 for Scotland, 
was the grant in lieu of fees. Local taxes (rates) supplied 19 per cent 
of the income in England and 22 per cent in Scotland, leaving about 
15 per cent derived from private sources in the former division and 
less than 5 per cent in the latter. : 
In England, as yet, only elementary instruction has been brought 
into the form of a system, which is determined in its main features by 
the law of 1870. The law, passed two years later (1872), for Seotland 
has a more extensive range. In this, secondary schools are distinctly 
recognized; moreover, Scotch universities have a very close relation 
to the Government, since parliamentary grants provide the larger part 
of their income. Hence, scholastic institutions of all grades in Scot- 
land have a basis for organic union, which is wanting in England. 
Nevertheless, taken in its full sense, the word system must be consid- 
ered as relating only to the elementary schools of Scotland, which are 
organized on substantially the same lines as those of England. 
The following summary presents the principal statisties pertaining 
to universities and elementary schools for the year under review:

  The entire province of secondary instruction is omitted from the above table, as 
no summaries for this department are attainable. Recent estimates place the num- 
ber of pupils pursuing secondary studies in England and Wales at 890,000, including 
the 90,000 pupils in higher board schools. In Scotland 73 secondary schools (i. e., 30 
public high schools, 24 endowed schools, and 19 private schools) have submitted to 
the scheme of government inspection. The number presenting candidates for the 
government ‘leaving certificate” in 1894 was 270, and the number of candidates 
13,173. The intermediate education board of Ireland, a public examining body, 
reports 6,974 students (5,265 boys and 1,709 girls) as coming up for examination in 
1894. 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
Supervision and control.In both divisions of Great Britain, the. 
action of the General Government with respect to elementary educa- 
tion is directed to securing through local agents sufficient school accom- 
modation, and an adequate outcome for the money appropriated from 
the public treasury. This action is exercised through committees of 
the privy council (education department for England and the same for 
Scotland). The vice-president of each committee! is the virtual head 
of the respective system, and represents its interests in the House of 
Commons when the appropriations or general regulations (codes) are 
under discussion. The local managers with whom the department 
deals are: (1) Elected boards serving for three years; (2) private 
bodies (churches, corporations, etc.), whose schools are subject to Gov- 
ernment inspection. Prior to 1895 every school was examined once a 
year by a Government inspector, who tested each class in the work of 
a prescribed programme, examined the buildings and premises with 
reference to specified requirements, and passed judgment upon the gen- 
eral organization and conduct of the school. By the regulations of 
1895, schools that have reached a certain standard are now excused 
1 Right Hon. A. H. Dyke Acland, vice-president for England at the date of the last 
report issued, was succeeded, in July, 1895, by Sir John Gorst. The vice-president 
for Scotland is Lord Balfour, of Burleigh.
-P-A-G-E-318
260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
from the ordeal of a rigid examination; in place of this may be substi- 
tuted two annual visits from the inspector, the visits to be made with- 
out notice. On these occasions the inspector is to test the instruction 
and the general condition of the school, and from the notes taken at 
the time to make up his report. The rate of grant allowed is deter- 
mined by this report.!. Thus virtually ends the system of “payment 
upon results.” 
For the maintenance of the inspection, England is divided into ten 
districts, each under a chief inspector. Under these is a force of 107 
inspectors, 45 subinspectors, and 152 inspectors’ assistants. There 
are also 2 chief inspectors for training colleges, a special inspector of 
music, a directress of needlework, and an inspectress of cookery and 
Jaundry work. 
Scotland is divided into three districts, each having a chief inspector. 
Under these are 25 inspectors, 4 subinspectors, and 21 assistants. 
Hilementary day schools; accommodation,. enrollment, and average 
attendance.—By the combined action of public and private agencies, 
school accommodation has been provided in England for 5,873,098 chil- 
dren, 77 per cent of the total number 3 to 14 years of age both inclu- 
sive, and in Scotland for 785,207, 82 per cent of the children 5 to 14 
both inclusive. 
For the year under review (1893-94) the total enrollment was for 
England, 5,235,887, and for Scotland, 699,716. 
The detailed statistics and comparative views presented in the 
annual reports include only the schools actually inspected during the 
current year, a number always a little below the total on the list. 
The following table gives the principal statistics in comparison with 
the same, for earlier dates. The date selected for England, 1876, was 
1Tho grant is composed as follows: 
(1) A fixed grant of 124s. to 14s. (10s. to 14s. Scotland) per pupil in average attend- 
ance. 
(2) A grant of 1s. to 14s. for discipline and organization, reckoned on average 
attendance. 
(3) Various grants in class and specified subjects. In Scotland a grant of 1s. to 
34s. is also allowed, according to the report on the general character of the instruc- 
tion in the three elementary subjects. Special grants (£10 to £15) are also allowed. 
under specified conditions for schools in thinly populated districts. Grants of £1 to 
£5 are also allowed in respect to cach pupil teacher required to make up the mini- 
mum staff who passes a specified examination and of £10 to £15 for each assistant 
teacher passing the examination for a Government certificate. The total annual 
grant toaschool, exclusive of the special grants to schools in sparsely settled regions, 
must not exceed 17s. 6d. for each unit of average attendance or the total income from 
all other sources. In other words, the Government ‘seeks to stimulate, but not to 
replace, local effort. 
In England infant schools are treated separately, grants for them reckoned on the 
basis of average attendance being: 
(1) Fixed grant, 7s. to 9s. per capita of average attendance. 
(2) Variable grant, 2s., 4s., or 6s. 
(3) Grant for singing, 6d. or 1s. 
(4) Grant for needlework, 1s. per capita of average attendance of girls.

  It will be seen from the above table that the progress of elementary 
instruction has far outstripped the growth in population, and that it is 
marked not only in respect to the enrollment of pupils, but in respect 
to conditions which may be taken as proofs of improvement in the 
system; such are the increase in average attendance, which exceeds 
that of enrollment, and the increase in the number of adult teachers, 
with a corresponding decline in the number of pupil teachers. As the 
deficiency of school provision existing when the Government began its 
active efforts is overcome, the progress of the system is necessarily less 
decided than at first, nevertheless the growth from year to year more 
than keeps pace with the increase of population. 
Comparing the statistics of 1894 with those of 1893, it appears that in 
England the increase of the population during the year is estimated at 
1.109 per cent; the enrollment shows an increase of 1.41 per cent; the 
average attendanee, an increase of 3.07 per cent. The enrollment was 
equivalent to 17.29 per cent of the population. 
In Scotland, while the estimated population shows an increase over 
1893 of 0.8 per cent, the enrollment has increased by 3.23 per cent and 
the average attendance by 4.53. Here the enrollment is equivalent to 
16.64 per cent of the population. 
Sufficient time has elapsed to determine the effect that remission of 
fees (laws of 1891, England; of 1889, and 1890, Scotland) has had upon 
school attendance.
-P-A-G-E-320
  
  _ 262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
As regards England, it was noted in the report for 1892-93 that the 
increase in the numbers on the school registers and the improvement in 
the regularity of attendance, as compared with the same for 1891-92, 
were nearly as much marked among the older children as among the 
“infants” (i. e., children under 7 years of age). 
Comparison of the statistics for 1893-94 with those of 1892-93 shows 
that the increase in the enrollment of older pupils surpassed that of the 
younger. 
The detailed statistics under this head are as follows: The number 
of infants on the registers has gone up from 1,813,992 to 1,830,994, an 
increase of 17,002 (0.94 per cent), and that of older children from 
3,312,381 to 3,367,747, an increase of 55,366 (1.67 per cent). The num- 
ber of infants in average attendance has risen from 1,278,798 to 
1,320,856, an increase of 42,058 (3.29 per cent), and that of older chil- 
dren in average attendance from 2,821,232 to 2,904,978, an increase of 
83,746 (2.97 per cent). 
In Scotland, where the school age is 5 to 14 (as against 3 to 14 in Eng- 
land), the attendance of younger children has never been large. Here 
it is observed that the remission of fees has increased the attendance 
of children of earlier years, and even brought into school many who are 
under school age. 
These results are sufficient to dispel the fears expressed in some 
quarters that parental interest in the education of children would 
decline with the relief from fees. 
FINANCES. 
The total income of elementary schools (evening included) for 1893-94 
was, in England, £9,178,178 ($44,661,014); in Scotland, £1,383,219 
($6,730,743.63), derived as follows:

The total expenditure in England was $44,513,316.45; in Scotland, 
$6,730,743.65. 
Tees remitted in Scotland by laws of 1889 and 1890 and in England 
by law of 1891 may still be charged if managers forego the fee grant . 
and parents make no objection. That free schools are generally desired 
is indicated by the fact that in England 82 per cent of elementary 
schools and in Scotland the entire number are now free for children of 
legal school age—3 to 14, inclusive, in the former; 5 to 14, inclusive, in 
the latter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND. 263 
Besides the proportional part of the current income furnished from 
local sources, as shown above, local managers must provide buildings 
and equipments. The general government has aided in this work by 
loans amounting in England to £29,468,477 5s. 8d. ($143,393,610.46), and 
in Scotland to £5,702,957 1s. 114d. ($27,750,593.63). 
RECENT MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION AND 
TO PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
The question of religious instruction in State-aided elementary 
schools, and in general that of the relation of the State to denomina- 
tional schools, is again disturbing England. 
The events of 1894 relating to this periodical agitation were set forth 
in the Commissioner’s report for 1892-93. The subject was reopened 
during that year by the efforts of certain members of the London school 
board to establish a religious test for teachers. The effort was appar- 
ently abandoned and the whole subject dropped as a consequence of the 
school board election. The constitution of the new board for London, 
which came into control of the schools in December, was sufficient proof 
that the endeavor to reopen tho religious controversy was not supported 
by the electors. The “ Progressives,” who oppose sectarian teaching, 
actually polled 150,000 more votes than their opponents, and the ma- 
jority of the latter in the board was reduced from 15 to 3, and even 
these were known to be opposed to any disturbance of the “ settlement 
of 1870.” So far as the London board was concerned, the discussions 
of the previous year had centered in “the test circular for teachers.” 
This circular explaified that the religious instruction allowed in board 
schools should be held to include ‘a belief in God the Father as our 
Creator, God the Son as our Redeemer, and God the Holy Ghost as our 
Sanctifier.” It stated, however, that teachers who could not conscien- 
tiously give the instruction in that sense might seek relief from the 
obligation. At the time the circular was issued (March, 1894) there 
were 8,902 teachers under the board giving religious instruction. Of 
these, 5,772 accepted the circular without protest, 6 applied individually 
for relief, and 3,127 applied collectively through the Metropolitan Board 
Teachers’ Association. The appeal in this form was disregarded by the 
board, but a second circular letter was addressed to the signers asking 
if they personally desired to be relieved from giving the religious 
instruction in the sense explained in the circular. To this inquiry 8 
responded affirmatively, 230 negatively, while 2,886 took no notice of 
the question. 
On account of the attitude assumed by the teachers in the last-named 
group, the promotion of one of the number was opposed by Mr. Athel- 
stan Riley, the author of the circular. His course in the matter was 
made the subject of investigation, and for several weeks excitement 
ran high in the board meetings and was reflected in the press.

  264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The endeavor of Mr. Riley ‘to carry on a private inquisition’ into 
the religious opinions of teachers was held to be a violation of a rule of 
the board, which reads as follows: 
The religious opinions of teachers are not to influence their selection, nomination, 
appointment, or promotion, nor are teachers or candidates for appointment as teach- 
ers to be subjected to any questions with reference to their religious belief or as to 
the possession or otherwise of certificates which might be taken as indicative of 
belonging to any particular denomination, nor are inquiries to be made into the 
religious beliefs of teachers, either by committees of the board, local managers, or 
by any other person having any connection with the board. 
Very few even of the Clerical party were prepared to defend Mr. 
Riley’s course and it was virtually condemned by an amendment to a 
resolution calling for his resignation from the committee on teachers, 
The amendment, which passed by a vote of 26 to 0, 10 members not 
voting, was as follows: : 
That the board is of opinion that any member who can not conscientiously act in 
the spirit of Rule 15 of the code of regulations should not serve upon the teaching 
staff subcommittee, and that the school management committee be informed of 
this resolution. 
While the matter was under discussion in the London board, the 
unexpected defeat of the Liberal party at the polls reopened for the en- 
tire country the question of public support for denominational schools. 
Leading conservative candidates for Parliament had made pledges in 
favor of additional aid to these schools from public funds. An impor- 
tant principle is here at stake—the appropriation of public money where 
public control can not be exercised. This principle is already strained 
in the grants made to denominational (i. e., voluntary) schools, and it is 
held by opponents that the policy should be abandoned instead of 
being extended. The admission of parochial schools to the benefit 
of local taxes would be resisted even more resolutely than a measure 
for increasing their resources from the public treasury. 
The short session of Parliament that followed the election gave no 
time for any positive action in the matter. Meanwhile both parties 
are deploying all their forces for the contest and the air is full of com- 
promise proposals. The importance of the principles and interests 
involved and the intense excitement which the controversy arouses 
will be best understood in the light of these proposals and the utter- 
ances which they have evoked. The watchword of the advocates of 
the denominational schools, “The intolerable strain to which these 
schools are now subjected,” was supplied by Mr. Balfour, the leader 
of the House of Commons, in a letter addressed to Lord Cranborne, 
August 22. The expression “intolerable strain” was immediately 
seized upon and has been the text of appeals and addresses ever since. 
Under this phrase the sum that churchmen pay for the privilege of 
controlling the education of 45 per cent of the school children is con- 
cealed. From a careful analysis of the figures it appears that out of 
every £2 paid for a child in a “voluntary school the country provides 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND. 265 
all but about 6 or 7 shillings—reckoning, of course, the fees paid by 
some of the children as part of the money paid by the country. Church 
voluntary contributions provide about three and sixpence in the pound, 
and it is by no means certain that the whole of what little money they 
have voluntarily contributed should all be accredited to elementary edu- 
cation.” In the letter already referred to Mr. Balfour not only gave 
expression to his personal desire to relieve the strain, but added, ‘this 
is, I believe, the general wish of the party and of the Government.” 
The premier, Lord Salisbury, since assuming the office, has defined 
his own position in the subject by referring to his speech made in May 
last, before the cabinet crisis. At that time he said: 
I do earnestly claim for the Church of England the right thai the parents who 
belong to the Church of England should bring up their children in their own way. 
Iclaim the same right for the Roman Catholics. I claim the same right for the 
Nonconformists. 
What I urge above all things is that each paremt should bring up his child in his 
own belief, undiminished and unquestioned, and should not attempt the impossi- 
ble—almost profane—task of trying to boil down different beliefs into one common 
profession. 
I earnestly press on all who hear me to value in the first instance, above all, that 
the children of all should be brought up to believe in the religion of their parents. 
Naturally with these assurances of support from the Government 
chiefs the Church party, which a few months since was facing the 
possibility of disestablishment, is aroused to a determined effort in 
behalf of its educational forces. 
The modes of relief proposed by the advocates of denominational 
schools as already stated are (1) increase of funds from the public 
treasury and (2) admission of denominational schools to a share in the 
local taxes (rates). Under the first head falls the bill proposed by “The 
National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of 
the Established Church.” 
This bill proposes— 
to treat all schools alike, whether board schools or voluntary; to abolish entirely 
what is called ‘‘payment by results” and to continue the fee-grant as at present, 
and to appropriate the only other Government grant to paying the salaries of 
teachers; all schools are still to pay from local sources (either subscriptions or rates) 
a fractional part of the salaries, at the rate of 5s. per head, upon the average attend- 
ance, the grant paying all the rest; and the teachers are to be appointed and con- 
trolled by the local managers, and may be dismissed by them, but with a right of 
appeal. 
A second scheme, submitted by an eminent churchman, simply pro- 
poses that the Government grant to all schools shall be increased by 
5s. per capita of average attendance. 
The Roman Catholic proposal calls for the support of elementary 
education in schools of all classes entirely from public funds, the addi- 
tional help required to come from the rates; gives to any person or 
persons “the power to found a new school in any school-board dis- 
trict if the parents of at least 30 children of school age desire it and 
ED 95: 9*  
-P-A-G-E-324
266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95, 
intend to use it; and it gives to every such school the right to claim 
and receive support both from the education department and from the 
rates.” 
All of the above proposals agree in opposing public control of sec- 
tarian schools. 
A species of representative management is indeed recognized in the 
Roman Catholic scheme by the provision “That the managers of such 
schools shall be representative by this way: That there shall be for 
every five managers two appointed by the parents of the scholars and 
three by the trustees or founders—none by the ratepayers as such.” 
Under any one of these proposals what is known as the 17s. 6d. limit 
would disappear; that is, the amount of Government grant to any 
school would no longer, as now, be limited to 17s. 6d. per capita of aver- 
age attendance, or to an amount equal to that from local sources, In 
other words, it would become possible for a denominational school to 
be supported wholly by grants. Compromise measures are offered also 
by the advocates of board schools, The National Union of Elementary 
Teachers proposes a new special grant of 10s. per head; this grant to 
be exempted from the operation of the 17s. 6d. limit, and all of it to be 
spent year by year upon the staff and appliances of the school. 
There should be no diminution of rates, fees, or subscriptions on 
account of this grant. 
Every voluntary school to have a “competent body of managers,” 
conducting their business in a formal manner approved by the Depart- 
ment, and, of them, a certain number or proportion to be nominated by 
the Education Department. 
Mr. Spottiswoode, well known in the educational world, submitted a 
bill, of which the main points are (1) that it provides for rate aid to 
all schools, and (2) ‘that it secures full denominational teaching on 
condition of representative management.” 
The determined attitude of the great religious bodies in the ques- 
tions at issue does not argue well for the ultimate permanent success 
of compromise measures. 
At the chureh congress held in October the report of a committee 
appointed by the archbishops to propose a plan for the further aid of 
voluntary schools was presented by the chairman, Canon Scott. “The 
committee were unanimous in agreeing that the voluntary schools 
should not be given up. They advised churchmen to demand the abo- 
lition of the 17s. 6d. and other limitations upon the grant earned, and 
the freeing of the school buildings from rates and taxes.” They also 
recommended further legislative facilities for the confederation of 
schools, i. e., to enable the church schools to help one another. The 
report then discusses three important questions: (1) The religious ques- 
tion; (2) The source of further financial aid; (3) The school board veto 
upon so-called “unnecessary” schools. On the first head the commit- 
tee held that the only course is to provide church schools for church
-P-A-G-E-325
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND. 267 
children, and Roman Catholic schools for Roman Catholic children, “ for 
thus only is it possible to secure that the teachers shall be appointed 
with a real care for their religious influence and teaching, as well as for 
their secular acquirements.” 
The second question, which followed directly from this, was the ques- 
tion of additional financial support. On this point Canon Scott said: 
The committee had before them every proposal for rate aid. Now, all rate-aid 
schemes fall under one of two heads—either a subvention from the rates by the local 
authority or the power to the ratepayer to allocate his share of the school rate to a 
particular school. It does not seem to me that the supporters of either of these pro- 
posals have worked out their plans completely. It has not been taken into account, 
that, except the large cities, very few towns can afford such an increase to the local 
rates. There is a further question. Rate aid involves representative management. 
No plan has yet been proposed which does not leave the representatives of the church 
in a minority upon the management. Rate aid having thus failed to provide a safe 
remedy for our troubles, the archbishops’ committee recommended an appeal for 
increased aid from the Imperial Government, such aid to go toward the teaching 
staff. This proposal has three great advantages. It would secure an adequate, 
proportionate, and fairly paid teaching staff in every school; it would effectually 
eliminate competition between board and voluntary schools in the only place where 
competition is of serious. consequence; it earmarks the Government grant so that the 
managers are simply the paymasters, and therefore they have no opportunity of 
abusing public money; they must put it to the purpose for which it was intended; 
and it avoids the question of representative management. 
The third point in the bill— 
is the liberty to open new schools whether they be actually new schools or the 
resumption of old schools previously handed over to a board, which would be tech- 
nically reckoned as new schools. In the opinion of the committee, this is at present 
the only satisfactory solution of ‘the religious difficulty—that is, to make religion 
one of the elements to be considered in deciding whether a school is necessary or 
unnecessary. There are some eases where the population is so small that this would 
not be possible. In such eases the religious difficulty might be entirely met by the 
school providing for all children who are not withdrawn, teaching such as a board 
school might give—Holy Scripture, the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer and the Ten 
Commandments, and then, in addition, giving to those children who claimed it 
the fuller teaching of the entire Catechism. Lastly, whatever is dene should be 
done so as to enable the schools in rural districts not only to provide better teachers, 
and pay them better, but also to improve their curricula and provide more oppor- 
tunities for-their scholars. 
The protest of the Congregational Union against the positions here 
assumed was expressed in the following resolution: 
That this assembly, feeling with ever-increasing force the importance of the edu- 
cation of the children of this country, and the need of watchful care, that the peo- 
ple from whose resources the cost of education is provided should haye a powerful 
voice in the government of all schools aided by public grants; mindful also of the 
extent to which the children of nonconformists are forced to attend schools under 
clerical control, is strenuously opposed to the proposals of the archbishops and the 
Roman Catholic committees to seek increased grants of public funds for schools 
under denominational management, and for teachers whose appointment or dismissal 
would be vested in unrepresentative bodies. The assembly can not but regard these 
proposals as an attempt, under the guise of assistance to so-called voluntary schools, 
to create a fresh endowment of religious denominations by the state. It trusts that
-P-A-G-E-326
268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
all Congregationalists will present a united front in resisting such proposals and 
will maintain the principle that schools supported by the people must be governed 
by the people. The assembly further recommends the appointment of a national 
committee, including representative men of every denomination in England and 
Wales, to resist any further endowment of sectarian schools out of taxes or rates, 
andto demand the extension of school boards throughout the country, with large 
areas of administration, and providing unsectarian schools within reach of the popu- 
lation. And the assembly instructs the committee of the union to take immediate 
action for the formation of such a national committee. 
The Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland and the Welsh 
Baptist Union were equally pronounced in their opposition. 
At the Grindelwald conference on the reunion of Christendom, the 
Rev. Hugh Price Hughes created great Cea by a proposal which 
he termed a “concordat.” It was as follows: 
That the Church of England should make its day schools truly national schools, 
free from denominational bias, and that, on the other hand, nonconformists should 
sanction the teaching of the Apostles’ Creed in all the schools of the country subject, 
of course, to a conscience clause. | 
Mr. Hughes added that he— | 
would further be prepared to support a proposal that all teachers that undertook 
religious teaching should be definitely trained in historical Christianity, by which 
he meant the Christianity of the Apostles’ Creed. They must tell Unitarians, Athe- 
ists, Agnostics, Jews, Mohammedans, and Theosophists, and any others who objected 
to such a proposal that the majority of Englishmen desired their children to have a 
Christian education; that they were sufficiently protected by the conscience clause, 
and that they could not be permitted to interfere with a great national scheme of 
education. 
‘No sooner was the “concordat” made public than it was repudiated 
on all sides by leading Methodists. 
Dr. Rigg, in protesting against the Hughes “concordat,” reiterates 
the resolution adopted by the Methodist Conference in 1891, which was 
as follows: 
That the primary object of Methodist policy in the matter of elementary education 
is the establishment of school beards everywhere, acting in districts of sufficient 
areas, and the placing of a Christian nonsectarian school within reasonable distance 
of every family. This is of special importance in the rural districts, where our 
people have no alternative to the compulsory attendance of their childrenat Anglican 
schools. 
The actual position of all nonconformists is plainly expressed by Dr. 
Parker, of London: 
The only way out of the religious difficulty in rate-supported schools is to withdraw 
religion from the control of the state. 
Outside of church orders the opposition to the inerease of clerical 
power in elementary schools is organized for effective manifestation. 
Although the National Union of Teachers has proposed a compromise 
measure, the association is fully committed to the policy of public con- 
trol where public funds are applied. Much more significant is the 
formation of the Birmingham Education League for the purpose of
-P-A-G-E-327

resisting all proposals for increased aid from “public funds to schools 
under private denominational management, on the ground that they 
reopen the educational settlement of 1870, and tend to arrest the 
growth of an universal system of education under the local control of 
the elected representatives of the ratepayers.” \ 
The leader of the movement is Mr. George Dixon, chairman of the 
Birmingham school board, who achieved a national reputation as pres- 
ident of the National Education League. This league was founded 
prior to 1870, and contended in Parliament and out of Parliament for 
a complete system of public secular free schools as against the compro- 
mises actually adopted. From this same league, which was dissolved 
nearly twenty years ago, also emanated the scheme of Bible reading, 
without note or comment adopted by many school boards of England. 
The new association is not like the old league, a national organ, but its 
spirit is contagious, as is shown by the conference held in London soon 
after the Birmingham meeting, over which Mr. Dixon was invited to 
preside. 
| It may be supposed that in the face of such opposition the Conserva- 
tive leaders will hesitate as to practical measures. The latest manifes- 
tation of the Government intentions was the speech of Lord Salisbury 
to the deputation headed by the archbishop of Canterbury, which 
sought audience in November to submit the memorial of the arch- 
bishop’s committee. 
In his address as reported in the Standard (London) Lord Salisbury 
said: 
I am naturally come here rather to listen to the speeches, and much of what has 
been under discussion is matter of departmental detail, with which I am not quali- 
fied to deal. Of course, I can not tell you what the intentions of the Government 
are, because, in the first instance, as you know, the matter is still under consideration 
by the Government and we could not speak with any distinctness or certainty. But 
we are deeply sensible of the extreme importance of the question you have brought 
before us. The presence of such a deputation as this would be sufficient to impress 
the matter upon our minds; and the circumstance alluded to by Sir Edward Clarke, 
as to the strong feeling in the country, naturally ought to have effect in inducing us 
to consider the question with great care, We are in a position of very great diffi- 
culty, and I must say—although I may be in a minority in saying so—largely in 
consequence of the omissions and defects of the act of 1870. I quite concur with 
those who have said that from the principles and structure of that act we can not 
now depart; but that does not prevent us from saying that in consequence of the 
oversights committed at that time much of the difficulty has arisen. That act was 
passed in a moment of considerable mental excitement, and largely founded upon 
enthusiasm and panic. There was a great desire on the part of the education 
department to take advantage of 2 moment which they thought might never recur 
to pass a measure, and there was a very great apprehension on the part of the 
friends of the church that if they did not pass that bill they might get something 
worse. In consequence of these two feelings, at a time when Parliament was very 
much occupied, sufficient consideration was not given to all the difficulties that 
might arise. After our experience, two main difficulties present themselves—that 
is, two on principal points in the working of the act which have hitherto been held 
to be fundamental principles in English legislation and administration. The board
-P-A-G-E-328
  270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
schools were set up to satisfy the crying need of supplying education where it did 
not exist. But the religious difficulty was, of course, very strongly felt. The 
answer was that there were voluntary schools beside the board schools, and that 
parents who did not like the education of the board schools would always have that 
resource, So long as the board schools did not act as an agency for exterminating 
voluntary schools, that answer was perfect and complete; but now you have compul- 
sory education, so that every parent must send his child to school, and you have in 
operation machinery which seems destined at no very distant period to remove a 
great number of the schools where the parent has found the religious education he 
desires. Of course, since 1870 there has sprung up a sort of defense of the system 
under which we are now proceeding. We are assured that the board schools are 
really teaching the religion we ought to believe in. The Roman Catholics are not 
represented in this room, and do not appear to this memorial, but their feelings and 
desires in the matter will have to be considered, and they have always repudiated 
most indignantly the idea that the religion taught in the board schools is the 
religion which they recognize. The objection on the part of members of the Church 
of England is not so intense and not so universal, but still it is very strong indeed, 
and, so far as I am able to judge, it is growing, not weakening, both in area and in 
intensity. 
The Nonconformists are well satisfied with the religious teaching in the board 
schools. I do not grudge them the advantages they have and desire, in obtaining at 
the public cost a system of religious teaching which is practically their own. Ido 
not begrudge them, and I earnestly hope that they will always have that facility; 
but I desire that other religious bodies should have it, too. That is why, from the 
point of view of religious liberty, we desire, so far as we can do it, to assist the 
voluntary schools in their trouble and to take the stress off them under which they 
are now sufiering. But there is another evil that was not foreseen when the act of 
1870 was passed. That is, you have confided the spending of the ratepayers’ money 
to a body which, by its constitution, has a great interest in the expenditure, but has 
very little interest in frugality. We do not have this in any other part of our system, 
It is quite true that the school boards are very earnest educationalists, and all the 
members of the boards, of course, are so. I admire the motives which induced them 
. to spend so much money as they have spent, but of course those who have to furnish 
the money do not feel that admiration in an unqualified degree. Just apply that to 
some general department of expenditure with which we are not so familiar. We 
know that nothing can be more upright than the desires for expenditure which are 
entertained by the military offices. The military office wishes to make its institution 
as useful and valuable and extensive as possible. It has that desire constantly before 
its mind. Conceive, if there was no treasury to keep the war office from gratifying 
its desire to the utmost limit of its wishes; conceive, if there was no treasury to 
prevent the war office from drawing upon the taxpayers as largely as the head of the 
department could wish in order to make his department as perfect as possible! That ; 
is exactly what you are doing in the case of these school boards. I feelthat some check | 
is necessary, and I sympathize with those who look upon this matter from a religious 
standpoint. I look also with great sympathy on the subject from the ratepayers’ 
point of view. I can not help thinking that there has been expenditure, both of a 
character and upon a class, which was not intended by those who originally passed 
the education act, and which would have becn repudiated by many. Some check is 
neeessary. I observe what the archbishop said in regard to the unanimity with 
which his friends had adopted the principal recommendations that have been put 
forward. There is a great deal to be said for them, and I will not say a word against 
them, They solve all these difficulties by assuming that the chancellor of the 
exchequer is the point of least resistance. The proposal is able and ingenious, and, 
like all ingenious and able proposals, itis exceedingly simple. Although I donot now 
express any opinion, I venture to warn his grace that the chancellor of the exchequer 
is the lion inthe path. Iearnestly hope his grace may be—I am sure he is—animated
-P-A-G-E-329
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND. 271 
by liberal and sympathetic feelings toward all the voluntary schools, and I hope 
that his feelings may be supported by the possession of unbounded means for carrying 
them out. But upon that subject I am of course wholly unable to speak. We must 
do what we can. What we can do, we must do quickly. Wo must not despair if we 
find that time is necessary in order to give us command of the sinews of war. I can 
only assure you that not only do I feel very strongly the claims of the voluntary 
schools, but they are felt by the whole party. Though I think that the unanimity 
which your grace alluded to gives value to the recommendations, still the great 
object you have in view is the great object not only of the church, but of the party 
now in the majority in the Houseof Commons. I can only assure you that our efforts 
will be directed to securing the best and most efficient means which the circumstances 
of the times will allow us to apply in order to remedy the grievances complained of, 
The week following this important conference the premier received a 
second deputation on the same subject, namely, that of the Wesleyan 
Methodists. 
Less imposing in its array of dignitaries than the Anglican depu- 
tation, it represented a political force not to be ignored. 
That Lord Salisbury might be duly impressed with this fact, a few 
statistics relative to the denomination had been presented to him before 
the conference. These set forth that “the number of sittings provided 
in Wesleyan Methodist chapels in England and Wales is 2,146,000; the 
number of Sunday schools, 7,096; the number of Sunday scholars, 
965,222; the number of day-school departments, 786; the number of 
scholars therein, 168,616.” The memorial of the Wesleyans was long, 
but its position is summed up in a few words: “ That there should be no 
increased grant of public funds, either from the local rates or from the 
imperial taxes, to denominational schools, unless that increased grant 
is accompanied by adequate and representative public management.” 
As to the conscience clause which, it has been assumed, protects the 
religious scruples of parents, the following resolution was submitted: 
The experience of twenty years has shown that the conscience clause has to a 
considerable extent proved to be ineffectual and unreal as a protection for parents 
and children against religious intolerance and oppression; that, moreover, in not a 
few day schools of the Church of England religious intolerance and bigotry of an 
exceedingly offensive character are systematically taught the scholars, during the 
hours set apart for religious instruction, by means of a special catechism, such as it 
ought not to be possible to teach in connection with any public school of the nation; 
and that the way of appeal to the education department against such grievances is 
difficult, tedious, and often altogether unavailable. This committee therefore 
would strongly urge upon the Government that the local education authority, 
which is responsible for enforcing educational compulsion on children and their 
parents, should have authority to take cognizance of any complaints which may be 
made by parents or guardians of offenses against conscience or religious liberty in 
the conduct of any inspected school, and may make representations on the subject 
either to the managers of the school or to the education department, or to both 
these authorities, as the case may require. 
The same resolution was aimed also at the evil of unsanitary school 
premises, which is a standing cause of complaint in rural districts. The 
clause relating to this matter was as follows: 
Further, it shall be within the competency of the same local authority to take 
cognizance of the sanitary conditions of the schools within their districts which it
-P-A-G-E-330
272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
may be their duty to require children to attend, and to make representations on this 
subject to the managers of any school or to the education department, or to both 
these authorities. 
Recalling the watchword supplied by Mr. Balfour to the Church 
party, Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, in the course of the conference, set 
forth “the intolerable strain” which the Wesleyans bear. As reported 
by the School Guardian, he stated— 
that there were at least 850,000 Wesleyan Methodist children in this country who 
were not in their own day schools, because they lived in localities where Wesleyan 
day schools did not exist. There were upward of 10,000 parishes, chiefly in the 
rural districts, where the only day school was the Anglican school, although, as had 
been stated, in some of these cases the children of Wesleyan Methodist parents 
were in a majority. In one district in Lincolnshire, for example, there were ina 
certain school 188 children, 49 of whom were Anglicans and 139 Methodists. That 
was by no means an exceptional case in that part of the country. Unhappily, in 
present circumstances, they were in the painful position that their children were by 
law compelled to go to schools where much was taught them to which their parents 
conscientiously objected. If the case were reversed and Churchmen were placed 
in such a position in relation, say, to the Baptists, he thought that Her Majesty’s 
Government would soon find a remedy. 
Lord Salisbury, in his reply, asserted that his remedy for the relig- 
ious difficulty would be “simply the multiplication of denominational 
schools.” He added further: 
If I understand aright the position of a large number of people, it is that they 
energetically repudiate the idea that there is, in any sense of the word in which it 
has been used, 1 common ground of religious education by which only a portion of 
that religious education can be taken out and the rest given in its place. I am not 
asking whether they are right or wrong; but I again ask you to look at it from a 
political point of view—the view of the statesman or politician who wishes to know 
how the currents of opinion aro trending—and I think you will find I am right in 
saying that the objection to leave out what Dr. Rigg would call the indifferent parts 
of Anglican teaching is very much more intense now than it was thirty years ago, 
and that the difficulty, therefore, of providing what is called unsectarian religion 
that shall be sufficient for all kinds of religious belief has increased enormously in 
recent years, and my impression is that itis going on increasing. The tendency of 
discussion must be to make it increase; and therefore I look with considerable doubt 
and apprehension at this idea, which I am afraid many of you possess, that it is pos- 
sible to solve all our difficulties by forcing all children into one common school where 
they should be taught what may be called the residuum of religious education. 
As to the resolution quoted above, he said: 
May I say one word as to resolution No. 9, which, I confess, I read with sorrow? 
In that resolution the Wesleyan Conference says that ‘religious intolerance and 
bigotry of an exceedingly offensive character are systematically taught the scholars 
during the hours set apart for religious instruction by means of a special catechism.” 
Now, I think that that statement ought to be reconsidered. If a Jew or a Roman 
Catholic insists upon teaching the religion which he believes, you only say that it 
is a legitimate and praiseworthy exercise of his just liberty; if a Scotch Presby- 
terian insists upon teaching the Westminster Confession you pass the same judgment 
upon him; but if a Church of England clergyman insists upon teaching what he 
believes, you denounce him as being guilty of religious intolerance and bigotry. I 
have no doubt that those observations were made in perfect sincerity and with the
-P-A-G-E-331

highest motive, but on behalf of the Church of England I must say that I do not 
think that they are just, and I do not think that in the meeting of a week ago, to 
which allusion has been made, any such judgment on our Nonconformist brethren 
would have been passed. 
In conclusion, the premier expressed the hope that— 
we shall all earnestly try to keep them apart from political bias and do what we can 
to solve one of the most difficult problems which ever beset any community ina 
manner which shall be favorable, not only to the highest interests of education, but 
also to religion itself. (From report of the conference, in the School Guardian, 
November 30, 1895, pp. 943-944.) 
All question as to the actual purposes of the Conservative govern- 
ment in respect to the pledges made to the advocates of clerical schools 
has been answered by the education bill, a copy of which has been 
received as this matter comes from press. The bill was presented by 
Sir John Gorst March 31, 1896, and carried through the second reading 
May 5 by a majority of 267. It is the first measure presented with any 
prospect of success since 1870 which advocates a distinct departure 
from the settlement effected by the education law of that year. 
The radical changes in the existing system that it contemplates are 
comprised in the following proposals: 
(1) For the creation of a new local educational authority by appoint- 
ment of the county council, secondary and elementary education both 
to be included in its province; the same, however, to supplement not 
supersede such existing organizations for educational purposes as “‘sup- 
ply efficient instruction.” 
(2) Transfer to the same of the routine work of the central education 
department, i. e., distribution of public grants for education, inspection 
of schools, etc., leaving the department to act as a court of appeal. 
(3) Measures for preventing increase of school boards and absorbing 
those that exist. 
(4) An extra parliamentary grant to be given alike to private (vol- 
untary schools) and the poorer board schools at the rate of 4s. per 
capita of attendance. 
(5) The abolition of the existing limit of the government grant to 
17s. 6d. per capita of attendance. 
(6) Exemption of school property from rating (local property tax). 
(7) Introduction of sectarian instruction into public elementary 
schools. 
The opposition to the bill is so intense and determined that in spite 
of the great majority which the government controls in the house 
it is likely to be modified in all essential particulars if not actually 
withdrawn.

CHAPTER VII. 
MANITOBA SCHOOL CASE, 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.! 
Through the courtesy of school officials in Canada this office is able 
to present a statement of the legal status of the Manitoba school case. 
The local conditions under which schools must be maintained, natu- 
rally, are not touched upon in that document; for a clearer understand- 
ing of the circumstances to which it pertains, these are here briefly 
considered. 
In addition to the exigencies of a sparse and scattered population, 
and a severe winter climate, the peculiar character of the population 
must be taken into account. The census of 1891 showed 152,506 inhab- 
itants in an area of 64,066 square miles, giving an average density of 
24a square mile. In the ten years 1881-1891, the population had in- 
ereased by 145 per cent; 69 per cent of the population at the later date 
were natives of British America. Of the foreign born, the largest 
contingent were natives of Ireland. 
Considered as to religion, Roman Catholics numbered 20,571, or 135 
per cent of the total population, and the Mennonites, a German sect 
who originally came to Canada from southern Russia, about two-thirds 
asmany. Adherents of the Church of England formed 20 per cent of 
the population; Presbyterians, 25.5 per cent; Methodists, 18.5 per cent, 
and Baptists 10 per cent. 
Rural life predominates, cities comprising less than one-fourth of the 
people (22.5 per cent). Winnipeg, the capital of the Province, had 
25,642 inhabitants in 1891. 
In spite of the many obstacles in the way, the increase of school 
facilities has been very marked. In the decade 1884-1894, while the 
school population increased by 195 per cent, the number of schools 
inereased by 245 per cent, the teachers by 325 per cent, enrollment by 
201 per cent, average attendance by 320 per cent, and the expenditure 
on public education by 113 per cent.

The amount of debenture indebtedness was $655,723, and the value of the school sites, houses, and 
furniture was estimated at $975,112. 
The conditions under which the rapidly increasing schools are main- 
tained are indeed unique. The Reverend Principal Grant, of Queen’s 
College, Kingston, who has made many tours of the Province, the last 
in the fall of 1895, writes: 
In not a few sections the winters are so severe that the schools are closed from 
December to April, and partly to make up for that there is no midsummer vacation. 
In one township (an area of 8 or 10 square miles, with a population of 
from 3,000 to 6,000) he found but one school, ‘and therefore some of the 
scholars have to walk more than 3 miles to reach the school.” He adds: 
The whole number of scholars is 12 and the attendance is sometimes 2, WhenI 
visited it the other day 6 were present. The teacher seemed to me a governess 
instructing the children of one family, for the 6 were of different ages, and there 
were three or four reading classes. 
The mixture of languages encountered almost everywhere reaches the 
extreme in Winnipeg. Writing from the capital, Principal Grant says: 
I visited two representative schools the other day. The North Central, having 
eleven spacious class rooms crowded with 600 pupils, and beside it the modest little 
frame building called the School of the Immaculate Conception, in which the Sisters 
of Jesus and Mary teach 90 additional pupils—the one a public school, the other once 
public, but struck down by the act of 1890. In the little two-roomed school thirteen 
nationalities sit side by side—English (including Scotch, Irish, and Welsh), English-
-P-A-G-E-335
THE MANITOBA SCHOOL CASE, 277 
Canadian, French-Canadian, Métis (half-breeds), Cree (an Indian tribe), German, 
Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, and Syrian—all being 
ground up into Canadian. Allare drilled in English up to the second reader, and 
after that point has been reached an hour and a quarter a day is given to drilling in 
French. In the big public school hard by, in addition to the thirteen nationalities 
mentioned, there are Jews, Icelanders, Finlanders, and negroes. In this school 
English is the sole language of instruction. Be itnoted that there is not the slightest 
language or religious difficulty in either school, though religious exercises are held 
in both. The Sisters are excellent teachers in all the usual subjects. 
In the public school every room is closed with the religious exercise prescribed by 
the advisory board—that is, the reading of a passage of Scripture and prayer. I 
asked the principal whether many of his 600 pupils retired before these exercises 
commenced. He seemed almost astonished at the question. ‘They never thought 
of such a thing.” 
The necessity for making English the language of the schools and 
yet of preserving for the natives of French descent their mother tongue 
is readily recognized. Beyond this there is no special language prob- 
lem. Of the Icelanders Principal Grant observes: 
They have so little desire to preserve their own language in the new home which 
they have chosen that they prefer English to Icelandic teachers, even on their reservo 
at Gimli. Such an attitude shows their good sense, but it is to be remembered that 
they have no racial or religious difficulties worth speaking of to overcome. They 
are not part of a famous nation with a great literature; besides, they are Protes- 
tants, and without the extreme Puritanism and Quakerism of the Mennonites. 
The difficulties of obtaining properly qualified teachers, which is 
experienced in all newly settled regions, is increased in Manitoba by 
several circumstances, among which the bilingual requirement is not 
the least. 
The Mennonites [writes our author] need teachers able to converse and teach in 
German and English. The Métis and French-Canadians require teachers who can 
converse and teach in French and English. Bilingual readers are helpful, but in 
practice they amount to nothing unless the teachers can use both languages freely. 
This is Manitoba’s crux. # # . * * * * 
I may mention here that I visited one rural school in Manitoba, in an English- 
speaking Protestant district, where a genuine surprise and a rare pleasure awaited 
me. The teacher was aided in his work by an excellent wife, and, both being able to 
speak German fluently, they asked permission from the trustees to teach the scholars 
in both languages, assuring them that it would be to their advantage even in learn- 
ing English. The district being near a Mennonite reserve, where it was apparent 
that a knowledge of German would be useful, the trustees and parents consented, 
and now all the children in that school are learning the two languages and finding 
the work a pleasure as well as a profit. I hope to see the day when we shall have 
hundreds of such teachers in our common schools. A supply of teachers of that kind 
would soon settle the real educational question of Manitoba, but they are not to be 
had unless special means are taken to get them; such means, for instance, as accept- 
ing university graduates for common schools, as they are accepted in Scotland; the 
employment of a teacher in the normal school whose sole business it would be to 
train candidates to teach in both languages, and the granting of a bonus or an addi- 
tion to the salary of every teacher passing a satisfactory examination in both lan- 
guages and thereafter obtaining a school in either a French or a German district.
-P-A-G-E-336
278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Persistent efforts have been made to overcome these difficulties in 
the Mennonite districts by Rev. Mr. Ewert, a minister of the order who 
came from Kansas and was appointed special school inspector. 
Mr. Ewert is employed by an association of religious, patriotic Mennonites to teach 
a kind of provisional normal school in Gretna, and from this school a gradually 
increasing supply of young Canadian Mennonite teachers will be obtained. Already 
it has sent out about a dozen, but Mr. Ewert frankly confesses that not one of them 
could get a third-class teachers’ certificate, When his pupils are nearing that point 
they are eagerly sought for either by the private schools or by public-school trustees, 
and the youths can not resist the temptation of getting a salary and saving up 
money enough to enable them subsequently to attend his school without being an 
expense to their parents. 
* * * * * * ” 
It may be asked here why, seeing that the training of teachers is one of the func- 
tions of the Government, this association should have the burden laid on it of pay- 
ing the only Mennonite normal-school teacher in the Province. The answer will be 
satisfactory to those who maintain that the state is an organism which must abstain 
from doing work necessary to its own well being rather than be unfaithful in any 
respect to a modern view of the relations of church and state. The Mennonites, 
whether public or private school supporters, insist that their teachers shall be trained 
in the Mennonite faith, so that they may be able to teach it to the children. Tho 
Government can not undertake to do that, and therefore would have to stand help- 
lessly by and do nothing were it not for the voluntary Mennonite association, which 
benevolently has the same object in view—a supply of good teachers acceptable to 
the people. Mr. Ewert teaches not only the so-called secular branches, but also the 
Scriptures, and, being a duly ordained Mennonite minister, he has the confidence of 
that portion of them who are in favor of the public-school system, though he is 
regarded by many of the orthodox as a dangerous man, who is likely to lead their 
youth astray. Notwithstanding his being a suspect to this extent, the superiority 
of those trained by him over the old-fashioned teachers is so manifest that the mana- 
gers of the private schools are engaging as many of them as they can get. It comes 
to this: That a little training is better than none, and that while what is practically 
a Mennonite church attends to that, the Government cooperates with it by paying 
half the salary of the teacher, paying him, however, not as a teacher, but as 
inspector of the Mennonite schools. 
The Government has done much also to secure good teaching. A 
normal school is maintained at Winnipeg, and in 1894 there were also 
twelve provincial and local normal schools—or institutes, perhaps we 
should call them. These had 75 students in vatiendance at long sessions 
and 124 at short sessions. 
The Government also pursues a liberal policy in respect to salaries. 
An annual grant of $130 for each public-school teacher is made by the 
legislature, and from $200 to $400 from the municipality, to which the 
district may add as much as the trustees think proper to ask the council 
to assess. ‘ 
In his final report embodying the results of his mission Principal 
Grant thus sums up his opinion on the question at issue between the 
provincial and the Dominion Government: 
While the Province is morally bound to take action to meet the decision of the 
privy council and restore their educational rights to the Catholics, the Dominion 
Parliament should, nevertheless, not obtrude on the provincial domain, as provincial 
rights are the keystone of the constitution.

  THE MANITOBA SCHOOL CASE. 279 
THE PRESENT ISSUE, 
By Henry R. Atupy, Secretary to the Minister of Education for the Province of 
Ontario. 
By an act of the Imperial House of Commons known as the British 
North America act, 1867, the provinces of Upper Canada, Lower 
Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, forming part of the British 
territories of North America, were federally united under the title of 
the “Dominion of Canada.” Since the date of that act (1867) the 
Dominion has been enlarged easterly by the addition of Prince Edward 
Island, and westerly by the addition of British Columbia and the acqui- 
sition of the lands known as the Northwest Territories, and sometimes 
as the Hudson Bay Territories. These lands embrace all the country 
lying between the Rocky Mountains and the Lake of the Woods. Out 
of this territory, in 1870, the Province of Manitoba was laid out and 
given the same status as any other Province in the federal system of 
Canada. 
By the act of confederation every Province was endowed with certain 
exclusive powers of self-government similar to the powers of sovereignty 
enjoyed by the States of the American Republic. In some other mat- 
ters the power of the Central Government was supreme. Owing, 
however, to the contention between Protestants and Catholics for many 
years over the question of separate schools, the federal act, as will be 
seen more fully later on, authorized the Central Government to super- 
sede, if need be, the legislation of any Province in matters of education. 
This power the Central Government could exercise in favor of either 
Catholies or Protestants, and was only to be invoked when it was clear 
that the interests of the minority of any Province were prejudicially 
affected in educational matters by local legislation. These powers are 
described in the confederation act as powers of “remedial legislation,” 
and apply not only to the Provinces forming part of the original federa- 
tion but to others subsequently added, so that when a Province estab- 
lished separate schools after it became part of the federation the 
Dominion Government would have the right to consider to what extent 
the powers conferred upon them could be interfered with by the subse- 
quent legislation of the Province. The statutes bearing upon the 
question are as follows: 
Section 93 of the British North America act, 1867, provides as fol- 
lows: 
In and for each Province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to 
education, subject and according to the following provisions: 
(1) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with 
respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law in the 
Province of the Union. 
(2) All the powers, privileges, and duties at the Union by law conferred and 
imposed in Upper Canada on the separate schools and school trustees of the Queen’s
-P-A-G-E-338
280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Roman Catholic subjects shall be, and the same are hereby, extended to the dissen- 
tient schools of the Queen’s Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec. 
(3) Where in any Provinco a system of separate or dissentient schools exists by law 
at the Union, or is thereafter established by the legislature of the Province, an 
appeal shall lie to the Governor-General in council from any act or decision of any 
provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman 
Catholic minority of the Queen’s subjects in relation to education. 
(4) In ease any such provincial law, as from time to time seems to the Governor- 
General in council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of this section, is 
not made, or in case any decision of the Governor-General in council on any appeal 
under this section is not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that 
behalf, then, and in every such case, and as far only as the circumstances of each 
case require, the Parliament of Canada may make remedial laws for the due execu- 
tion of the provisions of this section, and of any decision of the Governor-General in 
council under this section. 
Section 22 of the Manitoba act, 1870, provides as follows: 
In and for the Province, the said legislature may exclusively make laws in relation 
to education, subject and according to the following provisions: 
(1) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with 
respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice 
in the Province at the Union. 
(2) An appeal shall lie to the Governor-General in council from any act or decision 
of the legislature of the Province, or of any provincial authority, affecting any right 
or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen’s subjects in 
relation to education. 
(3) In case any such provincial law, as from time to time seems to the Governor- 
General in council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of this section, is 
not made, or in case any decision of the Governor-General in council on any appeal 
under this section is not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that 
behalf, then, and in every such case, and as far only as the circumstances of each 
case require, the Parliament of Canada may make remedial laws for the due execu- 
tion of the provisions of this section and of any decision of the Governor-General in 
council under this section. 
It would appear, therefore, that the Manitoba act of 1870, like the 
act establishing confederation, intended to confer upon the minority 
the right to establish separate schools—that is, schools where religious 
instruction could be given to the pupils under such regulations as the 
government of the Province for the time being thought proper, the 
provisions of which may now be considered. For instance, the Mani- 
toba school act of 1871 provided for a board of education of not less 
than ten nor more than fourteen members, of whom one-half were to 
be Protestants and the other half Catholics. The two sections of the 
board might meet at any time separately. Each section was to choose 
a chairman, and to have under its control and management the disci- 
pline of the schools of the section. One of the Protestant members was 
to be appointed superintendent of the Protestant schools, and one of 
the Catholic members superintendent of the Catholic schools, and these 
two were to be the joint secretaries of the board, which was to select 
the books to be used in the schools, except those having reference to 
religion or morals, which were to be prescribed by the sections respect- 
ively, The legislative grant for common-school education was to be

appropriated, one moiety to support the Protestant, the other moiety 
the Catholic schools. Certain districts in which the population was 
mainly Catholic were to be considered Catholic school districts, and 
certain other districts where the population was mainly Protestant 
were to be considered Protestant school districts. Every year a meet- 
ing of the male inhabitants of each district, summoned by the Superin- 
tendent of the section to which the district belonged, was to appoint 
trustees, and to decide whether their contributions to the support of 
the schools were to be raised by subscription, by a collection of a rate 
per scholar, or by assessment on the property of the district. They 
might also decide to erect a schoolhouse, and that the cost of it should 
be raised by assessment. In case the father or guardian of a school 
child was a Protestant in a Catholic district, or vice versa, he might 
send the child to the school of the nearest district of the other section, 
and in case he contributed to the school the child attended a sum equal 
to what he would have been bound to pay if he had belonged to that 
district, he was exempt from payment to the school of the district in 
which he lived. 
Acts amending the education law in some respects were passed in 
subsequent years, but it is not necessary to refer to them, as in 1881 
the act of 1871 and these amending acts were repealed. The Manitoba 
school act of 1881 followed the same general lines as that of 1871. 
The number of the board of education was fixed at not more than 21, 
of whom 12 were to be Protestants and 9 Catholics. If a less number 
were appointed the same relative proportion was to be observed. The 
board, as before, was to resolve itself into two sections, Protestant and 
Catholic, each of which was to have the control of the schools of its sec- 
tion, and all the books to be used in the schools under its control were 
now to be selected by each section. There were to be, as before, a Prot- 
estant and a Catholic superintendent. It was provided that the estab- 
lishment of a school district of one denomination should not prevent 
the establishment of a school district of the other denomination in the 
same place, and that a Protestant and Catholic district might include 
the same territory in whole or in part. The sum appropriated by the 
legislature for common-school purposes was to be divided between the 
Protestant and Roman Catholic sections of the board in proportion to 
the number of children between the ages of 5 and 15 residing in the 
various Protestant and Roman Catholic school districts in the province 
where schools were in operation. Withregard to local assessments for 
school purposes, it was provided that the ratepayers of a school dis- 
trict should pay their respective assessments to the schools of their 
respective denominations, and in no case was a Protestant ratepayer to 
be obliged to pay for a Catholic school or a Catholic ratepayer for a 
Protestant school. 
The scheme embodied in this act was modified in some of its details 
by later acts of the legislature. but they did not affect in substance
-P-A-G-E-340
ee 
282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-95. 
the main features, to which attention has been called. While traces of 
the increase of the Protestant relatively to the Catholic population 
may be seen in the course which legislation took, the position of the 
Protestant and Catholic portions of the community in relation to edu- 
cation was not substantially altered, though the State aid, which at the 
outset was divided equally between them, had, of course, to be adjusted 
and made proportionate to the school population which each supplied. 
Passing now to the department of education, we find that the public- 
schools act of 1890 wrought a great change. Under the former of 
these, Roman Catholics were not entitled as such to any representation 
on the board of education or on the advisory board, which was to 
authorize text-books for the use of pupils and to prescribe the form of 
religious exercises to be used in schools. All Protestant and Catholic 
school districts were to be subject to the provisions of the public- 
schools act. The public schools were to be free and entirely nonsec- 
tarian. No religious exercises were to be allowed unless conducted 
according to the regulations of the advisory board and with the 
authority of the school trustees for the district. It was made the duty 
of the trustees to take possession of all public-school property which 
had been acquired or given for public-school purposes in the district. 
The municipal council of every city, town, and village was directed to 
levy and collect upon the taxable property within the municipality 
such sums as might be required by the public-school trustees for school 
purposes. No municipal council was to have the right to exempt any 
property whatever from school taxation; and it was expressly enacted 
that any school not conducted according to all the provisions of the 
act or the regulations of the department of education or the advisory 
board should not be deemed a public school within the meaning of the 
law, and that such school should not participate in the legislative 
grant. 
Memorials and petitions were presented to the Governor-General of 
Canada in council, and by many other Roman Catholic inhabitants of 
the Provinee, on behalf of the Roman Catholic minority of the Queen’s 
subjects in the Province, by way of appeal from the two acts of Mani- 
toba of 1890 before referred to, which petitions prayed as follows: 
(1) That Your Excellency the Governor-General in council may entertain the said 
appeal, and may consider the same, and may make such provision and give such 
directions for the hearing and consideration of the said appeal as may be thought 
roper. 
® () That it may be declared that the said acts (53 Vic., chaps. 37, 38) do preju- 
dicially affect the rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which 
Roman Catholics had by law or practice in the Province at the Union. 
(3) That it may be declared that the said last-mentioned acts do affect the rights 
and privileges of the Roman Catholic minority of the Queen’s subjects in relation 
to education. 
(4) That it may be declared that to Your Excellency the Governor-General in coun- 
cilit seems requisite that the provisions of the statutes in force in the Province of 
Manitoba prior to the passage of the said acts should be reenacted in so far at least
-P-A-G-E-341

as may be necessary to secure to the Roman Catholics in the said Province the right 
to build, maintain, equip, manage, conduct, and support these schools in the manner 
provided for by the said statutes, to secure to them their proportionate share of any 
grant made out of the public funds for the purposes of education, and to relieve such 
members of the Roman Catholic Church as contribute to such Roman Catholic 
schools from all payment or contribution to the support of any other schools, or that 
the said acts of 1890 should be so modified or amended as to effect such purposes. 
(5) And that such further or other declaration or order may be made as to Your 
Excellency the Governor-General in council shall, under the circumstances, seem 
proper, and that such directions may be given, provisions made, and all things done 
in tho premises for the purpose of affording relief to the said Roman Catholic minority 
in the said Province as to your excellency in council may seem meet. 
The case then was referred to the supreme court of Canada, by which 
ease various questions were submitted for the opinion of the court. 
These were as follows: 
(41) Is the appeal referred to in the said memorials and petitions, and asserted 
thereby, such an appeal as is admissible by subsection 3 of section 93 of the British 
North America act, 1867, or by subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba act (33 Vie. 
(1870), chap. 3, Canada)? 
(2) Are the grounds set forth in the petitions and memorials such as may be the 
subject of appeal under the authority of the subsections above referred to, or either 
of them? 
(8) Does the decision of the judicial committee of the privy council in the cases 
of Barrett v. The City of Winnipeg and Logan v. The City of Winnipeg dispose of or 
conclude the application for redress based on the contention that the rights of the 
Roman Catholic minority which accrued to them after the Union under the statutes 
of tho Province have been interfered with by the two statutes of 1890, complained 
of in the said petitions and memorials. 
(4) Does subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America act 1867, apply 
to Manitoba? 
(5) Has his excellency the Governor-General in council power to make the decla- 
rations or remedial orders which are asked for in the said memorials and petitions, 
assuming the material facts to be as stated therein, or has his excellency the Governor- 
General in council any other jurisdiction in the premises? 
(6) Did the acts of Manitoba relating to education, passed prior to the session of 
1880, confer on or continue to the minority a right or privilege in relation to educa- 
tion within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba act, or estab- 
lish a system of separate or dissentient schools within the meaning of subsection 3 
of section 93 of the British North America act, 1867, if said section 93 be found to be 
applicable to Manitoba; and if so, did the two acts of 1890 complained of, or either 
of them, affect any right or privilege of the minority in such a manner that an appeal 
will lie thereunder to the Governor-General in council. 
In regard to this question the supreme court were divided, three of 
the judges out of the five giving a negative answer to all the questions. 
The Roman Catholics then appealed to the judicial committee of the 
privy council, the highest court in the British Empire, against the 
supreme court of Canada, and, after argument before the privy council, 
judgment was given in January last to the effect that the Governor- 
General in council had jurisdiction to make remedial orders or declara- 
tions, and that the appeal was well founded. The privy council further 
stated that it was not essential that the statutes of Manitoba repealed 
by the act of 1890 should be reenacted, or that the precise provisions of
-P-A-G-E-342
284 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-95. 
these acts should again be made law; or, in other words, the privy 
council said that it was not absolutely necessary to restore the separate- 
school system which was abolished by the public-schools act of 1890, 
in the form in which it previously existed, but that the system of 
1890 might be supplemented by provisions which would remove the 
grievance of which the Roman Catholics complained. 
On the receipt of the judgment of the privy council the Governor- 
General of Canada, on the advice of his council, passed a remedial 
order, which sets forth that it seems requisite that the system of educa- 
tion embodied in the two acts of 1890 should be supplemented by a 
provincial act or acts which would restore to the Roman Catholic 
minority the rights and privileges of which they were deprived by the 
act of 1890 so far, and so far only, as may be necessary to enable them 
(a) to build, maintain, equip, manage, conduct, and support Roman 
Catholic schools in the manner provided for by the said statutes which 
were repealed by the two acts of 1890; (b) the right to share propor- 
tionately in any grant made out of the public funds for the purposes of 
education; (¢) the right of exemption of the supporters of such Roman 
Catholic schools from all payment or contribution to the support of any 
other schools. 
The following is the text of the remedial order of the government of 
the Dominion of Canada. As this document is of considerable impor- 
tance, I quote it in full: 
Whereas on the 26th day of November, 1892, a petition by way of appeal, under 
the provisions of section 22 of chapter 3 of the acts of the Parliament of Canada, 
passed in the thirty-third year of Her Majesty’s reign, and entitled an act to amend 
and continue the act 32-33 Victoria, chapter 3, and to establish and provide for the 
government of the Province of Manitoba (commonly called the Manitoba act), and 
confirmed by ‘The British North America act, 1871, ” was presented to his excellency 
the Governor-General of Canada, by and on behalf of the Roman Catholic minority 
of Her Majesty’s subjects in the Province of Manitoba, which petition, among other 
things, alleged in effect that by certain acts of the legislature of the Province of 
Manitoba passed after the Union and by an act passed by the said legislature in 
the forty-fourth year of Her Majesty’s reign, chapter 4, which may be cited as “‘ The 
Manitoba school act,” and by the acts amending the same, the Roman Catholic 
minority of Her Majesty’s subjects in Manitoba acquired the rights and privileges 
in relation to education thereby conferred upon them, including the right to build, 
maintain, equip, manage, conduct, and support Roman Catholic schools in a manner 
provided by the said statutes, the right to a proportionate share of any grant made 
out of the public funds for the purposes of education and the right of exemption of 
such members of the Roman Catholic Church as contribute to such Roman Catholi¢ 
schools from all payments or contributions to the support of any other schools. 
That subsequently, in the fifty-third year of Her Majesty’s reign, two statutes 
were passed by the legislature of the Province of Manitoba relating to education, 
which statutes came into force on the 1st day of May, 1890, and are entitled, respec- 
tively, ‘‘An act respecting the department of education” and ‘‘An act respecting 
public schools,” and that the effect of the two last-mentioned statutes was to repeal 
the previous acts of the Province of Manitoba in relation to education, and to 
deprive the Roman Catholic minority of the rights and privileges which it had 
acquired under such previous statutes, and by the said petition the said Roman

Catholic minority prayed, among other things, that it might be declared that the 
said last-mentioned acts did affect the rights and privileges of the said Roman 
Catholic minority of the Queen’s subjects in relation to education. 
That it might be declared that to his excellency the Governor-General in council it 
seems requisite that the provisions of the statutes in force in the Province of Mani- 
toba, prior to the passage of the said acts, should be reenacted in so far at least as 
may be necessary to secure to the Roman Catholics in the said Province the right to 
build, maintain, equip, manage, conduct, and support their schools in the manner 
provided for by the said statutes, to secure to them their proportionate share of any 
grant made out of the public funds for the purposes of education, and to relieve 
such members of the Roman Catholic Church as contribute to such Roman Catholic 
schools from all payment or contribution to the support of any other schools, or 
that the said acts of 1890 should be so modified or amended as to effect such 
purposes, 
And that such further or other declaration or order might be made as to his excel- 
lency the Governor-General in council should under the circumstances seem proper, 
and that such directions might be given, provisions made, and all things done in the 
premises for the purpose of affording relief to the said Roman Catholic minority in 
tho said Province, as to his excellency in council might seem meet. And 
Whereas the 26th day of February, 1895, having been appointed for the hearing 
of the said appeal, and the same coming on to be heard on that day, and on the 5th, 
6th, and 7th days of March, 1895, in the presence of counsel for the petitioners (the 
said Roman Catholic minority of Her Majesty’s subjects in the Province of Manitoba) 
and as well for the Province of Manitoba, upon reading the said petition and the 
statutes therein referred to, and upon hearing what was alleged by counsel on both 
sides, his excellency the Governor-General in council was pleased to order and 
adjudge, and it is hereby ordered and adjudged, that the said appeal be and the 
same is hereby allowed in so far as it relates to rights acquired by the said Roman 
Catholic minority under legislation of the Province of Manitoba, passed subsequent 
to the Union of that Province with the Dominion of Canada, and his excellency the 
Governor-General in council was pleased to adjudge and declare, and it is hereby 
adjudged and declared, that by the two acts passed by the legislature of the Prov- 
ince of Manitoba, on the Ist day of May, 1890, entitled respectively ‘“‘An act re- 
specting the department of education,” and “An act respecting public schools,” the 
rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic minority of the said Province in rela- 
tion to education prior to the 1st day of May, 1890, have been affected by depriving 
the Roman Catholic minority of the following rights and privileges, which previous 
to and until the 1st day of May, 1890, such minority had, viz: 
(a) The right to build, maintain, equip, manage, conduct, and support Roman 
Catholic schools in the manner provided for by the said statutes, which were repealed 
by the two acts of 1890 aforesaid. 
(b) The right to share proportionately in any grant made out of the public funds 
for the purposes of education. 
(ce) The right of exemption of such Roman Catholics as contribute to Roman 
Catholic schools from all payment or contribution to the support of any other schools. 
And his excellency the Governor-General in council was further pleased to declare 
and decide, and it is hereby declared, that it seems requisite that the system of 
education embodied in the two acts of 1890, aforesaid, shall be supplemented by a 
provincial act or acts which will restore to the Roman Catholic minority the said 
rights and privileges of which such minority has been deprived as aforesaid, and 
which will modify the said acts of 1890 so far, and so far only, as may be necessary 
to give effect to the provisions restoring the rights and privileges in paragraphs (a), 
(8), and (¢) hereinbefore mentioned. 
Whereof the lieutenant-goyernor of the Province of Manitoba for the time being, 
and the legislature of the said province, and all persons whom it may concern, are to 
take notice and govern themselves accordingly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The legislature of Manitoba met on the 14th of June, 1895, and after 
a full discussion of the remedial order the following reply to the 
Dominion Government was adopted on the 19th of June: 
The privileges which by the said order we are commanded to restore to our Roman 
Catholic citizens are substantially the same privileges which they enjoyed previously 
to the year 1890. Compliance with the terms of the order would restore Catholic 
separate schools with no more satisfactory guaranties for their efficiency than 
existed prior to the said date. 
The educational policy embodied in our present statutes was adopted after an 
examination of the results of the policy theretofore followed under which the 
separate Roman Catholic schools (now sought to be restored) had existed for a 
period of upward of nineteen years. The said schools were found to be inefficient. 
As conducted under the Roman Catholic section of the board of education they did 
not possess the attributes of efficient modern public schools. 
Their conduct, management, and regulation were defective; as a result of leaving 
a large section of the population with no better means of education than was thus 
supplied, many people grew up in a state of illiteracy. So far as we are aware there 
has never been an attempt made to defend these schools on their merits, and we do 
not know of any ground upon which the expenditure of public money in their 
support could be justified. 
We are therefore compelled to respectfully state to your excellency in council that 
we can not accept the responsibility of carrying into effect the terms of the remedial 
order. 
Objections upon principle may be taken to any modification of our educational 
statutes which would result in the establishment of one or more sets of separate 
schools. Apart, however, from the objections upon principle, there are serious 
objections from a practical educational standpoint. Some of these objections may 
be briefly indicated : 
We labor under great difficulties in maintaining an efficient system of primary 
education. The school taxes bear heavily upon our people. The large amount of 
land which is free from school taxes, and the great extent of country over which our 
small population is scattered, present obstacles to efficiency and progress. 
The reforms effected in 1890 have given a strong impetus to educational work, but 
the difficulties which are inherent in our circumstances have constantly to be met. 
It will be obvious that the establishment of a set of Roman Catholic schools, fol- 
lowed by a set of Anglican schools and possibly Mennonite, Icelandic, and other 
schools, would so impair our present system that any approach to even our present 
general standard of efficiency would be quite impossible. We contemplate the 
inauguration of such a state of affairs with very grave apprehension. We have no 
hesitation in saying that there can not be suggested any measure which to our minds 
~ would more seriously imperil the development of our Province. 
We believe that when the remedial order was made there was not then available 
to your excellency in council full and accurate information as to the working of our 
former system of schools. 
We also believe that there was lacking the means of forming a correct judgment 
as to the effect upon the Province of changes in the direction indicated in the order. 
Being impressed with this view, we respectfully admit that it is not yet too late to 
make a full and deliberate investigation of tho whole subject. Should such a course 
be adopted, we shall cheerfully assist in affording the most complete information 
available. An investigation of such a kind would furnish a substantial basis of 
fact upon which conclusions could be formed with a reasonable degree of certainty. 
It is urged most strongly that upon so important a matter, involving as it does 
the religious feelings and convictions of different classes of the people of Canada, 
and the educational interests of a Prevince which is expected to become one of the
-P-A-G-E-345
THE MANITOBA SCHOOL CASE. 287 
most important in the Dominion, no hasty action should be taken, but that, on the 
contrary the greatest care and deliberation should be exercised, and a full and thor. 
ough investigation made. 
While we do not think it proper to enter upon a legal argument in this memorial, 
we deem it our duty to briefly call attention to some of the legal and constitutional 
difficulties which surround the case. Is is held by some authorities that any action 
taken by the Parliament of Canada upon the subject will be irrevocable. While 
this opinion may or may not be held to be sound, it is, in our judgment, only neces- 
sary to point out that there are substantial grounds for entertaining such an opinion, 
in order to emphasize the necessity for acquiring 2 most ample knowledge of the 
facts before any suggestion of parliamentary action is made. 
It will be admitted that the two essentials of any effective and substantial resto- 
tation of Roman Catholic privileges are— 
(1) The right to levy taxes. 
(2) The right to participate in the legislative school grant. 
Without these privileges the separate schools can not be properly carried on, and 
without them, therefore, any professed restoration of privileges would be illusory. 
It may be held that the power to collect taxes for school purposes conferred upon 
school boards by our former educational statutes was conferred by virtue of the 
provisions of subsection 2 of section 92 of the British North America act and not 
by virtue of the provisions of section 22 of the Manitoba act. If this view be well 
founded, then that portion of the act of 1890 which abolished the said right to 
collect taxes is not subject to appeal to your excellency in council, and the remedial 
order and any subsequent legislative act of the Parliament of Canada (in so far as 
they may purport to restore the said right) will be ultra vires. 
As to the legislative grant, we hold that it is entirely within the control of the 
legislature of the Province, and that no partof the public funds of the Province 
could be made available for the support of separate schools without the voluntary 
action of the legislature. It would appear, therefore, that any action of the Parlia- 
ment of Canada looking to the restoration of Roman Catholic privileges must, to be 
of real and substantial benefit, be supplemented by the voluntary action of the 
provincial legislature. 
If this be the case, nothing could be more unfortunate, from the standpoint of the 
Roman Catholic people themselves, than any hasty or peremptory action on the part 
of the Parliament of Canada, because such action would probably produce strained 
relations and tend to prevent the possibility of restoring harmony. 
We respectfully suggest to your excellency in council that all of the above con- 
siderations call most strongly for full and careful deliberation, and for such a course 
of action as will avoid irritating complications. 
We deem it proper, also, to call attention to the fact that it is only a few months 
since the latest decision upon the subject was given by the judicial committee of the 
privy council. Previous to that time a majority of the members of the legislative 
assembly of Manitoba had expressly or impliedly given pledges to their constituents 
which they feel in honor bound loyally to fulfill. 
We understand that it has been lately suggested that private funds of the Roman 
Catholic Church and people had been invested in school buildings and land that are 
now appropriated for public-school purposes. No evidence of such fact has ever been 
laid before us, so far as we can ascertain, but we profess ourselves willing, if any 
such injustice can be established, to make full and fair compensation therefor. 
Owing to the differences of opinion among the members of the Gov- 
ernment of the Dominion of Canada as to what course was best to pur- 
sue, the House of Commons adjourned until the month of January, 
1896, with a view to take such action as may seem proper after having 
taken time fully to consider the question in all its bearings.
-P-A-G-E-346
    288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The following events, which have occurred since the foregoing 
account was written, bring the history of this case to date: 
On December 23, 1895, Premier Greenway announced that the people of Manitoba 
should have an opportunity at a general election to express their sentiments on the 
school issue. Accordingly, the provincial legislature on the 26th of December 
approved an answer to the Dominion Government definitely rejecting the Dominion’s 
request that Manitoba should enact a remedial law. The Manitoba legislature was 
thereupon dissolved, and the appeal was taken directly to the people. The election 
was held on the 15th of January, and it resulted in an overwhelming triumph for 
Mr. Greenway and his policy of nonsectarian schools. 
The Dominion Parliament assembled January 2, on which day Lord Aberdeen, as 
Governor-General, had presented his address to the lawmakers, and had strongly 
urged the necessity of compelling Manitoba to submit. It turned out that the 
Dominion cabinet was seriously divided on the subject, and on January 4 half of 
the ministers resigned their portfolios. For a few days it seemed probable that Sir 
Mackenzie Bowell would be unable to reorganize the cabinet and would have to 
resign his position as prime minister. Sir Charles Tupper, sr., was slated as Mr.; 
Bowell’s successor. Largely, however, through the efforts of Lord Aberdeen and of 
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, in his capacity as British colonial secretary, the cabinet 
breach was mended, the retiring ministers were induced to withdraw their resigna- 
tions, a place in the cabinet was found for Sir Charles Tupper, sr., and Sir Mackenzio 
Bowell remains at the helm. It is difficult to see what solution can be found for tho 
deadlock. ‘Review of Reviews, February 1896, p. 147.)

The system of education maintained by the French Republic preserves 
many of the administrative features of the Imperial University. The 
official head of the system is a cabinet officer, the minister of public 
instruction, fine arts, aud worship.? His authority is modified by the

advice of -professional experts, constituting the superior council of 
public instruction. A tendency toward decentralization is at present 
manifest throughout the system. 
Administration is facilitated by the subdivisions of the system. 
On the basis of scholastic grade it is divided into three great depart- 
ments—primary, which includes infant schools (ages, 2 to 6), primary 
schools (elementary and superior, ages 6 to 13), adult schools, and normal 
schools for primary teachers; secondary, to which belong the lycées (State 
classical colleges) and communal colleges; superior, which comprises 
special schools! and the faculties for liberal education and professional 
training, at present 59 in number. 
Bach of the three departments has its own chief or director,’ its sep- 
arate budget and distinct body of laws, decrees, etc. 
Local divisions result from the organization of the universities (fac- 
ulties), colleges, and schools comprised in the system into academic 
groups (17 in number) each under its own chief or rector. 
The enrollment in the several classes of institutions for the latest 
years reported were as follows: 1891-92, infant schools, 679,579; pri- 
mary schools, 5,556,470. Lycées and communal colleges for boys, public, 
85,291; sano. 89, "5665 for girls, public secondary, 11,605. University 
faculties (1893), aubie 2 23,397 students; private, 988. 
The obligatory expenses of the service are covered substantially by an 
annual appropriation from the State, amounting in 1893 to $33,699,943; 
of this amount 77.8 per cent was for primary instruction. The total 
expenditures for this department amounted in 1892 to $37,261,215. 
This includes, besides the obligatory expenses of the primary schools, 
i. e., $29,768,033, the optional expenditures, costs of local inspection, 
and the expenditure for departmental normal schools. 
The scholastic work of all public establishments is regulated by law 
or by official decrees that embody the matured opinions of the superior 
council of education, a representative body of 60 members, three-fourths 
of whom are elected by their peers from the various orders of public 
instruction, the remainder being appointed by the President. The 
council is not only an advisory, but also a judicial body, being the final 
court of appeal in certain cases of contention; as, for example, cases 
of the removal of teachers by local authorities. Paris is the seat of the 
council, whose deliberations are presided over by the minister. The 
academic rectors have the advice of academic councils composed of 
  
1 The special schools which are under the exclusive control of the minister of pub- 
lic instruction and fine arts are the Colltge de France, Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, 
Eeole Normale Supérieure, Ecole Francaise de Rome, Ecole Frangaise d’Athvnes, 
Ecole Nationale des Chartes, Ecole Spéciale des Langues Orientales Vivantes, Ecole 
Nationale et Spéciale des Beaux Arts & Paris, Conservatoire National de Musique et 
de Déclamation.

“inspecteurs d’académies,” professors, and teachers; finally, the pre- 
fects are assisted by departmental councils. These several councils 
save the work of public education, to some degree at least, from the 
mechanical routine which is one danger of a centralized system. 
All appointments to the service, whether official or professional, are 
made either by the minister or by the President of the Republic, except- 
ing only those of elementary teachers. They are appointed by the 
heads of departments (prefects, themselves appointed by the President). 
The officers of administration form an educational hierarchy whose suc- 
cessive stages are open only to candidates who pass examinations and 
secure the required diplomas or degrees. Promotions are generally the 
reward of distinguished service or the recognition of superior merit. 
Officials, professors, and teachers all receive their salaries from the 
State. 
Secondary and superior institutions have more immediate relation 
with the central administration than primary schools. 
RECENT MODIFICATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY 
INSTRUCTION. 
The most important recent measures affecting secondary institutions 
are the decrees of August 8, 1890, and of June 4, 1891 (discussed in full 
in the Commissioners’ report for 1890-91). The decree of August 8, an 
outcome of efforts begun in 1872 by Jules Simon, at that time minister 
of public instruction, reorganizes the classical course of the lycée. The 
trifurcation, which formerly took place after troisiéme, i. e., the sixth 
year of the lycée course, is abolished, and a single degree of bachelor is 
substituted for the three orders previously existing. All students must 
now pursue the same course to the end of rhetoric, or the eighth year, 
when the first examination for the bachelor’s degree takes place. In 
the remaining year (philosophy) options are allowed, and according to 
the choice then made he who successfully passes the final examination 
will have his diploma inscribed, “ Lettres, philosophie,” “Lettres, mathé- 
matiques,” or “Lettres, sciences physiques et naturelles.” The meas- 
ures which have thus simplified the plan of studies aimed also at 
readjustments which should give the natural sciences equal recognition 
with the classics. The failure of this effort shows the inherent tenacity 
of the traditional course. Latin and Greek, which declined slightly in 
1880 in favor of history, geography, and science, have since gained 
increased time. The efforts to relax the rigid uniformity of the lycée 
programmes and the mechanical routine of student life have been more 
successful. Opportunity is now given the principals (proviseurs) to 
develop individual characteristics in their respective lycées. 
The decree of June 4, 1891, relates to the nonclassical course of the 
lycées. Thename of this course is changed from “ enseignement secon- 
daire spécial” to “enseignement secondaire moderne.” In the read-

justment of the studies the technical or commercial character has given 
way to the educative. The claim is made that the course, “although 
modern is classic.” This claim is based upon the proposed method of 
treating the modern languages and literature, especially French. On 
the grammatical side the historical development of the language is to 
be considered, while the study of the several literatures is to be made 
wholly from authors of the highest order. 
The most original feature of the course is the expedient for placing 
minds on the historic plane. This is to be done by interpretations of 
the master works of antiquity, based upon translations. The interpre- 
tations are to be presented by professors thoroughly acquainted with 
the original, and able, if need be, to translate as they interpret. Thus, 
while modern languages and literature are the center of the programme, 
they will not be wholly detached from historic relations. 
Students who complete the course receive a diploma “ baccalauréat 
de l’enseignement secondaire moderne” upon the successful passing of 
two examinations at an interval of three months. ‘The second of these 
examinations is divided into three orders, between which the candidate 
may choose. According to the choice, his diploma is inscribed, ‘Lettres, 
philosophie,” ‘“ Lettres, sciences,” or “ Lettres, mathématiques.” 
RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACULTIES (UNIVERSITIES). 
The faculties are institutions of superior instruction corresponding 
to the universities of other countries. They comprise groups of pro- 
fessors, whose function it is to maintain courses of advanced instruction 
and to examine for and confer degrees. From their organization by 
Napoleon until a very recent date it was the latter service that gave 
dignity and importance to these bodies. The development of teaching 
functions and of autonomous powers are features of their later history. 
By a decree of 1885, authorizing them to receive, hold, and administer 
property, civic personality was conferred upon the faculties, and the 
work of organization was begun by the creation of a council-general 
of all the faculties (conseil général des facultés) of an academie district 
and a general assembly and a council of each individual faculty. The 
council-general consists of the deans of the faculties, together with 
two representatives from each faculty, chosen by their colleagues. It 
is presided over by the academic rector. This body regulates scholastic 
affairs of general interest to all the faculties represented therein, and 
has control of their finances. The general assembly of each faculty, 
which comprises all the members of the same, arranges the details of 
the courses of instruction. The council, which comprises only titular 
professors and “ professeurs adjoints,” receives gifts and legacies on 
behalf of the faculty and distributes its revenues. This council also 
has a voice in the choice of professors, appointments to the respective 
faculties being made by the President of the Republic from two lists, 
one submitted by the faculty council, the other by the superior council 
 
-P-A-G-E-351

of public instruction. The movement for reorganizing the facuities 
has culminated in a measure for transforming them into indepen- 
dent universities, a bill to that effect being now before the French 
Chambers. 
Meanwhile, efforts for the extension of the powers and scope of the 
several faculties are constantly in progress. The decrees of July 31, 
1893, pertaining to the medical course were discussed in the Commis- 
sioner’s preceding report. They require students to obtain a special 
certificate of physical, chemical, and natural sciences in addition to~ 
the bachelor’s degree before entering upon a medical course. Provi. 
sion for special scientific instruction leading to the certificate is to be 
made in the faculties of sciences, which thus derive new importance 
in the scheme of university work. 
The faculties of law have been the subject of revision during the 
present year. By a decree dated April 8, 1895, the doctorate of law 
was established in two forms, i. e., the doctorate of legal science and 
the doctorate of political and economic science. This is the successful 
termination of efforts reaching as far back as 1789 to secure state rec- 
ognition and support for studies that pertain essentially to the condi- 
tions of modern society. The decree also permits elective courses to a 
limited extent. The student of legal science, in preparing for his final 
examination, beside the required subjects in civil law, may make choice 
between criminal law, administrative law, and international public 
law. The student of political and economic science may, in like man- 
ner, choose between industrial legislation, rural legislation, and colonial 
legislation, or an equivalent course in history or economics given in 
another faculty. 
The standard of legal instruction, which has always been high, is in 
no wise lowered by the changes. Students must, as before, secure the 
bachelor’s diploma in the classical course before entering upon their 
legal studies. The legal course itself is arranged still for four years— ~ 
i.e, one for the baccalaureate, two for the licencié, and one for the 
doctorate. The actual duration of the studies is generally five years. 
Correlation of courses.—The courses of study for secondary and supe- 
rior institutions are elaborated in the superior council, due consideration 
being given to the opinions of the several faculties which are formally 
submitted by the academic rectors. These courses form a continuous 
scheme of study, starting at an elementary stage (i. e., for pupils 8 
years of age) and comprising the entire province of general and special 
knowledge. 
The ideal of unity which is typified in the administrative service of 
the system of education finds higher realization in the correlation of the 
courses of study. Students of liberal and professional education are 
‘drawn chiefly from the higher classes of society; nevertheless these 
courses have been brought within the reach of the common people 
since the lycées have been afliliated on one side (i. e., enseiguement
-P-A-G-E-352
294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
secondaire moderne) to the primary schools. This provision, moreover, 
has been made available by public scholarships open to competitive 
examination. 
The course of the lycées leads to the bachelor’s degree, which is the 
first of the series of university degrees, i. e., bachelor, licencié, and 
doctor. Candidates for degrees must be inscribed in the faculty cor- 
responding to the degree sought, pay the required fees, and sustain the 
examinations. Only those who take inscriptions, as it is called, are 
classed as students. In addition, large companies of hearers attend 
the lectures of the professors. Candidates for degrees may pursue 
their studies either under the faculties, in special schools, or under 
private tuition. 
The bachelor’s degree stamps one as a man of liberal culture; it is 
moreover, a necessary prerequisite to the higher degrees (licencié and 
doctor), which are the passports to professional and official careers. 
Higher education for women.—It should be noted that women are 
admitted to the privileges and honors of the higher courses. 
From 1875-76 to 1887-88, inclusive, university degrees to the number 
of 262 were granted to women. These included 39 in medicine, 130 in 
the sciences, 89 in classics and belles-lettres, 1 in pharmacy, and 3 in 
law. Of the whole number, 137 were obtained in Paris and the re- 
mainder in the provinces; 207 were conferred upon French women. 
Women pursue degree courses in the state faculties or under private 
auspices. They form also a large proportion of the auditors at the 
public lectures of the faculty professors and of the Collége de France. 
PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM OF PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
The series of official reports (statistiques) relating to primary educa- 
tion shows very clearly the development of the department since the 
passage of Guizot’s law of 1833, This early measure, to whose support 
Louis Philippe was won by the zeal of its author, has been the basis of 
all subsequent legislation on the subject. 
By placing upon the commune the obligation to maintain at least one 
public school and to provide for the free tuition of indigent children, 
the law assured the permanence and extension of the system. 
The dignity of the teaching profession was asserted by the clause of 
the law requiring from teachers guaranties both of their moral charac- 
‘ter and professional training (i. e., “brevet de capacité”) and by the 
provision of normal schools to be maintained at the expense of the 
departments, 
Upon these lines the system of public instruction has been extended 
by the Republic, while at the same time the central control has been 
greatly strengthened. 
The first measure of the present Government relative to primary 
instruction was the law of June 1, 1878, which placed about $24,000,000 
at the disposition of the minister of public instruction for the purpose 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 295 
of aiding the communes in erecting schoolhouses. One-half the sum 
formed a gratuitous subvention to the communes; the other half was 
to be used as a loan, payable in small annual installments, thirty-one 
years being allowed to meet the indebtedness. The policy was renewed 
by successive laws until 1885, when the gratuities were discontinued, 
but provision was still made for loans to needy communes upon terms 
precisely defined. 
From a special inquiry instituted before the law was framed it 
appeared that about 17,300 new buildings must be erected, about 3,000 
bought, and 13,000 enlarged or repaired if all the children of school 
age in the 36,000 communes were to be provided for. 
In the decade 1878 to 1888 11,632 school buildings were built or 
purchased, and at the present time school provision is substantially 
complete. 
In 1879 a law was passed requiring each department to maintain a 
normal school for women in addition to the school for men, provided 
under the law of 1833. This provision has been complied with by $5 
out of 90 departments. The law of June 16, 1881, obliging all teach- 
ers to secure a State diploma (titre de capacité), completed the meas- 
ures for insuring professional qualification in the teaching service. A 
second law, bearing the same date, June 16, 1881, abolished school fees 
and made instruction gratuitous. The year following, March 28, 1882, 
the law was passed making the schools secular and obliging parents to 
secure the instruction of their children. Finally, the law of October 
30, 1886, determined the classification of schools and the subjects of 
instruction, defined exactly the qualifications for teachers, confirmed 
the secular character of the schools by forbidding the employment of 
teachers belonging to a religious order, placed the schools under the 
inspection of (1) local officials—the communal mayor and committees 
and members of the departmental council delegated for the purpose— 
(2) under a graded series of Government officials—inspectors of pri- 
mary schools, the academic inspectors, and the inspectors-general. 
The delegates appointed by the departmental councils confer with 
the communal authorities and with the primary inspectors as to sites, 
buildings, material, etc, The mayors of communes have free access to 
the schools at all times; their duties and those of the delegates are 
much like those of our district-school committees, excepting that they 
have no control over teachers or programmes. It is incumbent also 
upon communes to maintain funds (caisses des écoles) for the assist- 
ance of indigent pupils. The law of March 28, 1882, obliges parents 
to secure the instruction of their children; they can, however, make 
choice of the means—either in public schools, private schools, or by 
home tuition.

SUBJECTS AND COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. 
* The subjects of instruction for primary schools, as fixed by the law 
of March 28, 1882, comprise moral and civic instruction, reading, writ- 
ing, the elements of arithmetic and the metric system; history and 
geography, especially of France; object lessons, and the first notions 
of science; elements of design, of singing, manual work (needlework 
in the schools for girls), gymnastic exercises, and in the schools for 
boys military drill. 
In the superior primary schools, which in 1891-92 were attended by 
45,599 pupils, these branches of instruction are reviewed and more 
fully developed. The course is extended to include algebra and geom- 
etry; natural science and physics, and their application to agriculture, 
to industrial arts, and to hygiene; political economy, French language 
and literature, general history, industrial and commercial geography, 
iron and wood work for boys, and cutting and fitting for girls. One 
foreign language is also included. Additional courses pertaining to 
local industries may be authorized by the minister upon the demand of 
local committees, supported by the academic inspector and approved 
by the departmental council. 
In the primary (departmental) normal schools the studies of the 
primary course are reviewed with reference to methods of instruction, 
and at the same time developed to include the full scope and scholastic 
bearing of those subjects. Pedagogy and school administration are 
treated both theoretically and practically. 
Instruction in the following subjects is given outside the regular class 
hours: In the normal schools for men, agriculture and manual work, 
inilitary and gymnastic exercises, vocal and instrumental music; in the 
normal schools for women, needlework, housework and gardening, gym- 
nastics, and vocal and instrumental music. The course of study in 
these schools covers three years. 
The progress of education is fostered by many auxiliary agencies, 
both public and private. The most important of the former as regards 
the interests.of primary education is the Musée Pédagogique. This 
includes a museum and a library for the collection of all material and 
publications which may aid the work or the researches of persons 
engaged in primary instruction. Here, also, classes and courses of 
lectures for teachers are maintained, and publications issued which 
make known the best methods of instruction, the best plans for the 
construction and equipment of schoolhouses, and the results of many 
valuable historical investigations.! 3

On account of the changes made in the financial system it is extremely 
difficult to carry a comparative statement of expenditure further back 
than 1887. The total expenditure in that year was 173,241,057.85 
franes ($33,435,524), and rose to 186,306,073.39 francs ($35,957,073) in 
1892, These amounts were derived as follows: In 1887, from the State, 
49 per cent; from the departments, 16.05; from the communes, 34.95 per 
cent; in 1892, from the State, 87.9; from the communes, 12.1 per cent. 
The great increase in the part of the expenditure borne by the State 
is due to the financial legislation of 1889 under which the State assumed 
the charge of the teachers’ salaries, and also of the ordinary expendi- 
ture for the departmental normal schools. 
The totals given above include the expenditure for normal schools, 
9,741,017.67 franes in 1887, and 9,284,241.72 franes in 1892, and also 
certain optional expenditures which fluctuate greatly from year to year. 
Tf these items be deducted, the ordinary expenditure for primary 
schools stands at 121,545,868.70 frances ($23,458,353) in 1887, and in 
1892 at 171,395,206.64 francs ($33,079,275). 
The former amount was equivalent to 3.18 franes (61 cents) per 
capita of the population, and to 24.48 franes ($4.82) per capita of pupils 
enrolled, the latter to 4.43 francs (85 cents) and 36.20 francs ($6.98), 
respectively. 
The foregoing statistics are confined to particulars which pertain to 
all systems. The additional tables that follow relate to features that 
are peculiar to the French system. 
Under the Republic only public schools derive their support from 
public funds, and they are, as we have seen, closed against clerical 
influences. The distribution of pupils in the several classes of schools, 
i.e., public and private, lay or secular and clerical, indicates, there- 
fore, to some extent the strength of the Government policy.

  SCHOOLS FOR ADULTS. 
The most important recent movement affecting popular education 
is that for the increase and improvement of schools and courses of 
instruction for adults. Schools or classes of this kind have been sus- 
tained in France by the church or by private effort for nearly two cen- 
turies. Their importance was recognized by Guizot, although they were 
not mentioned in his law for primary instruction (1833). From time to 
time State appropriations were granted for this work, and by the law 
of March 15, 1850, the creation of public adult courses was authorized 
at the option of the communes. At that date such courses had 
already been established in 6,913 communes and enrolled 117,000 stu- 
dents. The provision declined under the political disturbances of 1849 
and 1850, but during the second empire regained new vigor under the 
fostering care of M. Duruy. Through his efforts, while minister of 
public instruction, the law of April 10; 1867, was passed, assuring a 
State subvention to the classes for adults. Under this impulse the 
number of courses was raised to 28,586, with an enrollment of 800,000. 
The improvement was but temporary. During the early years of the 
present Republic the number of courses and of pupils in attendance 
declined and the State appropriations were correspondingly diminished. 
One of the principal causes of this retrogression appears to have been 
the want of a systematic organization of the classes; it was left to M. 
Gréard, the distinguished chief of the Paris Academy, to inaugurate a 
reform in this respect. 
In accordance with the principles laid down by M. Gréard, the pre- 
fect of the Seine issued an order in 1877 providing for the reorganiza- 
tion of adult courses in the capital. The courses of general instruc- 
tion were separated from technical courses for apprentices and were 
graded in three classes—elementary, intermediate, and superior. A 
diploma, or special certificate of primary studies, was created, open to 
pupils of at least 16 years of age. Finally an annual gratuity of 600 
franes was assured to the teacher in place of a grant calculated upon 
the average attendance at his class. 
The laws of 1882 relative to public instruction made no mention of 
adult schools. These laws, it has been observed, “reorganized but at
-P-A-G-E-357
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 299 
the same time decapitated public education.” They kept the children 
from the sixth through the twelfth year under a severe discipline, filled 
them with ideas upon all subjects of knowledge, but, the twelfth year 
accomplished, plunged them into life without any further purpose or 
end than the regiment for men and death for women. The evils of this 
freedom were foreseen by Jules Ferry, and his influence is traceable in 
the decrees of 1884, issued under the ministry of M. Fallitres. By these 
decrees every commune was authorized to establish a class for adults, 
the expenses to be borne half by the State and half by the commune. 
As a result of this effort 36,000 classes were opened within a year. 
The avowed purpose of the classes was to overcome illiteracy in youth 
above the legal school age, 13 years, and the subjects taught were the 
same as in the elementary schools, As time passed the compulsory 
Jaw with free schools brought all children into the schools, illiteracy 
was reduced to a minimum, and the original cause for the maintenance 
of adult courses was removed. In 1894 they had fallen to 7,090, or a 
decline of 80 per cent in a decade. Meanwhile it appeared that the 
proportion of conseripts, who, although not totally illiterate, had a mere 
smattering of letters, was constantly increasing, and that there was an 
alarming prevalence of crime among adolescent youths. <A well-known 
essayist, M. Bérenger, writes: 
This is the gravest social danger that menaces the secular state. 
Between 11 and 20 years, the age of developing puberty, when conscience is dis- 
turbed, when the character is forming, the youth of the common classes are socially 
abandoned. 
The clerical party have not been slow to take up the ery and accuse 
the state of having destroyed the moral safeguards which the church 
formerly threw around wayward and irresponsible youth. 
That the evils complained of are real does not scem to be questioned, 
and the Government is aroused to the necessity of continuing some form 
of guidance and control through the years of adolescence. The schools 
or classes for adults naturally offer the means for this prolonged 
guardianship, but it is not the school limited to elementary subjects 
and routine methods that can be relied upon to influence, restrain, and 
direct the energies of young men and women. These schools must 
be reorganized, made attractive, and of practical utility if they are to 
accomplish their new mission. The question is exactly the same that 
has recently been discussed in England with the result that the evening 
schools of that country have been completely transformed. Some such 
course must apparently be taken in France. The Government began 
the work by a special investigation committed in March last (1895) to 
M. Edouard Petit, a professor in one of the Paris lycées. He was 
instructed to make an exhaustive inquiry into all the conditions bear- 
ing upon the instruction of adults, and to report to the minister in full 
the results of his investigation, The mission was ably fulfilled, and 
the report covers fully all questions of methods, programmes, instruc-
-P-A-G-E-358
300 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
tion, apparatus, finances, ete., that must be settled before the work of 
reorganization actually begins. ; 
M. Petit found it impossible to secure exact information as to the 
number of adult courses in actual existence. He estimates it at ten 
or twelve thousand, and finds everywhere that primary teachers are 
ready to undertake the work. In respect to programmes, peculiar diffi- 
culties arise from the passion of the people for unity, order, and exact 
rules, and their constant habit of depending upon these. To be effect- 
ive, it is necessary, as M. Petit observes, that these courses should be 
“infinitely varied.” He would advise, therefore, a “sort of general 
plan” which may serve as a guide to the instruction, but leave the 
details to be determined by time and circumstance. 
The methods of instruction must be varied, like the programmes; 
some subjects ought to be treated by courses of connected lessons 
which should last at least three months with three sessions a week, 
each occupying one and a half hours. Conferences—that is, exercises 
in which the students discuss the subject with the teachers—should be 
alittle longer. As to illustrated lectures, scientific demonstrations, 
etc., these must be left to the discretion of the managers. Heretofore, 
only elementary teachers have been engaged in the work of adult 
instruction. M. Petit would enlist, also, the professors of secondary 
and superior instruction, and even specialists who are outside of the 
university. Thus the adult courses would become a means of uniting 
the three orders of instruction. As to auxiliary aids in the work of 
instruction, M. Petit emphasizes the importance of public libraries 
and of apparatus, and particularly the use of the magic lantern (“pro- 
jections lumineuses”). “The magic lantern,” he says, “exercises an 
irresistible attraction in a village and even in acity. Itis a féte day 
in many communes when it is announced that the views obtained from 
Paris have arrived.” So great is the interest excited, that in a num- 
_ ber of communes subscriptions have readily been raised for the pur- 
chase of a lantern and views, and in several instances communes have 
clubbed together to secure the coveted apparatus. M. Petit advises 
a fixed remuneration for teachers engaged in the work, prizes for the 
students, and medals and academic palms for the most successful teach- 
ers. As to the sources of support, first and chief would be local con- 
tributions or appropriations; nevertheless, M. Petit recognizes clearly 
that the State must bear a part in the expense. For the first year he 
estimates that 250,000 francs ($50,000) from the public treasury would 
suffice; in four or five years the subvention should be doubled and even 
quadrupled. 
Such, in brief, are the measures proposed in the report which M. Petit 
has submitted. : 
While the future policy of the Government in respect to public 
courses for adults is not fully formulated, it is evident that the instruc- 
tion provided will pertain to subjects beyond the elements, and that
-P-A-G-E-359
_ EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 301 
every means will be employed to make it interesting and of practical 
utility to the students. Meanwhile private societies throughout the 
country are redoubling their efforts in the same direction. 
Particularly significant is the action taken by the Havre society for 
instruction by object teaching (“enseignement par Vaspect”). This 
society celebrated its fifteenth anniversary in May last by calling a 
congress of all the societies for promoting popular education, to meet 
at Havre in the following August for the consideration of this very 
subject. 
Above four hundred delegates responded to the call, and the assembly 
derived prestige from the presence of President Faure. M. Poincaré, 
minister of public instruction, M. Ferdinand Buisson, director of pri- 
mary instruction, and M. Gréard, rector of the Academy of Paris, took 
active part in the proceedings. 
The general question was resolved into four topics, each assigned to 
a distinct section of the congress: (1) Courses for adults; (2) popular 
lectures; (3) instruction by objects; (4) sources of support and patron- 
age; but, as observed by M. Compayré, beneath these four different 
forms ‘“‘was one and the same question:” ‘How can we continue 
and complete the work of instruction and education commenced by 
the primary school?” The discussions and the resolutions adopted 
by the congress followed substantially the lines of M. Petit’s report. 
The purposes of the adult courses were defined as follows: (1) Moral 
and civic education; (2) general instruction; (3) technical training. 
The importance of public libraries and the means of utilizing them 
for the benefit of the people were emphasized. The need of public 
funds for the work was recognized, but it was urged that private 
societies must be the main dependence. 
This congress is but one feature of what has become an active cam- 
paign in behalf of a work similar in its spirit and purposes to that 
carried on in this country by Chautauqua circles and university exten- 
sion. The press of France is largely enlisted in the matter. The 
Revue Bleue secured letters on the subject from some of the most 
prominent authors and leaders of public movements,’ among these 
M. René Goblet and M. Léon Bourgeois, former minister of public in- 
struction; Max Leclerc, the well-known essayist; M. Wagner, author of 
“La Jeunesse;” Henri Marion, philosopher and historian. The editor, 
M. Henry Bérenger, prefaces the series by a historical survey which 
dwells particularly upon the initiative already taken by private societies 
in this matter. 
What the Government has not as yet been able to do [he says] private societies 
have undertaken. When the “Ligue de l’Enseignement,” established at the end of 
the second Empire by Jean Macé, had realized its first ideal in establishing a law 
making instruction secular, obligatory, and gratuitous, its mission was not ended.

The society considered that after the child there is the youth, and from that moment 
turned its efforts toward the reorganization of the courses for adults. This power- 
ful league, distributed throughout France in numerous independent sections, intro- 
duced the magic lantern, which popularized the great events of history, the grand 
scenery of nature, and the attractive mysteries of the science of life. This particu- 
lar expedient (enseignement par l’aspect), of which the Society of Havre affords an 
excellent illustration, has been one of the most profitable pedagogical outcomes of 
the movement. 
About the same time certain powerful societies were organized in Paris to spread 
knowledge among the people. The Association Polytechnique, afterwards the Asso- 
ciation Philotechnique, organized practical evening courses in letters, science, and 
arts. These two associations, to-day very flourishing, have rendered, and still 
render, the greatest service to the Parisian people. Two other important societies, 
formed among boys scarcely out of the high schools—the Union de la Jeunesse 
Frangaise and the Union de la Jeunesse Républicaine—organized series of weekly 
conferences on literary, scientific, and moral subjects, and have thus contributed to 
the diffusion of intellectual life among the people. 
Tho Parisian youth, therefore, have been abundantly furnished with all facilities 
for instruction, if not for education. It has‘not been the same with adults in the 
country. Not only has no institution been founded for them, but the school laws 
remain a fiction in many communes. The political divisions in every village, the 
frequent struggle between the schoolmaster and the priest, have prevented collective 
effort. To this neglect of youth must be attributed the increase of alcoholism and 
the manifestation of an ignorant and vicious spirit. 
In 1891 an energetic young man, M. Guérin-Catelain, founded the Société Nationale 
des Conférences Populaires, embodying in this ideas that Lanthenas, Lakanal, and 
Condorcet had successfully carried in the conventions of May, 1792, and of July, 
1793. He proposed, with his volunteer collaborators, to spread gratuitously in all 
France civic and humane instruction by means of printed lectures or lessons, This 
system was very ingenious, A scheme for a moral, scientific, or literary lecture or 
conference, drawn up by a competent person, was published, at the expense of the 
society, by thousands of copies. A copy put in the hands of the schoolmaster serves 
him as the model of a lecture and the basis of remarks before an audience composed 
of the working or rustic people. The society has had great success. It comprises 
to-day more than 3,000 directors of conferences and reported 6,000 conferences or lec- 
tures on the physical sciences applicable to agriculture, history, and hygiene in the 
single winter of 1893-94. Fifty texts, written by MM. M. de Nansouty, J. Siegfried, 
Félix Hément, E. Legouvé, A. Theuriet, George Ville, J. Steeg, etc., have been read 
thousands of times in thousands of cities. This work, an entirely private initiative, 
is a fine example of social effort, and shows what seeds one single effort can sow ina 
country like ours. 
Some timo after, in April, 1894, the bureau of the “Ligue de Enseignement” 
called together at Paris a committee to organize and collect opinions on the question 
of the instruction of adults. The call of the committee was not in vain. In August, 
1894, the league held at Nantes an important congress, composed of publicists and 
professors. They outlined a plan for the reorganization of the courses for adults. 
M. Ferdinand Buisson, in the name of the minister of public instruction, and 
M. Léon Bourgeois, in the name of the “‘Ligue de l’Enseignement,” delivered two 
remarkable discourses on the gravity of the problem and the imperative obligation 
of the State and tho society to secure the cooperation of the people. In December, 
1894, the superior council of public instruction prepared and adopted a project of 
law for organizing the courses for adults in accordance with new demands. The 
legislature alone has shown indifference in the matter, inscribing in the budget of 
1895 the mere pittance of 20,000 francs for adults, in comparison with 120,000,000 
francs that they continue to spend for the primary schools. But the idea has 
advanced. The publicists authorized MM. Félix Petit, Max Leclerc, Beurdeley, etc.,
-P-A-G-E-361
EDUCATION IN FRANCE, 303 
to point out the defects in our system and explain the reforms accomplished abroad. 
From the Government also M. Edouard Petit, who, by his spirited writing, as well 
as his eloquent words, has made a veritable crusade in favor of the education of 
adults, received three months since a commission to undertake an exhaustive inquiry 
into the subject and to gather everywhere the views of the teachers and the people. 
The result of this inquiry has been drawn up in a report, which is now in the hands 
of the minister, and will be without doubt the beginning of a grand administrative 
reform. 
The following account of the purposes and proceedings of the Havre 
congress, by Mr. H. R. Bigelow, United States consul, received as this 
matter goes to press, fittingly concludes the review of this subject: 
SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE EDUCATIONAL CONGRESS, 
HAVRE, 1895. 
By H. R. BicELow, United States consul. 
FREE CONGRESS OF THE SOCIETIES FOR POPULAR EDUCATION AND INSTRUO- 
TION, HELD AT HAVRE, AUGUST 30 AND 31 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 1395. 
M. Poincaré, minister of public instruction, public worship, and the fine arts, 
honorary president, in the chair. 
On the 28th of March, 1882, a law was passed establishing gratuitous obligatory 
education over the whole of France for all children between the ages of 6 and 13, 
Notwithstanding this law, and notwithstanding the supervision of the special 
committees of each municipality, it has been proved by statistics that in 1893, out 
of about 300,000 conscripts of the year, 28,000 were utterly devoid of instruction. 
The large towns, indeed, helped by the philanthropic societies, continue to provide 
their inhabitants with several gratuitous classes for adults, but the case is different 
in the rural communes, where attendance at the elementary school has caused the 
disappearance of three-fourths of theso classes, formerly attended by tho illiterate, 
although there are still 2,000 free societies for popular education in our country. 
[TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.—The word ‘ cours,” so constantly employed in this report, 
answers to several English meanings, such as class, lecture, lesson, ete. The word 
“class” has been taken as the most general. ‘‘ Patronage,” also, comprises protec- 
tion societies, friendly societies, aid, help, etc., societies. The word ‘patronage’ 
has been retained as covering them all.] 
Public opinion was moved by such a state of affairs. In 1884 M. Jacoulet, an 
inspector-general of elementary education, drew attention to the enormous loss 
among young people of what they had acquired at the obligatory schools. The 
pedagogic press and some eminent professors of the university took up the question. 
A society of public instruction—the ‘‘ Ligue de ’Enseignment”—affirmed in 1894, at 
the congress of Nantes, that if the elementary school gives the child the minimum of 
elementary notions absolutely necessary for every civilized man, it will still be indis- 
pensable to give him more extensive information, adapted as far as possible to his 
profession. And finally, in last January, the expediency of organizing adult classes 
was brought before Parliament and discussed there. 
In France the province of the State is extensive. The public-instruction budget 
exceeds 160,000,000 francs. From this sum the ministry can not deduct more than 
100,000 francs for a reform that would require the help of the 100,000 school-teachers. 
With such slender resources, how could they be remunerated, eyen were the com- 
munes to be taxed for it? 
This state of affairs induced the Government to set on foot an inquiry as to the 
creation of classes, lectures, popular libraries, societies of patronage for those leaving 
school, and as to the most rapid and economical means of attaining its object.

    3804 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
It was at this point that the ‘‘ Havre Society for Instruction by the Aspect” (founded 
in 1881 to adapt a rational system of luminous projections to popular lectures) took 
the initiative of inviting the representatives of the French societies of instruction 
and education, the directors of libraries, the editors of pedagogic newspapers, to 
meet in a body at Havre, bringing their ideas and their experience to aid in the 
solution of this problem. At the same time the society asked the minister of public 
instruction to take the chair at this congress, not so much to direct it as to be him- 
self guided by the competence and the free discussions of the delegates. 
A considerable number of communications relating to the questions to be discussed 
were sent beforehand to the reporters charged with their methodical classification, 
and each adherent received the regulations, distributing the work among four sec- 
tions. Each section, having chosen its president and secretary, was to deliberate 
apart, after which the resolutions were to be voted by the majority in full assembly. 
PROGRAMME. 
  (1) Classes for adulis.—Organization; educational code; methods and processes; 
special classes for girls. 
(2) Popular lectures.—Industrial centers; rural centers; different systems of organ- 
ization; subjects, choice of lecturers. 
(3) Teaching by aspect (objects).—Luminous projections, various modes of appli- 
cation; apparatus; photographic views on glass; choice and classing; circulating 
collections. 
(4) School societies of patronage for boys and girls.—Games; lectures; savings; 
foresight; reciprocity. 
On the 30th of August, in the presence of 400 members of this congress, the min- 
ister of public instruction, who was accompanied by M. Gréard, vice-rector of the 
Academy of Paris; Captain de Lamothe, representing the President of the Republic; 
M. Buisson, director of elementary education, and many prefects and members of 
Parliament, opened the meeting with a remarkable speech, dwelling upon the desire 
of the Government to be enlightened by the free discussion of the members summoned. 
to express their views in a kind of national consultation. 
The day was devoted to the special and simultaneous work of each section; the 
motions adopted were printed during the night and given to each member at the 
opening of the next day’s meeting. 
On the 31st of August, in full assembly, all the groups agreed in rejecting every 
programme or official interference in the application of its motions. 
One of the most important discussions turned on a proposal to institute examina- 
tions to be passed by the conscript on his entering the regiment. The reporter 
urged the necessity of employing every means to attract pupils to the classes for 
adults, which are in danger of being but little attended if left optional. 
Among these means would be the prospect of having to pass an examination, and 
having the marks put down in the military certificate book. The opponents of the 
proposal feared to create a certain inequality among the soldiers, and observed that 
there are regimental schools everywhere. 
The motion was rejected. 
PRINCIPAL RESOLUTIONS VOTED. 
First section.—To encourage the formation of adult classes in localities where the 
town council is unfavorable, 
To make the necessary steps easier for the schoolmaster or mistress by simply 
requiring them to advise the competent authorities of their intention. 
To obtain the help of the Government in the foundation of free societies for edu- 
cation by the simplification of the legal formalities. 
State grants to the societies for popular education that aid in the formation of 
similar societies in the departments by sending them delegates, lecturers, etc.
-P-A-G-E-363
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 805 
Entire freedom in the selection of programmes, according to local needs, left to 
tho directors of classes. 
Threefold object of the classes: (1) Moral education. (2) General instruction. 
(3) Professional education. 
Forms of the classes: (1) Preparatory. (2) Finishing. (3) Designed for soldiers. 
(4) Designed for apprentices. (5) Technical and professional (living languages). 
(6) Superior. 
The organization of the classes left to the free societies. State grants by results. 
Second section.—Generalization of popular lectures. Members of the university 
encouraged by the university authorities to give lectures and to cooperate with the 
free societies. 
Third section.—As much as possible to employ luminous projections to bring edu- 
cational and professional knowledge within reach of every mind. To make an appeal 
to authors to draw up a collection of conversations to be sent to every commune in 
France, with a list of the views to be projected. To encourage the execution of 
views for projection, so as to facilitate the detailed study of history, geography, and 
natural history, should a collection of objects be wanting. Creation of artistic, 
scientific, industrial, and commercial rauseums. 
Fourth section.—Object of societies of patronage: Morally, intellectually, and 
physically to watch over and protect children and young people. ‘To appeal to the 
school funds and to the various institutions able to help in the development of socie- 
ties of patronage. To find situations for the young people and to watch over them. 
To develop a spirit of foresight and reciprocity. 
On the 1st of September, at the closing ceremony, the minister of public instruce- 
tion made another speech. He did justice to the spirit of solidarity animating the 
members of the congress (as well the State functionaries representing private socie- 
ties or committees, as the independent delegates) in the task they had undertaken 
individually with such genuine good will. 
The part of the public powers, added he, is carefully to study all enlightened 
manifestations; to show their solicitude for the individual action of associations 
and of private persons; to make grants to poor communes, and, by everywhere 
exciting every energy, to complete the work of national education without increasing 
the burden on taxpayers. 
MOVEMENT FOR THE ADMISSION OF AMERICAN STUDENTS TO THE 
UNIVERSITIES OF FRANCE. 
The movement for admitting American students as candidates for 
degrees at French universities is exciting great interest in both coun- 
tries. At the international congress on superior and secondary instruc- 
tion, held in connection with the Paris Exposition of 1889, the matter 
was discussed under the general subject of the international equiva- 
lence of degrees. Eminent leaders of modern France urged the impor- 
tance of a policy which should attract foreign students to the country 
by the prospect of merited honors. This course was urged from motives 
of patriotism as well as those of scholarly freedom. M. Lavisse voiced 
the prevailing sentiment when he said: 
Happy are the people who know how to attract to themselves the youth of other 
nations. * * * They are making friends for the future. No nation has greater 
need of such friends than France, none is more capable of securing them. Let us 
strive to attract young foreigners; let us call them to our midst and receive them 
cordially. They will see with their own eyes how this country, so often calumpiated, 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
lives, thinks, and works. They will readily discover that it does not live and think 
and work for self alone. We shall serve France in thus making her known, for it is 
impossible to know without loving her. 
Utterances like these were intermingled with practical suggestions 
for accomplishing the desired purpose. The most important of these 
was the proposal to encourage students to pass two or three semesters 
at one of the universities by establishing standards of equivalence in 
accordance with which degrees secured in foreign establishments would 
Secure recognition in France. The necessity was recognized and the 
proposal supported, but there, apparently, the matter would have 
ended but for the efforts of an American enthusiast, Professor Furber, 
of Chicago. This gentleman has been anxious to see the French facul- 
ties open to American students on like liberal terms with those of Ger- 
many. In May last (1895) Professor Furber presented to the French 
minister of public instruction the following memorial on the subject: 
CONCERNING THE ATTENDANCE OF AMERICANS AT THE UNIVERSITIES OF FRANCE, 
{Memorial presented to the ministry of public instruction. ] 
With the advance of education in the United States the number of Americans 
attending European institutions of learning hasincreased. This migratory tendency 
on the part of those best prepared for the assimilation of knowledge and its dissem- 
ination in their native land has brought the nation closely into touch with the intel- 
lectual life of such countries as its students have been permitted to frequent. There 
is a growing desire to profit by the thought of other lands, and to overcome the 
erudities of a new civilization by a study of the old. 
Eminent in every branch of learning, in many unsurpassed, and offering exactly 
that refinement of culture of which the transatlantic world is most in need, it might 
be supposed that France would draw to her shores no small contingent of America’s 
academic pilgrims. Unfortunately, this expectation is not sustained by fact. At 
the Sorbonne there are hardly thirty Americans enrolled, as compared with some two 
hundred at present in attendance at the University of Berlin; while comparing the 
smaller institutions of France and Germany the disparity is even greater. 
To what is this to be ascribed? Unless it be assumed that France is intellectually 
inferior to Germany—an assumption that can hardly be maintained—the only possi- 
ble grounds for this phenomenon would seem to be, either that the Americans are 
unaware of the merits of French scholarship, or that some obstacle deprives them of 
free access to the schools of France. The former explanation is admissible only as 
acorollary to the latter. The real reason for the scarcity of American students in 
France and the successful rivalry of Germany in this particular may be found, per- 
haps, in the regulations which affect the foreign student in the universities of these 
respective countries. 
In Germany an American is allowed to matriculate and qualify for a degree on the 
basis of a certificate of graduation from some reputable college of the United States. 
In certain instances, though with questionable propriety, even this condition is dis- 
pensed with. Throughout his course he is at liberty, moreover, to elect the studies 
he may desire to pursue. The two functions of the university, that of providing 
facilities for education, and that of certifying to intellectual attainment by the 
granting of diplomas, are kept rigidly distinct; and the student is free from exam- 
ination, excepting when he chooses to apply fora degree. Prior to this juncture 
there is no effort made to test his progress—no disposition to question the nature or 
method of hiswork. Credentials certifying tothe proficiency of his early schooling, 
acertain minimum of time spent at the universities of Germany, and a severe test
-P-A-G-E-365
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 307 
of his abilities at the termination of his course are, in short, the only important for- 
malities to which a candidate for academic honors is required to submit. 
In France, on the contrary, the student is throughout his university career sub- 
jected to regulations which practically exclude the greater number of Americans. 
There is no established equivalent for the diploma of the French lycée with which 
to seek admission into certain faculties; the course of study is to a large extent pre- 
scribed; compulsory examinations are held at frequent intervals, and a surveillance 
is thus exercised over the study of the student that deprives him in no small degree 
of the character of a free investigator. 
It is obvious that, for the type of Americans found in Germany, it would hardly 
be profitable to submit to the strict régime imposed by France. The students from 
the United States are, with rare exceptions, men who have passed beyond the rudi- 
mentary grades of education, and have reached the stage of specialists. They are 
of intellectual maturity, graduates from native institutions, and are in quest not of 
discipline but knowledge. To such as these the privilege of independent research is 
indispensable, and they seek Germany instead of France. To be sure, it is possible 
for them to be inscribed as special students, and to secure as such the many educa- 
tional advantages that the latter country courteously offers; but this does not lead 
to a degree, a consideration which, though of trivial importance as compared with 
other fruits of study, is still sufficient to create a current toward the seats of learn- 
ing where a diploma can be incidentally secured. When it is remembered that many 
of the Americans in Europe intend in time to apply for professorships at home, it 
will be seen that this patent of successful effort while abroad is something more to 
them than a mere ornament. 
The course of action necessary on the part of France in order to secure the patron- 
age of the Americans may be suggested by what already has been said. It is the 
formalities alone that cause embarrassment. The American student does not desire 
that any essential requirement should be suspended. He does not request that the 
grade of scholarship necessary cither to matriculation or to graduation be lowered 
in his favor. He would only ask that the peculiarity of his purpose and position be 
taken into due account; and that he be permitted to fulfill through some equivalent 
the requirements which in the nature of his case are otherwise next to prohibitive. 
The only really burdensome regulation is that relating to compulsory examinations, 
which, when frequent, not only tie the student more closely to set lines of study 
than is advantageous for the American but, on account of the strangeness of the 
language, during the early portion of his course are doubly arduous. An arrange- 
ment similar in principle to that which the French faculties of medicine have 
already adopted, whereby a foreigner, under certain circumstances, may take all his 
tests en bloc, would relieve him of every obstacle in this direction. This, and possi- 
bly a designation of the American colleges whose degrees would be accepted as an 
equivalent for the diploma of the French lycée, are the principal concessions the 
American student would desire. If it be thought that, other things being equal, he 
would thus be given an undue advantage over the native students in securing aca- 
demic distinctions, his examinations might be so increased in their severity as to 
remoye all possibility of any such unjust discrimination, The Americans would dis- 
cover nothing inimical to their interests in any degree of proficiency which the 
French universities might consider it proper to demand of them; nor would they 
regard as inordinate a regulation insisting upon a somewhat lengthy term of resi- 
dence in France. In this respect they would be satisfied if only they were permit- 
ted to utilize their period of study as they deem most profitable, and to prepare 
themselves for a final test of their abilities in the manner they find most convenient. 
The educational system of the French is based upon a theory—a theory which 
implies continual surveillance over the progress of the student; and in this it differs 
intentionally from that of Germany. That the methods which obtain in France 
have their own distinctive merits is not to be disputed. There is no desire to criti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
    308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
cise the organization of the French universities or to bring them into unfavorable 
comparison with those of other countries. It is safe to assume that the educational 
institutions of the nation are adjusted, as they should be, to its own peculiar needs, 
as are those of Germany to hers. The purpose here is simply to emphasize the fact 
that the American student is not offered by the French the same facilities he enjoys 
in certain other quarters; it being of course a question whether or not the interests 
of France are sufficiently at stake to warrant her in taking action to amend the 
present condition of affairs. 
That an American clienttle such as the French schools have it in their power to 
command is able to commend itself is evidenced by the distinguished consideration 
the students from the United States have won in Germany, while the degree in 
which America appreciates the hospitality accorded her is shown by the effort of 
her universities to encourage foreign travel and research. Her faculties contain an 
increasing per centum of scholars whose education has been received to some extent 
abroad; and in many institutions of the United States scholarships exist whose 
purpose it is to give the students fortunate enough to earn them the benefit of 
European study. 
Combining, as our Western civilization does, two great elements, the Latin and 
Germanic, it is for the interest of America to study both, and in the opinion of many 
able thinkers the time has come when the former element, and this as best exempli- 
fied in France, is the one to which her students should especially address themselves, 
Tt is, therefore, not to an indifferent public that France is invited to extend her 
courtesies. 
On the other hand, there are considerations besides those of simple magnanimity 
that may be of moment in determining the course the French universities may 
choose to take. The young savants who visit Germany in growing numbers are 
already influencing American opinion, Berlin, with which Paris easily might vie 
for honors, is beginning to be regarded as the scientific Mecca of the world; and 
despite the favor in which French culture stands with many, there are in certain 
cireles in America indications of little less than a German cult—an enthusiasm for 
German thought and views that unconsciously unites with the high esteem in which 
the learning of Germany is justly held a partisan interest in her political aims and 
aspirations. It is from causes such as these that national friendships and animosi- 
ties frequently arise. The men who flock to the universities of Europe are the ones 
who will mold the ideas of the rising generation; and the sympathies of the nation 
will surely follow in the footsteps of her students. It is accordingly not the inter- 
ests of a few individuals alone that are involved. The intellectual life of the whole 
United States, together with her sympathies for France, can not fail to be affected in 
some measure by the attitude the French assume in regard to the question here 
submitted. 
A meeting was subsequently called at the Sorbonne (June 26) to 
consider the subject. M. Gréard, rector of the Academy of Paris, 
presided and leading professors took part in the proceedings. 
The interest which these measures excited was greatly stimulated 
by an article from M. Michael Bréal, which appeared in the Journal 
des Débats of June 7. In this article, which was republished in a 
pamphlet issued by the university committee, Professor Bréal con- 
trasts policy of Germany and France in respect to foreign students. 
He says: 
In Germany nothing is easier than to be accepted and treated as a student. Pro- 
vided you bring a certificate from some good institution for secondary education, that 
suffices; you are enrolled and take the academic oath. The rector bids you welcome. 
henceforth you are admitted to the courses and find yourself on exactly the same
-P-A-G-E-367
  ‘EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 309 
footing as the native student; you are a regular pupil of the Albertina or of the 
Georgia Augusta. You frequent the laboratories and, if an able man, take part in 
the exercises of the seminar—always paying, be it said, the requisite number of gold 
Fredericks each half year. No examinations for passing to a higher grade, no test 
of progress casts a shade over the tranquillity of these happy years. You have time 
to become familiar with the language of the country and with the spirit of the 
university, to form friendships and acquaintances, and to steep yourself in the 
atmosphere of your surroundings. 
But this is not all. The student who has spent two or three years in a foreign 
country naturally wishes to bear away some reward for his effort, some authentic 
proof that his time has been worthily employed. The German doctorate is admir- 
ably adapted to this purpose. You write a thesis of moderate length and average 
difficulty on some subject of your choice. After a series of interrogations in which 
the good nature of the judges tempers, if need be, their just severity, you are pro- 
claimed doctor; and you take back to your own country a diploma graced by names 
venerated and renowned throughout the scientific world. It is true that this 
diploma gives no assurance of obtaining a position. It confers no prerogatives 
either in Germany or elsewhere; but as this is understood beforehand, and as the 
conditions are the same for Germans also, there is no cause for surprise or for 
complaint. 
It is to this adaptable and supple organization that Mr. Harry Furber traces the 
preference distinctly accorded to the universities of our neighbors. We are far 
from believing it to be the only cause; but since it has been pointed out by a wit- 
ness so well placed for forming an opinion, we can not help thinking that it should 
be regarded with attention. We have to ask ourselves whether, by certain require- 
ments not wholly reasonable, we are not turning from us a clientéle which would 
ask nothing better than to take the road to France; but which, if we persist in our 
present course, will push forward more and more in the direction toward which 
it is now tending. 
There are difficulties which result from our educational system. We know these 
difficulties are great, but they ought not to be insurmountable. There has been 
created, within the last few years, a certificat d’études for foreigners; this is some- 
thing; but we are still far from the advantages, the seductive advances of the 
German organization, especially if we take into account the very sensitive amour 
propre of youth. What Mr. Harry Furber asks is, that foreigners should have the 
right to undergo the same examinations as French students, but that they should 
undergo them all together, or en bloc, at the end of their studies, provided they 
prove that they have spent a sufficient time at our universities. It is for our 
authorities to see whether this desire exceeds the amount of elasticity possessed by 
our regulations. If we are not mistaken, something of this kind has already been 
done for medicine. 
Professor Bréal also notes that present conditions in France are 
more favorable to the new project than those that existed in the last 
decade. He says: 
Twelve or fifteen years ago, with our system of centralization, it would have 
given rise to some embarrassment to bring together upon the same spot, Paris, any 
large number of foreigners whose presence would have resulted in overcrowding, 
with all the annoyances and inconveniences that follow inits train. But this danger 
is no longer to be feared, since we could say to the friends from without: ‘‘Our uni- 
versities are open to you; we invite you to frequent them and to sit by the side of 
our own children. But we counsel you in your own interest not to crowd yourselves 
into a city already overflowing, on to benches already overfilled. Would you know 
French life intimately and in its purity? Then choose one of our provincial univer- 
sities; continue in the provinces the investigations Mr. Harry Furber has so happily
-P-A-G-E-368
  310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
begun in Paris. Nowhere will you find scientific institutions that are larger or more 
convenient than those of Lyons, nowhere equipments more extensive than those at 
Lille (they have just been inaugurated). In the provinces you will run no risk of 
being isolated. The companionships formed so easily in youth, and among us more 
easily than elsewhere, will not be long in becoming frank and cordial. Would you 
revel in a rare climate, a rich and unfroward nature? Go to Dijon, to Toulouse, to 
Bordeaux, or to Montpellier. For my own part, were I to begin my life again, I 
would not be a student elsewhere than at Grenoble, within sight of the Alps, beside 
the swift waters of the Isére. And you will find everywhere the French—French 
language, the French literature, French ties. Have no fear that you will be impris- 
oned in a corner; there are associations that will undertake to transport you from 
féte to féte, from south to north, from east to west. Keep Paris, if you like, for the 
end, when, having completed your studies, you want to become acquainted with the 
furnace in which all these diversities are united and smelted down.” 
As a result of these initiatory efforts a committee of university men 
and officials was formed under the name of the committee Franco- 
American,! to promote the purposes expressed in Professor Furber’s 
Memorial. An American committee, advisory to the first, has also been 
formed in the United States, under the presidency of Prof. Simon 
Newcomb. 
At a meeting of the latter committee held at the Columbian Univer- 
sity, Washington, November 13, 1895, the following resolutions were 
formulated : 
1. This committee has heard with great pleasure of the movement of eminent edu: 
cators of France, having for its object the admittance of American students as stu: 
dents and candidates for degrees at the French universities. This committee heartily 
reciprocates the desire for yet closer bonds of intellectual sympathy between France 
1The members are as follows: Berthelot, of the Institute; Bertillon, director of 
the burean of municipal statistics; Bonet-Maury, professor of the faculty of Protes-

and the United States, which is implied by the organization of the Franco-American 
Committee of Paris, and by the interest with which it has proceeded to carry out its 
object. It would welcome the opening of the doors of the French universities to 
American students, as widely as those of Germany and the United States are now 
open to those of other countries, and believes that the friendly feeling implied by 
such action on the part of the French nation would be heartily appreciated by the 
American people. 
2. As the decision where cach American student shall pursue advanced studies, 
whether he shall avail himself of the rapidly increasing facilities for such instruction 
in his own country, or shall choose those afforded by the universities of France or 
Germany, rests entirely with the student himself; as, also, the reasons why American 
students flock to Germany rather than to France are too numerous and too delicate 
to be concisely formulated ; this committee is unable to state authoritatively whether 
any suggested measure would or would not result in a large attendance of American 
students on I'rench instruction. It believes, however, that the following two meas- 
ures are those which would best promote the proposed object and would tend to 
encourage American students to avail themselves of the precious advantages offered 
by the well-organized system of university instruction now enjoyed by France: 
(a) The acceptance by the French universities, as candidates for the doctor’s 
degree, of Americans holding the bachelor’s degree from any institution of learning 
of good standing in the United States; this degree being accepted as equivalent of 
that of the French lycées. 
(b) Owing to the disadvantage under which the student would labor, especially 
in the early part of his course, on account of his lack of familiarity with the French 
language, it is suggested that instead of the frequent rigorous examinations required 
by the French system, informal ones should be substituted, the successful passage 
of which should not be obligatory. 
The object of the examination would be the information both of the professor and 
the student as to the progress the latter was making, and the indication of measures 
necessary to make good any deficiencies in that progress. The committee believes 
that this policy would be better than the entire abandonment of current examina- 
tions, and would not involve any curtailment of the final examinations for the degree. 
3. The committee does not believe that the institution of any system of special 
degrees or special conditions for foreign students would tend to attract Americans. 
The latter, if candidates for a degree at all, would expect and desire to fulfill all 
requirements exacted by the French regulations of native students, and, having ful- 
filled these requirements, would expect the same degrees. 
4, After due consideration, the committee finds itself unable to supply a list of 
approved American institutions whose degrees should be accepted in France. It 
does not believe that any untoward event would follow from the acceptance of the 
baccalaureate of any American institution. Only the best students would under any 
circumstances seek the advantage of completing their education in France, and these 
might sometimes come from institutions little known outside their own neighborhood. 
5. Without being authorized to speak for anyone but themselves, the committee 
feels sure that French students desirous of pursuing their studies in the United 
States, would be cordially welcome at any American institution of learning, and 
afforded all the opportunities and advantages enjoyed by native students. 
As this matter goes to press, information is received as to the first 
practical outcome of the efforts of the Franco-American Committee. 
Mr. Furber, writing from Paris, January 21, 1896, says— 
Friday last the conseil supérieure voted a decree reforming the “licence” (i.e. de- 
gree of licencié), in such a manner as will, I think, permit the French faculties of 
science to be as liberal in their regulations as are the German universities. 
The new features introduced by this decree are: (1) Wider choice in the selection
-P-A-G-E-370
  312 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of studies; (2) liberty to migrate from one university to another, and (3) the privi- 
lege of taking examinations successively or ‘“‘en bloc,” just as the student wishes, 
The student is expected to qualify for his licence in one of three groups of studies. 
Each faculty will determine its own groups. In Paris they will be as follows: 
I. Differential and integral calculus, pure mechanics, and one other mathematical 
branch, as for instance, astronomy. 
II. General physics, general chemistry, and one other branch of science, either 
mathematical, physical, or natural. 
III. Zoology, botany, and geology. : 
Our students will be admitted on the basis of their American diplomas. If an able 
man, and thoroughly prepared, a student will be able to discharge the work required 
for his licence” in one year, by carrying his three subjects simultaneously. He may, 
however, if he wishes, take them in successive years, traveling from one faculty to 
another, and following at the same time other courses. 
After having pursued a study for a year the student has the privilege of applying 
for examination; and if he stands his test, receives a certificat d’étude. Whenever 
he secures three such certificates covering studies in one group, he receives the 
diploma of licencié @s sciences, and the doctorate is then to be obtained upon the 
presentation of a satisfactory thesis. 
As you will observe, this is practically the German system, modified, so that the 
student may not only take his examinations whenever he is ready, but also receive 
independent credits for every portion of his work. The regulations I describe go 
into effect at the opening of the coming academic year. * * * 
The faculty of medicine already offers all the facilities I think we could desire, 
and the faculty of theology is about to make us valuable concessions. There will 
remain only letters and law to be arranged. And something may very possibly be 
done in these directions before many months elapse.

TopPIcaL OUTLINE.—Brief view of the system of education, with statistical summaries, 
current and comparative.—New school law of September 15, 1895. 
The report of the Commissioner for 1892-93? presented a detailed 
exposition of the educational system of Belgium, with statistics show- 
ing its progress. In brief, it may be said that the system is character- 
ized by the union of central and local agencies, the State, the provinces, 
and the communes. There is the form of centralization with a high 
degree of local independence. 
State appropriations are made for all grades of instruction, covering 
in 1892-93 about 38 per cent of the total cost of elementary schools, 65 
per cent of the cost of public secondary, and substantially the whole 
cost of the State universities. 
The curricula of public secondary schools and of the State univer- 
sities and the appointment of professors in the same emanate from the 
central authority. 
The Belgian State universities, like the French faculties, are not 
only teaching bodies, but constitute part of the machinery for the 
administration of superior instruction. 
The State maintains a measure of supervision over both secondary 
and elementary schools through the agency of inspectors, but the 
commune, the smallest civil district, is the unit of and the controlling 
power in the elementary school system. In every commune there must 
be at least one elementary school. This may be a communal school, 
supported entirely by public funds; an adopted school, a subsidized 
private school, or a private school fulfilling the conditions of adoption. 
The communal council appoints the teacher and arranges the pro- 
gramme for communal schools, subject only to the requirement of the 
school law as to the obligatory branches. 
The following statistical summary (p. 314) shows the status of the 
several classes of institutions at the latest date of report.

SCHOOL LAW OF 1895. 
Intense excitement was created in Belgium during the year by the 
new school law which was promulgated September 15. The principal 
change effected by the law relates to religious instruction. This is 
made a compulsory subject to be placed at the head of all primary 
school programmes, instruction in the same is confided to the clergy who 
must have free access to the schools, either to give or to supervise the 
religious lessons as they may decide. The requirement extends to nor- 
mal schools also. 
The law of 1884 made religion an optional subject, and since that 
date it has been introduced into nearly all the schools, only 153 out of 
a total of 5,778 having failed to include it in their programmes. The 
reaction against the secular system established by the Liberals in 1879 
has now reached the extreme point. The new law is opposed by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
316 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Liberals, and demonstrations were made against it in Brussels, Ant- 
werp, and other cities, while its passage was pending. 
Although the excitement has subsided since the measure became law, 
its opponents have not relaxed their efforts to create a public sentiment 
against the admission of clerical influences into the schools. 
The principal features of the law, the obligation to maintain schools, 
the required course of instruction, the provision as to free tuition and 
the control of religious instruction by the clergy are here given in full. 
The clauses bracketed are identical with those of the law of 1884.1 
[Every commune must have at least one communal school situated in an accessi- 
ble place.] 
[The commune may adopt one or more private schools. In this case the King, 
upon the advice of the ‘‘ permanent committee,”? may exempt the commune from 
the obligation to maintain a communal school. This dispensation can not be 
accorded if 20 heads of families having children of school age demand the creation 
or the maintenance of a school for the instruction of their children and the ‘perma- 
nent committee” concurs in this demand.] 
The adoption may be valid for ten years or more. It will cease at the expiration 
of this time in case of the death or retirement of the teacher in whose name the 
agreement was made. The agreement is always renewable when no limit is fixed to 
the agreement. The same can not be annulled during the current school year nor 
without a year’s notice. 
[In case of necessity two or more communes, upon authority from the King, may 
unite to found and maintain a school. (Art. 1.)] 
(Communal primary schools are directed by the communes. ] 
[The number of the schools and of the teachers is determined by the communal 
council, according to the needs of the locality.] In every case the decision of the 
communal council to suppress a public (communal) school or one or more teachers’ 
positions must be submitted to the consideration of the “permanent committee” 
and to the approbation of the King. The royal arrété authorizing the suppression 
must be published in the Moniteur. 
[The council also controls everything relating to the establishment and organiza- 
tion of infant schools (écoles gardiennes) and of the schools for adults. (Art. 2.)] 
[The children of poor parents receive gratuitous instruction.] The communes 
must see that all those who have the right to free tuition and who do not attend 
uninspected private schools are provided with instruction either in a communal or 
adopted school. 
The following are entitled to free tuition for their children: Those whose entire tax 
amounts to less than 10 francs ($2) in the communes having less than 5,000 inhabi- 
tants; less than 15 francs ($3) in communes having from 5,000 to 20,000 inhabitants ; 
less than 30 francs ($6) in the communes of more than 20,000. 
Every year the communal council must prepare a list of the children who have a 
right to free tuition under the conditions specified. The council determines the rate 
per capita which shall be allowed under this head to teachers of communal and of 
adopted schools. 
The list, as well as the rate of allowance, must be approved by the “permanent 
committee,” with a right of appeal to the King. 
The communes, as also the principals of schools adopted or which might be adopted, 
may accord gratuitous instruction to other children than those included in the cate-

the provincial council, chosen by that body.

  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 317 
gories specified above. The ‘‘permanent committee” in advice with the board of 
charities and of the communal council, and with the right of appeal to the King, 
must determine the part which the board of charities must bear in the expense for 
children who have a right to free tuition. The portion so assigned is included in 
the appropriation for the board and must be divided between the communal schools 
and the adopted schools, the private schools fulfilling the conditions of adoption 
in proportion to the number of children in regular attendance having the right to 
free tuition. (Art. 3.) 
Primary instruction comprises as obligatory branches instruction in religion and 
morals, reading, writing, elements of arithmetic, the legal system of weights and 
measures, the elements of the French language, of the Flemish or the German, accord- 
ing to local requirements, geography, history of Belgium, elements of drawing, 
singing, and gymnastics. Moreover, it comprises needlework for girls, and for boys 
in the rural districts notions of agriculture. 
Communes have the right to extend the programme as may be possible or desirable. 
In the primary schools to which the law is applicable the ministers of the several 
denominations shall be asked to give the instruction in religion and morals, or to 
cause it to be given under their supervision, either by the teacher, if he consents to 
do so, or by a person approved by the communal council. 
The first hour or the last half hour of the morning or of the afternoon session shall 
be given each day to this instruction. Children whose parents make the request in 
the following form may be exempt from the religious instruction: The undersigned, 
in pursuance of the right conferred upon him by article 4 of the law relating to 
primary instruction, requests that his child be exempt from attending the instruc- 
tion in religion and morals. (Art. 4.) 
The inspection of the instruction in religion and morals shall be exercised by 
persons delegated by the ‘chiefs of the confessions.” The delegates discharge their 
duties according to conditions specified in a royal arrété. 
The chiefs of the several confessions notify the minister of the interior and of 
public instruction of the appointment of their delegates, who, after sanctioning the 
same, transmits the necessary instructions to the provincial and communal officials, 
as well as to the inspectors of primary instruction. 
Every year, in the month of October, each of the “chiefs of religion” addresses to 
the minister of the interior and of public instruction a detailed report upon the 
manner in which the instruction in religion and morals is given in the schools con- 
trolled by the law. (Art. 5.) 
That the teacher is not relieved by this arrangement from the duty of 
caring for the morals of his pupils is indicated by the following, which 
was embodied in article 5 of the previous law: 
Teachers must show an equal solicitude for the education and instruction of the 
children under their charge. They are to neglect no opportunity to inspire in their 
pupils the sentiments of duty, love of country, respect for national institutions, and 
attachment to constitutional liberty. They must abstain from any attack upon the 
religious beliefs of the families whose children are intrusted to them. (Art. 6.) 
Outside of the articles cited, the only important modification in exist- 
ing conditions pertains to the application of the State appropriations, 
These are to be divided between communal adopted and private schools 
upon the same conditions. The law provides, as heretofore, that the 
expenses shall be borne by the communes, the provinces, and the State. 
The’ commune must take the initiative in establishing the school— 
communal or adopted—providing the building and equipments, and in
-P-A-G-E-376
318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
order to secure an appropriation, either from the State or the prov- 
ince— 
Must contribute a sum equal to the product of 4 centimes additional to the direct tax, 
and must execute the law respecting primary instruction in all particulars. 
The provinces must contribute for school purposes an amount not less than the 
product of 2 centimes additional to the direct tax. The funds at the disposal of the 
commune for primary instruction can not be used for another purpose. (Art. 7.) 
As to the state appropriations, it is expressly stated that, ‘beginning 
with 1896, a credit voted annually by the legislature for the ordinary 
service of primary instruction will be apportioned among the communal 
schools, the adopted schools, and the private schools not adopted, but 
fulfilling the legal conditions of adoption.!. The rules of apportionment 
will be the same for the three classes of schools. (Art. 8.) It should 
be added that all subsidized schools must make provision for a certain 
number of free pupils. 
The requirements for admission to the public-teaching service are the 
same as under the previous law— 
The communal schoolmasters are chosen from among those Belgians, either by 
birth or naturalization, who have gained the diploma of an elementary teacher after 
being trained in a public normal school, or who have passed an examination after 
having attended lectures during at least two years, or who have gained a diploma 
for secondary teaching (enseignement moyen) of the second degree. They can also 
be selected from among those persons who have successfully passed the teachers’ 
examination before a jury appointed by the Government. (Art. 9.) 
The right of appointing and suspending teachers and of revoking 
their appointments rests with the communal council, although appeal 
» to the “permanent deputation” (provincial committee), and finally to 
the King, is possible in each case. There is the same provision for dis- 
pensing with the services of public teachers as under the law of 1884. 
This is accomplished by placing them out of active service with a tem- 
porary arrangement for salary (en disponibilité), . 
In the matter of salary, the position of the communal teacher is 
slightly improved. As against a minimum annual salary of $200 for 
assistant teachers and $240 for principals under the previous law, the 
present law fixes the following classes and rates: 
  
Principals. Assistants. 
Men. | Women.| Men. | Women. 
  
Fifth class, communes of 1,500 inhabitants or less... $240 $240 $200 $200   
          ‘lass, communes of 1,501 to 10,000 inhabitants 280 260 220 220 
Third class, communes of 10,001 to 40,000 inhabitants. 320 280 240 220 
Second class, communes of 40,001 to 100,000 inhabitant 360 320 260 240 
First olass, communes of more than 100,000 inhabitants 480 440 280 240 
    
The teacher must also be provided with a residence or indemnity for 
the same ranging from $40 to $160. (Art.13.) *   
1The chief conditions of adoption are that the school be conducted in a suitable 
building, that at least one-half of the teachers hold diplomas or have passed a 
Government examination, and that the school be opened to state inspection. 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 319 
An increment of $20 is allowed for every four years of good service 
until the total increment amounts to $120.1 (Art. 15.) 
The provisions of the law as to the service of inspection are the 
saine as under the previous law, excepting that it is expressly declared 
that State inspection does not extend to instruction in religion and 
morals. The provisions as to normal schools are also unchanged, 
excepting that with regard to instruction in religion and morals. In 
this matter, as already stated, they are subject to the same rule as

1 Teachers have the right to a pension upon the same terms as members of other 
branches of the civil service. They may demand the pension at 55 years of age or 
be retired with pension at 60. The amount of the pension is calculated for each year 
of actual service at the rate of one fifty-fifth of the average salary received for the 
last five years in the service.

322 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
I.—THE NEW EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 
The recent movement among teachers in the United States toward 
the introduction of Herbart’s principles and practices of education has 
found many advocates and adherents, which fact again proves that the 
liberty of speech and discussion enjoyed in this country is conducive 
to progressive action. There are at present more adherents of Herbart 
in the United States than in Germany. History repeats itself in this. 
Froebel’s kindergartens are quite popular here, while in Germany they 
seem to make very little headway. It is interesting and instructive to 
note how one of the foremost Herbartians in Germany, Prof. W. Rein, 
in Jena, views the subject from a German standpoint. He published 
in the Deutsche Revue of September, 1895, an article on “The old and 
the new education,” which is here rendered in English garb: 
Man is the most interesting study of man, and should perhaps interest him exclu- 
sively. Everything else surrounding us is either an element in which we live or a 
tool which we apply. (Goethe.) 
Goethe’s words place us face to face with the problem of education, 
for if man is the most interesting study of man we must conclude that 
it is not the mature man but the growing man which above all claims 
otr attention and interest. Whenever we meet a perfected person- 
ality, the question unconsciously arises, What has made it so; how has 
it grown to be what it is? Our interest is directed to the time of his 
development, to the contemplation of the influences that determined 
the formation of his character from outside, and to the germs which 
predestined his growth from within. The great problem arises, How 
much of the development of man may be ascribed to necessity and 
how much to freedom, how much to nature and how much to art, how 
much to heredity and how much to acquisition through education? If 
we further consider that society consists of individuals, the problem 
becomes more comprehensive and difficult, for it becomes necessary 
to investigate the connection of the influences which have operated 
between the older and the younger generation in the course of centu- 
ries; the question will have to be met as to how far the force of educa- 
tion has been effectual in this process. Think of this effect as we 
may, one thing is beyond doubt, namely, that education is neither the 
result of blind necessity nor of unlimited arbitrariness, and that it 
exercises a definite influence upon the development of moral energies 
which saturate a whole series of generations. Why else would states- 
men, political party leaders, church dignitaries, and laymen of all 
kinds try to direct the educational principles and monopolize the edu- 
cational influence of the people? 
Indeed, the mature has often tried to prescribe the course of the 
growing generation, and to do it more or less consciously. Philoso- 
phers and educators have developed their plans, fully conscious of 
certain aims in view, hoping they may be realized in the growing
-P-A-G-E-381
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 323 
youth. Thus Plato expected the realization of his social ideals by 
seeing the growing generation rise step by step to higher planes; 
Rousseau intended a rejuvenation of society through improvement in 
education and instruction in conformity with Leibnitz’s dictum, “Si 
Yon reformait ’éducation, Yon reformerait le genre humain.” Fichte, 
who seized upon Pestalozzi’s ideas, confidently expected the renaissance 
of his nation by the aid of a new national education. Luther demanded 
that the reformation of the church begin with the children; and in 
Alsace the hope of patriots rests upon the rising generation. 
At present education is called for also as an ally of the state and the 
church, and it is public-school education which is meant. The state 
intends to lead school education as its ally into the field against 
destructive currents that are threatening to undermine its power; the 
church tries to reconquer by means of instruction in religion what it 
has lost among the people. All such efforts are in vain, for though the 
school may be expected to instill into the life of the young generation 
new thoughts that may serve as guiding lines when this generation 
has become adult, its influence will prove powerless if it is pressed into 
the service of existing institutions that oppose popular currents. 
It is always objectionable to call upon the school to aid ina fight, for 
the school is a domain of peace. Here the artist, and not the warrior, 
is to work. On its threshold the waves of contention and strife must 
break, for immature minds grow best in the atmosphere of peace, until 
they are strong enough to participate in the labors of the day as ethical 
and religious persons filled with the love of national culture. 
But at times in which strong movements make themselves felt in 
opposition to existing institutions and principles, the idea is always at 
hand of influencing the rising generation through school education so 
that they may become pillars of throne and altar. This thought lying 
so near, we need not wonder when those in authority in the govern- 
ment of state and church attempt to make their power play upon the 
rising generation and force them into certain directions of thought and 
development. Can this be done? we ask again. First, we may remind 
the reader of the fact that in human affairs a sharply defined tendency 
invariably creates an opposing tendency. I merely mention the politi- 
eal and religious radicalism of many elementary school-teachers, which 
is the inevitable fruit of a normal-school education tending to make 
meek and pious teachers. Persons may be forced to a certain degree, 
but ideas never. Into their depth no ruler’s decree will penetrate, not 
even that of the most energetic and powerful man. That is the tragic 
element in those endowed with power which may kill persons but can 
not vanquish ideas. Ideas are invariably stronger than generations of 
rulers. 
But should we let chaos rule in education by yielding to every new 
idea that may spring up? By no means. Education, of all things, 
should be kept free from partisanship in political and religious wrangles. 
It should firmly adhere to that which will abide, outlast the times, and
-P-A-G-E-382
324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
in the current of conflicting opinions will form the firm ground upon 
which we can keep a foothold. 
To be sure; but what is abiding? Is it that which the old education 
transmitted to us? To a certain extent, yes. When Goethe, in the 
pedagogical province of the “‘Wanderjahre,” declares veneration to be 
the fundamental principle of all education, we agree with him. For 
education aims at culture, and veneration for that which has been con- 
sidered venerable at all times and by entire generations is a charac- 
teristic of true culture. In promoting this culture education is kept 
free from frivolous mockery as well as from thoughtless routine. Per- 
meated with the feeling of having its roots in a soil that has been pre- 
pared by countless generations of men, it yet faces without prejudice 
the acquired treasures of art, and examines what of new possessions 
we have in state, church, and society deserving transmission to the 
next generation in order to enable it to continue the noble work of 
developing culture. 
In this becomes apparent the profound difference between the old 
and the new education. The former, in estimating the accomplishments 
of culture, restricted itself to the transmission of knowledge for its own 
sake; modern education moved this transmission into the focus of 
character building, which idea is at present the central fire with which 
all processes of education and instruction are illuminated. In this 
central fire all special purposes and tendencies melt—tendencies which 
would narrow education down to pitiable dimensions. The state can 
expect of its schools that they will educate good citizens, but it must 
not claim of them the training of partisans. Likewise, the church 
may demand that the pupils become believers in divinity, but it can not 
demand that they be prepared to enter a definite theological system; 
or, in other words, the schools must remain undenominational. 
Our educational institutions (in contradistinction to professional 
schools) can have but one aim in view: The formation of ethical char- 
acter—that is, to lay the foundation of the character as firmly as possi- 
ble. This chief object is void of all special purposes. We intend to 
educate neither people who are politically orthodox, nor strict church 
people; neither those who are practically inclined, egotistical men of 
the world, nor worshipers of idols, but simply human beings who are 
filled with ethical ideas, in which the abiding part of the development 
of humanity is crystallized, and which indicate the directions further 
development is to take. 
There is something curious in this. School education of the present 
day follows ideals, yet the result, as is often lamented, seems to be the 
opposite: A race void of ideals. In former times people were not 
conscious of this aim of character-building; the young were merely 
instructed, and the result was a generation devoted to ideals. Is this 
a law in the life of nations that, when a people begins to loosen its 
ethical tension, the demand for an education tending to develop ideals
-P-A-G-E-383
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 325 
appears stronger than where the soul of the people knows nothing of 
egotism and love of money and spontaneously aims at the highest from 
inner necessity? When we hear it said that in times of a nation’s 
degeneracy an ideal education is a powerful remedy against the evils of 
the time, we are tempted to believe in the truth of the law; but instantly 
the doubt arises whether education can accomplish much where the 
atmosphere of family and society is filled with pest germs, where an 
ever-open chasm exists between the idealistic flight of the school and 
the materialistic current of the home and the times. 
The old education evidently had an easier task. Its spirit was the 
spirit of society. The school could sin a great deal without injuring 
the pupil’s soul, for that soul could constantly be refreshed by the 
power emanating from the family, At present, when the family, during 
this terrible state of unrest through which our generation passes, is 
losing its strength and influence, it is to be replaced by the power exer- 
cised by school education. Modern education is conscious of this diffi- 
cult task and all its recommendations center in the thought of ethical 
training, to which even simple instruction is to become a servant. 
It is true many view this attempt with skepticism. Many, relying 
upon the law of necessary reaction, claim that two generations follow- 
ing one another are different in their inclinations and views. Accord- 
ing to this, the influence of the education of an older generation upon 
the younger would be essentially negative. The fact is pointed out that 
very talented scholars develop most frequently in opposition to their 
teachers. These gifted students commonly gain decisive influence over 
their contemporaries by being men of action, artists, and influential 
authors, similar to the historical changes on the great stage of human- 
ity which have taken place almost in opposition to education. Thus, 
for instance, the first Christians had a Jewish education, the Humanists 
_ had a scholastic education, the Church Reformers had a Catholic edu- 
cation. The same rule holds good in other manifestations of the human 
mind; for instance, inart. Hence itis often considered a useléss attempt 
to gain immediate influence over a whole nation by educating its youth 
in particular directions. 
We do not share this opinion. As it is impossible in any individual 
case to determine the boundary between the influence from without and 
the growth from within, so it will be difficult to determine what in the 
life of nations is transmitted from the adult generation to the younger 
and what the latter produces out of its own power. The mutual influ- 
ence is so intricate that it would need the art of a divine being to dis- 
entangle the finely interwoven texture and to follow down to their last 
roots the infinite variety of combinations between educative influence 
and inner growth. It is enough to know that both the old and the new 
education presuppose the possibility of culture or training. Why else 
should we trouble ourselves to build up a system of education and 
calculate upon certain results by correctly applying it? The idea of 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
plasticity always stood in the foreground of educational considerations, 
but perhaps modern education is somewhat more cautious in its expecta- 
tions. Helvetius thought that the pupil was entirely a product of influ- 
ences emanating from education. Fichte said: “If you wish to rule 
man, you must do more than merely address him; you must fashion him 
so that he wills nothing but what you wish him to will.” This is evi- 
dence of a noble enthusiasm for the cause of education, but it is not in 
harmony with the facts. On the other hand, modern education will be 
very careful not to go to the other extreme; that is, to see in the pupil 
only a product of heredity. If such a position were taken, all educa- 
tional influence would be precluded; it would be powerless against 
unchangeable conditions such as nature has dictated. 
Though the influence upon the growing generation can not be deter- 
mined with mathematical accuracy, yet the effect of education is pow- 
erful enough to reckon with it as a factor in the life of the individual 
as well as in the life of society. It is an historical force whose effects 
may seem neutralized at times by powerful influences, but they con- 
tinue to work below the surface. Luther, despite his revolutionary 
tendencies, remained a good Catholic. It is known that in later years 
the impressions of his early education made themselves very strongly 
felt. Bismarck also remained, despite the revolutions caused by him, a 
thoroughly conservative man. All great reformers, however strongly 
their ideas may resemble revelations, derive their ideas from times past, 
and their early impressions affect: their thoughts and actions contin- 
ually. Thus we see that education does not lose its effect upon a gen- 
eration which is the bearer of an historical innovation, and wherever 
it is a question of fixing certain thoughts abidingly in the life of the 
younger generation, the power of education will be instantly revealed. 
Hence it is plain why it is attempted to wrest this important factor 
in the life of nations from the hands of chance and weave it according 
to definite principles into a system supported by a unifying spirit which 
enables it-to combine and direct the various processes of education. The 
first to do this was the philosopher Johann Friedrich Herbart. With 
him begins modern education in Germany. It walks neither in the 
tracks of state education nor in the grooves of church education. It 
is conservative in so far as it penetrates with its roots deep into 
national and Christian soil and continues to spin the historical thread. 
It is reformatory in so far as it does not consider good that which 
exists because it exists, but tries to eliminate from education all the 
dead issues, everything that is laboriously dragged along as dead bal- 
last by the people. It is the science of ethics which furnishes the 
standard measure for the decision as to what is alive and what is dead; 
ethics is truly socialistic, because it attempts to comprehend the life of 
the individual solely from the standpoint of his living together with 
others. Whatever in the mind of mankind has gained an abiding 
ethical value and absolute authority is crystallized around definite
-P-A-G-E-385
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 327 
ethical ideas, the realization of which in the life of the individual us 
well as in society must be considered an unwavering aim of education. 
By deriving its objects from ethics modern education obtains an aim 
that is morally necessary, abidingly fixed, claiming recognition through 
the power of its internal excellence, an aim which will not change under 
the wavering opinions concerning good and evil, one which will not fol- 
low fashionable philosophy blindfold, but outlasts the times, because 
it comprehends that which constitutes the true value of man’s life and 
points to an ideal which in its sublimity rests upon itself, the ideal of 
virtue. 
The methods which are used to realize this ideal in the heart of our 
youth are derived in modern pedagogy from the laws of intellectual 
life; it applies the psychological method in order to gain a reliable, 
sure way to its end. The necessity of aim and method secures for 
education thorough freedom—that is, freedom from transient ideals of 
the time and ever-changing fashions. It places education upon its 
own basis in a much higher sense than ever before. 
Though the aim of education could not be surpassed since the teach- 
ing of the Nazarene, it has frequently been obscured, weakened, and ~ 
‘suppressed according to the manifold ecclesiastical and secular consid- 
erations that determined the leaders. Modern pedagogy has, above 
all, the task to clearly define the purity and inviolability of the core of 
ethical convictions, which core has outlasted centuries and determined 
the direction the development of the human race has taken. In this 
it is in the truest sense of the word conservative and will not bow to 
the urging of juvenile enthusiasts, or prattlers without conscience, who 
intend to dissolve everything ethical in the muddy current of changing 
opinions of the day. It is reformatory, however, in the search for 
necessary ways, means, and methods in education. In this it will be 
the more successful the more psychology follows the development of 
the juvenile mind, in order to shed light on the twisted paths of the 
mind’s growth. The unification of the whole is secured by the fact that 
the sublime ethical aim, the fundamental idea of educative thought, 
forms the center around which all educational influence moves upon 
the growing generation. The aim of education and instruction is 
plainly distinguishable, but the dependence of the latter upon the former 
is also clear, because the end in view of instruction is derived from 
the aim of education. From the final aim of education is derived the 
demand for “educative instruction” that does not put into the fore- 
ground the mere acquisition of much knowledge, but the awakening of 
a strong, many-sided interest. It alone is able to give true education, 
while the former may be compatible with complete barbarism and a cer- 
tain degree of idiocy. Our schools, which, with their apparatus of 
periodical examinations and inspections, etc., tend toward an accumu- 
lation of many disconnected fragments of knowledge, have been steered 
into the wrong direction, from which only “educative instruction” can
-P-A-G-E-386
  328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
saye them. In addition to this, it must be sharply emphasized that 
the ideal of education in modern pedagogy is not only an ideal of 
unfolding of the intellect, but also an ideal of unfolding the disposition 
(Gesinnung). The education of the will is the chief object; intellectual 
and mental training are merely its servants. Without doubt the will 
is the most important phenomenon in the domain of mental activity, 
the highest point of all internal processes, the bearer of the ethical 
value of the personality. This has become clear ever since Kant 
emphasized the will, and hence it has become more and more obvious 
to the educator in what direction his efforts should go. 
From a purer, more exact, and higher comprehension of the aim of 
education results a more correct gauging of the means of education. 
The Pestalozzian formula, “Number, form, and speech,” has lost its 
power; in its place the history of civilization has become the dominat- 
ing factor. With that a double gain was secured—the transmission of 
valuable contents of culture to the growing generation, and a firm con- 
struction and an inner connection between the growth of the individual 
and the growth of mankind. 
With this the foundation of personal individuality was laid, an indis- 
pensable condition of the development of volition in harmony with 
character, and now modern pedagogy could approach the problem of 
framing a course of study that could furnish the conditions of rational 
intellectual education. This problem could not well be considered until 
the aim of education had been clearly and precisely defined, and the 
educational force of history had been plainly recognized. 
Starting from the idea of apperception, modern pedagogy attempts 
to disclose the process of learning according to its true nature, and to 
follow by immediate application the principles thus formed. In this 
lies the great practical value of modern pedagogy in real educational 
work. 
Would that it were recognized by all engaged in the education of the 
people! It would then perform a noble mission in the development of 
the nation; for, owing to the prevailing evils, a mere increase in knowl- 
edge is powerless, yes, even injurious. Engrafting into the hearts of 
the people pure and beautiful sentiments alone can eliminate or replace 
that which is distorted and injurious and apt to disfigure the life of the 
nation at present. To that end modern pedagogy directs all its energy, 
it being wholly devoted to the ideal of a society saturated with ethical 
ideas; it attempts, as a means to that end, to reach the ideal of nobler 
human individuality. 
It is true, a system of education, however excellent, will not suffice, 
for to make it effective in the growing generation educators are needed 
who are convinced of the truth and grandeur of pedagogical science, 
and possess the artist’s skill in making effective what they intend to 
have effect. How often have the plans of prominent princes and states- 
men been shattered because the executive organs failed to fully com-
-P-A-G-E-387
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 329 
prehend the spirit and guiding ideas of the leaders, hence failed to 
realize them? The ancient contrast between plan and execution makes 
itself felt also in the field of education. In order to overcome it mod- 
ern pedagogy has turned to the problem of the best professional prepa- 
ration of educators and teachers, a question which the old generation 
viewed with supreme indifference. “ Only get knowledge, and the gift 
of imparting it to others will come by itself.” “Only have spirit and 
you will know how to awaken spirit.” These and similar sentiments 
were heard that arose either from boundless pride or criminal frivolity. 
However, the needs of the time make it imperative to call into exis- 
tence institutions which will promote the preparation of teachers. In 
establishing such institutions pedagogical considerations have not 
always been heeded. It was overlooked that the centers of intellect- 
ual culture, our universities, should by right also undertake the task 
of preparing the educators of the people who can not only comprehend 
the entire organization of our educational system, but also perform the 
detail work of education with artistic skill and devotion. <A false 
notion of the object of our universities and their duties seems to dim 
our eyes. In the United States the universities are much less preju- 
diced in this as well as in other respects. It will not take long for them 
to surpass us, as they are establishing pedagogical chairs that will 
consciously, and with well-directed efforts, influence the development 
of the entire educational system of the Union. : 
That is the point where we make a mistake. If, however, we notice 
the progress made in this respect by modern pedagogy in Germany 
over the views of former times, we may entertain the hope that the 
future will supply that for which the present lacks comprehension. 
With Lessing’s theses on the education of the human race, with 
Schiller’s letters on esthetic education, with Goethe’s great didactic 
romances, with Fichte’s orations to the German nation, with Herbart’s 
General Pedagogy, a new epoch in pedagogical science has been opened 
in which the present participates, not in the sense of lifeless erudition 
which rejoices in the accumulation of printed pages, but in the sense 
of a living force that permeates the life of the nation and makes its 
influence effective upon the education of the rising generation. 
  
Il.—IS GERMAN PEDAGOGY IN A STATE OF. DECOMPOSITION? 
The foregoing article on the New Education in Germany is put in 
bold relief by the following, written by Dr. Friedrich Dittes, the editor 
of The Pedagogium. Dr. Dittes is the author of Die Schule der 
Pedagogik, a great authority on elementary education in Germany 
and Austria, and it seems therefore proper to hear him in connection 
with the foregoing article. There is an element of personal regret 
in his words that may have its origin in the waning influence of 
Pestalozzian principles and practices which Dittes advocates, but much

of what he says is so eminently applicable to the conditions in this 
country that a translation of his article is more than justified. This is 
what he says: 
Is German pedagogy at present progressing or degenerating? Look- 
ing back upon a half century, during which I have spent my time and 
strength partly in the study of the science of education in all its parts, 
and its various historical stages of development, as well as in the study 
of its supplementary sciences, especially philosophy, while during the 
same period I have worked professionally in a number of positions 
with all the intensity possible, I can, alas, give no gratifying reply to 
the foregoing question. I never neglected to keep an eye upon cotem- 
porary currents and events, while occupying myself with the scientific 
foundations and the traditional acquisitions of my profession. For the 
last thirty years I have, moreover, been obliged by literary duties to 
pay conscientious and thorough attention to all new publications in this 
field, and even now I have to read a number of foreign and about forty 
German educational journals, and receive weekly a large number of 
new pamphlets and books which bear either directly on pedagogy or 
stand in some sort of relation to it. To look over all this mass of liter- 
ature I spend several hours a day. I mention this merely to show 
that I think I am sufficiently informed concerning the present status 
of our profession. Though in former years I had no reason to con- 
ceal my opinions, I scarcely need to give the assurance that now all 
considerations that might prevent me from giving utterance to my 
opinion have disappeared. I shall with customary candor do my duty. 
And now to the point. 
In another place I recently published the following remarks: 
With reference to pedagogy itself in its entire extent, as well as its supplementary 
sciences (this word is to be taken in the widest acceptation of the term), Ihave had 
no occasion to change my views, although up to the present day I have followed all the 
accomplishments and movements in this field with the greatest attention and have 
heard all the clamorous calls for reform. During the last few years various philo- 
sophic, natural-historic (especially Darwinistic), physiologic, pathologic, psychiatric, 
socialogic, political, and other doctrines have been put into play in order to open 
new roads for the science of education and instruction. Yet the upshot of it all has 
been nothing else than an announcement of a few well-established truths as new 
discoveries, and a number of tottering hypotheses, one-sided demands, and obvious 
nonsense, which all prove that their originators would do well to learn something 
first before they play the role of reformers. For their dogmatic criticism of the old 
pedagogy, as well as their projects of reform, prove distinctly that they are at best 
well-meaning amateurs, in most cases precocious smatterers, or bold ignoramuses. 
He who intends to sit in judgment over a science and give it direction must cer- 
  
1Jt is desirable to state that in presenting the views of Dr. Fr. Dittes it was 
impossible to eliminate the asperities of the author without doing violence to the 
opinion he represents. The uncompromising position he assumes is in itself a very 
strong argument and deserves 10 be retained, especially since the other side is so 
ably advocated in Professor Rein’s article preceding this. Dr. Dittes is by far the 
most authoritative educator in central Europe, and a statement of the present status 
of pedagogy in Germany from his pen deserves the most reverend consideration.

tainly be better informed than by a superficial or fragmentary inventory. And as 
far as pedagogy itself is concerned, this most universal of all sciences can not be 
derived and construed from the opinions and postulates of this or that specialist, 
or from picked-up and not even correctly understood fragments of any speculative 
system, lest one grope from one misleading attempt to another, and finally lose all 
secure basis. Indeed the bungling work of meddlers in the field of education has 
already given rise to the opinion that pedagogy is not a science at all, which opin- 
ion hits the nail on the, head where nothing is known of pedagogy, or where it is 
made the arena of subjective whims and wild riding of hobbies. 
With these words I have just introduced the fifth edition of my 
School of Pedagogy; hence it is easily understood why at the opening 
of a new volume of this monthly (The Pedagogium) I should desire 
to enlarge upon that text. In their critical garb my words express the 
decisive reason why, despite my weakened constitution and other con- 
siderations, I feel constrained to continue my work as editor, though I 
would willingly lay down my pen if I saw pedagogy in a healthy state 
of development. 
Thatis not the case. Externally, yes, it has grown beyond its former 
limits. There are at least a quarter of a million of persons of German 
nationality occupied in the profession of education and instruction, and 
among them there are thousands who do not only practice pedagogy, 
but have the earnest desire to reform and develop it, who, however, 
think their practice too insignificant for their talents and seek their 
life’s object in reform. Among them are many who, conscious of their 
epoch-making originality, entertain the idea that they could do with- 
out an earnest study of professional literature, and yet pronounce a 
decisive judgment concerning it. This judgment invariably reads: 
“All of the old pedagogy is worthless; it is merely a collection of 
vulgar opinions, groundless assertions, arbitrary regulations, trivial 
recipes of schoolmasters, etc. The founders and coryphees of the old 
school did not understand anything; they have been surpassed and 
pushed aside by the great progress of our age; they must be thrown into 
the rubbish chamber with all their worthless trash, so that the needs 
and demands of the present day can be heard and heeded.” Therefore 
we see springing up reform magazines, reform articles, reform pam- 
phiets, reform books, and noend of them. I may safely say more of them 
would see the light of the day if only the publishers could properly esti- 
mate the works offered for publication and could pay for them, or if 
publication at the cost of the author was not so expensive. These 
latter reasons combine to let so many hopeful authors leave their new 
roads unconstructed, or see their plans despised by an ungrateful pub- 
lie. I have often been obliged to deny my assistance as an accoucheur 
for these original geniuses, and have harvested ingratitude, although I 
can candidly say that this ingratitude is more pleasing to me than the 
consciousness of having aided in populating the pedagogical field with 
monsters. 
Outside of the circle of representatives of our professional science, 
also, there is at present a large number of workers and reformers who
-P-A-G-E-390
  332 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
chiefly act as amateurs, but, as a rule, have no smaller opinion of them- 
selves than the aforementioned class, and think that they tower above 
them in possession of science and brains. Among these we find some 
university professors and some who would like to be; for instance, phi- 
losophers who think they have discovered a new principle that is likely 
to aid the perplexed science of pedagogy as a guiding star; or medical 
men who work in school hygiene, neurological and clinical specialties, 
psychological investigations, ““‘psychophatic deficiences,” doctrines of 
heredity, ete. Furthermore, writers of fiction and other polite litera- 
ture, who partly utilize in belles-lettres what new and sensational ideas 
the aforementioned authors publish and partly draw upon their own 
accumulation of imagination and truth, and who write works of which 
they claim that no teacher should “Jeave them unread;” also journal- 
ists and other free lances who intend to point out the way to education 
from still other standpoints—political, social, economic, and Heaven 
knows what. 
In short, pedagogy has doubtless increased in horizon and extent; but 
what about its inner value, its fundamental basis, its harmonious struc- 
ture, its convincing power? Are these attempts at reform at present to 
be reviewed as progress or retrogression? Indeed what is this most 
modern of all modern pedagogies at the end of this nineteenth century? 
It is a Proteus assuming daily new forms, difficult to grasp, because he 
knows not himself what he wants. Only one thing is repeated again 
and again: ‘“Tverything old is worthless, something new must be pro- 
duced at any price.” Reasons seem to have no weight, either in reject- 
ing the old or in creating the new. Sense or nonsense is all the same, 
so long as it offers something different from what there was,:as it suits 
the character of Proteus. Ofcourse anybody can play that rédle, because 
without professional knowledge anybody can speak and, in a measure, 
may be justified from the standpoint of individual autocracy. 
A few examples may show the results of this kind of reformatory 
activity. We shall select mainly works which prove a partial familiar- 
ity with the subject and an independent conception, leaving out of con- 
sideration all that literature which shows after a brief examination that 
it is void of inspiration and deserves an ignominious death in the waste- 
basket. Let it be said emphatically that in rejecting erroneous projects 
of reform we do not wish to injure their author’s positions or their other 
literary works, since several of these gentlemen have furnished esti- 
mable productions. It must be understood that it is not our task to 
rescue traces of good work and place such work upon a sounder foun- 
dation, but to demonstrate the destructive tendency of feverish attempts 
at reform and progress. 
A few years ago a university professor made the remarkable discoy- 
ery that all the pedagogy of former days suffered from the fundamental 
error that it was purely individual pedagogy; that kind of education 
had lived to see its day; our time needed a new, that is to say, a social 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 338 
pedagogy. Immediately this great reform idea was elaborated and 
commented upon in various educational journals. At first I was very 
much astonished over the announcement of this discovery, since not 
one noteworthy educator was known to me who had regarded the child 
solely as an individual, and not also as a social being. It is generally 
understood that even Plato and Aristotle emphasized this point of 
view, and nearly all the classic writers upon pedagogical science have 
done due justice to it. Exceptions are Locke, Rousseau, and Herbart, 
who practiced “tutor pedagogy,” and considered and treated the pupil 
chiefly as an individual, without, however, ignoring on principle his 
social destiny. But the discovery had been made and was faithfully 
repeated. It was especially aimed at Pestalozzi, who was denounced 
as the antisocial educator of our era; hence that he was worthless. 
And that was said of him who, above all, had so warmly and emphatic- 
ally pleaded for the social importance of education! How was this 
riddle to be solved? WHasily enough, for it was merely a confusion of 
ideas on the part of his persecutors. These gentlemen did not under- 
stand by the term individuality that which is generally understood 
in pedagogy, but its very opposite, namely, the typical in man, the 
generic character of the human being. That Pestalozzi, together with 
Rousseau and Kant and others, had been sensible enough to admit that 
the child should be, above all, a human being, possibly a complete, 
entire man, developed in every direction of his inborn capacities, if in 
future he was to be an honored member of society—that Pestalozzi saw 
in general human culture the foundation and presupposition of all 
special professional education, is a thing which to-day is considered 
an old-fashioned folly, for it is thought now that the human being 
possesses value only in so far as he serves the state, the church, and 
society, or certain interests of a social class and profession, and he is 
to be drilled ad hoc as early as possible and restricted within a very 
small horizon of knowledge and duties. Nobody, it seems, is allowed 
to be a whole man; that is to say, a man who is something for himself; 
he is to be only a fragment, a stone in the wall, an available material, 
a useful tool, a member of the serving or ruling strata, a laborer, an 
officer, etc.; but not a man, for such a thing does not exist any longer; 
that is merely an abstract idea, a phrase, a cosmopolitan fraud. 
Another university professor has found “that Pestalozzi had arrived 
at no inconsiderable errors by his exclusively speculative presupposi- 
tion of a fundamental difference between the sensual nature of the ani- 
mal and the transcendental nature of the human being.” Well! Pes- 
talozzi and exclusively speculative presupposition—that is indeed a new 
eombination. Those familiar with Pestalozzi know nothing of it, and 
they would like to hear from the Professor what errors they were into 
which Pestalozzi by his exclusively speculative presupposition had 
fallen. Probably he had refused to do reverence to the fashionable 
“Monism,” like that other famous Swiss who refused to bow before the

  334 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
hat of the governor. But this professor himself announces as the fun- 
damental demand of his reform plan that we must recognize “ psycho- 
physical parallelism.” He ought to know from elementary mathematics 
that for any kind of parallelism there must be at least two lines or 
planes; nor can he deny that there can be no psycho-physical parallel- 
ism if there are not at least two kinds of phenomena as objects of the 
investigation, namely, the facts of external sense perception and the 
facts of self-consciousness. It is not a question of an exclusively 
speculative presupposition, but it is a plain question of facts. More. 
over, the aforementioned parallelism, as far as it is demonstrable, has 
long been recognized in popular view, as well as in science, sometimes 
even, as with Spinoza, in an exaggerated manner. The science of ped- 
agogy has always recognized and appreciated it and did not need a new 
revelation in this direction. The Professor furthermore informs us 
“that education must not begin with the formation of ideas, but with the 
correct selection of stimulants” from which would result “the correct 
sensations and representations in the memory.” This may be to hima 
new discovery. Educators knew it and practiced it and found it applied 
in the best manner in the work of Pestalozzi and all the most noted 
psychologists of whom the Professor does not even seem to know the 
names. We might do without his ideas of reform, for that which in 
them tastes of originality—his assertions concerning the processes going 
on within the skull—is something which he had better submit to the 
approbation of his special colleagues. Pedagogy has at present no use 
for it. 
A young doctor surprised us with the brief declaration that “ peda- 
gogy as a science is a conquest of our era;” and then he proves at 
length that there is nothing in this conquest of our era. This apparent 
contradiction arises from the fact that the doctor has in mind only the 
pedagogy of the so-called scientists, which, it must be admitted, is a 
conquest of our era, and a very puny thing at that. Formerly it had 
served our doctor as wet nurse, but now he turns away from it, because 
it is only “that which schoolmaster pride calls scientific pedagogy, 
and because it has fallen into discredit with the most noted representa- 
tives of science; that this was the cause of the fact that people did 
not any longer wish to hear anything of pedagogy as a science.” That 
is certainly correct, but that there is another and older pedagogy of 
scientific value seems to be unknown to the gentleman; naturally, for 
in his own school he had heard nothing of it, hence he argues: 
The present has no scientific pedagogy, neither had the past any, consequently 
it must be expected from the future, and it must first be created. For that purpose 
a combination of pedagogy with psychology is to be established, of course, with 
modern psychology. Others had thought of such a combination before, but useful 
books in this sense had been wanting almost entirely. 
Thus speaks the gentleman, of course, because in the inventory of 
his school he had not found anything suitable for his purpose. Hence 
a reform must be inaugurated, or, as he terms it, a new formation from
-P-A-G-E-393

the very foundation upward; that is to say, starting with the aim of 
education that must be decisive for the entire science, an aim that has 
not been correctly understood heretofore. Again, this aim must be 
modern—that is to say, the educator as well as the pupil must be guided 
by the view of the world, of his nation, and his cotemporaries with ref- 
erence to ethics, economies, and politics. Concerning the ultimate end 
of all human aspirations and actions, the relations existing between us 
and the universe, between us and the fundamental principle of the 
world, “everyone should have a completely rounded-off view, so that 
man should do everything in the service of the absolute, and consider 
himself the bearer of a higher idea and the executor of a divine will; 
yea, actually, at all times be a part of a world-immanent divinity wrest- 
ling and contending under many modifications.” This modern view 
could, of course, not be determined by any individual, but must be only 
a sum total of “scientifically examined and well sifted” results of 
investigation concerning which “speculative philosophy” alone should 
decide. It may be rejoined that in speculative philosophy there are 
just as pronounced contrasts as there are in the opinions of the great 
mass. This fact the doctor seems to have overlooked. However, for 
the actual world he proclaims the “variability of views”—again a gen- 
uinely modern idea; but in things metaphysical, absolute, transcen- 
dental, and incomprehensible everything is to be philosophically de- 
termined and fixed. For this purpose, I think, the authority of this 
doctor will not suffice, and humanity will have to wait until the end of 
its days before it will get a pedagogy, if it is to wait for the determi- 
nation of its aim. Analogous demands have never been put to any 
other science; indeed, there would be no science if it had heeded any 
such demands. 
Should this young doctor try his hand at it, others will comfort them- 
selves with the conviction that he will never succeed in producing any- 
thing of lasting value. Human reason does not suffice to solve all 
these problems that are now placed as traps at the gates of pedagogy. 
Every new attempt at overturning, by means of metaphysical dogmas, 
the iron-bound limits of our understanding will end in disaster. Tor 
what should we have to expect if once again, by means of some power, 
the mania would prevail that man could actually combine and identify 
himself with the origin and fundamental principle of the world, could 
consider himself as the executor of divine will; yea, a part of the Divin- 
ity? It would not be the first time, for it was done during the Middle 
Ages, and it has cost countless victims of torture and the stake. Itis 
true there are even to-day people who would revel in the most frightful 
fanaticism if they only had the power. But is:pedagogy called upon to 
serve these people? Doubtless the doctor has found in his former 
school enough of such fanatics; unfortunately his leaving it has not 
freed him of the poison it instilled in him. To adorn blind self-aggran- 
dizement with a nimbus of erudition is doubly dangerous in our days, 
in which upon every curbstone the gospel of modern superhumanity is 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  
  336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
chiming in with the battle cry of the soldiers of the cross of the Middle 
Ages. One may class this among the many excrescences of the jin du 
siecle. I for my part confess that I have not the genius to appreciate 
it, and that I am still standing on the narrow platform of Goethe, the 
man “so poor in spirit,” who “has been shoved aside,” who said, “With 
the gods no man should dare to measure himself.” I hold that man 
should not want to know more than he is able to know, and he should 
certainly not, with his foolish, impotent plans, consider himself the 
executor of the divine will. We should advise him whose natural sense 
does not tell him, if he has astrong mind to apply the art of an ancient 
pioneer of the German mode of thinking, a good, strong dose of Kant’s 
eritique. which, alas, does not any longer seem to be in favor among 
modern speculative thinkers. 
If thus far pedagogy “from above” is promised from the highest 
pinnacle of speculative philosophy, and a view is opened from the 
theology of revelation, we now turn to another reformer. This time 
not a professor nor a doctor, but a very fertile spirit, who is ready 
to present us with a pedagogy ‘from below,” as his inventive genius 
terms it. People acquainted with the catchword will know that we 
have to deal with an apostle of children’s psychology—child study. He 
is a genuine councilor of confusion, and it is not to be wondered at 
since he claims to belong to the “scientific pedagogues.” With the 
well-known scientific accuracy and love of truth, he claims for those 
engaged in child study the merit of having shaken the omnipotence of 
the Socratic or catechetic method. As is well known, Pestalozzi has 
done that in a more satisfactory manner. Then he proclaims a princi- 
ple, and a thoroughly scientific one it is, as he says, by asking: “How 
does man develop, and what must, therefore, be offered him?” And he 
simply refers to the probable foundation of Ziller’s theory of culture 
steps, while this educational theory had found its most renowned 
adherents in Comenius and Pestalozzi. To do justice to these masters, 
however, does not seem fitting for the presumptuous bungler, lest he 
would have to recognize in the theories of these masters something 
“thoroughly scientific.” With the same accuracy with which he 
sketches historic momenta, our pedagogue “from below” constructs 
the theoretical foundation of his project of reform. He speaks of 
“faculties” which the educator may train. His chief authority, how- 
ever, is Herbart, who recognizes no faculties, hence no training of fac- 
ulties. We see, then, that he frames a doctrine diametrically opposite, 
according to which everything is inborn. He is ready eum grano salis 
to assert “man is perfect when he arrives in this world.” This is 
to mean that the baby possesses the beginning of everything, and this 
is what the gentleman calls “thoroughly scientific.” Our pedagogue 
“from below” lays special value upon the views of children, for his 
watchword is, “I go to school to the child.” The ingenuous reflections 
concerning stories, such as the Seven Little Kids and The Bremen City
-P-A-G-E-395
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 337 
Musicians (see Grimm’s Fairy Stories), as he tells us, he has directly 
from the lips of his pupils, which proves that he has very good guides 
in his child-psychology, for these children know, also, that these stories 
are merely composed so “that they should have something to read,” and 
they tell him, also, ‘how these stories could be immensely improved.” 
Experienced people will of course doubt the fact that this wisdom of 
childhood is purely the result of the genius of aspiring youth, or 
whether it has not been the result of adult influence, whether it was 
not prompted. This is a doubt which has at least as much justification 
as our reformer’s doubt in the reliability of the material collected from 
the psychology of children by other people. In fixing the simple data 
from the development of the child’s soul, the greatest care and cireum- 
spection is necessary. How much more critically must one proceed, as 
our pedagogue “from below” does, to make the expressions of preco- 
cious children scientifically applicable! The fiction writer can form the 
types of his children as it pleases him; the educator must use the 
greatest moderation, and if he, like our reformer, would use fiction, he 
would have to distinguish carefully between poetry and truth, a fact to 
which the “ancient Goethe” called special attention by the title of one 
of his works. Otherwise it might happen that an educator would get 
the reply from a boy who has been made a literary source, that his 
father had just composed or rhymed together a sort of a story of his 
course of development. Now, think of being called upon to listen to 
the precocious remarks of juvenile philosophers with respect and 
approval! This is pedagogical folly. 
The renowned “scientific” pedagogy is sinking indeed lower and 
lower. It began with drilling unripe youths into bold, presumptuous 
prattlers, and now it intends to make the A B C pupils professors of 
teachers. It will not take long, and children will assume the pro- 
fessorial chair and the teachers exchange seats with them. That is 
the true “pedagogy of the future” imagined by our author who prattles 
of a pedagogy “from below” worthy of the science of our day. Truly 
modern is this, and perfectly in harmony with the spirit of the time, 
which is also working in politics and religion by allowing the unedu- 
cated majority in noisy mass meetings to reveal to its honored candi- 
dates how they shall legislate and act, while the candidates flatter the 
dear ‘voting cattle” with sweet words, or while the fanatical disciples 
of “fighting ecclesiastics” demonstrate in denominational congresses 
which is the true faith and the inalienable right of the church. All 
this is done so that the government and public authorities may hear 
the voice of the people and read in it the voice of God. This is similar 
to “modern” science, and, above all, to pedagogy “from below,” which 
is to be reformed by children and ignoramuses. 
Our author acts as though child psychology was entirely a terra 
incognita and had to be discovered from its first elements. He asks of 
his colleagues that they should, according to a plan agreed upon, note 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
    338 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
down what things interest children and whatever else they may observe, 
so that “from the aggregate may be deduced that which is typical;” 
or “everyone should publish independently what he has found.” 
Unfortunately many good, successful teachers withhold their valuable 
experiences; possibly they are those who do not think it practical to 
repeat ever-recurring trifles in unending variations, men who remember 
the classic words “Seek honest gain, don’t be a fool who tinkles with 
his bells.” Yet, this is better than the publication of speculative 
“experiences,” the authors of which claim to be the discoverers of 
typical stages in child psychology. Our reformer interests himself, for 
instance, in the question, “At what age do children begin to criticise 
fairy stories?” By which we suppose he means, begin to doubt them. 
He answers the.question, “According to my experience this takes place 
at the end of the eighth year of life.” Well, well, well! Why not in 
the middle of the seventh, or at the beginning of the tenth year of age? 
That depends entirely upon the individuality of the children and upon 
the special circumstances of their education; precisely as in one place 
the inventory of concepts of a 6-year old child is not necessarily the 
same as it is in another place, because the objects and phenomena in 
the horizon of the one child are different from those of the horizon of 
the other. He who intends to construct an inventory of typical con- 
cepts that holds good for all cases—in other words, he who will con- 
struct a child psychology according to a given pattern, simply proves 
that he does not understand anything of psychology at all. That which 
“in the development of the child’s soul, and in fact of the human race, 
is typical has been clearly and distinctly proven long ago, and every 
true psychology is at the same time a child psychology, because with- 
out knowledge of elementary development of the soul the comprehen- 
sion of a higher mental life is impossible. It is precisely in this as itis 
with the sciences of the organisms of external nature, which must not 
ignore the embryonic manifestations of life if they wish to understand 
the sum total of development. But for that purpose there is not nee- 
essary a special botany of nurseries, neither a special biology of chicks, 
nor a special psychology of calves. But our pedagogue “from below” 
does not know what he wants; he has not learned anything of noted 
promoters of child psychology, of whom one may enumerate more than 
a dozen; hence he comes to the conclusion that up to the present day 
we know nothing and that all is a chaos, in which statement, as far as 
he is concerned, he is perfectly correct. While thus declaring that his 
pedagogy “from below” is still in the far future, he guides his little 
ship back into the safe harbor of the Herbartians, who build “from 
above.” Weare inclined to wish that he would stay there and com- 
plete his inventory before he enters upon new adventures. That will 
save him much useless trouble and would secure well-earned stability 
to the pedagogy “from above.” That school begins in canonic manner

with a simple being, granting it five ideas, six kinds of interests, and 
speaks of the strength of ethical character, of government, discipline, 
and instruction, of apperception and concentration, of culture steps 
and formal steps, of analysis, synthesis, association, system, method, 
and other furniture that has been used with comfort and facility before. 
It is easy to continue this ad libitum et infinitum, till doomsday without 
any practical result whatever, yet such talk will create the satisfaction 
of being a “thoroughly scientific pedagogue,” and secure a numerous 
crowd of disciples, for the race of those who would like to become 
“seientific” in the most comfortable and cheap manner possible will 
not die out readily; nothing can be cheaper than the fee which admits 
to the chosen circle of the so-called scientific pedagogues. If, however, 
a profane Mephistopheles asks: ‘‘ What kind of stew are you making?” 
they may give the classic answer: “We are cooking three beggar- 
soups,” whereupon the comforting assurance may be given: “Then you 
will have many customers.” 
This stew is quite prickling to the taste, and now and then it induces 
habitual guests to an analysis of its ingredients; especially the noted 
“interest ” enjoys thorough investigation nowadays; and a German 
normal school principal has recently devoted a whole book to it. As 
an independent thinker and principal opponent of Herbart’s theory, 
he treats this fashionable article in his own inimitable manner; butit 
is difficult to see how the science of pedagogy can be enriched thereby. 
It is true one can crowd almost everything into a treatise the subject 
of which is a catchword. ‘The title “ Psychologic-pedagogic mono- 
graphies” is elastic enough to admit subjects like interest, concentra- 
tion, apperception, memory, imagination, will, ethical character, etc. 
They can be placed in the focus of psychology and pedagogy, and yet 
in ever-recurring repetition mean essentially the same things; but in 
so doing the authors often tear asunder the elements of science—that 
is, they place them out of their generic connection and confuse them, 
partly overlooking or undervaluing, partly violently stretching and 
adjusting them, as though they were to fit a Procrustean bed, all for 
the purpose of fitting them to a pattern. In this manner the entire 
science of pedagogy gets out of plumb, it loses its symmetry, and while 
some of its departments lie fallow, others exhibit luxuriant but sickly 
growth. One of these subjects is the frequently discussed interest, a 
dropsical, swollen oaf among the psychologic-pedagogic concepts. The 
older theory of education sufficiently considered that which is desig- 
nated by this term. German pedagogy did not need to wait till by 
means of a high-sounding technical term a new world should be opened. 
for the wonders of which the mother tongue had noname. And instead. 
of courting this suspicious bastard that at first bore the recommenda- 
tion of being opposed to all eudemonisms, yet identifying itself more 
and more with the most outspoken egotism of modern interest hunting, 
it would seem to be timely to speak a little more of duty and honor.

    340 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
It is actually nauseating to see our children listened to to find out 
their interests and to instill in them for the future nothing but interests. 
A smart reformer, also a German normal school principal, has moved a 
step forward. First, he proclaims the principle: “Our common schools 
must be institutions for training above all.” That we all knew long 
ago, and no one had taught it better than Pestalozzi, and the common 
school was an educational institution as long as Pestalozzi and his dis- 
ciples were appreciated. But now it is to win its highest triumphs in 
being lifted by interest-mongers upon a higher plane. Already the idol 
of six heads is not many-sided enough. The priest just mentioned has 
increased the number to nineteen different kinds of interests, and 
adds complacently, one might easily find another. The entire matter 
of instruction in the common school is henceforth to be selected and 
arranged exclusively according to these nineteen interests, which our 
reformer presents in an elaborate plan. This he claims to be the ideal 
of a common school. Finally, he remarks: “If, for the purpose of 
accomplishing this end, I have sometimes used other means and ways 
than other people, it must be remembered that the world is mirrored 
differently in different heads.” There, that’s the thing; that’s the char- 
acteristic sign of our times and an inborn fundamental right of the 
modern race. Every individual has the right, from childhood up, to 
think and to will to please himself, and if you demand anything of him 
you must make it suit his interests, of which there are nineteen kinds, 
by the way. 
This autocratic tone becomes more emphatic in another reformer of 
pedagogy, who declares without reservation: “The firmly grooved sys- 
tems of thought acquired during my school time have fallen apart” (he 
formerly belonged to the scientific pedagogues and had “ published 
something” for that school), “and upon the foundation of my original 
ego has arisen a new, free life of thought. I now feel that I am a world 
of my own.” That’s worth hearing. Respect for such an autocrat! 
There are also reformers with less radical demands who might be 
easily dispensed with, since they merely proclaim as new ideas truths 
that have long been known, and who shine chiefly by making erroneous 
additions and arbitrary changes in technical terms of the language, 
thereby adding to the confusion of the pedagogical train of thought. 
Thus we read in an educational journal: 
Much weight has recently been laid by renowned educators upon the demand to 
give children a thoroughly modern education—that is, the children shall grasp 
psychologically, and not only mechanically, what they learn. 
That was not only said recently, but has been recognized and 
demanded by every noted educator of the past, only instead of the 
badly fitting, though scientifically sounding, word “ psychological,” the 
term ‘“self-actively ” was used. 
Again, with the word education they did not merely mean learning, 
although the past master of the scientific pedagogues declares to have
-P-A-G-E-399
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 341 
no idea of education without instruction, while the vulgar pedagogues 
entertain such an idea. 
Another voice is heard saying, ‘In education the laws of develop- 
ment of the human nature must be heeded,” and then this selfsame 
voice recommends authors for whom laws of development in human 
nature have actually not been in existence. However, that this isa 
very old and well-established principle of pedagogy scarcely needs to 
be said, if it was not for the fact that ignorance is most decidedly mod- 
ern. Then, again, we hear some say, “‘ Everything is to be done accord- 
ing to psychological laws,” and others “Everything according to 
physiological laws.” Both parties would do well to agree upon an 
equitable distribution, so that there might be something left for other 
Jaws. “Anthropology must be pressed into the service of dietetics 
and hygiene.” ‘Anthropology and hygiene should be related to each 
other like cause and effect.” Very well, gentlemen, only permit us to 
say that these are well-known commonplaces. 
Often a more high-sounding catchword is sufficient as a basis for a 
reform. To the one a new light has arisen because he has succeeded in 
understanding the word evolution, a term for which we formerly used 
development. To another, because much is said of “ dispositions” nowa- 
days, a term for which we formerly used “faculties.” “Natural” edu- 
cation furthermore is considered of great prominence over “education 
according to nature’s laws;” and a pedagogical lecture, so the report 
says, created a sensational applause because the lecturer reproduced a 
few generally well-known rules of didactics under the captivating title, 
“philosophy of learning.” With these tricks of legerdemain some 
reformers exhibit such satisfaction that one would think they had at 
least invented the differential calculus or the electric light. 
From the foregoing we can plainly see that this senseless chasing 
after educational reforms causes among these numerous adventurers 
irreconcilable contradictions, and confuses ideas that should be per- 
fectly plain. Only one more specially flagrant case of this kind may 
be emphasized. It is the contention concerning ethics. For “whole 
and half-sized Titans” ethics is not in existence any longer, it is merely 
aridiculous fairy story; for speculative investigators in the realm of 
the absolute and other equilibrists it has merely a relative value, while 
for the so-called scientific pedagogues it still is the alpha and omega, 
the only guiding star and end in view of education. Of these theories 
the last-named has been put into circulation as a radical reform idea. 
All instruction, that is to say, also nature study, universal history, 
geography, the explanation of reading matter, singing, ete., shall have 
ethical education in view. This exaggeration and one-sidedness, 
according to which all matter of instruction is to be cut and applied to 
suit ethical reflections, naturally blunts moral feeling rather than 
animates it. To judge from the noise made by the ery, one would be 
justified in thinking: that the art was found at last by which the pillars
-P-A-G-E-400
  342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of ethical order of the world could be deeply and unshakably embedded 
into the soul of every child, and hence also into the soul of the people; 
by which action society, state, and church are forever rescued from 
decay. However, the work of reform has been going on for over a gen- 
eration, and yet no result, nay, not even a beginning of a result, can be 
seen. One may place at every proper and improper occasion strength 
of ethical character as the only aim in education, and enumerate from 
five to nineteen kinds of interests, it will ever make the impression of 
self-sufficient pharisaism, which exhibits before God and man a whole 
register of sterile virtues, and thereby crops out on the one side 
ethical casuistry, on the other side contempt of all morals or their 
reduction to mere means in the battie for existence. And thus the 
fight goes on, the confusion increases, and instead of the motto, “The 
aim of nature study is ethical education,” a younger section of the 
party already twists it into, “The aim of ethics is recognition of 
nature.” Perhaps they will soon find that all treatises on pedagogy 
might very well be replaced by a text-book on cattle breeding. One 
extreme seems to bring forth the other, and since every subjective 
visionary, despising the reign of critical thought, claims equal right 
and the privilege of personal liberty, all possibility of coming to an 
understanding concerning the theory vanishes, and with it the art of 
pursuing the profession of teaching. 
In order to keep the trade going, despite this confusion of leading 
ideas, numerous carters baul new material that is to be distributed by 
diligent teachers among children eager to learn. There is another and 
very extensive species of pedagogical reform literature, namely, the one 
which works according to the principle “cheap and poor.” Its titles 
are guides, manuals, materials, elaborated courses of study, prepara- 
tions, model lessons, ete. Such labors have full justification when they 
are performed for students of normal schools by real masters of prac- 
tice, but when they are compiled by bunglers, with criminal careless- 
ness, and offered to teachers of long experience as “easy roads” they 
become pons asinorum, about which one is in doubt whether they 
derive their name from their architects or from the people who pass 
over them. The ready sale which such works find at present does not 
throw a favorable light upon the professional education of teachers, 
since it proves that many of its members do not get their matter from 
scientific sources, but obtain it in rations from bunglers’ compilations, 
and moreover, that they constantly need methodical aid. Looking over 
the entire pedagogical literature of the day, a large part of it makes 
the impression that the opinion is prevalent that he who can read and 
write is called upon to act as author. 
Under such circumstances we need not wonder that an anxious 
educator says: 
I am astonished that, despite all the accusations brought forth by the reformers 
and despite all the reform projects advanced, no improvement is shown anywhere.
-P-A-G-E-401
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 343 
Our educators [he continues] seem to suffer in recent years of the writers’ fever, for 
everyone who has grasped a new idéa (new, of course, to him) seems to be impelled 
to put it on paper, in order to furnish a contribution to theoretical and practical, 
pathological and psychological pedagogy. 
And in his holy anger over this confusion he cries out: 
May our learned and pedagogical leaders give us at last a solid, unified system of 
education, quite immaterial whether it is according to Herbart, Diesterweg, or any- 
oncelse. Give it especially to the common school, an edifice which stands unshakable 
and which will hold out against the most cavilous pedagogical attacks. 
To be sure, when year after year the degenerate race of our days 
throws mud upon the master works of its great ancestors, and again 
and again proclaims that it has overturned these master works; when 
the thoughtless publie believes these boasters and allows itself to be 
led by the nose by every new prophet; when in the realm of the spirit 
anarchy becomes epidemic—then every friend of well-systematized 
action would be satisfied with any system, provided it could stand. 
But whence shall such a system come, and how can it be secured 
against attack in this interminable wrangling that reminds one of the 
Babylonian tower? 
It is never well when a nation suddenly leaves the tracks of its cul- 
tural development and either throws the precious inheritance of its 
fathers wantonly through the window or apathetically leaves it lying in 
the corner. Then periods of degeneration and decay will occur, such 
as German history records in the tenth and eleventh, in the fourteenth 
and fifteenth, and again in the seventeenth century, and finally in our 
own days. Happy is the nation which in such periods retains a sound 
core of people who love to think of their ancestry, who lovingly keep the 
tradition of their ideals, maintain the procession forward and upward, 
and see to it that under more favorable circumstances sooner or later a 
renaissance of the whole nation may take place. Our German nation has 
had several of them, and it is to be hoped that it will have another in the 
future. The glory and greatness of our nation during the nineteenth 
century has been caused by powerful impulses which it received from 
the master works ofits great thinkers and poets, either immediately or 
through the aid of popularization which made common property of the 
foundations of a high-minded mode of thinking, of a flourishing culture 
in all domains of the national life, and of a triumphant development of 
the power of self-preservation, These guiding stars of all higher aspi- 
rations have been followed by German pedagogy, partly by examining 
the most distinguished ancient and foreign works concerning education 
with newly gained standard measures and ideas, partly by self-active 
remodeling, as was done by Pestalozzi and his school. All great sys- 
tematic pedagogues of Germany, quite immaterial whether they were 
Protestants, like Niemeyer and Schwarz, or Catholics, like Milde and 
Sailer, were one in their enthusiasm for our great thinkers and poets, 
in whom they had clarified and improved their own minds and had 
warmed and exalted their hearts.
-P-A-G-E-402
  344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
When men of this kind promoted German pedagogy, it had a scien- 
tific character, because these men had themselves a solid scientific edu- 
cation, and therefore worked scientifically. But since some scientific 
swindlers have assumed the réle of prophets, and collected around 
themselves a number of unripe youths and drilled them into bold char- 
latans, shameless defamers, and servile mercenaries, scientific pedagogy 
has become an object of mockery and scandal, of which the worst is 
not said when it is likened unto a traveling menagerie before which 
screaming parrots hang on chains in order to allure the public to enter 
the tent, so that they may see the antics of the trained buffoons. But 
when this race of pigmies has the insolence to brand the entire older 
science of pedagogy as trivial and vulgar, it is not aimed at Pestalozzi 
and his school only, but also against other educators whose systems 
are related to his. Likewise is it aimed at Kant, the inexorable critic 
of all scientific illusion; therefore against all profoundly thinking 
philosophers, as well as against Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, and all other 
great lights of the nation. It seems quite natural that the great 
must be pulled down into the dust so that the pigmies may rise. For- 
merly the rule prevailed, “judge not things of which you understand 
nothing,” but for these modern original geniuses that 1 ule belongs to the 
recipes of vulgar schoolmasters, recipes that deserve to be thrown into 
the pedagogical rubbish chamber. What could a genuine original 
reformer say if that ancient orthodox rule held good for him? To 
enter upon a profound study of the classic writers of our profession the 
younger generation has not sufficient brain or diligence, and they have 
an instinctive horror of that kind of study, because they suspect that 
under a single step of one of such giants of the spirit a whole swarm 
of one-day flies will be killed. May they try to make the world 
happy. Within the present century the German nation has performed 
great deeds with that spirit which is derived from “vulgar” sources. 
Let us hope that in future, amid new dangers, a greater race will accom- 
plish greater things. We men advanced in years may go to rest with 
good consciences. Vivant sequentes.1 
Meanwhile the new way of salvation is only in the first stage of fer- 
mentation, and therefore let us use our power in order to check by an 
occasional warning word the frenzy of unbridled passion for reform, 
and remind the profession of the inalienable foundations of a prosper- 
ous development of culture. For there is danger that the wild cur- 
rents of the time, acting destructively upon thoughts and aspirations 
and incapable of actual creations, will contribute toward strengthening 
reactionary movements, which are at present already actively promoted 
by church and state authorities. The aim toward which reactionary

powers and anarchistic agitation hasten has been characterized by a 
thoughtful observer (Tacitus) who meant it for another period when he 
said: ‘“‘Ruere in servitium !” 
Though it may seem useless to trouble one’s self to oppose the cur- 
rent of the time, yet an honest man perceives it to be the command of 
duty to withstand indefatigably that which he considers foolish and 
destructive, and to defend steadfastly that which he considers true and 
good. Such a combat is not by any means hopeless. There is a sound 
core of men in the German nation and among German educators who 
will not consider servitude under the public authority, an authority 
that crushes all personal individual life, as a fundamental condition of 
general welfare and an indispensable presupposition of every science, 
nor will they consider the restless play of the waves of individual arbi- 
trariness, but will insist upon freedom under the laws of reason. 
II.—SUPPLEMENTARY AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS IN GERMANY. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The article on the schools of Berlin published in the last Annual 
Report of this Bureau confined itself to elementary or common schools 
that accommodate the children of all strata of society between the 
ages 6 and 14. Secondary schools as well as institutions for industrial 
education are not mentioned. In the following an attempt is made to 
sketch the efforts made in Germany, and particularly ‘in Berlin, to fur- 
ther prepare for the duties of life the children of the poorer strata of 
society, after they have completed the course prescribed for elementary 
schools. Berlin sets an example for the whole Empire in establishing a 
system of supplementary or continuation schools, as well as schools in 
which trades or, generally speaking, industrial pursuits are taught. 
These institutions are the result of the widespread conviction that 
preparation is necessary for every kind of work, and the frequency 
with which skilled labor is found in Germany bears witness to the good 
result of the institutions mentioned which have enlisted the attention 
of educators far and near. 
That this kind of educational instruction becomes more and more 
desirable for this country may be seen from the following quotations. 
The Literary Digest, commenting on the scarcity of skilled workmen, 
recently said: 
In view of the lack of employment which, even in ‘good times,” compels thousands 
of workmen to lead a life of enforced idleness, and of the attempts made in several 
States to provide this “army of the unemployed” with work and wages, it is sur- 
prising to learn, on the authority of the Iron Age, that the increasing activity in the 
iron and steel trades is developing a scarcity of skilled workmen, and that the supply 
of fit men is steadily growing smaller. In some branches of these trades, we are

  346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
told, considerable uneasiness is now felt over the outlook for the future, and this is 
especially the case in those lines in which a long apprenticeship is required. Regard- 
ing the causes of this scarcity, the Iron Age says: 
“‘This is one of the inevitable effects of a protracted season of dullness in a trade. 
Good men are the least disposed toremain unemployed for any length of time. Pre- 
ferring to continue in the occupation for which they are specially fitted by reason of 
their training, they will perhaps await for a reasonable period the resumption of 
business in the establishment in which they were employed, but when day after day 
passes with no sign of starting they turn their attention in some other direction and 
accept the best chance offered. Some take such money as they have saved and 
embark in business for themselves. Ina few months after a concern closes down its 
organization is scattered to the four quarters, and the same men can not possibly be 
collected. A large percentage of them has drifted into other trades, and either will 
not or can not return to their old occupations. It might be supposed that the intro- 
duction of so much labor-saving machinery in iron and steel works, which has been 
a conspicuous feature in recent progress, would go far toward throwing on the labor 
market an oversupply of workmen, but these changes after all have not been so far- 
reaching as the plaints of labor leaders would have us believe. Like all other move- 
ments in the direction of progress, their effect has been temporary, and the displaced 
workmen haye evidently found other occupations. The question can be pertinently 
asked: If old methods werestill in vogue in our great iron and steel works, how could 
a sufficient force of skilled workmen be obtained? It now appears to be absolutely 
necessary to devise further means of conducting manufacturing operations by labor- 
saving machinery if the supply of workmen can not in some way be augmented.” 
Not only are skilled workmen scarce, but it seems that there is an 
absolute dearth of qualified men to direct departments in manufactur- 
ing establishments. The Iron Age says: 
Our mechanical progress appears to be developing at a rate of speed out of pro- 
portion to the conventional methods of preparing men to fill the exacting duties now 
required of them. Within the past few years new industries have grown at a mar- 
velous rate, which have made heavy drafts on the ranks of those who either were or 
were apparently destined to become leaders in the older industries. Opportunities 
for more rapid advancement or for better financial returns have been seen in the 
electrical business, in the tin-plate trade, or in the manufacture of bicycles or some 
other comparatively new line. Again, the growth of old works has advanced men 
of ability in department work to positions of more general supervision, and yacan- 
cies have thus been created which are hard to fill. Some of our largest manufactur- 
ing companies, who from their position would appear to be well equipped with a 
technical and practical staff of the most ample proportions, are constantly on the 
lookout for men of ability and practical and scientific knowledge to fill positions of 
the character above indicated. Of the mediocre or unskilled we shall probably 
have no lack, even if a much greater condition of activity should be favoring the iron 
trade. The tide of immigration is again turning toward our shores, attracted by the 
reports of improving business. But the highest grade of workmen can not be 
recruited from that source. It must essentially be a home product, trained in 
American methods, dominated by American ideas, and gifted with American ambition. 
Discussing the facts brought out by the Iron Age, the New York 
Evening Postdeclares that the situation can not be adequately explained 
by temporary dislocations of labor, but must be referred to more per- 
manent and general causes. It expresses its own view as follows: 
In the light of such confessions the old proverb, “‘There is always room at the 
top,” might be reversed into ‘‘ There is no room at the bottom;” and this, indeed, is 
the commercial situation to-day: There is but little room for the incompetent, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 347 
ignorant, or the lazy in the ranks of those employed by our large corporations. We 
haye no lack of unskilled laborers, but, unless all industrial signs fail, these must 
take a place in our civilization even lower than hitherto. 
This demand for better knowledge and greater skill is one which is common to all 
trades and professions. The poorly equipped physician or lawyer is less and less 
in request. In conducting large enterprises, the capab!o manager finds his services 
more and more in demand and commanding higher rewards. In this compulsory 
advance toward greater excellence, education plays an-important part. The Penn- 
sylvania Railroad has long held to the policy of requiring the young men entering 
its mechanical departments to have some technical training, both in theory and 
practice. The technical colleges supply a part of this requirement, while not a few 
men, particularly in the newer sciences like applied electricity, are pioneer discoy- 
erers by right of research and study. Everywhere it is the same; the professional 
or business man, as well as the employee, to succeed in modern commercial strife 
must have all the resources which knowledge and training can give him. * * * 
The dearth of qualified experts and the scarcity of skilled workmen in the iron and 
steel trades are indications at once of the new demand for more efficient laborers and 
of the opportunities thus offered to the deserving. 
  Considerations like the foregoing make it appear desirable to see 
how in Germany this question was faced. Authorities agreed that the 
excellent results of the French textile industries, and the great value 
of the product of French art industry, were not owing to the great 
innate talents of French laborers, but to their thorough and very 
appropriate schooling in labor. This special education “ad hoc” has 
been going on in France from the’time of Colbert, the minister of finance 
during the reign of Louis XIV. Indisputable proofs of this were fur- 
nished by the various world’s expositions, which opened the eyes of 
intelligent men to the great inadequacy of the institutions for industrial 
education prior to 1870, and it may be said that German industry there- 
upon took an upward start most gratifying in its results, since it was 
consistently planned and aided by the establishment of a large number 
of institutions for technical and industrial pursuits. 
No attempt has hitherto been made to present in a concise treatise 
the subject of the condition and organization of Prussian continuation 
and industrial schools in general, and those of Berlin in particular. 
This deficiency, together with the fact that the limits of the different 
kinds of continuation schools are hard to define and not infrequently 
encroach upon one another, increases the difficulty of a presentation 
which is based upon official reports and the contributions of an Aus- 
trian specialist who himself inspected the institutions of Prussia. 
Many boys in Germany leave the common school before they have 
attained the end it has in view. They can not express their own 
thoughts distinctly and intelligibly, correctly understand the expres- 
sion of the thoughts of others, or give a quick and correct solution of 
simple arithmetical problems, either mentally or in writing. These 
aequirements are indispensable, however, to the mechanic as well as the 
farmer, to carry on his trade or follow his pursuit with advantage, and 
to protect himself against losses. Common schools are deterred by 
many circumstances from gaining their object in every detail; domestic
-P-A-G-E-406
  
  348 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
relations, the poverty or indifference of parents, great distance from 
school, sickness among children, overcrowding of the schoolroom, 
which prevents even excellent teachers from giving sufficient attention 
to each pupil, and finally, compulsory attendance, in the greater part 
of the State, being enforced insufficiently—all these causes contribute 
to the difficulties with which the elementary schools have to contend. 
In Prussia, as in other German States, all these causes have for many 
years combined to urge the establishment of continuation or supple- 
mentary schools. Until twenty years ago little attention was paid to 
this subject in the old provinces of the Kingdom; less even than in those 
acquired in 1866. As early as 1844 the department of public instruc- 
tion issued a report to all governments of provinces commenting upon 
the usefulness of such schools and advising the cooperation of clergy 
and teachers. At theend of two years a second report proved that an 
interest was manifested in only a few places where industrial activity 
necessitated a more advanced education than elementary schools afford. 
The absence of interest in the establishment of such schools was per- 
haps owing to the fact that the Government had not emphasized its 
encouragement by any pecuniary allowance. 
Other conditions prevailed in the provinces acquired in 1866. In 
Nassau and Hanover industrial schools, so-called continuation schools, 
received appropriations from the State which Prussia transferred to the 
account of the department of commerce and continued to pay. After 
much consideration and discussion it was decided to increase this State 
appropriation for 1874, and turn it over to the minister of public instruc- 
tion under the head of “‘ Appropriations for industrial and continuation 
schools.” In this way, the inequality resulting from the fact that the 
industrial schools of some parts of the State received assistance from 
the State, while the continuation schools of others received none, was 
removed in principle. The different official boards were advised to give 
the most assiduous care to existing institutions of this kind as well as 
to promote in a proper way the establishment of others; and, as far as 
possible, to aim at the establishment of supplementary schools in the 
industrial cities of each province. Communities are called upon to defray 
the cost of buildings, heat, light, and at least one-half of all other expenses 
not covered by actual receipts from tuition fees. An official order of 1878 
compels factory owners and managers not only to permit their workmen 
under 18 years of age to attend continuation schools obligatory by local 
statute, but to allow every individual attending them the amount of 
time decided upon by competent authority. Consequently as journey- 
men, apprentices, or workmen could not be prevented from attending 
the optional continuation schools without the employer’s incurring the 
tisk of punishment, the department of public instruction was ever more 
ready to allow larger appropriations for the support of these institu- 
tions. In most cases, communities were willing to undertake the 
improvement of existing schools and the necessary enlargement of
-P-A-G-E-407
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 349 
classes consequent upon increased attendance only when the State 
voted appropriations for the expenses entailed. Concerning rural con- 
tinuation schools, it must be said that the institutions are not distin- 
guished as rural or industrial (city) schools from their situation in a 
country or city district, but from the arrangement of appropriate 
instruction for the wants of the majority of pupils. In rural schools 
the curriculum includes instruction in the mother tongue, arithmetic, 
mensuration, nature study through object lessons and where practica- 
ble by experiment, geography, native history, singing, gymnastics, and 
drawing. As all these studies can not be pursued at the same time, a 
selection is made and an interchange effected in view of the previous 
education of the pupil, the capacity of the teacher, special local condi- 
tions, and the number of hours per week. In every case care should 
be taken (so the order reads) that the school do not assume the charac- 
ter of a technical school, but consider as its end in view the completion 
and extension of common school education and the strengthening of 
ethical character. Instruction should be given at least during four 
hours a week; fewer hours are permitted only in communities where 
local conditions make a reduction in time imperative. 
The rural continuation schools of Prussia are inconsiderable in num- 
ber and are unequally distributed among the different districts. As 
communities, besides furnishing the buildings, as well as heat and light, 
until recently bore half, and at present bear at least a third of the other 
expenses, not covered by a rather large school tax, the number of these 
schools is proportionately small and varying. In many places every 
summer the question is decided anew whether instruction, almost every- 
where limited to the winter season or to a few winter months, and not 
infrequently to fewer than four hours a week, shall be continued during 
the following winter. The decision of different communities is influ- 
enced by their temporary financial condition or the result of the har- 
vest. In the year 1890 rural continuation schools numbered 727, with 
11,144 pupils. Perhaps interest in these institutions would be greater 
than at present if they were given over to the minister of agricul- 
ture, public domains, and forests. This question is at present under 
discussion. 
Industrial or city continuation schools consist of two grades of sev- 
eral classes each. The instruction given in the lowest grade advances 
the general education of pupils with special reference to their calling, 
and consequently practically embraces all subjects of the higher classes 
of advanced common schools excepting religion. The special aim of 
the advanced grades is the pupil’s acquirement of industrial proficiency ; 
in the selection of studies, local industrial relations are taken into con- 
sideration. In 1884 the minister of public instruction maintained, in 
anaddress to all provincial governments, that in all continuation schools 
which devote at most six hours a week to instruction, the course of 
study must be limited to language, arithmetic, and the beginning 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
350 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of geometry and drawing; in other words, to the studies most impor- 
tant for trade and minor industries. In language, the common-school 
instruction is simply continued—distinct, intelligent reading, reviewing 
the reading matter, orthography, punctuation, and grammar. Stress 
is also laid on improvement in penmanship. No special instruction is 
given in grammar, or as a rule in penmanship; and, as it is impossible 
to treat history, geography, and nature studies as special branches, the 
German school reader offers suitable popular selections and extracts 
from standard works of natural sciences, whose text is to be analyzed 
in the reading class and appropriated by the pupil by means of verbal 
or short written reviews. The pupils are also instructed to compose 
letters, addresses, short compositions of business import, and the like. 
Single-entry bookkeeping is also taught in the upper grade, either in 
connection with language work or with arithmetic, which, like other 
branches, begins where the common school left off. In the lower classes 
attention is paid to the four fundamental principles of arithmetic, 
with denominate and undenominate numbers and common and decimal 
fractions; metric measures, weights, and German coins, and commer- 
cial calculations are practiced; the examples of proportion, interest, 
discount, profit and loss, etc., are practical applications of business 
necessities, As a knowledge of the first principles of geometry is 
indispensable to the practical demands of many industries, the pupil 
is so far advanced that he can calculate the perimeter and contents of 
plane figures bounded by straight lines, the contents of bodies with 
flat surfaces, and the sphere. Four hours out of eight per week, 
and where only six are given, two per week, are devoted to drawing; 
it is omitted only with four hours of instruction a week. In the larger 
continuation schools with more time, greater pecuniary resources, and 
better teachers at their disposal, the curriculum is more comprehensive, 
Instruction in mathematics is more advanced, mechanics and physics 
are also taught, and professional drawing is taught with a view to 
certain industries. 
By industrial continuation schools, we understand all institutions 
which offer the opportunity to anyone engaged in industrial pursuits 
of any branch or condition whatever, whether apprentices, journeymen, 
or masters engaged in labor during the day, to acquire a partly general, 
partly professional, education, always based upon the necessity of a 
practical business life. This instruction is given during their leisure, 
i. e.,on Sundays or during the evening hours of week days. As arule, 
these schools are connected either with other industrial institutions, or 
with burgher and intermediate schools, the class rooms and appliances 
of which are at their disposal and whose teachers they employ. The 
State pays the greater part of the expenses. Since the passage of a 
law in 1886, purely public trade schools exist only in west Prussia and 
Posen, but only in the larger centers of industry. Instruction here is 
entirely gratuitous and obligatory for all workmen not over 18 years
-P-A-G-E-409
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 351 
of age. This law was a political measure aimed at repressing the 
efforts of demagogues to gain disciples among the young, and preserv- 
ing and developing in children the elements of a German education 
begun in the common schools. In 1890 there existed altogether 159 of 
such trade schools, with 12,000 pupils in round numbers, while Prussia 
numbers 1,105 industrial continuation schools. 
Besides the above mentioned there are a number of private schools 
which are simple industrial continuation schools established by socie- 
ties, labor unions, or guilds. Barbers and hairdressers have the great- 
est numbers of technical schools; 58 out of the 67 exclude elementary 
instruction; painters have 29; tailors and blacksmiths, 24; shoemakers, 
24; bakers, 21; tailors, 20; cabinetmakers and builders, each 10; 
masons, 6; locksmiths and butchers, each 5; paper hangers and tin- 
smiths, each 4; wheelwrights, 6; glaziers, saddlers, bookbinders, pot- 
ters, and innkeepers, each 2; confectioners, chimney sweeps, dentists, 
gardeners, baskét makers, and bricklayers, each 1. The necessity for 
technical schools does not exist in the same degree among the different 
trades and occupations. For barbers and hairdressers a common tech- 
nical school is the shortest way and the one best calculated to save the 
master time and labor in perfecting the apprentice in certain branches, 
Customers who care to be shaved and have their hair dressed free of 
charge give beginners the opportunity of practicing. One person can 
teach the art of making wigs to many at the same time; so, too, a 
physician or clever surgeon can give better instruction in the services to 
be rendered in case of accident than most barbers. In a similar way 
the theory of horseshoeing is taught in these schools by experienced 
veterinarians. Nevertheless, as far as the education of apprentices by 
means of instruction is concerned, a guild can geti along without estab- 
lishing its own school if its members be compelled to allow their 
apprentices the benefits of the local industrial continuation school, and 
see that they attend regularly and punctually and are supplied with 
the necessary school requisites. In this case, the society should attend 
to individual complaints about absence and breach of discipline, main- 
tain the rights of the school toward the apprentice, punish disobedience 
with expulsion from apprenticeship, strengthen the reputation of the 
school on every occasion. and endeavor to keep up a relationship with 
its teachers. 
Certain institutions are to be regarded as a sort of medium between 
actual continuation and technical schools. Besides Sunday and night 
instruetion for all kinds of industries, these transition schools, so to 
speak, during the day in winter instruct classes arranged for those 
industrial artists, painters, modelers, ete., who have comparatively 
little to do during the winter months, and can then attend schools. 
For this reason several of such institutions have received the name of 
industrial art schools, in which a preference is claimed for Sunday and. 
night instruction. The conditions for admission are: A completed
-P-A-G-E-410
  352 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
common-school course, a required age, and a certain amount of prac- 
tical preparatory knowledge. In general, the arrangement of studies 
on the one hand is planned ‘so that instruction during the less busy 
season is a systematic continuation of work for such persons as are 
practically engaged in trades, as apprentices, journeymen, etc. On the 
other hand, the essential part of daily instruction is organized as a 
preparatory course for a regular technical school. In that case the 
Sunday and night school is called preparatory; the day school, technical, 
with classes arranged accordingly. 
The trade school of Berlin is the most comprehensive and most per- 
fectly equipped institution of its kind. It was founded in 1880 after 
the model of the general industrial school in Hamburg, whose director, 
Professor Jessen, was called to the principalship of the new institution 
in the capital city. The opening took place in the now demolished 
prince’s residence in the old mint at the Werder market place. In 
1886 a new building was completed. The State appropriates 20,000 
marks, the city 90,000 marks a year for its maintenance. An advanced 
Sunday and night school, attended in the winter of 1889-90 by 2,074 
apprentices and journeymen, forms the preparatory department of this 
institution. To this are added two day classes for cabinetmakers and 
painters and the technical school for mechanics. The Sunday and 
night school is divided according to separate courses of instruction. 
Drawing, as the most essential branch, is taught four hours a week, 
and lessons from two to four hours long are given to classes, so that 
pupils can be occupied eight hours a week. The lessons embrace 
demonstrative geometry, mechanics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, 
electro-technology, arithmetic, and bookkeeping. 
On the whole no less than 121 courses of four and two hours a week 
and engaging 28 teachers were maintained during the winter of 1889-90. 
Elementary and professional drawing are taught, and modeling and 
painting practiced. How a large attendance and a sufficient individual 
representation of a multiplicity of industries complicate the manage- 
ment of such a school is seen from the course in professional drawing 
divided according to trades; in 1889-90 it comprised not fewer than 35 
courses of four hours weekly for 13 different trades. For joiners and 
turners, 3 courses; for tinsmiths and locksmiths, 4; for machinists, 1; 
for instrument makers and opticians, 3; for watchmakers, 1; for jewelers 
and engravers, 1; for beltmakers, 1; for masons and carpenters, 4; for 
bricklayers, 1; for sculptors, 2; for painters, 8; for upholsterers, 4; for 
lithographers, 3; in each 30 to 40 pupils were instructed. The method of 
instruction in all drawing lessons rests preeminently on a strictly con- 
sistent application of life study, whereby very favorable results are 
obtained. A special, large building of model arrangement, with electric 
light for night instruction, abundant collections of accessories and 
appliances, and all that pertains to a complete school equipment, 
together with an excellent corps of teachers, are at the disposal of the 
institution.
-P-A-G-E-411
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 853 
The Austrian specialist who inspected this school proposes that the 
trade school be brought into a suitable organic connection with all the 
other industrial continuation schools of Berlin. If the central institu- 
tion were intrusted with the direction or supervision of all the elemen- 
tary continuation schools, it would tend to make all serve a uniform 
purpose and facilitate their development. The higher educational aim 
of the central trade school, and the more thorough preparation other 
institutions would then give, suggest thisreform. Much more valuable 
individual accomplishments might be effected by such a union. 
A technical school for mechanical engineers is found in connection 
with the trade schoolin Berlin. Its particular purpose is the education. 
of foremen and managers of mechanical industries, and especially of 
expert mechanicians and electricians. The studies comprise a half 
year’s course, which can be extended to a year, and are taught during 
the forenoon only. 
The trade school of Berlin, in which 42 teachers were employed in 
1890, besides a director and assistant director, has repeatedly estab- 
lished winter courses for the-higher education of drawing teachers in 
industrial continuation schools. It exerts a marked influence on the 
improvement of industrial instruction, not only in the capital, but also 
in many other cities, as Magdeburg and Hanover, where such schools 
have been enlarged, reorganized, or newly established, entirely in 
imitation of the model of the one in Berlin. 
By foremen’s schools we understand the lower industrial schools 
with day instruction, arranged for a whole group of industries. Their 
curriculum and methods are adapted to a general grade, which need 
not rank above a good common school, and they admit only practically 
educated pupils. Their aim is to offer young and old laborers the oppor- 
tunities of gaining in the shortest possible time such technical knowl- 
edge and ability as can not be acquired in practice or in an industrial 
continuation school, but is indispensable with the present demands upon 
a self-dependent manager or foreman in industrial pursuits. 
Certain branches of industrial pursuits taken collectively are dis- 
tinctly separate from others, but may be classed into a greater or 
smaller number of industrial subdivisions. By being apparently 
related through their common intellectual foundation, they are natu- 
rally combined in one group. There area number of such branches for 
whose perfect practice a certain amount of development in art and a 
knowledge of mathematics, mechanics, and chemistry is generally pre- 
supposed. To such groups belong the building trades, the mechanic 
and technological branches, the chemical industry, and the industrial 
arts. 
Schools for such branches are sparingly represented in Prussia. The 
most frequent are builders’ schools, which are entirely self-supporting 
institutions. The institution in Berlin, numbering 1,289 pupils (in 1891, 
1,192), was formerly connected with the trade school. Its graduates

  354 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
who pass the final examination, based upon the order issued in 1882 by 
royal commission, enjoy certain advantages in their occupations. Their 
diploma, in pursuance of the decision passed by the society of German 
builders in the year 1888, is accepted in place of the theoretical part 
of the test examination required by the laws of the society. All build- 
ers’ unions are further advised in case of special vacancies to consider 
the graduates of builders’ schools, to whom, moreover, the Government 
positions of road and station masters of railroads are open. Since 1891 
the so-called Samaritan course on “first assistance in cases of accident” 
is delivered in these institutions. A six weeks’ course of instruction 
‘given by a physician consists of two successive hours a week, of which 
one is devoted to a lecture, the other to practical exercises. Itis intended 
to introduce the same instruction into technical schools for machinists 
and the larger weaving schools. 
The various textile industries of Berlin are numerously represented. 
The number of active, self-dependent master weavers in the capital 
city was, in 1888, estimated at 3,000, with 2,000 journeymen and 500 
apprentices; the number of handlooms in operation amounted to 5,000, 
while the automatic looms, attended mostly by girls under a foreman, 
numbered 2,000. To these must be added 1,200 ordinary leoms with 
300 masters and 500 journeymen and apprentices; and, finally, sey- 
eral hundred passementerie and 100 chenille looms. Between 4,000 
and 5,000 workmen are supposed to be engaged in passementerie hand- 
work. The United Loom Societies established a weavers’ school, which 
was controlled by the State, in 1883, and-.supported by appropriations 
from eyen other manufacturers’ societies, both local and in other proy- 
inees and states. As the rooms utilized for instruction, limited to 
Sunday, were by no means sufficient, the city in 1888 decided upon 
rebuilding, having the assurance that the state government in future 
wwould supply half of the eurrent expenses not covered by actual 
receipts and equip the institution with the necessary new machines, 
looms, and other perquisites. The building was completed in 1890 at a 
cost of 180,000 marks, including the cost of the site. It offered the 
possibility of enlarging Sunday and night classes so that they 
eould accommodate 450 weavers and passementerers. The new build- 
ing also afforded opportunity for the establishment of a day weaving 
school of an upper and a lower grade, each with a one year’s course. 
Sunday and night instruetion is free to all apprentices and journeymen 
resident or at work in Berlin; the trustees have granted the same priv- 
ileges to those belonging to nonresident societies. Others pay 24 
marks annually; day pupils 100 marks the first year and 300 marks the 
second. The accounts of 1890-91 close with an expenditure of 49,060 
marks, of which 14,000 were raised from tuition fees; the remainder 
was advanced by the state and city, each paying 17,500 marks. The 
institution is fully equipped with looms and apparatus, for the purchase 
of which the State, for 1890-91, appropriated an extra sum of 53,400 
marks.
-P-A-G-E-413
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 355 
As has been stated, societies can establish and control industrial 
trade schools, provided they observe certain conditions; and the city 
authorities have the right to allow these institutions the use of city 
buildings and defray the expense of heat and light. Berlin has 8 of such 
guild schools, 1 each for printers, painters, tailors, wig makers and 
hairdressers, stone masons and bookbinders, and 2 for bakers. The 
other 12 technical schools, 1 each for masons and carpenters, cabinet- 
makers, saddlers, painters, chimney sweeps, barbers and hairdressers, 
wheelwrights, glaziers, shoemakers, blacksmiths, upholsterers, and 
basket braiders, have been established by communities, and are sup- 
ported by guilds. The State contributes to the support of 8 of them. 
Several of these institutions sensibly confine themselves. to the pursuit 
of purely technical knowledge and acquirements; pupils, therefore, are 
referred to continuation schools for their general industrial education, 
The majority, however, devote most of their time to language, arith- 
metic, drawing, and reading. The latter can hardly be called purely 
technical schools, and their pupils derive little advantage for business. 
This reflection applies preeminently, perhaps exclusively, to guild 
schools. 
The Berlin art school, besides preparing pupils for the art academy 
and educating drawing teachers for higher educational institutions, 
has for its purpose the instruction of industrial artists in drawing, 
painting, and modeling, and therefore serves as a preparatory school 
for the technical class of the royal industrial art museum. The indus- 
trial art school connected with the last-mentioned educational imstitu- 
tion omits from its night courses not only all preparatory branches, as 
elementary, free-hand, and geometrical drawing, drawing from casts, 
modeling, ete., but also all studies taught by lectures, as anatomy 
and projection. The school is accommodated in the side halls of the 
museum and comprises classes for the making of furniture, apparatus, 
etc., for modeling, chasing, engraving, copperplating, etching, artistic 
eabinetmaking, decorative and figure painting. 
Male and female pupils are admitted, and number over 500. 
In connection with the royal manufactory of porcelain in Berlin there 
exists a school for painters and modelers, the perceptible extension 
and improvement of which, since 1886, corresponds to the progress in 
pictorial decoration and the plastic formation of the products of the 
factory. A separate hall is set aside for painters, in which advanced 
students are regularly instrueted during the whole forenoon of week 
days and for a few hours on Sunday. The classes are attended not 
only by journeymen, but, as far as the orders for work justify it, by 
many painters of advanced years, numbering on the whole over 40. If 
painters have devoted a long time exclusively to porcelain, they are 
obliged to occupy themselves for several weeks exclusively with orna- 
mental and nature studies, for which the gardens and greenhouses of 
the factory supply the plants and blossoms. Journeymen are admitted
-P-A-G-E-414
  356 OBDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
only when they show decided talent. Strange to say, private factories, 
until now, have expressed no desire to have their employed painters 
and modelers educated at the state institution; they are probably of 
the opinion that the royal porcelain factory in educating such persons 
is consulting its own needs only. Owing to the lack of room it is at 
present impossible to admit modelers; but painters’ apprentices, even 
in smaller numbers, are not refused. Perhaps the difference in the 
manner of decorating existing between the royal factory and private 
factories is the reason why none of the latter has attempted to make 
use of the State school as a technical school for porcelain painters. 
The chief administration of the Prussian industrial school system 
has in the course of the last decade repeatedly suffered changes and 
removal by having been transferred from the department of commerce 
and industry to that of public instruction and back again. At present 
the administration is divided. The higher industrial educational insti- 
tutions, the Industrial Art Museum and its affiliated school in Berlin, 
the Art School of Berlin and the Industrial Art School of Breslau, are 
under the direction of the minister of instruction. All other industrial 
schools are under the minister of commerce and industry. 
Finally, Berlin possesses two business colleges, the first of which was 
founded in 1885 by private merchants and a union of merchants’ guilds. 
In comparison with other German cities, Berlin was backward. in this 
respect. Jor fifteen years the resident city of the Hohenzollern had 
been the capital of the Empire, the center of politics, and the leader of 
German trade; but neither the State nor the city, neither the corpo- 
ration of merchants nor a single one of the great societies of merchants, 
had thought of providing Berlin with one of such important—in fact, 
indispensable—institutions, while more than a hundred already existed 
in the large, small, and even most insignificant cities of the Kingdom. 
After much contention and many difficulties, there now exist two such 
~ institutions, for whose accommodation the city has allowed the use of two 
secondary school buildings. The tuition fee amounts to 36 marks per 
annum and opens all departments to the pupils attending. Instruction 
is given four nights a week, from 8 to 10 o’clock. Every pupil has the 
right to select his own course of study and belongs to both institutions 
at the same time, as the hours of instruction do not conflict. The 
faculty consists of 30 members, the number of pupils averages 1,300, 
and the curriculum includes commercial geography, exchange and busi- 
nessrules. The State appropriates 800 marks annually for both schools. 
At the meeting of the Prussian Diet on the 25th of February, 1894, 
Minister von Berlepch explained, during the discussion of the appropri- 
ation bill for the “industrial school system,” that the Government 
deemed the promotion of business colleges indispensable. This asser- 
tion was provoked by the accounts of different business departments, 
which nearly all justly complain of the deficient education of young 
merchants.
-P-A-G-E-415
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 857 
Unfortunately, the Government has perceptibly curtailed the allow- 
ance for continuation schools, thereby verifying the assertion of Ben- 
ingsen that there seems to be deplorably little money left for educational 
demands. The Government advocates the introduction of compulsory 
attendance, which is already enforced in all the larger German States. 
If we include the city continuation schools and all other similar insti- 
tutions, even those not supported by the state, besides the different 
technical schools, over 17,000 persons, or about 40 per cent of the num- 
ber under obligation to attend continuation schools, attended indus- 
trial classes during the winter of 1891. The Government recognizes the 
indisputable necessity of a normal school for teachers of continuation 
schools, so that they may receive more thorough instruction than the 
present short course of drawing offers. It considers the introduction 
of a regular supervision of industrial continuation schools, which is at 
present almost entirely wanting, as not less urgent or important. 
The memorial of Councilor Liiders on technical education in Prussia 
concludes with the following words: 
The administrative authorities of industrial education feel sure of receiving the 
appropriations necessary for the present needs and further development of the con- 
tinuation schools. 
Continuation schools are the only places where, outside of the work- 
shop, hundreds of thousands acquire technical knowledge and _ profi- 
ciency, and next to the church they are the only places where thousands, 
and particularly all who do not enter the army after leaving the com- 
mon school, are receiving ethical education, are counseled to practice 
civil virtue, and trained to order and discipline. If instruction, as it 
must be, is given in the proper spirit, pupils are not only materially 
benefited, but they are morally strengthened and awakened to the con- 
sciousness that man does not live by bread alone. Whoever is less 
affected by the ethical than the economical value of industrial continua- 
tion schools and industrial education will, nevertheless, recognize the 
necessity of the powerful and immediate claim expressed by an intelli- 
gent Frenchman, who says: “The best instructed industry is at present 
"the strongest.” Observation convinces one that the working people 
depend in a great measure upon industrial education, and that many 
skilled laborers, designers, masters, and manufacturers haye gained their 
proficiency in technical schools; though the instruction may not in every 
case have been directly for the benefit of each man’s occupation, it has 
proved to be so indirectly. 
Nothing will be more convincing of the great care taken in Germany 
to aid industry than a presentation of the courses of study pursued in 
the Saxon technical schools at Chemnitz. They consist of (1) a high 
school for trade, (2) a builders’ school, (3) a school for master work- 
men, (4) a school for millers, (5) for dyers, (6) for soap makers, and 
(7) a School of mechanical drawing. 
The courses following here are reported by United States Consul

No. 517, volume 43, of Consular Reports, issued by the State Depart- 
ment. They are here reproduced to corroborate the statements made 
in the foregoing article. 
For the school year 1891-92 there were enrolled 1,169 students in the 
seven departments of the Chemnitz school, as follows:

Of the 1,084 students in this institution, 694 were natives of Saxony, 
310 of other parts of Germany, and 80 foreigners, of whom 6 were 
Americans. The tuition of 63 students, amounting to 3,360 marks, was 
remitted during the year through various scholarships endowed by 
individuals and aid received from the Saxon Government. The ex- 
penditures were as follows: For the increasing of the collections in 
mineralogy, chemistry, etc., 4,073.55 marks ($969.61); for the library, 
6,870.60 marks ($1,635); for school supplies, 36.59 marks ($8.80). 
‘ The library contains 17,070 bound volumes, 1,743 atlases, 4,727 
pamphlets, 453 maps, and 60,278 patent manuscripts. During the year 
1891 there were loaned 7,450 volumes, as follows: To 47 teachers, 1,923; 
to 1,006 students, 5,013; to others, 2,960; also, 995 patent records were 
consulted. 
1. Roya HigHER TrapEs SCHOOL. 
This school offers to those intending to devote themselves to one of the departments 
given below the means of obtaining, through carefully planned instruction and suit- 
able practical application, the necessary scientific preparation appropriate for each. 
A.—Mechanical technology; for those intending to become manufacturers, super- 
intendents (Directoren), or mechanical experts (Techniker) in the different depart- 
ments of mechanical technology (machine building, spinning and weaving, etc.). 
B.—Chemical technology; for intending manufacturers, superintendents, experts, 
etc., in the different chemical trades and manufacturing departments. 
C.—Building; for architects. The instruction in this department is not parallel 
with that given in the building school, from which it differs in having a broader 
scope and the plan of instruction differently arranged. 
D.—Electrical technology; for manufacturers, engineers, and experts in electric 
apparatus. 
Each of these departments has three courses, of which the first requires three terms 
(Halbjahre) and the second two. The third course in the mechanical, chemical, and 
electrical departments requires two terms and in the building department only one, 
In studies which are the samo in all four departments instruction is given to all the 
students together when practicable. Instruction begins in the first course of Depart- 
ments A, B, and E in the first week after Easter; in the first of the building depart- 
ment, as well as the second and third courses in all three divisions, the first week in 
October.
-P-A-G-E-417
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 359 
The students in the first course in the building department have, after their first 
term, a summer term of practical work in the business. Entranco into this school, 
except in special cases, must be at the beginning of the course. Candidates must be 
at least 15 years old, must be vaccinated, must possess the necessary preliminary 
Knowledge, and, in cases of minors, must have the consent of the father or guardian. 
In the case of those entering the first course of the building department, at least half 
a year must have been spent in practical building work. For scholars in Depart- 
ment A from one to two years’ experience in 2 machine shop of small or medium size 
is recommended, and for scholars in Division E, such a course in a machine shop or 
in electrical works. 
At the beginning of the first course students are admitted without examination who 
have certificates showing that they have completed the course in a Gymnasium or Real- 
Gymnasium for entrance into the Obersekunda or in a Real-Sehule and have a mark 
of over 3 (geniigend) in German and mathematics. Those are also admitted without 
examinations who have successfully completed a year or more in the Obersekunda of 
a Gymnasium ora Real-Gymnasium. All those candidates for admission who have 
not already passed their preliminary scientific examinations for veluntary military 
service, or refer to it only before the examining committee, are subject to examina- 
tion. To these examinations candidates can also be admitted who have completed 
their course for the Obersekunda or in the Real-Schule, but whose mark was not 
above 3 (geniigend) in German and mathematics, or who have not entered a higher 
class in the Real-Gymnasium or Gymnasium than Untersekunda. 
For admission, these must also bring certificates showing the mark attained in each 
case. On account of lack of space, those who have attained a higher practical expe- 
rience may be advanced in proportion upon their entrance. The entrance examina- 
tions include German, mathematics, geography, and French. Tho requirements are: 
In German, accuracy in spelling and in elementary grammar and ability to preparo 
compositions; in mathematics, knowledge of algebra and simple equations and plane 
geometry; in geography, knowledge of the most essential parts of physical and polit- 
ical geography; in French, principal rules of construction and syntax. 
For entrance into a higher course after it is begun, the additional knowledge of 
what has already been gone over by the class is required. Those who enter the sec- 
ond or third term of the first course or a higher one in the building division must 
have had two terms of practical experience. For special examinations for entrance 
in higher course or for other cause, an extra charge of 10 marks ($2.38) is made. The 
admission is final (endgiltig) when the applicant has fully complied with these con- 
ditions. It is conditional (bedingt) if the examination shows an incomplete prepa- 
ration, but a prospect of its being made up. The conditional entrance becomes final 
if no further cause of delay appears on the mark attained at the end of the first term. 
Application for admission is to be made to the board of directors, either orally or 
in writing, for the Easter term, not later than Palm Sunday; for the fall term, not 
later than September 15. The condition as given above must be complied with by 
bringing the officially sealed or stamped certificate of birth, the certificate of vacci- 
nation, and all the school testimonials, together with the written consent of the 
father or guardian. Those who have had practical experienco must present testi- 
monials as to all their work and their progress, and must state which department 
they wish to enter and whether they have already had one term (Department C, 
second term). 
All these certificates and testimonials must be presented at least a week before the 
examinations, All students aro alike subject to the rules of the school, and in rela- 
tion to attendance, behavior, and preparation of required work aro subject to the 
oversight of the board of directors and the instructors. 
At Michaelmas and Easter a report of the standing and deportment of each student 
is sent to parents or guardians. Only those students who have attained in all 
branches at least the mark 3 are allowed to advance to the next higher course; nor 
are students allowed to go on to the work of any term unless the same mark (3—

geniigend) has been attained for the work of the previous term. Any student who 
has taken the work of the same course or term twice without attaining the necessary 
average must leave theschool. Any student leaving the school before the completion 
of the full courso may havo a certificate showing progress made and the length of 
time spent in the school. 
Students who have completed the third course, having a mark of at least ‘ passed” 
(geniigend) in all the studies of the last term and having an average mark of “ fairly 
good” (ziemlich gut) for the last three terms, receive a diploma (Absolutorial-Zeug- 
niss); but, if they have fulfilled only the first and second conditions, they receive 
only a testimonial (Abgangszeugniss) giving a summary of the several term marks. 
Those who have received a diploma and who wish to continue their studies in a higher’ 
school, instead of devoting themselves to immediate practice, are admitted without 
examination as undergraduates (Studirende), as distinguished from listeners 
(Horern) or special students (Hospitanten), to the Royal Technical High School at 
Dresden, and the Royal Bergakademie, and will also be admitted to all examinations 
in the Dresden High School, except that for the higher public service in the building 
department. 3 
Persons who are of age may be allowed by the director, with the consent of the 
teachers concerned, to attend particular lectures and practical work. They are con- 
sidered Hospitanten, are not subject to the rules of the school, and may obtaina 
certificate showing that they have received such instructions, and forhowlong. This 
permission may be revoked at any time for sufficient cause. 
The tuition fee is 60 marks ($14.28) per term for Germans and 120 marks ($28.56) 
for others, payable in advance at Easter and Michaelmas. German Hospitanten and 
students in single studies pay 5 marks ($1.19) for each hour of instruction per week 
up to 60 marks ($14.28) per twelve or more hours, and others pay twice as much. 
Tuition once paid will under no circumstances be returned. Indigent and worthy 
students who are natives of Saxony and have attended the school at least one term 
may have the tuition remitted. The instituto possesses a number of fixed scholar- 
ships for assisting students. Applicants for remission of tuition or scholarships 
must present in writing to the board of directors (under the rule of the royal minis- 
ter of the interior of 1850) suitable testimonials as to their need. Tho expenses for 
books, writing and drawing materials, etc., average 40 to 50 marks ($9.52 to $11.90) 
a year. 
The directors refer students to families where they may obtain board and lodging, 
for which the expense varies from 600 to 1,000 marks ($142.28 to $238) a year.

included in the course of the Gewerbzcichnenschule (school of mechanical drawing). 
The course in the Gewerbschule includes many branches also taken up in the other 
schools of the Staatslehranstalten, but the instruction is adapted to a different class 
of students, being more general and theoretical and broader in its scope, since the 
other schools take only so much of any science as applies to the special branch of 
technique studied in that department. The purpose of the schools of dyeing. build- 
ing, etc., is to fit the students for skilled work in the trade, while the Gewerbschule 
aims to produce experts in the various departments of technology. There were 337 
students enrolled in 1891, of whom 163 were natives of Saxony, 139 natives of other 
parts of Germany, and 35 foreigners, divided as follows: Austria, 5; Italy, 2; England,

  3. Scnoon FoR MasTER WORKMEN. 
This school has three departments—A, C, and D—of which A and C (mechanical 
technique) offer to those intending to become machine builders, masters, and super- 
intendents in machine factories, spinning or weaving establishments, or paper facto- 
ries, and to millwrights, well contractors, etc., an opportunity to acquire the 
necessary theoretical preparation; and department D (electro-technique) offers the 
same to overseers of electric piants. 
The course in mechanical technique (Departments A and C) covers three terms 
(Halbjahre). Department D has, besides, a fourth term devoted exclusively to electro- 
technique. In this comparatively brief space of time the students can acquire only 
the knowledge and practice essential for their special department of work. It is not 
the purpose of this school to give a comprehensive scientific education. 
Departments A and C begin at Easter and at Michaelmas of each year; Depart- 
ment D begins its special instruction only at Michaelmas. Entrance to this school 
is subject to the following conditions: Candidates must be at least 17 years old and 
vaccinated, must have the necessary preparation, and must have at least three 
years’ experience in their trade; minors must have the consent of parents or 
guardians. 
For intending machine builders, work in an ordinary blacksmith’s shop or in the 
drawing department of a machine shop will be counted, but it is urgently recom- 
mended that the preparatory work be in a machine shop of middle size. For electri- 
cians practice in a mechanical workshop, in telegraph building, or electro-technical 
factory will servo as preparation. 
Those entering must at least readily write, compose in simple German, and be able 
to perform easy calculations, both with common and decimal fractions. In these 
branches an examination is held shortly before the beginning of the term. For 
entrance into a higher class is required, in addition, knowledge and practice equiva- 
lent to that gained by the rest of the students in that class. For such entrance a 
further examination is required, which is free if taken at the time of the other exam- 
inations, but costs 5 marks if taken after the term has begun. 
Application for admission must be made to the board of directors of the Tech- 
nische Staatslehranstalten, orally or in writing, for the Easter term not later than 
Palm Sunday; for the Michaelmas term not later than September 15. At least a 
week before the examinations for entrance the following must be presented: The 
officially sealed or stamped birth certificate, vaccination certificate, school certifi-
-P-A-G-E-432
3874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
cates, and certificates of all practical experience. Minors must have the written 
permission of parents or guardians. 
All students are alike subject to the laws of the school and are responsible to the 
director for deportment and for preparation of assigned work. At Easter and 
Michaelmas a report of standing and deportment is sent to parents or guardians. A 
mark of less than 3 excludes from passing to the next higher class. Any student 
failing twice to pass must leave the school. Students leaving before the completion 
of the course receive a testimonial showing how long they have been members of the 
school, their deportment and their progress. 
The tuition fee is 30 marks for each term, payable in advance at Easter and 
Michaelmas. Tuition paid is under no circumstances returned. Indigent and 
worthy students who have attended the school at least one term may, in special 
eases, be aided through scholarships for that purpose, and the tuition may also be 
remitted. Applicants for remission of tuition or aid must produce testimonials of 
their need to the board of directors before the beginning of the term. The expense 
for books, writing and drawing materials, ete., is about 30 marks a year. The 
directors will advise the students of families where they can obtain board and 
lodging, of which the necessary cost is from 600 to 800 marks a year. 
Students at the Werkmeisterschule are as a rule excused from military service 
during the course upon application to the proper authorities. With this school are 
united the Fiirberschule and the Fachschule fiir Seifensieder. The courses in these 
latter schools begin only at Michaelmas of each year.

This school, as its name implies, is devoted exclusively to weaving in all its 
branches. It was founded in 1857. In 1886 there were 61 students, of whom 39 were 
from Germany (16 from Saxony), 13 from Austria, 1 from Italy, 6 from Russia, 1 from 
Denmark, and 1 from the United States. In 1891 there were 60 students, of whom 
43 were from Germany (27 from Saxony), 9 from Austria, and 8 from Russia. 
There are three scholarships which pay all fees for the holders, and one fund by 
which tuition may be partially remitted for indigent and worthy students. The 
tuition is: For Germans, 270 marks; for others, 450 marks; and a charge of 30 marks 
is made for yarn, patterns, etc. Prizes are given for progress and good behavior. 
The school provides for the use of the students 43 handlooms and 16 machine looms, 
with the necessary preparatory looms and machinery. There is also a collection of 
spinning and weaving materials and a number of books of drawing patterns, besides 
alibrary of works and magazines on weaving. In 1891 the school was visited and 
the course of instruction studied by a large deputation from Manchester, England, 
and by a deputation from the Labor Bureau at Washington. 
The course covers one year and is divided into two terms, one beginning at Easter 
and the other at Michaelmas. 
The course of study is as follows: 
FIRST TERM. 
(1) Leetures on weaving materials and on the construction and system of the dif- 
ferent handlooms and supplementary weaving tools (four hours per week).

IV.—RURAL OR UNGRADED SCHOOLS IN GERMANY. 
INTRODUCTION. 
» The animated and timely discussion of the question of improving the 
ungraded schools of this country suggests an inspection of such schools 
in Germany. It was publicly asserted in The Forum (October, 1895) 
that— 
The American farmer of two generations ago was a better educated man than is 
the American farmer of to-day. No one would ever have thought of calling hima 
peasant. He did not suggest such a thing in his manner of life, poor though it was; 
nor yet in his manner of thinking, though that may have been narrow. Let any 
candid observer go into a neighborhood where the land has been tilled by the same 
family for generations and let him find a farm where there are still three generations 
upon it. He is almost sure to find that those of the oldest generations can speak, 
write, and think with more accuracy than the second generation, and that the second 
generation will show more evidences of education than the third. This shows 
degeneration, and this degeneration can be directly traced to the decadence of the 
country public schools, which now are really beneath discussion, were there not a 
hope that by telling of their badness some interest might be excited, and that through 
this interest they might be improved. ; 
This assertion by John Gilmer Speed is by no means an isolated one. 
The National Educational Association has recognized the necessity of
-P-A-G-E-439
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 381 
doing something to improve the rural school, and appointed a commit- 
tee of twelve to prepare a report on the subject. 
People who are acquainted with rural schools in Germany know that 
the difference in results between the urban and the rural elementary is 
not great. In the western parts of the Empire it is scarcely noticea- 
ble, because both kinds of schools virtually follow the same course of 
study prescribed by the Government, and the teachers of city and rural 
schools virtually receive the same professional training. Graduates of 
normal schools (so it was decreed recently in Prussia) are preferably 
employed in cities first, where, under the leadership of experienced 
principals and school inspectors, they may gain experience before they 
are placed in responsible positions in village schools. Thus it is seen 
that the Government considers the rural schools of equal, if not greater, 
value than the city schools. 
THE RURAL SCHOOL IN GERMANY. 
In order to present the scope and work of rural schools in Germany, 
the substance of an article by Mr. F. Hollkamm, a German teacher, is 
here inserted, which was prepared for Rein’s Encyclopaedisches Hand- 
buch der Paedagogik.! 
(1) Definition—The term “ungraded schools” means those institu- 
tions in which all children of school age of a school district are seated 
in one schoolroom and are taught by one teacher. 
(2) Name.—This kind of school is variously named: “Gesamtschule” 
in Switzerland, ‘‘one-teacher school” in Bavaria, ‘“one-class school” 
in Prussia, “ungraded school” in United States. 
(3) Varieties.—These names indicate the two chief varieties of rural 
schools. In Switzerland and the United States all the pupils are 
  
  1It is explicitly stated here that the use of the monitorial system described in this 
article is nowhere in Germany required by governmental decree, but it is the result 
of circumstances and custom. If a teacher is placed face to face with the task of 
teaching and disciplining 80 or more children he of necessity resorts to the make- 
shift of calling in the help of his older pupils. Ever since the inauguration of the 
system of compulsory education the rural teachers in Prussia have resorted to the 
employment of monitors, and in the following article it is shown how systematically 
and successfully it can be done, 
It is also desirable to state that no pedagogical idea has aided the work in rural 
schools more than the idea of concentration as advanced by the disciples of Herbart. 
It is safe to say that rural school-teachers in Germany generally follow some system 
of correlating the branches of study by grouping them as well as their classes. As 
no governmental decree prescribes the method of instruction to be followed, the 
popularity of Herbart’s pedagogy among the elementary school-teachers in Germany 
is very extended. The author of the article quoted in this chapter, Mr. F. Holl- 
kamm, presents the features of German rural schools customary in many places. 
This is stated so as to leave no chance for any misunderstanding which might arise 
from the supposition that this article was an official report. The Encyclopedia of 
Professor Rein, for which Mr. Hollkamm furnished his article, is a most authorita- 
tive work of very recent origin. ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-440
  382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
present at all hours of the daily school session; in Bavaria, Prussia, 
and other German States the whole bulk of the pupils are together in 
one room only through a few lessons, while during a partof the day the 
advanced pupils are taught alone. In some parts of Germany the 
teacher devotes half the day to the primary and the other half to 
the advaneed classes. Wherever such a separation of pupils into 
elasses takes place the school is, strictly speaking, not an ungraded or 
one-class school any longer, for the use of the same room and the 
employment of the same teacher for both sections are unessential char- 
acteristics of the technical term “class.” In this case the school is 
graded into a lower and upper grade, although taught by one teacher. 
(4) Deficiencies and advantages.—It is obvious that the ungraded 
school, being the simplest and most incomplete form of school, must 
show many deficiencies. Since it is impossible to teach simultaneously 
the pupils of seven or eight yearly grades attending the school, they 
must be divided into sections, of which one is taught at a time, while 
the others are kept busy with written work or study of text-books. 
This seriously endangers the discipline, because pupils who have little 
inducement to work by themselves, and think themselves unobserved, 
tend toward infraction of the rules, and also because the simultaneous 
work of several grades in the same room is apt to divert the attention 
and lead to disorder. Instruction and learning under sueh cireum- 
stances can not be all-absorbing. Constant and unavoidable noise 
caused by slate work and movements made by active children disturb 
the lesson of the class just then reciting. The time given to each sec- 
tion is necessarily divided into fractions. According to the number 
of sections, ‘lesson hours” shrink to half hours, thirds, or quarters, and 
the time lost in changing classes and assigning lessons is considerable. 
Likewise the teacher’s force is frittered away, especially if we consider 
the time it takes for the preparation of each day’s work and for correet- 
ing pupils’ written work after school hours. While the teacher hears 
lessons he must-have his eye on the other sections engaged in work in 
their seats. If the time is short the work assigned has to be carefully 
measured off, so as to afford oceupation without calling for undue strain. 
The teacher must hear all his classes or sections every day, and most 
of them two or three times. This leaves him not a minute of rest from 
the arduous duties of oral teaching. 
Despite this dividing the time and the teacher’s strength the pupil’s 
individuality can not be cared. for sufficiently. The differences of the 
pupils’ individualities are greater than in other schools, since the rural 
school is attended by children of all ages (between 6 and 14), by all 
social strata, and by both sexes. The grading within the rural school 
can not be continued sufficiently to do justice to the difference in age, 
not to speak of other considerations, such as arise from the pupils’ sex. 
Hence there becomes necessary during the actual lessons a high moral 
pressure which diminishes the interest. The more sections or classes
-P-A-G-E-441
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EYROPE. 383 
a teacher makes the less pressure is felt by each pupil; but in the same 
proportion in which this pressure is lessened the frittering away of time 
and strength increases. The reverse takes place if the number of 
classes is decreased. Injury to the instruction is unavoidable in either 
“case. 
* These deficiencies or defects are offset by great advantages which 
may be traced back to three chief factors: First the family-like char- 
acter of such a school; second, the facilities for intimate intercourse 
between teacher and community (or school and home), and third, the 
unity of the educational institution, which affords the rural teacher 
(who, as a rule, in Germany is a permanent officer) opportunity to watch 
the development of his pupils from infancy to maturity. 
The first cause gives the teacher opportunities to influence one pupil 
by another; hence, both in regard to intellectual work and in the 
upbuilding of character, he is enabled to stimulate the individuality 
of his pupils and employ methods of procedure which resemble the 
mutual influence exercised by the members of a family upon one 
another. 
The second cause enables him to influence the parents in behalf of 
their children. If the teacher enjoys the confidence of the parental 
home, he will not find it difficult to work toward better home training 
of his pupils and to aid the parents in the supervision of home work 
and in rendering assistance to weak pupils. 
The best feature of the unclassified school, however, is its unity. 
This gives the teacher a liberty of movement and action which no 
teacher in graded schools can enjoy. To remove inconveniences, to 
institute improvements, etc., is possible to the teacher of the ungraded 
schoo!, while the teacher of the graded school has to consult other 
teachers, the principal, and perhaps higher authorities besides, before 
he can make any changes. If, for instance, the progress made in one 
branch seems inadequate, the teacher, “who is master of all he sur- 
veys” and shares his authority with no one, can equalize the difference 
by giving more attention and time to that branch. He can aid a 
talented child to do justice to its natural gifts, and can help slow pupils 
to progress more quickly. He can exereise an influence upon his pupils 
for eight years. During such along period the individuality of a child 
can be studied and impressed, and bad tendencies can be counteracted. 
better than in schools where a teacher has his pupils just one year and 
then hands them over to another teacher. Instruction and ethical 
training both gain in intensity in a school in which the teacher acts in 
the role of father and mother for eight years. It is a weighty argu- 
ment to know that the execution of the entire educational plan lies in 
the hand of him who planned it. Pedagogical demands, with refer- 
ence to preparation, apperception, and concentration, can be heeded 
without difficulty. In regard to training, it is worth considering that 
the pupil accustoms himself, during a period of eight years, to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-442
  384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
peculiarities of his teacher, and not having opportunities to compare 
him with others he does not easily discover his weaknesses. Finally, the 
unity of the entire educational apparatus represented in the ungraded 
school causes in the teacher a feeling of increased responsibility. He 
himself reaps the fruit of well-performed labor, and for want of success 
he can not make others responsible. 
Some advantages of more external character are derived from the 
division of the school into sections. The latter coincide with the grades 
of a city school, but their number of pupils is much smaller. Hence the 
individual pupils are strained, and their attention is taxed more in a brief 
period of time each day than the pupils of a graded school. A quarter 
of an hour devoted to 10 or 12 pupils may secure as great a result as a 
whole hour devoted to 70 pupils. At least there is no reason to think 
that the difference will be very great. 
In weighing the advantages and disadvantages of an ungraded school 
two things should be considered: First, real defects exist side by side 
with undoubted excellencies. The latter must be utilized; the former 
can only be palliated, but not entirely removed. How to do this depends 
upon the personality of the teacher. On the other hand, the very 
defects of the schools are a constant check to all kinds of extravagancies 
in the teacher’s methods. They oblige the teacher to prepare himself 
thoroughly, to be brief in his explanations, to restrict himself to that 
which is most necessary and essential in the selection of matter, and to 
give a broad margin to exercises and the practice of the matter learned. 
Self-activity on the part of the pupil is the necessary presupposition 
for the success of the ungraded school. That through its imperfections 
it obliges the teacher to foster self-activity in the pupil is one of the 
best features of this school. 
(5) Organization.—In organizing an ungraded school the first thing to 
be done is the division of the pupils into sections; the next, to properly 
select pupil-teachers or “helpers” from among the most advanced and 
reliable pupils, and third, to institute a system of occupations for all 
sections that are not reciting to the teacher or to a helper. 
(a) In dividing the whole school into sections several things have to 
be considered. If the individuality of the children is to be properly 
regarded, if a large amount of matter is to be thoroughly worked 
over, many divisions or sections are needed; the least number would 
be seven or eight. If, however, the frittering of time and strength 
is thought of, and skill and circumspection wanted in keeping ocecu- 
pied all sections not under immediate supervision; if the disturb- 
ances arising from frequent changes of classes and occupations are 
dreaded, it would seem as though two or three sections were prefer- 
able. Hence the following compromise between the different consid- 
erations may be recommended: The differences in natural gifts are, as 
experience teaches, greatest during the first year of school; besides, 
the “road to learning” is narrow in the beginning, and progress rapid;  
-P-A-G-E-443
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 385 
hence the first-year pupils should form one class. During the next few 
years an equalization takes place between the differences in individu- 
ality; the “road” and the horizon widen, and progress is slower; 
reviews are here easy, hence two yearly classes may be combined with- 
out detriment to the pupils. In schools of an eight-year course the 
pupils of the last three years might safely be combined into one section. 
This would give the following combination: 
First year = Class or Section I. 
Second and third years = Class or Section II. 
Fourth and fifth years = Class or Section III. 
Sixth, seventh, and eighth years = Class or Section IV. 
This combination is permanent, and holds good for all the branches. 
Only in singing, and possibly in other minor branches, the whole school 
or several classes may be thrown together. In assigning work to be 
done by the pupils in their seats, it must be arranged so as to increase 
both the difficulties and the amount of work as the class advances in 
years. 
(b) The employment of pupils for the purpose of aiding the teacher 
in keeping order and supervising the work is called the monitorial sys- 
tem. Pupils who help to keep order in school and on the playground 
are simply monitors. If they are called upon to aid other pupils in 
their work, or hear them recite, they are pupil-teachers. These are 
sometimes assigned to aid individual pupils in seat work in which they 
find particular difficulties—in that case they are silent helpers; or they 
may at times be assigned to hear an entire class of not more than ten 
pupils recite—in that case they act as teachers. They may hear a class 
in spelling or reading, or recite memorized poems; they may narrate 
stories for composition exercises, review lessons heard from the teacher 
himself, dictate sentences or words, and conduct lessons in penmanship. 
In short, they may be employed as assistants in various branches and 
occupations, Monitors may be used in graded schools also, but pupil- 
teachers are a specialty of ungraded schools. 
“The propriety of employing pupil-teachers has often been doubted. 
It has been said, pupils are incapable of giving instruction. They 
disturb with their work the repose of the schoolroom and enter as con- 
fusing elements in the personal intercourse between teacher and pupils. 
The latter objection holds good only if, as was done ia the Bell-Lancas- 
ter schools, the system of pupil-teachers is unduly extended, so that the 
teacher becomes a mere overseer of a knowledge shop. It is true, 
pupils are not capable of giving instruction according to educational 
principles, since they lack the requisite knowledge of psychology and 
pedagogy. But instruction implies a variety of work for the purpose 
of practice, for which merely a steadfast adherence to duty is needed. 
This refers chiefly to written exercises, reviews, and application of things 
learned during lessons. The weightiest consideration is the noise and 
ED 95. 13  
-P-A-G-E-444
386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
eommotion caused by the pupil-teachers. This will lead to a restriction 
of the system in small, inconvenient rooms; but in spacious school- 
rooms, especially schools that are provided with vestibules, anterooms, 
and cloakrooms, the system of pupil-teachers may be employed to 
advantage. 
The desirability of employing pupil-teachers! arises from the neces- 
sity of shortening the time of silent study or written work. If the 
school is divided into four sections the teacher can devote only fifteen 
minutes per hour to each section; hence each section has forty-five 
minutes per hour for work in their seats. If pupil-teachers are 
employed this period of forty-five minutes may properly be abbrevi- 
ated to thirty minutes, besides making the pupils perform more work— 
that is, employ their time more profitably. The exercise or application 
of matters learned during oral lessons with the teacher becomes more 
thorough, hence self-activity on the part of the pupils is promoted by 
the silent occupation following. Above all, employing pupil-teachers 
affords all the pupils better opportunities to use their tongues. It is 
torture for a child to keep silent for three-quarters of an hour, and it 
may injure the development of his conimand of language. 
Pupil-teachers are not to be employed indiscriminately. In impor- 
tant branches, where facts are transmitted and emotions are awakened, 
like religion, natural history and natural science, geography and his- 
tory, the work of the teacher will have to be very prominent, while in 
other branches where skill of performance is the main point, like read- 
ing, grammar, spelling, penmanship, and drawing, as well as arithmetic 
(especially written), the pupil-teacher can serve most acceptably. 
Monitors for keeping order may be taken from any section except 
the lowest. Pupil-teachers must invariably be taken from the most 
advanced section. In order not to retard the progress of any pupil- 
teacher in his own work, it must be the rule never to assign a pupil to 
teachers’ duties while his own class is reciting to the teacher or receiv- 
ing instruction from him. The benefits accruing from duties as pupil- 
teachers are very material. They are chiefly found in the review of the * 
pupil’s own knowledge. The time they lose from that devoted to silent 
work is fully made up by the thoroughness these reviews secure; more- 
over, a sensible teacher will choose the most talented of his advanced 
pupils, who rarely need as much time for silent work as the average 
pupils. 
In order to make the system successful, it is imperative to give the 
pupil-teachers special instructions as to how to proeeed. If this claims 
more time than brief orders will take, it is well to call them to the 
teacher’s desk during recess, or before and after the daily sessions, and 
give them specific instructions. Even written preparation is advisable

instruction, often called the Bell-Lancaster system, is appended at the close of this 
article. They are translated from the German.

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 387 
by using “class journals” and “ question books,” which contain notes 
as to the order of procedure and leading questions concerning the 
matter to be gone over. These questions (together with the answers) 
should be carefully gone over with the pupil-teachers, so as to enable 
them to conduct miniature recitations. The questions consist of main 
and subordinate questions, which may be designated as such by mar- 
ginal notes or marks. The tasks assigned to the pupil-teachers are to 
be frequently changed, lest they result in parrot-like repetition. There 
are several models of question books for pupil-teachers published in 
Germany, of which Dérpfeld’s are considered the best. 
(c) The silent occupations (seat work) may be written or mental. 
We class among the first: Copying, writing from memory, composition 
and other language work, correction of written work, map drawing, 
drawing of sketches in connection with nature study and geography, 
other drawing work, penmanship, writing music, and work in arithme- 
tic. Mental occupation may consist of reading, recalling narrations, 
search in dictionary, map reading, reading of music, and memorizing 
poems or other matter. Both occupations have their merits and 
demerits. The written work, is easier to control, but causes more noise 
than exclusively mental work which requires a high degree of skill in 
reading if it is to be performed in absolute quietude. Mental work is 
not easily gauged by results. 
The two kinds of occupation are to be carefully prepared, both by 
the teacher during his lessons, and the pupil-teacher after school hours. 
They must be adapted to the capacity of the pupil. The teacher is 
obliged to consider the combination in class of pupils of two yearly 
courses; that is, require increased work of the elder section of that 
class. At times he will present particular difficulties to the most tal- 
ented of his pupils, and ease the work of weaker ones. Best adapted 
for pupil-teachers’ work are exercises that require no lengthy explana- 
tions and may be extended or broken off at will, as for instance written 
number work. It is at all times imperative to leave no work unin- 
spected. If much more time is needed for inspection of the written 
work than can be spared from the teacher’s lessons, he must do it after 
school hours or during recess. Frequently an immediate inspection is 
necessary and can be performed by a pupil-teacher, but great care is 
required in the selection of that particular pupil in order to prevent 
deception. As far as possible the written work should be facilitated 
by preventing errors, rather than correcting errors after they are made. 
To look over the pupils’ written work carefully means the loss of much 
of the teacher’s valuable time, yet, if he leave this work undone, he 
would cause injury by this omission. 
If at times no chance is offered a class for silent occupation or other 
wotk, it would seem preferable to dismiss that class. This case often 
happens with the primer class shortly after their admission to school. 
It may be well at times to allow a class to listen to the recitation of
-P-A-G-E-446
388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
another, instead of giving them work to do; for instance, during recita- 
tions of poems and narrations, reading of composition, etc., other classes 
may listen. In a few cases the teacher may occupy two sections simul- 
taneously. He may hear one class in grammar and dictate words for 
spelling to another. Lessons in mental arithmetic may be carried on 
with two sections. However, such double work is rather objectionable, 
owing to its difficulty. A commendable method of abbreviating the 
time for silent work consists in calling for aid upon a next higher class 
to present new matter to the lower. This takes a burden from the 
teacher and offers opportunity to the pupil for a thorough review of 
some particular point. Of course the most radical means for the abbre- 
viation of the time for silent work is the diminution of the number of 
sections, but since that can not be well done owing to reasons advanced 
before, the teacher may vary the number of sections according to the 
branch under treatment; for instance, in reading not so many sections 
are needed as in arithmetic. However, such variations must be left 
entirely to the good judgment of the teacher, who must needs be 
professionally prepared. 
(6) Course of study.—Making a course of study for an ungraded 
school involves two chief considerations, selection and order of branches. 
‘With reference to the selection—that is, “The what and the how much” 
of any subject prescribed—few suggestions can be made. With refer- 
ence to the order in which the branches are to be taken up, the ques- 
tion arises, “What modifications of the pedagogical demands for the 
arrangement of matter are needed in order to do justice to the peculiar 
conditions of the ungraded school?” . In the further discussion of this 
question a sketch of a course of. study may show the practical execu- 
tion of proposed plans. 
(a) Since the ungraded school, like all other educational institutions, 
is to generate many-sided interest, it follows that the course of study 
must be relatively complete. A complete course of study will contain 
the branches representing nature-study as well as culture-studies. It 
will never be profitable to cut out such branches as history, natural 
history, and geography, and restrict the work to religion, language, 
arithmetic, and singing, in order to gain time. The same demand for 
many-sided interest will call for the insertion of art instruction; hence 
drawing and music must be included. Sufficient time must be devoted 
to literature, by treating poems and prose pieces not merely from a 
grammatical, but from a literary standpoint. Again, in the unclas- 
sified and in all other educational institutions, the object of which is 
to educate and train, and not merely to transmit knowledge, a con- 
sideration for the individuality and the environment of the pupil will 
have its effect upon the selection of matter. The fact that children of 
the ungraded rural school are in more intimate connection with nature 
and its phenomena than city children will have weight in the selection 
of subjects for nature-study. Again, the fact that in the greater number
-P-A-G-E-447
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 389 
of rural communities dialects are spoken instead of high German, calls’ 
for special attention to language studies. Arithmetic and geometry, 
penmanship and gymnastics, can of necessity not be omitted from 
the studies of the ungraded school. 
(b) When considering the amount of matter selected the teacher has 
to guard himself from going to extremes. If he selects too much, he is 
apt to treat all subjects superficially, owing to the want of time devoted 
to lessons and recitations conducted by himself; nor can he thoroughly 
ingraft facts upon the minds of his pupils. Interest can arise only 
from firmly rooted and well grouped concepts. On the other hand, if 
the amount of matter is very much restricted it will not generate an 
interest, because a certain number of concepts are needed for that 
purpose. Interest will be weak where it is not fed by a wealth of con- 
cepts. In order to avoid the dangers of both extremes, the course 
of study must contain some matter from all the branches mentioned. 
Three methods for maintaining the pupils’ many-sided interest may be 
mentioned: First, the amount of matter in the various branches may 
be diminished according to their importance, but not at the beginning, 
when the principles and fundamental facts are presented, but rather 
higher in the course. Second, by prudent arrangement of lessons 
and intimate correlation of matter time and strength may be saved. 
Finally, in every branch of the course the points which are of typical 
importance, and hence may serve as centers for less important matters, 
should be treated thoroughly and practiced more frequently. For 
instance, in arithmetic it is vital to let the pupils understand that 
“5 per cent” is acommon fraction and means one-twentieth. Exercises 
that will make this clear beyond doubt are more necessary than all the 
many “cases” developed from different conditions or points of view. 
If, in biblical history, the story of Joseph up to his elevation in Egypt 
is treated thoroughly, the journey of the brothers need be only read or 
narrated, In natural history the dog is studied minutely, while wolf 
and fox, representatives of the same class, need less attention. The 
main items of any series of concepts must serve to generate the 
interest; minor matters serve to correlate and establish connection. 
These three methods lead us to special questions concerning the course 
of study. 
(c) The science of pedagogy rejects the formerly customary aggre- 
gate of branches called a course of study and demands a plan which is 
unified and systematically arranged. According to this plan, furnished 
by Ziller and his disciples, the order of the matter taken up is accord- 
ing to steps analogous to the history of culture. This is not the place 
to discuss the relative value of this arrangement. Let it be said that 
Ziller’s plan does more justice to pedagogical demands with regard to 
preparation, apperception, and concentration of instruction than the 
commonly advocated arrangement according to concentric circles. 
The latter arrangement serves the acquisition of knowledge, while the
-P-A-G-E-448
  390 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
former aims at ennobling and training the pupil’s emotion and will as 
well as intellect. 
Since it is obvious at first glance that the complicated plan of Ziller 
in its original form, intended for schools of eight grades, can not be 
applied in the ungraded school, the question arises how it may be 
modified to suit the oceasion. 
In “Gesinnungsunterricht” (influence upon the sentiments and 
heart), the last of the eight groups of Ziller, that referring to the cate- 
chism may be omitted. This group does not represent a special step in 
culture. A systematic connection of the catechism with biblical his- 
tory is easily established and may find its conclusion in the history of 
the Apostles. On the other hand, the ungraded school can not do 
without fairy stories and Robinson Crusoe. This school receives its 
children chiefly from among peasants and the poor farmers, in whose 
homes a true family life is rarely found, owing to the variety of duties 
that both father and mother are obliged to pursue. The result is, that 
the children come to school with very imperfect language and almost 
void of important concepts. Their religious horizon of concepts is 
particularly limited, hence much attention to biblical history during 
the first two school years can not be advised. Narrations of the life 
of Jesus will awaken a religious feeling and primary concepts. Then, 
by means of narrations, such as fairy stories and the adventures of Rob- 
inson Crusoe, the children’s language is improved and their thought 
eoncepts increased. In connection with this work a limited number of 
ethical concepts are awakened. Then may follow a discussion of bibli- 
cal stories in accordance with the given steps of the history of culture. 
First, the time of the Patriarchs; second, the Judges; third, the Kings; 
fourth, the life of Jesus; fifth, the time of the Apostles. The three 
periods of the Old Testament should claim about equal time with the 
two periods of the New Testament. The life of Jesus should at all 
times be the most important part of religious instruction. 
Analogous to the series of concepts awakened in the ‘Gesinnungs- 
unterricht,” the matter in the other branches is to be simplified. In 
history the events of modern times will naturally be treated slightingly. 
During the earlier school years fairy stories and the adventures of 
Robinson Crusoe will replace the historical instruction. For the prep- 
aration of the three periods of German history—namely, the time of 
the kings, the reformation, and modern times—it will be sufficient in 
ungraded schools to touch upon the “ Nibelungensaga,” which may rep- 
resent the heroic time of the nation. The Thuringian stories may be 
omitted and be replaced by home stories, which may be offered in con- 
nection with home geography. For the study of nature the two steps— 
the time of the shepherds and agriculture—should be treated more 
thoroughly. The discussion of the time of hunting may follow in con- 
nection with so-called object lessons preparatory to the study of nature 
and geography. The industrial step and a discussion of technology,
-P-A-G-E-449
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 391) 
Geography should consider the description of home and fatherland as 
well as the continent of Europe; other continents are studied only in 
connection with history. Points which are of importance in connection 
with historical events should be found on the map. In language in- 
struction the teacher should restrict himself to prose pieces of epic 
character and to poems of epic and lyrie contents. The step called 
“dramatic” poetry might be omitted or only touched upon in connec- 
tion with model pieces from the reader. The principle prescribed by 
the Government that grammar and spelling should be limited to suit 
existing local cireumstances is particularly important for ungraded 
schools. Instruction in drawing must, as Menard conclusively proves, 
have an independent field for its choice of matter, but even this matter 
must be arranged according to the history of culture. The ungraded 
school can develop the geometric ornament a little better than conyen- 
tionalized plant forms. Drawing of solids will prove to be impossible 
and may be replaced by the coloring of printed drawings showing per- 
spective. In singing the teacher will find it best to use juvenile songs 
with epic contents; in the upper grades songs with epic and lyric con- 
tents. Hymns are to be taught in every grade. In arithmetic the number 
eycles from one to ten, from ten to one hundred, and from one hundred 
to one thousand should be treated with much thoroughness in the four 
fundamental rules, both with denominate and undenominate numbers, 
while for quantities beyond one thousand numeration and notation 
is all that is necessary. In arithmetic every rule learned should be 
applied to circumstances from daily life. It is not so much skill in 
handling large numbers as it is skill in the manipulation of small num- 
bers and fractions which should be aimed at. Penmanship needs to be 
practiced only in the lower sections; while in sections 1 and 2 the 
German script is practiced, the Latin seript is added in the third sec- 
tion. Though the pupils are to some extent prepared for geometry 
during the lessons'in drawing and mensuration, it is not taken up as a 
separate study until the seventh year of school, and is restricted to the 
simplest geometric bodies. 
(da) The arrangement of the matter of study is determined upon in 
Ziller’s plan according to the idea of concentration. Since this idea is 
excellently adapted to aet as a counterweight in ungraded schools to 
the unavoidable loss of time and strength, it may be applied with ben- ° 
efit for pupil and teacher. This application may take three forms, which 
may be mentioned briefly. First, in the lower sections certain branches 
are grouped together; for instance, knowledge of nature and home is 
connected with the most important branch of language studies, the so- 
called object lessons; likewise with arithmetic. Again, the different 
branches of nature study should consciously be united; for instance, it 
should not be said that zoology, botany, mineralogy, and physiology 
are taught, but the science of nature. In language it should not be
-P-A-G-E-450
  392 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
called literature, composition, grammar, and spelling, but it should at 
all times be called language. Instruction in religion will not suffer a 
division into biblical history, catechism, biblical quotations, hymns, 
and Bible reading. In this, as in all other branches, unity must be 
observed. Third, related branches should be connected and grouped 
around instruction of religion as the central, ruling branch of the whole 
course. 
While the first two points may easily be observed in the ungraded 
school, the last one may cause some difficulty, owing to the fact that 
there are not as many sections as there are steps in the course. The 
“central, ruling position” of instruction in religion is understood to 
mean that from it depends the instruction in history, both with refer- 
ence to the selection and arrangement of matter. Side by side with it 
we find various branches of nature study which in their contents form 
a contrast to the first group, but keep step with the others according 
to the capacity of the pupils and their command of language. These 
three branches—teligion, history, and nature study—in their relation 
to each other represent the religious, ethical, and material side of 
education. Subordinate to these are geography and language, and all 
other studies. 
If the ungraded school could treat in a separate section each group 
of matter in the branches that are intended to ennoble the heart, it 
would not be difficult to correlate history, geography, and nature studies 
with all the remaining branches. After the second year of school such 
a combination is impossible. Having two yearly courses combined in 
one section, it can not at the same time treat two groups of branches 
satisfactorily; for instance, Robinson Crusoe and the Patriarchs, or the 
Judges and the Kings, or the life of Jesus and the history of the Apostles. 
Moreover, the order of the groups can not be changed; the history of 
the Patriarchs should not precede the story of Robinson Crusoe. Neither 
can the amount of matter be restricted so as to give the work of one 
year to a two years’ course. This would cause an unnecessary and 
tiresome repetition for the older children. If promotion were to take 
place every other year, instead of every year, it would presuppose 
admission to school every other year. All these difficulties prevent 
the adoption of the original plan of Ziller. Nothing is left but to 
treat both groups simultaneously, or rather alternately, changing semi- 
annually. 
This holds good not only for the matter to be gone over in the study 
of religion, but also in other branches, notably in history, geography, 
etc. Though the difficulties are great, the idea of concentration need 
not necessarily be abandoned, though some branches need more of a 
genetic than a concentrated treatment. (The author enters into very 
minute details, which may be omitted, owing to the fact that Ziller’s 
plan is by no means heartily approved in Germany, nor extensively 
followed. The autlior is evidently a pronounced adherent of Herbart’s  
-P-A-G-E-451
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 393 
and Ziller’s pedagogy, which has not been generally accepted. The 
author is a very well known and successful rural school-teacher, and it 
is quite obvious that his plan in all its various minute details is the 
result of experience. But the conditions in the rural schools in this 
country are so different that his details, so far as they refer to methods 
of instruction, can not be applied easily.) 
(e) The following sketch of a course of study may indicate how the 
matter of instruction may be distributed over four sections, represent- 
ing eight school years: 
FIRST SECTION.—FIRST SCIIOOL YEAR. 
Ethical and religious matters.—Six biblical stories from the life of Jesus; eight to 
ten of Grimm’s Fairy Stories. 
Object lessons (combined with next higher section),—Objects from the horizon of 
the children, and others illustrating ethical and religious matter. Lessons to be 
enlivened by memorized verses. 
Language.—German script and print, excluding words with accumulations of con- 
sonants. Normal words chosen from matters treated in the foregoing. 
Number work.—The four fundamental rules within the number cycle of 1 to 10. 
Drawing.—Sketches of objects illustrating object lessons and lessons in ethical 
and religious matters. 
Singing (combined with the next section).—A few simple children’s songs and a 
few hymns. 
SECOND SECTION.—SECOND AND THIRD SCHOOL YEARS. 
Ethical and religious matters.—Six to 8 stories from the life of Jesus; 16 chapters 
of Robinson Crusoe; 12 to 14 stories of the time of the Patriarchs; in connection 
with the latter related matters from the catechism and a number of biblical quota- 
tions and verses. 
Object lessons (combined with section 1).—Discussion of natural objects and phe- 
nomena relating. to Ziller’s step of hunting and herding. Geographical treatment 
of tho environs and widening of the horizon. 
Language.—Small prose pieces and poems of ethical contents. Special exercises 
jn the skill of reading; accumulation of consonants mastered, sounding, spelling, 
Latin script; copies of writing from dictation, and similar exercises. The simplest 
facts of etymology and syntax of simple sentences. 
Drawing.—Free-hand drawing, aided by stichmographic devices. 
Penmanship.—The small letters and capitals of German script. 
Arithnetic.—The cycle of numbers from 1 to 100; operations in the fundamental 
rules with denominate and underominate numbers. 
Singing (combined with section 1),—Juvenile songs and a few easy hymns. 
  
THIRD SECTION.—FOURTH AND FIFTH YEARS. 
Ethical and religious matters.—The four gospels; 12 stories from the time of the 
judges; 16 from the time of the Kings. In connection with these matters related 
portions of the catechism. Psalms and hymns to be memorized. Some episodes of 
the Nibelungensaga; 12 to 16 stories from the time of the German Kings up to the 
time of the Reformation. 
Nature studies.—Twenty to 24 subjects from Ziller’s step of agriculture and hor- 
ticulture ; some subjects taken from the woods, and reflections upon the weather and 
change of seasons. 
Geography.—The home province or state, followed by a description of Germany; 
map reading and map drawing. 
ED 95: 13*  
-P-A-G-E-452
  
  394 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Language.—Fifteen or 16 poems and prose picces to be carefully treated and 10 to 
12 compositions to be made annually. The necessary rules of grammar and orthog- 
raphy, including syntax of the compound sentence. 
Number work.—The fundamental rules within the cycle of 1 to 1,000, with denom- 
inate and undenominate numbers. During the latter part of the year notation and 
numeration of numbers beyond 1,000. 
Drawing.—Free-hand, with the aid of given dots. 
Pennanship.—Small and capital letters of Latin script. 
Singing (combined with section 4). 
FOURTH SECTION.—SIXTH, SEVENTH, AND EIGHTH YEARS.   
Ethical and religious mattere.—(a) Religion. During the first term, 20 to 24 stories 
from the life of Jesus; reading of the New Testament, especially the gospels; cate- 
chism in connection with this. Hymns for Advent, Christmas, and Passion Week; 
between Christmas and Easter, 12 stories from the times of the apostles; catechism 
and Bible quotations; appropriate hymns. For opening exercises and on other ocea- 
sions some of the epistles may be read. At all times religious instruction should 
consider the church festivals. (b) History. During the first term 12 stories from 
German history, from Luther to the French revolution. After Christmas, 8 stories 
from modern history, the Napoleonic wars. 
Nature studies.—Twelve subjects from Ziller’s step of trades; 8 to 10 subjects from 
the industrial step. In connection with this, something from physics and chemistry 
interesting and important for rural communities. Six to 8 subjects of physiology, 
and frequent reviews and references to matters gone over before. 
Geography.—Twelve topics from the geography of Germany and other European 
countries; 8 topics from other continents; 4 to 6 topics concerning astronomical 
geography. 
Langwage.—Twenty poems and prose pieces; 12 to 15 compositions annually; the 
simplest rules of style; grammar, including syntax of the complex sentence. Rules 
for orthography. 
Arithmetic.—Conclusion of fractions, decimals and common; percentage and some 
business rules. 
Geometry.—Cubes, rhomboids, pyramids, cylinders, cones, and spheres. Planes, 
angles, and lines are only considered in connection with solids. 
Drawing.—Free-hand drawing without guiding lines or dots. Geometric ornaments 
and the beginning of conventionalizing forms. 
Singing (combined with seetion 3).—Twenty-five to 30 songs and 30 hymns within 
the three years’ course; notation and reading of music; exercises in intervals. 
Gymnastics. —Gymnasties can be carried on with the whole school, three sections 
looking on while one exercises; or games may be conducted with the lower classes, 
while the upper use the apparatus. 
(7) The methods of instruction are the same for ungraded as they are 
for graded schools. They must be based on pedagogical principles 
derived from psychological imperatives as they have been formulated 
in systematic connection in Ziller’s theory of formative steps. Only a 
few remarks need to be made because Ziller’s theory is not the subject 
of discussion. 
Time is wanting in the ungraded school for direct instruction from 
the teacher, moreover, that instruction is divided into half hours and 
quarters. The former fact obliges the teacher to treat only the most 
important matters according to the five steps; less important ones can 
be worked up only on the first two steps. Even with subjects demand- 
ing great care and much time, certain restrictions are absolutely unavoid-
-P-A-G-E-453
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 395 
able. The whole organization of the school admits of no waste of time; 
at no period during the course may the teacher retard his progress. 
He must always have such ends in view which the pupil’s concepts can 
readily reach and securely comprehend. If preceding matters have 
been thoroughly understood and frequently practiced, the first step, 
that of preparation, need not claim much time. The presentation of 
new matter is restricted by the time available. The same is true with 
the third step, and the explanations it requires. ‘The fourth step, asso- 
ciation, will require only afew examples for comparison. The fifth step 
may be represented by one sentence which erystalizes in compact form 
what has been learned. This abbreviation of the mode of procedure is 
unavoidable. The exercises following should under no circumstances 
be too much shortened. It is very desirable that they should have 
reference to the material used to make the instruction objective as 
well as to the thought material. 
The division of personal instruction on the part of the teacher into 
small periods of time makes it necessary to crowd the formative steps 
into each hour of the day. It would be sheer waste of time to begin 
with aim and analysis in one hour and to continue with synthesis in 
another, for during the time between the two lessons the awakened 
concepts will vanish. The preparation must occur in the same hour in 
which the presentation of new matter occurs, and possibly also the 
total result of the oral instruction should be crowded into that lesson. 
During another hour the presentation may be repeated and explana- 
tionsadded. Neither should association be separated from application. 
According to the importance and extent of the methodical unit several 
hours may be needed to do it justice. In a minimum of three hours, 
that is to say lessons, the following distribution may take place: First 
hour, aim, preparation, and presentation; second hour, explanation and 
combination; third hour, repetition, association, and application. In 
a maximum of eight hours the steps may be distributed as follows: 
First hour, aim, preparation, and presentation, part 1; second hour, 
review, presentation of part 1, with amplification; third hour, part 2, 
amplification and review; fourth hour, part 3; fifth hour, part 4; sixth 
hour, systematic review, combination with previously established 
thought centers, and development of the system, or crystallization of 
the result; seventh hour, arranging the new results among previously 
acquired matter; eighth hour, application with thorough review of a 
whole series of results terminating in the one just acquired. 
Now, to carry out the system of formative steps successfully, it is nec- 
essary, also, to take into consideration the home occupations of the pupils. 
Thus the aim may be touched upon during the very first hour so as to 
cause pupils to think ahead. During the time of silent oceupation at 
their desks the pupils may gather material and note it down. Material 
for association and application may be found without the aid of the 
teacher, and all this work may be either in writing or oral. There are
-P-A-G-E-454
  396 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1894-95. 
various ways of aiding the method if the pupils are systematically 
trained in self-active work. No other school will aid self-activity as 
the ungraded school will, for the pupil, when he comes face to face with 
a difficulty, must not go to the teacher for help, because at that time 
the teacher is busy with another class and can not give him an audi- 
ence. Note the difference between this and the graded school, where 
the teacher has only pupils of one grade. The teacher’s aid is at all 
times at hand and readily given. 
(8) Time-table-—In arranging the weekly plan of lessons—that is, a 
time-table—the question of greatest importance is, How many hours of 
work may judiciously be expected of the teacher? 
(a) Overburdening of the teacher is to be avoided. In the ungraded 
school he has not only, like other teachers, to study his professional 
science, pedagogy, and supplementary sciences, but he is also obliged 
to prepare himself carefully for his daily lessons, and must further- 
more perform a number of duties which are unknown to teachers of 
graded schools. He must prepare question books for his pupil-teachers, 
instruct these young assistants orally, plan for silent occupations of 
several classes, and do other things. To this comes the very exhaust- 
ive work in the schoolroom, where almost the only rest for his lungs 
are the minutes which the pupils require to answer his questions. If 
‘under such conditions the teacher’s time would be extended to more 
than thirty hours’ actual school work, it would be the ruin of his health, 
and the freshness for his mind would be irreparably injured. On the 
other hand, there is the consideration of keeping the number of hours 
high enough to enable him to treat every branch of study properly. 
Taking thirty as the maximum of weekly school hours, both sides of 
the question seem to be well considered. 
(b) In dividing the time so as to represent the various branches the 
following general principles should be considered: First, branches 
should be given more time than others if they belong to the group 
designed to awaken ethical consciousness; second, that the special 
nature of each branch should be considered with reference to its 
furtherance by exterior conditions. Thus, for instance, the historic 
branches need more time than the nature studies, because the presen- 
tation of the events need more time than the showing and handling of 
objects. Naturally, subjects that depend upon actual sense perception 
can be taught more quickly than branches such as religion, history, lit- 
erature, and a few others, in which the spoken or printed word is almost 
the exclusive carrier of thought. Again, a well-articulated branch 
needs more time than one of simpler construction. Branches rich with 
apperceiving concepts may be given less time than those in which the 
concepts have to be generated first. JF inally, it should be considered 
whether a branch offers more or less opportunity for silent occupations. 
In the latter case more, in the former less time is needed. For instruc- 
tion in religion all these considerations claim a large number of lessons.
-P-A-G-E-455
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 397 
We have therefore assigned it six lessons a week, of which one hour 
may be taken for the opening or devotional exercises. In some villages 
these are given on Sundays in what we here in America call Sunday 
schools. If this is the case, three to four hours can be assigned to the 
upper and middle grades, while two to three lessons are given to the 
lowest grade. The study of history needs rarely more than two hours 
a week, because it is taught only to the upper grades. Moreover, the 
articulation of that subject is less minute than in religion. Nature 
study needs, owing to its importance, a large number of hours because 
it has numerous subtopics. But since in rural schools the whole cycle 
of life of the children offers advantages for that kind of study, three 
hours per week of systematic study must suffice. Geography may have 
two hours a week. To the five hours given to nature study and geog- 
raphy must be added two hours of object lessons given to the lower 
grades. These lessons are preparatory to both nature study and geog- 
raphy. In all the branches mentioned so far two sharply defined grades 
or sections are understood to exist, except for geometry. Five lessons 
are given to language; that is, the study of the mother tongue. Less 
than that will not suffice; first, because it is supplementary to all the 
branches of the course; second, because systematic instruction in lan- 
guage will wipe out dialectic irregularities in the children’s speech. 
More than five hours for language will not be needed, because all 
instruction is language instruction, and because this branch offers many 
opportunities for silent occupations at the desk. Language instruction, 
properly so called, serves only indirectly the highest aim of education 
(see what the author says under ‘Aims of instruction” in the beginning 
of this article), and may be combined in many ways; for instance, gram- 
mar and spelling, grammar and composition, spelling and copying, ete. 
For drawing and penmanship the former relation has been reversed. 
In arithmetic the customary assignment of four hours, as well as the 
assignment of two hours for singing and gymnastics, isretained. Gym- 
nastics is dropped in the winter and in place of it geometry is inserted.

  398 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95, 
In summer the hours may be of necessity abbreviated, since the 
school session is often disturbed by the needs of the parents and fre- 
quently restricted to the forenoon. In that ease nature study has to 
give up one lesson, language also one hour, and drawing one hour. 
Geometry is combined with arithmetic. An addition is made by insert- 
ing two hours for gymnastics, so that the entire number of weekly hours 
is twenty-eight. The free afternoons may be used frequently for little 
excursions into the woods, where oral instruction is given incidentally 
and in a pleasant manner. 
(c) With regard to the succession of lessons, both psychological and 
physiological rules should be heeded, but local considerations cause 
many deviations from rules prescribed by psychologic-pedagogic de- 
mands. As far as the effect of concentration upon the daily plan of 
lessons is concerned, the lessons should follow according to the degree 
of relationship existing between the branches, so that the unity of the 
whole plan is not violated. A lesson in religion, for instance, might 
be followed by one in history; this may be followed by language, then 
might follow penmanship and singing. But arithmetic or geometry 
should not follow upon a lesson in religion. The combination of 
heterogeneous branches disturbs the mental balance or composure 
of the pupils and the teacher; moreover, it spoils the continuity of 
instruction. . 
Physiological considerations demand that the branches claiming the 
greatest outlay in brain force be treated in the forenoon, when the mind 
is fresh. Branches which aim at mechanical skill can safely be given 
time in the afternoon. However, in some schools the requisite light 
may be wanting in a latitude in which twilight begins before 4 o’clock. 
Again, the “confirmation lessons” conducted by the parish pastor either 
in the church or the parsonage cause much loss.of time owing to the 
long walk for children who have to go to a neighboring village to reach 
the church. . 
It would be utterly futile to prescribe a time-table adapted for every 
school. Local circumstances determine the table everywhere, and occa- 
sional changes of the time table are not at all objectionable since they 
may serve to prevent dead routine. 
Besides the regular time-table designed to aid both teachers and 
pupils, the teacher should prepare for himself another plan, a so-called 
“plan of work,” in which he notes down what each section in each lesson 
does, be it conducted by the teacher himself or by a pupil-teacher, or 
whether it consists of written work and silent occupations. Such a 
plan of work can not be made for the whole year, not even for a term, 
put it is wise to make it from week to week. 
(9) Equipment.—In building and equipping ungraded schools the 
wealth or poverty of the community is in most cases regarded above 
considerations arising from the demands of pedagogy and hygiene. 
At this point we have nothing to do with local considerations and may 
 
-P-A-G-E-457
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 399 
confine ourselves to the latter point, which is not até all ‘ncnmciiiin: 
with economic equipment. 
(a) The schoolhouse must have a healthy location far from disturbing 
noise, such as paved streets would cause. It must not be surrounded 
closely by trees which would shade the schoolroom windows, though 
the spacious playgrounds should be studded with trees. Since in cen- 
tral Europe in rural schools the dwelling of the teacher is usually under 
the same roof with the schoolroom, it is well to have the schoolroom 
and teacher’s study or office connected by a glass door. The school- 
room should be bright and spacious, more wide than long, so that the 
whole school is-divided by a broad aisle into two sections, each one of 
which contains two classes or grades. If the pupils’ seats are as they 
should be, adjustable to the height of the pupils, it will materially aid 
in organizing and managing the school. It is not advisable to have the 
teacher’s desk perched on a high platform, but it should be on a level 
with the class, and might be movable, so that the teacher, if necessity 
arises, can move himself as the center of attention, and yet have his 
aids and paraphernalia within reach. It is also advisable to place a 
screen in the aisle between the class which the teacher hears himself 
and the others busy in their seats. One or two more screens used in 
the corners may serve to deaden the sound caused by the work of pupil- 
teachers. The location of the windows is very important. If they are 
high and placed so that the light falls upon the left and the rear of the 
children, they will serve all the different classes and leave wall space 
enough for blackboards and charts. 
(b) The apparatus and other devices must be ample, yet of such a 
nature that they will claim little space. When procuring them it 
must be considered that they are to.serve an entire school system, 
hence must embrace the objects required by all the eight grades of 
the school. Much more space should be utilized for blackboards. One 
space can be provided for painted lines for penmanship, and for writing 
music. If there is an anteroom which can be utilized by pupil-teachers 
it should have a blackboard also. Spaces between the windows and 
doors may be used for matters which it is desirable to exhibit for a 
longer time than a day or a lesson. Charts and maps should be 
arranged like window curtains, so that they can be rolled up, and thus 
saved from the destructive effect of dust. There must be picture 
charts for illustrating history and geography. The school should also 
have a cabinet with objects for nature study and object lessons, which 
cabinet can be replenished with new objects procured during the brief 
excursions. An abacus, reading charts, and the like should never be 
wanting. 
The number of text-books should be very limited. All that seems to 
be necessary in this line is a Bible—that is to say, a school Bible, not 
the unabridged edition—a catechism, which is usually bound together 
with the school Bible; a hymn book; a reader, which may at the same
-P-A-G-E-458
  400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
time be used as a source of information for historic, geographic, and 
other instruction; a book of examples for arithmetic, and a small book 
of songs. It is absolutely necessary, however, to have the readers 
graded in at least four books. Where it is admissible, exercise books 
should be used for the branches that require the retention of numer- 
ous facts. It is to be regretted that the needs of the ungraded school 
in regard to text-books are rarely considered by authors, most text- 
books being compiled for the special needs of the graded school; hence 
much more preparation is required of the rural teacher than of the 
city teacher. 
(10) The teacher's position.—The external conditions of the teacher in 
ungraded schools leave much to be desired. 
(a) The salary of rural teachers in Prussia and in Bavaria, as well 
as in other German States, rarely reaches the sum of 1,000 marks, 
equal to $250, and in very exceptional cases does it exceed 1,000 marks. 
This sum appears very small, but it should not be forgotten that the 
teacher does not have to pay rent; he lives in the schoolhouse, and 
frequently has the use of from 5 to 40 acres of land. In most cases 
the teacher is obliged to work this school land and raise provisions. 
Where the teacher has a large family this item is of no small account. 
Sometimes he is obliged to give private lessons and do other work to 
increase his salary. Positions that offer very low salaries are usually 
given to young normal-school graduates, who are always well enough 
versed in economic living to make both ends meet. These conditions 
make ethical and scientific instruction very difficult. Not until the 
teacher is free from material care can his work in school become bene- 
ficial to his pupils and to the entire community. So long as he is an 
object of pity and commiseration he will not exercise that influence 
which the teacher of the growing generation must command to be useful 
to the children and their parents. 
(b) Viewed from the standpoint of pedagogical science, the super- 
vision of ungraded schools leaves much to be desired. It is frequently 
performed by men who have a theorétic and philosophic professional 
education, but in the rarest cases a pedagogical preparation. This want 
is the natural consequence of the absence of pedagogical seminaries 
in universities. Moreover, the supervisory officers learn to know the 
ungraded school only from occasional visits; and they are usually per- 
forming the duties of supervisors in addition to other regular duties, 
such as the duties of pastors. Though it is required of such men to 
spend six weeks in a normal school after they lave completed their uni- 
versity course, this smattering of professional education is insufficient 
to do full justice to the schools under their charge, schools which, by 
their numerical importance, are one of the most essentiakksources of. 
culture for the majority of the people. Again, no one can serve two 
masters, the church and the school; church services and school services 
should be separated. Teachers who have gone through a regular course
-P-A-G-E-459
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 401 
of normal training perceive more accurately the insufficiency of the pres- 
ent system of supervision. Young graduates being placed in charge 
of rural schools, though they may be theoretically well supplied with 
knowledge, need professional advice, and under the present cireum- 
stances can not get it. Goltsch, in his book on Courses of Study for 
Rural Schools, says: 
It is hard to place young teachers face to face with a problem which can be solved 
only by unusually talented persons, a problem of which neither local nor provincial 
school inspectors, nor the highest educational authority in the State, can tell in 
what way he may solve it. 
In order to obviate this difficulty the establishment of pedagogical 
university seminaries, with practice schools attached, would be neces- 
sary. In these institutions the professors of normal schools and the 
supervisors of city and rural schools might be professionally prepared. 
The right to attend them should be granted to teachers of elementary 
schools if they can prove their capacity for academic study, and if the 
result of their normal-school training, as well as successful study of at 
least two foreign languages, would justify admission. Another condi- 
tion of admission might be a number of years of successful experience 
in a public school. This last condition should also be required of min- 
isters and philologists, if they apply for supervisors’ offices. Not until 
such conditions‘ are required can it be hoped that persons intrusted 
with the supervision of schools will become authorities for the teachers 
of the rural schools. Not until they have gained experience in teach- 
ing will they be able to advise the teachers under their charge; and it 
must be insisted upon that their office should not be a supplementary 
office, but that they give all their time and power to supervision of 
schools. If the possibility is open to rural teachers to be promoted to 
the office of supervisor, it will increase their aspirations and effectually 
promote the rural schools in general. 
(c) With the question of supervision is intimately connected the ques- 
tion of rank. There have been contentions between the rural teachers 
and principals of graded schools. It is claimed that the teacher of a 
rural school conducts an entire system, i. e., that he has pupils of all 
grades, but that his field of activity is narrowed down by the fact that 
they are allin oneroom. However, they claim the rank of a principal— 
a claim that has not been recognized by the authorities. 
(a) The position of the rural teacher within the community seems to 
eall for a reform. It has been stated before that the teachers of the 
ungraded schools come into more frequent and intimate contact with 
the families of their pupils than the teachers of other schools. They 
can therefore exert an influence upon the home, resulting in interest- 
ing the parents in the work of the school, so that they assist his work, 
and indirectly the teacher can thus influence home education. He can 
do so directly by public lectures, “evening gatherings for parents,” and
-P-A-G-E-460
  402 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
similar entertainments. Not often have teachers time for this kind of 
public work, because most teachers of ungraded schools are called upon 
to perform all kinds of nonpedagogical work; they are frequently called 
upon to do sexton’s work and act as organist during church services. 
Very frequently they are secretaries of the common council, and for all 
these extra duties they receive little or no pay. If the teacher’s time 
and strength could be concentrated upon his educational duties, it would 
be a great advantage to him and to the school under his charge; in that 
case he could do much to enlighten the community on educational ques- 
tions and become a live factor in the education of the entire community. 
(11) Statistics —How important and far-reaching the promotion of 
the entire education of the people would be, if the system of ungraded 
schools were fostered in the spirit indicated in the foregoing article, 
may be seen from the statistics of this kind of schools. The following 
numbers are taken from the official statistics published by the Govern- 
ment of Prussia in the year 1891, In that year the Kingdom had 
16,600 ungraded schools, in which 962,079 children were taught by 
15,548 teachers. Of these were 51 ambulatory schools without teach- 
ers, and 3 with 2 teachers. This explains the difference between the 
number of schools and that of teachers. Since the total number of all 
schools in the Kingdom in that year was 37,742, with 82,746 classes and 
71,731 teachers, it is plain that 47 per cent of all the schools were 
ungraded in which 22 per cent of the total number of teachers taught. 
Most of these schools were overcrowded. Their normal attendance, 
placed officially at less than 80 pupils, was found in 13,639 schools with 
682,260 children. Of these there were 2,135 schools with fewer than 30 
school children. The number of schools with abnormal attendance was 
2,906 with 279,819 pupils, and of these 2,079 had between 81 and 100 
pupils each, 796 had between 101 and 150, and 31 had even more than 
150 pupils. During the last ten years numerous ungraded schools, owing 
to their overcrowded condition, were changed into schools of two 
grades, of which each had a half-day’s instruction. Though the num- 
ber of purely ungraded schools was thereby decreased, the number of 
teachers was not, accordingly, increased. In the year 1882 Prussia 
had 20,082 ungraded schools with 1,336,404 children with 20,016 teach- 
ers. From this it is seen that 61 per cent of the schools were ungraded. 
No less than 14,453 schools with 744,688 pupils had normal, 5,629 with 
595,716 pupils had abnormal attendance; that is to say, more than the 
required number, fixed at 80. Of the latter, 2,975 had between 81 and 
100 children, 796 had between 101 and. 150, and 329 had more than 150 
children. On the other hand, in 1882 there were only 2,989 schools of 
two grades with 1 teacher attended by 337,801 children, against 5,878 
of such schools attended by 568,235 children in 1891. The change of 
ungraded schools into schools of two grades with 1 teacher has of 
course decreased the overcrowding, but this is of questionable benefit. 
A teacher may find it easier to maintain discipline in two grades than
-P-A-G-E-461
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 403 
if the pupus were altogether in one room, but it decreases tne time 
devoted to their instruction to one-half, hence the educational influence 
of the teacher is considerably lessened by this reduction. In the year 
1882 a teacher of a half-day school had, on an average, 113 pupils; in 
1891 he still had 96. This arrangement of half-day schools increases 
the duties of the teacher enormously. In the Kingdom of Saxony, in 
the principality of Anhalt, and in a few other German States, the half 
day school is preferred generally, while purely ungraded schools are 
found in the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Wiirtemberg, and in the grand 
duchies of Hesse, Oldenburg, Weimar, Gotha, and. Mecklenburg. In 
Austria the division into half-day schools is performed as soon as the 
number of pupils rises above 50. 
Literature.— Until recently the number of books on rural schools was 
very meager. Zeller’s Lehren der Erfahrung (Basel, 1827) is very 
much out of date, also a book entitled Einrichtungs- und Lehrplan fiir 
Dorfschulen (Berlin, 1752). The latter work gave preference to half- 
day schools. The noted educators and authors, Diesterweg, Dittes, 
and Kehr, did not mention the village school at all, or only with 
passing notice. In recent years the ungraded school has found very 
much attention in educational literature. The best of the books pub- 
lished are: (1) Heinemann, Hinklassige Volksschule, Gera, Hofmann, 
1827, (2) Pfeifer, Theorie und Praxis der einklassigen Volksschule, 
Gotha, Thienemann, 2 vols., 1887. Both Heinemann and Pfeifer treat 
the subject with reference to the idea of concentration. (3) Florin, 
Methodik der Gesammtschule, Ziirich, Schulthess. He treats organi- 
zation, instruction, and the utilization of pupil-teachers with much 
eare. (4) Lehrplan fiir einfache Volksschulen, an essay in the twenty- 
third Yearbook of the Society for Scientific Pedagogy, is worthy of 
mention. : 
V.—GERMAN OPINIONS ON THE BELL-LANCASTER METHOD OF MUTUAL 
INSTRUCTION. c 
(1) Schmidt, History of Pedagogy: 
The essential features of the Bell-Lancaster or Monitorial Method consists in mak- 
ing the advanced pupils teachers of the beginners and other pupils of lower grades, 
Theso ‘‘ pupil-teachers” teach or transmit only elementary knowledge after rigidly 
and minutely prescribed schemes, whilo the teacher, like an overseer in a factory, 
teaches but little, and chiefly conducts and supervises the action of his monitors. 
This mode of conducting schools is considered the surest means of gradually exer- 
cising the powers of thinking by applying knowledge previcusly acquired and of 
fixing facts in the mind by communicating them to others. It fits instruction to the 
needs of the individual children better by exactly grading them in classes according 
to their mental advancement. It sharply defines the matter of instruction, arranges 
it carefully, and divides it into convenient steps, thus educating the powers of the 
juvenile mind in every direction, for the pupil does not only receive or acquire 
knowledge, but has constant opportunities for applying new cognitions and newly 
learned facts for the benefit of others, while in a regular school the children might 
sit still for whole hours, only occupied with listening, thinking, and answering 
questions, The real teacher of a Bell-Lancaster school has many chances of obsery- 
4
-P-A-G-E-462
  
  404 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
ing his pupils in different positions, thus learning their dispositions, special talents, 
and aptitudes. Finally, the monitorial system arouses the love of fellow-beings; it 
generates the consciousness that we are all dependent upon one another. Hence it 
creates a common feeling in the pupils and pleasure in reciprocal aid and mutual 
work for the benefit of all. The pupil fecls that he does not exist for his own self, 
but for others and the whole community of which he is an integral part. In oppo- 
sition to Bell-Lancaster’s method, it is claimed (chiefly by Diesterweg) that the 
subdued voice (necessary in this mode of teaching where several classes are reciting 
in one room) in reading does not develop the organs of speech, the accent disappears, 
and thoughtless reading is promoted. Arithmetic becomes purely mechanical, 
because the young helper can not point out the reason of any process. Penmanship 
is neglected, since that art depends less upon constant practice than upon taste for 
symmetry and the beautiful, which taste can only be awakened by sensible and 
well-directed instruction in correct seeing and imitating. The whole organization 
of the school tempts the teacher to fallinto mechanism, It is truea greater number 
of children may be set into external action by means of the monitorial system, but 
not into internal action, yet the latter alone promotes the true aim of the school. 
(2) Zschokke! (in 1822) said in his book, Elementary Schools, on 
mutual instruction— 
Bell’s invention must be considered a benefit to the human race, and, in spite of 
stale talk of ignorant scribblers, mutual instruction will spread more and more in 
all the nations of the world. Its inner value, proved by experience, will speak for 
it. It will give to the human race a new form by ennobling the lowest, depraved, 
and most numerous class of people. This easy, sure, and cheap means of common 
education of the people will, no doubt, be in general use in all the five continents 
within a few decades. 
The Bell-Lancaster system or method spread with remarkable rapid- 
ity. All over England Lancasterian schools sprang up. In 1811 
more than 30,000 children were taught in that way in England. In 
1814 a society for Great Britain and foreign countries was formed for 
the establishment of Lancasterian schools. As early as 1806 the 
method found its way into the United States; in 1810, into Calcutta; 
in 1813, into Canada and the Cape Colony; in 1814, into Sierra Leone 
and Sydney, as well as in all European countries, so that in 1813 more 
than 100,000 children were taught in that way. 
(3) Lindner, in his Encyclopedian Manual, says: 
Indeed, it must be admitted that the idea of mutual instruction was an excellent 
one, especially for ungraded schools, where the teacher has several grades, that is, 
pupils of varying age and accomplishments. However, a system of schools based 
upon this method can be only a makeshift which violates the principle that an 
“unfinished” (undeveloped) mind can not well instruct others still less developed. 
Education being both a science and an art, can not well be pursued by young per- 
sons who are not even apprentices in the business. If, however, we consider that 
the ungraded (rural) school is still very numerous (in Austria 53 per cent of all 
elementary schools are “ one-class schools” ) the monitorial system is not without 
its merits. 
(4) Sanders’s Lexicon of Pedagogy: 
The Bell-Lancaster method was very much overrated in the beginning. It spread 
oyer England and a large part of Europe. It was welcomed with great hopes by 
1 Noted Swiss educator, author, and statesman, 1771-1847.
-P-A-G-E-463
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 405 
friends of popular education in states and countries in which elementary education 
for the people was still in its infancy, as, for instance, in Greece, Spain, and Portugal. 
Through an enthusiastic report of Colonel von Abramson, in 1819, the Danish King 
Frederick VI was persuaded to promote Bell and Lancaster’s system, and in conse- 
quence it found general favor in Denmark, also in the German provinces Schleswig- 
Holstein (at that time parts of the Kingdom of Denmark and of the German federa- 
tion). The normal school at Eckernférde was the central seat of the agitation for 
this system, but here it was materially modified by adapting it to the principles of 
Pestalozzi. In other German states the system found only occasional support. 
Diesterweg opposed it with his inimitable critical weapons. Time and experience 
have brought out the faults and merits of the system. As a substitute for a real 
school with a true teacher it can never serve. The teacher’s personal influence is a 
‘‘conditio sine qua non” for truly educative and formative instruction, even in 
¢echnical branches, such as writing, drawing, singing, etc. Modern pedagogy has 
retained the monitorial feature by allowing the oldest and best gifted pupils to teach 
the lowest grade under the supervision of the teacher, who at the close of the lessons 
or the day’s work revises and corrects his assistant’s work. In Prussia this is done 
in many overcrowded schools, and it is from these monitors, or pupil teachers, 
that the normal school candidates are chiefly selected. The older pupils who are 
intrusted with teaching derive much profit from this service, provided always that 
tho teacher keep his school well in hand and supervise their work, so that the indi- 
viduality of every pupil may be studied by him. In other words, the system works 
well if the teacher remains the teacher and does not sink to the level of an overseer 
of mechanical contrivances. In that case tho older pupils who act as his assistants 
gain much knowledge and retain what they are taught. 
(5) Zerrener says in his Book of Methods: 
Mutual or monitorial instruction is that method, according to which the teacher, 
if he have pupils varying much in age, classifies his pupils according to their capacity 
and teaches these pupils together, thus making a number of divisions, one of which 
he teaches ata time, while the others review and practice what they have been 
taught, and do it undersupervision and with the aid of pupils of an advanced grade. 
This mode of procedure has been applied in thousands of schools for several years, 
and has proved most beneficial. Every teacher who has a number of pupils varying 
much in age and accomplishments should adopt it. 
The essential in mutual instruction is: 
(a) That the teacher divide all the pupils of his room into two (or three) divisions 
to facilitate instruction. In primary grades two are sufficient; in schools of more 
varied accomplishments three divisions seem advisable. 
(b) That the teacher grade the matter of instruction in reading, history, and arith- 
metic in a definite number of steps. In reading, for instance, in 15; in writing, in 
10; in arithmetic, in 14 steps, called steps of a course. 
(c) That the teacher carefully examine and grade his pupils according to the steps 
of his course. 
(d) That he himself teach in every branch of the course and guide the progress of 
his pupils from step to step. 
(e) That he occupy those divisions not under his immediate care by giving them 
exercises in review or application of the matter learned. 
(f) That in these exercises, also, he divide the pupils according to the steps of the 
course. 
(g) That the supervision and guidance in this work be intrusted in each branch to 
pupils at least three steps ahead of the division. 
(hb) That the number of pupils intrusted to such subushers or pupil teachers be 
not too large (3 to 4 in reading, 6 to 8 in writing, 4 to 6 in arithmetic). 
(i) That, as far as practicable, all pupils of the teachers’ room be called upon in
-P-A-G-E-464
  406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the regular course to act as subushers, since the work is very important for their own 
development. 
(j) That the teacher, by keeping a list, make it possible to regulate the activity 
of his pupil teachers and steadily keep his eye on a good classification of his school. 
Day or minute books are a necessity. 
VI—COURSES OF STUDY FOR PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN 
CENTRAL EUROPE. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The National Educational Association has recognized the great impor- 
tance of the question as to what and how much to teach in the public 
schools by appointing in subsequent annual meetings committees of 
inquiry into the courses of study (a) for secondary, (b) for city elemen- 
tary, and (c) for rural schools. Never in the history of this educational 
association has a question been treated with more dignity, profound 
research, and satisfactory results. The reports of the two first-men- 
tioned committees have been published and widely circulated; the 
third is still in preparation at this writing. The particular problem of 
finding the relative value of studies has of late agitated the minds 
of German teachers as well, as is seen by the results of comparison of 
the courses prescribed for various cities, a copy of which is here offered 
in English. It is noteworthy that the plans offered in the following 
sketches show the relative value of the branches expressed in the num- 
ber of lessons assigned to them. This of course does not consider the 
personal element, the teacher, but presupposes that the schools are 
provided with professionally well-prepared teachers who have had a 
normal sehool training of from four to six years. This is a feature 
of the question with which we can not reckon in this country as yet. 
Although the normal schools here increase in number and attendance 
from year to year, the profession of teaching is not as yet well defined 
in the United States, hence much more weight is attached to the exter- 
nals of public education—the schoolhouses, equipments, devices, and 
eourses of study. This fact will make the following showing from 
sixteen cities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland very interesting. 
They were published in the Paedagogische Zeitung of Berlin, attracted 
much attention, and in a few cases resulted in an adjustment of differ- 
ences, as indicated in footnotes. 
I. SKETCIL OF VARIOUS COURSES IN OPERATION. 
Want of familiarity on the part of the American reader with the con- 
ditions of German publie schools, and the peculiar development they 
have had during nearly two hundred years of existence, do not permit 
a comprehensive treatment of the courses of study pursued in German 
people’s schools. Many restrictions are thereby caused. Only essen- 
tials can be discussed, and hence it will be best to confine the discussion 
to typical examples of courses in use. In regard to particulars, it will
-P-A-G-E-465
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 407 
be found advisable to examine only the fully developed school organ- 
izations—that is, the graded schcol—because the conditions in question 
are there best represented, and because these schools are primarily in 
the position to be serviceable in the intended investigations. In less 
favorable conditions—that is, in schools not so well graded—the given 
factors always cause a diminution of work. In the following statement 
we shall endeavor to answer the two questions: 
(1) Is the course of study in German people’s schools of such a 
nature that the lower grades afford a proper foundation for all other 
educational institutions? 
(2) Does the course of study in the upper grades of German people’s 
schools inelude the branches generally considered necessary, and recog- 
nized by professional teachers as essential, to the education of the 
people? 
The answer in substance to the first of these questions is found in the 
time-tables of the schools. Advanced education recognizes as abso- 
lutely essential a knowledge of elementary branches (reading, language, 
writing, arithmetic) and a good perceptive faculty. To institutions like 
the intermediate and secondary schools, which, without exception, begin 
with the elements of different studies, it is more of a drawback thau 
an advantage to begin a number of subjects without bringing any to a 
definite conclusion. Where the time-table of the lower grades shows 
that most attention is given to elementary instruction in reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, grammar, object lessons, and reasoning, the people’s 
school may as a rule be accepted as an appropriate foundation for all 
these institutions. The chief object in presenting the following tables 
is to show the essential differences of German States in this regard. 
The tables for the first four or five years alone would be sufficient to 
show this, but as the significance, extension, and treatment of a num- 
ber of studies in the upper grades are to be discussed later on the 
whole course is given at once, to economize space. It is the object also 
to treat the separate German States as far as can be done in their usual 
order. 
The foundation for the order of study of Prussian people’s schools is 
given in the general regulations of Minister Dr. Falk of the 15th of 
October, 1872. The general regulations prescribe for graded schools:'

‘Where there is but one number in a column, the statement applies to both sexes. 
If the number refers only to boys, a naught is added in brackets. The numbers 
referring to girls only are inclosed in brackets,
-P-A-G-E-466
  408 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
This order has had later corrections by the same authority. By 
commission of Minister von Gossler (25th of July, 1884) the provincial 
authorities were empowered to extend religious instruction by one Bible 
lesson; consequently, to prescribe six and five hours of weekly religious 
instruction in schools of one grade and several grades, respectively. 
The original time-table of the general regulations has not been 
strictly adhered to in any part of the State. It is, moreover, decidedly 
obscure. Which years are to be included in each of the three grades 
it does not state. But as it is decided that if the school has four 
classes two shall constitute the middle, and with six successive 
classes two shall cover the ground of one grade, one must presume 
that in schools of four grades the upper grade begins with the seventh 
year; in schools of six grades with the fifth year. A wide scope is 
thus given the teacher to work out his own plan. In the former case, 
the middle grade embraces four years; in the latter, two; in the for- 
mer, history, geography, and natural history must be begun in the 
second year (which has actually been attempted in several instances); 
in the latter, in the third. 
Two typical examples of both extremes in the scales here considered 
are furnished by the time-table of the people’s schools in Charlotten- 
burg and the elementary schools in Wiesbaden.

German custom (tho I grade being the highest, even when the reversed designation is made use of). 
For uniformity’s sake, writing and object lessons aro always included in language lessons, natural 
history and science are classed as nature study, and preparatory instruction for geography (study of 
homo and environs) included with geography. Particular features are explained in footnotes.

The difference is very apparent. If we compare the third and fourth 
years in both plans we shall see the essential difference between an 
elementary school and a school occupied from the very start with 
a wholly unnatural multiplicity of studies, and beginning nearly all 
the branches included in the people’s school curriculum at the same 
age, when the average faculty of comprehension has not been sufficiently 
developed. 
Tn the old Prussian provinces, particularly in those east of the Elbe 
River, schools of six grades predominate; they follow the “General 
regulations” rather closely. The people’s schools in Dantzic, Posen, 
Breslau, Stettin, and Halle present only unimportant differences. In 
Dantzic, Stettin, and Halle, history, geography, and natural history 
are taught in the third year; in Posen and Breslau, instruction in 
history is deferred until the fourth year. In nearly every instance 
drawing is begun in the second year; until lately, in Berlin two special 
drawing lessons were prescribed even for the first year. The present 
time-table in communal schools in Berlin is as follows:

missioner of Education for 1893-94, p.295, where the courses for 1840, 1860, 1873, and 1893 are compared. 
  The amount of time devoted to female handiwork (formerly eight 
hours weekly), the early beginning of drawing, the third hour of geom- 
etry in the upper grade, and the small number of language lessons in 
the upper grades of female schools are characteristic of this plan. The 
model thereby proposed has rarely been followed outside of Berlin.

  410 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The time-tables for the people’s schools of the new Prussian provinces 
resemble in general the plan of Wiesbaden more than that of the schools 
of six grades in the cities just mentioned. The people’s schools in Kiel 
(8 grades) begin only geography with two hours in the third year, his- 
tory and nature study with one hour in the fourth year. In Altona 
the three lower grades have only three hours of religion. In Ostia- 
bruck nature study begins with one hour in the third year, geography 
is introduced in the fourth, history in the fifth, and geometry in the 
sixth year. 
The people’s schools of Bavaria have no common order of study. 
That of Munich seems most characteristic. It reflects the purpose of the 
general primary school most clearly, and in the upper grade endeavors 
to satisfy the higher claims on public instruction, as far as can be pos- 
sible within the limits of a seven-years compulsory attendance. Tor 
comparison the order of study in Augsburg is placed in juxtaposition. 
The course in Nuremberg is about a medium between the two, whilst 
that at Wurzburg differs widely in dev ae a great many hours to 
religious instruction.

The following regulations apply to country schools throughout the 
Kingdom of Wurtemberg. With an aggregate number of twenty-six 
hours per week, one-third must be devoted to religion, including mem- 
orizing hymns and Bible texts. The remainder, as well as all hours 
over twenty-six, are devoted to other studies in the proportion of three- 
sevenths to language, two-sevenths to arithmetic and mensuration, and 
two-sevenths to history, geography, nature study, and singing. Teach- 
ers for a long time have endeavored to reduce the one-third devoted to 
the study of religion, but without apparent success. 
In Saxony and the Thuringian States under its direct influence there 
exist two or three kinds of people’s schools. We shall here consider 
only the lower people’s or district schools and the burgher schools, 
which in many places pursue the same course as intermediate people’s 
schools or advanced schools elsewhere. In Leipsic the advanced and 
district male schools follow exactly the same course; the female schools 
present few differences. In Dresden the deviations are greater.

In the first year of burgher or advanced schools and -district or 
elementary schools in Leipsic, the sessions number only sixteen hours 
per week in the first four years of elementary schools; in Zwickau they 
number twelve, fourteen, eighteen, twenty-two (girls twenty-three) 
hours, and in advanced schools twelve, sixteen, twenty-two, twenty- 
four (girls twenty-six) hours. The conditions prevailing in the Thu- 
ringian States resemble in essential points those of Saxony; in some 
States, as in Weimar, the Prussian model has been followed. 
The special features of the course of study in the people’s schools in 
Baden are officially defined. Elementary embraces sixteen, advanced 
instruction twenty-six to thirty hours. In the latter case, three are 
devoted to religion, nine to ten to language, four to five to arithmetic, 
two to singing, six to seven to history, geography, and nature study. 
Communities are allowed to establish advanced people’s schools in place 
of or in connection with the people’s schools required by law. Mann- 
heim furnishes an instance of the first case. The city besides supports 
advanced people’s and girls’ schools, likewise designated “advanced 
people’s schools”; in them, however, French is a compulsory study, 
whereas in the other people’s schools foreign languages are optional.

The course of study in Hessia is almost identical with that of Prussia 
prescribed in the “General regulations,” particularly in the amount 
of time given to religion and in the early special study of history, 
geography, and nature study. Buta radical deviation in the Hessian 
regulation prescribes fewer hours for the first two years, and divides 
graded schools into four instead of three grades, thus paving the way 
for schools of eight grades.

In Mayence the eighth and seventh grades have each three, the other 
grades each five hours of religion. 
Schools in the middle and minor States of north Germany incline to 
those of Prussia. The conditions of the city schools_of the two Meck- 
lenburgs are identical with those of the provinces east of the Elbe 
River. Rural schools are considered only the beginnings of educational 
institutions. Oldenburg, the capital, has schools of eight grades; 
Bremen and Liibeck follow the example of the new provinces of Prus- 
sia. In Brunswick Saxon influences prevail. We select only three 
schools from the different States.

aThe school board of Hanover has prepared a course in which the following radical changes are 
proposed: The seventh grado should receive eighteen hours in summer and twenty in winter; the 
sixth grado twenty-four, tho fourth grado thirty. The other grades retain the same number. Somo 
studies suffer the following alterations: Religion is not studied in the seventh grade and is limited to 
two hours in the other grades; language is much further advanced; female handiwork is limited in 
the intermediate and omitted from the two lower grades. 
The people’s schools of Alsace and Lorraine differ widely. Miilhausen 
has schools of eight, Strassburg of six, five, and four grades. Particu- 
lars may be omitted, since they would scarcely enhance the value of 
this statement. 
The purpose of people’s schools and the arrangement of studies in 
Austria and in some Swiss cantons appears desirable. Furthermore, 
from an American point of view, their time-tables correspond better to 
the purpose of common schools than most German tables presented in 
the foregoing.

The foregoing tables invite eomparison in very different directions. 
The aim of education in the lower grades is defined by the earlier or later 
introductionof history, geography, and nature study, and by the latitude 
given to religious instruction. As the addition of new studies signifies 
in most cases the existence of a course in the sciences, itis of importance 
that the beginning and extent of these studies be for some schools pre- 
sented synoptically in the introduction. This has been attempted in 
the following table, which, however, only includes schools for boys."

a In this and tho following table the years of the course are mentioned, since the grades, not being uniform, would give no adequate idea. In schools of six grades the grade corresponds to the period 
from tho sixth to the eighth year; in schools of seven grades, to the period including the seventh and 
eighth years. Tho tables, arranged accordingly, will speak for themselves. The numbers in the 
columns signify the number of hours per week.

fold, Cassel, New Brandenburg, and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. 
b The same in Duisburg. 
eIn Leipsie religion begins in the second quarter of the first year; in Zwickau religious instruction 
is prescribed for either sex; and in the second year none for boys. Bible history is commenced with 
object lessons. 
@ Like those in Prussia, the schools of Mannheim have only two hours for religion, choral singing 
is included in religion and omitted from singing. 
eThe same in Worms. 
A second factor of paramount influence in the plan or course of study, 
as the foregoing examples show, is religious instruction There is a 
great difference in the fact whether people’s schools have six or seven 
hours of religion in the upper grade or two, as in Munich and Hamburg, 
or whether it be omitted altogether, asin Basel. The foregoing arrange- 
ment in form of a table will not be without value in the explanation of 
this point in the discussion following later on. 
Whoever examines this table will be convinced that opinions on the 
subject of the amount of necessary religious instruction in the German 
Empire greatly vary. As far as it affects the subject a thoroughly 
frank explanation of this point is therefore permissible without provok- 
ing unfavorable criticism. The following table (p. 417) shows that pre- 
paratory departments of intermediate and secondary schools for girls 
essentially differ in this as in many other points, although the true cause 
may not be found in the facts themselves.

For the purpose of comparison with people’s schools the lower grades 
suffice. As a rule, only two hours of religion are prescribed for pre- 
paratory classes of secondary schools for boys. The entire number of 
hours varies between sixteen and twenty-two per week. The upper 
grade very rarely has more. The course of intermediate schools pre- 
scribed by Minister Dr. Falk allows three hours of religion for the 
three lower and two for the three upper grades. The study of home 
geography is added to elementary branches only in the third year. 
History and nature study are reserved for the fourth year. Why are 
other regulations in existence for people’s schools? Or rather, is it 
beneficial to people’s schools to differ so widely from the institutions 
for wealthier strata of society? 
In the next article it will be shown how and to what extent the 
demands of reform in the upper grades of people’s schools are found 
realized in the courses of study of secondary institutions. This would 
seem an unfailing test to Americans who naturally consider the sec- 
ondary school as building on the results of the lower schools. 
Il. THE DEMANDS OF THE TIME AND THE COURSE OF STUDY. 
The second question is: Does the course of study in the upper grade 
of people’s schools include those branches generally considered neces- 
sary and recognized by professional teachers as essential to the educa- 
tion of the people? 
Official regulations and general orders fail to give a satisfactory reply 
to this question. The previous pages have shown how the purpose of 
people’s schools is understood in most German States, and by means 
of what studies they endeavor to attain the end in view. No Prussian 
Jaw has reference to the subject indicated in the second question. In 
sketching the actual conditions we shall often meet unexpected facts 
face to face. 
In regard to modern demands the attitude of the Prussian depart- 
ment of public instruction has, in general, been one of reserve. No

A418 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. - 
one knows the opinion of the central authority on public and private 
instruction in political economy or its position toward the study of the 
constitution and law. We look in vain for any reference to the matter 
in the numerous directions issued annually by the minister of instrue- 
tion. In view of the fact that political economy is being generally 
introduced, a text-book for instruction in that branch for use in normal 
schools would be desirable. The department has, however, defined 
its position plainly and distinetly in reference to the one subject of 
domestic science or economy. In a decree of the 18th of January, 
1893, Dr. Bosse, minister of public instruction, emphasizes the fact 
that a perceptible restriction of other studies in favor of domestic 
science is receiving careful consideration, but authorizes a shortening 
of the time of the other lessons by two hours a week. In an order of 
the 9th of March, 1894, the high educational importance of domestic 
science is likewise recognized; but in principle the study is referred to 
obligatory continuation schools, which do not exist for girls in Prussia. 
This order gives domestic science as well as manual training for boys 
an independent position outside of school. This standpoint is con- 
firmed in the following words: 
Even though I fully recognize the educatioual value of such efforts as are mani- 
fested in manual training and domestic science, and which are directed to excite and 
develop the mind and aptitude of youth for practical pursuits, and though I am will- 
ing and ready to promote tho establishment for that purpose by appropriations in 
keeping with available funds, I must nevertheless insist upon it that the people’s 
schools suffer no loss and apply their entire time in enabling youth to acquire on 
the basis of valuable knowledge the moral and religious education which the suc- 
cess of their later practical occupations demands. 
In this order the minister discountenances their introduction into the 
school course and relegates them to free afternoons. It is further 
recommended to exclude theoretical instructions in nature study, com- 
putation of prices, etc., from domestic science and combine them with 
the appropriate disciplinary studies. In a late order of the 10th of 
February, 1895, provoked by the introduction of domestic science into 
the people’s girls’ schools in Posen, the minister repeats these princi- 
ples, and again emphasizes that the time allowed for the present course 
must under no condition be shortened. If the Government continue to 
hold this standpoint, domestic science will not be introduced into the 
regular course, but retain the character of a supplementary study. It 
forms a part of the regular curriculum in the schools of Marienburg, in 
west Prussia. Domestic economy has been introduced into the schools 
of Berlin, Cassel, Hanau, Wiesbaden, Paderborn, Herford, Merseburg, 
Halle, Altona, Pinneberg, Goldberg, Haynau, Eberswald, Neumiinster, 
Kinigsberg, Posen, and Dortmund; in the Kingdom of Saxony, in 
Chemnitz, Zwickau, Meran, Plauen, Freiberg, Rosswein, Glauchau, 
Wilkau, Mitweida, Limbach, Crimmitschau; in Thuringia, in Weimar, 
Jena, Eisenach; in Baden, in Carlsruhe, Mannheim, Heidelberg and 
Baden-Baden.

  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. A19 
Appropriations for education in Prussia since 1894 allow 26,000 
instead of 16,000 marks for the support of manual training for boys. 
Hygiene is provided for in the General Regulations, in which the study 
of the structure and life of the human body is placed at the head of 
natural-history subjects. 
Bookkeeping is not mentioned in any official regulation except for 
continuation schools. 
A visit through Prussian cities, from which later communications 
are at hand, proved that a systematic development of the course of 
study in compliance with present demands has taken place only ina 
few places. Hygiene most frequently receives ample consideration. 
As arule a longer period is reserved for anthropology, in connection 
with which hygiene is taught. This is a manifest result of the require- 
ments in Falk’s General Regulations. This fact demonstrates at a glance 
that reforms are very easily introduced by official order, whilst peda- 
gogical reasons alone do not have that effect. In geography and his- 
tory the constitution of the German Empire and the late social-politieal 
laws are generally defined as subjects to be treated, without, however, 
assigning a special time for their consideration. As far as is known, 
political economy is provided for in Prussia in only isolated instances. 
Berlin has no uniform course for all studies in communal schools. The 
course of history requires the treatment of the constitutions of Prussia 
and the German Empire. Hygiene is included in the course of nature 
study. In arithmetic the text-books of Hellerman and Kliimer are used, 
in which the material for examples is taken from social-political laws 
and economics. Cooking schools have been added to a few communal 
schools; attendance is optional, but stimulated by excuse from two 
hours of female handiwork. 
The new time table for people’s schools in Charlottenburg responds 
more freely to demands of reform. In language lessons particular 
attention is given to business composition. Single-entry bookkeeping 
is introduced in connection with arithmetic into the highest grade for 
boys. Girls work out arithmetical examples of domestic economy, and 
“are instructed how to use a book on domestic economy.” Geography 
in the highest grade embraces the administration of justice, communal 
and state laws, as well as the constitution of the German Empire. In 
natural history practical points of view are repeatedly brought out. 
The course of chemistry and mineralogy for the highest grade for girls 
includes the following subjects: Water (filtration, baths, cooking), 
lighting and heating, stoves; chlorine (disinfection); phosphorus; 
reduction of soda; significance of sodium compounds in a household; 
manufacture of chinaware and glass; manufacture of earthenware (alu- 
minum); vegetable fiber and its decomposition; manufacture of linen; 
cotton; manufacture of paper; starch; dextrin; gum; grape sugar 
(extraction of the sugar); fermentation (brewing of beer, baking of 
bread); manufacture of vinegar; vegetable oils; animal fat; manufac-

ture of soap; use of oils for illumination; dyes; bleaching; dyeing; 
calico printing; albuminoids (albumen, casein, fibrin, etc.); food and its 
preservation. Drawing, too, is practically taught in the upper grades. 
In Dantzic, Breslau, Stettin, Kiel, Flensburg, Hanover, Bielefeld, and 
Cologne the course of study neither includes the specified innovations 
as special branches nor combines them with other studies. 
In Dantzic history in the highest grade embraces the constitution of 
the German Empire, the navy, the protection of colonies, and labor laws. 
Societies have arranged for courses in cooking and manual training. 
In the highest grade of advanced schools in Posen, hygiene and polit- 
ical and domestic economy receive special attention under the heads of 
language, arithmetic, nature study, and history. From the 1st of April, 
1895, cooking lessons are given in advanced and the three elementary 
schools. In the course of study for people’s schools in Magdeburg the 
introduction of the constitution of the German Empire is compulsory. 
Arithmetic, as well as geography and nature study, preclude every more 
direct reference to life. In Halle none of the subjects in question are 
included in the course of study. There is, however, a private manual 
training school; and the material for the examples in the text-book or 
arithmetic by Scharlach and Haupt is derived from circumstances of 
the law pertaining to insurance of the aged and invalids. In Altona 
instruction of history in the highest grade lays special stress on “the 
merits of Prussian rulers in behalf of the people’s welfare.” In nature 
study the human body is studied, particularly in reference to hygiene. 
In connection with a girls’ people’s school there is a cooking school, in 
which pupils are taught how to prepare simple and nutritious dishes. 
This subject is not mentioned in the course, though. In Osnabriick the 
course of natural history and science includes a list of hygienic sub- 
jects (the care of healthy and impaired organs; fractures, care of the 
teeth, gymnastics, and hygienic attitudes; the care and strengthening 
of the nerves; the organs of sense; food—albuminous and farinaceous 
substances; salts, spices, water; articles of food and poisons; influence 
of air—effects of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and carbonic acid; the prep- 
aration of leguminous plants—soft and hard water; cooking in earth- 
enware, copper, and brazen vessels; keeping food in closed vessels; the 
value of nitrogen and carbon in nourishing and warming the body; 
precautions in heating; ventilation; precautions in the use of gas and 
petroleum—cooking and illumination). In history the constitution of 
the German Empire is studied; late laws and the army are treated. 
There are special courses in manual training, in which 350 boys are 
instructed outside of regular school hours. 
In Hagen, in Westphalia, none of the demands mentioned receives 
attention, but manual training is taught outside of school hours at the 
city’s expense. Hygiene, combined with nature study, receives special 
attention in the highest grades of girls’ schools in Dortmund. In con- 
nection with the Protestant people’s schools in that city there is a class
-P-A-G-E-479
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 421 
in domestic economy in which 24 pupils at a time from the six highest 
grades are instructed by a specialist from 2 to half past 5 in the after- 
noon. Bielefeld has decided to allow for housekeeping and cooking - 
schools. In Cologne several courses of manual training are conducted. 
during free afternoons. In Cassel law is combined with history 
and religion, hygiene with nature study, and political economy with 
arithmetic. Thereader for the upper grade hasan appendix on political 
economy. The girls of the highest grades in arithmetic are directed 
how to keep an account book; those of the eighth year are instructed in 
housekeeping four hours a week. Beginning with the year 1896, house- 
keeping, combined with cooking, will be introduced into the elementary 
schools of Wiesbaden by way of experiment. Reports from that city 
further state that an effort has been made in all the schools to meet 
modern demands in history, geography, and arithmetic. In Biebrich, 
on the Rhine (near Wiesbaden), hygiene is included in the course of 
study ; law, political economy, and housekeeping are occasionally touched 
upon, with other branches. 
In the course of study in people’s schools of Bavaria the following 
regulations deserve mention. Bookkeeping for girls as well as boys is 
to be combined partly with written language work and partly with 
-arithmetic (official orders of January 26 and February 16, 1891). An 
official order of December 16, 1875, requires pupils to be instructed in 
the principles of hygiene, partly in connection with reading and partly 
with nature study. As people’s schools of Bavaria have obligatory 
continuation schools and supplementary summer schools in which the 
branches mentioned are treated, these demands step into the back- 
ground in actual practice in the lower schools. In the course for peo- 
ple’s schools in Munich none of the demands mentioned are considered. 
Since the 1st of March, 1895, the Society for Popular Enlightenment, 
of that city, has instituted a housekeeping school; a course in cooking 
will also be opened. In Nuremberg these branches are only occasion- 
ally touched upon. In Augsburg, as in Munich, elementary study of 
law is reserved for obligatory continuation schools. Domestic economy 
is taught in the advanced female school. The city of Wiirzburg in- 
tends to develop people’s schools according to more modern demands. 
The people’s schools of Wiirtemberg are prevented from meeting 
modern demands by their peculiar arrangement of school sessions. In 
Stuttgart only hygiene receives special attention. The reader contains 
a few instructions on the constitution of the country. 
The people’s schools of Saxony leave law and political economy to 
obligatory continuation schools. In Leipsic and Dresden sufficient 
attention is given to hygiene. In Leipsic the highest grades of ad- 
vanced and elementary schools devote a special hour to anthropology 
and hygiene. In the grade below the subject forms a part of general 
instruction in natural history. The course of study is as follows:

-P-A-G-E-480
422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
functions of the human body. Digestion and its organs, circulation of 
the blood, respiration, secretion (particularly secretions of the skin). 
In this grade the organs and their functions are treated only in so far 
as they lead to the deduction and foundation of rules of health. 
Bighth year of course.—This grade deals with the more difficult chap- 
ters of motion and sensation, a proper understanding of which leads to 
the study of the skeleton, muscles, skin, nerves, and organs of the 
special senses. Besides the structure and functions, the care of the 
organs is discussed, The chief lessons of the grade below are reviewed. 
and elaborated. In connection with digestion the more important arti- 
cles of food are discussed. Toward the end of the year a set of rules 
of hygiene are deduced from the lessons, and children are instructed 
how to assist quickly in cases of sudden sickness and accident. 
Both cities afford opportunity for instruction in manual training, 
though it is not of necessity connected with the people’s schools. Law 
and political economy are likewise adopted in the course of continua- 
tion schools in Zwickau. Manual training is taught ina private school, 
partially supported by the State and city, in 14 grades, to 224 boys, by 
9 teachers; 42 girls receive instruction in domestic economy and house- 
keeping in the cooking school connected with burgher schools. The 
course lasts fourteen weeks, and is conducted in the afternoon. 
In the people’s schools of Baden domestic economy has found ample 
consideration. In Carlsruhe alone there are 13 grades of domestic 
economy, engaging 7 female teachers. The study is pursued during the 
last two years in girls’ elementary and advanced schools. During 
geography lessons in the upper grade the natural and manufactured 
products of countries are discussed in particular; in boys’ schools those 
that are frequently met with in business intercourse, trade, and com- 
merce; in girls’ schools those used in housekeeping. The constitutions 
of Baden and the German Empire are treated under history in the 
upper grade. In Mannheim girls of the upper grade likewise receive 
instruction in cooking, given in four hours per week, as a rale during 
free afternoons. Manual training has been introduced into boys’ schools. 
The hope is entertained that this branch will soon be introduced 
into the highest grades of people’s schools. In people’s as well as in 
advanced schools instruction is given in connection with the appropri- 
ate lessons of the third part of the reader officially introduced. Mann- 
heim has advanced schools only—that is to say, every elementary schoo] 
is a fully graded one of at least eight grades. Hygiene, to which one 
hour a week is devoted in the sixth year, is a part of the study of 
natural history. 
Advanced schools in Mannheim—really advanced people’s or burgher 
schools in the sense of the law—have a thoroughly modern character. 
They are “specially designed to equip pupils in the highest degree with 
the knowledge and ability necessary for their later practical life.” In 
 
-P-A-G-E-481
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 423 
the upper grades business correspondence and single-entry bookkeep- 
ing, and in the eighth grade political economy, receive special attention. 
The advanced schools of Mannheim are the only German people’s 
schools known in which political economy forms a special branch of 
study. Instruction under the following heads is given two hours a 
week: (1) Man as an individual; (2) the family; (3) communities; (4) 
the state and its constitution; (5) labor and the accident insurance 
laws; (6) capital; (7) political economy, societies; (8) trade and com- 
merce; (9) money; (10) credit; (11) finances; (12) army and navy. 
In Hessia the course of study prescribed for people’s schools of four 
grades requires that the highest grade in history learn “the most 
important events in Hessian history with regard to political institu- 
tions and the constitution.” Natural history in the same grade treats 
of the “structure and life of the human body, and laws of health.” In 
Worms law and political economy are taught in connection with history 
and arithmetic.! 
For the last four years manual training has been taught in connec- 
tion with drawing. Since the spring of 1895 the highest grade of girls 
receive compulsory instruction in domestic economy four hours a week. 
School Inspector Scherer, of the people’s schools in Worms, advocates 
transferring domestic economy to continuation schools, but mentions 
that the practical carrying out of this plan would meet with local 
obstacles. 
Law, domestic science, hygiene, and political economy are not pre- 
scribed in Darmstadt. These studies are referred to obligatory con- 
tinuation schools and housekeeping schools, attendance in which, is 
optional. The course for schools of eight grades in Mayence intro- 
duces the regulations quoted in the foregoing plan without further 
specialization. 
In the course of study for elementary schools in the Grand Duchy of 
Saxe-Weimar’ no attention is paid to the branches under discussion. 
At the same time, in all schools “where it is necessary and practical 
the teachers must instruct the older boys in fruit-tree culture outside 
of regular lessons.” In the city of Weimar hygiene and domestic econ- 
omy (for girls) is included in natural history in the upper grades. 
Manual training has been introduced into the second burgher school. 
Instruction in horticulture is optional. 
In both Mecklenburgs none of the demands of modern life seem to 
have been considered. It must be remembered, however, that manual 
training was introduced as early as 1862 in the normal school at Neu- 
kloster. The time set aside for this branch has been gradually dimin- 
ished, owing to the reactionary tendencies which at present are brought

-P-A-G-E-482
    424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
to bear upon manual training. The teachers have no special love or 
preference for this branch.! 
The foundation for the course of study in Protestant people’s schools 
in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg contains no specialized statements. 
From the city of Oldenburg, where school commissioners and the board 
of directors regulate the studies, it is learned that in consequence of 
the course outlined law is treated of under history and geography; 
political economy, hygiene, and domestic economy under arithmetic, 
natural history, physics, and manual training. In arithmetic the laws 
pertaining to the care of the aged, infirm, and the sick are touched 
upon. 
The conditions prevalent in the principalities may be condensed in 
the following remarks. In the upper grade of boys’ free schools in the 
city of Meiningen manual training has been introduced (four hours a 
week during free afternoons). The pupils of advanced schools are 
instructed two hours a week in manual training, but attendance is 
optional. Manual training was introduced in Gotha in the fall of the 
year 1895. Instruction in domestic economy will be given in the upper 
grade of elementary schools for girls, in compliance with the prescribed. 
course. In the Grand Duchy of Altenburg none of these branches 
has received attention. Since fall of last year manual training has 
been introduced by way of experiment and as an optional study in the 
three upper grades of intermediate schools in Zerbst (Anhalt). No 
other demand has been recognized. In Lemgo (Lippe) arboriculture 
iscompulsory during the last two years. In Arolsen (Waldeck) hygiene 
is taught under the subject of natural history, as also under natural 
science and language, combined with reading. Law is partially dis- 
cussed under geography. The laws pertaining to the aged and invalids 
are treated under arithmetic in the highest grade. The same course 
is adopted in Arnstadt (Schwarzburg-Sondershausen). In Reuss 
(junior line) modern demands have received no attention. In Bremen 
hygiene is taught in the highest grade under the subject of natural 
history. The newly revised course of study for the people’s schools of 
seven grades in Hamburg prescribes anthropology and hygiene for the 
highest grade. The rest of the course takes none of the aforementioned 
demands into consideration. In Lubeck none of these studies is 
pursued. 
In Alsace and Lorraine very different conditions prevail. In Miil- 
hausen (in Alsace) housekeeping in the two upper grades is combined 
with language and female handiwork. A manual training school has 
been in existence since 1880; during the year 1894-95, 380 boys were 
instructed outside of regular school hours four hours a week. Law 
(labor laws) is discussed under arithmetic.

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 425 
The character of Austrian people’s and advanced schools has been 
already sufficiently dwelt upon. According to the law of May 14, 1869, 
the Fatherland and its constitution are to be specialized under geogra-_ 
phy and history. In language, pupils are to be familiarized with the 
form and requirements of the most important business compositions. 
In arithmetic economical, industrial, and simple mercantile calculations 
are to receive attention according to local relations and the future pur- 
suits of the pupils. Girls are to be particularly drilled in housekeeping 
calculations. The course of study for that branch states: ‘Arithmetic 
in connection with single-entry bookkeeping.” Natural history con- 
cludes with anthropology and hygiene. Physics and chemistry are also 
taught from a practical point of view. The advanced schools of Vienna 
have a very pronounced industrial character, apparent from the division 
of time in boys’ schools, in which eighteen of the thirty hours a week 
are distributed as follows: Vive to free-hand drawing; three to geometry; 
four to arithmetic and bookkeeping; four to natural science; two to 
natural history. The highest grade of community schools in Berlin, by 
way of example, allow twelve out of thirty-two hours a week for the 
stated branches collectively. 
In the people’s schools of Switzerland modern practical demands meet 
the fullest consideration in the upper grades. In the grammar schools 
of Zurich bookkeeping and hygiene, for instance, occupy a permanent 
place, as well as in Basel, where the study of the constitution is com- 
bined with history. The course of study in the southwestern cantons 
corresponds with the French throughout. 
French people’s schools adapt themselves in every way to practical 
demands. According to the law of March 28, 1882, “laws and polit- 
ical economy” must be provided for outside of lessons in morality and 
citizenship peculiar to French schools. The elements of mathematics 
and natural science are applied to agriculture, industries, and hygiene. 
Manual training is almost everywhere found in France. The course of 
study in the higher people’s school (école primaire supérieure), it seems, 
is too much subdivided. It devotes special time to the subjects of 
bookkeeping, agriculture, horticulture, political economy, and female 
handiwork under separate heads, and, moreover, mentions civil law in 
connection with history and hygiene as a part of nature study. 
English people’s schools seem to be dominated by a utilitarian spirit. 
Domestic economy receives special attention. 
Comment upon American schools is superfluous.

VII.—NORMAL SCHOOLS IN SWITZERLAND, 
INTRODUCTION, 
The annual report of the Commissioner of Education for 1891-92 
contained a statement of the history and methods of training teachers 
in central Europe, in which the normal schools of Switzerland were 
duly mentioned, but not described. The present chapter treats of them 
more fully, and enters into details which will, it is hoped, be especially 
welcomed by normal-school teachers in the United States, inasmuch as 
they offer information which will afford opportunities for comparison. 
In the years 1870 and 1875 J. J. Schlegel, specialist in historical 
sciences in St. Gall, published two works on the condition of normal 
schools in Switzerland during the years 1868-69 and 1871-72. In the 
first of these publications the subject was treated from a pedagogical 
and historical standpoint; statistics furnish the main substance for the 
second, which was called forth by Professor Kinkelin, of Basel, statis- 
tician of schools for the World’s Fair at Vienna in 1871, and formed the 
fifth section of the statistics of education in Switzerland published in 
part in 1875. A more recent presentation of the subject is contained 
in the statistics of education arranged for the Swiss Exposition in 1883 
by the author of Grob’s Yearbook and Prof. D. Hunziker, of Zurich. 
They haye classed normal schools under higher schools of the different 
cantons, and have examined normal school conditions as they actually 
existed in 1881-82. 
Partially digressing from the plan hitherto adopted in similar works, 
the following treatise, prepared from information furnished by Grob’s 
Yearbook, willrather compare than separately examine individual insti- 
tutions. A treatise on normal schools seems timely in this country, 
since in a number of American States the question of professional 
preparation for teachers has again become a subject of deliberation in 
educational and legislative bodies, and especially will information be 
welcome that comes from a sister republic. 
The questions proposed in circular letters addressed to the principals 
of Swiss normal schools were limited to organization (course of study, 
practice schools, number of hours per week, beginning and length of the 
school year, boarding schools), teachers (number, appointment, salary, 
supervision), students (number, age, preparatory education, terms, 
scholarships, free tuition, absences, unions, graduation), and the receipts 
and expenditures during the year 1890. 
An answer of some kind was received within six or eight weeks from 
every one of the thirty-six authorities consulted. 
The greater number of normal schools in Switzerland owe their 
foundation to the general movement which, in the third decade of the 
present century, pervaded Switzerland in favor of better education in

general. Only one of these schools dates back to the last century, and 
one to the second decade of the present century. The following list

The cantons of Neufchatel and Geneva haye never had real normal 
schools, but have arranged special divisions in the secondary schools 
for the training of teachers. 
In Switzerland there are at present 37 educational institutions 
devoted, either exclusively or in one of their divisions, to the training 
of teachers; 22 of these belong to German, 13 to French, and 2 to Ital- 
ian Switzerland. In reference to sex, there are 13 female and 23 male 
normal schools and 1 mixed normal school. 
I, ORGANIZATION. 
(1) General remarks.—Two groups of normal schools may be distin- 
guished according to the plan of organization. 
The first is closely allied with the cantonal secondary schools. 
Future teachers receive their general and scientific education in com- 
mon with younger pupils who are qualifying to enter a university or a 
higher technological school, or completing their preparation for prac- 
tical life with a secondary school education (Zug, Soleure, Chur,
-P-A-G-E-486
  428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Schiers, Neufchatel, Geneva). For a general preparation lower or pre- 
paratory grades are arranged. Still, most pupils of the pedagogical 
section are not advanced from the lower grades of the institute itself, 
but come from the general people’s and grammar schools throughout 
the State. Normal schools for women, as a rule, do not educate teach- 
ers exclusively, but are either closely or distantly connected with higher 
female schools, which begin where grammar schools leave off, and aim 
at a general education (Zurich, Berne (2), Ingenbohl, Menzingen, Fri- 
bourg, Aarau, Neufchatel, Geneva). Of late years one of these insti- 
tutions (Zurich) has partially assumed the character of a classical high 
school, so that pupils who wish to prepare for admission to a university 
pursue particular courses as necessity dictates. Because of its organi- 
zation another (Fribourg) may be styled a female normal school ‘in 
embryo,” as it contains but 2 grammar and 2 normal grades, and dis- 
misses pupils at so early an age that they can hardly be fully equipped 
for directing a school. 
The second group embraces about two-thirds of all normal schools. 
Allied with common elementary or grammar schools, they are exclu- 
sively concerned in the education of teachers whom they fit out in a 
shorter or longer time to be excellent conductors of primary schools. 
Several among them have preparatory grades (Rickenbach, Schiers, 
Peseux). The larger cantons are at present again publicly discussing 
the question whether the first or second of these groups tends most 
toward practical results (Zurich, Berne, Aarau).. Two normal schools 
for men have very recently gone over from the latter to the former 
group (Zug, 1887; Soleure, 1888). 
If the settlement of this question devolved upon teachers, it would 
long since have been effected in Zurich by the decision to combine the 
normal school with the cantonal secondary schools, or perhaps by satis- 
fying the simultaneous demand for appropriate arrangements for special 
professional education at a particular institution or at the university. 
In Aargau a large majority of teachers have taken a similar stand- 
point. In repeated petitions to the Federal Legislature or Council they 
have expressed the wish that normal schools be transferred to the capi- 
tal, and that their general scientific sections be combined with the can- 
tonal intermediate schools. Recently a new petition for the purpose 
has, by instigation of the government councilor, been set aside by the 
Federal Council, but the question can hardly rest until the wishes 
expressed have met with some kind of recognition. 
The plan of separating the sexes, formerly general, has been disre- 
garded by the State normal school in Kussnacht (Zurich), which for the 
last twenty years (since 1873) has admitted girls. After completing a 
four years’ course in common with boys, girls are allowed to take the 
saine test examination. The greater number afterwards teach in ele- 
mentary schools for both sexes. 
(2) Age of admission.—It is very gratifying to notice that those 
destined to be teachers are not allowed to undertake their difficult
-P-A-G-E-487
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 429 
task too early in life. The greater number of normal schools require 
completion of the fifteenth year before entrance. Others prescribe 
the sixteenth year: Zug, Thurgovie, Vaud, Neufchatel (male), Geneva 
(female). The normal school for women of Neufchatel does not admit 
pupils under 17 years of age. In this respect conditions are not so 
uniform as they appear in the statistical tables. Here and there the 
regulations are rather undecided, and admit of different interpreta- 
tions. As a rule, nearly all exceptions are in favor of admitting older 
and not younger pupils than the regulations prescribe. The general 
view seems to be that teachers should not enter into practical service 
until they have completed their twentieth year. 
(3) Preparation.—Normal schools that admit students whose knowl- 
edge and ability are not above what an elementary school affords are 
lessening in number year by year. Even when regulations do not 
demand a higher preparation a gratifying number of pupils, when 
admitted, have a more or less complete grammar-school education 
(Berne, Schwyz, Fribourg, Grisons, Ticino, Vaud, Valais). 
The following is an extract from the annual report (covering the 
period from 1884 to 1888) of the directors of the normal school at 
Hofwyl: 
About two-thirds of the new students are pupils of advanced and one-third of 
simple elementary schools, As examinations are arranged by rule according to the 
elementary school course of study, they can be passed by capable and well-prepared 
pupils of elementary schools. Good pupils of advanced schools, however, continue 
to have a decided advantage during the course. The question forces itself upon us 
more and more whether one of the conditions of admission should not be a uniform 
preparatory education which would be a sure foundation for a normal course. 
(Martig.) 
It seems that private normal schools pay particular attention to this 
point. Even in those cantons where legal regulations define the course 
of an elementary school as sufficient private normal schools take the 
precaution of replacing attendance at a grammar school either by pre- 
paratory instruction or the support of excellent candidates, so that 
newly admitted pupils, as soon as possible, attain a certain uniform 
level, and can without further drawbacks apply themselves to prepar- 
ing for examination. They recognize a thorough preparation of their 
students as the chief means of being able to compete successfully with 
the State normal schools. 
Normal schools for men frequently receive students who, actuated by 
zeal and a free resolve, decide upon teaching as their vocation only 
after they have entered upon practical life. Such usually are sensibly 
deficient in knowledge; but the earnestness and zeal which they devote 
to their self-chosen calling advance them to the first rank. It is most 
gratifying to notice that teachers are supplied from all parts of the 
country. If we examine the lists of twenty admitted pupils according 
to the places where they have received their first schooling, we find 
represented all places, large and small, mountains and valleys, city and 
country, even to the most insignificant and forlorn villages.

  430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
(4) Beginning and length of cowrge—The number of years required 
for the education of male and female teachers ranges from one to four. 
There are 10 institutions with four, 2 with three and one-half, 18 with 
three, 5 with two years courses, and 2 with a one-year course. The 
inequality seems somewhat less striking when we consider that of the 
18 normal schools with a three years course 4 prescribe the completion 
of the sixteenth year, and that 1, the female normal school in Neufchatel 
(pedagogical section of the cantonal gymnasium), admits pupils only 
after the seventeenth year is completed. The standard by which a 
teacher’s education is measured seems to vary as much as the valuation 
of that knowledge and ability which the common schools afford to 
children entering upon practical life, or the estimation placed upon the 
worth of people’s-school teachers in general. 
Within the last ten years there has been an evident effort in several 
cantons toward shortening the time of instruction in normal schools. 
So far they have been unsuccessful. In the Canton of Berne the 
extension of time from a three to a four years course for the State 
normal school in Hofwyl, decided upon in 1880, could not be carried 
into effect. Under the pressure of a temporary want of teachers the 
grade referred to was, in the fall of 1883, admitted to the examination 
for diploma, whereupon the decision rendered by the government coun- 
cilor on the 30th of January made the three-and-one-half-years course 
permanent. In his annual report the principal expresses the regret that 
the four years course which the teachers attempted to introduce failed 
of success. In the Canton of Aargau an effort was made to abolish the 
fourth (highest) grade at the State normal school in Wettingen and 
limit the course to three years; but this, so far, has met with too 
ardent an opposition from teachers and authorities. The most recent 
efforts tend toward extending the course of study at the female normal 
school in Aarau to four years, to correspond with that of the State 
normal school. 
In the Canton of Zurich the advocates in favor of shortening the 
course have received no attention. 
In Thurgovie, on the other hand, repeated efforts have been made to 
extend the three years course for elementary-school teachers to four 
years. In 1873, however, the project countenanced by the government 
was not favored by popular vote. In 1882 normal-school teachers 
advanced a new idea. With the introduction of the fourth course (so 
reads their memorial) there would come a year in which no students 
would be graduated; as a consequent result there would be a better 
adjustment between the number of unengaged teachers and vacancies 
to be filled. Students who now leave at the end of three years without 
receiving appointments would be better cared for by the fourth year’s 
course; at the same time the schools would be greatly benefited. The 
demands upon a normal school education so increase from year to year 
that they can hardly be satisfactorily complied with in three years.
-P-A-G-E-489
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 431 
The extension of normal-school courses has recently been agitated in 
other cantons; in Berne, for instance, it has been successfully carried 
out. The authorities have thought best to defer all further mention of 
the former project “until the question of carrying the twenty-seventh 
article of the constitution, concerning the province of federal legislation, 
into effect had been to some extent cleared.” 
y* Twenty normal schools open in spring (April or May); 17 in the fall 
(September or October). South, west, and middle Switzerland usually 
adopt the latter custom; the customs of Berne, Schwyz, and Vaud 
follow east Switzerland in this respect. The State normal school of 
Grisons opens in the fall; the private normal school of Schiers, together 
with the other normal schools of east Switzerland, in the spring. The 
normal school of Hofwy] (Berne) stands alone in admitting new pupils 
in the spring, but reckoning the school year from fall to fall, the first 
is therefore only a half-year course. 
A ten-weeks vacation is fairly uniform. Only two normal schools 
(Kreuzlingen and Unterstrass) allow less time, nine weeks. Soleure 
and Muristalden have eleven; Hitzkirch, Locarno, Sitten, Brieg, each 
twelve weeks’ vacation. The last three open in October and continue 
uninterruptedly to July, so that there are nine months of school and 
three of vacation. As these institutions are boarding schools, students 
spend their vacation at home; in case of remaining at the institution 
they are charged an extra fee for the length of time they stay. At 
other schools, as a rule, the vacation is so divided that two weeks come 
in spring, four in summer, and two in autumn. Generally there is no 
instruction between Christmas and New Year. In Valais, at the begin- 
ening of the school year in September, two monthly courses of review 
are conducted by already appointed male and female teachers. In this 
ease the lower grades have vacation till the 1st of November, while 
the upper grades begin on the 1st of September. 
(5) Studies—(a) General education—Two to four hours a week are 
devoted to religious instruction throughout the course. The normal 
schools of Kussnacht and Zurich limit this study to biblical history. 
The course of study in the public schools of Neufchatel and Geneva 
do not include religious instruction, which is left to the family and reli- 
- gious societies. Several normal schools (Hindelbank, Berne [new female 
school], Muristalden) teach the method of religious instruction com- 
bined with practical exercises. Private normal schools make a point 
of differing from the public by devoting more time to religion. 
Language, to which from five to ten hours a week are devoted 
through the entire course, is a prominent study in all normal schools. 
The vernacular receives more attention throughout French and Italian 
than in German Switzerland, where natural science and mathematics 
rank as equally important or, in some cases, higher if measured by the 
amount of time devoted to it. Foreign languages, on the other hand, 
are generally more earnestly studied in German than in French normal
-P-A-G-E-490
  432 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
schools. All, excepting the male normal school in Hauterive and the 
female in Lausanne, teach a second language; German and Italian 
schools, French; and French schools, German. The male normal school 
in Locarno teaches German as a second foreign language, which is an 
optional study. 
The pedagogical section for teachers at the College of Geneva is 
exceptional in reference to foreign languages. The course of study in 
this institution allows throughout the four-years course more hours a 
week to German (five) than to French (four). This is not altogether 
due to the fact that a law recently passed in the canton requires Ger- 
man to be taught in elementary schools. Young teachers who, owing 
to the small area of the Canton of Geneva, are sometimes necessitated 
to look for employment in other cantons and abroad can more easily 
obtain positions if they have a better knowledge of German. 
Italian forms a part of the curriculum in the female normal schools of 
Menzingen and Aarau and the male normal school of Schiers, but is 
studied rather by students who do not intend to be teachers. English 
is an optional study at 2 male normal schools (Kussnacht, Schiers) and 
at 6 female normal schools (Zurich, Berne (2), Menzingen, Fribourg, 
Aarau). 
Latin is an optional study at the male normal schools of Kussnacht 
and Zurich, at which latter institute it is taken up by students intend- 
ing to enter the university. The importance of this study for future 
teachers is shown in the following remarks of the director of the 
college at Geneva: 
I often receive applications for teachers from foreigners with the request not to 
recommend anyone unable to teach Latin. Now our pedagogical section makes no‘ 
mention of this language in its curriculum; when I show the results of graduates’ 
examinations I am told that the young gentlemen are not sufficiently prepared. Con- 
sequently nothing is left for these young men but to follow the career of an elemen- 
tary-school teacher. 
The time devoted to mathematics is very unequally distributed in 
different normal schools. The average number of hours a week during 
the course varies between three (Neufchatel, female pedagogical sec- 
tion) and five and one-half (Kussnacht). As a rule, male normal 
schools devote more tine to this branch than female. The female 
normal school at Zurich, the only exception in this respect, must con- 
form to the State normal school for men at Kussnacht, owing to the 
fact of having the same test examination in everything but surveying. 
First in order, according to the number of hours employed for mathe- 
matics, are the normal schools of Kussnacht (twenty-two), Unterstrass 
(twenty-one), Zurich, Soleure, and Wettingen, each twenty, with a four- 
years course each; the least time devoted to the study of mathematics is 
by the female normal schools of Fribourg and Lausanne (nine), Locarno 
(eight), Geneva (two), Neufchatel (three), and the male normal school 
of Neufchatel (eight). Keeping accounts and bookkeeping are also  
-P-A-G-E-491
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 433 
included in mathematics, sometimes forming a special branch, as in the 
male normal institutes of Ingenbohl, Menzingen, Hauterive, Fribourg, 
Kreuzlingen, Locarno, Neufchatel, Geneva, and Peseux, and sometimes 
combined with other studies, as in Hitzkirch with arithmetic and in 
Muristalden with writing. A certain number of schools do not advance 
this study beyond the standard of a first-class elementary school; 
others, again, in this respect assume the character of actual secondary 
schools by facilitating a promotion into the university. 
Natural science is entirely neglected in the female normal schools of 
Valais, and varies in importance in other institutions. The male nor- 
mal school in Kussnacht (twenty hours) and the pedagogical section 
of the college in Geneva (eighteen hours) rank foremost in reference 
to the number of lessons in this branch. They are followed by the 
female normal school in Zurich and the male normal school in Wet- 
tingen (seventeen hours). Only the male normal schools of Kussnacht, 
Zurich, Hofwyl, and Geneva have a laboratory where pupils can make 
experiments, and manipulate at least the most important physical 
and chemical apparatus. More modest arrangements are elsewhere 
provided. 
In some places hygiene forms a special branch of natural science 
(Hauterive, Locarno, Lausanne, and Geneva); in others it is appropri- 
ately combined with other sciences (Kussnacht, Zurich, and Schiers). 
Agriculture is likewise pursued in several normal schools, as, for 
instance, in Hitzkirch, Hofwyl, Delemont, Muristalden, Hauterive, Zug 
(fruit-tree culture), Soleure, Rorschach, Chur, Wettingen, and Sitten. 
Theoretical instruction in agriculture is generally combined with prac- 
tical exercises in gardens and fields. Pupils are interested in agricul- 
ture at the normal schools of Hofwyl, Pruntrut, Muristalden, Ricken- 
bach, Zug, Hauterive, Rorschach, Chur, Wettingen, Kreuzlingen, and 
Sitten. At the male normal schools of Valais natural science consists 
in instruction in agriculture and cattle raising (meadow culture, grow- 
ing vegetables and fruit, culture of useful plants, cattle raising, dairy 
work, etc.). 
The same amount of attention is universally given to history and 
geography. The number of lessons a week in these branches show no 
such important differences as in nature study. Most courses of study 
include three lessons a week for history and two for geography. Where 
mathematical and physical geography form special branches the for- 
mer is occasionally included in mathematics; the latter in nature 
study. The history and geography of Switzerland naturally receive 
the greatest attention. 
In the male normal schools of west Switzerland civics (instruction 
civique) is treated as a separate study; in German normal schools for 
men the study of Fatherland, law, and constitution are united with his- 
tory and geography, or connected with the latter as a concluding chap- 
ter (Kussnacht, Hofwyl, Rickenbach, Hitzkirch, Wettingen). A study 
of the federal constitution has been expressly introduced into some
-P-A-G-E-492
  434 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
courses as a-compulsory study. We sometimes hear that the curriculum 
of normal schools for men, like secondary schools, includes the study 
of civic relations; but because of “lack of time” this knowledge is in 
reality left to be self-acquired in practical life. The fact is being better 
understood every day that the main thing to be considered in teaching 
history and geography is not mere memorizing of names, dates, and 
numbers, but a proper understanding and appreciation of the events 
themselves and, in particular, the important movements in the history 
of civilization. : 
Singing occupies a prominent place in all normal schools, having 
as many as 5 lessons a week. Instrumental music is not taught at all 
in 9 female normal schools (Berne (2), Aarau, Locarno, Lausanne, 
Brieg, Sitten, Neufchatel, and Geneva); in two institutions (the female 
school in Fribourg and the male normal school of Locarno) it is an 
optional branch. At the other normal schools, as a rule, one instru- 
ment, with 2 lessons a week, is obligatory, and a second optional. 
The violin is the most popular instrument, followed by the organ, piano, 
harmonium, and cithern. The latter is taught in several normal board- 
ing schools for young wonien. 
Drawing is taught in all normal schools at least two hours a week. 
Kussnacht, Unterstrass, and Soleure lead, with 12 lessons a week each; 
Lausanne (male teachers) numbers 11, Zurich (female teachers) 10 les- 
sons a week. Other institutions are giving increased attention to 
drawing, as its value in manual training and industrial pursuits is being 
more generally recognized. 
Penmanship receives very different degrees of attention. Some 
schools have but a one-year course, with 1 lesson (Zurich, Locarno, 
and Geneva); others combine it with bookkeeping (Pruntrut); others 
again devote to it as many as 7 lessons a week (Rickenbach, Lausanne 
(for men), and Menzingen). 
Gymnastics are under federal supervision. The cantonal board of 
school directors were formerly required to hand in, after every inspec- 
tion, a statistical report, nade out according to a given scheme, which 
has since been exacted by the military department of Switzerland at 
least once a year. The cause of gymnastics will hardly be promoted in 
normal schools until the military preparation in the cantons is sub- 
stantially supported by the Federation in word and deed. Federal 
supervision, however, draws the attention of the cantons at least once 
a year to this department. The number of lessons a week is much 
more uniform than in most other branches (2). 
Several normal schools for women have as yet not adopted gymnastics 
into the regular course (Brieg, Sitten, Ingenbohl, and Menzingen). 
Where male normal schools are divisions of secondary schools (Chur, 
Soleure) the students participate in the military exercises. 
Manual training for boys has lately begun to be introduced into. all 
normal schools in which handicraft is pursued independent of agricul-
-P-A-G-E-493
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 435 
ture (Hofwyl, Pruntrut, Muristalden, Locarno, Lausanne, Neufehatel, 
and Geneva). It is taught mostly in the upper grades in 2 to 4 les- 
sons a week, and promises to pave its own way into general people’s or 
elementary schools. 
As a rule, the theory of housekeeping is combined with female handi- 
work, to which all normal schools, excepting those of Zurich and Aarau, 
devote from 3 to 4 lessons a week. There still exist a few traces of 
the arrangement formerly in vogue of teaching French, for instance, 
simultaneously with female handiwork. In the female school in Fri- 
bourg cooking, ironing, and garment cutting are taught, in addition to 
the usual female handiwork of knitting, sewing, and embroidering. 
(b) Professional education.—For various reasons most normal schools 
do not qualify future teachers for their vocation as well as might be 
desired. In the first place, the time allowed for training pupils is too 
short for them to acquire more than a certain elementary knowledge of 
the general subject-matter of instruction; a thorough drill in the prac- 
tical part of teaching is not permissible. In the second place, candi- 
dates while in attendance at school are too young to appreciate and 
apply the studies of psychology and didactics. The matter is in itself 
so difficult that even normal-school teachers are not always its exact 
interpreters. Finally, the inadequacy of existing arrangements for 
practical exercises prevents the desired success. The schemes sub- 
mitted to the authorities referred particularly to existing provisions 
for the promotion of practical pedagogy. Because of the importance 
of the subject, the following analyses of the minutiz of the information 
received may be welcome. 
Usually two hours a week for one to two years are devoted to gen- 
eral pedagogy. In this assignment of time no essential differences in 
the various institutions are shown. The history of education offers no 
occasion for comment. In some schools it follows, in others it precedes 
general pedagogy. In some the subject is presented from the earliest 
times to the present, in others character sketches are drawn, combined 
with the reading of modern pedagogical works (i. e., Lienhard und 
Gertrud). Theoretical didactics is either connected with all the studies , 
or treated as a separate special branch. With reference to language, 
arithmetic, and singing, the teachers of practice schools or specialists 
comment on the methods of teaching as occasions present themselves. 
General pedagogy and methods are usually taught by different teach- 
ers. The normal school for men in Kussnacht is an exception in this 
respect; of late years the same arrangement prevails that was in vogue 
at the opening of the institution fifty years ago. These two studies 
have been so combined that pedagogy is taught by the instructor of 
methods or didactics. As the latter is at the same time the director of 
the practice school, he is in that capacity partly represented by a capa- 
ble young teacher. Thus it is hoped to deepen the knowledge of 
methods by means of the science of pedagogy and to make pedagogy 
more practical and fruitful by means of the study of methods.
-P-A-G-E-494
    436 SDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95, 
The ways in which future teachers are initiated in the practical pur- 
suit of their calling are manifold, and yet to some degree uniform. 
Candidates for the position of teacher are obliged to attend a school, 
first to notice and listen, then to take an active part, first in one, later 
in several grades, and finally te discuss their experiences and observa- 
tions under competent directors, by whom their attention is drawn to 
deficiencies and mistakes. They are also required to write out peda- 
gogical exercises and study works on methods of teaching. 
Practice schools corresponding to the schools in which teachers are 
later engaged are combined with most normal institutions. The want 
of such an arrangement is regarded as a deplorable deficiency, and 
earnest efforts are made to supply the want. Candidates can, itis true, 
attend a few public schools and sections for observation and attention, 
but they have no opportunity for practicing where a practice school is 
not in organic connection with the normal school. 
The following examples of professional preparation at normal schools 
will explain the above conditions better: 
Pupils of the highest grade receive 3 lessons a week in the theory of general and 
special didactics or methods, and are made acquainted with the means of instruc- 
tion obligatory in people’s schools. Besides, every three days they take turns in 
visiting practice schools, where they have occasion to participate in teaching. In 
addition, each one for two or three weeks conducts a certain study in a single 
grade, and in conclusion undertakes the direction of the entire school. (Kussnacht.) 
In the third (next to the highest) grade young ladies receive 2 lessons a week 
in special methods, are made acquainted with the means of instruction, and begin 
with practice lessons. General methodology, special methods of teaching, and the 
study of schools are taught in the fourth or highest grade. Practice lessons, con- 
ducted at times by teachers and at times by students, and visits to the different 
grades of city primary and grammar schools, combined with practical exercises, 
inculcate the knowledge of conducting schools. Every student has the benefit of 
a two-weeks attendance at the elementary, historical, and scientific sections of 
practice schools. (Zurich.) 
Every student of the senior grade gives a weck’s attention in practice schools, 
and teaches a few lessons; the second week he conducts the school under the teach- 
er’s direction and supervision. Each one of two senior students conducts one lesson 
a week, in which preparation and application of methods are discussed. (Unter- 
strass.) 
The 5 primary schools of the town of Munchenbuchsee are practice schools. In 
next to the last year’s course one houra week is devoted to visiting primary schools; 
in the last course three hours a week are spent in visiting intermediate and high 
schools; one hour a week is given to criticism and the discussion of lessons. Where 
it is considered necessary, teachers of practice schools assign model lessons on a 
given subject as a practical exercise for the pupils whose treatment is subsequently 
discussed. (Hofwyl.) 
Pedagogy includes general methodology and the method of teaching language 
with practical exercises. The methods of other branches in the course of study are 
taught by different teachers. The pupils of both upper grades are called upon in 
turn to teach in practice schools. The senior class is by degrees employed in direct- 
ing every grade of the school. They keep a journal in which they note all the 
details of their doings and the observations made. The teacher in charge of the 
practice school supplements his remarks on the aptitude of the pupils from the  
-P-A-G-E-495
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 437 
standpoint of discipline and pedagogy. Being in accord with specialists and the 
teacher of pedagogy, he is commissioned to give pupils all necessary practical direc- 
tions. Explanation and criticism of practice-school journals take up part of the 
time devoted to methodology. (Principal Perrentruy.) 
Practice in teaching, most closely united with the science of pedagogy, is effected 
by model lessons, visits to schools, trial lessons, and practical exercises in normal 
and practice schools. (Hindelbank.) 
In winter every senior student, at least for a " whole week at a time, acts as 
assistant in a grade assigned by the model teacher, by whom he is thoroughly drilled 
in management and discipline. In order that the schools suffer as little as possible 
from having too many teachers and from the inexperience of normal school students 
the latter are obliged to make very exact and uniform preparations. ~ This is accom- 
plished by instruction in methods and accompanying exercises, lectures, and 
criticism. The students write out their preparations in a copy book, which is sub- 
mitted to the teacher for examination and approval. (Organization of the normal 
school at Muristalden, Bern.) 
Three divisions are distinguished in practical pedagogy. In the first, young ladies 
listen to a model lesson conducted by the class teacher; in the second, they repeat a 
prearranged trial lesson; and in the third, entirely conduct a lesson on a given theme. 
Every week the whole senior class spends half a day in a city school, where it sepa- 
rates, so that each student has the benefit of the above-mentioned practice in all of 
the five grades of the practice school. Criticism on the manner in which tkese 
practice lessons have been conducted follows in the lessons on methods. (Bern, 
new female school.) 
During the last two years of the course students have exercise at practice schools 
under the supervision of the teacher in charge of said schools, They attend two 
by two during three consecutive days, so that each pupil has a turn about once in 
seven weeks. Practice schools are communal primary schools attended by children 
of the first three years (6 to 9 years of age); normal-school students teach alter- 
nately in each section. (Delemont.) 
The third year’s class has four hours a week practice in the German preparatory 
school connected with the institution. This school consists of the three divisions 
corresponding to the higher courses of the primary school, and is conducted by a 
class teacher. The normal-school teacher informs every student of the subject-mat- 
ter afew days beforehand. While he is conducting the lesson the normal-school 
class is present and takes notes. A general discussion. follows. The students 
express their opinion on teacher, mode of teaching, language, position, discipline, 
etc. The class teacher then rectifies the remarks made and deduces his own con- 
clusions, giving hints for the future. The class teacher is in closest sympathy with 
the teacher of methods, who is also inspector of practice schools. (Zug.) 
Students of the third year, during the second half, and those of the fourth year, 
during the first half of the scholastic year, spend half a day every week together at 
the model school, where they pay attention to special methods and model lessons 
and engage in actual practice in the teacher’s presence. In order to acquire the 
necessary skill in management they visit the model school alternately, one by one, 
on one or more days, either to observe and listen or to be actively employed. 
(Soleure.) 
In connection with preparations and criticisms on their practice in teaching the 
senior students are instructed by the teacher of practice schools in the methods of 
the separate studies of people’s schools, After grades and studies have been arranged 
in the beginning of the first semester, every student must for two or three weeks 
attend occasional lectures, whereupon his practical studies begin. Grades and 
studies are changed in the second semester. Preparations are discussed and criti- 
cised in their application. The presence of other students at keeping school is 
compulsory. The teacher of pedagogy devotes an extra hour once a week to the
-P-A-G-E-496
  438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
discussion of the trial lessons and the experiments and observations made at the 
normal school. (Chur.) 
After students of the second year have become acquainted with pedagogical writ- 
ings during one semester, have studied the subjects of imagination, emotion, and 
‘volition in psychology, as well as the methods of different school studies in general, 
and have made preparations for every branch pursued in the upper grades (fourth 
to the sixth elementary school year) they are introduced into practical teaching by 
the instructor of methods. The preparation of a study is assigned to every student, 
with whom it is then discussed; if considered good, it is carried out in the class 
room under the teacher’s direction. After a student has worked at a branch for five 
or six weeks a new programme is arranged; the studies are so changed that every 
student has some practice in the most important branches. In the third grade a 
similar plan is adopted, the only difference being that students from the beginning 
are actively employed in teaching at the model school, and as capacity permits, are 
allowed to teach in primary grades (first to the third school year). (Schiers.) 
The practice-school teacher also instructs the students in special methods. From 
the third (next to the highest) grade on students are required to visit practice 
schools and conduct trial lessons. On a one-session day of three hours senior stu- 
dents alternately take entire charge of the classes in the teacher’s presence, so that 
they gradually become acquainted with the complete working of schools of eight 
grades. Discussions are combined with practice. (Wettingen.) 
In the first quarter of the third (highest) grade young ladies begin to practice in 
their own class. From the second quarter on their practice extends to city primary 
schools, beginning @ith the lowest grade. The practical exercises are concluded in 
the divisions of schools of two grades. Men and women teachers assist thronghout 
by giving necessary practical hints. The teacher of pedagogy conducts practice 
lessons with the young ladies in the different divisions.. This is better than the 
former arrangement, when in one afternoon a large body of children participated in 
one trial lesson. But normal-school principals do not consider the frequent chang- 
ing from one division to another and from teacher to teacher the best preparation 
for teachers. They are endeavoring to arrange a true practice school in connection 
with the three lowest grades at least. As most women teachers are engaged in 
primary schools, practice in these grades would be sufficient. (Aarau.) 
After the organization of people’s schools has been discussed in class the second- 
grade students, during the second half year, visit practice schools for a day at a 
time as quiet observers; a minute report of their observations is handed in to the 
teacher of pedagogy. In summer, just as in winter, students of the third year spend 
their time in listening and observing, assisting in the correction of written tasks, 
and after a progressive preparation giving oral instruction in the different branches 
and grades. They are under the supervision and direction of practice teachers, to 
whom they hand written preparations, and with whom faults and errors are dis- 
cussed. A written report of their observations and experiences must he handed to 
the teacher of pedagogy. 
From time to time the whole third grade assists at the instruction of practice 
teachers in presence of the professor of pedagogy and, as circumstances permit, the 
observations made are discussed. In winter the different grades of elementary 
schools assemble once a week at the normal school, the students of which by turns 
conduct lessons, for which all must prepare. A free criticism follows between direct- 
ors and pupils. Occasionally other schools are visited. (Kreuzlingen.) 
We have as yet no model school; we shall have one next year. (Locarno.) 
A professional and practical education is acquired at practice schools. Students 
of the senior class go there by turns, so as to participate in all the lessons. 
(Lausanne. ) 
In the absence of practice schools, those who wish to be teachers have the oppor- 
tunity several times a year of attending lectures and conducting practice lessons at 
the primary schools of Sitten. (Sitten.)
-P-A-G-E-497
  ‘EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 439 
Students of the first year (lower grade) devote one hour and those of the second 
year turee hours to practical exercises in the elementary city schools. (Neufchatel.) 
Students are practically engaged at model schools, first, as monitors in charge of 
classes during recreation and walks, as an exercise in disciplining; after that, as 
assistants under the direction of the presiding teacher; and lastly, as class teachers, 
preparing their instructions in writing and teaching in the presence of the principal, 
presiding teacher, and classmates. The lessons are subsequently criticised by all. 
(Peseux.) 
After leaving school young teachers are on probation for an indefinite time. This 
arrangement of teaching under the direction of a teacher, even after leaving tho 
normal school, prevails also in the Canton of Fribourg. The probationer receives no 
definite appointment, and in some cases only very small pay. (Regulations of 
Geneva.) : 
The normal courses obligatory for students of the first year include all the studies 
of elementary education (object lessons, language, geography, arithmetic). Practi- 
cal exercises are combined with the theoretical normal courses. Under their teacher's 
direction normal-school students teach in the different grades of primary schools, 
especially language and all its branches, arithmetic, elementary geometry, and 
geography. (Women teachers of Geneva.) 
We have amply considered different models of arrangements for the 
practical education of teachers, from the modest beginning of occa- 
sional attendance at lectures in school to methodical direction and indi- 
vidual exercise in model or practice schools. The difficulty of giving 
each normal-school student the greatest possible amount of practice 
still remains. 
(c) Number of lessons per week.—The total number of lessons per 
week in the normal schools of Switzerland is very considerable. While 
the effort to keep the standard of obligatory studies moderately high is 
perceptible, optional studies are made so attractive that zealous stu- 
dents eager for knowledge, as a rule, devote considerable time to them. 
The normal school for women of Geneva has the least number of les- 
sons per week, 25; the normal schools for women of Sitten and Brieg 
have the most, 46. The lower extreme is an isolated case, and the 
larger is approached by many other institutions; the average is 38 les- 
sons per week; all others number over 30, and nearly half 40 lessons 
and more. When we consider that 19 normal schools have optional 
studies, and employ a large number of specialists, who do not always 
confiné the private tasks of pupils within prudent measure, we must 
confess that the number of lessons per week for future teachers is 
uncommonly large, generally even to excess. In revising the courses 
of study judicious omissions will have to be made. 
It is more difficult to reduce the number of studies in normal schools 
than in other higher educational institutions. When any branch of 
knowledge has developed into a special study to which a more general 
significance is attributed, its introduction into normal schools is advo- 
cated clamorously. In case any pedagogical thought has made more or 
less progress in the public consciousness, normal schools are at once 
called upon for a practical test. Teachers themselves are the most 
persistent in this, because they preeminently feel the necessity of 
 
-P-A-G-E-498
  
  440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
continuous improvement in normal-school education. In addition to 
these outward influences the general difficulties are further aggravated 
by the persons (specialists and authorities) upon whom such a revision 
devolves. Each one is so convinced of the great importance of a special 
branch that he strains every nerve to insure it a correspondingly large 
amount of time. 
All the good genii of youth will have to muster their forces to pre- 
vent a heavier burden of lessons, which is more likely to result from 
revising the course of study than the intended reduction of studies. 
Il. BOARDING SCHOOLS. 
Twenty-four of the 37 normal schools accommodate boarders. Nine 
for women, 3 for men, and 1 mixed normal school, 13 in all, do not take 
boarders. All private normal schools are boarding schools. The dor- 
mitories opened in the spring of 1840 at the male normal school of 
Kussnacht, in Zurich, were closed conditionally in the summer of 1875, 
and have not since been opened. The male normal school in Locarno 
has accommodated boarders only since 1889. 
Dormitories have an economical as well as educational purpose. 
Their favorable educational influence on future school-teachers has 
lately been most emphatically contested. The discipline and seclusion 
of a convent are not considered an appropriate preparation for the 
later position of teachers among the people. The characteristics 
developed by boarding schools are calculated to estrange teachers 
from the people and the young, and increase the difficulties of their 
professional practice, whereas continual contact with the world insures 
self-reliance and preservation from educational prejudices. On the 
other hand, it is maintained that boarding-school discipline, rather 
than the enjoyment of unlimited freedom at so young an age, tends to 
preserve young men from dangerous excesses. The economical side of 
the question deserves to be the more earnestly considered, as teachers 
are in Switzerland largely supplied from the lower strata of society, 
with whom the cost of several years’ residence away from home 
becomes a question of actual existence. By granting sufficient scholar- 
ships capable young men can study for the profession of teaching 
without the necessity of boarding schools. According to experiences 
in the Canton of Zurich, it would be a mistake to believe that boarding 
schools are attended with more expense to the State than day schools 
with increased scholarships. After closing the boarding department 
of the normal school in Kussnacht the average yearly expenses per 
pupil did not increase to the anticipated amount (1874, 510 franes; 
1875, 550 franes; 1876, 550 francs; 1877, 580 francs; 1878, 570 francs). 
The daily routine of boarding schools is nearly everywhere the same, 
In summer pupils rise at 5 o’clock; in winter at 6. Personal work 
then begins. Morning prayer and breakfast between 6.30 and 7.30, 
class work from 7 or 8 to 12, dinner at 12, outdoor work or gymnastics
-P-A-G-E-499
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 441 
at 12.30, class from 2 to 5; then afternoon collation, with a short recre- 
ation; outdoor work from 7 to 8; then supper, followed by indoor work 
until 9; evening prayer, and retiring for the night. This is the daily 
order of thé different boarding schools, which is identical with that 
followed out in all normal schools for men. Where agricultural labor 
is pursued field and garden work offer an agreeable change of occupa- 
tion after dinner or evening classes. 
In some schools students are obliged to assist in preparing meals, 
splitting wood, etc., and engage in general housework, as sweeping the 
rooms, stairs, halls, etc., setting and clearing off the table, caring for 
the lamps, attending to the stoves, ete. (Hofwyl). In this case a part 
of the servants’ work devolves upon pupils, to keep down expenses. 
Several normal schools have recently introduced manual training, which 
will gradually displace the less educational lhousework. 
Boarding is usually compulsory; day students are admitted only: 
where there is lack of room. In Hofwy] senior students live in private 
boarding houses. In Chur boarding at schools is optional. Present 
accommodations are hardly sufficient for half of the students; the other 
half are partly accommodated in boarding houses and partly in the 
boarding department of the cantonal school. 
In the normal school of the Canton of Thurgovie, in Kreuzlingen, a 
petition of the teachers to make boarding optional was not granted. 
As arule a number of pupils live together in study halls and dormi- 
tories. At the normal school of the Canton of Aargau, in Wettingen, 
the room system is carried out; 49 rooms of different sizes are at the 
pupils’ disposal; at present each room is occupied by one or two pupils. 
In the normal school of St. Gall the boarding department is managed 
by a steward; the semiannual boarding fee is regulated by existing 
prices of food. Every pupil is required to pay 1 france a year for the 
use of tableware furnished by the steward at his own expense; breakage 
must be replaced by the students. 
Annual fees for board are generally very small. In the State normal 
schools of the Canton of Berne the poorest students pay the small 
amount of 150 to 170 francs. Additional payments, varied according 
to the wealth of the parents, are required of those better situated; for 
every 1,000 frances of reversionary or prospective property from 25 to 
270 franes is added, which fixes the maximum at between 400 to 420 
franes. Most of the payments range between 300 and 400 francs; 
those nearest to 300 francs predominate. 
According to the accounts of the boarding department of the peda- 
gogical section of the cantonal school in Soleure, the amount paid by 
the State for one student’s board in 1889 was 5.50 franes per week. 
Young teachers, after receiving appointments, must pay back this 
outlay at the rate of 3 francs per week. (Primary school law of 1873.) 
This amount does not include the weekly expenses of the State for 
light, heat, washing, medical attendance, sundry replenishments of
-P-A-G-E-500
  442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
inventory, averaging 1.75 francs per pupil; the total outlay amounts 
to 7.25 franes per week. 
As it is presupposed that pupils spend their vacation at home, the 
average boarding fee does not exceed 1 franc (20 cents) per day. Some 
schools board pupils during vacation, but only at an extra charge. As 
medical attendance and washing are included, the charges of boarding 
schools are really very moderate. Students from other cantons usually 
pay higher rates than those born within the limits of the canton. Indi- 
gent students are taken free of charge, or the boarding fee is reduced, 
or scholarships are granted which cover either all or part of the fee. 
State normal schools of the Canton of Berne grant scholarships to 
the amount of 400 franes per student, decreased in proportion to what 
a student must contribute toward the fee according to his financial con- 
dition. About two-thirds to three-fourths of the students pay the least 
amount, 150 frances, and receive the highest scholarships, 400 francs. 
Hauterive grants no real scholarships, but for indigent students the 
fee is reduced from 350 to 200 francs. We learn from Soleure that 
“scholarships are not necessary, as the State defrays the expenses of 
residence, board, medical aid, and washing.” 
The directors of the male normal school in Kreuzlingen sent the fol- 
lowing communication: 
In the school year of 1890-91, 44 of the 55 students of Thurgovie received scholar- 
ships. The lowest State scholarship amounted to 90 frances; the highest, to 200 
francs,- The synode grants extra scholarships to Catholic students of Thurgovie; 
9, ranging between 70 and 100 francs, were given in 1890-91, making the total 
amount received by each pupil 800 francs. The home cantons grant scholarships to 
nonresidents of Thurgovie to the amount of 350 francs, out of which the board fee 
must be paid. 
Two examples of menu cards will give an idea of the fare in boarding 
schools: 
Menu in normal school for men in Kreuzlingen.—Breakfast (7 o’clock) : 
Oatmeal porridge, with bread; Sundays, coffee and milk, with bread. 
Dinner: Soup, meat (pudding once), bread and vegetables, a pint of 
cider or a glass of wine. Afternoon collation {4 o’clock): Coffee and 
milk, with bread. Supper (7 o’clock): Soup, with bread; Sundays, sau- 
sage, cheese, and the like. 
Menu in normal school for men in Locarno.—Breakfast: Coffee and 
milk, with bread. Dinner: Soup, meat (200 grams), vegetables, bread, 
and a glass of wine. Afternoon collation (4 o’clock): Cold meat, sau- 
sage, or cheese, with fruit and bread. Supper: Meat soup or milk, 
with polenta and a glass of wine. 
It is surmised that other boarding schools similarly provide sufficient 
and wholesome food. 
: I. TEACHERS. 
Normal-school professors are appointed to instruct in a single branch 
or a few closely allied studies. In small schools the whole burden is 
borne by a few teachers. Large schools employ specialists for depart- 
 
-P-A-G-E-501
EDUCATION. IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 443 
mental teaching exclusively. In boarding schools teachers and even 
their families live in the schoolhouse (Wettingen). If unmarried, 
they eat at the table with the principal or steward. Families occupy 
dwellings connected with the institution, which obliges them to assist 
in superintending the students. 
In most cases the principal is at the same time superintendent of the 
dormitories, if not the steward. In this case he and his family enjoy 
the occupancy of a free dwelling. 
The professor’s term of office is usually one of six years, That of the 
principal is sometimes limited to the shorter time of State administra- 
tors; in Kussnacht (Ziirich), for example, to three years. Shorter terms 
prevail in Hitzkirch (Lucerne), four, and in Rorschach (St. Gall) two (to 
be extended to ten years by reelection). 
Salaries are either fixed or vary with the number of hours of work. 
The salaries of a few normal schools are as follows: State normal school 
of the Canton of Ziirich, 3,000 to 5,000 franes;! Berne, 2,000 to 3,000 
franes; Lucerne, 2,300 to 3,000 francs; Roker, 2,000 to 3,200 francs; 
St. Gall, 3,000 to 5,000 ‘comes; Gisons, 2 600 to 3,500 franes; Aargau, 
3,200 to ’3, 500 francs; Thurgovi ie, 2,400 to 3,600 frances, with additions 
for age Paul personal ‘qualifications; Vaud, 3,000 to 4,000 franes. 
Remuneration according to the number of eee per week is still in 
vogue to some extent on the basis of 100 to 200 frances (in Vaud 100; 
in Neufchatel 200) a year per weekly lesson. In the Canton of Geneva 
salaries thus regulated are so adjusted that 200 francs are paid for the 
first 10 weekly lessons, 190 for the 10 following, and 170 for every fol- 
lowing 10 weekly lessons. The differences are due to the fact that with 
an increase of lessons the quality of the instruction necessarily deteri- 
orates. In some branches the remuneration exceeds the first payment 
of 210 franes (history of pedagogy, 225 francs). 
The average salaries of private schools are less than those of State 
normal schools; on the other hand, city schools pay better than State 
institutions. 
The teachers of a normal school form a faculty whose opinion on 
important educational questions is consulted by supervisory authori- 
ties. The unlimited power of the principal, formerly granted to normal- 
school principals, proved a constant stumbling block in the way of 
other teachers, whose cooperation for the prosperity of the institution 
was rarely sought in conducting educational affairs, and this unlimited 
power has, in most normal schools, been restricted by placing part of 
the responsibility on the body of teachers. 
Sixty-six women teachers are employed in the female normal schools. 
Women teachers to the number of 33 are exclusively employed in both 
institutions of teaching sisters in Menzingen (Zug) and Ingenbohl 
(Schwyz) and in the female normal school in Brieg. All other institu-

1 franc = 19.3 cents.
-P-A-G-E-502
  444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
tions employ men teachers, too, who, as a rule, form the majority. A 
few female normal schools engage no other than men teachers (Zurich), 
or a single woman teacher may be found teaching with a number of 
men teachers (Berne. Lausanne, Neufchatel). 
IV. STUDENTS. 
The total number of male and female students at the 36 normal 
schools in Switzerland is 1,977, of which 1,294 are men and 683 women. 
Adding the 25 female students of the Froebel Normal School in Neuf- 
chatel, there are 2,002 students of both sexes, men forming about two- 
thirds, women about one-third of the whole. 
The female normal school of Zurich is the only one of its kind with 
afour year course. The four courses of the “teaching sisters’” insti- 
tutes at Ingenbohl (Schwyz) and Menzingen (Zug) are specially de- 
signed for the education of grammar school teachers and applicants 
for French schools. There are 11 normal schools for men with a four 
year course. The large institution of Soleure will soon advance into 
this category. The normal school at Rickenbach (Schwyz) is likewise 
included, as it has a preparatory course for those candidates whose pre- 
vious education is faulty, or who have attended no grammar school. 
More than half of the new entries are of this contingent. 
In most institutions students are conditionally admitted upon the 
results of a test examination. A shorter or longer probation is required. 
for permanent admission. Citizens of the Canton, as a rule, pay no 
tuition fee, which is required only of foreigners and nonresidents. 
Where normal schools are only a part of a more extensive school sys- 
tem a moderate tuition fee is demanded (20 to 60 francs a year=$4 
to $12. 
Poor students are assisted with scholarships in most institutions. 
Zurich occupies the place of honor in this respect. In 1890-91, 118 of 
153 pupils received scholarships, amounting to a total of 34,300 francs. 
The largest individual amounts, 400 and 500 francs, are given in the 
first and second and third and fourth grades, respectively. The 
average scholarship amounts to about 300 franes. As the board in 
private families costs about 12 to 15 francs per week (forty school 
weeks) the daily support of a student in Kussnacht costs from 500 to 
600 francs a year; clothes, books, and school materials require an 
additional outlay of about 200 to 300 franes. The education of a school- 
teacher in Zurich consequently costs about 800 francs (or $160) a year; 
or for the whole course, at the very lowest calculation, 3,000 francs, 
while the scholarships granted by the State to indigent pupils amount 
to 1,800 franes, at the very highest, for the entire course. 
Vaud ranks next. Male and female students of both schools in Lau- 
sanne are assisted in their daily support by subsidies from the State, 
which vary from 20 centimes to 1.40 frances per day; the highest yearly 
scholarship (for three hundred schoo! days) amounts to 420 francs. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-503
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 445 
scholarships granted during the year of 1890-91 amounted to 28,702 
frances. 
As arule, after having received their diplomas, students thus assisted 
are obliged to teach a number of years without compensation, or pay 
back the money advanced. Regulations on this point differ widely, 
the Cantons of Zurich and Valais being the extremes. 
In Zurich pupils who afterwards do not apply themselves to teach- 
ing, or resign within ten years after leaving school, are required by law 
to pay back all advanced amounts. The following arrangement pre- 
vails in Valais: Before entering the normal school students pledge 
themselves to teach eight consecutive years in the Canton, or repay the 
subsidies received from the State in proportion to the time remaining. 
Regulations in the other Cantons vary within the above-mentioned 
limits.

normal school students:

Where the students are not much restricted they feel, like other 
young men, the necessity of banding together in societies for mutual 
benefit. It is good for them to have experience in such affairs. As 
teachers they can not absolutely refrain from attending meetings of 
societies. Young teachers whose time is claimed to promote singing, 
gymnastics, and undertakings for the common benefit neglected by the 
community, often incur the danger of injuring themselves in trying to 
do too much for the common welfare. After they have once tasted the 
pleasare and pain of being a member and an officer of a society they are 
more circumspect in regard to the outgrowth of social life. 
Singing societies have been formed in the normal schools of Unter- 
strass, Hofwyl, Schiers, and Lausanne; athletic clubs in Kussnacht, 
Unterstrass, Hofwyl, Rorschach, Schiers, Wettingen, Kreuzlingen, and 
Lausanne; stenographic unions in Kussnacht, Hitzkirch, Zug, Ror- 
schach, Wettingen, Kreuzlingen, and Lausanne; reading circles in Kuss- 
nacht; societies for general purposes in Pruntrut and Peseux. 
‘Where normal schools are a division of cantonal secondary schools, 
students of the pedagogical section are admitted into existing cantonal 
school societies (Soleure, Chur). Five hundred and sixty graduates 
of normal schools obtained the State diploma in 1891; of these, 297 
were men and 241 women, and 22 women kindergartners.

V. EXAMINATIONS FOR MATURITY OR GRADUATION. 
Examinations for graduation of elementary-school teachers differ 
widely in the various cantons. In consideration of the large number 
and the extent of branches in which examinations are held, several 
cantons have arranged a timely division so conducted that at the end 
of the junior year a part of the examinations is completed (Zurich, 
Berne), or the theoretical examination is finished on leaving the normal 
school, and the practical is deferred until later (Lucerne, St. Gall); or, 
finally, the examinations are at once finished and the diploma conferred 
only on condition of subsequent practical service (Fribourg, Geneva). 
The following examples serve as illustrations: In Zurich, after the 
conclusion of the third year, general and sacred history, history of 
pedagogy, geography, and grammar are concluded in a preparatory 
examination; mathematics and natural science are finished in another 
examination; the other theoretical studies and practical examinations 
are completed at the end of the senior course. Experience in teaching 
proves to be beneficial to pupils and secures better results in exam- 
ination. The two years’ probation preceding a definite appointment is 
designed to supplement the practical preparation. 
A similar arrangement exists in the Canton of Berne for the exam- 
ination of primary-school teachers. The preparatory examination is 
held a year before the final examination, and embraces the following 
branches comprised within the limits of the course of study for the 
first five semesters: Psychology, religion, German, grammar and 
rhetoric, mathematics, natural science, history, geography, and pen- 
manship. The subjects for the final examination are the branches of 
the last two semesters in the above-mentioned studies; in addition, 
pedagogy and methodology, French, drawing, music, and gymnastics, 
as well as practical ability in teaching and training children. 
The Canton of Lucerne gives a conditional certificate for a year, at 
the end of which pupils must pass another examination to receive the 
final diploma. The following arrangement prevails in the Canton of 
Fribourg: Ifthe students have passed the first examination for diploma, 
the senior students, after leaving the normal school, serve a year’s pro- 
bation under a good instructor who directs them in practical teaching. 
Superintendents indicate to the public-school board the teacher under 
whom a probationer is likely to benefit most. After a year’s probation 
the students undergo a second examination, the result of which decides 
whether a diploma is to be granted. 
In St. Gall a conditional certificate is granted on the results of a final 
normal-school examination. After the lapse of two years, which must 
be spent in teaching, candidates take the examinations for graduation, 
which are based upon practical and general education. In Grisons, 
according to the applicant’s accomplishments, diplomas of the first and 
second degree, accompanied by certificates of admission, are granted,
-P-A-G-E-505
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. AAT 
which permit the recipient to teach. To be eligible admitted teachers 
must secure a diploma by passing a new examination. The examina- 
tions for graduation are held at the close of the normal-school course; 
the examinations for admission to the profession at the end of a review 
course. : 
In Valais likewise a conditional teacher’s certificate is given at the 
close of the normal-school course. 
If, at the end of the year, the local school inspector hands in a report expressing 
satisfaction to the department of education, the candidate in question is allowed to 
teach four years longer. At the end of this time he is obliged to pass another exam- 
ination to be permanently appointed as teacher. To comply with these requisitions 
most teachers, after an absence of five years, return to the normal school for a two- 
months review, which prepares them for the practical examination. 
The Canton of Geneva differs from that of Fribourg in only one point. 
After receiving the diploma of the pedagogical section of the college, 
or of the secondary school for women, and devoting the specified time 
to practical exercise (probation), no second examination is required for 
permanent appointment, but only a proof of having taught at a pri- 
mary school. 
We find many arrangements directed toward supplementing and 
broadening the deficient practical preparation the normal schools offer, 
and preserving the consciousness in young teachers that they can only 
be successful in the practice of their profession by continually endeayor- 
ing to perfect their general scientific and special professional education. 
At one normal school a permanent arrangement exists for aiding and 
promoting self-culture and review, repetition, or continuation courses 
(Vaud). For the purpose of elevating instruction in certain branches 
other normal schools from time to time institute regular and, occasion- 
ally, obligatory normal courses in methodology, singing, gymnastics, 
drawing, etc. Attendance is either compulsory or strongly recom- 
mended. Participants, as a rule, receive allowances from the State to 
help defray the increased expenses. 
VI. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. 
(1) Buildings and grounds.—The buildings occupied by normal schools 
are sequestered monasteries (Kussnacht, Pruntrut, Hitzkirch, Ricken- 
bach, Hauterive, Rorschach, Wettingen), still existing monasteries 
(Ingenbohl, Menzingen, Zug), former inns (Unterstrass), old country 
seats, or school buildings which serve other educational purposes 
likewise. i 
A few examples will illustrate this. The normal school of Kussnacht 
possesses a main building for classes and the principal’s residence, a 
gymnasium, a practice-school building, and an electric-power house. 
The accommodations of the normal school for women, in Hindelbank, 
consist of the parsonage, in which the principal and greater number of 
pupils live, a school building with gymnasium, hall with class rooms,
-P-A-G-E-506
  A448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
and a launary. Some normal schools for men have large areas of land 
for agricultural purposes; others have a large garden for recreation and 
the growing of vegetables (Hofwyl, Delsberg, Muristalden, Rickenbach, 
Hauterive, Rorschach, Wettingen, and Kreuzlingen). 
As arule, the agricultural department is managed by a skilled agri- 
culturist instead of the normal school principal. The most valuable 
landed property is controlled by the State normal schools in Hofwyl, 
Hauterive, Rorschach, Wettingen, and Kreuzlingen. 
(2) Income.—The income of normal schools is derived from invested 
property, tuition fees, board, and incidental sources. The income from 
real estate is generally very small. In boarding schools the income is 
either expended “in natura” for housekeeping (Hofwyl, Hitzkirch, 
Rickenbach, ete.), or the produce delivered for general use is rated and 
noted in the account book under income and expense (Rorschach, Wet- 
tingen, Kreuzlingen). 
As in most normal schools instruction is gratuitous, the income 
derived from tuition fees hardly amounts to 30,000 franes for all of the 
37 normal schools. Most of this is paid by nonresidents or foreigners. 
Board, which sometimes includes the tuition fees, amounts to about 
160,000 francs for all the 12 boarding schools. 
Receipts independent of appropriations granted by the State and 
communities are limited to contributions of societies and individuals 
for the benefit of private schools, and amount to about 60,000 franes a 
year. The total income of the 37 normal schools, not including amounts 
granted by the State and communities—as far as information goes— 
amounts,to about 250,000 franes, or $50,000, and does not cover one- 
fourth of the necessary expenses. 
(3) Bapenses.—An examination of the yearly expenses in connection 
with normal school education is attended with the greatest difficulties. 
Normal schools, which are only a division of a more extensive educa- 
tional system, keep no separate accounts; in most cases, authorities 
haye not even attempted to make the detailed, though not impossible, 
distinction. Information on this point is therefore inaccurate and 
incomplete. A few calculations are based upon the author’s own esti- 
mate attained by a comparison with other information received. The 
result obtained should not conflict with the actual expenditure, and 
should be rather less than greater. 
An annual sum of 1,000,000 francs is spent on normal school educa- 
tion in Switzerland; with 2,000 students this gives an average of 550 
franes ($110) per student. 
Half of this goes toward salaries and one quarter toward the living 
expenses in boarding schools. It is very gratifying to see that most 
eantons are ever more willing and generous in extending a helping 
hand to those students who are zealous but poor. The information 
received concerning scholarships, though not altogether reliable, states 
the annual amount thus spent to be above 150,000 franes.  
-P-A-G-E-507
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 449 
The apparatus at normal schools seems to be generally very simple 
and inadequate. The expenses for school-room necessities are very 
low, hardly exceeding the amount of 30,000 francs. 
CONCLUSION. 
The examination of normal schools in Switzerland proves that every- 
where diligent and earnest efforts are being made to promote the cause 
of normal education; that teachers may be qualified in a proportion- 
ately short time with the general education and professional knowledge 
and ability requisite for the practice of their vocation; but that uni- 
formity of action presupposed by the united public does not exist. 
There are no unifying measures taken. Allis individual effort. Strong 
and progressive institutions do not support those that are weak and 
backward. These institutions do not even hold free, common council. 
Teachers at Swiss gymnasia, or secondary schools, meet at least once 
a year to discuss mooted questions affecting their work. The normal 
schools of Switzerland are not only separated from the other higher 
educational institutions in their own canton, but each normal school 
occupies an isolated position in regard to the others. 
It would be quite inadmissible to speak of the necessity of Federal interference 
in the question of normal school education, though national unity could be thus 
most effectually promoted [says Grob], but it scems our duty at least to point out 
the desirability of general intereourse among the normal schools of Switzerland, 
and express the hope that visiting normal school teachers consider themselves the 
bearers of a national spirit, and miss no opportunity in their travels throughout the 
Ste te to preserve old associations and form new ties of feeling and action. 
VII.—MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. 
For several years the subject of mental fatigue in secondary schools 
in Germany has been discussed with much show of ardor, and school 
authorities in that country have frequently been assailed for expecting 
too much work of the juvenile brain. Representatives of the science 
of hygiene, feeling themselves called upon to substantiate these charges, 
subjected some schools to a rigid test. Leo Burgerstein, of Vienna, and 
others, notably Professor Hoepfner, of Berlin, were successful in pre- 
senting statistical results which were in every way reliable, because 
scientifically obtained and tabulated. Professor Burgerstein presented 
his results in the form of a diagram, called the “fatigue curve,” before a 
meeting of the Society of Hygiene in London (1892), and at other 
places; and Hoepfner published in 1893 a little book in which he pre- 
sented the results arrived at accompanied with very impressive lan- 
guage. Both gentlemen are practical school men; and their words and 
figures made a deep impression. Later Professor Kraepelin published 
a work on the “Limits of mental capacity in youth” (1894), in which 
he made use of the before-mentioned tests, and added others, reviewing 
ED 95——15
-P-A-G-E-508
    450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the question with great erudition from a physiological and psychological 
standpoint. This attempt to substantiate the statement that the Ger- 
man high schools, both classical and modern, make demands upon the 
mind, which youth can not live up to without serious injury to health, has 
naturally created an opposition which deserves to be heard, inasmuch 
as overpressure has often been said to exist when on various occasions 
comparisons were instituted in this country between German and Ameri- 
can schools. Dr. Gustav Richter, a man of great erudition and practi- 
cal experience, gives voice to the opposition in an article published 
under the caption “Instruction and mental fatigue” in ‘“Lehrproben 
und Lehrgiinge,” Halle, Germany. His arguments are the more accept- 
able since they are advanced with candor and laudable impartiality. 
An extract from his article is here inserted. Dr. Richter says: 
The opponents of our present school system, ever since Lorinser’s famous book 
appeared, have used the catchword ‘mental fatigue” as a weighty argument 
against the organization of the entire system of secondary schools. In numerous 
pamphlets caused by the fierce educational struggle raging in Germany, evidences for 
and against this assumed fact have been furnished, and new material, statistical and 
otherwise, has been published which urged school authorities everywhere to counter- 
act by real or assumed improvements and revisions of the courses of study, the 
dangerous excess of demands upon the youthful brain. Nevertheless, a solution of 
the burning question has not yet been reached. 
No investigator has been able to state the laws of mental growth in the age of 
development other than in general lines; nor has anyone been able so clearly and 
distinctly to define the beginning of fatigue and the staties of mental capacity for 
the different steps of the juvenile period of development so that schools could derive 
from them useful regulations for the minutix of practical work. In reply to Preyer’s 
essay on ‘Natural Science and School” I have emphasized that no single professional 
science as such can have the privilege of determining aims and methods of school 
education, but that only to pedagogy can be given tho right to do that, it being the 
general science of education. But I have acknowledged that pedagogy must listen 
to other sciences and use them as supplementary sciences. With reference to natu- 
ral sciences, I said: ‘‘They must state the amount of elementary knowledge from the 
various fields of science necessary for general foundation of higher study. This is 
a task which, though it may seem simple, is by no means accomplished with una- 
nimity by the representatives of higher education. Second, natural science must 
give us the conditions and laws of physical development, and, as far as is possible in 
connection with that, also of psychical development. From this may be derived the 
right to supervise the schools from a medical standpoint, and to examine with refer- 
ence to hygiene the buildings and everything appertaining to them. 
The first of these two tasks Lothar Meyer has earnestly tried to perform. The 
second task has recently been tried by Emil Kraepelin, professor of psychiatry in 
Heidelberg. His work, entitled ‘Concerning Mental Labor” (Jena, G. Fischer, 
1894), is an eminently useful one, because in place of glittering generalities, such as 
“excessive demands upon the gray substance of the young brain,” and “ excessive 
accumulation of knowledge in the undeveloped brain,” he offers scientifically gath- 
ered facts which represent tests and observations beyond criticism. And yet his 
conclusions are wrong. How that is possible will be seen if we review his work 
from the standpoint of experience. 
He first investigates the limits of mental capacity in youth. School [he says] 
makes daily demands for a certain measure of brain work without being convinced 
that the juvenile brain is able to perform such work without serious injury. We 
send the ship out upon the open sea without a trial trip, that is to say, without
-P-A-G-E-509
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE, 451 
knowing whether it will be seaworthy. In order to obtain reliable information 
concerning this we must examine the conditions of fatigue in children. 
The author starts out with tests made with adults. He says: 
That which we can determine with great accuracy is the working power of the 
‘individual in simple mental performances. To measure them we may utilize a num- 
ber of small tasks of equal difficulty, and problems to be solved within a given time, 
as, for instance, counting of letters, reading, memorizing rows of numbers, syllables 
and words, a continuous adding of simple numbers, and similar work. All this~ 
work was carefully examined by him, but he only gives us the result obtained in 
adding numbers. The persons tested were students in the university, assistant 
professors, young men who were of nearly equal education and age. In exercise 
books specially prepared for the purpose, the professor made them add without 
interruption the figures printed. When the sum of one hundred was reached the 
hundreds were omitted and the addition of units was continued. At intervals of 
five minutes a signal with the bell was given, and a line was made under the figure 
added last. When the results were examined, it was found how many numbers in - 
periods of five minutes each person had added. This clearly showed the degree of 
velocity with which different persons work. This result will be found in every 
kind of simple action. The difference in individual capacities will plainly show up. 
This kind of test simply proves the individuality of personal capacity and nothing 
else. 
Common experience has taught us that the performance is greatly influenced by 
the amount of exercise one has in it. The rapidity in adding will increase with 
every test, until a certain limit is reached beyond which this velocity can not be’ 
increased by exercise. : 
The extent of capacity for exercise seems to the author to be a general quality of 
the individual. He who proves himself very capable in ‘gaining skill in any one 
field of action is apt to increase his velocity in working in other fields. Whethera 
similar statement can be made with reference to the power gained by exercise has 
not been investigated sufficiently, but it may be stated that a skill once obtained is 
not lost very rapidly. After several months the author plainly noticed the skill 
gained by the exercises in addition mentioned before, though they had lasted only 
a few hours. 
Professor Kraepelin has also discussed fatigue. According to the 
views of modern physiology, fatigue is a chemical process in the organic 
cells. The working muscle secretes waste material, which is poisonous. 
The stronger the brain activity, the more copious is this secretion of 
the brain cells. Their environments are contaminated, the poison gets 
into the blood and through the circulatory organs it comes in contact 
with the nerves and cells of other parts of the body. With the aid of 
oxygen it is consumed in the blood or destroyed by the liver, or dis- 
carded through the kidneys. When this decayed matter accumulates 
in the blood we feel fatigued; if we exceed the physiological limits we 
become diseased (compare Mosso’s “‘Fatigue”); but there seem to be 
also psychic factors in the process of fatigue for which a physiological 
explanation is difficult. 
The progressive increase in the capacity for work through exercise is opposed by 
the effects of fatigue, which progress much faster. Fatigue everywhere causes a 
decrease in the amount of work performed, although this deerease may be equalized 
for a time byincreasing skill. As soon as fatigue takes the upper hand the capacity 
for work vanishes quickly and incessantly, 
 
-P-A-G-E-510
452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The author further points to the differences in the fatigue limit of 
individuals and shows that nevertheless all persons, aside from special 
well-founded irregularities, exhibit in all kinds of work a similar pro- 
cess in harmony with the given individuality; hence arises the fact of 
the extent of individual endurance. This is the fundamental quality 
of each individual, and it determines in general the capacity for work. 
Aside from the general state as to fatigue, there are other elements that seem to be 
open to determination by measure. Thus, for instance, the fixation of the degree of 
diversion to which a person is subject; the elasticity of his capacity for work, that 
is to say, the power to equalize disturbances; the dependence of mental power of 
work upon the amount of nourishment, the duration of sleep or physical exertion. 
Finally, as a supplement to the measurements of velocity, must be considered the 
investigations concerning the value of work, which will be exceedingly difficult. 
At any rate the author has demonstrated that it is actually possible “‘to express 
important peculiarities of a mental personality in numbers and comparative ratios.” 
Yet, after all, 1t appears to me [says Professor Richter] as though in the methods 
of investigation applied the measurement of the fatigue limit can not be determined 
with the same accuracy with which the extent of capacity of exercise or skill can 
be determined. Mental fatigue is not only dependent upon the performance of 
work, but also upon accompanying conditions of the emotions. It is a well-known 
psychological fact that feelings of displeasure will facilitate fatigue, while feelings 
of pleasure will check it. The inner relation of the individual to the work he is 
performing is a factor which must be considered in investigating his fatigue limit. 
The author has not entered into that side of the question, and hence the results of 
his investigation can not have a convincing character. To add continuously for 
several hours numbers of a single digit is such a tedious work that it generates a 
feeling of displeasure which will facilitate fatigue and injure the elasticity of the 
mind. It must be deplored that the persons examined by Professor Kraepelin were 
only tested with reference to their velocity in working, not to the correctness of 
their work; only with reference to the extent, not to the value of the work. It is 
true the mathematical fixing of the part which interest has in the work will meet 
with insurmountable obstacles. Mental life consists of such complex processes that 
every attempt at a mechanical explanation must be stamped at once as inadequate. 
If the author had given to the persons to be examined a number of interesting 
problems from their own field of labor, which would, of course, have prevented the 
test in velocity, he would doubtless have come to other results in reference to the 
phenomena of fatigue. Moreover, the success each person attained would have 
changed the entire result in many ways. 
In discussing the fatigue of school children the author refers to 
investigations of practical schoolmen, the results of which have been 
published in recent years. Leo Burgerstein, in Vienna, placed four 
rows of simple arithmetical problems before the pupils who were 
familiar with their solution. Each period of ten minutes of written 
work was followed by a recess of five minutes. These problems or 
tasks he submitted to 162 children, in the age between 11 and 13, at the 
beginning of a school day. During the intervals of recess new blanks 
containing the problems were distributed, and at the tap of the bell 
the pupils again went to work, and so on through the morning session. 
The performance was measured with reference to its amount by the 
number of problems solved in each period of ten minutes, and the value 
of the performance was measured by the absence of mistakes. He
-P-A-G-E-511
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 453 
was careful, also, to consider the corrections which the children had 
made during the work. 
The result shows that the number of digits used had increased from 
period to period, demonstrating thereby a considerable average increase 
in the velocity of work. This increase, however, was made by only 92 
pupils, while 70 lagged behind. 
The increased velocity is accompanied by an increased number of 
errors. This, again, is true only with reference to those who progressed 
rapidly in speed, while those who lagged behind showed relatively 
fewer errors. The followiug table shows the general results:

The small increase in the number of errors between groups 3 and 4 
is remarkable. It seems as though the children had unconsciously 
meant to rest in order to start anew in the fourth period. With the 
rapid increase in the number of errors is noticed an increasing number 
of corrections. The fewest corrections are made in the third period. 
Fewer corrections and a greater increase in the number of errors are 
undoubted evidences of mental fatigue. 
Similar observations were made by Hoepfner in Berlin when investigating the work 
of 9-year-old boys written from dictation. They had been occupied with 19 sen- 
tences for nearly two hours, and the work had been careful and slow. In this case, 
also, the number of errors, which were at first small, increased rapidly toward the 
end of the work. Computed on the basis of 100 letters, the errors increased from 0.9 
to over 6.4 percent. Kraepelin refers again to the tests in addition to which he had 
submitted his students and assistant professors, and he states that each thirty min- 
utes of work was followed by a recess of ten minutes. It was noticeable that the 
work after each pause was more rapid than in the preceding period. He explains 
this fact by the influence which practice has in generating skill, and by the fact 
that fatigue is counteracted during the pause of rest. Fatigue disappears compara- 
tively quickly, while the gain in skill remains, and can be noticed for a long time 
after. 
From this we may derive a lesson and a valuable principle for practice in the school- 
room Zit is that by inserting short pauses between periods of work the power is 
increased and the destructive effect of fatigue is counteracted; the gain in form of 
skill is very great, whereas skill might be destroyed if the pauses were not inserted. 
Hence Kraepelin demands more frequent pauses, and he claims that it would be wise 
to increase them in length as the school session proces.) 
I shall return to this point; and at present quote the author, who thinks he is accu- 
rately sketching the condition of school children during instruction. The picture 
he presents is, according to his own expression, a frightful one: 
Since it is demonstrated [says Kraepelin] that 12-year-old pupils show the first 
signs of fatigue after a period of ten minutes in simple work, it stands to reason that 
mental work lasting through several hours, only broken into by brief periods of rest, 
must inevitably lead to complete mental exhaustion. The intensity of attention 
 
-P-A-G-E-512
    454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
demanded is much too great. The pauses of rest are much too short, and a normal 
capacity for work can not be maintained under such circumstances. After the first 
hour of that kind of work the pupil will be in a narcosis of fatigue which makes him 
incapable of applying his strength to understand and follow the instruction. It 
stands to reason that this condition shows variations in different pupils and ages. 
The younger ones are, as a rule, so tired after the first hour that the powerful influ- 
ence of exercise and skill gained are not able to counterbalance the progressive 
decrease in the capacity for work. 
Not without amusement one reads what the author adds to this picture in gray 
upon a gray background: “But I freely confess that the picture is painted in colors 
too dark AsI have described it, the situation would be correct if school accom- 
plished what it attempts. Howeverf kind nature has given our growing generation 
asafety valve, the value of which can scarcely be gauged too high; itis that of inat- 
tention.} Only with force, and even then for a very short period of time, can we 
succeed in securing the attention of our pupils upon the solution of problems given 
them.€ Now ere is there a school in which a whole session can be considered a ses- 
sion of work. Burgerstein, it is true, believed that the inserted pauses would secure 
a proper relation between effort and recreation in any regular school hour. Yet his 
tests prove incontrovertibly that our youth would necessarily incur mental disease 
if they were forced to work steadily and with intense attention for forty minutes of 
every hour of the school day. That comparatively few are seriously injured men- 
tally by overexertion in school is owing to those branches, and likewise to those 
teachers, that give to the pupil the blessed opportunity to loosen the reins of his 
fatigued attention and to forget himself. ‘‘We can force pupils to sit still,” says 
Burgerstein, ‘‘but we must not deceive ourselves, for in many cases they will rest 
mentally or rest by obtaining a change of mental occupation and not follow the 
course of instruction when they are tired. From this the unexpected conclusion is 
deriyed that tedious teachers, so-called preaching teachers, have become a neces- 
sity{ If all teachers understood how to awaken intenso interest for their subject of 
instruction and how to keep it awake, the children would, despite rapidly growing 
fatigue be led to ever increasing efforts, the consequences of which could scarcely 
be perce} 
So, then, ifattentive pupils and tedious teachers are the necessary contrivances to 
break the speed of the rapidly running school machine. This is a contradiction of 
ideas that borders on nonsense: A school is the better, the worse it is. 
However, joking aside, there is a grain of truth in this paradox. There are teach- 
ers who with iron energy hold the attention of their pupils in such tension that for 
other branches, especially during the lessons immediately following those of the 
energetic teacher, the pupils are absolutely unfit for work and consider it a blessing 
when the teacher lays fewer or no claims upon their strength. And among the 
inadequacy of all human institutions the school of the future, like the present, will 
suffer from human imperfection, and will be grateful if nature in her kindness will 
equalize in her own inimitable way the errors of poor mortals. However, that is 
neither here nor there. Above afl we must find out whether the conclusions of the 
author are unobjectionable. They start from facts experimentally secured. Have 
these conclusions convincing power? 
We need not appeal to human imperfection. It can be shown that the conclusions 
of Professor Kraepelin are erroneous, because they start from wrong premises. If 
in a pupil 12 years old, after a simple kind of work of barely fiftéen minutes’ dura- 
tion, the first signs of fatigue are noticed, a continuation of that work, broken into 
by brief pauses only, would lead to utter exhaustion. To this conclusion leads the 
presupposition that a single form of written work entered upon with well-defined 
intention (for instance, that of examining the mental capacity) may be taken for, or 
confounded with, the general term instruction. In this lies the key to the erro- 
neous conclusion. The author evidently presupposes that the organization and pur-
-P-A-G-E-513
     
   EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 455 
pose of school claim that the children be kept at the same tension all through the 
hours of the school day in which they had been kept during the trial lesson, which 
consisted of test work and mechanical repetition of processes. If this supposition 
were correct—that is, if these tests were really a photograph of the general working 
of school instruction—the author’s conclusions might be considered sound, for les- 
sons of that kind have all the characteristics the uniform effect of which is a dead- 
ening pressure upon the juvenile brain. Let us try to define these characteristics. 
It is plain, first, that test work such as was described will hold the thoughts of 
the pupil exactly in one direetion. The same nerve currents, the same ganglia cells 
are kept in uninterrupted activity. This is the cause why nothing isso fatiguing as 
uniform mental exertion. Second, such work forces all the pupils simultaneously to 
the same degree of exertion. The pressure is a constant one, acting upon all alike. 
Finally, the work obliges the pupils, during the entire time it takes to perform it, 
to a certain position of the body, which increases fatigue. It is quite obvious that 
the enforced uniform position of the body necessitates one-sided exertion of certain 
groups of muscles, while others are kept idle. Feelings of displeasure are generated 
thereby, which check the activity of the brain. 
However, the real average condition of the process of teaching and learning in 
school, if conducted by a reasonable teacher, is very different. Certainly school 
demands the attention and participation of the pupil during the whole school day. 
But as the direction of the instruction within each branch changes frequently, the 
degreo of mental tension it claims for the pupil’s activity varies greatly. 
Burgerstein makes the same mistake with reference to his test work when he says: 
“During the time of instruction every participant should, as it was done here, be 
oceupied constantly.” : 
Professor Uhlig, in reviewing Kraepelin’s volume, remarks: ‘I do not in the least 
doubt the exactness of these tests, but I claim that it is erroneous to draw the con- 
elusions which the author publishes, for these experiments placed the children before 
awhole series of tasks in the same field of action, the doing of which required a 
specially high degree of attention. Now, it would be erroncous to assert that the 
practice in school throughout is analogous to this procedure, or that it should be 
analogous. If every lesson of the day should demand so high a degree of tension as 
these test lessons did, school, as it is now conducted, would be subject to the accusa- 
tion of the most frightful waste of time. No school works constantly in the manner 
indicated.” 
The beneficial influence of change upon mental activity is a fact to which the 
school pays a good deal of attention, both with reference to the order in which the 
branches follow in the time-table and with reference to the method of teaching 
in each single lesson. Every instruction following correct methodical prin- 
ciples Will Show Variations in the mental tension demanded of the pupil, according 
to the amount of self-activity or passive acceptation of knowledge required. There 
is also a variation of the mental activity depended upon or caused by the different 
objects in view; that_is to say, whether lessons are given in which natural objects 
are viewed or accomplishments—such as drawing, singing, writing, and the like— 
are practiced, or whether intense thinking is required, as in arithmetic{ It can not 
be tolerated to occupy the children with grammar or mental arithmetic for hours at 
atime. A teacher who does such a thing is breeding mischief and should be severely 
reprimanded. 
Every lesSon in itself offers a great many opportunities for change in mental 
activity. The processes of apperception and abstraction, exercise and application 
of which each claims a different psychical activity, change places very frequently. 
It is well to emphasize this. In language lessons a poem or a piece in the reader is 
treated. First, a brief review is held by appropriate questions; then the piece is 
explained with reference to contents and form. The progress of the action or the 
development of the thought is followed. Finally comes the exercise in expressive 
 
-P-A-G-E-514
456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
reading. The different psychical actions are alternately at work. Now it is judg- 
ment, another time it is the power of apperception, and again it may be a play of 
emotions. This constant change prevents fatigue. 
During a lesson in foreign languages translation from and into the language takes 
place; sentences and paragraphs are read; the linguistic form is analyzed; the 
thought is fixed; the recasting of a thought in the other language is attempted; 
contents are explained; grammatical exercises take place, alternating with forming 
and re-forming of sentences; the etymology is studied, and the practice of rules takes 
place, etc. All these things cause constant changes in the mental activity of the 
pupil, which prevent fatigue. History, geography, and nature studies offer the 
greatest variety, both with reference to the matter and method. Even abstract 
mathematics claims a variety of changes by seeking points of contact with sense 
perception, and hence permits many pauses of rest from mental tension. Moreover, 
there are various modes of presenting and solving problems, aly of which cause 
variety. 
It is admitted that the pupil can not be spared earnest mental work; but that it 
should be in the nature of our educational aim that its work must necessarily lead 
to exhaustion can be positively denied. Sound common sense and the rules of 
didactics proteéé the pup 
fatigued by, not merely being displeased with, certain subjects it is well, as far as 
possible, to let this feeling subside or be counteracted before the same subjects are 
taken up again in a somewhat different form.” Mosso expresses himself in a similar 
manner, saying: ‘‘The best teachers are those who never overexert one region of 
    “Sufficiently. Herbart says: ‘(When the pupil is really | 
5 | \ 
the brain of their pupils and who understand the art of attracting the attention, / / 
now here, now there, so that it may after awhile with new vigor return to the subs 
ject at issue.” a 
Upon such”application of method depends the refreshing, revivifying effect of 
good school instruction. ‘here is recreation in change. If proper pauses for rest 
are arranged, and if these pauses are spent iff the open air, while the schoolrooms 
are thoroughly aired by opening the windows, and if gymnastics and games are 
provided for, I really do not know what more could be offered to the growing gen- 
eration both in regard to physical and mental development. Fatigue taking place 
after protracted tension can be removed by the two chief remedies which are found 
in change in occupation and complete recreation. This balance would be much more 
effective if school had only to deal with healthy children; but we must consider the 
many weak children who suffer from poverty of the blood and who do not during 
their school years receive proper nourishment, nor get sufficient sleep, nor engugh 
of other important agencies for hygienic development. It can not be doubted that} 
the school in many cases remedies the errors made at home. The healthfal discipline) 
which accustoms the children to regular mental activity, the proper change between 
work and recreation, the habitation in well aired and lighted rooms, bodily exercise 
and movement by means of gymnastics and play, as well as in school excursions, a 
habit acquired in obedience, order, punctuality, and cleanliness are for many chil, 
dren a deliverance from destruction and ruin. 
Professor Richter then goes on to ao. figures obtained from test 
work to which the pupils of the gymnasium in Jena were subjected; 
they are very interesting, and their value is great owing to the scien- 
tific method pursued in obtaining the results; but they are omitted 
here because they essentially repeat what has been said before. 
A few words concerning hygienic school statistics may conclude the 
chapter. Prof. Otto Jiger, in Cologne, in reviewing Kraepelin’s and 
Erb’s books, says, that in an experience of forty years both in small and 
extensive educational institutions he had very rarely found nervous-
-P-A-G-E-515
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 457 
ness among the school diseases. He could, if called upon, draw up a 
counter-bill of cases in which the nervous system of spoiled mother’s 
sons had greatly improved as soon as they had been required to live a 
regular school life. “Say what you will, and take it all in all, the life 
within a large public school is on an average a very healthy life.” 
The drawing up of such an account, to which doubtless other educa- 
tors could add contributions, would be a very meritorious undertaking: 
The observations made on nervous children would be supported by 
numbers far inferior to those of healthy children. It is true, we have 
not as yet a thorough science of school statistics, but various attempts 
may be quoted. Prof. Axel Key, of Stockholm, states in his school- 
hygienic investigations (1889) that in Sweden the children in the upper 
grades of the common school had fourteen hours of daily work. Thirty- 
six per cent ofthe girls are chlorotic, and about 10 per cent of them 
suffer from spinal curvature. Aside from nearsightedness he found in 
the schools of Sweden and Denmark that nearly 40 per cent of the 
children suffered from chronic diseases. This exhaustion and wasting 
away of strength among the children he ascribes to overtaxing, to the 
enormous amount of school tasks with which they are burdened. The 
school physician and professor of hygiene in Budapest, Dr. Heinrich 
Schuschny, says in a recently published pamphlet entitled “Concerning 
the nervosity of school children,” that in a certain institution which 
he names, 46.4 per cent of the pupils in the four lower grades suffered 
from symptoms of nervousness, and that this proportion rose to 57 per 
cent in the four upper grades. Still more unfavorable is the result of 
the observations of Professor Nesteroff, in Moscow, who for four years 
observed 216 students of the gymnasium of that city. He noticed 
that the proportion of pupils suffering from nervous ailments rose from 
8 per cent in the preparatory grades to 67 per cent in the highest of 
eight grades. 
Now, how shall such figures be judged? A few hints are given us by 
Professor Schuschny. A great proportion of the pupils examined 
belonged to the Jewish population, who, according to the author and 
the verdict of medical specialists, are overburdened and oppressed. I 
ean not judge whether this is true, but from further explanations of 
the author I judge that a large number of these pupils belonged to the 
poorer strata, who are early in life forced into occupations for the pur- 
pose of winning their daily bread. 
Often the pupils could only make their attendance in school possible by giving 
private lessons to little boys; several of them had to support parents. There are in 
our school students who give private lessons for three or four hours a day; others 
are obliged to help their parents in stores and shops; one student has to rise at 4.30 
o’clock in the morning in order to aid his uncle. 
Another hint refers to the intimate relation between the use of stim- 
ulants and nervousness, 
Of our students 47.7 per cent use alcoholic beverages at home, mostly wine. I 
found that the greater number of these students suffered from nervous symptoms. 
ED 95. 15*  
-P-A-G-E-516
458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Their proportion to those students who. use alcoholic beverages but do not suffer 
from nervous symptoms is 56.8 to 43.1 per cent, an obvious proof of the influence of 
alcohol upon the nervous system. 
It is to be regretted that a statement concerning the amount of 
alcoholic beverages consumed at home can not be taken into consid- 
eration. It would likewise be important to obtain statistics on the 
influence of nicotine upon the nervous system of schoolboys. I can 
bear witness to that influence by stating that a senior student twice 
declared that he had been obliged to be absent from school because 
he had temporarily poisoned himself with nicotine through cigarette 
smoking. Investigation at home proved the correctness of the state- 
ment, and the advice given to the parents, either to forbid or to limit 
the enjoyment of cigarettes (the school as such can only forbid smoking 
in public), was successful only in one of the two cases. Schuschny 
inquired into the duration of sleep of his pupils, and found that among 
nervous children it was too short. He does not mention the nature 
and quantity of their food, although concerning this point very inter- 
esting facts might be gathered. The time after school hours and on 
holidays is not spent in the most advantageous way. 
Is there to-day a pupil of a high school who has not at least once in his life seen 
a Parisian drama on the stage in which adultery is the chief motive, and then think 
of the books and modern newspapers. Very few parents attend to the physical 
development of their children; few ever take their children out for a walk in the 
open air and into the woods. A diminishingly small fraction of our school boys 
and girls make use of the skating pond in winter or the swimming school in 
summer, 
Ihave quoted these statements of Schuschny’s, although they have 
no reference to German conditions, in order to indicate what difficul- 
ties are in the way of a proper estimate of statistical material; and 
what a want of logic it betrays if physical disturbances in children are 
without hesitancy attributed to the influence of school life. Mosso 
declares this in his investigations as an absolutely insurmountable 
difficulty, so that we can not say how many of the boys might be 
healthy and how many might be ill, if they did not go to school at all. 
Schuschny mentions, among the causes of overtaxing, the fact that 
in Hungarian secondary schools the departmental system of teaching 
is in general vogue. According to this every branch of instruction is 
assigned to a specialist, hence in a school of nine grades we may find 
as many as 11 teachers changing places within a single school day in a 
single class room. The physician makes some very pointed remarks 
_ concerning this. 
This system frustrates the educative efforts of school. In Germany 
every teacher has to teach a group of relative branches, and in every 
room a class teacher, who has charge of the discipline and attendance 
roll, has the largest number of hours per week to teach in that class 
room. In Bavaria the class teacher teaches everything save mathe- 
matics and natural science. To the class teacher is assigned the duty
-P-A-G-E-517
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 459 
of keeping in constant contact with his colaborers, so as to secure an 
organic unity of class instruction and prevent the accumulation of 
home lessons. Specialists always have the aspiration to magnify their 
branches and demand a degree of attention and interest which can not 
be maintained uniformly all through the day unless a class teacher 
restricts these demands to their proper limits. 
In regard to this system we have no statistics, and all our arguments 
are based on individual experience, the whole tenor of which, however, 
is so obviously convincing that there can be no doubt as to one thing, 
namely, that the system of specializing will foster special talents in a 
few robust thinkers and me dwarf the great majority of aver: biage 
talents. eee ee = ae 
The introduction of well planned and regularly compiled eck 
hygienic statistics is not only desirable, but a requisite of the school o: 
the future. The science of statistics thus properly supplemented will, 
to a more satisfactory degree than hitherto, influence the various con- 
ditions of the growing generation. It will investigate the physical 
status of the pupils, and thus offer the material for investigation con- 
cerning the reciprocal relation of life in school and life in the family. 
Not until then will the troublesome question of overtaxing the brain be 
solyed in a scientific way. Any State that would begin with obtaining 
such statistics would deserve great credit. I suggest a few important 
points: The Government should appoint a commission consisting of 
physicians and educators and assisted by executive officers. In this 
commission should be an expert in hygiene and psychiatry (if possible, 
he should be a university professor), several practical educators, and the 
State school commissioner—the latter should be the president. This 
commission should be charged with preparing schedules of inquiry, 
formulas, and blanks to be filled out. The statistical data gained from 
these local census returns would have to be not only counted, but also 
weighed in the light of (a) the climatic and geographic location of the 
city; (b) the architecture of the schoolhouse, together with its hygienic¢ 
condition; (¢) attendance; (d) the number of hours per day and week, 
recesses, and other things. The foundation of hygienic statistics would 
be the medical examination of all pupils at the time of their admission 
* to the school. These data should remain in the hands of a physician, 
and should have reference to weight, size, digestion, pulse curve, ee 
pressure, diseases passed through, abnormalities, and. _Similar_thi 
about which a professional man can best judge? Georg I Hirth 3 nee 
justly that it is a mistake to merely give the age of pupils and not al; 
their condition of health medically certified.—For newly~admitted 
children a record should be established, and Mt least an annual exam- 
ination should take place, which would periodically add items, and thus 
show a rate of progress or deterioration. Side by side with these gen- 
eral data each pupil should have a column of his own in the record, 
which might contain items concerning his nourishment, sleep, condition
-P-A-G-E-518
  460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of place for work and for sleep; that is to say, the amount of light, 
heat, etc. And it would seem very desirable to note down in what 
manner the children fill out the pauses between lessons and sessions. 
Not until a uniformity of execution of such statistical investigations is 
secured will it be possible to judge properly the question of physical 
and mental development of youth; and not until then shall we be able 
to decide the weighty question of overtaxing the brain. 
Some may say that these are plans for the millennium. That may be, 
butif only a few States, small though they be, carry these plans into exe- 
cution, their results will give a standard measure for other schools and 
countries. The German nation has at all times had the duty of per- 
forming mental work to a higher degree than others, being, as it were, 
placed in the geographical center of a continent and endangered from 
all sides, and having to undergo a competitive struggle with all the 
nations of the civilized world. Without great effort in mental labor 
youth can not be instructed successfully, and certainly can not be 
accustomed to prolonged effort unless it is done while the natural pow- 
ers are still plastic. By lowering the demands and yielding to the 
complaints of weaklings the process of degeneration will be accelerated 
and the whole nation will gradually sink to a lower level of culture. 
One thing is plain without any statistics. The more readily the life 
of the nation and the customs of the people return to simplicity, mod- 
esty, and inner health the easier it will be for the school to train a 
healthy race. And again, only when the trainers of the youth are what 
the young generation is to be will their work be successful. Now, the 
trainers of youth, however, are not merely the teachers in school, but 
every one whose example is before the youthful eye, and chief among 
them that of the parents. Fence every one must begin with himself. 
Self-control and self-education of the adult are the best discipline of 
youth. If we only preach and leave to others to do the work, we shall 
not succeed in warding off the beginning of degeneration, unless fright- 
ful catastrophes come to our aid. 
IX. NATIONAL FEATURES OF FEMALE EDUCATION. 
By Prof. SrepHaN WAFTZOLDT, councilor of education in Magdeburg, Germany. 
[Published in the official organ of the Prussian minister of public instruction.] 
The science of education has only recently begun to sever itself from 
speculative theories and turn toward historic development of the 
momenta that constitute it. There is still too much system and theo- 
retical construction, while unbiased observation and fixation of facts 
are not as frequently found as desirable. Rarely are the forms of the 
education of a time or of a country viewed in connection with the 
entire development of the people. Comparative pedagogy is still in 1ts 
infancy. The questions, How does a nation, an era, a society arrive at
-P-A-G-E-519
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 461 
a particular form of education? and, Why is it a historically neces- 
sary result? present themselves to us. 
He who has accustomed himself to understand historically that which 
exists in the education of our people, and compares it with the work and 
the results of other nations upon similar lines, will not be apt to believe 
in the possibility or utility of direct copies and adaptations, he will try 
to understand and to explain, but will refrain from copying; for in the 
end every nation finds that which is best adapted to its needs, and 
finds it in its own way. : 
Such considerations crowd themselves upon us when we view the edu- 
cation of women of our era, when we try to find the ways it is to go 
and the aims it is to seek. May I be permitted to suggest a few char- 
acteristic features of woman’s education as found in nations akin to 
ours? Let us not forget that the most pressing necessity is not found’ 
in universities for women, nor in the participation of women in the 
scientific labor of the times, ner in the opening of higher professions 
for women, but in the care and extensive education of the millions of 
girls, indeed, for the education of the mothers of the coming genera- 
tions. The graceful structures of a higher education and the capstone 
of the edifice will remain insecure until they can rest upon the broad 
and secure foundation of a general education of the people. A State 
which neglects this and promotes higher education exclusively works 
for show, and neglects the general weal of the people while it may 
satisfy the desires and claims of a noisy minority. Let us not forget 
that more important than the results of intellectual education, which 
are easily recognized and estimated, are the ethical effects of edueation 
which are taken into life and manifest themselves as determination of 
the will, a quality which is not easily estimated, because not visible to 
the eye. 
Some uniform historical features of woman’s education are found in 
the nations of the Occident; thus, for instance, in the early Middle 
Ages the beginning of higher education was more frequently found 
among the women of the nobility than among the men. At that time 
there was no appreciable difference between the intellectual education 
of women and men. At the close of the Middle Ages, Vives lamented 
the fact that the female sex was almost everywhere excluded from in- 
tellectual light. In the epoch of the birth of the modern state and the 
modern man, in the era of the Renaissance, there came up in France, 
in Italy, and in Germany the question of female education simul- 
taneously with the consciousness of personal rights and duties. The 
Reformation then separated, as it were, the two worlds, and created 
two kinds of culture, the Germanic Protestant and the Romanic 
Catholic. Female education in the Romanic countries remained in the 
hands of the church and within the walls of convents, while in Ger- 
manic countries it was extended and liberated by the influences of 
Protestantism.
-P-A-G-E-520
  A462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Once more the civilized. world of western Europe was stirred up by 
a current of new ideas during the era of enlightenment and humanity. 
In pamphlets, profound books, romances, and comedies theorizing was 
indulged in concerning the education of women; it was considered a 
purely human education. Even the poet Jean Paul thinks the woman 
happy because she alone, without reference to the demands of a pro- 
fession or an occupation, could indulge in educating herself to pure 
humanity. There seemed to be no need for any special education for 
her. Necessity, the great specter, did not, as yet, knock at her door. 
But at about the middle of this century the problem of finding occu- 
pation for women outside of the family arose simultaneously in all 
industrial states, and with itarose the necessity for special preparation 
for distinet professions, which necessity was derived from the ever- 
increasing difficulties of the hard battle of life. The machine had 
actually taken the work out of the hands of the women; the number 
of single women without occupation grew rapidly, especially in the 
middle strata of the people. Hence the problem of woman’s education 
became of general interest to society and the state. Meanwhile, in 
the Atlantic States of the New World a type of women, psychically 
foreign to the Old World, has been formed, a new ideal of womanhood 
and woman’s occupation. The American woman appears on the stage. 
Eyery nation and every era entertains an ideal of the woman accord- 
ing to which it intends to educate the girls. This ideal may change, 
but it bears abiding national features. Poets sketch it, and in writings 
on woman’s education it is reflected. In France this ideal consisted 
for a long time in the “honnéte femme,” in the sense of Moliére; this 
gradually changed to the “femme du monde,” meaning the word in an 
acceptable sense; finally this ideal assumed the features of the “cito- 
yenne.” In England the type of the wife of a country gentleman or a 
clergyman, that is of the gentle lady seems to have predominated. In 
Germany the ideal bears the dear features of a pious, good “haus-frau,” 
which the shy, demure maiden is to take as her model. These ideal 
pictures are becoming dim in outline everywhere. Something new is 
wanted. Shall it be the “femme savante”? We are aware of the fact 
that the aforementioned types are those of the women of middle and 
well-to-do classes. It was much later that consideration was bestowed 
upon the children of the people—that is, the daughters of peasants, 
workingmen, and skilled laborers. Only one State has the proud satis- 
faction of having done so very early, and that is Prussia. 
Woman’s education in France, as in all other Romanic countries, 
was determined exclusively by the views of the church, both with 
reference to contents and form. Only at a very late period and, as it 
were, in leaps the development of public girls’ schools took place. Up 
to the Revolution (1789) France had no elementary schools for girls. 
The duty of the State to take care of the education of girls was first 
recognized in a bill advocated by Talleyzand in the year 1791. ‘That
-P-A-G-E-521
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 463 
pill provided that schools should be established for cases in which the 
education of girls in the family was found impossible or inadequate, 
and it was based on the principle that girls should be trained for the 
family and in the family. The idea of schools for girls returned to the 
surface under Condorcet. He demanded that up to a certain age 
instruction should be given to both boys and girls simultaneously; 
hence I believe I have found in his plan the beginning of the idea 
expressed in America by the term coeducation. Neither Condorcet’s 
plan nor Lakanal’s law of the year 1794, which resulted from that plan, 
was ever realized. The Republic, it is true, had passed the law, but 
it had not the teachers to execute it. In the great Napoleonic system 
of a university of France, which embraced all public institutions of 
learning in the land, woman’s education found no place. When, in 1793, 
the liberty of instruction had been proclaimed, girls’ education passed 
over into the hands of the clergy and private boarding schools, which 
were managed according to the views of Madam Campan. Even 
to-day the French rural population prefers girls’ elementary schools 
taught and managed by nuns or “sisters,” and for daughters of the 
highest strata of society convent education is considered the only cor- 
rect education. From this arises, in France and in other Romanic coun- 
tries, a peculiar contrast between the views of the world as held by the 
men and the women of the same nation, while with Germans and the 
English people in the most extensive strata the education of both 
sexes is essentially the same (girls and boys in the villages attend the 
same school, have the same teachers, and are taught according to the 
same principles and the same course of study); in France the two 
sexes are actually, by means of education, led to different religious 
and political views and principles. To close this gap it was thought 
to educate the girls above all to a “citoyenne,” but the new laws, in 
operation since 1872, have not been able to accomplish that as yet. 
Elementary education for girls was first secured thirty years ago by 
Guizot and Duruy. The important organie elementary school laws of 
1882 and 1886 are intended to result in a new condition of things; they 
are hastening the development of the system and are intended to lay a 
firm foundation. According to these laws every community with more 
than 400 inhabitants is obliged to establish a girls’ school. Except in 
small villages and settlements, all instruction of girls is reserved for 
women teachers. It is characteristic that the organization of general 
elementary instruction of girls under the Third Republic took place 
later than the legal organization of secondary schools for girls, but both 
were undertaken with outspoken political tendency and consciousness 
of definitely breaking with the views of the past. 
Also in the field of secondary education for girls the fundamental 
Jegislative ideas are traced back to the greatest of ministers of instrue- 
tion France ever had, M. Duruy. The law of Camille Sée, of December, 
1880, then created the Lycee de Jeunes Filles upon democratic and 
 
-P-A-G-E-522
    464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
atheistic foundation, and with a strong leaning toward the institutions 
of higher boys’ schools; but at present the desire is felt to bestow more 
attention upon the feminine qualities of the students, or, as the techni- 
cal term has it in France, to ‘‘feminize the programmes.” ‘The system 
of public schools for girls in France has not grown up from below in 
its own organic development, it has not assumed forms caused by the 
changing needs of the time, but it is, so to speak, a construction from 
the idea; the idea rules reality. The admirably clear, consistent struc- 
ture of the entire system is decidedly French. French also are the 
management, the detailed courses of study which go into infinitesimal 
minutie, rules, and regulations. The logical consequences from a reali- 
zation of the plan were drawn regardless of historic facts. To the women 
teachers were opened the same institutions for professional preparation. 
that were open to men; under presuppositions of equality the women 
were admitted to the State examinations; the admission of women to 
university studies was facilitated; higher normal schoo]s for women 
teachers intending to teach in secondary schools were established. In 
the same measure, however, in which woman’s education in France 
entered the arena of public education the girls found themselves 
exposed unsparingly to the customary contention caused by ambition 
for prizes, diplomas, scholarships, etc. Competition and rivalry in 
examinations increased. The human being who is that by the grace 
of examinations only is now being bred and trained in girls’ schools of 
France also; the external success has become an essential motive, and 
the easily teachable mediocrity wins the victory. Outside of large 
cities this new girls’ school of France finds little support. Church, 
family, and the people’s instinct conduct a secret war against it with 
zeal and vigor. Let us not be blind to the fact that in judging the 
effect of the whole system the metropolitan institutions and results are 
not the proper standard. 
To sum up, modern France, in accordance with the tendeney of the 
national spirit, which leans toward logical construction, built up its 
system of female education rather more in obedience to an idea than to 
pressing needs. 
Quite different was the way England proceeded. England is the 
classical land of historical forms, of vigorous individuality, of creative 
associations, of self-government and self-administration, the land of 
practical purposes. Education in England is supported by the family, 
the church, corporations, and school communities. The State, as such, 
participates in the management of the school system directly only in 
one way, namely, as money spender. The State establishes and man- 
ages no schools; it merely supports them and controls the expenditures. 
A difference in principle regarding contents and form has never in 
England existed between the education of boys and girls. Since the 
ancient languages and mathematics are considered to this day as deci- 
sive studies in the two ancient universities, Cambridge and Oxford,
-P-A-G-E-523
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 465 
the young English women of necessity turn in the same direction. Of 
necessity also the preparatory school below the university teaches 
these branches, in the study of which the girls participate. 
Up to the fifth decade of our century England owed its systematic 
efforts in behalf of public education for the children of the people to 
two denominational corporations. It is a peculiar but very evident 
fact that the great Church Reformation in England did not exercise the 
same advantageous influence upon public education that it had done in 
Germany. Its influence was felt more in the higher strata, and not as 
with us among the real people. In Scotland, on the other hand, where 
under Knox the Reformation penetrated all classes of society, there 
developed a general parochial school system, which elevated the Scotch 
elementary schools far above those of England. In England the State 
showed sympathy for the condition and instruction of the children of 
laborers for the first time in the forties by passing factory laws. Lord 
Cranborne expressed the opinion in the House of Commons that it was 
better for children to work in factories than to learn all sorts of useless 
trash in poorly ventilated schoolrooms. This was the time when Par- 
liament made the first appropriation for school buildings and created a 
royal school authority, which had power to appoint inspectors, whose 
duty it was to watch over the expenditures of the appropriations, which 
were not regular but provisional. This money was distributed, and is 
to this day distributed, according to a badly reputed system of payment 
by results. Normal schools for the professional preparation of teach- 
ers were and are now very inadequate in number and extent. The 
so-called monitorial system in vogue in Lancaster’s schools was gener- 
ally adopted, and has been replaced by a system of pupil teachers, 
which is in use to the present day. All schools were private or church 
schools. Large, rapidly growing, industrial cities, numbering hundreds 
of thousands of inhabitants, had almost no schools for the masses. On 
August 9, 1870, after the extension of the franchise, Parliament passed 
the elementary school law. Within fourteen years after the passage of 
that law the number of school children increased from 1,000,000 to 
4,000,000. Forster’s law exclusively regulated the external affairs 
of the people’s schools and conscientiously guaranteed the liberty of 
communities and their right to self-government. Nevertheless the law 
met with violent opposition, and its enemies have not all disappeared 
yet. “For the first time,” said a clergyman, “in the history of England 
a despotic power lays tracks for the human mind.” Opposition to com- 
pulsory education is not entirely vanquished to this day. As is done 
in France, a large percentage of the children leave school at the con- 
clusion of the eleventh year of age. In the streets of large cities, on 
the moors, and in the fields of the open country there are still roaming 
many hundreds of girls who receive no instruction, and still more of 
them would never see the inside of a school did not charity reach out 
its helping and saving hand.

  466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The institutions of England for higher education of women have been 
frequently discussed with us during the last few years. But all these 
institutions and enterprises are for the benefit of the daughters of a 
minority which, according to German standards, are well-to-do. All 
these institutions are based upon peculiar national English customs 
and traits, both of life and education. They are all private enterprises, 
neither demanding nor expecting anything from the State—institutions 
that would jealously decline interference on the part of authority. No 
course of study accepted and confirmed by the State binds them; their 
establishment and management, their methods and aim, are not subject 
to State control. Those numerous well-educated and socially well- 
regarded but poor families that we find in Germany representing the 
army officers, the higher civil officers, the judiciary, the teachers, and 
the clergy, are entirely wanting in England, where the two extremes, 
wealth and poverty, touch each other. The irony in the contrast 
between the education given to the broad strata of the people and the 
luxury of education offered to the wealthy is very plainly noticeable in 
the education of the girls. From the elementary school there is no way 
into the well-equipped high schools and colleges for women, But it is 
gratifying to observe the self-dependence, the energy, the tenacity 
with which English women conquer and successfully maintain the pos- 
sibilities of culture which areopen tomen. Higher education for women 
in England is entirely the work of English women. All institutions 
serving it stand under woman’s direction and employ almost exclusively 
female teachers. This enormous growth is the work of scarcely more 
than thirty years, but centuries had prepared the way by creating for 
the English woman of the higher classes that prominent position she 
occupies in the family, in society, in the moral and intellectual life of 
the nation. 
Characteristically English is, on the other hand, the exclusive direc- 
tion of girls’ education upon a practical aim obtainable by an examina- 
tion. To express it in brief, there is a desire for an education according 
to pattern and stamp. It is not the free development of an intellectual 
personality, but of the final performances in examination to which the 
work of long years is directed. From the smallest local examination 
to the much-dreaded tripos at Cambridge there is spanned across the 
globe a net of English examinations. No one intending to reach the 
end can escape its meshes. It is expected and demanded of every 
pupil and of every student that his or her work be a preparation for an 
examination in view. We therefore find, in place of general humane 
education, a specialization which begins too early; instead of the free, 
unhindered work of a teacher, a laborious drudgery in mastering a 
certain amount of prescribed knowledge—prescribed, of course, by an 
examination. I vividly remember the flaming protest published in the 
fall of 1888 in the Nineteenth Century Magazine by 396 men of science 
and public life against this system, which crushes the most talented and 
   
-P-A-G-E-525
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 467 
best intellects among girls and boys, and distorts the aim of education 
and transfers the principle of the race track and its technical term, 
“training,” upon intellectual performances. This weighty protest gave 
rise to the appointment of a royal commission of inquiry into the ques- 
tions of secondary education. The result of the commission’s work 
has recently been published, and aims at an improvement of the boys’ 
education, which will of necessity also promote and improve girls’ 
secondary education. 
English, Dutch, and French colonists transplanted the ancient Euro- 
pean culture into the new land across the water. The women of the 
early settlers learned to brave the dangers of loneliness and wilderness. 
The conditions of their lives were favorable for the development of 
independent character and strong will. Women are rare at first in colo- 
nies, hence the charm they give to the house, and the grace and steadi- 
ness they bestow upon a roving existence is valued highly and bought 
dearly. The American women defend right, morals, and good manners 
inexorably. While rough combat for life and sustenance claims the 
men, the finer intellectual interests are readily yielded to women. The 
richer and easier the gain is, on new soil, the more will domestic care 
diminish. Immense distances gave to the American character some- 
thing expansive, a feeling of unlimited possibilities for life, activity, and 
gain; a joyful elasticity of soul, a consciousness that nothing human is 
beyond his reach. These traits are found in the American woman also. 
She is accustomed to claim consideration for her free self-determination; 
her inclinations and aspirations scarcely find opposition in state and 
society; she wants to enjoy equal rights, but also claims equal duties. 
The circumscribed world of her home has become too small for her, 
Her ruling influence in education and questions of culture is advancing 
into the older Atlantic States. No difference is made between boys and 
girls in education in the United States. From the primer to the doc- 
tor’s hat there is free intellectual competition for both sexes on the 
same school benches, in the same lecture room, under the same profess- 
ors. A great hunger for education characterizes the American man, 
and even more so the American woman. The importance of schools 
for the public weal can never be valued higher than it is done in the 
United States. Women form the majority of the participants in edu- 
cational congresses. The powerful movement on foot in favor of popu- 
lar high schools, the so-called university extension, which had its rise 
in England, is essentially supported by women. Young ladies and 
women of more advanced age take up their residence in the slums of 
metropolitan cities in order to establish social settlements for the 
express purpose of forming a nucleus for education and improvement 
of the forsaken and abandoned. Girls are in the majority in the upper 
grades of the public schools as well as the high schools, and with the 
exception of universities and colleges the female sex takes the front 
rank among teachers and learners. The majority of all schools in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-526
  468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
United States maintain coeducation. That boys are to be educated to 
be men, that girls are to be women, and hence that they must be edu- 
cated differently—this self-evident principle seems to be forgotten in 
America, Already nature begins to avenge herself. The American 
woman is slowly degenerating in consequence of her emancipation. 
As she leaves the sphere of her home to enter the great market of 
life she becomes less able and willing to fulfill natural duties. This is 
the opinion of distinguished physicians and clergymen. The woman 
question will, in the near future, assume a new aspect in the American 
Commonwealth. It will then no longer be able to disregard the phys- 
ical and mental difference in sex which nature and civilization have 
created, and for the sake of the continuance of the state which can not 
be guaranteed for all time to come by vast supplies of immigrants from 
the Old World, the American education of women will have to obey the 
dictates of nature again. 
Let us return to the conditions in our own country. Luther thought 
that the magistrates of all the cities in Germany should establish good 
schools both for boys and girls. The Prussian kings from Frederick 
William the First, whose order in the year 1717 laid the foundation for 
compulsory school attendance, made no difference between boys and 
girls in public education. The Reformation and the Hohenzollern 
dynasty created the Prussian people’s school, and this institution 
serves both sexes equally. As a quantité négligeable may be con- 
sidered the number of girls between 6 and 14 in Prussia who are not 
enjoying regular instruction by professionally prepared teachers hold- 
ing State diplomas. That which is wanting in the people’s schools is a 
sufficient number of female teachers, whose educative influence upon 
the girls of the upper grades could do much good in the domestic and 
moral habits of our rural population. In Russia thousands of women 
teachers keep up a fight against the powers of darkness in the most 
remote hamlets and villages. With us here in Germany very few 
women teachers are willing to serve as rural school-teachers and take 
upon themselves the duties which presuppose a renunciation of social 
and other comforts; they all rush toward the cities. The problem of 
female teachers has with us been considered exclusively a question 
concerning city schools. 
I take it for granted that you are acquainted with the history and 
development of our secondary schools for girls. The external charac- 
teristic historical momenta are: (1) Gradual growth of private founda- 
tions; (2) slow formation of aims and method in close contact with the 
needs of the time; (3) then active participation of the communities in 
establishing and maintaining public secondary schools for girls; (4) a 
tendency to extend these schools to make them normal schools for the 
preparation of female teachers; (5) a great variety in courses of study 
and division into classes, from which variety only in recent years a 
uniform type has developed. I may also mention the fact that the  
-P-A-G-E-527
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 469 
State left these schools alone for many years and spent all its strength 
and means upon the people’s and the boys’ preparatory schools. It did 
this with the well-understood object in view to prepare the officers of 
the State and the leaders of the nation. Only with hesitation the State 
authorities began to subject the girls’ schools to regulations such as 
were issued for boys’ schools. 
These are the external characteristics, but there are also internal 
characteristics. They are: (1) The religious-ethical spirit of the whole; 
(2) the preponderance of men teachers, especially in the upper grades 
andin the educative branches; (3) the one-sided attention to literary, 
esthetic interests, of which the disproportionate importance given to 
history of literature is a characteristic; (4) finally, the great variety of 
professional preparation of teachers in this kind of school; (5) above 
all, peculiar to these schools is the direction and transmission of a 
general education such as ladies of better situated classes of society 
require. At present the professional preparation has on principle been 
severed from the school of general culture. No examination threatens 
the student at the conclusion of the course of study. The schools 
bestow no honors; give no privileges and no diplomas. These cireum- 
stances give to the instruction of a good, thorough teacher an invalua- 
ple amount of freedom, which permits concentration, absorption, and 
contemplative repose, and in this I recognize an undeniable advantage 
for our schools. 
As yet the lecture rooms of our universities are open only to very 
few women; as yet the professions which do not agree with the constitu- 
tion of woman, and for which the State demands an academic prepara- 
tion, are still closed to them, while in other civilized states the women 
have succeeded in securing admission. Is this fact explained simply 
by the unjust valuation of woman’s work,,by undervaluation of woman’s 
capacity, by the imperiousness of man and his anxiety lest woman’s 
competition will interfere with his success? Let me say, first, that the 
State with us is not only a police institution to protect life and property, 
but its object is the promotion and equalization of all interests of cul- 
ture. It is obliged to ask, with every newly arising claim, whether and 
in how far it meets recognized needs. It is a sound and safe policy of 
the public-school authorities not to interfere with things that are only 
beginning and developing, but to givetimeand space for healthy growth; 
not to feed and nurse young forms artificially, but to wait patiently 
and see whether they have a vigorous life and find good soil among the 
people. To remodel anything ancient that has long stood the test in 
order to introduce something new that has not as yet proved its value 
is always doubtful. Now, with us, as it is well understood, the con- 
dition for academic or university study is the graduation diploma, which 
is granted alone by classical high schools, called gymnasia. But we 
have no gymnasia for young ladies. Shall the State establish them? 
Prussia is not wealthy enough for that, and should we really lead our
-P-A-G-E-528
  470 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
girls upon an educational path which is exclusively designed and 
planned for boys intending to devote themselves to the higher profes- 
sions and offices of the State? Shall we for the girls fix a course of 
study with the authority of the State, a course which many and many 
of us think badly needs reform? When, as in Berlin, Leipsic, and 
Karlsruhe, private gymnasia for girls are established in order to give 
them an education such as the boys’ schools offer, the State authorities 
certainly do not interfere or prohibit it. The first Prussian female 
graduate has passed her examination well. That which is wanting in 
the realm of higher education of women here in Germany is not so 
much favors from the State as great philanthropists, such as Rocke- 
feller and Holloway, and wealthy corporations, such as the Brewers’ 
Guild in London, which gave large donations for the higher education of 
women. Such means flow very scantily in Germany, as the interest 
for our aspirations is not very extended as yet among the people. 
More pressing needs claim the strength and means of the State. 
And yet excellent things have been done with us; three Prussian 
universities have opened the doors of the philosophic faculty to women 
teachers; a scientific examination gives to the best of them a higher 
aim and in their school work a broader track than formerly. We may 
hope that the profession of medicine will be opened to the woman, as 
far as it may become a profession for them, and as far as the needs of 
the State may be congruent with their desires. He who refers to 
America, England, or France in this connection forgets or overlooks 
the fundamental difference in German and foreign universities and the 
culture which they offer. The German university is, as Paulsen states 
it, both a laboratory for scientific investigation and an institution for 
the highest scientific instruction; hence it is more than a higher pro- 
fessional school. The university professor is considered in Germany a 
scientific investigator at the same time that he isa teacher. This unity 
of investigation and instruction gives to the German university its 
peculiar character. But the claims and demands for preparation and 
the conditions of admission are very much higher than in other coun- 
tries, where a student only seeks a limited professional education, as in 
France, or an extension of his general education, as in England and 
America. 
An institution like the Victoria Lyceum here in Berlin would, if it 
were established in England or the United States, unquestionably 
be called a university. Look at its list of lecture courses of a single 
academic year. There is scarcely one of the great sciences that is 
not represented. The list of professors exhibits distinguished names 
in philosophic, economic, historic, philologic, geographic, and physical 
investigation. For the first time in the history of this school a theo- 
logical course and physiological lectures are opened. Almost all the 
fields of mental life are cultivated. Its work is greater and more pro- 
found than that of many a foreign university, hence we have every 
 
-P-A-G-E-529
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. AT1 
reason to rejoice over our accomplishments, though we are fully aware 
of the fact that much is still to be done. 
To look at that which is our own must not narrow down our mind, 
must not. prevent us from looking beyond our own boundaries and 
appreciating what others have done; attainments in foreign countries 
will induce us to renewed efforts. With reference to the higher educa- 
tion of women in Germany, let us proudly quote Goethe’s words: “This 
much is ours, this much let us maintain.” And let us add: “Upon this 
foundation let us continue to build.” 
X.—PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN THE GRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBURG.! 
In the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg (area, 1,000 square miles; popu- 
lation, 212,000) there were, in the year 1894-95, 3 gymnasiums or col- 
leges, 1 commercial and industrial school, 1 agricultural school, 1 
normal school, 755 primary schools, 8 girls’ boarding schools, 26 day 
nurseries, and 499 schools for adults. 
Of the higher institutions of learning, the progymnasium at Echter- 
nach had 10 professors and 93 students; the gymnasium at Diekirch 
16 professors and 246 students; the gymnasium at Luxemburg 25 pro- 
fessors and 507 students; the commercial and industrial school at Lux- 
emburg 24 professors and 322 students. 
The course of study in these gymnasiums covered the following 
branches: The German, French, Latin, and Greek languages; religion, 
mathematics, history, geography, zoology, botany, physics, philosophy, 
drawing, and gymnastics. The study of the English language was 
not compulsory. 
The branches taught in the industrial school were: Religion; the 
German, French, and English languages; mathematics, history, 
geography, physics, drawing, and stenography. 
The following branches were taught in the commercial school: 
Religion; the German, French, and English languages (Spanish and 
Italian were optional); history, geography, commercial arithmetic, 
commercial science, commercial law, commercial correspondence, 
technology, political economy, and stenography. 
The Luxemburg gymnasium and the industrial and commercial school 
together form the Luxemburg Atheneum, an institution with 49 pro- 
fessors and 829 students. 
Applicants for admission to the lowest class of any of these colleges 
must be at least 12 years of age. The course of instruction occupies 
six years. In the industrial and commercial school each pupil pays 
for tuition in the three lower classes $8 per annum; in the three 
higher classes, $12 per annum. At the gymnasium in Diekirch the 
charge for tuition ranges from $8 to $10 per annum. In the other 
1 Reported by George H. Murphy, vice-commercial agent.

  472 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
gymnasiums tuition is free to needy pupils who pass their examina- 
tions ereditably. 
The-total amount paid by the Government in salaries to the 75 pro- 
fessors in these four colleges is about $52,000 per annum, the average 
salary being $700. 
The so-called schools for adults were, in the year just ended, mostly 
(466) public schools. There were 336 schools for males, with 5,069 
pupils, and 130 for females, with 3,090 pupils. Most of these pupils 
were from 13 to 18 years of age. A large majority of the schools were 
open less than five months during the year, and even then only for a 
few hours once or twice a week. In 24 of the boys’ schools only draw- 
ing was taught. In the others instruction was given in from two to five 
branches: Drawing, arithmetic, geometry, bookkeeping, and German or 
French. 
Of the 130 girls’ schools, 43 were devoted entirely to needlework. 
Instruction was given in the others in from three to eight branches: 
Needlework, arithmetic, bookkeeping, housekeeping, hygiene, natural 
sciences, and German or French. 
Most of the teachers in these schools were regular primary school- 
teachers, who in this way added a small amount to their incomes. The 
entire amount paid to the teachers of these 466 schools for adults was 
about $11,600, an average of less than $25 per teacher.

THE NETHERLANDS. 
I. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. 
The first constitution of the Netherlands after its reconstruction as 
a kingdom was adopted in 1815 and revised in 1848 and 1887. By 
virtue of this charter the Netherlands is a constitutional hereditary 
monarchy. 
The executive power of the State belongs exclusively to the Sovereign, 
while the whole legislative authority rests conjointly in the Sovereign 
and Parliament, the latter consisting of two chambers, called the 
States-General. The Upper or First Chamber is composed of 50 mem- 
bers, elected by the 11 States from the highest assessed inhabitants 
and from certain high and important officials specified by law. The 
Second Chamber of the States-General numbers 100 deputies and is 
elected directly from among all the male citizens who are 30 years of 
age and are not deprived by judicial sentence of their eligibility or the 
administration and the disposal of their property. 
The Government and the Second Chamber only have the right of in- 
troducing new bills, the functions of the Upper Chamber being restricted 
to approving or rejecting them, without the right of amendment. 
II, LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 
The territory of the Netherlands is divided into 11 provinces and 
1,123 communes. 
Each province has its own representative body, “The provincial 
states.” The members are elected for six years directly from among 
the male Dutch inhabitants of the province who are 25 years of age, 
one-half of the members retiring every three years. The form of elec- 
tion and the mode of procedure in this body are the same as that for the 
Second Chamber of the States-General. Voters must be inhabitants of 
the province. Representation is based on the population of the proy- 
ince, and numbers from 80 for South Holland to 35 for Drenthe The 
provincial states are entitled to make ordinances concerning the welfare 
of the province, and to raise taxes in accordance with the law. All 
provincial ordinances must be approved by the King. The provincial 
states exercise the right of control over the municipalities and elect 
members of the Upper Chamber of the States-General, and see that

the common law is executed in their provinces. They meet twice a 
year, as arule, in public. A permanent commission, composed of 6 of 
their members, called the states deputies, is charged with the executive 
power in the province and the administration of its affairs. Both the 
deputies and the provincial states are presided over by a commissioner 
appointed by the Sovereign, who in the former assembly has a deciding 
vote, but in the latter only a deliberative voice. He is the chief magis- 
trate of the province. Only the members of the states deputies receive 
an allowance. 
Hach of the communes forms a corporation, with its own interests 
and rights, subject to the general law. Every commune has a council 
elected for six years by the same voters as for the provincial states, 
provided they are inhabitants of the commune; one-third of the coun- 
cil retires every two years. All the Dutch male inhabitants of 23 
years of age are eligible for the council, the membership of which 
varies from 7 to 39, according to population. These councils have the 
right of making and enforcing by-laws concerning the communal wel- 
fare; they may raise taxes according to rules prescribed by common 
law, and each commune receives a fixed annual allowance out of the 
State treasury. All by-laws may be vetoed by the Sovereign. The 
municipal budget and the resolutions to alienate municipal property 
require the approbation of the states deputies of the province. The 
council meets in public as often as may be necessary, and is presided 
over by a mayor, appointed by the Sovereign for six years. The execu- 
tive power is vested in a college formed by the mayor and two, three, 
or four aldermen elected by the council. This college is also charged 
with the execution of the common law. The municipal police is under 
the authority of the mayor, and as a State functionary the mayor super- 
vises the actions of the council, and may suspend their resolutions for 
thirty days, but is bound when so doing to inform the states deputies 
of the province. 
The area of the Netherlands is 12,648 English square miles. 
Population, 4,732,911, according to census of December 31, 1893, or 
372.20 inhabitants per square mile. Of the total population in 1893, 
there were 2,341,484 males and 2,391,427 females. 
Religion.—According to the terms of the constitution, entire liberty 
of conscience and complete social equality are granted to the members 
of all religious denominations. 
HISTORICAL SKETCH OF EDUCATION. 
Holland has always been among the leading countries of Europe in 
the educational line; in fact, the Dutch Government was the first one 
in this century to promulgate official school laws, viz, in 1801, 1803, 
and 1806, 
The first school known in Holland was founded in Utrecht by Wille- 
brod, the first bishop of the Frisians, who in 690 landed on the shores
-P-A-G-E-536

of the Netherlands. This school attained great fame, and it is said that 
Pepin, the son of Charles Martel, was educated there. The educational 
influence of the apostle of the Germans, St. Boniface, was very notice- 
able. Under Gregory, one of his scholars, this town assembled within 
its walls the studious youths from all the neighboring countries (quidam 
autem et de Baguarus et Suevis). During the invasion of the Nor- 
mans this school was suspended, but in the year 917 it was reestab- 
lished, and soonattained its former splendor. The three sonsof Emperor 
Heinrich der Vogler (Henry the Fowler), Otto, Heinrich, and Bruno, 
were educated there. The latter, who was Duke of Lorraine, while 
archbishop of Cologne, was known for his great learning. In the begin- 
ning of the twelfth century Utrecht had no less than 5 flourishing 
schools, some of which had, besides the clergymen, who were superin- 
tendents, a rector scholarum. 
Atthe same period several monasteries achieved distinction as schools 
of learning, among them those of Egmond, Nijmegen, Middelburg in 
Zealand, and Adouwert near Groningen. During the twelfth century 
the influential communes of Holland and Belgium established, in addi- 
tion to the cathedral, cloister, and ecclesiastical institutions, communal 
schools for the burghers and the common people. - The privilege to 
open such schools was always obtained from a count, who conferred 
it either upon cities or private individuals as a special favor. The 
instruction in the communal schools in Holland, unlike those in Bel- 
gium, was withdrawn entirely from the supervision of the clergy and 
became essentially secular. Grants were made to the following cities: 
To Dortrecht in 1290, by Count Floris V; ’sGravenhage 1322, Leyden 
1324, Rotterdam 1328, ete., by William III; Delft and Amsterdam 
1334, by William IV; Leyden again in 1357, Haarlem 1389, Alkmar 
1398, Hoorn 1358 and 1390, The Hague 1393, Schiedam and Oudewater 
1394, Rotterdam 1402, by Albert of Bavaria. The Dutch communal 
schools were divided into principal and branch schools, and in the 
former Latin was taught. John Cele’s school, which was of this class, 
enjoyed an excellent reputation in the fourteenth century, and is said 
to have numbered as high as 1,000 pupils of all nationalities. The 
Hieronymians, who founded the Society of the Brethren of Life, estab- 
lished numerous schools during the fifteenth century, in which the poor 
were taught gratuitously. 
The first university of Holland, in Leyden, was founded by William 
the Silent in 1575; a second was established at Franeker in 1585; and 
in the eighteenth century three universities were opened, respectively, 
at Utrecht, 1638, Groningen, 1644, and at Herderwijk in 1648. Many 
celebrated men of science and philosophy occupied chairs at these insti- 
tutions, including Grotius, Spinoza, Dousa, Huyghens, Gronovius, Hein- 
sius, Perizonius, Raphelengius, Schultens, Meursius, and Boerhave. 
The learned Pope Hadrian IV was born in Utrecht. The universities 
and Latin schools maintained their reputation during the eighteenth

EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 419 
century, but popular instruction was not developed in the same degree, 
for the methods used were purely mechanical and tended to extinguish 
the intelligence of the pupils rather than stimulate it. 
At the beginning of the nineteenth century (1811) Cuvier made rather 
an unfavorable report on the condition of the universities and Latin 
schools of Holland. The government established by Napoleon I intro- 
duced certain reforms which were subsequently ratified and developed 
by King William I. Dutch legislation regarding primary instruction 
has attracted the attention not only of writers, but of the Governments 
of various countries, on account of its hostility to the principle of denom- 
inational schools. The first impulse to an improved system of primary 
instruction in Holland was given by John Nieuvenhuysen, a Mennonite 
clergyman in Groningen, who founded in that city in 1784 the Society 
of Publie Good (Maatschappij tot Nut van’t Algemeen), whose objects 
were to promote elementary instruction—moral, social, and religious. 
This society was very successful and the Government supported it inits 
efforts. The basis of the Dutch system was laid in the celebrated law 
of 1806, prepared by M. van den Ende. This school law remained 
unchanged until 1857, when amendments were made. The primary 
instruction act of 1857 was supplemented by another act of August 
18, 1879, making important alterations which tended to extend public 
education. It was again considerably altered by the act of December, 
1889. This last act gave unrestricted liberty to the establishing of 
private schools whereby public instruction is diminished. The Govern- 
ment, however, retained absolute supervision of all private schools. 
The constitution of 1848 placed all religious denominations on an equal 
footing. The principle of secular and coeducational schools had at first 
the assent and support of ministers ef every creed, including the Roman 
Catholies; but after 1848 a general opposition developed against this 
plan. A new party of orthodox Protestants started, named after Groen 
van Prinsterer, a prominent professor and writer, and these claimed that 
the Roman Catholics were strictly carrying into execution the law of 
1806, as they excluded in their teaching everything of a doctrinal char- 
acter, even the Bible itself. In the endeavor to check the anticipated 
advances of the church the Groenists, who were in a small minority in 
the chambers of 1857, when the new educational law was framed, 
attacked the principle of the schools, denouncing them as breeding 
places of atheism and immorality and demanding in their place denom- 
inational schools which should provide religious instruction. The 
majority was composed of Roman Catholics who preferred to exclude 
religious instruction entirely from the schools rather than it should 
inculeate Protestant ideas, liberals who were in favor of a total separa- 
tion of church and state, and dissenters of every denomination. The 
important question of denominational and nondenominational schools 
was fully discussed in the legislature. The result was that the nonde- 
nominational character of the school system was maintained, but with
-P-A-G-E-538
  480 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
modifications of its general details. The retention of the word “Chris- 
tian” education in the law gave great offense to many members of the 
Liberal party favoring nondenominational schools, but the Roman 
Catholics especially insisted upon expunging the word “ Christian,” as 
they declared that practically it meant Protestant, and most of them 
voted against the law because the word “Christian” was retained. 
The law, however, was passed by a large majority and public instruction 
in Holland remained nominally Christian, but in’a sense so broad that 
it would have been expressed better by the term “moral.” The law of 
1857 provided that while public instruction should impart all necessary 
secular knowledge and develop the understanding of the pupils, it 
should at the same time train them to the practice of every Christian 
and social virtue, and also provided that primary schools should be 
conducted at the expense of the communes. Two modifications had 
taken place in the Dutch school system from 1806 to 1848, to wit, the 
establishment of normal schools in 1816 as an integral part of the sys- 
tem, and a change in the administration of the private schools for the 
middle classes, for these were found upon inspection to be inferior to 
the public schools, which were originally intended for the poor. 
To enter the public schools a certificate of poverty was demanded, 
which virtually excluded children of the middle class, and it was 
claimed that the ‘State should provide for the proper education of 
middle-class children as well as the poor, since the middle classes were 
the largest taxpayers in support of primary schools. To meet this 
reasonable demand two grades of public schools were added to the 
school system—French intermediate and the classical schools. Inter- 
mediate schools were therefore established in towns where, by paying a 
fee of from 6 to 10 cents per week, all classes of children could obtain 
an education at public expense. French schools of a superior grade 
were also founded, their course including English and French, other 
modern languages being taught for a higher tuition. Above the French 
schools were placed Latin and classical institutions. The system of 
primary instruction in Holland became, therefore, gradually enlarged, 
so as to include the higher, common, and classical institutions. 
The educational system of Holland is very complicated, inasmuch as 
the various grades of educational establishments are provided for 
separately, each being partly supported by the General Government or 
provinces, communes, or individual citizens, as the case may be. Pri- 
mary instruction includes home and school education. The tuition 
given to children, members of not more than three families, is called 
“home instruction.” All other tuition, including schools for the poor, 
orphan asylums, reformatory schools, charitable institutions, and others 
for the public benefit, is by law designated as “school instruction.” 
Primary schools, which are maintained entirely or conjointly by the 
communes or the State (Government), are considered public schools, and 
all others are private. The law of August 17,1878, provides that every
-P-A-G-E-539
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. A481 
subsidy from a public fund, be it never so small, shall transfer a school 
to the domain of public schools. Consequently the private schools 
mentioned in article 3 of the law of 1857, which, on account of their 
nondenominational character, have obtained a subsidy from publie 
funds, are no longer classed as private schools. They are grouped with 
the public schools and must submit to the rules governing them. In 
the official reports published in Holland these schools are called “sub- 
sidized private schools,” in which charges for tuition may be imposed 
upon all children. 
The question of State subsidies to sectarian private schools pro- 
foundly agitated the people of Holland for almost a whole generation; 
it was finally settled by the law of December 8, 1889, which provided 
that instead of paying each community 30 per cent of all expenses, 
each one should receive from the State a certain amount, determined 
by the number of pupils, and this rule is extended to private and paro- 
chial schools. The State is responsible for 25 per cent of the cost of 
founding or purchasing school buildings. But while State schools are 
under State supervision, parochial schools are not, for there the clergy 
is the ruling power. While formerly the tuition fees of the State 
schools were small, they are now graded in proportion to the State sub- 
sidy. The act of 1889 of course reduced the attendance at the publie 
schools and increased the number of pupils at the private seminaries. 
A sufficient number of schools for all children without distinction of 
denominationsare maintained ineach commune. Neighboring parishes 
may conjointly support schools, and children from different communes 
may be admitted thereto. Opportunities are also given to children to 
continue their education in the so-called “repetition schools.” It is also 
provided that children attending schools shall receive religious instrue- 
tion from special teachers at hours appointed for that purpose. 
The object of primary instruction in the schools is to impart useful 
knowledge and to develop the intellectual powers of the child, as well 
as to train him in all Christian and social virtues. School attendance 
is not compulsory, though this question is a constant theme for dis- 
cussion in the legislature. For neglected children there are charity 
“particular” schools, but they may be admitted to training institutions 
and educated therein. 
The provisions of the law for the inspection and management of 
schools and the due qualification of teachers are two of the most 
important features of the system. Prominent men, like Cuvier (1811), 
Cousin, the great French philosopher and pedagogue (1836), Mr. 
Nichols (1838), Dr. Bache (1838), Mr. Hickson (1840), in their reports 
on education in Holland have dwelt largely on these points, and their 
conclusions have had great influence in producing the present superior 
condition of the Dutch schools. 
One unfavorable feature of the common schools in Holland is the 
overcrowding of the classes. From 40 to 50 children are considered 
ED 95: 16  
-P-A-G-E-540
  482 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the maximum number in a class, but these limits, not being specified 
by law, are frequently overstepped. In many places, usually in cities, 
these conditions are so unfavorable that the Government schools are 
not able to meet their requirements when not assisted by private 
schools. 
The Government report shows that 10.88 per cent of ‘the children of 
school age (6 to 12) did not receive instruction during the year 1889. 
Out of 10,386 conscripts 91 per cent could read and write; 151, or 1.45 
per cent, could only read, and 800, or 7.55 per cent, could neither read 
nor write; the highest percentage of illiteracy, 11.06, being in North 
Brabant. 
M. Cuvier, in his report on coeducation in Holland, 1811, says, in 
regard to the subject of coeducation: 
It being contrary to the customs of our country, we were rather shocked to find 
that both sexes were admitted to the same schools. The authorities, however, 
assured us that they never had cause to regret this arrangement. It is the custom 
not only in schools for the poor but in all burgher schools, in which parents pay quite 
high tuition fees and have ample means to send their children to private schools, 
M. Cousin, in his report of 1836, says, on the same subject: 
One thing that surprised me greatly about these schools is that both sexes are 
admitted not only to the same rooms, but are seated side by side on the benches. 
In the Revue Pédagogique Belge, February 15, 1895, we read: 
The greater number of schools in the Netherlands are coeducational. Coeducation 
of the sexes, which was prohibited in France a century ago by the immortal Con- 
dorcet, is in the Netherlands an established principle of pedagogy, and successfully 
applied. Girls and boys of primary schools are in general educated together from 
their sixth to their twelfth year, inclusive. In the lower classes the boys are 
instructed by women teachers. Compulsory instruction has not yet been settled by 
law; yet there are at present very few children not attending some primary school. 
The following extracts from the Reyue Pédagogique Belge for March 
15, 1894, are given, as they present some interesting points of infor- 
mation: 
The school law, passed in December, 1889, substituted for article 54 certain condi- 
tions under which free schools may receive support from the Government, which are 
as follows: 
1, Instruction must comprise: (a) reading; (b) writing; (c) arithmetic; (d) ele- 
ments of the Dutch language; (e) history of the country; (f) geography; (g) rudi- 
ments of natural sciences; (h) singing; (i) elements of drawing; (j) free gymnastic 
exercises and deportment. 
2. In girls’ schools: (k) the useful branches of manual training, provided that the 
pupils do not receive satisfactory instruction somewhere else in this branch. 
3. Instruction for girls must comprise at least eighteen hours per week, of which 
two are devoted to manual labor. 
A time-table must be sent to the inspector of the arrondissement, one copy of 
which must be posted at the school, in a place where it can be seen by all, including 
a table indicating holidays and vacations. 
4, The number of teachers must be the same as that fixed for public schools by arti- 
cles 23 and 24 of the law. (a) The school must be directed by a teacher 23 years of 
age or over who has the rank of a head teacher, though the direction may be intrusted 
 
-P-A-G-E-541
  EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 483 
temporarily—but not exceeding six months—to a teacher below 23 years of age who 
isnot of therank mentioned. (b) The director must be aided by an assistant teacher 
when the number of pupils exceeds 40; by at least two teachers when the number 
reaches 90, and for each group of 55 pupils over 90, one additional teacher. 
In order to entitle a free school to a State subsidy, it must have, beginning with 
January, 1894, in addition to the head teacher, the following corps of teachers: 
  
    
    
       
  Pupils. 1894. | 1895. | 1897. | 1899. Pupils. 1894. | 1895. | 1897. | 1899. 
41 to 90. 1 1 1 1 || 310 to 364. 3 | 4 5 6 
91 to 144. 1. 2 2 2 || 365 to 41 4 5 6 7 
145 to 19: 2 2 3 3 || 420 to 474. 5 6 7 8 
200 to 2 3 4 4 || 475 to 529. 6 7 8 9 
255 to 30: 3 3 4 5 
  
All such teachers must hold a diploma furnished by the State board. Schools 
that can not reccive State aid are as follows: (a) Where the pupils above 6 years 
of age do not exceed 25; (b) schools that receive an annual remuneration of 80 
florins or more per pupil; (¢) schools that during six months have not filled the 
vacancy of head teacher by a titulary of that rank or where during four months 
the place of an assistant teacher has been vacant; (d) schools established for 
mercantile purposes. 
A school board desiring a subsidy should address their request to the State depu- 
ties (permanent corps of deputies) of the province in which the school is established. 
Before the 1st day of May the State deputies must decide whether the school is 
conducted according to the rules of the law, and if so, they determine the amount 
of State aid to be granted in conformity with article 45 of the law, and send their 
decision without delay to the minister, as well as to the inspector of primary instruc- 
tion and the school board. Within the period of thirty days after the date of this 
finding an appeal may be made by the provincial commissioner, the inspector, or the 
school board. A royal decree regulates the amount of subsidy, and the law pro- 
vides the means of operation. 
The subsidy is calculated wpon the same basis ‘as that fer public schools (see 
regulations of article 45): 
For director: 
School of 90 pupils or less. . 
School of ‘91 to 199 pupils. 120. 60 
School of 200 to 309 pupils --. 160.00 
School of 310 to 419 pupils ._. -- 201.00 
School of 420 pupils or more... 241.00 
For each of the assistant teachers, in agreement with conditions mentioned above: 
School of 41 to 90 pupils $60. 30 
School of 91 pupils and more. 80. 40 
If these assistant teachers have reached their twenty-third year and have the rank 
of a head teacher, $120.60. 
When the staff of teachers exceeds the minimum as determined by article 24 of 
the law, the subvention is increased for 1 teacher to $60.30 where the school has 90 
pupils or less and to $80.40 in a school with 91 to 309 pupils; for 2 teachers or more 
to $80.40 per teacher where the school has 310 pupils and over. 
One should by no means overlook the fact that these figures represent the amount 
of State subvention only, and not the real remuneration of the members of the 
teaching force. The communal teachers have a remuneration fixed by the commu- 
nity according to prescriptions of the law. The nonofficial schools fix the remuner- 
ation of teachers as they please. 
If the school teaches, in addition to the obligatory branches, at least two of the 
following subjects, (1) principles of the French language; (2) principles of the $100.50 
             
-P-A-G-E-542
  
  484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
German language; (3) principles of the English language, or (4) principles of math- 
ematics, the subsidy is increased to $80.40 for 1 teacher where there are 90 pupils or 
Jess; to $100.60 per teacher, with an allowance for two more teachers, if there are 90 
to 199 pupils; and to $100.60 per teacher, with an allowance for three additional 
teachers, if the school numbers 200 pupils and over. 
Instruction can not be given in buildings or on premises that have been condemned 
by the inspector of the medical service as unhealthy or too small for accommodating 
all the children. The inspector must give his reasons for disapprobation in writing 
and send copies of the same to the permanent corps of deputies, the communal 
administration, the school inspector, and the school director. ‘The permanent corps 
of deputies directs the burgomasters and aldermen of the community where such 
premises are situated to publish the declaration. 
An appeal against the inspector’s decision can be made to the permanent corps of 
deputies by (a) the inspector of the school district; (b) the director of the school; 
(c) the proprietor or tenant of the premises; (d) the parents or teachers of the pupils. 
The appeal must be made within thirty days. A final appeal may be addressed to 
the Crown against the decision of the corps of deputies. During the period of 
appeal and until the final decision the instruction may be continued on the premises, 
unless the inspector of the sanitary service has ordered it closed for reasons set forth 
in a written report; but instruction may be recommenced if the inspector of the 
sanitary service declares in writing that the premises have been sufficiently im- 
proved and the number of pupils properly limited. 
The above shows that the law has laid down precise instructions 
concerning subsidies to free schools, so as to prevent the Government 
from sustaining institutions that may be undesirable for any reason. 
A school must be a good school in every respect to entitle it to State 
aid. Communal schools receive State subsidies rated according to the 
number of pupils and teachers and in agreement to the scale given 
above, besides 25 per cent of the expenditures of establishment, 
building, or grounds, in as far as these expenditures are not incumbent 
upon some other party. The rooms of these schools may be put, by 
the communal authority, at the disposal of those who wish to give 
_religious instruction after class hours. Free schools receiving subsidies 
may introduce religious instruction or not; the State does not interfere 
in this matter. The Netherlands adopted the principle of religious 
neutrality in the public schools by the law of 1806, the constitution of 
1846, and the laws of 1857 and 1878. 
At a recent date the Government proposed to the Chambers to sub- 
sidize “middle schools for girls.” This project created opposition on the 
part of the “‘feministes,” to which the ministry has been constrained to 
defer, for it now seems certain that Minister van Houten will abandon 
the idea. The “feministes” make it their aim to suppress the special 
schools for girls. They demand that all middle schools shall be made 
coeducational, and that the Government shall only grant subsidies to 
institutions for both sexes. M. van Houten is personally in favor of 
this theory, as his former writings prove, but the Roman Catholics are 
hostile to the principle of coeducation of the sexes. 
Young girls who desire to devote themselves to the higher education 
attend the courses of the “ gymnasia.” There are in Holland about
-P-A-G-E-543
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 485 
29 of these “ gymnasia,” of which 4 are nonsubsidized. These all belong 
to the communes, which decide whether a gymnasium shall be coeduca- 
tional or reserved exclusively for young men; but in 1894 the Roman 
Catholic provinces of Maestricht and Breda refused to open their gym- 
nasia to young girls. In the Protestant provinces it is different; in 
Rotterdam, for example, there are at present 13, and in Amsterdam 26 
young women attending the courses of such coeducational institutions. 
In every instance the boys show the greatest deference for their girl 
fellow-students. Nothing detrimental to the cause of coeducation has 
been noticed in these schools. 
There are four universities in the Netherlands which admit women 
to their courses. Between 1880-81 and 1893-94 the celebrated Univer- 
sity of Utrecht admitted 118 women students. This year 55 young 
ladies were matriculated; at Groningen 13, Utrecht 16, Leiden 11, and 
at the communal university of Amsterdam 15. Of these young women, 
11 study medicine, 19 philosophy and letters, 12 natural sciences, and 
13 elective branches. 
Holland has but 4 women doctors. The first, Mlle. Aletta Jacobs, 
who has a diploma from Groningen University, established herself in 
Amsterdam on September 15, 1879, after having completed a most 
brilliant course of studies, where she was authorized by Minister Thor- 
becke to practice medicine. Mlle. Jacobs has had the courage to defend 
and propagate in Holland the Malthusian doctrine, and though ridi- 
culed and upbraided at the outset, she has finally succeeded in incul- 
cating her ideas into the minds of many eminent persons of the country. 
The Malthusian Society of Holland, which is constantly increasing in 
adherents, numbers among its honorary members M. 8S. Van Houten, 
the prime minister, and has for its president M. B. H. Heldt, member 
of the States-General. There are also in its rankseother men, distin- 
guished alike for their learning and prominence. Mlle. Jacobs has 
become the wife of one of the most eminent men in Amsterdam, M.G. V. 
Gerittson, who is famous as a financier, and is considered one of the 
foremost orators of the Second Chamber of the States-General. 
Another woman physician, Mme. Du Saar, has made a great reputa- 
tion as an oculist. Mme. Tusschenbroek was many years assistant to 
M. Mendes, of Lyons, who is the first gynecologist of Amsterdam and 
stands high in that branch of his profession. The fourth woman doctor 
is Mme. Johanna C. Spruyt. 
A large number of young girls practice pharmacy, which profession 
seems appropriate to their sex. There are in the Netherlands 727 so- 
called “aides” (assistants), of whom 414 are men and 313 women. But, 
although the Hollandish universities have distributed 15 apothecary 
diplomas to young girls there is not one woman who conducts a private 
pharmacy, though it is said one will shortly be opened in Utrecht, con- 
ducted by Mme. Th. Olivier. 
There are seven women possessing apothecary’s diplomas who prac-
-P-A-G-E-544

tice their profession, among whom are Mme. Alice Grutterink, who is 
chief pharmacist of the Coolsingel Hospital, in Rotterdam; and another 
is pharmacist at the Hospital Wilhelmina, of Amsterdam. Since 1880, 
a lady pharmacist, Mlle. Charlotte Jacobs, who is a sister of Dr. Geritt- 
son, née Aletta Jacobs, has established herself in Batavia, where she 
owns a pharmacy and conducts it with the assistance of her husband. 
There are also in Holland several women dentists and first-class 
nurses, who were trained in the special schools of Croix-Rouge, in La 
Haye, or Croix-Blanche, of Amsterdam. 
Mr. Ipsen, in Vor Ungdom, says: 
The energy with which the education of the higher grades is pursued in Holland 
in the various branches, and the consequent abnormal increase in the learned profes- 
sions has led to serious results. Nervousness, which formerly was exceptional, has 
found a productive soil in the Netherlands, and facts show that knowledge in many 
instances has been bought too dearly. Even the phlegmatic character of the Hol- 
landers can not withstand the pressure, and a reaction has already supervened, whose 
influence, it is hoped, will be felt when a normal equilibrium has been regained. 
SUPERINTENDENCE OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The State supervision of schools, under the supreme control of the 
minister of the interior, isin charge of inspectors, district school super- 
intendents, and superintendents of arrondissements. 
A provincial board is composed of 1 inspector and 1 school superin- 
tendent of each district in the respective provinces. The provincial 
boards of primary instruction meet three times a year, receive the 
reports of all the inspectors, consider the interests of primary educa- 
tion, and make an annual statement to the minister of the interior, who 
has the authority to convoke at the capital an assembly of delegates 
from provincial boards, in order to discuss topics of general educational 
interest. 
The local supervision of schools rests upon the burgomaster and the 
aldermen. 
Inspectors.—There are 3 inspectors, whose jurisdiction embraces from 
8 to 4 provinces each; 25 district school superintendents, 1 for each dis- 
trict; and 1 school superintendent for each of the 94 arrondissements. 
For the sake of greater security, the councilors of a community may also 
appoint commissions to inspect all schools at least twice a year and 
ascertain if the law governing elementary instruction has been carried 
out. 
Communities that may unite to establish and support schools can 
have a commission in common, composed of their burgomaster and 
aldermen, and, according to the amendments of the law of 1878, without 
regard to the number of inhabitants, though formerly the law demanded 
3,000. For communities exceeding this number a special commission 
had to be appointed by the local councils. 
Inspectors are nominated, suspended, or discharged by the King.
-P-A-G-E-545
  EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 487 
They receive in addition to their annual salary an allowance for travel- 
ing and incidental expenses while performing their official duties. 
According to article 77 of the law, inspectors must visit the schools 
and communicate, either orally or in writing, with the district and 
arrondissement school superintendents and the local commissions and 
councils for the purpose of devising means for the improvement of pub- 
lic instruction. They must consult the minister of the interier on offi- 
cial business and submit to him annually a general report on the 
condition of schools, and such report must be based upon written 
reports of the local boards and upon personal and private notes. 
Once a year the inspectors are to be convened by the minister of the 
interior to deliberate upon questions of public education under his 
direction. 
District school superintendents are nominated by the King for life, 
and may be suspended, discharged, or pensioned, where the necessity 
arises, by his authority also. They are sworn in by the minister of the 
interior and are obliged to reside in a locality pointed out to him, and 
may hold another office. 
They shall visit institutions for the training of teachers in their respective dis- 
tricts, attend meetings of the district school superintendents for the purpose of 
discussing school matters, and report annually before the 1st of May to the inspector 
of their district, and send a copy of such report to the States-General. 
Arrondissement school superintendents are nominated by the King 
for a term of six years, but are eligible for renomination. They are 
sworn in before the royal commissioner of the province, and can at any 
time be discharged by the King. These superintendents must reside 
within the borders of their jurisdiction, unless they receive a special 
permit from the minister to live elsewhere. 
They shall keep a vecord of all public and public-private [semipublic] schools in 
their arrondissements and of such teachers employed as are classed under article 8 
ofthe law. They shall have knowledge of the school books used in each school, pay 
stated visits to all normal schools and normal institutions, report to the district 
school superintendent on all school affairs, and attend the meetings of the school 
commissioners, 
The King, as the highest authority, is the final arbitrator on all 
questions arising in school matters concerning the teachers. He 
extends privileges to teachers and grants subsidies to the communes 
for school purposes and fixes the boundaries of school districts, ete. 
The minister of the interior acts as adviser and counselor to the King 
in all these affairs. 
The parish council of Hilversum, in establishing new regulations for 
the appointment of school committees, have recently decreed that two 
women shall be included in each committee. The minister in response 
to an inquiry concerning the legality of this action replied “that the 
law does not prevent women from occupying a place on school commit- 
tees.” The decision was received with applause by the friends of 
education.

Under the law of the Netherlands the term “lager onderwijs” (pri- 
mary instruction) does not apply to— 
(a) Instructors of special branches, as singing, needlework for girls, 
drawing, principles of agriculture, gymnastics, or fancywork. 
(b) Schools in which such branches are exclusively taught. 
(ce) Schools in which children over 6 years of age are not admitted 
and where only preparatory lessons are given. Thus nursery or infant 
schools do not come under the provision of the law, because only pre- 
paratory instruction is imparted to children under 6 years of age. 
These schools, however, are supported both by public and private funds, 
(d) Military instructors. 
(e) Schools for the deaf and dumb, blind, idiots, or for those defective 
in speech.

The foregoing table shows that the number of children over 6 and

number of those who did not receive primary instruction was decreased 
by 10,663 or 14.97 per cent. 
Out of the total population on January 1, 1889, of 4,505,932 inhab- 
itants, there were 601,056 children, 301,997 boys and 299,059 girls of 
school age. Of these, 31,935 boys and 39,386 girls, making a total of 
71,321, or 11.87 per cent, did not receive instruction in public or private 
schools. In 1893-94 this number was 60,658, or 9.67 per cent of all the 
children of school age, 627,111. Consequently 967 children (including 
the blind, deaf, and dumb, children of strangers, and those whose par- 
ents could not provide proper clothing) in each 10,000 from 6 to 12 
years of age were not enrolled in public or private schools.

  The number of those attending repetition schools in 1893 increased 
principally in the public schools and in the nonsubsidized private 
institutions for boys, while a small decrease is noticed in the subsidized 
private schools and a somewhat larger decrease in the nonsubsidized 
private schools for girls. 
By adding the number of children of school age (6 to 12) for 1893, 
given in the table on page 489, to the number of children attending 
repetition schools (over 12 years of age) we obtain a total of 646,577 
children, and for 1889 a total of 618,633 children. 
The teachers employed in the foregoing schools numbered 16,953 in 
1893, and 15,192 in 1889. The average of pupils to each teacher was 43 
and 45, respectively. The number of pupils in attendance on May Lis 
taken as the average for the scholastic year. 
The employment at labor of children under 12 years of age was pro- 
hibited in 1889. School attendance is encouraged by means of prizes, 
school entertainments, and rewards, and distribution of savings-bank 
books, principally in 269 communes. A sum of about $15,968 was 
spent in this manner in 1893. 
The attendance at repetition schools is not compulsory, and instrue- 
tion is given gratuitously. The expenses are borne by the communes,

  492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The public infant schools are intended for poor children from 3 to 6 
years of age. Leyden has, for instance, three schools of this kind; in 
each of them there are from 300 to 400 children. Infant schools have 
been in operation ever since 1806, when a regulation of the law govern- 
ing public instruction enjoined upon the inspectors ‘‘to make endeavors 
for the establishment of a sufficient number of infant schools.” These 
institutions prospered, especially under the patronage of the Society of 
Public Good, which from the year 1823 founded a considerable number. 
The infant schools patronized by this society were neutral in regard to 
religion, The various denominational communes created on their part 
the “salles d’asiles,” having a sectarian basis. Other communes opened 
public infant schools. The law of 1878 on primary instruction did not 
include these institutions in the number of schools. They are, however, 
subject to the regulations of article 5 (relating to hygienic conditions 
and cleanliness of schoolhouses) and to article 72 (relating to the super- 
intendence exercised by the municipalities and inspectors). 
Teachers of infant schools are not required to hold a certificate of 
capacity, and the State has not done anything in behalf of their pro- 
fessional training. The Froebel method has been introduced into many 
of these schools. : 
Instruction was also extended to those detained in the various penal 
institutions, which include 3 reformatory schools, 31 penitentiaries, and 
45 houses of detention. Children under 16 years of age are placed if 
necessary in one of the three State reformatories.

The statistics show that in 1893-94 of 20,779 detained 1,538, or 7.4 
per cent, were well instructed; 14,880, or 71.6 per cent, were not 
admitted; 4,361, or 20.98 per cent, attended the lessons.

The school regulations require that— 
Primary schools shall be open without intermission the whole year, except holidays. 
During class hours the master shall be present from the opening of school to closing; 
he must not engage in anything not connected with teaching, nor absent himself 
except in cases of absolute necessity. The master must not permit pupils to leave 
the school unnecessarily, but require attention and good behavior both in the class 
room and on the playgrounds. Pupils must be enrolled, as far as possible, for fixed 
terms. Instruction in the different branches shall, as far as possible, be conveyed 
to the pupils by means of the blackboard. An examination shall be held once a 
year at each school. Qualified pupils shall then be promoted from the lower to the 
higher grades, and, if circumstances permit, rewards shall be given for diligence 
and merit. A deserving pupil, when leaving school after completion of the course 
of study, shall be presented with a certificate of honor. 
A code of regulations shall be drawn up for each school, and this, whether written 
or printed, shall be displayed on a board, hung up in the class room, and from time 
to time be read and explained by the master. 
Teachers.—Under the provisions of the law of 1857 there were two 
classes of assistant teachers, but under subsequent regulations there 
are only head masters and teachers. Pupil teachers are not included 
in the law. 
Only persons of good morals who possess the qualifications required 
by law are admitted as teachers. Foreign teachers must obtain a 
special permit from the King. These rules do not apply to those who 
teach children of private families exclusively nor to persons who vol- 
untarily offer their services and receive no remuneration therefor. 
Teachers are not allowed under the law to pursue any profession out- 
side of their school duties, nor are they permitted to hold any office or 
allow members of their family to engage in any professional pursuit 
at their residences. The King, however, can suspend this regulation 
in special cases. 
Besides the two classes of teachers mentioned, there are pupil teachers
-P-A-G-E-552
  494 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
or aspirants, i. e., young pupils who are otherwise qualified, but have 
not reached the requisite age, or those students in normal schools who 
are teaching in a primary school connected therewith. Persons 
teaching modern languages, drawing, gymnastics, etc., are considered 
“special teachers.” 
‘Women are largely employed as teachers, not only in coeducational 
schools but also in the classes of younger boys. It rarely happens, 
however, that women teachers are advanced to the highest classes. 
The positions in the higher grade girls’ schools are remunerative and 
much sought after, and daughters of rich and distinguished families, 
who are by no means obliged to earn a living or make teaching their 
profession, often fill such places. 
Appointments.—Head masters or mistresses of communal schools are 
appointed by the councils of the communes, who select their names 
from a list of candidates (not less than 6) who have passed the pre- 
scribed competitive examination. The head master and regular teach- 
ers are appointed by communal councils from lists of at least 3 candi- 
dates who have been proposed by the aldermen in concurrence with 
the local school superintendent. Competitive examinations are not 
required for these appointments. : 
The councils are empowered to discharge teachers from schools either 
by allowing them to resign, or by request of a district school inspector, or 
burgomaster and aldermen. In such cases the phrase “not honorably” 
may be added to the paper of dismissal. 
In order to obtain a position as teacher it is requisite that candidates 
shall present to the authorities in charge of appointments certificates 
of qualification and moral conduct furnished by the burgomaster of the 
commune in which the applicant lived during the last two years, or by 
the commissioner of the province. 
The only approach to the monitorial system in the schools of Holland 
is where young people of either sex, who have written authority from 
the school superintendent of the arrondissements, are admitted to 
schools as pupil teachers, under the following conditions: (a) They 
must be over 15 years of age and under 20; (b) they must work under 
the direct supervision of a competent teacher; and, (¢) having per- 
formed these duties for a period of three months, a pupil teacher must 
produce a certificate, signed by the head master of the school to which 
he or she belonged, stating that conduct and progress are satisfactory. 
The following corps of teachers was engaged in 1893 in 4,373 primary 
schools, and in 1889 in 4,215 schools:

  Examinations of primary teachers, both public and private, are 
ordered by the State on subjects from a to é, or a to k, in article 2 of 
thelaw. Certificates of efficiency are: (a) Those entitling to give home 
or school instruction in subjects of article 2, under a to ¢ or k; (b) 
those conferring the rank of head master, and entitling the person 
certified to give home or school instruction in subjects of article 2, 
under a toi or k, and subjects mentioned under 0, p, q; (¢) those 
entitling the teacher to give home and school instruction in enumerated 
subjects. 
Candidates who are 18 years of age may be admitted to these exam- 
inations, and must notify the local school superintendent in due time 
and submit certificates of age and moral character. Such candidates 
may be examined either in the province in which they reside or in 
which they desire to be appointed. The first examination in the year 
is held on April 1; the second in October. 
Of these candidates, 390 male and 455 female passed their final 
examinations at the end of the year 1893-94, and received certificates, 
besides 166 persons, 78 male and 88 female, in subject j, and 80 female 
in subject %. For 1889 there was a total of 1,137 candidates receiving 
teachers’ certificates. 
Salaries of teachers.—Each teacher receives a fixed annual salary, 
which in no instance shall be less than $281 for the head master of a 
school, and not less than $241 for those holding a diploma as head 
master, and not less than $161 for regular teachers. The head master 
of a school is entitled to free residence and a garden, if possible, or an 
allowance for house rent,
-P-A-G-E-554
  496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
In 1893 the salaries of head masters ranged from $281 to $1,085. Of 
these, 2,171 received from $281 to $441, and 830 ranged from $442 to 
$1,045. The highest salaries were paid to three head teachers, who 
received from $1,046 to $1,085. The salaries of regular teachers ranged 
from $161 to $643. 
Three thousand one hundred and one teachers were paid salaries from 
$161 to $241; 79 teachers were paid from $603 to $640, and the remain- 
der, numbering 5,838, each received from $242 to $602. 
The funds for salaries in 1893-94 were derived from the following

Pensions of teachers.—Under the provision of article 38 of the law all 
teachers who have reached the age of 65 years, and those who are 
mentally or physically disabled, after ten years’ service, are entitled to 
pensions. Head masters who are suspended by reason of schools hay- 
ing been discontinued receive half pay for a term of five years if within 
this period they do not obtain other employment the remuneration for 
which is equal to their previous salary as a teacher. These pensions 
are paid quarterly, and they amount to one-sixtieth of the annual sal- 
ary for each year of service, but must never exceed two-thirds of: the 
former salary. 
In 1893 pensions were granted to 27 teachers, male and female, and 
to 41 head masters; in 1889 to 13 teachers and to 45 head masters. 
These pensions ranged from $80 to $523 for each head master, and from 
$40 to $321 for regular teachers. The total sum expended for pensions 
of public primary-school teachers amounted in 1893 to $138,280 and 
in 1889 to $114,507. 
In conformity with article 41 of the law of August 17, 1878, all 
teachers contributed 2 per cent of their annual salaries to the pension 
fund, which amounted in 1893 to $75,943 and in 1889 to $68,103. The 
pension system relieves those teachers who have served faithfully as 
such from actual care and anxiety as to provision for old age. 
 
-P-A-G-E-555
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 497 | 
The moral training of the young is regulated by articles 22 and 33 of 
the law: 
School education shall conduce to the intellectual development of the young, who 
shall be trained in the Christian and social virtues by means of instruction in all 
appropriate and useful branches of knowledge. 
The lessons of religion are intrusted entirely to the minister and 
special teachers of theology. Regular teachers must refrain from 
teaching, doing, or permitting anything at variance with the respect 
due to the religious convictions of other sects. A teacher guilty of 
offense in this respect may be suspended for a term not exceeding one 
year, but in case of repetition of the offense he may be suspended for 
an indefinite period from the duties of a public-school teacher. The 
introduction of religious instruction into common schools is no depar- 
ture from the principles of thelaw. This feature has been adopted from 
practical considerations on account of the difficulties experienced by 
parents who can not obtain religious instruction for their children in 
other suitable places, but precautions are taken so that religious teach- 
ing shall not interfere with other lessons. The school simply is an 
agent between parents who desire their children to be initiated into 
religion and their respective religious teachers. 
Savings banks.—Endeayvor has been made by the school authorities 
to develop thrift in children by introducing the savings-bank system 
after the English model. In each class room there is kept a receptacle 
in shape of a flat wooden box, with numbered compartments arranged 
so as to receive temporarily the small earnings of the children. Once 
a week the contents are counted and deposited in a bank. 
School fees.—The local authorities were allowed, under the provisions 
of the law of 1857, to make primary instruction gratuitous in the com- 
munes under their jurisdiction. One hundred and forty-six thousand 
and sixty-two, or 36 per cent of 406,329 children enrolled in public ele- 
mentary schools, in 1857 received gratuitous instruction; and in 1876 
50 per cent, or, including all children under some public instruction, 58 
per cent. 
The estimate of December 31, 1889, showed that in 166 communes 
no fees were charged for children attending public primary schools. 
Such communes numbered in—

  In a report of the United States consul at Amsterdam in 1889 we 
find the following information : 
The public primary schools of this city are divided into four classes. 
The first class, of which there are 51 at this time, are free schools. 
In the second-class schools, of which there are also a goodly number, the school 
money charged is for 1 child 15 cents, Dutch currency, or 6 cents American money, 
per week; for 2 children of the same family, 124 cents éach, and for 3 children only 
 
-P-A-G-E-556
  
  A98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
10 cents each per week; in the third class the charge for 1 child is 20 florins, or about 
$8 per annum, and for 2 or more children of the same family 16 florins, or about $6.40, 
each; in the fourth class the charge for each child is 70 florins ($28) per annum, and 
for 2 children or more of same family 60 florins, or $24, each. 
'\ School buildings——The repairs and erection of school premises are 
regulated by articles 4, 5, and 50 of the law of August 17, 1878, and the 
building and furnishing of the same by the royal decrees of May 4, 
1883, and August 30, 1884, 
Schoolhouses in Holland are of diverse styles and have been con- 
structed as necessity demanded; but on the whole the Dutch have not 
displayed much taste in the architecture of public school buildings, 
says Mr. Ipsen in Vor Ungdom. The usual plan of country school- 
houses in the Province of Utrecht in 1844 consisted of rooms about 52 
by 26 feet, bisected by glass partitions, and were intended for about 150 
children. 
Some of these buildings much resemble the very old English school- 
houses; at The Hague, e. g., are seen square buildings without parti- 
tions, where the chief difference consists in the position of the seats 
for classes, and not in the room itself, the pupils being placed back 
to back instead of face to face. 
Another plan of a school building at Amsterdam for 500 children 
shows only one row of desks, and the great length of the room in pro- 
portion to its width is a serious defect. Both these styles, as far as 
new buildings are concerned, may be considered out of date. All new 
schoolhouses are excellent, and provided with modern improvements. 
A burgher school in Leyden, erected in 1890-91, will serve as an 
example. It has excellent ventilation, and the class rooms have 
high ceilings and good light. In order to procure the best light possi- 
ble windows have been cut in the partition walls of the class rooms at 
such a height as to prevent the pupils from seeing each other. The 
halls of this school are unusually broad and paved with small grooved 
tiles. 
Mr. Ipsen, in Vor Ungdom, says: 
In Dutch schools a Danish eye soon detects the absence of taste for embellishment 
and comfort which would be very inexpensive in many cases. Even in handsome 
new buildings there is a certain bare look, though everything is scrupulously neat 
and clean. 
Article 6 of the law of August 17, 1878, prescribes that the area of 
each schoolroom be at least 0.8 square meter for each pupil, with a 
space of at least 3.6 cubie meters per pupil; the height of the room 
being 4.5. The doors of the schoolroom must not be in direct contact 
with the air outside. The halls and vestibules are lighted sufficiently 
and must be at least 2 meters wide and not lower than 24 meters high. 
The outside walls of a school building shall have at least 0.23 meter 
thickness. 
On the establishing of a new school, the communal council must
-P-A-G-E-557
  EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 499 
observe the following regulations of article 13 of the royal decree of 
May 4, 1883, in regard to school furniture: 
Each school bench shall accommodate two children, and have a support for the 
lower part of the back. The tables shall be constructed with receptacles in which 
the girls may keep their needlework. 
The modern equipments of schools in Holland are very handsome, 
without any display of extravagance. The benches and tables are 
made to accommodate 4 children, 2 in front and 2 in the rear, the tables 
being provided with a space under the lid for school necessaries. There 
are appropriate benches in every room for scholars of different sizes, 
and children when entering a new class are first measured and then 
seated at the suitable tables. In infant and primary schools each class 
has its counting frame, and every slate is fitted with one of these useful 
devices. Great pains are taken to convey a correct idea of numbers 
and the principles of arithmetic by means of practical and intelligent 
methods. Blackboards are in general use. 
School hygiene.—Hygienic conditions of school buildings are regu- 
lated by articles 4,5, and 50 of the law, and the royal decree of August 
29, 1884. Buildings condemned by the supervising health inspectors 
must remain closed for school purposes until the necessary improve- 
ments have been made. Persons transgressing against the law will be 
fined from $10 to $20, and for repeated offenses from $20 to $40 and 
imprisoned for a period of not less than eight days or more than one 
year. Schoolrooms must always be kept clean and in good order; and 
to that end they must always be aired during the recesses. Teachers 
are required to see that pupils are at all times cleanly, and at the same 
time exercise the greatest care in regard to their health. To this end 
baths have been introduced into some of the schools. 
School libraries.—The arrondissement libraries increased from 94 in 
1889 to 101 in 1893. The volumes were increased, during the same 
period, from 30,558 to 36,132. The names of 5,461 readers were regis- 
tered for 1893. One thousand two hundred and eighty-eight teachers’ 
meetings were held during the year, in the above-mentioned arron- 
dissements, at which an average number of 3,525 public and 285 
private teachers were present.

The subsidies received by the communes from the General Govern- 
ment have been deducted from the communal expenditures and income, 
otherwise these sums would have been counted twice. 
The difference between expenditures for primary instruction and 
income from the same, 1878-1893, amounting to $73,864,873, was paid 
out of the General Government and communal treasuries. 
A new regulation came into operation in the Netherland Indies on 
November 1, 1894, for the primary schools of Europeans and that por- 
tion of the population that has been assimilated with the Europeans. 
For the Island of Java there has been established a publie school in 
every group that has not less than 20 European pupils, and for the 
neighboring islands 1 school in each community containing 15 European 
pupils. These schools are also accessible to the native children who 
are assimilated with Europeans, provided they have a sufficient knowl- 
edge of the Dutch language. These schools include the children of the
-P-A-G-E-560
  502 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
black soldiers who are of African descent and have embraced Chris- 
tianity. Such schools are partly coeducational, though there are special 
schools for girls. The scheme of instruction embraces reading, writing, 
arithmetic, the elements of the Dutch language, history of Holland 
and the Netherland Indies, geography, elements of natural sciences, 
singing, drawing, gymnastics, and in the special schools for girls, needle- 
work. The supervision of primary instruction is intrusted to a director, 
assisted by several inspectors and a local commission. For inspection 
the Netherland Indies are divided into three divisions, the first com- 
prising a part of Java (Bantam, Batavia, Cheribon, etc.), Sumatra, and 
West Borneo; the second, the rest of Java (Tegal, Pekalonga, Sama- 
rang, Japara, etc.) and South Borneo; the third, the Island of Celebes, 
the Moluccas, and the small islands. Beside these there are a number 
“of private schools that are entitled to a subsidy from the Government, 
THE NORMAL SCHOOLS (KWEEKSCHOLEN). 
Normal schools are provided for by article 39, section 1, of the regu- 
lations approved by the royal decree of May 28, 1879. 
In the official reports on education in Holland we find the normal 
schools and institutions for the training of teachers and head teach- 
ers, although properly classified under secondary instruction, included 
under the heading of primary instruction. 
A large number of normal institutions are maintained and provided 
for by the State, which are designated as training schools and city 
normal courses. 
The State grants a subsidy to all normal schools that are founded by 
the communes; they must, however, meet the requirements of the 
State institutions. A practice school (leerschool) is connected with 
each normal school, in which the students practice teaching. 
The directors and teachers of normal schools are appointed by the 
King, and such schools have a four-years course with four classes. In 
each class there are about 20 students. 
In normal schools for young men, which are day schools, students 
may live at the homes of private families in the vicinity, while normal 
institutes for young women are generally boarding schools, in all of 
which the scholastic year commences on the first Monday in September. 
Holidays of eight days at Easter and ten at Christmas are given, as 
well as a six-weeks vacation preceding the first Monday in September. 
Candidates desiring admission to a normal school must pass an exami- 
nation before the director and teachers in accordance with a programme 
arranged by them and approved by the minister of the interior. This 
programme is published every January in the Nederlandsch Staats- 
courant. Candidates obtaining the highest marks are admitted. They 
must have attended ordinary elementary schools and preparatory classes 
for normal courses before they can be admitted to the regular course 
of a normal institute. Teachers must require all students to attend

religious instruction, which is given at stated hours, and also their 
churches. Books and school material are furnished free of cost. 
The programme of every normal school includes: (1) Reading; (2) 
writing; (3) arithmetic; (4) composition; (5) the Dutch language; (6) 
general and natural history; (7) geography; (8) natural sciences; (9) 
singing; (10) violin and piano; (11) principles of the French, German, 
and English languages; (12) mathematics; (13) pencil drawing; (14) 
gymnastics; (15) agriculture; (16) theory of teaching and pedagogy. 
The minister of the interior can temporarily dispense with subjects 
11 to 15. 
I. STATE TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR TEACHERS (MEN). (RIJKSKWEEK- 
SCHOLEN VOOR ONDERWIJZERS.) 
, On September 1, 1893, there were 463 students enrolled in 6 train- 
ing schools maintained by the Government. Of 130 students in the 
higher class, 78 obtained diplomas at the final examinations held in 
1894. The practice schools which are connected with the training 
schools numbered 1,661 students. These practice schools are regular 
primary schools supported by the State (Government), and they employ 
about 58 teachers. Sixty-nine teachers were employed in the normal 
schools, besides 8 gymnastic teachers. 
The following table shows the distribution of students, pupils, and 
teachers in the above-mentioned schools, 1893-94:

persons made application for admission to the new normal school in 
Nijmegen for the course beginning in January, 1894. Sixty-five stu- 
dents attended the courses of gymnastics for teachers of gymnastics 
at Haarlem, Deventer, Groningen, and Maastricht. 
The programme of the State normal schools includes: (1) The Hol- 
landish language, reading, grammar, orthography, and literature; (2) 
writing; (3) natural and general history; (4) mathematical, physical, and 
economical geography and drawing of charts; (5) arithmetic; (6) com-

Il. NORMAL COURSES SUSTAINED BY THE STATE (RIJKSNORMAAL- 
LESSEN). 
At the close of 1893 there were 43 State normal courses in operation 
of Class A and 53 of Class B. These courses extend over four years 
and include four progressive classes. 
The programme of normal course B includes the Dutch language, 
reading and writing, national history, geography, arithmetic, geometry, 
natural history, singing, pedagogy, and useful handiwork for girls, 
besides manual training for boys. The programmeof normal course A 
includes the same subjects and in addition thereto general history, 
pencil drawing, mathematics, gymnastics, and one of the modern 
languages. 
Candidates who have successfully completed the course of primary 
instruction are admitted to the preparatory class up to 14-years of 
age; those over 14 can enter the normal course. 
A director is at the head of each of these institutions, which are con- 
nected with practice schools. The scholastic year commences April 1, 
and closes March 31, the holidays and vacations during the year not 
exceeding six weeks in all. The annual school programme is arranged 
each January at a meeting of the teachers and the director. 
Three thousand and twenty-seven students, 1,480 male and 1,547 
female, attended these courses in 1893-94, Several city normal courses 
had been suspended in 1889 on account of a decrease in attendance; 
2,698 students, 1,481 male and 1,217 female. 
Ill, TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR TEACHERS SUPPORTED BY COMMUNES 
= (GEMEENTELIJKE KWEEKSCHOLEN). 
There are three institutions of this kind: 
(1) The training school in Amsterdam is coeducational, and has two 
parallel divisions. Division 1 is for the training of those who aspire 
to the rank of a teacher; division 2 is for teachers aspiring to the rank 
of head teacher, or for persons who study special branches. All stu- 
dents of the highest grade (class 4) took part in the final examination. 
The course of division 1 embraces four years and is attended by pupils 
from 14 to 18 years of age, the first two years being devoted to theo- 
retical instruction; the last two to theoretical and practical training.
-P-A-G-E-563
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 505 
Practical training is acquired in the practice school of the normal 
school, or in public or private schools of Amsterdam, this conforming 
to regulations of article S of the law. Instruction and school material 
are provided free of cost. Male students who distinguish themselves 
can obtain a scholarship of $30 per annum. There were 25 students, 
12 men and 13 women, who passed successful examinations, besides 2 
women who were not admitted the year before. 
One hundred and fifty four students attended the school in the be- 
ginning of the year and 12 additional students entered during the run 
of the year. The number of teachers in the normal and practice school, 
inclusive, was about 25. In 1889 there were 133 students in attend- 
ance. These schools are under the jurisdiction of the school super- 
intendent and local commission of primary instruction. 
(2) The training school for teachers (coeducational) in Leyden.—At the 
end of the year 1893-94 this school numbered 28 head teachers, 8 
female head teachers, 54 male and 32 female teachers, 9 female teachers 
with certificates conforming to article 56a, 89 normal pupils, 31 aspirant 
normal pupils, and 20 other students who studied special branches. 
Students under 15 are not admitted, and aspirants for the lowest grade 
must have attained the age of 13 years. None can enter without a pre- 
liminary examination. The course is completed in six years. Peda- 
gogics and violin or piano instruction belong to the course of study. 
Twenty-two normal pupils were admitted to the final examination 
coming under article 56a of the law on primary instruction, and 18 
passed successfully; and 11 out of 13 passed at a later examination. 
Eleven teachers, 10 male and 1 female, obtained the diploma coming 
under article 56b of the law; 3 men and 1 woman in the French lan- 
guage; 1 woman in German; 4 women in English. There were about 
25 teachers employed. A practice school is connected with the training 
school. 
(3) Training school for femule teachers in Groningen.—This was 
founded by the Society of Public Good (1816), and has since 1882 been 
supported by the commune. The school opens May 1, and closes April 
30each year. The burgomaster and aldermen are the superintendents; 
a special commission of supervision is appointed by the local council, 
by whom are also appointed the directress and the other teachers. 
The annual fee amounts to $20 each. Students from other communes 
are accommodated by private families at a cost of $160 per annum for 
board and room. 
The course for 1893 opened on May 1 with 54 students and about 17 
teachers, including 7 teachers in the primary department of the insti- 
tution. Five of these students who attended the fourth class (highest) 
passed a successful examination at the end of the year and obtained 
teachers’ certificates. These three schools received from the Govern- 
ment a total of $15,692, or, respectively, $9,648, $2,122, $3,922.

Vv. COURSES FOR THE TRAINING OF HEAD TEACHERS. 
In 1893 there was a total of 26 institutions of this kind in 25 cities 
(2 in Leeuwarden). The enrollment was 671 male and 223 female 
students, or a total of 894; 175 students, 143 male and 32 female, 
obtained the diploma of head teacher. 
In 1889 there were only 22 of these institutions, with 786 students in 
attendance.

Three hundred and fifty-five thousand and fifty-five dollars of the 
total expenditure for 1893 and $361,467 for 1889 were provided for by 
the General Government, while $64,327 for 1893 and $71,024 for 1889 
were paid out of the communal treasury. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION (MIDDELBAAR ONDERWIUJS). 
There were in 1890 two inspectors of secondary instruction: Dr. 
W.B.J. van Eyk, The Hague (1886), for the provinces of North Brabant, 
Gelderland, Zealand, Utrecht, Overijssel, and Limburg; Dr. A. T. van 
Aken, The Hague (1883), for South Holland, North Holland, Friesland, 
Groningen, and Drenthe; F. B. Léhnis (1892) having charge of the 
agricultural schools. 
Secondary instruction is based upon the law of May 2, 1863, amended 
by the laws of June 28, 1876, and April 25, 1879. 
Until the enactment vat the law of 1857 the burgher schools, which 
corresponded to German “Realschulen,” had been classed as primary 
only. It was then found necessary to establish intermediate schools, 
which are a grade between primary and higher schools. The law of 
1863 classed the burgher schools, higher burgher schools, agricultural 
schools, polytechnical schools, and all industrial schools under second- 
ary instruction. 
Schools of secondary instruction are either public or private, the 
public being those established and maintained by communes, provinces, 
and the State, separately or conjointly, and all others are private. Pri-
-P-A-G-E-566
  508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
vate secondary or middle schools may, however, receive subsidies from 
communes, provinces, or the State. 
Secondary tuition given to children of not more than three families is 
considered home instruction. Secondary instruction is gratuitous, but 
the highest fee in communal schools is $5 per annum, and in higher 
burgher schools, supported by the State, it is $25 per annum. 
Officials having charge of secondary instruction.—The minister of the 
interior is the supreme authority, and invests the local commissions, 
who are elected by the local council, with the supervision of the various 
institutions. In 1893 there were 8 commissions, consisting of 97 mem- 
bers, in charge of examining such persons as desired to obtain a 
diploma of secondary teacher. Each commission has a president. 
The 3 inspectors of secondary instruction are nominated by the King; 
one of them having special superintendence of the State agricultural 
school. For the manual-labor training schools there are several ladies 
appointed on the board of commissioners. The directors of the higher 
burgher schools are in charge of the general supervision of everything 
pertaining to these schools. 
Teachers.—Only persons holding a diploma of recognized universi- 
ties and secondary training schools, and a certificate of good moral 
standing, as required by law, are allowed to impart secondary instruc- 
tion. From this rule are exempted (1) persons who instruct children 
of one family only; (2) those who do not make teaching their profes- 
sion, but have obtained a concession from the King to teach without 
remuneration. 
In the higher burgher schools only male teachers are employed. 
The head teacher has the title of director, and all teachers are nomi- 
nated by the King. The director regulates the programme in con- 
junction with the teachers. Directors and teachers must obtain a 
permit from the minister of the interior before accepting a position at 
any public or private institution, or for giving private lessons. For- 
eigners must apply to the King for concessions. 
Directors and teachers of higher burgher schools supported by the 
communes are appointed by a local council from a list of candidates 
recommended by local authorities. 
Pensions are regulated by articles 31 to 35 of the law. Teachers are 
considered as Government officials and are all entitled to a pension 
from the State, and in determining the amount of pension the length 
of time spent in the public service is taken into consideration. The 
directors and teachers contribute annually to the general pension fund, 
and the communes refund to the Government one-half of the sum spent 
in pensions. The regulations governing the pensions of primary teach- 
ers agree in the principal points with those governing the pensions of 
secondary instructors.

  EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 509 
I. BURGHER DAY AND EVENING SCHOOLS, AND INSTITUTIONS CLASSED 
WITH THEM ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 14 OF THE LAW. 
They are classified as follows: 
1. Burgher day and evening schools. 
2. Apprentice schools. 
3. Trade schools. 
4, Drawing and industrial schools. 
5, The Academy of Liberal Arts in Rotterdam. 
6. Private burgher day and evening schools. 
Most of these schools are evening schools. They were established 
principally for the purpose of training artisans, mechanics, and agri- 
culturists. In each community of 10,000 inhabitants or more at least 
one burgher day and evening school must be established by the com- 
munal authority. The King can suspend this regulation where the 
inhabitants of a community live so far apart that it would be incon- 
venient for the pupils to attend such a school, or if other provisions 
have been made to fulfill the requirements. School fees may be col- 
lected, but not to exceed $5 per annum. A total of 39 institutions of 
this kind are in operation in the larger cities: 
(a) Thirty-two of class 1 are evening schools; the school at Leeu- 
warden is the only day school of this kind. There is only one school 
of class 2. These schools together had a total of 3,593 pupils enrolled 
in December, 1893. 
Thirteen hundred and seventy-six candidates were examined for 
admission to the schools at the beginning of the course. Of these 
1,001 passed and 375 failed. At the final examination there were 285 
pupils examined, of whom 237 passed and 48 failed. 
Two hundred and ninety-two teachers were employed in the above 
schools. 
(b) There were 6 schools of classes 3 to 6 in operation: The trade 
school in The Hague, the Academy of Liberal Arts, the trade school 
in Rotterdam, and the drawing school in Delfshaven (Rotterdam), the 
private burgher evening school in Leyden, and the industrial school in 
Helder, with an attendance of 1,563 pupils; teachers, 127. 
Three hundred and thirty-two candidates were examined for admis- 
sion at the beginning of the course, of which number 104 failed to pass; 
228 were admitted. At the final examination 69 were successful and 
8 failed. 
One hundred and forty-seven teachers employed in schools of classes 
1 and 2, and 7 employed in the schools of classes 3 to 6, inclusive, 
taught in the higher burgher schools also. 
The total sum expended for teachers’ salaries was, in schools of classes 
1 and 2, $49,089; classes 3 to 6, inclusive, $30,116; total, 1893-94, 
$79,205: 1889-90, $70,429; increase in four years, $8,776.

The institution called “Colony Nederlandsch Mettray” was founded 
in 1851 by Willem Hendrik Suringer for needy and neglected children 
of the Protestant church. After having finished the regular course the 
pupils are trained in agricultural or industrial pursuits, etc. Only pupils 
from 10 to 14 years of age are admitted. Many entertain the erroneous 
idea that “Mettray” is a reformatory colony, but anyone who visits it 
can easily recognize its object. The income of the institution is derived 
from gifts, annual contributions, interests from legacies, rents from farms, 
remuneration for work performed in the workshops, etc., and from regis- 
tration fees. 
For a boy attending 1 of the 35 divisions a fee of 832 per annum 
must be paid; those attending all divisions pay $60 and an entrance 
fee of $4. The colony is superintended by 7 commissioners and 4 inspect- 
ors, each of the latter living in 1 of the 4 family dwellings. Besides 
these there are head masters, 1 in each workshop, and 7 teachers. 
The programme of the foregoing schools includes the following studies: 
Mathematics, first principles of theoretical and applied mechanics and a 
thorough knowledge of instruments, physics and chemistry, natural 
history, technical knowledge of agriculture, rudiments of geography 
and history, Hollandish, fundamental knowledge of political economy, 
pencil and rectilinear drawing, and gymnastics. The local council may 
add to this programme the principles of technology, modeling, and one 
of the modern languages. 
The directors of the burgher schools are appointed by the local 
council from the list of applicants approved by the mayor and magis- 
trates, after having been examined by the inspector. The number of 
teachers and their salaries are fixed by the local council, and must be 
approved by the States-General.
-P-A-G-E-569
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 511 
The teachers of industry are trained at the normal schools and State 
Academy of Liberal Arts in Amsterdam and at the Academy of Liberal 
Arts at The Hague. 
Directors and teachers of burgher schools, whose maintenance is 
imposed upon the communes, are pensioned by the Government. The 
community, however, refunds half of the sum to the State, which sum 
is added to the State budget. Other expenses for burgher schools must 
be met by the communes. 
Ill, HIGHER BURGHER SCHOOLS. 
These schools are principally for the training of overseers, superin- 
tendents, and the commercial classes. They are divided into two 
grades, one comprising a course of five years and the other a course of 
three years. 
By virtue of the law there shall be not less than 12 higher State 
burgher schools in operation in the country, and in at least 5 of these 
the course must be five years. Anybody wishing to be admitted to such 
a school must pass an examination before the director and teachers, 
and pupils can not be promoted to higher classes without a previous 
public examination, but they may be transferred from a higher burgher 
school to another and be placed in the grade to which they belong, pro- 
vided they have a certificate from the director of the school which they 
hitherto attended. “The courses commence on the first Monday in Sep- 
tember, three school vacations being given during the year, from the 
middle of July to the beginning of the course, at Christmas, and at 
Easter, each of the last two lasting ten days. 
There are in all 61 higher burgher schools in existence; 20 are main- 
tained by the Government, 28 by the communes receiving subsidies, 
12 are nonsubsidized communal schools, and 1 a Roman Catholic insti- 
tution. These were attended by 6,166 young men taking a full course 
and 243 students pursuing elective studies. Forty schools admitted 
young girls, and were attended by 282 taking a full course and 104 
pursuing elective studies. 
The young men were distributed in the different classes of schools 
as follows: One thousand three hundred and seventy-three regular, 
and 107, or 7.7 per cent, following elective courses, in the 20 higher 
State burgher schools. The other schools numbered 5,036 attendants, 
besides 136, or 2.7 per cent, taking elective studies. The courses of 
gymnastics were followed by only 4,989 of the total students. 
The final examinations of these institutions are regulated by articles 
55 and 57 of the law, May 2, 1863 (Stbl. No. 50), and March 10, 1883 
(Stbl. No. 31), and are conducted in the following manner: 
(1) The royal commission nominates a board of examiners before 
May 1 of each year, and the parish is informed of the place and time 
of examinations. 
(2) The law requires oral and written examinations. The latter
-P-A-G-E-570
  512 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
comprise 10 branches and the former 5 different groups of subjects: 
Mathematics and mechanics; physics; historical, commercial, and polit- 
ical sciences; modern languages and literature; Netherland-Indian 
languages and pencil and rectilinear drawing; in all, 17 branches. 
(3) The board of examiners is divided into subcommissions, one for 
each subject, and each subcommissioner determines on the oral exam- 
ination in the special subject to which he has been assigned, or the 
written examination. . 
(4) After the discussion and preparation of the various exercises 
the conclusions are sent to the inspectors, who make selections from the 
proposed questions, which are then priuted at Government expense 
with absolute secrecy, and the printed forms are sealed up in packages 
and forwarded to the respective direvtors. 
(5) Written examinations take place on the same day in all cities, 
and the results are forwarded to the president of the committee. 
(6) The oral examination may include all branches, but must embrace 
all those belonging to the written examinations. The commission deter- 
mines the length of time permitted each candidate for the different 
subjects, while the president regulates the time spent on the oral 
examination. 
(7) The answers to each of the 5 groups are rated by figures, from 
1 to 10. 
About 300 candidates present themselves each year for the final 
examinations. Making allowance for a moderate programme, five hours 
is allowed each candidate—two hours for mathematics aud physics, one 
for history and geography, and two for languages—or a total of fifteen 
hundred hours, or fifty days, for all examinations; but as some of the 
schools require two days, the real aggregate is seventy-two days. This 
calculation, of course, can only be considered approximate, since at 
many of these schools there are more than twelve candidates. The 
certificates are distributed gratuitously, but diplomas of final exami- 
nations at agricultural, technological, and engineering schools require a 
fee of $16. 
Examinations for teachers of secondary schools and for home instruct- 
ors are also held once a year, the modé of which is prescribed by the 
law. 
Of 2,348 pupils who presented themselves for admission to the lowest 
class, 1,692, or 72 per cent, passed the examination, and 656, or 27.94 
per cent, failed. 
Three hundred and fifty-five were examined for admission to a higher 
class, of which 179 passed, 72 entered a lower grade, and 104 failed. 
There were also 140 students who entered classes without previous 
examinations—68 in 10 State and 72 in 19 communal higher burgher 
schools. 
Eight hundred and eight teachers were employed at the higher 
burgher schools (this leaving 4 vacancies), 175 having a doctor’s degree,
-P-A-G-E-571
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. S13 
21 candidates (that is, young theologians who had recently graduated), 
488 teachers having diplomas of secondary instruction, 35 with pre- 
vious diplomas, 35 with certificates conforming to articles 82 and 89, 
6 to article 90, and 34 to article 83; 14 without certificates. Twenty- 
seven of these teachers were employed at more than one school, which 
reduces the number of teachers to 777. One hundred and forty-four 
teachers were employed at 11 higher State burgher schools with a five- 
years course, 81 at 9 higher State burgher schools with a three-years 
course, 565 at 40 higher burgher schools supported by the communes 
with three or five years courses. 
Higher burgher schools for boys have a laboratory with accommoda- 
tions for each student, who is supplied with all necessary appurtenances 
including a desk with drawers for materials. Here he learns the more 
important chemical combinations by practical experiments, instead of 
committing to memory only and learning merely the qualities of the 
principal elements. Schools of this kind are also furnished with exten- 
sive collections of specimens in natural history, besides special conven- 
iences for studying anatomy. 
The salaries of teachers of the higher State burgher schools ranged 
from $1,005 to $1,407 for directors, who in two instances are furnished 
with free residence, and from $402 to $1,000 and over for the remaining 
number of teachers. 
At the higher burgher schools supported by communes the sala- 
ries ranged from $964 to $2,200 for directors (free residence in five 
instances), though there were three cases where directors received less 
than $964. They ranged from $402 to $1,000 and above for the reg- 
ular teachers. The expenditures for salaries for higher State burgher 
schools amounted to about $158,237 and for the communal higher 
burgher schools to about $400,628, or a total of $558,865; in 1889, 
$506,756. 
Programmes of higher burgher schools—The five-years course includes 
mathematics; principles of theoretical and applied mechanics; knowl- 
edge of instruments and technology; physics and its principal applica- 
tions; fundamental knowledge of mineralogy, geology, botany, and 
zoology; rudiments of cosmography; origin of communal, provincial, 
and State constitutions of Holland; political economy and statistics, 
especially of the Netherlands and its colonies; geography; history; Hol- 
landish, French, English, and German literature; Latin and Malayan 
languages; elementary knowledge of commerce, especially of merchan- 
dise and bookkeeping; penmanship; pencil and rectilinear drawing, 
and gymnastics. The three-years course includes mathematics; first 
principles of physics and chemistry; principles of botany, zoology, 
and mineralogy; bookkeeping; geography; history; Hollandish, French, 
and English languages; penmanship; pencil and rectilinear drawing, 
and gymnastics. 
The programmes for secondary schools for girls differ in some

respects, but they include bookkeeping, mathematics, and chemistry, 
besides literature. In the secondary schools for both sexes much 
importance is attached to modern languages and literature. Reading 
of classical authors as well as the literature of foreign countries is 
largely encouraged, and conversation in foreign languages during rec- 
reation hours is enforced upon young girls who attend these schools. 
The branches of natural sciences are assiduously cultivated. 
IV. SECONDARY (OR MIDDLE) SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS. 
These institutions are supported solely by the communes or private 
parties. There were in all 12 in operation in 1893, one of which was 
private. The school fees for a complete course are $20 to $40 per annum; 
for elective studies from $4 to $24 per annum for each subject. These 
courses cover three or five years, and each school has 5 classes. In 40 
schools girls have been admitted to the classes of the higher schools for 
young men. In every instance the young men show the greatest defer- 
ence for their girl fellow-students. Nothing detrimental to the cause 
of coeducation has been noticed in these schools. 
The following table shows the places where these schools are located, 
and the number of pupils:

Gymnastics are taught in all these institutions except in the pub- 
lic secondary schools in Amsterdam and Dortrecht; 939 pupils of 
those taking a complete course attended the courses of gymnastics. 
Examinations—Three hundred and fifteen young girls made applica- 
tion for admission to the lowest class in these schools; 273, or 86.5 per 
cent, passed a satisfactory examination, and 42, or 13.5 per cent, failed. 
This result was less favorable than in the preceding year, 91 per cent 
being admitted. Of 36 examined for a higher grade, 26 were promoted, 
2 entered a lower grade, and 8 failed. At the transition examination 
from the courses of 1892 to 1893, 889 pupils were successful and 166 
could not be promoted.
-P-A-G-E-573
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 515 
One hundred and twenty-five female teachers were employed in these 
schools, 113 of whom held diplomas of secondary instruction, 4 diplo- 
mas as head teachers, and 8 had no certificates. ‘There were, moreover, 
27 male teachers, 20 of these having doctors’ diplomas or the title of 
“candidate,” 14 with diplomas of secondary instruction, 2 had no cer- 
tificates, and 1 a certificate conforming to article 82. The teachers 
without diplomas were employed for singing and needlework. 
The annual remuneration of the directresses ranged from $964 to 
$1,286, and in Rotterdam, Dortrecht, Utrecht, and Deventer they are 
entitled to free residence. The salaries of the teachers, male and 
female, ranged from $420 to $630 per annum, and the total spent in 
salaries for directresses was $12,422, and for teachers $71,176. In 1889 
these sums amounted to $12,381 and $66,179. 
vy. AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS, 
The State agricultural school at Wageningen is the largest and best 
known, and has a higher burgher school connected with it. The attend- 
ance in 1893 was as follows: 66+1 students in the higher burgher 
school division; 62+1 students in Division A of agricultural school, 
41-++1 students in Division B, and 22 students in Division C. 
This gives a total of 191 regular attendants, and 3 hearers—that is, 
persons who come to listen to the lectures without paying fees. The 
two latter divisions have been established especially for higher scien- 
tific training in agriculture; each division has several classes. The 
students ranged from 12 to 18 years of age and above. An experiment 
station is also connected with the State agricultural school, at which 
numerous agricultural researches were made by the students. The 
examinations were very satisfactory. Fifty-two students in the higher 
burgher school division were promoted to higher classes at the begin- 
ning of the course of 1893; 42 out of 47 in Division A, and 21 out of 26 
in Division B, and 12 out of 16 in the highest class obtained diplomas. 
Six in Division C were promoted to the highest class and 6 others 
were granted diplomas. About 29 teachers were employed. Enroll- 
ment in 1889, 123 students and 4 hearers. 
In the Gerard Adriaan van Swieten Landbouwschool, at Willemsoord, 
opened in October, 1890, the number of students must not exceed 20, 
They are to be trained for two years theoretically, and also practically 
on the farms of the Society for Public Good. 
Only 7 pupils attended in 1893, under 4 teachers. 
There are, moreover, 2 horticultural schools, the “Tuinbouwschool,” 
of Amsterdam, and the “Gerard Adriaan van Swieten Tuinbouw- 
school,” of Fredericksoord, opened in 1884, with an attendance of 27 
and 40 pupils. Thirteen teachers were employed. The age for admis- 
sion 1s 15 years, and school fees are $24, $34, or $40 per annum. The 
total of students in 1889 was 45. 
In the School of Forestry, “Gerard Adriaan van Swieten Bosch-
-P-A-G-E-574
  516 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
bouwschool,” opened in 1888, 7 pupils followed the course in 1893, under 
4 teachers. Boys supported by the Society of Public Good receive not 
only gratuitous instruction in the school of Fredericksoord, but also 
free board. This school receives a state subsidy of $250; 10 students 
and 4 teachers in 1889. 
Besides the above-mentioned agricultural and horticultural schools, 
there are other similar institutions in the country, and winter courses 
have been established in various cities, to which the Government extends 
subsidies. In the official report of Holland for 1893-94 we find 36 sums 
itemized, representing State subsidies for as many winter courses and. 
agricultural schools. 
Establishments with courses in dairy farming are maintained by 4 
private associations in Oudshoorn, Bolsward, Friesland, and Geldern, 
and the Government in 1889 granted subsidies of $1,206, $1,608, $402, 
and $482, respectively, for their maintenance. These courses were 
attended by about 293 pupils, and 12 teachers were employed. There 
is no record for 1893. 
The accompanying programme will suffice to show the relative value 
placed in the agricultural schools on the several branches of study pur- 
sued: Political economy, practical mathematics (surveying, leveling, 
mensuration, etc.), mechanical science as applied to agriculture and the 
use of agricultural machines; the construction and arrangement of farm 
buildings; rectilinear drawing as applied to agricultural science and 
machinery; natural philosophy; chemistry and meteorology in their 
application to agriculture, general and special botany, and zoology; the 
anatomy and physiology of plants and animals; the distinguishing 
characteristics of the different domestic animals, their diseases and 
medical treatment; general and special agriculture; vegetable and fruit 
gardening, and the cultivation of timber and fruit trees, ete. 
VI. THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL IN DELFT. 
This institution is intended for the training of (a) those following 
industrial pursuits, and for technologists requiring a higher grade of 
technical and theoretical knowledge than they could acquire in the 
higher burgher schools comprising a five years’ course; ()) civil engi- 
neers, architects, and architectural engineers. 
Every student of the polytechnic school pays $80 in advance for the 
annual course, which entitles him to all the advantages of the school. 
Those taking elective studies pay only for the subjects chosen, at the 
rate of $4 per annum for each study, with one recitation per week. For 
four or more recitations per week the fee is $16 per annum for each 
study. No entrance fees are required, and the names of students are 
recorded at the beginning of each school year. The course commences 
on the first Monday in September. 
Head masters and teachers are appointed by the King, and the super- 
vision of the polytechnic school is in the hands of a director, who is 
likewise nominated by the King. He is assisted in his duties by a
-P-A-G-E-575
  
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. 517 
council consisting of the head masters of the school of which he is the 
president and from which the secretary is elected. The director, 
assisted by the council, arranges the course for the following year in 
May, and such programme as may be then prepared must be submitted 
to the minister of the interior for his approval. The director also has 
the general supervision over the museum and professional training 
departments presided over by the head master or teacher in charge of 
the various branches of instruction in the polytechnic school of the 
Kingdom. 
Most of the students who have taken the course of the polytechnic 
school in Delft and wish to go to the East Indies as Government officials 
prepare themselves for such positions by taking a two or three years 
course in the school at Leyden for the training of officials in the East 
Indian service, where they are taught the Java, Malay, and Boegine 
languages, etc. The East Indian languages, while they are taught at 
Delft, do not receive that special attention that is given at Leyden, for 
the reason that a great proportion of the students at Delft take a sec- 
ond course of study at Leyden. The school in Leyden is not only open 
to officers in the civil service, but is free to all doctors, missionaries, 
etc., who are destined for service in the Hast Indies. To all others the 
tuition fee is $75, paid in advance. No entrance fees are required. 
The programme of the polytechnic school includes the higher algebra, 
spherical trigonometry, and analytical geometry; descriptive geometry 
and its applications, differential and integral calculus, surveying, level- 
ing, and surface measurements, theoretical mechanics, applied mechan- 
ics, machinery, mechanical technology, applications of natural science, 
applied, practical, and analytical chemistry, chemical technology, 
modern manufactures, mineralogy and geology, applied geology and 
the working of mines, metallurgy, hydraulics, road, railroad, and bridge 
building, civil architecture, shipbuilding, rectilinear drawing, instruc- 
tion in the use of tools, instruments, and the turning lathe; construc- 
tion of models, political economy, commercial law, laws relating to 
engineering, public works, mining, and all industrial works. 
Two hundred and forty-one students attended a complete course of 
engineering and technology, while 84 students pursued elective studies. 
There were consequently 325 students in attendance, besides two ladies 
attending lectures. The first-named students were all graduates from 
a higher burgher school, having a five years’ course. Age of students 
from 19 to 23 years. ° 
The results of final examinations were as follows: Of 142 candidates 
applying for examination, 17 withdrew, 101 obtained diplomas, and 24 
failed. These examinations are regulated by articles 61 to 65 of the 
law. 
Opportunities are offered the students to make practical experiments 
with surveying and measuring instruments. The teaching corps con- 
sists of about 34 persons; 1 director, 14 professors, 9 teachers, 8 assist-

ants, and 2 teachers in modeling. Five amanuenses and 1 librarian are 
attached to the teaching staff. 
One hundred and seventy-one new works were added to the library, 
besides various journals, and 2,100 books were loaned out during the 
year. 
Numerous new objects were presented, or purchased for the depart- 
ment of decorative architecture, the laboratories, the department of 
natural sciences, and others.

VIII. SCHOOLS FOR DEAF-MUTES AND BLIND. 
The Institution of Rotterdam numbered 145 pupils, of which 119 
received gratuitous instruction; 70 were partly cared for by the insti- 
tution, and only 7 pupils paid fees, ranging from $5 to $60; 17 teachers 
were employed, not including the director and adjunct director; 163 
pupils in 1889. 
In the.JInstitution of Groningen there were 179 pupils, most of whom 
were entirely cared for by the institution and only a few paid tuition 
fees. The teachers numbered about 30; 173 pupils in 1889. 
The “St. Michiel’s Gestel” enrolled 143 pupils, 83 boys and 67 girls. 
Most of these were entirely cared for by the institution. There were 8 
teachers. The girls are taught by the Sisters of Charity; 156 pupils in 
1889. 
The Institute for the Blind at Amsterdam enrolled 58 children, 39

boys and 19 girls. Teachers employed, about17 in number, were under 
a director; 61 pupils in 1889. 
A. total number of 526 pupils were enrolled in the above-mentioned 
institutions; teachers employed, 76, including the directors. In 1889 
they numbered 558 pupils and 85 teachers. 
Ix. STATE NORMAL SCHOOL FOR THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS AND 
INSTRUCTORS IN DRAWING AND MODELING. 
Twenty-four ladies and 27 gentlemen attended the course in pencil 
drawing in Division A, and 6 gentlemen the course in architectural and 
mechanical drawing in Division B. There were besides 7 visiting stu- 
dents (hospitants). The entire course embraces three years. Eleven 
of the students obtained diplomas at the final examination. The school 
employed 11 teachers. The practice school numbered 58 students, 6 
girls and 52 boys. The total expenditure was $8,369, or $5,776 for 
teachers’ salaries and $2,593 for material. The income from tuition 
fees was $951, this leaving an excess of expenditure over income o¢ 
$7,418, which was paid out of the Government treasury. Seventy-one 
students in 1889, besides 38 in practice school. 
X. INSTRUCTION IN THE LANGUAGES, ETHNOLOGY, AND COUNTRIES 
OF THE NETHERLAND INDIES IN THE INSTITUTION OF DELFT. 
One hundred and forty-three students were attending this school. All 
of these were graduates from higher burgher schools with a five-years 
course, or from gymnasia with a six-years course. One was a grad- 
uate from the agricultural school in Wageningen and one an officer on 
furlough from the East Indies. Twenty-one out of 46 candidates who 
passed the entrance examination of the school were rejected because 
their physique did not answer the requirements of the service in the 
Netherland Indies. In 1889 there were 73 students and 16 teachers. 
The programme of the course is regulated by the burgomaster and 
the aldermen. It includes:

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION (HOOGER ONDERWIUJS). 
The present system of higher instruction is based upon the law of 
April 28, 1876, amended and modified by laws of May 7, 1878; June 
28, 1881; June 15, 1883, and July 23, 1885. 
Institutions of higher instruction are divided into public and private. 
Public, are those established and maintained by communes and the
-P-A-G-E-586
  528 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
State, separately and conjointly. All other institutions are called pri- 
vate, or “bijzondere,” schools. Under article 192 of the fundamental 
law, any person may teach the higher branches, subject to supervision 
by the proper authority. 
Foreigners must obtain a permit from the King before they can be 
employed as teachers of the higher branches, in either public or private 
institutions. 
Public higher instruction is provided for and taught in three State 
universities—in the gymnasia and progymnasia, and in the Communal 
University of Amsterdam. 
The “gymnasia” and Latin schools correspond to the German gym- 
nasium, while the courses given at the denominational “seminaria” 
and other superior institutions of this kind answer to the universities; 
but only the latter can confer academic degrees. 
STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
By the royal decree of February 17, 1890, the corps of officials at 
these universities was made to conform to the decrees of February 8, 
1889, and February 16, 1889. 
State University of Leyden (with 5 faculties).—The college of curators 
consists of 5 members. 
The senate is composed of 7 members, all being professors, namely, 
1 rector, 1 secretary and 4 assesors, 1 archivist. Each faculty has 1 
chairman and 1 secretary; in all, 10 members, with the title of professor. 
This university had 47 professors. In the faculty of theology, 5; of 
law, 8; of medicine, 9; of mathematics and natural sciences, i1; of 
letters and philosophy, 14. There were also 3 lecturers and 9 private 
tutors, or a total force of 59 teachers. 
State University of Utrecht (with 5 faculties).—The college of curators 
consists of 6 members. The senate is composed of 6 members, viz: One 
rector, 1 secretary and 3 assessors, 1 archivist. 
Each faculty has 1 chairman and 1 secretary, all having the title of 
professor. 
The corps of teachers comprises 37 professors. In the faculty of 
theology, 4; of law, 6; of medicine, 10; of mathematics and natural 
sciences, 10; of letters and philosophy, 7. To this number must be 
added 4 lecturers and 9 private tutors (docents), which gives a general 
total of 50. 
State University of Groningen.—The college of curators consists of 6 
members. The senate is composed of 7 members; 1 rector, 1 secretary, 
and 5 assessors. 
Each faculty has 1 chairman and 1 secretary, all having the title of 
professor. 
The University of Groningen embraces the faculties of theology, 
law, medicine, mathematical and natural sciences, and of letters and 
philosophy.
-P-A-G-E-587
EDUCATION IN THE NETHERLANDS. §29 
The corps of professors comprises 35 members. For the faculty of 
theology, 4; of law, 4; of medicine, 8; of mathematics and natural sci- 
ences, 9; and of letters and philosophy, 10. There were also lecturers 
and assistants, making a general total of 40. 
On reaching the age of 70, the professors in the universities are pen- 
sioned. The amount of their pension is determined by the number of 
years they have taught, but can never exceed the sum of $1,206 per 
annum. ‘The professors in the Catholic institutions are also pensioned . 
by the Government, and their pensions equal the salary of a Catholic 
priest. 
If the professors fail to perform their duties in a satisfactory man- 
ner, the minister of the interior may suspend them for a period of five 
weeks. Serious misdemeanor might be punished by removal from 
office. 
The curators, through the secretaries of the faculties, make detailed 
reports to the minister of the interior on all subjects connected with 
the universities. They do not receive a permanent salary for the per- 
formance of their duties, but are allowed by the Government $3 per 
day when they are actually engaged in the performance of their duty 
(30 cents per hour when traveling and expenses incurred for board 
and lodging). 
The curators report, on November 1 of each year, to the minister o 
the interior, making an estimate of the expenses for the coming year; 
and in accordance with this statement the minister requests the sum 
needed, which is paid out of the State treasury from moneys derived 
from the general revenue taxes of the country.

The Government grants six beneficiary scholarships in each of the 
universities to young men who have distinguished themselves in their 
former studies, the university receiving from the State $320 for each 
student in annual installments for the complete course. These moneys 
are derived from ecclesiastical funds that are realized from ancient 
estates which formerly—before the Reformation in 1517—were used for 
the installation of a Pope or bishop, but since the Reformation the Soy- 
ereign or Government has taken possession of these funds, which are

now disbursed by nonofticials or by committees under the direct super- 
vision of the State. 
Students who receive financial assistance from the Government are 
at liberty to select any of the courses of study allowed in the university.

University of Amsterdam, supported by the communes. By article 36, 
relating to superior instruction, the community of Amsterdam obtained 
a concession elevating the “Atheneum Ilustre” to a university. This 
was done October 15, 1887, and it has now the same privileges as the 
State universities. 
The college of curators consists of 2 members. 
Oorps of professors.—The senate consists of 1 rector-magnificus, 1 
secretary, and 4 assessors. The professors of the faculties are distrib- 
uted as follows: Of law, 7; of medicine, 14; of mathematics and nat- 
ural sciences, 11; of letters and philosophy, 11; of theology, 6; public

From the Revue Internationale de Enseignement, January, 1893, we 
learn that the medical studies in the universities of Holland will soon 
undergo a reform which the Government has had in contemplation for 
some time. Up to this date there have been four ways open to students 
desirous of qualifying for the medical profession, though there is but 
one course by which they can attain the degree of doctor of medicine. 
All such as desire this honor must first graduate from a gymnasium, 
and must have taken the university course; all others passing State 
examinations only can obtain a diploma in medicine, but can not assume 
the title of doctor. Before passing the State examinations, however, 
students are required to be in possession of a diploma of efficiency 
from a middle school (hoogere burgherschool) with a five years course; 
a diploma of promotion to the fifth year of a gymnasium, or a diploma 
proving they have passed a satisfactory examination in literature and 
mathematics. 
From January 1, 1894, the two latter courses will be closed. Thus, 
after December, 1893, these examinations in medicine can not be taken 
unless the candidate has a diploma either from a gymnasium or from a
-P-A-G-E-594
    
536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
middle school certifying a five years course, but the conditions neces- 
sary for the degree of M. D. will remain as at present. 
The same law regulates the qualification of foreign students in medi- 
cine. They will hereafter be admitted to the practice of medicine in 
the Netherlands and its colonies after having proved the validity of 
their foreign diplomas by an examination passed in the Dutch lan- 
guage. This is required in order to ascertain whether they know 
Hollandish well enough to understand their patients. j 
Gymnasia.—One of these institutions is in operation in each of the 
29 (30 in 1889) principal cities, and of these 25 received subsidies from 
the State. Gymnastics and Hebrew are not obligatory, and special fees 
from $12 to $40 are charged for these branches. These schools prepare 
for the universities. 
Total teachers, 431; 216 doctors, 49 candidates, 143 having teachers’ 
diplomas of secondary instruction, 10 teachers with a diploma of supe- 
rior instruction, in conformity with the clause of the law, and 13 
teachers having a diploma of secondary instruction, in conformity with 
the clause of the law. There were 427 teachers employed in 1889. 
The salary of a rector ranged from $1,045 to $2,010. The lowest 
salary paid to a rector of a “gymnasia” was $1,045, but the incumbent 
had free residence. These teachers, however, draw an additional salary 
from burgher day or evening schools, higher burgher sclools, middle 
schools for girls, or institutions for the training of teachers, wherever 
they may be employed. These additional salaries range from $200 to 
$400. Income from private institutions have not been taken into 
consideration.

There were, according to the foregoing figures, 6 students more and 
16 hearers less in attendance in January, 1894, than in January, 1890. 
Heaminations.—Six hundred and forty-six candidates were examined 
for admission; of this number, 490 were admitted to the lowest class; 
150 to higher classes, and 40 failed. At the final examination, at the 
close of the year, 1,733 students were transferred, 368 remained in the 
same class, and 6 withdrew.

New gymnasia’ buildings have been erected at Arnheim, Delft, Gonda, 
and Leeuwarden since 1889. The general conditions and accessories 
for instruction of all gymnasia are very satisfactory and constantly 
improving. 
Private superior instruction.—(a) The Free University of Amsterdam 
has a director, the incumbent being in 1893 C. M. E. van Lében Sels. 
(b) The college of curators is composed of 2 members; 1 rector and 7 
professors are employed as teachers. (c) The total number of students 
during the year amounted to 85, registered as follows: Fifty-seven in 
the faculty of theology; 3 in the faculty of theology and law; 3 in the 
faculty of theology and letters; 12 in the faculty of law; and 10 in the 
faculty of letters. Eighty students in 1889. 
The library received various new works. 
The following examinations were passed: Five with a degree of can- 
didate of divinity; 2 with a degree of candidate in the faculty of letters ; 
1 first examination for doctor’s degree; 11 propedeutic examinations 
in theology, and 1 in law.

  538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Besides the Free University of Amsterdam, there are about 26 
denominational private institutions for superior instruction in other 
parts of Holland, some of which receive subsidies from the State. 
They are designated as follows: (1) Seminaries, (2) colleges, (3) Latin 
schools, (4) training schools. 
The aim of most of these institutions is the training of young men 
for ministers in their respective churches, and for teachers of higher 
branches. 
In 1893 there were 3,774 students enrolled in 26 of these denomina- 
tional institutions. The number of teachers can not be ascertained 
with accuracy, but was about 317. Total students in 1889, 1,996. This 
shows an increase in four years of 1,778 students.

These sums were paid out of the respective treasuries of the General 
Government, provinces, and communes. 
There are no special school taxes raised in the Netherlands, and all 
funds for education in that country are taken from the general taxes 
imposed by the Government and provinces, or from the local taxes of 
the communes. 
Communes that are unable to support the necessary number of schools 
send in a petition to the “‘Gedeputeerde Staten” (legislative body of 
the Kingdom), who refer it to the minister of the interior, and in case 
of his approbation a subsidy or loan may be granted out of the general 
treasury of the Government. The principal proportion of expenses for 
the communal schools is paid by the city treasurers from local taxes.

Area, population, and administrative divisions.—Area, 110,623 squaro miles; popula- 
tion, 30,724,897 (estimated December 31, 1893) ; capital, Rome; population, 451,000 in 
1893; minister of public instruction, Commendatore Guido Baccelli. The administra- 
tive divisions consist of 69 provinces, of which 60 are divided into territories and (the 
province of Mantua and the 8 provinces of Venetia) into districts. The territories 
(circondari) number 197, and there are 87 districts (distretti). These again are 
divided into communes (comuni), numbering 8,259 in 1881 and 8,258 in October, 1894. 
Educational summary.—With a population of 30,724,897 in 1893 there were 11 per 
cent of pupils in schools below the universities. Of the total (3,106,852) about 96 
per cent were in elementary schools and 3 per cent in secondary schools. In higher 
institutions the percentage was 0.6; in special schools, 1.1 per cent. Per capita of 
enrollment in elementary schools, $4.09; per capita of population, 39 cents. 
The administrative and educational authorities are brought closely together in 
their duties, as is shown in the statements appended. The State, province, or com- 
mune maintains public instruction; a member of the cabinet is in charge of educa- 
tion; the King himself appoints certain grades of instructors; the parliamentary 
bodies discuss and decide upon educational questions; the prefect of the province 
is president of the provincial school council; the syndic looks after the registration 
of pupils of school age, notifies parents of neglect of duty, ete. 
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY.? 
By Dr. Eatsto Rossi,’ Rome, Italy. 
Public instruction in Italy is regulated by law of November 13, 1859. 
This law has been modified, however, by royal decrees and by later 
laws.   
1Prepared for the International Congress of Education of the World’s Columbian 
Exposition, Chicago, July 25-28, 1893, and printed in part in the “Addresses and 
Proceedings of the International Congress of Education,” pp. 907-911.

  544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The educational system! comprises three grades—elementary, second- 
ary (including classical and technical schools), and superior. There are 
also infant schools which aim to give the rudiments of an education to 
children between 3 and 6 years of age, the latter being the earliest 
age at which children are admitted to the primary grades. 
Private individuals of known character and capability are permitted 
to open infant schools and those of elementary and secondary grades, 
providing the localities in which the schools are to be opened are satis- 
factory from a hygienic point of view to the authorities. 
INFANT SCHOOLS. 
The compulsory education laws do not apply to the infant schools. 
These are founded by the communes, by corporations, associations, and 
private individuals. Many of them are autonomous in character, pos- 
sessing their own revenues, which accrue from perpetual funds and 
donations. Other schools are supported entirely by the individuals or 
corporations founding them. 
Almost all these schools receive subsidies from the commune, prov- 
inces, and the State, in addition to the funds received from the sources 
mentioned above. The children receive gratuitous instruction in the 
majority of infant schools; in a few a small fee is charged, the means 
of tlfe family being taken into consideration in making such charges. 
In 1889 the communes gave $317,532 to the infant schools, the State 
$8,685. 
The number of infant schools and of children attending them is 
enumerated in the following table:

ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The elementary schools are in charge of the communes and are 
under the supervision of their administrative officers. In conformity 
with the law they are gratuitous and are maintained by subsidies from 
provincial and communal funds. In accordance with special laws, the 
State aids in such support by subsidies for construction and repairs 
and for teachers’ salaries. The State is authorized to favor communes 
which are too impoverished to construct school buildings by granting 
subsidies for such buildings, or by extending other aid, either by loan 
or gift, if there is any special reason for so doing. If any loans have 
been made the State undertakes to reimburse the institution loaning 
said fund, adding thereto a nominal interest. 
The elementary schools are frequented by children from 6 to 12 years 
of age. These schools are divided into two grades; the lower grade, 
which extends through three years, is subdivided into two classes, 
equivalent to a two-years course. The course of study includes writing, 
elementary arithmetic and the metric system, history of Italy, ele- 
ments of geography, natural history and physics, civic education, and 
gymnastics. 
All the communes are required to establish lower grade elementary 
schools; communes of 4,000 inhabitants and over are required to estab- 
lish those of the higher grade. In these larger communes there must 
also be institutions of a secondary grade. 
By law of July 15, 1877, which carried out the provisions of the law 
of 1859, parents were obliged to send their children between 6 and 9 
years of age to the elementary grades, unless they ‘could show cause for 
instruction at home or in private schools. This compulsory act could 
be carried on beyond the ninth year if the pupil, when called up for 
examination at close of the course, did not indicate satisfactory knowl- 
edge of the studies in the lower grade elementary schools. 
By decree of February 16, 1888, pupils of both public and private 
schools, and those who obtain home instruction, must receive certificates 
of having passed such final examinations before they can be placed on 
the registration list for the holding of political or administrative office. 
Parents and guardians who fail to conform to the above regulations are 
subject to censure from the syndic, and, in case of further noncompli- 
ance, they are subject to a fine of not less than $2.50. 
By law of July 15, 1877, which went into force in October, 1877, each 
commune is required to have a certain number of teachers trained for 
duty in these lower grade elementary schools. This number is to be 
proportionate to the population.

ain 1692-03 (vide Annuario Statistico Ttaliano, 1895) there were 2,487,803 pupils in public and pri- vate schools of an elementary grade (boys, 1,311,018; girls, 1,176,785); class rooms, 58,277; teachers, 60,380.   
  The ratio of schools, teachers, and pupils to population is based in 
the years 1861-62 to 1865-66 upon the census of December 31, 1861; 
that of 1870-71 to 1875-76, upon the census of December 31, 1871, and 
that of 1880-81, upon the census of December 31, 1881. The reports 
presented for the other years mentioned in the table are based upon 
an estimate of population made annually in the month of December 
following the opening of the schools. The estimate of population is 
formulated upon the basis of December, 1881, adding to it the births 
in each year and subtracting the deaths. No attention being paid to 
the movement of population, i. e., the immigration and emigration, 
such a determination is liable to error, and such errors increase in pro- 
portion to the time that has elapsed from the date of the original 
census. The movement from one commune to another exercises but 
little influence upon the territorial department to which it belongs, and 
less upon the total for the Kingdom. On the other hand, the emigration. 
to foreign shores must not be overlooked in so far as it appertains to 
the whole Kingdom. It is fairly easy to take note of the emigration, but 
the means approximating the immigration and the return of Italians to 
their native country is less easy. The estimates relative to the move- 
ment of population, as, for example, the estimates of mortality, by 
province and by territory (circondari), and also in the largest cities, 
taken one by one, necessitate that calculations appertaining to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-605
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 547 
population of these subdivisions be made at least approximately, and 
yet the population is calculated on the supposition that the increase 
from year to year is in the same proportion as the augmentation during 
the period between the last two censuses. 
Proceeding, then, by this method it is found that the population on 
December 31, 1889, would be 29,969,654, while if the excess of the 
births over the deaths were added between the dates 1882-1889 to the 
population of 1881, the result would be 30,946,317, which exceeds by 
more than 1,000,000 the number estimated by the first method. 
The increase in the number of elementary schools and in enrollment 
was more rapid during the period which followed the formation of the 
Kingdom of Italy than it is to-day. 
The ratio of increase is as follows:

1871-72 to 1889-9 2.06 1.23 
  
There are also elementary, evening, holiday, and adult schools sup- 
plementary to the public day schools. It is not considered obligatory 
upon the communes to support many of these schools; the number 
is quite large, however, and most of them receive subsidies. The 
number of the evening and holiday schools, with their enrollmént, is 
here presented for certain years between 1861-62 and 1889-90:

    a Statistics of evening schools in 1892-93: Class rooms, 3,492; teachers, 3,639; pupils, 128,780 (boys, 124,789; girls, 3,991). Holiday schools: Class rooms, 2,454; teachers, 2,507; pupils, 64,580 (boys, 15,086; girls, 49,494). 
The increase in the number of schools and pupils is of signifi- 
cance as tending to account for the decrease of illiteracy shown by 
the three successive censuses as that illiteracy bears upon the total 
population, the various classes, and the age. At least, it bears upon 
the number of recruits and illiterate married people to every 100

NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The normal schools serve as preparatory schools for teachers of the 
elementary grades. The State provides the funds for the teaching 
foree and for scientific apparatus. The remaining expenditures and 
those for the ‘“Convitti” (establishments where pupils are boarded 
and lodged) are paid by the provinces and communes in which the 
normals are located. 
There are still other schools of this character for the training of teach- 
ers which are maintained exclusively by provinces and communes, by 
corporations or individuals, while some receive State subsidies. 
The normal schools are of higher and lower grades for men and for 
women. The lower-grade normal schools have only the power to confer 
teachers’ diplomas for the three lower classes of the lower-grade ele- 
mentary schools. The higher-grade normals, on the contrary, confer 
the diploma required to teach in the elementary schools of both higher 
and lower grade. In the normal schools for women a certificate or 
diploma is also conferred, which permits its holder to become a teacher 
in or directress of an infant school. 
Instruction in the normal schools is gratuitous. The course is one of 
two years in the lower-grade normals, and is preceded by a preparatory 
course of three years. 
An examination for admission is required of those who wish to enter 
the normal schools. Each normal has a practice school attached, in 
which the pupil can obtain practice in teaching. The normals for 
women have also an infant school attached, which is divided into three 
sections. 
Persons desiring to obtain a teacher’s position in the elementary 
schools are appointed by the communes (which pay them), after compet- 
ing for such position in a competitive examination before the provincial 
school council. This council, after examining as to their qualifications,
-P-A-G-E-607
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 549 
presents the list of persons eligible to such positions, and the communal 
council has the duty to select and appoint the teachers. To determine 
the minimum legal salary for teachers, the elementary schools are- 
divided into two categories, urban and rural, and each of these catego- 
ries into three classes, in accordance with the wealth and population of 
the commune. The minimum legal stipendia, according to law of April 
11, 1886, are as follows: 
| City school

The stipends are augmented one-tenth for every six years of service 
in the same commune until the salary has been increased four times. 
The following table indicates the number of normal schools and pupils 
for certain years commencing with 1861-62:

aIn 1892-93 there were 148 normal schools (100 Government), 1,534 teachers (1,034 in Government normal schools), 18,677 pupils (14,493 in Government schools). Of the pupils 1,703 were men, 16,974 women. 
There are other institutes auxiliary or complementary to those for 
elementary instruction. Among the first-mentioned are two ‘“convitti” 
(establishments where pupils are boarded and lodged and which have 
elementary schools attached) for the orphans of elementary teachers, 
and the institutions for the blind and deaf-mutes; among the second 
are comprised the “convitti,” the educational institutions for girls and 
the two higher-grade normals for girls. 
The expenditures for the elementary, evening, and holiday schools, 
for the normals, and for the other institutions noted above, infant schools 
excluded, however, are as follows: In 1888-89 the provinces expended. 
$153,892; the communes, $10,866,756. In 1890-91 the State expended 
$1,648,452.

SECONDARY CLASSICAL AND TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. 
The aim of secondary classical instruction is to train young men in 
the studies requisite for acquiring the literary and philosophical knowl- 
edge which entitles them to enter upon special studies leading to. the 
academic grades of a university. These branches of instruction are 
imparted in the “ginnasio” (lower grade classical school) in a five-years 
term, and in the “liceo” (higher grade classical school) in a three- 
years term. In order to be admitted to Class I of a “ginnasio” the 
student is required to pass an entrance examination in the branches of 
the higher elementary grade, and in order to be admitted to the first year 
of a “liceo” it is necessary to possess a gymnasial license (licenza gin- 
nasiale), while the license of a “liceo” (licenza liceale) is required for 
admittance to a university course. The “ginnasi” are supposed to be 
supported by the communes, but in some provinces the State maintains 
them, in accordance with special laws. 
The “licei” are supported by the State, as far as the expenditures 
for teachers and scientific material are concerned; the expenditures for 
the buildings and furniture are borne by the communes. 
The State, either by law or by special agreement with the communes 
or other corporations, cooperates in maintaining the “ginnasi” and 
nongovernmental “‘licei.”. The communes, corporate bodies, and private 
individuals support similar institutions. 
The State, moreover, maintains the “convitti” annexed to the gov- 
ernmental “ginnasi” and “licei,” and, by law or special agreement, it 
also subsidizes other “convitti,” whose maintenance would naturally 
belong to a province, commune, or to a corporate body or association. 
The aim of technical-professional instruction is to impart to young 
men who are ambitious to enter upon a specified career in the public 
service, i. e., in industrial, commercial, and skilled agricultural pursuits, 
such general and special knowledge as is required for these pursuits. 
This knowledge is acquired and taught in technical schools, techni- 
cal institutes, and in the institutes for the mercantile marine. 
The course of instruction in the technical schools lasts three years, 
at the end of which a diploma is given to the successful candidates; 
this diploma is required for admission to a technical institute or to an 
institute for the mercantile-marine service. In the technical institute 
the instruction is divided, according to the profession to be pursued, 
into 5 sections, namely, physico-mathematics, land surveying, agricul- 
ture, commerce and trade, and industrial pursuits. 
The courses last four years, and are divided into two biennial periods; 
one common to all sections, and one a special course for each section. 
In the institutes for the mercantile-marine service the instruction is 
divided into 6 sections, viz, as captains for the coast service, naval 
constructors of the second class, and machinists of the second class, 
a two-years course; captain for long-distance courses and naval con-
-P-A-G-E-609
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 551 
structors of the first class, a three-years course; and machinists of the 
first class a four-years course. 
The diploma of the physico-mathematical section entitles, as does 
the “licenza liceale,” to admission into the faculty for physical, mathe- 
matical, and natural sciences of a university. 
The following table presents the number of institutes in which 
secondary classical and technical instruction is given, and the number 
of students enrolled:

a In 1891-92 there were 735 “ ginnasi” (178 State, 557 public or private) with 4,429 professors; students 
57,525 (in State ginnasi 2: public or private 32,145). The “licei”” numbered 321 (State 113, others 
208) ; professors 1,853; students 15,713 (State | 9,371, in other licei 6,342). The technical schools num- 
ered 399 (State 184, others 215) ; professors 2, 893 ; ‘students 34,244 (State 21,411, others 12,833.) ‘Tech- 
nical institutes 74 (State 54); professors 1,315 dents 8,647 (in State institutes 7,203). There were 21 
naval institutes—“ istituti nautici” training for the maritime service—(of theso 19 Government) 
with 179 professors; students 1,320 (in Government 1 ,301). 
b Until the close of 1879-80 there were no statistics published for nongovernment institutes.     
        
The maintenance of the technical schools is imposed upon the com- 
munes where they are established. The State pays half of the teach- 
ers’ expenses, however. In some cases, in accordance with special laws, 
technical schools are entirely in charge of the State. 
The expenditures for the technical institutes and for those of the mer- 
cantile marine are borne in part by the State, which pays half of the
-P-A-G-E-610
Te ee ee an 
552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. | 
expenses for the teachers and other employees, and in part by the proy- 
inces and communes. 
The expenditures for buildings and nonscientific material are fur- 
nished by the communes where the institutes are situated. 
The expenditures for classical and technical schools and for the 
“convitti” for boys were accredited as follows—to the State, communes, 
and provinces—during the years 1888-89 and 1890-91: 
   
    Provinces (1888-89) . .. - $447, 128 
Communes (1888-89) . 1, 396, 698 
State (1890-91)... - 2,389, 207 
Still another class of instruction is imparted in institutes and special 
schools, such as practical schools of agriculture, agrarian schools, indus- 
trial schools, schools of art and trade, and professional schools. The 
expenditures are paid in part by the State, which, through subsidies 
given to the ministry of agriculture, industry, and commerce, in accord- 
ance with special laws to that effect, cooperates with the provinces, 
communes, and other corporate bodies. In order to secure admission 
to one of these schools it is necessary to have successfully finished the 
elementary courses or otherwise to have passed an examination for 
admission. 
During the school years 1888-89 and 1890-91 the expenditures for 
this class of schools were distributed as follows: 
Provinces (1888-89) $125, 677 
Communes (1888-89) 325, 498 
State (1890-91) 439, 655       
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
The highest grade of education is furnished in the universities, the 
superior institutes, and in superior special schools. The “ Istituti 
Superiori” include the schools for engineers, the veterinary schools, the 
literary and scientific academy, the higher normal school for instruc- 
tion in literature, and the superior institute for the perfecting of studies 
in Florence with its university faculties. _ 
The universities comprise in general four faculties—law; philosophy 
andletters; physical, mathematical, and natural sciences; and medicine 
and surgery. 
In some universities the schools of pharmacy and veterinary schools 
are annexed to the faculty of medicine and surgery. Not all universi- 
ties have four faculties. The degree of doctor (Laurea) is conferred in 
each faculty at the close of the course. In the higher institutes there are 
faculties or sections of faculties where doctors’ degrees and diplomas 
are conferred at the close of the course, 
In the special schools diplomas are given for the different subjects 
taught there. 
The special schools are the superior commercial schools, whose pur- 
pose it is to prepare young men for the management of banking and
-P-A-G-E-611

commercial institutions, or for the career of consular agents in foreign 
countries, or for the position of instructors in the science of economics. 
in technical institutes; the superior agricultural schools, which prepare 
teachers of agricultural sciences and to promote agricultural interests 
by means of experimental research; the superior naval school, for the 
training of naval and hydrographic engineers and naval constructors; 
the institute of forestry, for training persons as forest inspectors; and 
the industrial museum, for training as mechanical engineers (ingegneri- 
industriale), chemistry, and in special branches of mechanics and 
physics. 
The expenditures for universities and superior institutes are in 
charge of the State and are included in the budget of the ministry of 
public instruction, The revenues and property of these institutions 
aid in their maintenance, and the fund is added to that administered by 
the State. 
Some provinces cooperate, by means of special contracts with the 
State in the payment of expenditures for the increase of scientific 
apparatus, for the annexed schools, for the laboratories, and collections 
of the universities which are located in the respective provinces or com- 
munes. There are 17 Government universities. Four are called “free,” 
because they are maintained by the provinces and communes where 
they are situated. The superior institutes are under Government con- 
trol, and are 11 in number. 
The superior special schools are also 11 in number, and are maintained 
by the State (the fund being included in the budget of the ministry of 
agriculture, industry, and commerce) in conjunction with the provinces 
and communes where they are situated. 
The two superior institutes for the education of women are depend- 
ent on the ministry of public instruction, to the accounts of which the 
expenditures are charged. The following table gives a survey of the 
universities, the superior institutes, and the superior special schools, 
with a summary of the number of students enrolled in said institutes,

a@ In 1891-92 there were 17,347 students and hearers and 1,493 professors in State universities; in free 
(ibora) universities, 445 sitidents and 79 professors. In the superior institutes, 2,033 students and 233 professors; in superior special schools, 860 students and 158 professors. 
The expenditures borne by the State for universities and other 
institutes and special schools amounted to $2,077,959 for the school 
year 1890-91, which sum was included in the budget of the minister of 
public instruction, and $112,905 in the budget of the ministry of agri- 
culture, industry, and commerce, 
 
-P-A-G-E-613
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 555 
The amounts contributed by the provinces and communes to the 
funds of universities, superior institutes, and superior special schools 
are added to the provincial and communal budgets. This fund is sep- 
arate from the amounts furnished by the associations or corporate 
bodies for the general increase and progress of studies. To this latter 
amount the provinces furnished $457,811 and the communes $829,190 
for the year 1888-89. 
But the State revenues for this year indicate that the provinces and 
communes will only cooperate to the extent of $152,536 in the mainte- 
nance of universities and other institutions administered by the State. 
The superior special schools, as has been mentioned before, are founded 
and maintained conjointly by the State, the provinces, and the com- 
munes, and are managed by local commissions, which include in their 
membership representatives from corporate bodies which aid in the 
maintenance of said institutions. 
As appendix to this article, we add the latest statistics of universi-

Through the courtesy of the editor of the North American Review 
(December, 1894, pp. 641-664), we have been permitted to make extracts 
from an article on the above subject, written by Archbishop Satolli 
(since created cardinal). This article clearly defines the work done by 
the papal authorities in Rome since 1870: 
The education furnished in the Catholic schools of Rome is open to all classes, and, 
although their supreme aim is to educate the new generation in a Christian manner, 
they vary in method according to the grade, from the infant asylum up to the uni- 
versity courses, which are still exclusively reserved to the State by law. Thenumber 
of Catholic schools is extraordinarily large, exceeding both that of the Government 
and municipal schools. 
The supreme direction of all these schools is vested in the cardinal vicar, for the 
congregation of studies has only the surveillance of the higher courses of the clerical 
institutes. He is assisted in the direction of the elementary schools— 
(1) By the pontifical commission, appointed by his holiness in accordance with 
the letter addressed to the cardinal vicar, dated June 26, 1878. Of this commission 
the monsignor vicegerent is the head. 
(2) By special committee for the schools which are founded and maintained by the 
Society of Catholic Interests. 
(3) By a special committee for the catechetical evening or night schools. 
(4) By a special committee for the schools which are dependent on the apostolic 
almonry. 
(5) By a special committee for the night and evening schools. 
These committees, although each is independent of the other in its sphere of action, 
are all subject in general matters to the pontifical commission, in which each of them
-P-A-G-E-615
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 557 
is represented by one or more members. This tie, far from being an impediment to 
the development and progress of the various institutions, rather helps to keep them 
united by harmonizing their actions in such a way that their work does not conflict. 
The pontifical, commission, however, reserves the right to regulate questions of 
discipline, to compile the programmes, select the text-books, fix the days for exami- 
nation, and other similar matters. It has also charge of the correspondence with the 
Holy See and the administration of the subsidies given by the Holy Father or by 
private bodies or individuals. 
Two inspectors are assigned to the supervision of the schools which are under the 
immediate direction of the commission. The committces provide for the other 
schools. In addition to these inspectors, every member of the commission having 
the title of ‘‘ patron” has the supervision of a certain number of schools. Two hun- 
dred and eleven different directors, divided up as follows, represent the commission 
and the committees at the various schools:

  As arule, the directors are not obliged to teach. The selection and inspection of 
localities are intrusted to an architect, who is attached to the pontifical commission. 
In the direction of the higher and technical schools the cardinal vicar is assisted by 
a council of direction, which possesses the same powers as regards the high schools 
as the pontifical commission has over the primary schools. The members of both 
these bodies—clergy as well as laity—are noted for their nobility of birth, as well as 
for piety and learning. In addition to these, there are also high schools, which, 
although they follow the regulations of the others, may be called independent, inas- 
much as they belong to tho religious corporations. The number and classification of 
these schools will be found in Tables A and B:

In speaking of the distribution of schools, Mgr. Satolli says: 
It has been the wise and constant aim of the pontifical commission, aided by the 
religious corporations, to distribute the elementary schools as widely as possible and 
to conduct them in such a manner that, by their discipline, by tho choice ef teachers, 
by the excellence of their method of teaching and their educative course, they should 
merit the sympathy of the public and the confidence of the family. * * * 
The pontifical commission therefore did well in avoiding the plan of erecting large 
schools at a considerable distance apart and in deciding to establish a number of 
smaller schools, which, though more modest, would be convenient to all. Asa result, 
there is not only not a parish, but there is hardly a street of any importancein Rome, 
that does not possess a Catholic school. It must not be inferred from this that the 
Catholics lack great scholastic edifices. On the contrary, in the past few years 
some beautiful buildings have been erected through the instrumentality of religious 
corporations. 
Mgr. Satolli lays stress upon the fact that— 
The first requisite of a good school is to have good teachers. * * * 
And atthis point it is only proper to pay a tribute of praise to the religious corpo- 
rations, which have stopped at no expense or sacrifice to provide the commission with 
a select body of teachers, both men and women, furnished with proper diplomas, and 
who, by their ability, zeal, and spotless character, have merited and enjoy to the full 
the confidence, not only of the commission, but of the public. 
Teachers had also to be provided for such schools as were not dependent on reli- 
gious corporations, of which there are a considerable number, and experience has 
shown it to be very difficult to obtain teachers who, in addition to their professional 
diplomas of residence, offer those secure guaranties of sound principles and morality 
which are indispensable for those who teach in Catholic schools. The pontifical 
commission therefore deemed it advisable to establish normal or teachers’ schools 
designed to prepare their scholars for the career of teachers. The first of these to be
-P-A-G-E-617
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 569 
established was one for women, and is called St. Catherine’s Institute. Another 
similar college for men was founded two years ago. St. Catherine’s Institute, which 
has now been in existence fourteen years, has been productive of excellent results, 
inasmuch as it not only furnishes the best teachers for Catholic schools, but its grad- 
uates are even sought after by the municipality, which justly esteems them for their 
culture and conduct. The same gratifying results are confidently expected from the 
male college when its courses shall have been completed. * * * 
Speaking of the course of study, Mgr. Satolli says: 
In the compilation of the programmes the commission endeavors to bring them as 
far as possible into harmony with those in use in the public schools, both as regards 
the division of classes and the courses of studies. In the schools for girls a finish- 
ing course of two years was added, so that the pupils, especially in the academies, 
might be able to acquire a superior education to that imparted at the elementary 
Benoolss.. 8 oi" 5 
As regards the method of teaching, the commission strongly urged the teachers to 
adhere to the old system, which means that method by following which Dante, keen- 
est of observers, noted the most relevant facts of life and of the physical world; 
by which Columbus discovered America and Galileo left, in the sphere of physical 
study, an immortal record. It is the method of observation which the modern Ital- 
ian pedagogues very unpatriotically declare to have come from over the Alps, while, 
as amatter of fact, if it can be called the glory of any country, it is the glory of 
Italy. 
The commission decreed that this method should be applied in an Italian spirit— 
that is, without northern vagueness and exaggeration, and not as a means of com- 
bating the supernatural, but of ascending toward it. It holds that the teaching of 
the school is intended for life, and for the whole life, for man does not live by bread 
al GROscp es 
While the pontifical commission was engaged in the direction of the elementary, 
schools the directive council worked with equal zeal in the management of the 
high schools. Of the two the latter are the more important, because while the first 
provide for the education of the lower classes, the second initiate into the sciences 
and to an upright life that class which, fresh from the universities, is destined to 
form the cultured and influential section of society. 
There are in Romo 18 high schools dependent on the Holy See, viz, 5 lyceums,! 
5 gymnasiums, 5 technical schools, 2 normal schools, and 1 technical institute of 
higher grade. [See Table C.]

The technical and normal schools, as well as the technical institutes, have all been 
* founded since 1870—partly during the pontificate of Pius IX and partly during that 
of Leo XIII. Of the gymnasiums and lyceums 3 have been established since that 
date; the others were already in existence, but owing to the new laws it became 
necessary to reform them in many respects. 
Of these 18 institutes 7 belong to religious corporations, the remainder being 
directly dependent on the directive council and pontifical commission. The Collegio 
Nazzareno, which is a most flourishing institution, is not included among this num- 
ber, because, although founded and directed by the Fathers of the Pious Schools, it 
is under the jurisdiction of the local authorities. 
As against these 18 Catholic institutions there are in Rome 19 State and 1 munici- 
pal high school—that is, 3 lyceums, 4 gymnasiums, 8 technical schools, 3 normal 
schools, and 1 higher technical institute. If we take into account the lyceum- 
gymnasium of the Collegio Nazzareno, the Catholic high schools equal in number 
those of the Government. 
In speaking of the religious side of education, Mgr. Satolli says: 
The commission has continually reminded the teachers that instruction is good 
only when it is united with an earnest moral and religious education. It therefore 
decreed that a fixed time should be set apart daily for catechism, so that the pupils 
from their earliest years should be familiarized with those pious practices which 
form the character of the true Christian. * * * 
The commission, moreover, being fully convinced that no branch of study, espe- 
cially philosophy or history, can be correctly and completely taught without the aid 
of religion, which like a luminous beacon guides the understanding, directed that 
! Special classes. 
*The oratory is attended by 700 pupils.
-P-A-G-E-619
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 561 
religious instruction should be given at least once a week in all the schools and classes, 
with a view not only to improve the minds of the pupils, but as the most effectual 
means of imparting that complete religious and moral education which is the supreme 
aim of Catholic schools, 
In order that the pupils may from their earliest years become familiar with the 
practices of Christian piety, sodalities have been formed, each of which has a spirit- 
ual director, whose duty it is to see that the members comply with the rules and fulfill 
all their religious duties. Special spiritual exercises aro held by these sodalities at 
Easter, when children whose parents desire it are prepared for their first communion. 
Tho work of the pontifical commission and directive council does not end with the 
direction of the elementary and high schools, for there is no class of citizens for which 
these bodies, aided by the religious corporations, have not provided the means of 
obtaining a Christian education and the highest grade of culture in the easiest 
manner. 
Acting on the advice of the directive council, the holy father founded in Rome 2 
institutes of superior courses or finishing courses, namely, the Academy of Historic 
Jurisprudence and the School of Higher Literature, and selected as their professors 
men noted for their scientific and literary attainments. The first of these institu- 
tions is devoted to jurisprudence, history, and archology; the second to ancient and 
modern literature. ‘ 
Boarding houses.—Two boarding houses have been provided for the scholars who 
come to Rome from the provinces. One of these has been in existence for many 
years and is set apart for those who attend the university courses; the other, whichis 
for the girls who attend the teachers’ institute, was erected by a committee of ladies 
as a memorial of the episcopal jubilee of the holy father, and by them turned over 
to the deserving Salesian Missionary Sisters. It is not only required that those who 
are admitted to these houses fulfill their duties as good Christians, but, in addition, 
religious, scientific, and literary conferences are frequently held, with a view to 
confirming the scholars in good principles. 
Boarding schools.—There are in Rome 26 boarding schools, of which number 5 are 
for boys and 21 for girls. They are attended by 395 boys and 1,072 girls. All these 
schools belong to religious corporations. It is needless to add that the seminaries 
for the clergy, of which there is a very large number, are not included under this 
head. The rate charged at these boarding schools ranges from 30 to 80 lire monthly 
($5.79 to $15.44), so that they are accessible to families of moderate means as well 
as to those of affluence. In some of these schools free scholarships have been 
established. * * 
In describing the boarding schools for girls Mgr. Satolli says: 
The instruction given to.the girls in these boarding schools is divided into two 
grades—elementary and superior. In some of them the entire normal course is given, 
thus enabling such pupils as desire it to obtain diplomas. The sisters who conduct 
these courses are furnished with diplomas of professorship, obtained after examina- 
tion atthe State universities. In the examination which took place for this purpose 
four years ago by concessions of the minister, tho Sisters of St. Ann of Providence, 
the Oblates of the Infant Jesus, the Ladies of the Sacred Heart, the Marcelline Sis- 
ters, and the Sisters of St. Joseph especially distinguished themselves. 
The Government maintains in Rome two colleges, viz, a boarding school for girls, 
which is attached to the normal school, and the provincial school for boys. 
Semiboarding schools.—To a number of these boarding schools are attached what 
are known as ‘‘mezza pensione;” that is, schools attended by day scholars who take 
their midday meal there. They are a comparatively new institution, and have met 
with much favor among the families who have taken advantage of them. 
Orphan and other asylums.—No city of Italy, or, indeed, in the world, possesses in 
comparison so many charitable institutions for every class of poor and suffering 
persons as Rome. * * *
-P-A-G-E-620
562 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Not to mention those institutions which do not come within the scope of this 
article or those which existed prior to 1870, I shall only allude briefly to the ones 
established since that date. Preeminent among these is the Hospice of the Sacred 
Heart, conducted by the Salesians, which was opened last year by the cardinal 
vicar as a memorial of the episcopal jubilee of the holy father. It is an immense 
building of beautiful design, and includes not only elementary schools but also art 
and industrial schools, a gymnasium, and library. The scholars who attend the day 
or night schools here are educated gratuitously, and only a very small fee is charged 
for the boarders. This institution contains in all about 300 pupils. * * * 
Another institution which is maintained by voluntary contributions is the Pious 
Instituto of the Immaculate Conception, which was founded by the Brothers of 
Charity, familiarly known as the Grey Brothers. It receives orphans gratuitously, 
and also maintains day and boarding schools containing about 400 pupils. 
The orphan asylum of the Sisters of Cluny, of St. Jerome Emiliani, the Protectory 
of St. Joseph, the Asylum of the Sisters of Nancy for Idiot Children, and tho Insti- 
tute for Abandoned Orphans, conducted by the Daughters of the Passion of Calvary, 
should also be included under this head. 
In cach of these charitablo institutions the inmates, in addition to receiving an 
elementary education, aro specially instructed in some art or trade, thus enabling 
them to carn an honest livelihood in after life. 
Infant asylums.—The pontifical commission has under its jurisdiction 40 infant 
asylums, of which 32 are free. As against these the municipality has only 12, In 
these asylums, as in every other Catholic institution, every, part of the modern 
method which is good and useful has been adopted. * 
Art and trade schools.—Among the art and trade schools in Rome are the Institute 
of Pius IX and the Hospice Bonanni, for young artisans; the Institute of Vigna Pia, 
for instructing poor boys in agriculture, and that of Tata Giovanni, where the poor 
are instructed in various arts and trades. 
In all the above, in addition to reading and writing, special care is given to the 
study of design, which is accounted a great aid in learning the arts and trades. The 
evening schools, founded by the Artisan and Working Society, hold examinations 
yearly of the work of the pupils, which is executed accurately and artistically. * * * 
Industrial schools.—In addition to the higher courses and finishing courses adapted 
to the daughters of wealthy parents, industrial schools were opened for girls belong- 
ing to the poorer classes. Only those girls are admitted to these schools who have 
completed the higher courses in the elementary schools, although pupils who have 
only passed the third class are sometimes admitted. Embroidery of various kinds, 
sewing, cutting garments, ironing, repairing, and every other branch of housework 
necessary to qualify the pupils to earn their livelihood are taught here. The most 
skillful pupils are rewarded by a small daily honorarium. Somo of these pupils 
have earned such a reputation for good work among the people that they receive 
moro work than they can execute. 
The professional schools under the direction of the Sisters of Charity of St. Vin- 
cent de Paul and of the Sisters of Divine Providence in the Piazza Fiammetta are 
specially noted for the excellent quality of their work as well as for the number of 
their pupils. 
Catcchetical echools—These schools were especially established for the boys and 
girls who attend the State or municipal schools where no religious instruction is 
given. There are 15 of these schools, 8 for boys and 7 for girls, the average yearly 
attendance being 1,445. These schools are a most efficacious help to the clergy, for, 
like tho other Catholic schools, they help to prepare tho boys and girls for their first 
communion and to instruct them in the duties of a good Christian. 
Sunday schools, which have the same object as the catechetical schools, are 18 in 
number, and contain 1,274 pupils. 
Owing to lack of space, it is impossible to describe all the other Catholic institu-

tions in Rome which havo for their aim the education of youth. No mention can 
therefore be made of the Catholic clubs, the literary and scientific academies, read- 
ing and debating circles, ete. * * * 
Mgr. Satoili, referring to matters of discipline, states that— 
Tho schools are regarded by many parents simply as places where their children 
aro taken care of for a few hours daily; others look upen them as workshops where 
the children learn to read, write, cipher, and nothing else. Indeed, there are only a 
few who appreciate the exalted and delicate function of the schools. It has been 
wisely ordained that every Catholic school, especially the higher ones, should have 
aspecial prefect of discipline. This prefect watches the coming and going of the 
pupils from their classes, keeps a record of the absent and late ones, corresponds 
with the parents of the children, and sees that all the regulations are rigidly en- 
forced. The existence of this office helps not only to maintain discipline but is also 
an important factor in the proper progress of the studies, for the president and 
directors, being relieved of all care in matters of discipline, are freer to superintend 
the teaching and teachers. 
In order to excite in the pupils the spirit of emulation, prizes are offered at the 
beginning of each scholastic year. In the higher and paying schools silver medals 
and diplomas are awarded, while in the free schools gifts of clothing are bestowed. 
The punishments inflicted in the Catholic schools are similar to those in use in the 
State schools, but, happily, it is only very rarely that the severest one, expulsion, has 
to bo resorted to. 
In speaking of the expenditures, Mgr. Satolli says: 
It is difficult to form an accurato estimate of the amount expended on so many 
and such varied scholastic institutions as have been mentioned. The paying schools 
directed by the religious corporations, which provide for current expenses out of 
their own funds, in common with those which derive an annual allowance from 
the pontifical commission, depend upon public munificence and upon other sources 
for the balance necessary for their support. Nearly all the primary schools, and 
also the secondary institutes, which are directed by lay folk, are entirely depend- 
ent upon the pontifical commission and upon the school fund set apart by the holy 
father. 
Taking into account simply the amount furnished by the Pontifical commission 
and by the administration of the estates of the Holy See for the high schools, the 
annual expenditure exceeds 1,000,000 lire ($193,000). > 
The average yearly income of the pontifical cominission is about 400,000 lire 
($77,200), and the outlay nearly equals that amount. 
This income is derived— 
(1) From direct donations of the holy father. 
(2) From the administration of the estates of the Holy See. 
(3) From the donations of certain corporations of the chapters of*the patriarchal 
churches, and from the contributions of sacred congregations, and of some private 
individuals, 
(4) From the fees of the pupils of St. Catherine’s Institute and of the Gregorian 
College. 
With the amount thus obtained the pontifical commission provides— 
(1) For the ordinary and extraordinary allowances of the personnel. 
(2) For the furnishing, ete., of the schools. 
(8) For the distribution of books, etc., among the poor pupils. 
(4) For the rental of the schools and asylums, 
(5) For the erection and repairs of buildings. * * * 
All the members of the pontifical commission, including the president, who has 
the general direction of the schools as well as of the administrative office, give their 
services gratuitously.
-P-A-G-E-622
  564 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Thero are several schools, orphanages, and asylums, which do not derive their 
support from the pontifical commission, but which are maintained exclusively by 
the Roman aristocracy or by Catholic societies or committees. 
If the amount which is spent by the religious corporations and that which is saved 
by their giving their services gratuitously, as well as the sum which is derived 
annually from public and private benefactors, were added to the umount spent 
yearly by the pontifical commission, the expenses for primary Catholic education in 
Rome would reach a total of at least 1,500,000 lire yearly ($289,500). 
Among the schools wholly maintained Ly the administration of the estates of the 
Holy See are the Historical-Juridical Academy, the School of Higher Literature, also 
ealled the Leonine Institute, the Lyceum-Gymnasium, the Technical School Angelo 
Mai, and the Technical Institute De Merode. 
With the exception of the Leonine Institute, the administration of all these 
institutions is vested in the directive council. 
In summing up the work done in these various institutions, Mgr. 
Satolli states that— 
The supreme end of these institutions, which is religious and moral education, has 
not been neglected in the regulations, programmes, books, or methods of teaching; 
and it has been their special aim to deviate as little as possible from the national 
traditions, which so harmoniously combine faith and science, and to furnish the boys 
and girls of the new generation with that grade of culture which is best adapted to 
their social position. 
That the Roman people appreciate the beneficent efforts of the holy father and 
the work of all those who, with sentiments of profound admiration and reverence, 
assist him, is demonstrated by the ever-increasing number of pupils who flock to the 
Catholic schools. 
THE SCHOOLS OF LEGHORN IN 1893. 
An interesting presentation of the schools of Leghorn is made by the 
United States consul, Radcliffe H. Ford. It is here appended. 
Mr. Ford says: 
The schools of Leghorn compare favorably with those of the United States, con- 
sidering the time they have been. established, as, until the unification of all the 
provinces of Italy in 1870, there was no general school system. Leghorn has six 
schools devoted to the teaching of the higher branches and special courses, which 
are supported by the Government, aided by municipal contributions, ranging from 
$1,780 to $3,500 annually. There are 42 public schools supported entirely by the 
city, with an annual attendance of about 3,600 pupils, the annual cost of which is 
about $55,000. The establishing of these schools throughout Italy marks the first 
step of real progress for the common people, and can not help being manifest in the 
coming generations. Among the schools supported by the Government, with muni- 
cipal aid, are those known as mechanical and industrial schools. 
The schools in this district of an industrial nature, where trades or mechanical pro- 
fessions are taught, are situated in Leghorn, Volterra, and Carrara. The school at 
Leghorn is known as ‘Scuola di Arti e Mestieri” (School of Arts and Trades), and 
was established by the municipality under a royal decree in the year 1886, but only 
went into successful operation in 1888. It is a free school, supported by moneys 
derived from the following sources annually: 
City of Leghorn ... 
Province of Leghorn. 
Chamber of commerce, Leghorn -- 
Ministry of agriculture, industry, and commerce... 
National treasury for schools of machinists.......

The age for admission is from 12 to 16 years, and the most of the pupils enter at 
the carlier limit. For entrance it is necessary that the applicant have a certificate 
of promotion from the third to the fourth class of the regular public schools or pass 
an examination showing such proficiency in reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, 
and geography as would be necessary for such promotion. 
The school will accommodate 170 pupils, and the limit is full. 
There are four sections or divisions in the school, and the branches taught and 
length of course vary in different sections. The sections of the school are as follows: 
(1) Industrial and metallurgical, course three years, comprising arithmetic, geomet- 
rical drawing, decorative drawing, mechanical design of machinery, with practical 
work in machine shop, and in the last year technical electricity by oral lessons, with 
practical work in the manufacture of electricity by an electric-light plant. 
(2) Decorative arts, course three years, comprising arithmetic, geometry, decora- 
tive drawing, with practical work on room walls with oil colors, lithography, figura- 
tive drawing, also carving and modeling in wood, marble, plaster, and pottery. 
(3) Machinists and engineers, course two years, Italian language, arithmetic, 
geometry, algebra, drawing, with practical work in machine shop and on stationary 
steam engines. 
(4) Firemen, course one year, teaching by oral lessons of the construction and 
work of steam-engine boiler, with practical work on same. 
The first and second sections are day sessions, the third and fourth are eyening 
sessions. At the Government exhibition of last summer, at Palermo, for work by 
schools of this class, several of the pupils received medals and prizes for their pro- 
ficiency. The school has a room for machine work fitted with lathes and other 
machinery, the power for which is furnished by their own engine, and it also fur- 
nishes the power for an electric plant for lighting the building. 
At Volterra is a school known as the Industrial School of Volterra, but it is more 
properly a school of arts. The instructors teach geometrical, architectural, and fig- 
urative drawing, modeling in plaster, and decorative painting. The age of admis- 
sion is 12, and the same requirements for admission are necessary as at Leghorn; 
length of course, four years. It has been in existence since the early part of this 
century, and is now supported as a free school by the State and municipality. 
Regarding the schools of this class at Carrara, I quote Mr. Ulisse Boceacci, the 
consular agent, as follows: 
“The only educational school where an industrial and mechanical training is also 
given is the Scuola Industriale di Carrara, established in this city. It is one of the 
four similar schools of Italy. The other three are found at Agordo, Iglesias, and 
Caltanisetta. 
“The following are the studies taught at that school: Italian language, history, 
and geography; English language, industrial design, mathematics, physics, and 
chemistry ; topography and its applications, topographic design; mechanics, general 
and special; engineering design, mineralogy and geology, and quarry working. 
“The applicants can obtain admission by exhibiting a license of a Government 
technical school or an equal school (pareggiata). 
“The length of the course of training is two years, and, after having passed exam- 
ination, pupils may get a diploma of experts in mineralogy. 
“The school is public and without charge, and it is supported in equal proportion 
by the Government, the province, the municipality, and the Chamber of Commerce 
of Carrara. : 
“Tt was founded in the year 1872, with the title of Industrial School. In 1885 it 
was remodeled, adding to the teaching mineralogy. 
“Carrara has, besides, an academy of fine arts, where sculpture, architecture, and 
carving are taught. It was founded in the year 1769 by the Duchess of Este, reign- 
ing at that time in this district. 
“The pupils are admitted at the age of 14 years by application made in writing 
by their fathers or governors, accompanied by necessary documents.
-P-A-G-E-624
    566 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
“The length of the courses of training is from seven to ten years for sculpture 
and five years for architecture and ornaments. 
“The average number of pupils frequenting this school is about 250. 
“This school is likewise public and without charge, and it is entirely supported 
by the Government.” 
The law regarding apprenticeship is very similar to that of the New England 
States. A minor, with the consent of his father or guardian, may in writing 
indenture himself with a party for a term of years to be taught a trade. This, how- 
ever, is but seldom done now in this consular district. The agreements are usually 
oral when it is contemplated that the whole trade shall be learned from the same 
party, and stipulate that for the first two years the apprentice receives no wages; for 
the third year he receives, perhaps, one-half franc (about 10 cents) a day, increased 
from year to year until at the end of seven years he will receive from 2 to 2} francs 
aday. Tho apprentice under this agreement bears his own expenses. The most of 
the trades in reality are learned by the minor from the beginning as an assistant or 
general helper with some party, under whom he gradually acquires a knowledge 
of the trade, without any agreement between the parties for any special length of 
time. The learner may be employed by several persons before he masters the trade. 
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS.1 
These movements include the appointment of commissions to investi- 
gate the subject of school programmes and text-books and of physical 
culture. Then there have been discussions appertaining to manual 
training, to the prompt payment of teachers’ salaries, to increase of 
pensions for teachers, university reform movements, the more thorough 
education of women, the establishing of schools complementary to the 
elementary grades, the extension of obligatory school attendance to 
12 years of age, and the need of a more practical education for life’s 
duties. The subject of examinations for entrance to secondary schools 
has also been discussed, and the holding of the “licenza elementare” 
admits from State and private schools to secondary schools without 
other examinations. Students of gymnasia and lyceums receive the 
“licenza liceale” from 1894 on, if they have earned it by completion of 
three or five years of study, with the cum laude additional to the pass- 
ing of the examinations. With the “licenza liceale” scholarships are 
granted for further study in Rome or other prominent university cen- 
ters. The changes in the ministries? may have modified the carrying

out of these various plans, but enough has been done to indicate the 
efforts toward educational progress made by Italian statesmen. As 
far as can be ascertained, the educational movements which tend to 
become permanent bases of school operations are here noted. 
The heavy burden entailed upon the Italian Government by the effort 
to keep the army on a war footing seemed to necessitate cutting down 
the budget in other directions; hence an effort was made to close sey- 
eral of the universities! where there were but few students, and to 
bring those students to the large university centers, such as Naples, 
Turin, or Rome. In 1892-93 the Government eliminated from the 
budget the subsidies accorded to the free universities of Camerino, 
Ferrara, Urbino, and Perugia. ‘The students at once revolted; local 
pride and tradition were touched; great opposition was developed, and 
every effort that has been made so far to change existing conditions in 
the universities has met with similar opposition. There were so few 
students at Macerata (264), Cagliari (201), Modena (384), Parma (385), 
Sassari (157), and Siena (229) that the Government’s desire to suppress 
them seems but natural, if it is considered that the intellectual and 
financial benefits accruing to the public are not sufficient to warrant 
their continuance. However, the strong objections raised in those 
university centers led to a lowering of the subsidies for all universities 
that year (1892-93).

1According to Signor Martini, the universities are too numerous; there is defi- 
ciency in scientific appliances, and too great poverty of endowment. The possiblo 
remedies include restrictions in right of conferring degrees, greater autonomy in the 
management of each university, and the suppression of a certain number. (Nuova 
Antologia, March 15, 1894.)

There are doubtless other economies in the budget outside of those 
for universities. The programme of studies in the Italian universities 
ranks with that of prominent universities of Europe and, as is stated 
by Professor Oldrini, ‘‘in several branches, such as legal jurisprudence 
and moral and economic social sciences, Italy holds a prominent place 
among them.” The programmes of the universities and those of the 
special and superior institutes newly created within the last twenty 
years have been thoroughly modified according to the requirements of 
modern ideas and the advancement of sciences, literature, and arts. 
Among other things “sociology is taught in 10 universities and in 
several autonomous academies, and scientific pathological sociology 
forms a basis of treatment for the criminal.” 
In 1891-92 the minister of public instruction, Signor Pasquale Vil- 
lari, introduced a bill in the Chamber of Deputies modifying the 
organization of provincial school administration and another bill reor- 
ganizing the higher council of education. According to these bills, the 
“provveditore” and the school council of each province are to have 
only the elementary schools under their charge, while a new officer, 
“provveditore dell’ istruzione secondaria,” is to have charge of secondary 
education in the province. These officials are to reside in the cities of 
Turin, Milan, Padua, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples, Bari, Palermo, 
and Cagliari. Hach of these provveditore is to be assisted by a council 
for secondary education. The bill relative to the higher council of 
education reduces the number of its members from 36 to 24, who are to 
be appointed for six years, 4 of them going out each year, and they will 
only be eligible for reelection after a year’s interval. Of the 4 members 
to be appointed each year, 2 are to be chosen by the minister and 2 
others in turn designated (to the ministers) by the faculties of higher 
studies. It is somewhat doubtful whether these bills became laws, as 
Minister Villari was succeeded by Minister Martini in 1892 (May 15). 
Signor Villari’s successor submitted an elaborate and interesting pro- 
gramme of reforms in the educational organization of the Kingdom. 
He first proposed to establish a ‘‘scuola unica di cultura generale,” to 
follow after an elementary school course of five years’ duration. This 
institution is to combine some characteristics of the lower classes in the 
present “ ginnasio” with studies in similar classes of technical schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-627
  
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 569 
A three-years course is to serve as a preparatory course for practical 
life and for higher schools. The communes were expected to establish 
and in part maintain this “scuola unica,” but, as with other schools, a 
State subsidy is desired. The course is to be somewhat elective, so that 
students may pursue the studies most suited to their needs. 
The statement has been made that in the reorganization of public 
school education the elementary has been sacrificed to that of second- 
ary instruction. One of the Italian deputies, Signor Gallo, considered 
that individuals are mistaken who yield to secondary education the 
same efficacy as a means of educating the people as to elementary 
education. He also advocates a “school complementary to the elemen- 
tary,” where the pupils may be prepared for life’s duties and for the 
defense of the country. The reform movements tend, as different 
authorities indicate, to modify the traditional rigidity of Italian sec- 
ondary education and to introduce a more elastic and modern régime 
rather than to overturn the whole edifice. The figures indicate that 
the number of pupils in secondary schools has more than doubled 
within the last twenty years, and more progress is perceptible in these 
than in the elementary grades. Hence the greater effort to bring about. 
reform movements in the elementary grades by the appointment of 
commissions to investigate their needs, for it is stated that the methods 
now employed in elementary grades tend toward “the arid process of 
mental exercises to the detriment of the development of the reasoning 
power and of the moral aims of education.” In secondary school 
matters the discussions are, as in other countries, whether classical or 
a more practical education is necessary. The former acts as a discip- 
linary power, giving more intellectual force; the latter gives greater 
mastery over the material world and forms a stronger backbone to the 
nation. 
Signor Cavalotti, deputy, urges the doing away with the present cum- 
bersome school organization, the numerous officials, the surplus uniyer- 
sities, and that in place of so many “‘half-starved savants encumbering 
the social plane” there be established “practical training schools for 
citizens who will be of value to the nation.” 
The commission appointed to revise the programmes of elementary 
studies presented the result of their labors to the minister of public 
instruction on November 22, 1894, The general regulations of the 
year 1888 were adhered to, but there were special recommendations 
concerning education and discipline in general. Complaint was made 
all over Italy of too many studies, and of those unsuited to the age 
of the child, and of too many daily exercises. The effort of the com- 
mission was to bring the studies, which are to be fewer in number, 
within the scope of the child’s mind, and to reduce the number of 
hours a day in the classes. The subjects of study required for exami- 
nation are Italian (in which the child must give clear expression to his 
thoughts), penmanship, geography, arithmetic (the common rules), and
-P-A-G-E-628

history (local and general of Italy of past and present periods), and 
the duties of citizenship. There are exercises in gymnastics, singing, 
and needlework, but discretionary powers are given to the teachers. 
Morals are taught by example rather than by any set lessons to the. 
pupils. The higher problems of arithmetic are relegated to the see- 
ondary schools. The programme covers the years 6 to 10, and if still 
further elementary instruction is needed there are the Sunday and 
holiday schools, 
As an indication of the methods of study and recitations required in 
the elementary grades, the code of education is cited in part. Reforms 
now tend toward more simple methods: 
Preliminary instruction.—In the elementary schools arithmetic must be taught in a 
manner altogether practical. Let the master abstain from giving demonstrations 
which would not be understood at that tender age. Let him limit himself to 
impressing well on the minds of the pupils the definitions and the working of the 
“four rules,” and to see that they are worked expeditiously and without hesitation. 
When the teacher proposes concrete problems the questions proposed must be 
most simple, so that the pupils may readily perceive the connection between the 
requirements of the problem and the particular operations required for its solution. 
To teach what little is requisite of the notation of vulgar fractions let the teacher 
begin by explaining with precision the meaning of the fractions 4, $, 4, }, ete., and 
let him subsequently cause the pupils to construct tables of the multiples of these 
fractions. 
From such tables will naturally follow the notions of proper and improper frac- 
tions, and of mixed numbers, the idea of composite numbers, and the rule for 
converting an improper fraction into a mixed number, and vice versa. 
In teaching the rule of three let the teacher’s principal aim be to communicate to 
his pupils a sure criterion for distinguishing the cases to which this rule applies. 
First year.--Mental exercise in addition and subtraction. Reading and writing of 
Arabie figures. 
Second year.—Numeration and notation of numbers with several digits. Addition 
and subtraction of integers. Multiplication by integers. 
Third year.—Division of integers. The four rules with decimals. Definition and 
free-hand drawing of the most important geometrical figures. The metric system. 
Solution of simple problems with concrete numbers. 
Fourth year—Meaning of a fraction. Proper and improper fractions and mixed 
numbers. Interconversion of fractions. Reduction of an improper fraction to a 
mixed number, and vice versa. Conversion of a vulgar fraction to a decimal. Rule 
of three by unitary method. Applications. 
A.—FIRST CLASS (LOWER SECTION). 
Italian language.—Graduated exercises in formation of syllables, analyzing words 
selected for that purpose and explained. Formation of letters, syllables, and words

grammar. Elementary knowledge of analysis. Short and easy composition by

In the teaching of geography attention is called to geography of the first three 
classes in the gymnasium. This study must be directed to a double purpose: First, 
to give to the students (and especially those who will not attend the higher classes) 
an elementary but complete knowledge of tho earth, and particularly of Italy; and, 
secondly, to be auxiliary to the study of history. 
That the knowledge of the carth may be, albeit elementary, yet complete, it must 
comprise mathematical, astronomical, physical, and political geography. But inall 
this, having regard to the nature of the science and to the tender age of the pupils, 
itis necessary that the professor should proceed with foresight in the selection of 
the matter to be taught, dwelling on principles, and illustrating them in such a 
manner as to render them clear to the intelligence of the students, taking care, 
however, that the popular explanations and illustrations which he makes use of do 
not militate against scientific explanations; and further, that he should not sub- 
stitute some mere practical process for one thoroughly scientific, since frequently 
itis the case that, to understand or remember a fact better, it seems advantageous 
to communicate extrinsic facts, rather than to thoroughly investigate their intrinsic 
nature and their correlation to each other. 
This premised, the study of geography is divided as follows: 
First elass.—General notions of astronomical, topographical, physical, and political 
geography. Detailed geography of Italy. 
Second class.—Geography of the Old World. 
Third class —Geography of America and Australia. Systematic recapitulation. 
That the teaching may be easy, efficacious, and most fruitful it must be given 
viva voce, with no other help but the artificial globe and maps. 
The student should imprint on his mind the form of the earth, her parts, and 
principal subdivisions and phenomena (accidenti), and the political arrangement in 
outline. 
The reading of the programmes for the higher schools of the King- 
dom suggest, among other things, the advantage which teachers in 
Italian schools enjoy with regard to the teaching of history. In no 
other country! can the course of universal history be so easily and 
naturally combined with the history of the nation, while the distinction

572 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
between ancient and modern is to a great extent obliterated by the 
continuity of Rome. The history programme for the higher schools 
marks off five periods: (1) Greek history; (2) Roman history, from 
the origin-of Rome to the fall of the Western Empire; (3) history of 
Europe, with special reference to Italy, from the fall of the Western 
Empire to the discovery of America; (4) from the discovery of America 
to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; (5) from the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle 
to the death of Victor Emmanuel. 
In Italy also the question of gymnastics has attracted much atten- 
tion, and a commission has lately presented its report ov the principles 
to be followed in teaching them, or, rather, in training masters and 
mistresses to teach them, in the normal schools of gymnastics which 
are already established at Rome, Naples, and Turin. The report pro- 
nounces for a combination of gymnastics with apparatus, and natural 
gymnastics, i.e., athletics and games. The programme for the training 
of teachers includes such instruction in anatomy and physiology as is 
necessary for mastering the theory of the subject. Practical gymnastics 
are to include various athletic exercises and games, swimming (for both 
sexes), and single-stick and some sword exercises (for boys). 
According to the report in regard to “Hiducazione fisica nelle scuole,” 
published in the Bollettino Ufficiale dell’ Istruzione pubblica, November 
30, 1893, the commission for the study of physical training desires to 
formulate regulations which will tend to form healthy and robust men 
as useful citizens and prepared to defend the country in moments of 
peril. Stress is laid upon the care that teachers should have in regard 
to the use of apparatus unsuited to youths under 14 years of age, and 
special care must be taken in these exercises as to the overuse of gym- 
nastics by girls of any age. Teachers are to be thoroughly trained in 
the use and abuse of gymnastics, or there can never be a rational 
application of such exercises. Buildings or rooms should be large and 
well ventilated, to be useful for purposes of physical training. The 
president of the commission, Signor I, Todaro, suggests that a perma- 
nent commission be appointed for the study and supervision of physical 
training, and that the numerous Italian gymnastic societies (more than 
100) be encouraged to form a sort of federation, to place their courses 
before the minister of public instruction, to join with the commission 
in developing the best methods for physical culture, and that subsidies 
be granted to promote the extension of physical training. He hopes 
that playgrounds may be established, athletic games encouraged, row- 
ing, climbing mountains, riding, and in fact that everything pertaining 
to the development of the body may be encouraged by the authorities. 
The commission does not suggest the introduction of military training 
into the schools, but limits itself to such training as would naturally 
come under the heading of gymnastics or physical training, so as to 
strengthen the body, accustom the youth to endure fatigue, expand the 
chest, make the body obedient to his will; all this will act as a disci-

plinary force and aid in making good soldiers when the time comes for 
entering the army. 
The first national congress for the study of the subject of manual 
training was held in Ripatransone in September, 1889, and that city (in 
the Picine territory, 30 or 40 miles south of Ancona) is now recognized 
as the center for the diffusion of manual training throughout Italy, as 
the school established there is a summer normal school for manual 
training. The gradual ingrafting of this phase of education upon the 
school system of Italy may be best understood by extracts from a letter 
of Professor Paroli to the teachers of Italy, which appeared as the pre- 
face to “Principi Fondamentali del Lavoro Manuale Educativo” (the 
Italian edition of Otto Salomon’s lectures on manual training). First 
it may be stated that in 1887 the Italian Government sent 16 male 
teachers to Niiiis, in Sweden, to study in the summer manual training 
course there, and the result of their study was to interest prominent 
men of Italy in the subject of sloyd. 
Professor Paroli says: 
In our own country the work of Herr Salomon has found many imitators, who 
have been more courageous and intelligent than fortunate. Professor Tegon at 
Rome, the coadjutor of Pastorello, Borgna at Turin, Frascara at Genoa, Professor 
Pasquali at Brescia and Assizi, Professor Consorti, at first with Sutto and Pastorello, 
afterwards with Pasquali at Ripatransone, have started experiments which, when 
completed, will be attended with good results. But some maintain that these experi- 
ments have not yet produced the true manual scholastic work—i. e., the work that 
might bo taught in our elementary schools with brilliant results, judged from the 
didactic, educational, and hygienic point of view. I donot attempt to pronounce 
judgment, the more so because I have not been able to compare with my own eyes 
the results of the various experiments that I have mentioned above. But from what 
I have been able to see and from what has been told me I believe that in each of 
these attempts there has been a satisfactory harvest of practical results. 
The minister of public instruction has therefore decided to give a certain stimulus 
to fresh efforts, by arranging for a number of teachers from the royal normal schools 
to go and attend the autumn courses held at Ripatransone, which has now become 
the center of the movement for tho diffusion of manual instruction in our country. 
‘We may therefore expect that the experiment will continue, being sure that when 
these new masters know how to give manual instruction according to precise rules, 
it will, without further delay, form part of the curriculum of our elementary schools, 
which will then, and then only, have acquired the character of national schools, or 
schools for the people. During the last few years, too, a new branch of scholastic 
literature has been started amongst us—that which treats especially of manual 
instruction. In this branch the publications of Gabelli, Villari, and Latino cer- 
tainly occupy the first place, but the accounts that Professors Pick, Tegon, Gabrielli, 
Borgna, and others have published on the work of the Italian commission are also 
worth perusal. And worthy of mention, too, are the works of Professors Goldfarelli, 
Pastorello, Pasquali, and others on the important subject of educational work. A 
monthly journal, 11 Lavoro Manuale, has been published for some time at Milan, but 
the efforts of its manager and editor have not met, amongst the Italian scholastic 
public, with the favor they have deserved—an evident sign that the subject is for 
the most part premature. 
I do not venture to ask myself what reception the scholastic public will give the 
work of Herr Salomon. I conjecture that it will at least be discussed and that from

this discussion the champions of manual work, who are not wanting even in Italy, 
if they take advantage of it will come out strengthened and will sce an increase 
of their forces, which at present, however courageous they may be, are scanty in 
mumibers. * * *1   
The present minister of public instruction, Comm. Guido Baceelli, is 
so much interested in manual training as an educative force that he 
has offered prizes to those teachers who introduce it into their schools 
and has made it an obligatory study in the practice department of the 
normal schools. Detailed statistics are to be required at close of the 
year. Two hours a week must be devoted to this study. The normal 
course” at Ripatransone opens on August 28 and closes on September 
27. The regular programme includes (a) Froebelian exercise and exer- 
cises preparatory to feminine handiwork; (b) complete course in card- 
board work as applied to elementary geometry; (c) course in potters’ 
clay work; (d) zinc and iron work; (e) work in wood. In 1893 there 
were 34 men and 34 women teachers frequenting the course. Several of 
these teachers received Government subsidies to aid them in the study 
of manual training, but 7men and 27 women teachers paid their own 
expenses rather than not to have the training. The men devote forty- 
five hours a week to manual-training work (twelve for wood, twelve for 
iron, twelve for paper, and nine for clay work); the women forty-two 
hours a week (twelve for Froebel exercises, twelve for feminizie handi- 
work, nine for geometic work in cardboard, and nine for clay work). 
Examinations are held on September 23 and 24, and on September 25 
and 26 there is a public exhibition of the objects completed in the 
course; these number from 160 to 120 for each man teacher, and from 
120 to 150 for each woman teacher. Representations of the success of 
this work are made by the director to the minister of public instruc- 
tion. The director requests continued subsidies to teachers, and also 
to district inspectors, so that they may interest themselves in having 
manual training introduced into the elementary schools of their dis- 
tricts. He also suggests the beginning of a library for manual-training 
literature. 
Several times within the last ten or fifteen years projects have been 
formed combining Italian teachers in some sort of general association. 
To promote this end a congress was summoned to meet at Milan on the 
3d of September, 1894, The meeting, presided over by Professor Rho, 
of Turin, was attended by about 500 men and women teachers. It was 
decided that complete organization could only be obtained by means of 
district federation, and a vote was passed in favor of the immediate 
formation of Lombardian Federation. A committee of 6 was nomi- 
nated to draft a constitution of a great national federation of all 
teachers to be presented at the next Italian teachers’ association. Later 
developments will be watched with interest.

A decree of Minister Baccelli, dated September 5, 1894, in favor of 
pedagogical conferences, ordered the holding of ten-day sessions—Sep- 
tember 20 to 30—in the cities of Bari, Bologna, Brescia, Cagliari, 
Florence, Genoa, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Turin, and Venice. All 
teachers and officials connected with elementary education were 
expected to be present at the discussions to be held publicly. Aca- 
demic discourses are not to be held, but opportunities are to be given 
to the majority of those present to enter upon a discussion of questions 
of general educational interest. 
A congress (the third) of “Ricreatori” was held in Genoa in 1894, 
which body has for its object the study of the best means of amelio- 
rating the condition of the masses, the “ Ricreatori” to be an ally of the 
school, and to form a link between the home and school. 
A congress of educators was held in Rome, September 21 to 23, 1895, 
the day after the anniversary of the entrance of the troops into Rome. 
The resolutions adopted were that “the elementary schools be made 
dependent on the State; that obligatory instruction be extended to 12 
years of age, and thatthe instruction include the whole elementary school 
programme; that all children of public and private schools be obliged to 
pass a public examination; that the law regarding children at work in 
factories be carried out, as far as it appertains to obligatory instruction, 
under penalty of fines imposed on employers; that.a continuation school 
be established either for Sundays or evenings to prepare young people 
for civil life who have passed the obligatory school age, and that they be 
obliged to remain in it until the twentieth year of age; that instruction 
have a scientific basis and be given according to natural methods; that 
in religion the schools be absolutely neutral; that patriotism be incul- 
eated; that the school programme be so reformed as to make the 
teaching of history a central point toward civic education; that the 
hours of study be made uniform in all schools; that people’s libraries be 
established everywhere, so that there may be an extension of the study 
of national history and other useful knowledge; that the moral and 
material conditions of teachers be ameliorated, and the minimum of 
salary be 1,200 francs ($232); that no difference be made in salary 
given to teachers of upper or lower classes between men and women.” 
In the early part of 1895 an international congress for children was 
to be held in Florence. The questions to be discussed were the advance- 
ment of the physical, moral, and mental condition of children, the care 
of deaf, dumb, and blind children until they are old enough to enter an 
institution, the care of poor, abandoned children, and the establishment 
of children’s hospitals.

MEMORABLE DATES. 
The territory known to-day as Italy has been subjected to the domi- 
nation of Spain, France, and Austria at different periods of its history. 
Spanish rule predominated during the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- 
turies; Austrian at the beginning of the eighteenth; the French vic- 
tories changed the Government between 1797 and 1814; Austrian rule 
was reestablished in 1814. In 1848 the Milanese and Venetians joined 
Piedmont; in 1859 the Austrians lost their hold, and the Kingdom of 
Italy, comprising Piedmont, Sardinia, Lombardy, Tuscany, Modena, 
Parma, the Romagna, Naples, and Sicily, was formed. In 1866 Venetia 
was ceded to Italy by Austria, and the kingdom was consummated, 
with Rome as it capital, in 1870. 
In the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance Italy was the most 
brilliant center of literature and art in Europe. From the sixteenth 
to the eighteenth century, however, popular education—if one excepts 
a few celebrated institutions—was not greatly developed. The minis- 
ters and princes of the eighteenth century, animated with a spirit of 
reform, opened schools, notably the Emperor Joseph II, in Lombardy, 
by edict of 1786. During the period 1797-1814, when political affairs 
brought Italy and France more closely together, the obligation of main- 
taining elementary schools was imposed upon the communes of the 
Cisalpine Republic (1802) and the Kingdom of Naples. The fall of the
-P-A-G-E-638
    580 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95, 
French Empire paralyzed educational efforts. Later, liberal ideas 
inspired the law of 1819 in the Neapolitan realm, the school regulations 
of 1818 in the Lombard-Venetian Kingdom, the decree of 1822 in the 
Sardinian States, which required each commune to maintain a gratuit- 
ous elementary school. The most memorable dates from the educational 
standpoint are the following: 
1729 and 1772. Establishment of famous royal constitutions by princes of the House 
of Savoy through which the control of secondary education was taken away 
from the religious orders, and the Collegio delle Province, with one hundred 
free scholarships, was established with the aim of preparing, in connection 
with the university, teachers qualified to give this instruction. Schools of 
methods were established to prepare teachers for primary schools, and with 
the title of Magistrato della Riforma the germ of a well-organized council of 
public instruction appeared. 
1786. Reorganization of rural schools in Lombardy, the decree stipulating for free 
schools for the poor. 
1802. Sub-Alpine republics decreed that all communes should establish elementary 
schools. ‘ 
1808. Schools reorganized in parts of Italy under French domination. Academies 
established at Turin, Genoa, and Pisa as integral parts of the University of 
France. 
1813. Reorganization of public instruction in Rome. 
1818. New school law promulgated in the Lombardian-Venetian Kingdom which in 
1822 became the code of education for that part of Italy. 
1844. Establishment of ‘‘Asilid’ Infancia” (infant schools) in Piedmont, which were 
the beginning of the well-organized school system. 
1847. (Decree of November 30.) Office of minister of public instruction created. 
1849. Establishment of ‘‘ Societa d@’Istruziono e d’Educazione” in Lombardy-Venetia, 
which has been of great assistance in the organization of the present public 
school system. 
1859. Promulgation of the “Legge Casati,” or school law, named from the minister of 
public instruction at that date, which forms the basis of the present school 
system, as it provided that each commune should maintain an elementary 
school, that teachers should have certificates of capacity, that there be greater 
strictness in university examinations, ete. 
1867. Religious corporations abolished and their schools classed as private. Other 
modifications of law of 1859 made. 
1877. Instruction made obligatory for children between 6 and 9 years of age. 
1878. Gymnastics placed on school programmes. 
1881. Legal enactments reorganizing higher council of education and making 
changes in school supervision. 
1885 and 1886. Legal enactments bearing upon teachers’ salaries and teachers’ 
licenses. 
1887-1894. Reform movements in university cducation presented from year to year 
with intention of strengthening the larger university centers and abolishing 
others; commissions appointed to study subjects of physical education, text- 
books, reform in elementary school programmes, ctc. The “licenza ele- 
mentare” was introduced in 1882, abrogated by Minister Villari in 1891, and 
reintroduced by Minister Baccelli in 1894. The minister of publicinstruction 
has revived his former scheme for bringing primary and secondary schools 
into relation with each other. Boys who have reached the fifth class of a 
primary school and can pass a qualifying examination receive a certificate 
which allows them to enter a secondary school without further difficulty. 
The “licenza liceale” is to be conferred, from 1894 on, upon students of 
“ginnasi” and “licei” who have successfully passed the required exami- 
nations,

CONSTITUTION AND PURPOSE OF THE COMMISSION. 
As regards England, the event of most importance in educational 
circles is the publication of the report of the royal commission on sec- 
ondary education. The commission was appointed in March, 1894, 
and has accomplished its work with unusual dispatch. One hundred 
sessions were held, 85 witnesses examined (besides a great number of 
returns), and the report was ready to be submitted to Government in 
August, 1895. All educational interests—the universities, secondary 
schools, private and endowed elementary schools, school boards, teach- 
ers’ associations, etc.—were represented in the membership.! More- 
  
1The members were as follows: Mr. James Bryce, chairman; Sir John Hibbert, 
secretary to the treasury; Hon. Edward Lyttelton, M. A.; Sir Henry Enfield Ros- 
coe, D. C. L.; Dr. Edward Craig Maclure, D. D.; Andrew Martin Fairbairn, D. D.; 
Prof. Jebb. Litt, D. D., C. L.; Dr. Wormell, D. Sc.; Mr. Henry Hobhouse, M. A.; 
Mr. M. E. Sadler, M. A.; Mr. H. Llewellyn Smith, M. A.; Mr. M. G. Cockburn, 
chairman of the Leeds school board; Mr. C. Fenwick, Mr. James Henry Foxall, 
Lady Frederick Cavendish, Mrs. Sophie Bryant, D. Se.; Mrs. Eleanor Mildred 
Sidgwick.

over, it was distinguished from all preceding commissions by the pres- 
ence of women. The royal commission is the third appointed to deal 
with secondary education since 1860, at which time the Government 
began to turn its attention seriously to the subject. The necessity for 
the commission arose from conditions that are inherent in the educa- 
tional policy of Great Britain—first, a multiplicity of unrelated agencies 
with consequent overlapping and waste of resources; second, unequal 
distribution of schools and, more especially, inadequate provision for 
the secondary education of the poorer classes. This confusion and 
inequality, corrected in some directions by legislation growing out of 
therecommendations of the commission of 1864, has been aggravated 
in others by impulses from the same source.! The commission was 
charged to devise measures for overcoming these evils. In the lan- 
guage of their order, they were— 
to consider what are the best methods of establishing a well-organized system of 
secondary education in England, taking into account existing deficiencies and 
having regard to such Jocal sources of revenue from endowment or otherwise as are 
available or may be made available or may be made for this purpose, and to make 
recommendations accordingly. 
The persons examined by the commission represented all the various 
agencies and the clashing interests affected by the inquiry, together 
with a fair number of impartial but experienced witnesses; the digests 
of evidence appended? give a graphic picture of the peculiar complica- 
tions with which the commission had to deal; their own report, with 
the recommendations, illustrates in a very striking manner the tradi- 
tional conservatism of English policy. 
PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION. 
The immediate outcome of the labors of the commission is found in 
their recommendations. While discussing incidentally phases of sec- 
ondary education not distinctly named in their instructions, they kept 
always in view the specific purpose of their mission, and their recom- 
mendations, presented under five heads and comprising 160 proposi- 
tions, all relate cither to organization or to the means of increasing the 
provision or efficiency of secondary instruction. 
Three distinct departures from the present policy are involved in 
these recommendations. Two of these pertain to organizing authori- 
ties, the third to the efficiency of instruction. Briefly stated, these are: 
(1) The recommendation to create a ministry of education, i. ¢., “a 
department of the executive government, presided over by a minister 
responsible to Parliament, who would obviously be the same minister 
as the one to whom the charge of elementary education is intrusted ;”* 
(2) the constitution of a new local authority for secondary education;

*Report of commission, vol.1, p. 257.
-P-A-G-E-643
  THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 585 
(3) a scheme for the registration of teachers applicable to teachers of 
all classes. 
While these measures are departures, they make no violent break 
with the past; they are one and all in the line of recommendations 
made by the commission of 1864,! and have been formally proposed to 
Parliament from time to time, notably the proposition for a ministry of 
education, which seemed very near realization during Mr. Mundella’s 
administration of the department of education. 
The central authority.—If constituted in the manner recommended, 
the ministry would be simply an expansion of the education depart- 
ment, with absorption of the science and art department and a transfer 
from the charity commission of the duty of dealing with educational 
endowments controlled by the law of 1869. 
The minister would be assisted by a permanent secretary familiar 
with all the details of the system. Little direct executive power would 
be entrusted to the central authority; its function would not be “to 
control, but rather to supervise,” not to override or supersede local 
action, but to bring about “harmony and cooperation” among the vari- 
ous local agencies. With respect to the constitution of local bodies, 
the revisions of schemes for endowed schools, the location of new 
schools, the conduct of examinations and inspection, and in general in 
questions of dispute between local authorities, the central body would 
have large advisory and judicial scope. It would moreover have gen- 
eral control of all State funds for education and of nonlocal endowed 
schools and power to constrain local authorities to make due provision 
for secondary education. 
The need of professional advice in respect to nearly all the questions 
which would come before the minister is distinctly recognized, and is 
met by an educational council somewhat similar to the French superior 
council of public instruction. In recommending this feature the com- 
missioners observe: 
There will be some matters, however, in which the counsel of persons specially 
conversant with education and holding an independent position may be so helpful, 
and there will be some duties in their nature so distinctly judicial rather than 
executive, as to make it desirable to secure for the minister the advice of persons not 
under his official direction. There will, moreover, be some work to be done ina 
central educational department so purely professional as to belong rather to an inde- 
pendent body than to a department of state. For these purposes we propose that 
there be created an educational council which may advise the minister in the first- 
mentioned class of matters and in appeals, while such a professional function as the 
registration of teachers might be entirely committed to it.? 
The council would be much smaller than the French council (12 mem- 
bers as against 60), the same to be appointed or chosen as follows: 
One-third appointed by the Crown, one-third by the four universities of Oxford, 
Cambridge, London, and Victoria (1 member by each), and one-third selected by the

rest.of the council from among experienced members of the teaching profession. 
The term of office is put at six years, and arrangements ought to be made which 
would prevent all the members from going out of office at the same time, so as to 
secure the continuance and transmission of experience and a certain permanence of 
policy. 
THE NEW LOCAL AUTHORITY. 
The question of organizing and unifying local authorities was much 
more intricate than that of the constitution of a central authority. 
Existing agencies having vested interests and charter rights could not 
be ignored; jealousies and opposition were sure to be stirred up what- 
ever new agency might be proposed. Two public representative bodies 
are already in the field, one the elected school boards, whose function 
is purely educational; the other, the county and county borough coun- 
cils, created by the local government act of 1888. The former, although 
legally confined to elementary education, have brought about an 
“extension of the parliamentary grant to higher grades,” in fact have 
shown their ability to organize high schools. In rural districts, how- 
ever, school boards are not at present available. As determined by 
the education law of 1870, the district for the election of a board 
(except in the metropolis) is either (1) a municipal borough or (2) a 
eivil parish. The population with which a school board deals varies 
anywhere from less than 250 to 5,000 and upward. Fully 23 per cent 
of the districts, chiefly rural, comprising nearly one-third of the total 
population, have had no election of boards. It is in the great commer- 
cial and manufacturing centers that their influence has been powerful. 
The county and county boroughs are permanent administrative areas 
recently created to avoid just such complications in other civil affairs 
as are now embarrassing education. In accordance with the local goy- 
ernment act of 1888, England and Wales were divided into 60 admin- 
istrative counties and 61 county boroughs, having each more than 
50,000 inhabitants. These, with the county of London, which was 
treated distinctly, made 122 new areas for local self-government. The 
supreme authority in each area is a council elected every three years. 
The right to levy a rate of a penny in the pound for technical educa- 
tion, conferred upon the councils by a law of 1889, and the act of the 
following year placing at the disposal of the councils the surplus of the 
duties on spirits, about $3,000,000 annually, with the privilege of apply- 
ing the same to education, made the councils the chief public agents 
for fostering secondary education. In the boroughs they are not more 
powerful than the school boards; their supremacy is in the rural areas. 
So much is necessary to understand the sense in which the new 
agency recommended by the commissioners is simply a compromise. 
According to the recommendation there would be “a new local author- 
ity for secondary education in every county and in every county 
borough, that is to say, speaking generally, in boroughs with a popula- 
tion exceeding 50,000.” This body, which for convenience may be

termed a county or a county borough board, would comprise not less 
than 14 nor more than 42 members. The composite character of the 
boards is illustrated in the typical cases presented in the report: 
Taking 28 as the number for one of the larger counties, the body would be formed 
somewhat as follows: 
Chosen by the county council 
Chosen by the central office . 
Co-opted by the above. 
and of the 12 not aed by the county council several ought to be taken ee per- 
sons actually or recently engaged in teaching. . 
Members appointed by a county council ought to hold office for the term of office 
of the council; other members for a term of five years. 
     
The county borough authority, comprising from 12 to 24 members, 
would be formed as follows: 
The borough council and the school board should each appoint one-third of the 
members, being free to select those persons either from within or from without its 
own body. Of the remaining one-third of the members, one-half, or one-sixth of the 
whole, ought to be nominated by the central office after communication with any 
university or university college or colleges which may be situate sufficiently near 
the borough or may otherwise be so connected with it as to be capable of influ- 
encing its education. Should the borough, however, contain a university college, 
this one-sixth of the whole might be left to be appointed directly by that college. 
The other one-sixth of the whole ought to be co-opted by those previously chosen, 
The commissioners add: 
Here, as in the case of the county authority, we think that the power of co-opta- 
tion and that of appointment by the central office may fitly be required to be used 
so as to secure for the local authority the benefit of that special experience which 
teachers possess. 
Members appointed by the borough council ought to hold office for three years; 
those appointed by the school board for the term of the board that appointed them; 
other members for five years. 
On account of the important agencies already operating in London, 
a special constitution of the local authority is recommended as follows:

  Here again the commissioners emphasize the importance of having 
the teaching profession well represented, and, further, that a certain 
number of the members “be selected from among persons possessing 
special knowledge of London industries, whether as employers or as 
workmen.”!

It is significant that the commissioners specially urge the appoint- 
ment of women on these local boards. They say: 
We think that women ought to be eligible for appointment (whether by a public 
authority or by cooptation) upon both sets of authorities, and that it is, indeed, desir- 
able to provide that a certain number shall be women, as experience seems to have 
shown that the interests of girls often receive insufficient attention, and that there 
is also a risk that women may not be chosen unless some special provision for their 
presence be made.! 
The functions of the new local authorities, as briefly epitomized by 
the commissioners, would be— 
(1) The securing a due provision of secondary instruction. 
(2) The remodeling, where necessary, and supervision of the working of endowed 
(other than nonlocal) schools and other educational endowments.? 
(3) A watchful survey of the field of secondary education, with the object of 
bringing proprietary and private schools into the general educational system, and 
of endeavoring to eneourage and facilitate, so far as this can be done, by stimulus, 
by persuasion, and by the offer of privileges and advice, any improvements they 
may be inclined to introduce. 
(4) The administration of such sums, either arising from rates levied within its 
area or paid over from the national exchequer, as may be at its disposal for the 
promotion of education. 
None of these functions, however, is to be arbitrarily exercised. 
While on the one hand the local authority will be constrained by the 
central to see to it that the provision of secondary instruction in its 
area is sufficient, on the other, its measures, whether for the remodel- 
ing of old schools or the creation of new, will be subject to the revision 
of the central authority. The endowed or publicly supported schools 
which come under the jurisdiction of the local authority will remain 
under the immediate charge of their own administrative bodies, and 
although any local authority giving aid to such schools is entitled to 
representation on the governing body, the representation will be care- 
fully limited. 
The endowments with which the local authority may deal yield 
about £830,000 annually for education—the proceeds from the duties 
on spirits, about £748,000, to which would be added £650,000 if the 
local authority universally exercised its right to levy an education 
tax. This would give a sum of about $10,750,000. This power of the 
purse would not be unlimited, as the accounts of the local authority 
are “to be annually audited by some person appointed by.a depart- 
ment of Government.” 
It should be noted that the seven‘ great public schools of England 
are not included in the educational endowments with which the local 
authority would deal. These, however, would be brought within the

scheme for coordinating secondary schools through the supervisory 
powers conferred upon the central authority. 
Provision is made for bringing private schools under the general 
supervision of the local authority by extending to them “the benefit 
of public examinations and of scholarships and other auxiliary funds 
supplied from public sources, in return for which they would be 
expected to submit to a certain amount of public supervision.” More- 
over, in respect to a matter intimately concerning the public welfare— 
sanitary inspection—the commissioners recommend that the local 
authority be empowered to cause all schools, whether endowed (or in 
any other sense public), proprietary, or private, within its area to be 
inspected as respects the sanitary condition of their buildings and 
class rooms, and to require them to conform to such general regula- 
tions for securing health as may be issued by the central office, which, 
in case of refusal to so conform, should have power to direct any 
insanitary school buildings to be no longer used for school purposes, 
subject, however, to an appeal on the part of the owner or occupier of 
such buildings to the central office.’ 
THE REGISTRATION OF TEACHERS. 
The cautious treatment of the province of local authorities is in 
striking contrast to the decided policy advocated by the commissioners 
in respect to the registration of teachers. Here they have gone directly 
against the narrow prejudices which have isolated elementary educa- 
tion from the higher grades. They stand for the unification of all 
scholastic work and the placing of all teaching on a distinctly profes- 
sional basis. 
Their proposition is simple, namely, that there shall be one register, 
open alike to all teachers, from a private governess toa head master, 
provided they fulfill the required conditions. These are: (1) A degree, 
or a certificate of general attamments, granted by some university or 
body recognized for that purpose by the registration authority and 
accepted as satisfactory by that authority; and (2) a certificate or 
diploma of adequate knowledge of the theory and practice of educa- 
tion granted by a university or body recognized as above;? that is, 
scholarly attainment and professional training. 
In elaborating their views they make it clear that they have second- 
ary teachers chiefly in mind; for instance, they propose to relax the 
severity of the admission standard in the case of ‘persons who have 
been engaged in teaching in secondary schools for three years before 
the passing of the act who produce to the educational council satisfac- 
tory evidence of intellectual acquirements and competence to teach.” 
And again they advise “that, after the lapse of a reasonable time—say, 
seven years after the establishment of the register—no unregistered 
  
‘Vol. 1, p. 278. 2Vol. 1, p. 319. sTbid., p. 320.
-P-A-G-E-648
    590 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
person should be allowed to be appointed as a teacher of a public sec- 
ondary school or of a school recognized by the local authority as con- 
tributing to the supply of efficient secondary education.”! 
There is nothing, however, to exclude elementary teachers from the 
register, and the proposition as it stands is regarded as a victory for 
that class. The National Association of Elementary Teachers has long 
contended for such a measure, and before the commission their repre- 
sentatives urged it with great and evidently convincing force. We 
may trace also an influence from the elementary system in the commis- 
sioners’ demand that teachers shall have professional training. While 
not committing themselves to any particular policy in this respect, they 
evidently regard the universities as the proper centers for this work. 
As regards general education they say, unreservedly, teachers “ will 
obtain it, and in our view ought to obtain it, not in special seminaries, 
put in the same schools and universities as are resorted to by persons 
desiring to enter the other professions.”” 
As regards professional training, which the commissioners hold should 
include “both a theoretical and a practical side,” they would not intrust 
the provision to “local authorities, because their sphere of action is not 
sufficiently wide,” nor, on the other hand, “to the central office, because 
that might induce an undesirable uniformity,” but in the interests of 
freedom and variety would urge the universities “to take up the task, 
as has been done in two Scottish universities, and very recently in 
Durham.” They add: “If the science of education is to make good the 
claims put forward on its behalf, it ought to be studied where other 
branches of mental and moral philosophy are fully handled by the 
ablest professors. In speaking of universities we include the leading 
university colleges.”* 
The dignity, independence, and uniformly high standard of the regis- 
tration is secured by committing it wholly to the educational council.‘ 
ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS. 
The most important question before the Commission was that of 
extending the provision of secondary education. This is indeed the 
purpose in view in the creation of new organizing authorities, and it is 
evidently the sense of the commission that the actual means of accom- 
plishing the end desired must be left to the judgment of these authori- 
ties exercised in view of particular circumstances. However, under 
the general head of “Arrangements for the better organization of 
schools,” the commissioners deal more directly with the problem of 
increasing both the efficiency and the quantity of secondary instruction. 
For a complete understanding of the recommendations under this 
head it would be necessary to consider the constitution of existing 
schools more fully than is here desirable. I shall, therefore, note only 
certain suggestions or opinions of very general interest.

MEANS OF INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY AND EXTENDING THE 
PROVINCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Service of inspection and examination.—In discussing the functions 
of the new local authorities the commissioners specify in particular 
the maintenance of a service of inspection. 
It will be desirable [they say] that the central office should issue a list of persons 
qualified by professional experience or otherwise specially competent to act as 
inspectors, and that local authorities, who may often with advantage combine for 
this purpose, should either sclect from this list those whose services they need or 
from time to time may submit to the central office for its approval the name of some 
other person whom they wish to be permitted to employ. As in our view it is better 
that the power of inspection should rest with the local rather than with any central 
authority, we conceive that it is by the local authority the inspector should be 
chosen, though the difficulty such an authority may experience in finding fit men 
points to the formation of such a list as we have suggested. 
They are particular also to make it clear that the inspection contem- 
plated is something different— 
from the inspection maintained in the elementary schools. All that they deem nec- 
essary for the local authority to secure is a report from a competent hand upon the 
general condition and equipment of each school, including particularly the number 
and qualifications of the teaching staff.1 * * * 
Returning again to this subject when discussing the actual organiza- 
tion of schools, the commission observes further: 
In selecting persons for these posts great weight ought to be given to previous 
experience in teaching; and duly qualified women should be chosen where there is 
likely to be sufficient work for them. The appointment of such inspectors should, we 
think, be made independent of any limit of age. This rule, which is contrary to the 
present practice of the education department, would often enable the local author- 
ity to secure a man of greater educational experience than can be done under the 
present system. The local authority should have power to appoint a separate 
inspector to conduct the sanitary inspection if they prefer so todo. * * * 
Where there is a scheme [for carrying out tho terms of an endowment] the 
inspector should see that its various requirements as to the constitution and meet- 
ings of the governing body, the keeping of accounts, scholarships, examinations, 
etc., have been duly complied with. He should also in all cases require the pro- 
duction of the school time-table, and see that it sufficiently provides for instruction 
in the subjects of the curriculum as presented by the scheme. He should satisfy 
himself that the teaching staff of the school is sufficient both in number and attain- 
ments for the work that it claims to do, and that the equipment and apparatus 
are suitable and sufficient. It would further be desirable that he should also be 
present at the teaching of, at any rate, the principal classes, so as to form a just 
appreciation of the practical qualifications of the teachers, without in any way 
interfering with the course of instruction given.® 
With respect to the last point, the commissioners are careful to add: 
In view of the disquiet which a general enforcement of such a rule might at first 
excite, we are not prepared to say that this should be deemed essential.+

  592 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Examination is treated as a separate service. 
Each school or a certain portion of the scholars, the commissioners urge, should 
be annually examined by some independent and competent person, but this may 
under proper regulations (to be framed by the central office) be allowed to be done 
at the instance of the schools themselves. 
It is of interest to note in this connection that in respect to the 
means of determining the efficiency of secondary schools the commis- 
sion sought to profit by the experience of other countries. From 
France and Germany, in particular, memoranda were obtained setting 
forth very fully their policies in this respect. The measures finally 
recommended by the commissioners, however, show little tendency to 
copy from these, and are evidently framed with a careful regard to the 
independence and individuality which is the pride of English secondary 
schools. 
Classification and curricula of schools.—Coming directly to the sub- 
ject of school provision, the commission consider first the classification 
of secondary schools. According to English ideals this is inextricably 
involved with differences of curricula arising from the different social 
conditions of students. So far from recommending a uniform course 
upon which all secondary students should enter, the commission recog- 
nize the necessity of distinguishing between students of the “humble 
stratum, who must leave school at about 14 years to earn their living 
in shops or warehouses, or in some industrial oceupation;” “those who 
will remain till about 16 and then enter upon professional courses or 
the higher walks of communal life,” and those who remain till about 
18 years of age and are likely then to enter the universities.. In this 
classification they follow, although with confessed reluctance, the lines 
laid down by the commission of 1864.1 As regards the actual curricula 
for these three types, under a due regard for the traditional independ- 
ence of English headmasters they refrain from any explicit instruec- 
tions. Their general conception of the scope of secondary studies is 
expressed as follows: 
It is agreed— 
That besides that literary and humanistic course of instruction, based upon the 
languages of classical antiquity which tradition has established among us, and 
whose incomparable value no thoughtful man denies, ample provision must be made 
in schools for scientific teaching, beginning if possible with natural history and 
the other sciences of observation and working up into chemistry and physics. It is 
further agreed that mathematics, wlrile more closely allied to scientific subjects, 
ought to enter also into a literary course; that the chief tongues of modern Europe 
ought to be studied, not only as instruments of linguistic training but as the keys 
to noble literatures; and that full opportunities to boys and girls to prepare them- 
selves for the particular occupations which they intend to follow in after life, 
whether industrial or commercial, ought to be supplied by the teaching of the prac- 
tical arts, such as the elements of applied mechanics and the subjects connected 
with agriculture, as well as of modern languages and of the kinds of knowledge 
most useful to the merchant or trader. These three elements, however, which we 
  
  
1Vol. 1, pp. 282, 283.
-P-A-G-E-651
. THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 593 
may call the literary, the scientific, and the technical, may be combined in a great 
variety of forms and proportions. Experience alone can show which forms and 
which proportions are most likely to be absolutely best—we will not say as a scheme 
of intellectual training, but even as fitted to the needs of particular classes of per- 
sons inhabiting particular areas and engaged in particular kinds of industry. * * * 
Each of the three elements above named has vigorous forces bchindit. Not merely 
tradition, but the influences of imagination and philosophy commend the first. The 
second is strong in the pride of its recent triumphs and still swift advance. The 
sense of its practical utility in days when industrial and commercial competition 
grows constantly more severe is enough, perhaps more than cnongh, to secure its 
rightful place for the third. All have in one view a claim to be considered in the 
course of studies of every secondary school, and the last of the three will thrive all 
the better if the two former receive their fitting mecd of recognition. Technical 
instruction must be considered not as the rival of a liberal education, but as a spe- 
cialization of it, which, whether it comes carlier or later in the scholar’s life, ought 
to be as far as possible made a means of mental stimulus and cultivation, and will be 
most successfully used by those whose intellectual capacity has been already disci- 
plined by the best methods of literary or scientific training.! 
Coeducation.—The question of coeducation was very thoroughly ex- 
amined by the commission, with the result that they advocate its further 
extension. Many difficulties of organization, they say, : 
  may be obviated, especially where the number of pupils in a school or a department 
of a school is comparatively small, and some educational advantages secured by 
establishing schools in which boys and girls are educated together. This system 
has been tried with so much success in other countries, and to some extent in Great 
Britain itself, that we feel sure its use may be extended without fear of any unde- 
sirable consequences and probably with some special advantages for the formation 
of character and general stimulus to intellectual activity. Such a school may be 
organized either as a mixed school, the boys and girls being taught in the same classes 
throughout, or as a so-called ‘“‘dual” school, having two distinct departments, but 
with a common staff and arrangements under which some subjects are taught to 
both sexes together.? 
And again: 
Some difficulty will no doubt arise in making adequate provision for the secondary 
instruction of girls in rural districts, owing to the fact that in many places the 
number of pupils to be looked for will not be sufficient to justify the creation of a 
separate girls’ department either in an existing endowed school or in a secondary 
department to be attached to an elementary school. In these cases we think that 
the same school or department ought to receive both boys and girls, and the evidence 
we have received leads us to believe that this may safely and properly be done. We 
conceived that the duty and the interest of the community require equal provision 
to be made for both sexes, and although care may be needed in the conduct of the 
requisite arrangements, especially at starting, we are persuaded that the objections 
to a system of coeducation are slighter than those which would apply either to feeble 
separate departments or to a neglect of the needs of girls in cases where their number 
might be comparatively small. 
Religious instruction.—The absence of any recommendation touchiug 
religious instruction is particularly noticeable at this time, when excite- 
ment over the subject as related to elementary schools is intense. It is 
significant that according to the commissioners the religious difficulty 
1Pages 284, 285. 2Vol.1, p. 285. Page 297.
-P-A-G-E-652
  594 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
is “extremely rare” in English secondary education, and in avoiding 
the subject they are following the trend of educational legislation in 
England, which so far has been to “remove all just causes of offense or 
friction, and to secure as far as possible that differences of religious 
belief shall not unduly restrict the diffusion of educational benefits.”! 
Among the recommendations for improving the quality of secondary 
instruction not the least significant are the following relative to teach- 
ers’ salaries: 
In all public secondary schools we recommend the adoption of the provision usual 
in schemes under the endowed schools acts, that the salary of the head teacher shall 
be determined by scheme, and shall consist partly of a fixed yearly sum and partly 
of a capitation payment for cach scholar in the school, variable by the governors 
within certain limits. 
The method of fixing the salaries of assistant teachers should vary slightly accord- 
ing to the plan adopted for their appointment and dismissal, but the ultimate 
responsibility in the matter should rest with the governing body. Thus, where the 
appointment and dismissal arc in the hands of the governors, the salaries should be 
determined by them, though here also they should be required to consult the head 
teacher. Where the head teacher has the right, however limited, to appoint and 
dismiss, the governors should fix the aggregate yearly amount or proportion of the 
income of the school to be applied in payment of the assistants’ salaries, while the 
head teacher might, but always subject to the approval of the governors, determine 
the amount to be paid to each teacher. 
With respect to women teachers the commissioners advocate a much 
more liberal policy than has hitherto prevailed. On this point they 
submit that— 
Eyen when mistresses are as well qualified, academically and professionally, as 
masters, it nevertheless constantly happens that their standard of remuneration is 
fixed toolow. This has a depressing effect on the educational profession as well as 
on the schools themselves, and although the matter is one for which positive recom- 
mendations can hardly be made, we may express the hope that the authorities of 
schools will deal more liberally than has hitherto been often the case with women 
teachers, and that, in fixing the scale of fees and the proportion of endowments to 
be attributed to their salaries, regard will be had to the desirability of encouraging, 
both by good salaries and by prospects of promotion, the entrance of the most 
capable women into the work of teaching.? 
Provision for classes not at present reached by secondary schools.— 
Whatever advantage may result from the improvement of existing 
schools, it is evident that such measures alone will not suffice to extend 
the provision of secondary instruction to the classes now practically 
excluded from its benefits. 
It was believed in many quarters that the time had come for advo- 
cating a system of free secondary schools, supported and controlled by 
the public. The experience of many school boards seems to prove the 
feasibility of such a measure. But the golden opportunity, if such it 
was, has been thrown away by the commission; so far from recom- 
mending a free system of public high schools, they distinctly advise 
against providing free secondary education to the whole community.

  THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 595 
In place of a policy so democratic, they seek to devise means for ena- 
bling selected children of the poorer parents to climb the educational 
ladder. 
Scholarship funds.—This is to be accomplished by means of scholar- 
ship funds. These, in the judgment of the commission— 
should be of one or more of the following kinds, the kind to be determined, where 
the scholarships are founded by the local authority, at the discretion of that 
authority : 
(1) Some should be open to children being educated in the ordinary “standards” 
of public elementary schools within the local area, 
_ (2) Others should be awarded to children who are receiving their education at a 
so-called higher grade elementary school, or a secondary school (whether public or 
private) of a less advanced type than the school at which the scholarships are to be 
tenable. 
(3) Others again might be open to all children attending any schools within the 
area of the local authority, or whose parents reside or are employed within the 
area. 
(4) Insome localities it may also be advisable to have scholarships open to all 
children free from any restrictions as to school or residence, but subject to suitable 
conditions as to age and the means of the parents. 
It is especially recommended that— 
provision should everywhere be made for both boys and girls, and where the same 
scholarships are open to both sexes care should be taken that a fair proportion, 
with regard both to the number of candidates and the comparative excellence of 
their work, is awarded to each sex. 
As a rule the scholarships should be obtained by competitive exam- 
ination. In case of scholarships attached to a public elementary school 
the commissioners advise that they— 
be awarded either by competitive examinations held at the school, or, where this is 
considered undesirable on account of the tender age of the children or for other 
reasons, upon the joint recommendation of the head master and of the sehool board 
or school managers, to the scholars whose record of work is best for a series of 
school years or quarters, or by a combination of the two methods. 
The commissioners add: 
With respect to competitive examinations generally, we consider they should be 
restricted as far as possible to scholars above the age of 12, and that the examina- 
tion, if at all applied below that age, should be of a very simple character. Even 
where the scholarship examination is held for children of a more advanced age, it 
should, we consider, be restricted to a limited number of subjects, should include a 
considerable amount of viva voce questioning, and should be directed principally 
to ascertaining the general intelligence of the candidates rather than the extent of 
their acquired knowledge. The importance, however, of insisting on these condi- ~ 
tions, especially the two former, will tend to diminish as the ages of the candidates 
inerease, and if any rules can be framed under which weight coald be given to the 
health and physical condition of the candidates sufficient to avert the danger now 
sometimes felt of unduly pressing children forward and developing their brains at 
the expense of their bodies, the effect of such rules might be very salutary. We do 
not, however, think that this excellent object could be attained, as has sometimes 
been suggested, by allowing marks for proficiency in games, for that would induce 
another and not less m‘schievous kind of overpressure. 
 
-P-A-G-E-654
596 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
As to the value of scholarships, it is recommended that they— 
be of several different kinds, viz: (a) Those which cover the cost only of instruction, 
with or without traveling expenses; (b) those which cover the necessary cost of board 
and lodging, as well as of instruction; and (c) those which consist of an annual 
payment of a fixed amount, either exclusive or inclusive of free boarding. Special 
judgment and caution will of course be required in awarding those of the two 
latter classes. 
As the lack of secondary schools available for the poorer classes is 
one of the special evils which the commission was to remedy, it becomes 
necessary to limit the scholarships in some measure at least to those 
classes. This is to be done (1) by a provision augmenting the value of 
a scholarship according to the pecuniary circumstances of the holder, 
at the discretion of the local authority on the governing body of the 
school; (2) inquiry by the local authority into the circumstances of 
parents whose children are candidates for scholarships founded by 
local authority out of its own funds and intended for the children of 
poorer parents, 
Different tests of pecuniary circumstances [say the commissioners] should be 
applied for different classes of scholarships. Thus, e. g., free education in a third 
grade secondary day school may be somewhat freely given to children of the wage- 
earning class, or to those belonging to families of equally restricted means; whereas 
a higher line, such perhaps as that now drawn for abatements of income tax at 
incomes of £500 a year, may fairly be drawn, if the local authority approve, in the 
case of candidates secking aid from public sources to enable them to attend some 
place of higher education. 
Fear that scholarships intended for the poor should be monopolized by 
the well-to-dois not groundless. This has been the fate of many such 
funds in the past, and the need of guarding against it is emphasized 
by the commissioners. 
It has been brought to our notice [they say] that there are many scholarships of 
considerable value belonging to existing foundations, especially those of a nonlocal 
character, which are legally open to children of all classes. Some complaint has 
been made that the holders of these scholarships, having ceased to be deemed, as 
they once were, socially inferior to their schoolfellows, are now to a large extent 
drawn from the children of well-to-do parents, whose superior means have enabled 
them, by a special course of training at an expensive preparatory school, to secure 
the scholarship over the heads of their less fortunately situated competitors. We 
consider this practice, which tends to become more and more common, ought to be 
checked in the interests of public economy. But we do not think it would be either 
fair or wise to exclude altogether the children of well-to-do or even of wealthy parents 
from the laudable ambition of winning the distinction conferred by a scholarship, 
or from the right of sharing, together with other classes of the community, in the 
superior ional advantages often attaching to its possession. There are also, 
as we have pointed out elsewhere, grave objections to the present system on the 
ground of the unhealthy competition it induces and the disadvantages it imposes 
on the smaller and poorer schools. We therefore recommend that these scholarships 
should continue to be legally open to all classes, but should be restricted to a com- 
paratively low value, the governing body of the school being intrusted with a dis- 
eretion to augment their value in the case of any individual scholar if they should 
consider that such augmentation is required by the pecuniary circumstances of his

or her parents. Wo moreover consider that, in view of the difficulties in the way 
of individual schools carrying out such a reform by themselves, it should be required 
by a general statutory enactment.! 
Financial resources of secondary schools.—The difficulties in the way 
of securing an adequate supply of secondary schools, and more par- 
ticularly the uniform distribution of the provision, are brought to view 
in the attitude of the commission with respect to financial resources; 
virtually they leave this part of the problem where they found it, 
excepting so far as it is made to depend upon the will of the new local 
authority. 
The extent [say the commissioners] to which public opinion will encourage the 
local authorities we have recommended to establish new schools or to develop those 
which exist, and the amount of popular support they will receive if they show 
themselves forward in this work, can not be conjectured beforehand, and will 
doubtless differ materially in different parts of the country. So will the scale of 
expenditure which those local authorities may be disposed to adopt. So will the 
readiness of parents to pay a fair price for the instruction provided, and thereby to 
increase that part of the school revenue which fees may be expected tosupply. The 
possibility of turning endowments to better account, the prospect of making the 
various sums which are derived from the national exchequer go further than they do 
as now administered, the disposition of localities to rate themselves, are all of them 
matters more or less conjectural in any given district in the country, and still less 
capable of definite prediction as regards the whole country. We can not, therefore, 
undertake to establish an exact balance between probable income and probable 
expenditure. The most we can attempt is to present a view of the several funds 
now available, and to point out in what ways they may best be used so as to enable 
administration to be both economical and efficient. 
The several sources of income which will be under the charge of the 
local authority have been indicated in the foregoing survey; to reca- 
pitulate here, they are: Endowments subject to endowed schools acts 
(£735,000 gross), additional available endowments (£100,000), grant 
under the customs and excise act of 1890 (£748,000 in 1893-94), rates 
(£640,000 possible outcome), tuition fees, Parliamentary grants. The 
last two are unknown and variable quantities in the problem. With 
respect to fees, the commissioners advise “that as a rule, assuming the 
school to have its buildings found, and the expense of their mainte- 
nance not to be included in ‘cost price, the cost price ought to be 
taken as the standard.”” 
Number of secondary pupils.—The want of statistics as to the actual 
number of secondary students in England is not supplied by this 
report. The number of secondary students, boys and girls, in the 
endowed and proprietary schools of seven selected counties is given 
as 32,092, or 3.6 per 1,000 inhabitants.’ If this ratio prevailed over 
England and Wales, it would give a total of 108,200 secondary students 
in the classes of schools named. The ratio is greatly exceeded in

London, where the number of secondary students in public endowed 
and public proprietary schools is 26,179, or 6 to 1,000 inhabitants.! 
Private schools, it will be observed, are omitted in this view. A 
recent estimate by the president of the Association of Private School- 
masters gives 600,000 as the number of pupils under instruction in 
private schools. 
The fall bearing of the recommendations, here briefly summarized, 
which will certainly go far toward determining the future conduct of 
secondary education in England, can not be well understood apart from 
their historical antecedents. These are briefly outlined in the following 
extracts from the historical survey with which the commissioners pre- 
face their reports: : 
EXTRacts FROM THE HISTORICAL SKETCH. 
[Report of the Royal Commission, vol. 1, pp. 7-80.] 
Preceding commissions.—It was not until 1861 that what is now called secondary 
or intermediate education engaged the serious attention of the Government. “In 
that year a royal commission was appointed to inquire into the condition of 9 among 
the chief endowed schools of the country, viz., Eton, Winchester, Westminster, 
Charterhouse, St. Paul’s, Merchant Taylors, Harrow, Rugby, and Shrewsbury.” 
The report presented by this commission (1864) led to legislation ‘“‘ which intro- 
duced certain reforms in the administration of seven of the above schools which 
were nonlocal in their character, boarding for the most part as well as educating 
their pupils. The two excepted were day schools, drawing their scholars from Lon- 
don and its environs, viz., St. Paul’s and Merchant Taylors. This first commission on 
secondary education was followed by a second, with a much wider and more national 
reference. This was the royal commission appointed 28th December, 1864, to inquire 
into all the schools which had not been included either in the commission of 1861 or 
in the popular education commission of 1858.” * * * 
Its report, presented in 1867, and extending, with the appendices, to 20 volumes, 
throws a flood of light upon the whole subject, and it may be taken as a fitting 
point of departure from which to trace in outline the recent history of English 
secondary education. 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SCHOOLS INQUIRY COMMISSION. 
The chief recommendations of the schools inquiry commissioners fell under three 
heads. The first of these heads compared the reforms which the commissioners 
deemed needful for the better management of the revenues of endowed schools and 
for securing the efficiency of their teaching. The second head related to the consti- 
tution of the administrative authorities, which were intended to carry out the reforms 
suggested and to bring both public opinion and professional experience to bear upon. 
the development and working of a comprehensive educational system. Three such 
authorities were recommended—(1) a central authority, (2) a local or provincial 
authority, with a certain jurisdiction both in proposing schemes for the reform of 
endowed schools (the area being defined as a county or group of counties), and (3) a 
central council of education, charged with the duties of drawing up rules for the 
examination of schools and of appointing persons to conduct the examinations. 
Legislation growing out of the above recommendations.—Fourteen months after the 
presentation of this epoch-making report, Your Majesty’s then Government laid before 
Parliament a bill founded upon it, which, with some important changes, became law 
in the course of the session as ‘‘ The endowed schools act, 1869.” By this act a body 
  
1Vol. IX, table, p. 437.
-P-A-G-E-657
THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 599 
ealled the ‘Endowed schools commission ” was established, with powers of making 
schemes for the better government and management or endowed schools (except the 
above-mentioned seven, which had been dealt with by the earlier act of 1868, and 
except a few other small classes of exempted schools). This commission was, by 
the endowed schools act of 1874, merged in the board of charity commissioners for 
England and Wales, while another act, passed in the preceding year (1873) modified 
in several points the provisions of the predecessor of 1869. Under these three 
statutes schemes haye been framed and approved by Your Majesty for no less than 
902 endowments in England (excluding Wales and Monmouthshire), leaving only 546 
endowments, out of a total of 1,448 endowments in England, known to be subject 
to the endowed schools acts, which have not felt the reforming hand of the com- 
missioners. By these schemes, which have been in a few cases replaced by amending 
schemes, great improvements have without doubt been effected both in tho constitu- 
tion of the governing bodies and in the educational work and character of the 
grammar schools. Buta good many endowments, as having been founded less than 
fifty years before the passing of the act of 1869, have remained exempt from its 
useful provisions, while, as we shall have to point out presently, the powers of the 
commissioners have not always been found adequate to the needs of the case.” ! 
AGENCIES FOR FOSTERING SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Public agencies.—The existing agencies for secondary education, as enumerated by 
the commissioners, are as follows: First. The school board, which have been active 
in creating “ higher-grade elementary schools.” These are really secondary in their 
character, *‘so far at least as regards their higher classes, in which instruction beyond 
the standards is given. They have, in fact, stepped into the educational void which 
the schools inquiry commissioners, noting it with regret, had oe to fill by 
what they termed ‘secondary schools of the third grade.’” * 
“‘Nor has the tendency thus to extend upward the range of primary instruction 
been confined to school boards. In some voluntary schools also ex-standard classes 
have been established, and upper departments of the higher-grade elementary type 
developed. The act of 1891, which replaced scholars’ fees by a fee grant from the 
national exchequer, may possibly have increased the disposition to allow children to 
remain at school longer than formerly. But it has had another remarkable effect. 
It has rendered needless the old endowments, which, as attached to many elementary 
schools, were used to relieve the pupils from the payment of fees; and in making 
that which was a gift to places that did not possess such endowments—no gift at all 
to those places which did—it has raised the question of finding some purpose to 
which those endowments, no longer needed to replace fees, can in future be usefully 
applied.” 
The second agency has been that of the science and art department, whose grants 
began as far back as 1837, Although not originally made to schools or oven for 
education, through the tendency of legislative and general changes in education 
they have become grants to scholars in schools, and thus virtually grants in aid of 
secondary instruction. 
The third agency is that of ‘‘new institutions for higher education, particularly 
the new university colleges, whose growth has been so notable and interesting a fea- 
ture of the last two decades. In 1868 only three of the eleven English colleges 
which in 1891 were deemed worthy of a share in the eee os grant of £15,000 
had risen to the rank which all have now attained. * * 
“Similar in character to these university colleges, which are open to both men and 
women, we have seen within the same period five new colleges established especially 
for women, viz: Girton (first at Hitchin and now near Cambridge), in 1869; Newn- 
ham (at Cambridge), in 1871; Somerville (at Oxford), in 1879; Lady Margaret Hall 
(at Oxford), in 1879, and Holloway (near Egham in Surrey), in 1866; while another 
women’s college (Bedford College, London) has attained a rank equal to that of 
these five.”

  600 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The fourth of the new agencies is that of the county and county borough councils, 
which by the technical instruction law (1889) were empowered “to levy a rate not 
exceeding 1d. in the pound for the support or aid of technical or manual instruc- 
tion.” Subsequently (1890) the surplus from the beer and spirit duties was turned 
over to the councils, with the privilege of applying the same to technical instruction.! 
INTERMEDIATE EDUCATION (WALES) ACT. 
In discussing these several agencies the commissioners call attention to recent 
legislation affecting secondary education in Weles. By the law passed in 1889 ‘‘the 
power of initiating schemes for educational endowments exercised by the charity 
commissioners under the endowed school acts was transferred for a limited period 
to an education committee of 5 persons, 3 appointed by the local council and 2 by 
tne lord president, constituted for each county and county borough in Wales and 
Monmouthshire.” * * * 
“Although this act has been only five years in operation, enough has already been 
achieved by it to show the importance of concentrating and correlating the various 
local forces and influences that can be used to promote education, and in particular 
to demonstrate the gain to be expected from the establishment of representative 
authorities charged with functions in that behalf.”? 
Voluntary agencies.—In addition to the agencies above considered and which have 
more or less of the official character, the commissioners note ‘the voluntary action, 
both individual and associated, of private persons, which has materially altered the 
aspect of the problem as it presented itself to the schools inquiry commission.” ‘The 
first point,” they say, “‘ which here calls for notico is the change which has taken 
  pl in the status of the teaching profession. In 1868 it was almost entirely unor- 
ga , its members isolated, and but little drawn together by the ties of common 
  interest or common aim. There was comparatively little of that so-called ‘“solidar- 
ity,” or sense of responsibility, at once personal and collective,-;which is necessary to 
the discipline and high tone of a great profession. The state of things to-day shows 
asensibleimprovement. Teaching is now an organized profession, and the tendency 
to consolidation is shown in the growth of several important bodies. The most 
dignified, although the smallest, of these is the Head Masters’ Conference, established 
in 1870, which consists of the heads of the chief endowed public schools of the 
country, 89 in number.” The most numerous is the National Union of Teachers 
(founded in 1870), counting at present about 28,000 members, nearly all engaged in 
elementary schools and not wholly unconcerned with secondary education.” * * * 
“The Association of Head Mistresses dates from 1874, the University Association of 
Women Teachers and Private Schools’ Association from 1883, the Association of 
Asvi.tant Mistresses from 1884, the Teachers’ Guild from 1885, the Incorporated Asso- 
ciation of Head Masters from 1890, and the Association of Assistant Masters, the 
Association of Head Masters of Preparatory Schools, and the Association of Head 
Masters of Higher Grade Elementary and Organized Science Schools from 1892.” 
The College of Preceptors, which is more than an association of teachers, already 
existed in 1868. * * * 
Of private educational associations that are the direct outcome of the report of 
1867 the most important are “The Girl’s Public Day Schools Company, founded in 
1872, which has already 36 schools, with 7,111 pupils; the Church Schools Company, 
founded in 1883, which has 27 schools and 2,166 pupils. Similar private action on a 
smaller scale has created not a few excellent proprietary schools in the large towns, 
especially in those where endowed schools either have been wanting or have fallen 
into torpor; while at the same time the level of private schools generally has risen, 
unequally, no doubt, and in some towns as well as in many rural districts searcely 
at all, yet if we regard the country as a whole, to a substantial degree.” Of the

progress in the education of girls, which the commission of 1864 found in so deplor- 
able a state, the present commissioners say: 
“The improvement which wo have noticed is perhaps most marked in girls’ 
schools, proprietary and private, as well as endowed. School keeping is less fre- 
quently than it used to be the mere resort of ladies possessing no other means of 
support. The development of women’s colleges, the opening, as yet only partial, of 
Oxford and Cambridge to women, the admission of women to classes of the new 
university colleges, has provided a far larger supply of competent women teachers. 
No change of recent years has been more conspicuous than this, nor any more bene- 
ficial. And in considering the causes which have produced this effect the opening 
of university degrees to women, in which the University of London was the pioneer, 
rust not be ignored.” 
In this survey of movements which have taken place since the report of 1867 was 
issued, and which in some measure at least were promoted by that report, the com- 
missioners dwell also upon the increase of popular interest in the cause of educa- 
tion. The schools inquiry commission held that without this interest “legislation 
could accomplish litile; with it there might be many failures and mistakes, but the 
end would certainly be correction and improvement.” Events have gone fur to 
justify their forecast. The intervening period has been one of constant movement 
and experiment in both elementary and secondary education. Between these it has 
been found easier to draw a theoretical than to maintain a practical division, but 
wherever the dividing line may be drawn, instruction has been so enlarged on both 
sides of it that whole regions of knowledge at one time scarcely thought of as fall- 
ing within an educational curriculum have been added to its province. The 
classical languages are taught more extensively than ever, but less as if they were 
dead, and more as if they still lived, rich in all those humanities by virtue of which 
they have been the supreme instruments of the higher culture. And they do not 
now stand alone; ‘a place and a function have been found for modern languages and 
literatures, and it is ceasing to be a reproach that our schools have cultivated dead 
to the exclusion of living tongues. There has been a remarkable and growing use 
in education of certain physical sciences, while technical and manual instruction 
has risen and assumed, especially in certain localities, what may in some respects 
appear to be rather largo proportions. And though some of these extensions repre- 
sent new departments of knowledge, yet they involve instruction in old subjects, 
like mathematics and mechanics, and so build on them that the progress of the 
scholar depends on the knowledge he already possesses of them. ‘The idea of 
technical instruction as a means for the formation of citizens capable of producing 
or distributing wealth has taken hold, though in varying degrees of intelligence 
and intensity, of both our old borough councils and our new county councils, and 
hence has come a concern for that kind of education that we might otherwise have 
looked for in vain.”! 
THE STATE AS A FACTOR IN SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
“Another point which emerges from the comparison of the state of things 
described by the schools inquiry commissioners with that which we see to-day is 
the swift growth in the educational functions of tho State. * * * This growth 
has not been either continuous or coherent, i. ¢., it does not represent a series of 
logical or even connected sequences. Each one of the agencies whose origin has 
been described was called into being not merely independently of the others, but 
with little or no regard to their existence. Each has remained in its working iso- 
lated and unconnected with the rest. * * * 
“This isolation and this independence, if they may seem to witness to the rich 
variety of our educational life and to the active spirit which pervades it, will, nev- 
ertheless, prepare the observer to expect the usual results of dispersed and uncon- 
nected forces, needless competition between the different agencies, and a frequent 
overlapping of effort, with much consequent waste of money, of time, and of 
labor.”

    602 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
SOME CONSIDERATIONS RELATING ESPECIALLY TO THE SECONDARY EDUCATION OF 
GIRLS. 
“Since the schools inquiry commission made their report in 1868 there has proba- 
bly been more change in the condition of the secondary education of girls than in 
eny other department of education. The report of that commission, the action of 
the universities in regard to the higher education of women, and other causes have 
produced an effect which is gradually pervading all classes of the community, and 
through this or other causes the idea that a girl, like a boy, may be fitted by educa- 
tion to earn a livelihood or, at any rate, to be a more useful member of society, has 
become more widely diffused. Thesupply of good schools for girls is now far larger 
than it was twenty-five years ago. 
“Private schools have very much improved, schools for girls under public man- 
agement have sprung into existence, and many parents of the richer classes who 
would formerly have employed private governesses now send their daughters to day 
schools or boarding schools. 
“The increase in the supply of good public secondary schools for girls has probably 
been both an effect and a cause of the great change in public opinion as regards 
their education. This increase is due partly to tho action of the endowed schools 
commission and charity commission in restoring to the use of girls educational endow- 
ments originally intended for them and in directing the application to the education 
of girls of a share of those not specially appropriated to boys. It is perhaps to be 
regretted that more has not been done in this direction. This, however, is a defect 
for which the backward state of public opinion and not the charity commission is 
to blame. The commissioners of 1864 mention only 12 endowed schools for girls in 
England (exclusive of Monmouthshire). There are now some 80 girls’ schools giving 
secondary education in accordance with schemes established under the endowed 
schools acts, and there are other endowments under those acts which are, or under 
certain circumstances may become, available for the secondary education of girls. 
“Indeed, so far as modern beneficiaries are concerned the prospects of higher educa- 
tion for girls and women are exceptionally good. In their latest report the charity 
commissioners, after giving a list of gifts of £1,000 and upwards in the last twenty 
years, make the following remarkable comment: ‘As to one particular branch of 
educational endowments, namely, that for the advancement of the secondary and 
superior education for girls and women, it may be anticipated that future genera- 
tions will look back to the period immediately following upon the schools inquiry 
commission and the consequent passing of the endowed schools acts as marking an 
epoch in the creation and application of endowments for that branch of education 
similar to that which is marked for the education of boys and men by the Reforma- 
tion.’ 
“Another fruitful source of increase in public secondary education for girls has 
been the establishment of proprietary schools on commercial principles—sometimes 
by purely local companies, sometimes by companies extending their operations over 
the whole country or large districts. The most important of the latter class are the 
Girls’ Public Day School Company and the Church Schools Company, which between 
them own 60 schools. Proprietary schools have generally been established and man- 
aged by persons genuinely interested in education, and their success, at least in 
districts where the population suffices to maintain a large school, has been very 
remarkable. They have, moreover, led to the establishment in some places of good 
proprietary and private schools conducted on the same lines. 
“The fees in the schools of which we have been speaking range generally from 9 
to 15 guineas per annum, and the education is continued, when desired, up to the 
age of 19. Proprietary schools giving a less expensive education at a lower feo 
have been less successful, and there seems to be a good deal to be done in improving 
both the demand for and the supply of schools for girls leaving school at about 16 
and unable to pay a high fee. But while this is a serious want, there is also a cer-
-P-A-G-E-661
  THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 603 
tain deficiency in the supply of the more expensive kind of high school, that, 
namely, which can give the very best teaching, and enough of it, in all subjects. 
A better staff is required for this purpose than can be paid out of an average expend- 
iture of about £13 per pupil. There are very few girls’ schools in which the cost 
is so high as £18 or £20 per head; but their popularity shows that there is a demand 
for them, even at self-supporting fees. 
“So far as can be judged from places where the supply of public secondary educa- 
tion of the first and second grade taken together is equal in quantity and quality 
for boys and girls (e. g., Birmingham, Exeter, Thetford), the demand for the two 
sexcs is about equal. As regards education ending at about 14 or 15, it is more 
difficult to judge. There is little public provision of education of this kind outside 
of higher grade elementary schools with ex-standard classes. In most places where 
such ex-standard classes exist they aro less attended by girls than by boys; but 
whether this is because the girls are wanted at home, or because education is thought 
to be less remunerative for girls than for boys, or because the girls are educated else- 
where, or for all these reasons, it is difficult to say. 
“The secondary education required for girls of the industrial classes will necessarily 
differ in some respects from that required of boys of the same classes. But it is 
undesirable that this difference should so be emphasized as to obscure the aim com- 
mon to secondary education for boys and girls alike. There are, broadly speaking, 
two divergent views of this question. In one view practical utility is paramount. 
The girl is to be trained for domestic duties, as the boy is trained for some definite 
calling. In the other view, the first aim is a true education of the mind for girl and 
boy alike; and the special requirements of the industrial classes should, as far as 
possible, be subordinated to that aim. It is not incompatible with the recognition 
of this principle that the girl, like the boy, should receive some special ir-uction 
in the subjects demanded by her special circumstances. 
“Of the grants made to secondary schools by local authorities under the technical 
instruction acts, by far the larger share goes to boys, though the value of the grant 
per head is in many instances the same for the girl as for the boy. 
«With regard to the scholarships provided by the local authorities, girls are in some 
eases excluded; in others, they enter for an open competition with the boys; in 
others, again, the scholarships are definitely apportioned between the two sexes. 
Where this lasé rule obtains, it is common to find that three-fourths are reserved for 
the boys, and one-fourth for the girls; or two-thirds and one-third, respectively. 
Bristol gives 36 senior scholarships to boys and 15 to girls; while of the junior schol- 
arships, 90 are for boys and 15 for girls. In London the intention of the technical 
education board was to allot scholarships in equal proportions to boys and girls. 
But as the number of boys competing was double that of girls, the board decided to 
grant two-thirds to boys and one-third to girls. There were, however, a few spe- 
cial scholarships for girls only. Experience will probably show what the best 
division between the two sexes is in each district, but there is no doubt that for 
girls, as for boys, scholarships are needed, both (1) to enable the cleverer girls (a) 
to enter secondary schools, (b) to prolong their stay in them, and (c) to proceed to 
the universities or other places of higher education; and (2) to serve as a stimulus to 
secondary education and help to keep up the standard. 
“The need of more scholarships to the universities is much felt by girls, more espe- 
cially by the proprietary schools. There is also a need of some scholarships suffi- 
ciently large in amount to cover, or nearly cover, the whole cost of a girl’s university 
education. The St. Dunstan’s scholarships are at present the only ones on this scale, 
and it is understood that even these are not to be continued. A few words may be 
added here on the question of mixed schools. Mixture is the rule in higher grade 
elementary and ex-standard schools, and mixed elementary schools are becoming 
more numerous in England. Such schools ordinarily have men at their head; and 
an apprehension has been expressed that the average quality of the elementary 
 
-P-A-G-E-662
  604 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
schoolmistress may be impaired by the fact that the prospect of becoming a head- 
mistress is, in this case, closed to her. On the other hand, there is at least one 
instance of a headmistress who has several assistant masters under her. 
“In preparatory schools boys and girls are not generally taught together after the 
age of 8. Cases occur, however, in which they can be very successfully taught 
together up to 12 or even 13 to 14. There are also instances of mixed grammar 
schools. In such a school, described by ono of our assistant commissioners, the ages 
of the children appeared to vary ‘from 11 to 17; there were no small children.’ 
Of the 40 pupils, 16 were girls. It would appear that, though the ‘mixed’ system 
will in England be usually confined to elementary education, there are cases in 
which its use for secondary education is practicable and has been successful. In 
small places a considerable gain, not only in economy but in educational efficiency 
may sometimes be secured by having one school rather than two.”! 
WOMEN AS ADMINISTRATORS OF TRUSTS. 
In this connection it is interesting to note that, as the education of women is 
improved, they are brought by a natural pressure into positions of public trust. 
The movement is illustrated by a “‘ Memorandum on the relation of women in England 
to the administration of public charities,” which may be referred to here as rounding 
out the information on this point supplied by the report of the Royal Commission. 
In the introduction the memorandum sets forth that— 
“There is nothing in the general law of England to prevent a woman (as such), 
whether single, married, or widowed, from being a trustee either of a private or a 
public trust. 
“There are, however, certain disadvantages in the trusteeship of a woman which 
have been greatly lessened, though not altogether removed, by the married women’s 
property acts. 
“These disadvantages, coupled with the habits and customs of this country with 
respect to the relations of women to matters of business have produced the result 
that women are seldom trustees of private trusts, and until recently were still less 
often trustees of public trusts. 
“Even in the case of endowed charities for the benefit of girls or women, such as 
an endowed hospital or almshouse for women or an endowed charity school for 
girls, it was, until quite recently, most rare for a woman to.become a trustee. Such 
charities have been numerous in England for some centuries, but until recent legis- 
lation minimized the disadvantages of female trusteeship they were properly con- 
sidered to outweigh the advantages. i 
“For the secondary and superior education of girls and women there existed in 
England, until after the beginning of the latter part of the present century, scarcely 
any endowed charities,? and this fact had a double effect on the relation of women 
to the administration of public trusts in this country. First, on account of the non- 
existence of such charities as these there was no demand for female superintendence 
over a class of trusts in regard to which such superintendence is most valuable; and, 
secondly, for the same reason women of the middle and upper classes of society had 
not been to any great extent educated in such a manner as to render them competent 
in matters of business and administration.* 
“During the last thirty years, however, a great change has been taking place in 
the relation of women to the administration of public charities in England, the 
cause of which may be traced, in part at least, to the following facts.” 
Here the memorandum reviews the work of the commission of 1864 so far as it 
relates to the education of girls and the practical efforts in this direction that resulted 
therefrom as already set forth in the report of the royal commission.

THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 605 
The memorandum then proceeds: 
“The combined effect of all these events, whether legislative or social, has been 
to greatly modify the relation of women to the administration of educational chari- 
ties in England and Wales. Although, as above stated, the Schools Inquiry Com- 
mission made no recommendation as to this matter in their report, the commissioners 
who had the charge of working the endowed schools act of 1869 saw clearly from 
the beginning of their work that it was necessary to provide for women having a 
large share in the administration of educational endowments; and in Paragraph 
XXI of their first report for the year 1871 to the committee of conncil on education 
they made the following observations on this matter: 
“<The last point we have to notice in the constitution of governing bodies is the 
introduction of women. On the one hand we think it hard to maintain, after 
much recent experience, that women are not in very many cases admirably qualified 
to take part in any educational work; in which cases not to use their assistance is 
a waste of resource where resources are scanty enough; but on the other hand wo 
are not prepared to say that to require their introduction in every place would be 
found to work well. We have therefore, as to boys’ schools, simply made women 
eligible on the governing body. But the case seems to us different as to girls’ 
schools, and in those we have, by the schemes, required the presénce of a certain 
number of women as governors.’ 
“‘The policy described in these sentences has, with certain comparatively unim- 
portant variations of detail according to circumstances of cases and the temper of 
the times, been that of their successors, the charity commissioners, in dealing with 
endowments under the endowed schools acts.” 
RSSUME OF EXPERT TESTIMONY AS TO THE PROPER ORGANIZATION 
AND ADMINISTRATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLAND 
AS GIVEN BY SEVERAL WITNESSES BEFORE THE LATE ROYAL 
[ENGLISH] COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION.! 
The testimony given by some 84 witnesses before the late royal com- 
mission on secondary education covers 1,500 closely printed octavo 
pages, which carry more than 17,000 questions and answers. Much of 
this matter, though of the greatest importance to the commissioners, is 
uot well adapted to being placed in a lucidly succinct manner before a 
public familiar with a very direct method of raising revenue for public 
schools of secondary grade and having the simplest way possible of 
allotting it. Two features, however, of the evidence obtained by the 
commission are of interest to a people who do not yet draw educational 
lines on social standing as far as the Caucasian race is concerned. One 
of these is the contention that schools which in the course of many years 
or even centuries have been endowed by private persons are endowed 
also with the purpose of educating the bright boys among the “indus- 
trial or lower middle classes,” who are to be supported in these 
endowed schools by scholarships, while a class of schools called 
“higher grade” are particularly adapted to the average boy of the 
elementary schools.? 
The other feature is the effort to prevent overlapping in these pri- 
vately endowed but publicly used (for clever boys) schools with the 
1 Résumé prepared by Mr. Wellford Addis.

higher grade or secondary school for the average boy. To bring this 
about a sort of general arbitration board, called the central authority, 
was generally proposed to act as a buffer, as it were, between the large 
district or provincial or county authority (the board proposed being 
variously named), and the community, the private schools, and the 
boards of governors of the endowed schools. It would certainly seem, 
from the general drift of the evidence, that in England it is desired to 
segregate the clever boys of poor parents, whether these parents be 
industrial persons, small dectors, lawyers, poor clergymen, or clerks, 
into schools which have a certain, more easily understood than described 
tone about them, but at which the average boy shall not be instructed, 
at least at state (scholarship exhibition) expense. The object of this 
segregation, however, is to more highly educate at state expense those 
found worthy to profit by their advantages, yet too poor themselves to 
meet the expenses of an advanced course of instruction. To bring‘out 
these points the testimony of men of experience, and of large under- 
standing of their specialty, has been introduced, as follows: 
Testimony of Sir George Young, member of the board of charities (to which was intrusted 
the control of endowed secondary schools by the Government of Mr. Disraeli). 
Two objects, distinctly different in character, though concurring to the same end, 
are to be accomplished in organizing secondary education in England: The schools 
must be located (or, to use the witness’s words, the ground must be covered) and the 
schools administered. They must be governed on a comprehensive scheme that has 
sufficient vitality to prevent anarchy, but also elastic enough to allow great swing to 
local aptitudes and wants. The great danger in the work of such a commission as 
that before which he was testifying is that it is disposed to create too much machinery, 
and the strong feeling among teachers and the public that the elementary educational 
department is too centralizing should also be carefully considered in framing a bill 
for the creation of a central authority for secondary education. 
The two objects to be accomplished in introducing secondary schools should be 
effected through two bodies of persons, differing in the source from which they are 
selected. To one body, which is to be merely temporary, should be committed the 
location of the schools and their preliminary organization within an area to be 
determined not by existing county lines, but by expediency. To another subsequent 
and permanent body should be given a certain amount of definite control in specified 
matters, as inspection, examination of scholars, and school supplies, but not the 
control of the school in the ordinary sense of the word, which should be confided to 
alocal board which would be in touch with the head master. 
The first body, or board of location and preliminary organization, should be insti- 
tuted to prevent premature stereotyping of the character of the board. It should 
- be composed of from 11 to 25 members, women being included where of service, the 
majority of whom should be representatives of the county councils, and the others 
nominees of a responsible minister. Ministerial nominees are preferable to persons 
chosen by local educational bodies or professional associations, inasmuch asthey will 
genetally be of a higher character. Teachers (as such) on the preliminary board are 
undesirable, as they are swayed by particular interests. In brief, the qualifications 
required for an agency to cover the ground with schools should consist of those hav- 
ing experience of educational problems, of those having knowledge of and credit in 
the localities to be dealt with, those competent to deal with legal questions, and

those willing to respect continuity of tradition in existing institutions and special 
eare to respect the opinions of parents. : 
The constitution and methods of the permanent or general administrative body 
might be left to the temporary body. Indeed, by the introduction of more especial 
representatives of the university, and of persons learned in the affairs of secondary 
education, the preliminary body might pass into the permanent one. But there is 
difficulty in getting professional persons—the teacher in office is too busy; the 
retired teacher belongs to the past. e 
The area to be treated is of much importance. Considerations of centers of popu- 
lation, convenience of railway transit, and of sizableness must be had. It is 
advisable that educational provinces be created—for instance, that the small coun- 
ties of Cumberland and Westmoreland and that portion of Lancashire called Barrow- 
in-Furness be made a province for educational purposes, and that where two large 
cities are located in one county, as Liverpool and Manchester, instead of making 
county borough educational districts of them they ht be erected each into an 
educational province, with the intervening territory divided between them. In 
short, county bounds should be ignored and utility govern the limits of the educa- 
tional province. 
The central agency has been in Wales, the board of charity commissioners. The 
joint county educational committees referred all proposals of schemes to the charity 
board, who modified and returned them, and if an agreement could not be had the 
matter was referred to the minister. The successful operation of this method was 
due to the presence of an agent of the charity board at the meetings of the joint 
county board when the proposals of a scheme were adopted. It would be indispen- 
sable to have a large corps of such agents if establishing the Welsh system of second- 
ary education in England, especially since Wales was not covered with endowments, 
as was the case in England, being, as it were, a tabula rasa in that respect. The wit- 
ness would insist that he was incompetent to give any decided opinion upon the 
question of making England a tabula rasa in the same respect as Wales, as would 
havo to be the case if elementary education were made directly auxiliary to second- 
ary education by the reconstruction of English educational ideas, and would suggest 
that the powers of the educational department were not so favorably regarded as 
those exercised by the board of charity commissioners ‘‘ where the value of decen- 
tralization was understood.” The central power in secondary affairs should there- 
fore be distinct from any central educational power now existing in England, though 
under the same minister (the vice-president of the committee of council of educa- 
tion), and the eyes of such a central body would be the agenis referred to above. 
Between the central authority and the local boards for each school would be the 
provincial board and possibly, for financial purposes, the county board. But to more 
distinctly characterize the educational province, each one of them if not too small 
might be looked forward to as becoming the possessor of a universityof its own; and 
to unmistakably characterize the provincial board it should be instituted to prevent 
the whole power of control being centered at London. 
The local board should be composed of elected representatives, an education ele- 
ment including elementary teachers or representatives of the elementary school 
board, and two or three members known to be well able to give assistance, but who 
would not likely to go through the annoyances of a popular election. 
The provincial board being a break in the direct operation of the central author- 
ity, though subordinate to it, that authority must depend upon the returns made by 
the localities, the reports of examiners and of its own agents, for dereliction on the 
part of the management of the schools. 
The course of secondary education is modified in England by three factors—the 
necessity of accommodating its character to the length of time to be devoted to it, 
individual parental feeling, and the scholarships offered by Cambridge and Oxford 
to those 18 or 19 years of age. In conformity with the report of the schools inquiry 
commission, the secondary schools were divided into three grades, in each of which the 
 
-P-A-G-E-666
  608 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
pupil was expected to pay a fee, the third grade was intended for those leaving 
before attaining their fifteenth year, the second for those leaving from 15 to 17, and 
the first for those remaining until their eighteenth or nineteenth year. Only one of 
these has had a quiet existence. The elementary school, by increasing its curriculum 
above the three R’s and the correlative studies, and by offering free tuition, squeezed 
out the third-grade secondary school against the second grade, and the second grade, 
in which Greek was prohibited, was objected to by parents, who, though in an 
abstract sense objecting to the strictly classical system of the old grammar schools, 
are desirous, as parents, of giving their children that kind of education even yet. 
Indeed, at Bradford and Wakefield the endowed schools commissioners were so hotly 
opposed in their attempt to make the school there into a second grade, that they 
were compelled to yield. The tendency to keep boys at a secondary school has 
passed beyond reason, considering how desirable it is that they should enter upon the 
freer life of a university; and to drive up the age, as Oxford and Cambridgo have 
done, is to increase the expense, and it is probable that the richer universities of 
England will become the universities of the rich, and the poorer universities the 
universities of the poor. It is said that in Scotland a very large proportion of the 
best students enter the university at 15 or 16. This would create a social distinction, 
which would antagonize the work of the secondary, in mingling the rich and poor, 
as the objection made by some parents to having their children mingle with those 
of people whom they consider to be ina lower social grade than themselves has 
considerably diminished, though more slowly in schools for girls than in those for 
boys. Now and then the secondary school authorities are met with a social-status 
difficulty when for the first time they introduce boys by merit from the class that 
attend public elementary schools into a secondary school, but experience has in 
almost every instance led the local people to see that their fears were unfounded, and 
the anticipations of the endowed schools commissioners that there would be no 
practical obstacle to the admission of promising boys from elementary schools to 
so-called second-grade schools. 
Were the universities to lower the age from 19 to 17, it might be necessary to alter 
the regulations governing admission to the army; but it isnot at all certain that the 
candidates for the army desire a realschule education, just at this time at least, as 
such candidates come from the upper classes, which have by no means ceased to 
desire a classical education for their sons; for from recollections of his own experi- 
ence in examining for army entrance the witness was strongly inclined to say that the 
education encouraged by those examinations was intended to be that generally given 
in the great public schools. When pupils are going to leave at different ages—say 
one part at 16 years of age and another at 18—it is preferable to have them in different 
schools if the funds permitted. Departments limited by age, or by fee, or by curricu- 
lum, have broken down in every school where they have been tried. Modern sides 
parallel with classical sides have been more successful, but are clearly less efficient 
than separate schools, because the head master can not be equally interested in the 
performance of both sides. A third and least desirable form is the second-grade 
secondary school with a first-grade top. It is very desirable to have a limitation of 
age after which boys should not be allowed to stay in aschool, for if boys aro allowed 
to stay after the age specified there will be an upper class of boys which will have the 
principal attention of the master and give a cast to the whole curriculum in a direc- 
tion in which it should not be influenced—that is to say, on the old classical lines. 
Governing bodies are ambitious, and would like to see their school a first-grade sec- 
ondary school. No one can object to seeing a first-grade secondary school in the hands 
of a first-rate classical scholar, but it is objectionable to see second-rate classical 
scholars getting the best second-grade secondary schools and the poorer secondary 
schools being mastered by those who can only be described as third-rate scholars, all 
of which is a very great discouragement to those who desire to make themselves 
proficient in modern subjects.

  THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 609 
It is impossible to logically arrange the distribution or grading of schools in the 
rural districts. There one must permit a single school to do two kinds of work. 
In regard to the spirit in which these schools are to be conducted the whole limi- 
tation of the local grants, under the customs and excise act, to technical education, 
or rather to anything which is not literary, will have to be removed. To retain it 
would distort the balance of the curriculum. The appropriation of the fund should 
be made to the literary or the technical side at discretion of the county councils. 
Testimony of Dr. R. B. Poole, head master of the Bedford Modern School, representing 
the Head Masters’ Association. 
The Head Masters’ Association has a membership of 270, and is open to all head 
masters that have no pecuniary interest in the company which manages the school 
finances. There is also the Head Masters’ Conference, composed of those who pre- 
pare principally for the universities. Together these associations have 370 members, 
a little more than one-half of the head masters in England and Wales. The Head 
Masters’ Association considered that there should be a central educational board, 
which should consist of various nominees by the Crown, the universities, and other 
bodies, such, for example, as their own. This board should be presided over by a 
minister of education, and through him be represented in and be responsible to 
Parliament. 
The powers of the central board should be large; it should be the ruling and regu- 
lating power over all secondary education, whether supported in part by the State or 
municipalities, by endowment, or wholly by fees. It should be a court of appeal in 
regard to the placement of new schools, the amalgamation of others when they are 
too numerous or are ineffective, and should have the direction and inspection of all 
the secondary schools of the country; but those regulations should be carried out 
by an intermediary body called the provincial council, which would be supposed to 
exert great influence in the formation of the regulations in the way of adapting 
thei to local needs. 
The provincial body might have for its jurisdiction either the area of a county or 
of a group of counties, the aim being to have a jurisdiction containing from one to 
two millions of people, though no subdivision of counties, even if urban, should be 
made. The powers of the provincial council should be locally executive, to levy 
rates, to invite proposals for supplies, to suggest the scheme of instruction adapted 
to its particular province, to carry out the general orders of the central board, and 
to report to that board the places where necessity dictated that new schools should 
be established and the ways and means thereto. 
The nonlocal, national, or so-called public schools (the 9 so called and about as 
many more not so styled) should not be placed under the authority of the provincial 
body, though they should be connected with the system of secondary education 
through scholarships from second-grade schools (for boys ending their schvoling at 
17) tothem. All private schools should be registered, and one of the prerequisites of 
ability to register should be that each school must submit itself to the inspection 
of the provincial council. e 
Each school should have its own governing body, except in large towns, where 
number of such bodies may be amalgamated perhaps with advantage. It is most 
desirable that members of governing bodies should be locally interested in the 
schools which they govern. Upon this governing body the head master should 
have a consultative seat, but no vote. He should have the power of appointing and 
dismissing his assistants with an appeal to the governing body; indeed, such an 
appeal being open, it would be easier practically for a head master to discharge an 
assistant than if the matter rested wholly in himself. 
The class of persons who require to have a new or improved system of secondary 
education given to them are what may be called the lower middle classes. There are 
ED 95. 20   
 
-P-A-G-E-668
  610 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
a large number of artisans who would be able to pay £6 annually for several of the 
children in attendance at secondary schools. A considerable number of children 
whose parents were too poor to pay the £6 would be able to obtain it through 
scholarships from the clementary schools. To furnish these scholarships, the county 
boards would have to be called upon to eke out the endowments given to many 
elementary schools for the purpose. In regard to witness’s own school at Bedford, 
which enrolled 600, 100 boys came from the country, attracted by the low rate of 
tuition fees (£4). Some of these came 20 miles, but it is found, in general, that the 
distance they have to come detracts a great deal from their mental faculty. 
The salaries of assistant masters is entirely inadequate. In a great many schools 
there are masters who are not receiving more than £100 or £120 annually, and there 
are a considerable number of younger people who are receiving still less. The 
witness knew of cases where £60 or £70 were received. In all these cases board 
and lodging are excluded. In the Bedford School, one of the most richly endowed 
in England, one-half of the assistant head masters are university men, and a number 
of them oyer 35 years of age. 
Testimony of Rev. E. F. M. MacCarthy, M. A., vice-chairman of the Birmingham school 
board and head master of King Edward’s Grammar School, Fiveways, Birmingham, 
representing the Association of School Boards of England and Wales. 
The witness made a fundamental distinction between secondary schools supported 
by endowment and those supported by the county council. The curriculum of an 
endowed secondary school (of second grade) is based on the understanding that the 
pupil enters the school at an early age (say under 11 years of age) and remains there 
for five or six years. Now a pupil who has completed the sixth standard of the ele- 
mentary education code in a public elementary school is 12 or 13 yearsof age. Such 
a pupil using the endowed secondary school as a continuation school enters the lat- 
ter with a mental equipment much narrower in range than the pupils of corres- 
ponding age among whom he finds himself. He suffers many disadvantages on this 
account. A pupil, however, who leaves the public elementary school earlier (say 
after passing Standard IV or V) suffers fewer disadvantages, though naturally a 
clever pupil of any given age suffers less from the dislocation than an average pupit 
of the same age. 
A protest should be entered against the widely prevailing theory that only clever 
pupils from public elementary schools are to be expected to desire to continue their 
education in an endowed secondary school. Endowed secondary schools should be 
open to all classes of pupils, whether they are clever or not. Any parent of a child 
of even average ability is justified in desiring a continuation school above the ele- 
mentary school for his child, and thus, when he has completed the course of the 
elementary school, to pass him on to an endowed secondary school for his further 
education, provided the parent is pecuniarily able to do so. The usefulness of the 
endowed secondary school, as contradistinguished from the secondary school sup- 
ported by the county (that is, as far as Birmingham is concerned), is limited by the 
fact that only those pupils who have left the elementary schools at 10 or 11 (Stand- 
ard IV or V) achieve as a rule any measure of success. Many even of these having 
received a narrow range of training, and being only of average ability, had much 
better have remained and completed their course at the public elementary school, 
and then they would have found a natural continuation school in the county board 
school, but pupils of 12 or 13 who have gone right through the ordinary public ele- 
mentary school course (passed Standard VI), or pupils of 14 or 15 who haye spent 
some time beyond Standard VI in a higher grade elementary or board secondary 
school (like the holders of county council technical scholarships or exhibitions) are 
certainly not fitting subjects to be dealt with by an endowed secondary school. All 
these come too late and leave too soon to derive much benefit. The point, therefore, 
is that the board secondary school is the natural continuation school to a public 
elementary school, and should therefore be further developed and better adapted to
-P-A-G-E-669
THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. ‘611 
meet those new wants, to obtain which these older children now seek an endowed 
secondary school, but which an endowed secondary school does not and can not 
supply. 
As to whether it is desirable to carry on technical education (in its earlier stages) 
as a department of a secondary school proper or relegate it to an institution wholly 
devoted to such instruction, the former alternativo is the better, for the following 
reasons: The teaching staff being available for both “sides,” the teaching of mathe- 
matics and science on the nontechnical side would be carried on more efficiently 
than if the technical side were a distinct school. The samo would be true of the 
teaching of literary subjects and mathematics on the technical side. Again, in any 
arrangement involving distinct schools there would be a tendency to the establish- 
ment of social distinctions between the schools, for the danger of a separate lower- 
grade technical school is this: It is said that it is a school for the sons of artisans, 
and the other is the school for the sons of gentry or the middle classes. If the 
schools are under the same head but are divided into two departments, then there 
would be no chance of social distinctions as between those who are on the technical 
side and those who are on the other. 
The present school boards are the only power to which the whole department of 
education should be intrusted, because they are the only people that can do the 
work. All matters pertaining to elementary and secondary education should be 
intrusted to an ideal school board such as does not exist inEngland, A good school 
board for secondary education alone would be one elected by the ratepayers, with 
the powers of an existing school board for elementary schools. 
Té is found that the technical education given in the board secondary schools is 
not filling the minds of any of the children with a desire for the kind of life for 
which they have not the ability adequate for success (see Note A), but the endowed 
secondary school (King Edward’s school) is drawing a large class of boys into sec- 
ondary schools, where they pick up ideas about their future career which are clerkly 
in character and which they had much better not entertain as far as their own 
prospects are concerned. 
There should be no fees for [secondary] education anywhere. 
Testimony of John Bidgood, esq., B. Sc., head master of the Gateshead Higher Grade 
School and the secretary of the Association of Head Masters of Higher Grade Schools 
representing his Association. 
The first aim of the higher grade school is to carry on education beyond that 
which is called elementary. Most schools in England carry on the children to, say, 
the sixth standard—seldom higher—and a higher grade school is to carry them 
further forward (from the fourth standard) ; in some cases this carrying forward may 
be only for a year or two, and in others to four or five years. The second aim of the 
higher grade school is to make this education as well fitted for the purposes of such 
children as they possibly can. In some schools the pupils are taught partly under 
the code of the education. The witness would prefer that pupils should come to his 
school at standards IV and V, in which case the beginnings of higher education 
can be laid down and carried on into the sixth and seventh standards, with the 
notion of a continuance of three or four years beyond that stage. But in many 
towns education in the higher grade schools is free, and therefore the school boards 
have confined all the elementary education to the ordinary elementary schools up to 
and including the sixth standard, and after that the children aro sent to these 
schools, which become higher schools than the sixth standard. In other places the 
board have made the arrangement of admitting only pupils of the sixth and seventh 
standards. The larger number of schools are not free; only schools lately estab- 
lished have free tuition, a condition exacted by the education department. But in 
all fee-charging schools there are donational scholarships, so that practically there 
is no child in England who wants a higher education but can get it free (deposed by 
D. Forsyth, M. A., D. Sc.), and in the Leeds Higher Grade School (witness’s own) there 
 
-P-A-G-E-670
612 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
are 200 such scholarships. Besides, all school boards have the power of remitting 
fees. The fees for tuition are only one source of revenue, another are the grants 
from the science and art department, and a third source are the grants from county 
councils from local taxation, 
As the higher grade schools are schools for the people, our association feels that 
they should be under a board elected by the people for educational purposes. It is 
the pride of our schools that they are in touch with the people and with their needs. 
The endowed (or ‘‘ grammar schools”)! draw exclusively from the upper classes. 
Testimony of Charles Henry Wyatt, esq., clerk of the Manchester school board and represent- 
ative of the Association of School Boards (England and Wales), of which he is honorary 
secretary. 
There should be one local educational authority in each area which should be called 
the board of education, and should have the control of elementary, secondary, and 
technical education, but not of the university if one, within that area. The adop- 
tion of such a proposal would abolish the whole of the rural school boards, and in 
towns the existing school boards would be given the power to add representatives 
dealing with secondary education. To these boards of education should be given 
also the charge of the provision of additional secondary education. There should 
be such a board of education for each county borough (urban district), and for the 
“administrative” (i. e. nonurban) parts of counties. This board should be elected by 
the ratepayers, and might vary in the number of its members according to population 
or other local circumstances. The board should have power to appoint special com- 
mittees in each district or group of districts, whose province should be to deal sepa- 
rately with matters affecting secondary, technical, and primary education; and upon 
the committees dealing with secondary and technical education it should be compe- 
tent for the district board to appoint representatives from the governing bodies of 
university colleges, existing secondary schools under the charity commissioners 
(wherever rate aid may be given), the teaching profession, or any other persons whose 
influence and assistance would be of value. All these boards should be under a 
strict central authority, which would not centralize too much, as the control of the 
education department is a wholesome control. One of the greatest advantages aris- 
ing from this proposed arrangement would be the abolition of rural school boards, 
which are on all hands considered objectionable. In short, there would be three 
great authorities, the school board, the central authority, and the minister; the 
central authority having the power now possessed by six different bodies, to wit: 
The education department, the science and art department, the local government 
board, the home office, the public works loan commissioners, and the charity com- 
missioners. The evils of the present system of having several powers dealing with 
the same thing can be well illustrated by the divergent action of the science and art 
department and the education department. The latter has abolished payment by 
results; the former has really accentuated the evils of that system by holding exami- 
nations more adapted to statistical purposes than to the needs of the students. The 
minister would be responsible to Parliament, and as such would take the whole 
management of the work. 
A necessary connecting link between the elementary schools and the secondary 
schools proper is the so-called higher grade school. Such schools, properly organized, 
would crown the elementary system. It is thought that for boys and girls whose 
education will cease at the age of 16, the secondary education which may be 
imparted by these schools is of the kind best suited to their wants. These schools, 
properly organized, would be the direct feeders of the technical schools and of the 
1It is scarcely necessary to say that the English terms “‘ public schools ” and “ grammar schools” 
do not connote what is understood when those terms are used in this country. The English ‘public 
schools” are 9 very expensive institutions (Eton, Rugby, etc.), and in general the English “ gram- 
mar schools” are classical high schools,
-P-A-G-E-671
THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 613 
secondary schools of the second and third grades. But the present prominence 
which is given to science teaching and the absolute neglect of many branches of 
general education seriously interfere with the practical value of the higher grade 
schools as these are now established in Manchester, where there are 6, with accom- 
modation for 7,104 children. For instance, it is found that a boy leaving one of 
those higher grade schools will, in the subjects in which he has been taught, be on 
a level with any boy in such schools as the Manchester Grammar School (classical 
secondary), but in Latin and Greek he will be nowhere. The higher grade schools 
should be organized to obviate this defect, but an organization of that kind must 
be freed from the operation of the present rules affecting organized science schools, 
which are almost invariably associated with schools of this type. The seating 
capacity of higher grade schools in England and Wales is now 40,898, and there are 
6,629 children in them in classes beyond the standards. But it should be borne in 
mind that a great deal of secondary work is done within the standards. This class 
of schools affords opportunity for the most talented and intelligent of the elementary 
school-teachers, while they also provide an admirable training ground for young 
people desirous of becoming teachers. It is well to have a preparatory department 
to such schools; such a department gives a backbone to the school which is other- 
wise wanting where the whole body of its pupils are transferred from elementary 
schools. The idea of the organization contemplated in the foregoing testimony 
(reading from the bottom up and supposing no absolutely necessary connection (?) 
between the columns) may be expressed graphically thus—

each haye as a base a preparatory school for those who, owing to class distinctions’ 
of various kinds, will never be found in great numbers in the public elementary 
schools. In the preparatory department of the higher grade school languages and 
literature might be taught at suitable ages, in order to facilitate.the passing of pupils 
into the secondary schools of the second grade, and from the higher grade school 
might also pass those who desire a technical education in the institutions provided 
for the purpose. But technical schools have not been set forth in the diagram, 
because they are special places of tuition, just as are schools of music and of the 
fine arts—all necessary in their way for those whose needs they supply, but not an 
essential part of the supply of general education for the bulk of the boys and 
girls who have gone through the elements of instruction in a public elementary 
school, in the preparatory department of a higher grade school, or in the lower divi- 
sion of a school of the “grammar (classical) school” type. The effect of science and 
art grants upon higher grade schools is not satisfactory, as they exert too great 
influence upon the course of instruction given in the school, and much of the science 
teaching can only be fragmentary and of little practical value. The fifteen hours a 
week which have now to be devoted to the work of the science and art department 
in organized science schools renders the teaching of literary subjects an impossi- 
bility. The scheme thus laid before the commission has for its major the intention 
of the parent with regard to the child’s future career. A fee should be charged in the 
higher grade school, though not sufficiently large to make the school self-supporting. 
Evening continuation schools should be deemed agencies for secondary education. 
Testimony of C. Bowdon, esq., head master of the Wesleyan Schools, Gateshead, formerly 
president of the National Union of Teachers, and representing that body before the com- 
mission. 
The members of the association, numbering 26,000 teachers, feel great interest in 
secondary education, and desire to sce the methods of passage from one class of 
schools to another improved and made more easy both for scholars and teachers, con- 
sidering that primary education would be greatly advanced by being brought into 
organic relation with secondary education. They wish that one educational author- 
ityshould control the education of the country, centraland local; and they consider 
this essential in order to secure efficiency in schools, because the secondary schools 
at present are under no proper control or really effective supervision. They say that 
if there were two authorities to control education, one primary and one secondary, 
there would be undue competition between the two authorities, as there is at pres- 
ent between those administering the money that is generally called the whisky 
money! and the school boards. The county councils are doing work that the school 
boards are doing, though the boards, being the first in the field, think that they have 
aright to do the work. They think that if there were one authority, instead of 
competition, there would be coordination, and that the one authority would be able 
to establish various classes of schools instead of there being rivalry between those 
two authorities in establishing the same class of schools. They also say that at 
present there is no convenient passage from school to school; that those who know 
the children in the elementary schools know which of them would be benefited by 
secondary education; that if there were an authority for secondary education only, 
that authority would have no knowledge of the wants and desires of the parents of 
the children in the elementary schools and could not provide adequately for those 
desires. They say that it is much better that things should grow naturally rather 
than that they should start from two different points; that if there were a local 
authority to control secondary education it would really deal more with a class of 
people than with the whole of a people, and that it would really be class education 
rather than secondary education. They say that a great deal of energy would be 
wasted, as well as public and private money, and that there would be a great deal of

overlapping. If there were two bodies for the purpose of controlling education, 
there would be two sets of officials, for example, where one would suffice, and there 
would be two applications to the rating authority where one would suffice. 
If there were one authority (local) for a large district, it would induce a number 
of educated persons to become members of that authority. Representing various 
interests, these people would see that there were various types of schools. No one 
who desires the good of the country would wish to have our schools made of one 
uniform character, and it seems that if there were a large body, authority being 
exercised over a great district, there would be much more chance for a diversity of 
schools than there would be if there were two authorities. As was said before, if 
there were an authority for secondary education only, that power would deal with 
it more for class education than for the education of the whole of the people in the 
country. The best area for a district is the administrative county [rural districts]. 
The commission of 1868 suggested more than one county, but the population has 
grown very laregly since then. But even the districts for electing members of 
Parliament might be taken, as the people are accustomed to vote together; this 
would give about 50,000 souls to the district, but county boroughs (large cities) 
should not be dislocated. 
The present school boards in towns should be elected by the rate payers, and 
should be enlarged by the admission of persons elected by teachers. To such a board 
of education should be committed all the primary and secondary education of the 
town. The schools should be free. 
The secondary schools at present do not supply the wants of the vast majority of 
the people. They are too few in many places, and are unsuitable in character; that 
is to say, they are mainly classical schools. We have only, at the outside, 3,000 per- 
sons going to the universities; there are about 1,000 freshmen at Oxford and 1,000 
at Cambridge every year. The majority of the people want their children not so 
much to go to the universities as to get that education which will enable them to 
take their places in the industrial occupations of the country, and it is evident that 
the so-called higher-grade schools are serving that purpose admirably. The great 
improvement in those schools to be effected is the lessening of the excessive science 
instruction. 
Testimony of the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of London (a member of the Schools 
Inquiry Commission, 1864-1868.) 
The Schools Inquiry Commission looked upon secondary education in its report 
entirely as education to be paid for by the parents, and it is therefore necessary to 
look carefully around as to the proper manner of adjusting a system of free sec- 
ondary education founded on that report with one for which the parents are to pay. 
It should be considered that parents will send their children to the better secondary 
schools in spite of the fact that such attendance costs money, and also that tho social 
status feeling operates to the same end. It is impossible to have a regular continu- 
ation between the different classes of schools from the elementary to the lower grade 
of the secondary and from that to the higher grade of the secondary; but though 
each school must stand apart, it is nevertheless possible to form a ladder with picked 
boys. You can carry boys from a lower grade school to a higher if they have been 
carefully picked, whereas you could not carry average boys at all. With the average 
boy the lower grade must distinctly prepare for the higher and be practically a prepar- 
atory school for the higher, or else when the boy gets into the higher he is altogether 
thrown out. But with the picked boy, if you do not exceed a reasonable number, 
it requires really very little special adaptation to bring the boys into proper relations 
with the whole school system and course of instruction in the higher position. Tho 
mistake which is frequently made is that people suppose there is a very large number 
of boys who may be rightly picked out from the lower schools and put into the 
higher, whereas the number of boys who could be so picked out is really very small, 
It is doubtful whether it is wise to provide for the average boy a means of progressing
-P-A-G-E-674
616 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
from the elementary school to schools of a higher kind. The thing to be feared is 
that the elementary school will step into the place of schools which prepare boys 
for commercial pursuits, clerkships in offices, and so on, which is a place they can 
not readily fill. It is better that those boys should be in really secondary schools, 
and secondary education should not be free, for though the plea of poverty comes 
in at all turns, it is difficult to see why the parent is to expect that his child should 
be educated beyond his own means of providing education any more than that his 
child should be fed or clothed beyond his own means of providing food or clothing. 
1t is not a social feeling, but really a preference for a certain characteristic of the 
education given, that induces a preference of parents for a certain school. There 
can be no doubt that a school in which you have a large preponderance of boys of a 
very low social grade is not in that sense a very good place of education for boys of 
amuch higher grade. On the other hand, if you have the preponderance the other 
way, the boys of the lower social grade are really the better for being in constant 
companionship with boys of a higher social grade. It is necessary to keep in view 
the cultivation of manners as a part of the education of the children, and not only 
the manners, but of what belongs to the moral principle of cultivated people. The 
average boy will hardly pass through the elementary schools until he is 14. The 
child must not be pushed, for it is important to note that a whole nation must go on 
very slowly in that matter, and you will find after your elementary education has 
been going on for a certain length of time you can teach higher subjects to boys of 
the same age than you could have done at the beginning, because their homes are 
already beginning to be affected. Those who have been in the schools have become 
the parents, so now a good deal of the teaching of what are called class subjects is 
very much better than it was. In the past the pressure to have such subjects taught 
was mischievous, and in the future it will be better than it is now. 
It might be taken for granted that, secondary education being self-supporting, the 
impecunious classes would have to be content with elementary education, unless 
for the purpose of culling out the cleverer boys for the service of the State that por- 
tion of the impecunious community should be given scholarships which would 
enable them to enter upon secondary education. It is not in point to say that such 
conditions will incorporate, so to speak, class distinctions; the thing can not be 
helped. You have an enormous number that are excluded from the university. 
The State is not prepared to take upon itself all grades of education up to the top. 
As to the assistance of clever boys, the scholarships should be of small value and 
open to rich and poor, but in the case of the successful poor competitor the author- 
ities should have the power of augmenting them to the extent demanded by the 
pecuniary income of the parent, but it is not probable that anything you could 
devise will enable children from the elementary school to compete for scholarships 
at Eton, for example. 
Secondary education should not be managed on the same centralized system as 
primary education; there should be between him and the immediate governing body 
another. 
Testimony of Rev. T. W. Sharpe, senior chief inspector of schools, 
Secondary as well as elementary education should be free. The imputation that 
universally free secondary education will unduly increase the number of persons 
who are indisposed to manual labor is unjustified as the matter corrects itself. At 
one time in the elementary schools of England there were a great number of chil- 
dren who were endeavoring to become clerks, but there has been a distinct reaction 
in favor of the artisan class of late, since the wages of artisans have risen. The 
same thing would probably happen in a higher class of education. School boards 
are not a proper authority to govern secondary education, which should be com- 
mitted to a county or provincial council. It is desirable from a theoretical stand- 
point that elementary and secondary education should be under the same authority,
-P-A-G-E-675
THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 617 
but persons experienced in education, teachers of all classes, should be placed upon 
the county or provincial council. In regard to the attendance of children residing 
in the rural districts their traveling expenses should be paid to and from the sec- 
ondary school they were compelled to attend. 
In his evidence regarding free education the witness had had before him the 
pecuniary difficulties of clerks, poor clergymen, and poor doctors. 
Testimony of Sir John F, D. Donnelly, secretary of the science and art department. 
The science and art department in general deals with industrial classes; that is to 
say, with those whose parents receive for labor or as income in any form fewer than 
$2,000 (£400). Secondary education is rather undefinable. Elementary education is 
intended for those who leave to engage in business at 12 or 13, secondary for those 
who leave at 16 or 17, and higher for the university student. Now, the elementary 
education of a boy who is going to leave school at 12 or 13 should not allow him to 
take up subjects which he can not carry to some definite conclusion by remaining 
until 16 or 17, nor those contemplating leaving at 16 or 17 should not have elements 
introduced that require a university career to carry out. 
The work of the science and art department is an interpolation into the ordinary 
system of a literary school or a standing invitation to the foundation of a new school 
whereby in chemistry, for instance, £2 is given for every pass in the higher grade 
of elementary schools, £1 for every pass in the lower grade in secondary schools, 
and £1 for every pass in the higher grade of secondary schools [the sum annually 
so distributed amounts to £750,000]. Formerly the lower grade of science instruc- 
tion in elementary schools was given £1 for every pass, but the county educational 
authorities have relieved the science and art department of encouraging such ele- 
mentary instruction by giving a capitation on attendance. The schools that have 
taken up the organized science school curriculum are not, as a rule, the ordinary sec- 
ondary or endowed schools, as they can not well give the time to that curriculum, 
and therefore are compelled to take one or two subjects only. It therefore follows 
that the organized science schools are elementary schools, and, in general, the depart- 
ment fosters secondary education in a narrow sense of the term, as distinguished from 
the general sense, for the organized science school is for the student who is going to 
work principally, if not entirely, in a scientific direction. The grants to organized 
science schools should be larger and with such grants should be conjoined the 
requirement that literary instruction should be given to a larger extent than at 
present in those organized science schools. 
Testimony of Sir Bernhard Samuelson, Bart., M. P., chairman of the late technical educa- 
tion commission and of the technical committee of the Oxfordshire County council. 
Witness would not aid technical secondary education unless some general educa- 
tion were present, as technical education can not be effectively given unless it is 
combined with general education; not only that, indeed, but for higher technical 
education good general education is absolutely necessary, for, as the technical edu- 
cation committee reported, ‘‘The best preparation for technical study is 9 good 
modern secondary school.” Under the term “ technical education” he would include 
everything which prepares a man or woman for the walk in life which he or she 
intends to pursue. Such instruction should be given in technical departments or 
classes attached to secondary schools, that is, as far as young people are concerned. 
There is very little reliance to be placed on technical education in the primary [ele- 
mentary ?] school unless it be merely some object lessons and drawing. If there were 
capacity for it, the technical education should commence at a very early age in 
secondary schools, or rather in preparatory departments of secondary schools: 
It would be inadvisable to take the control of technical education from the pro- 
vincial or county body having control of secondary education, and also undesirable 
ED 95. 20*

  618 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
to have any central educational authority other than the minister of education, all 
the proposed functions of such a body being mainly retained by the county council 
and the rest of the responsibility fixed upon a single man, the minister of education, 
to whom should be intrusted the registration of private schools. 
Testimony of Mr. John Montgomery, assistant master in Parmiter’s School, Victoria Park, 
and honorary secretary of Association of Assistant Masters, which body he represents. 
The associations of 460 members from all classes of secondary schools, endowed or 
unendowed, public or private. As to the qualifications considered necessary for a 
head mastership his association held that a degree is necessary in every public sec- 
ondary school, as at present required by about one-third of the schemes of the charity 
commission, while in a majority of other casesit is required that he shall have either 
the degree or such other qualification as the governors may approve of. Of596 schools 
for boys of which they had information, 503 have head masters who are graduates, 
to wit: From Oxford 156, Cambridge 196, Dublin 44, London 109, other universities 
in United Kingdom 12, foreign universities 1; total, 518; counting none twice, 503, 
Of the 596 head masters 283 are in holy orders. The association also held that the 
candidates for head masterships should be required to have five years’ experience as 
assistant masters in a public secondary school. 
The assistant masters demand that there should be a right of appeal in every caso 
to the governing body of the school. 
His association would also suggest that the charity commission require that the 
governing body of every school should once a year send in a financial return, which 
is not always done. By the courtesy of the charity commissioners the association has 
been noting down and investigating the various items in the financial returns, and 
in some cases, in order to get the financial return of a school, they have had to go 
back to the year 1886, though they have not gone back any further. The blank 
form issued by the charity commission is not, in their opinion, the best form, but 
in that form it is required that thero shall be shown the yearly rate of payment to 
each teacher, but in nearly half the cases this is not done. In some returns the 
salaries of the assistant masters appear under the head of ‘assistant masters, appa- 
ratus,” ete. Then the number of boys is not given in about half the cases, although 
required, and on the whole the returns are not well made. But from such informa- 
tion as they have been able to obtain they find that in well endowed public sec- 
ondary schools that the average pay of the assistant master is about £150. They 
consider that assistant masters in public secondary schools are poorly paid, and that 
in founding secondary schools some provisions should be made for the salary of such 
masters. The schemes state as arule that the governors shall fix a sum for assistant 
masters and apparatus, but inno scheme is there any provision as to what proportion 
of the endowment or how much per head should be assigned as the salary of assistant 
masters. Many cases occur where the staff of five or six or even more assistant mas- 
ters receive no more than the head master. Such provision should be based on the 
minimum cost of efficient education per head and the assignment of a certain propor- 
tion of that minimum to salaries for assistant masters, taking into account the amount 
of available income and the number of boys. 
All vacancies should invariably be advertised in the newspapers and be announced 
by no other means.

for the administration of secondary schools for boys:

[In the course of the examination of the witness his assqciate, Mr. Martin, inter- 
jected the following: ‘‘Ishould like to bring this fact before the commission that, 
under the present conditions, when a head master resigns his post or is dismissed he 
has to give notice to every assistant master on the staff, for the reason that the 
assistant masters are his servants and not the servants of the governors; so that 
when you dismiss the head master you dismiss every man in the school. I think 
that is a point on which assistant masters feel rather keenly.” Of course this is in 
many cases a mere form, but it is practically applied in the case of a new head 
master having a system rather different from that of the retiring master.]

CHAPTER XIV. 
PAPERS ACCOMPANYING THE REPORT OF THE ROYAL 
COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
REPORT ON CERTAIN FEATURES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND IN CANADA. 
My Lorps, Lapirs, AND GENTLEMEN: I received instructions on the 27th of 
August last to proceed to the United States and make inquiries upon topics embraced 
within the province of the royal commission on secondary education. 
In the first instance I received a paper entitled ‘ Heads of information which it is 
desired to obtain from the United States of America,” with a similar paper relating 
to Canada, and I was‘instructed to obtain a more complete answer to these inquiries 
than had already been obtained by correspondence. I came up to the office of the 
commission in London and examined the answers to this paper of questions which 
have already been received from some twelve prominent teachers and professors in 
the United States and from Principal Grant, of Kingston, in Canada. 
I was also fortunate enough to secure an interview with the chairman of the coni- 
mission, who gave me verbal instructions which enlarged the scope of my task. 
While giving due attention to the points raised in the ‘‘ Heads of information,” Iam 
to keep in view the whole ground of inquiry which is undertaken by the commission, 
and, in order to enable me to judge of the questions at issue, I was supplied with 
various printed papers, by the perusal of which I may follow the lines of inquiry 
which the commission is pursuing. The chairman also pointed out that it would be 
necessary for me to conduct my work very rapidly, and to present my report early 
in the winter, and, since it may be difficult to complete a satisfactory statement 
within such a short time, the chairman suggested that I should forward letters or 
portions of report on any topic which seemed to me to be of importance; and, as I 
have spent a considerable time in the study of education in Germany, it was pointed 
out that I might profitably incorporate any experience I had thereby gained in ques- 
tions where the comparison of German methods might be helpful. 
Further, I was instructed to examine two reports which have, in previous years, 
been published under Government authority; the voluminous account of the common 
school system of the United States and Canada, presented by the Rev. James Fraser 
(afterwards bishop of Manchester) to the royal commission (1867),' and a brief 
account of American schools by Mr. Fitch, Her Majesty’s senior inspector of schools, 
printed by the education department in 1889. 
Under the present circumstances, it has seemed to me that it would be of little 
service if I were to attempt to prepare a sketch of the organization of secondary 
education in America or to describe any institution and methods in detail; indeed, 
the short time at my disposal makes such a task impossible. I have followed an 
  
1 Question 8, in the ‘‘ Heads of information,” is, I understand, intended to suggest a comparison 
between the conclusions reached in this report and the course of events in education during the inter- 
val. I found, however, that the written replies sent from America in answer to this question were 
‘not very helpful. 621

entirely different plan. Taking in order the topics embraced by the royal commis- 
sion as sketched in the ‘Memorandum by the chairman, an outline of the order in 
which topics may usefully be dealt with in the report,” I have gathered together 
the evidence which American experience seems able to supply, keeping in view the 
situation of affairs as we find them at this moment in England. I have given a num- 
ber of references to documents which have been offered to me on every hand in my 
journey, and which a longer time would have enabled me to make more use of. The 
greater part of my time has been spent in interviews with teachers, to whom I was 
introduced by letters from members of the commission before leaving England, and 
by their aid I was enabled to meet with others whose experience and judgment are 
appreciated in their own neighborhood. I may add that my inquiries have not been 
confined to teachers and professors; I have found it very profitable to meet State 
officials, superintendents and secretaries of boards of education, as well as lay mem- 
bers of such boards, and my impressions have been assisted by conversation with 
men and women who have no direct concern with the management of education, 
with merchants, with ministers of religion, and with parents of children attending 
schools. Here and there I have also had the advantage of meeting English scholars 
now scttled in American colleges or universitics, and I have found not a few Ameri- 
ean teachers who have familiarized themselves with our English methods and who 
are able to offer valuable poinis of comparison between the plan of organization 
pursued in the various countries of Europe. 
I ought to add that I have everywhere met with a most cordial welcome, and the 
greatest pains have been taken to put me in possession of every kind of information 
that I sought, and I have therefore been able to prosecute my inquiries more rapidly 
than would otherwise have been possible in the few weeks at my disposal.! On my 
arrival in the country on September 23, I first visited Washington and Baltimore, 
and spent several days with Commissioner W. T. Harris and his assistants in the 
Bureau of Education (see p. 636); since then I have visited, in order, Philadelphia, 
New York, Boston, and Toronto, spending a week or more in these cities or in their 
neighborhood. 
It is, perhaps, necessary to emphasize the point of view from which the pages that 
follow are written. If they give the impression of a disparagement of our English 
education at the expense of what I have seen in America, this impression will be due 
to the aim which has been set before me. I have not attempted a critical estimate 
of American education; I have sought to exhibit some of its merits so far as these have 
a bearing upon the admitted deficiencies of secondary education in my own country. 
2. I propose, firstly, to indicate from the experience of America the kinds of sec- 
ondary schools which appear to be needed in a complete public plan of education; 
secondly, to discuss the nature of the authorities, local and central, who should 
administer these schools, and therewith the distribution of their functions in rela- 
tion to endowed and private schools as well as public schools; on which will follow 
the discussion of one or two special questions which seeni to need more detailed 
treatment, such as the financial maintenance of schools, the entrance, and the leav- 
ing certificate. A separate section has been devoted to the training of secondary 
teachers. Within this scheme I shall be able to refer to the nine questions in the 
“Heads of information,” and to include the ground covered by the ‘“‘ Memorandum,” 
so far as the experience of Canada and the United States seems to be of service. 
1It would be ungracious of me not to mention the following, to whom I have been very specially 
indebted: The Hon. W. T. Harris, United States Commissioner of Education; Prof. Edmund J. 
James and Dr. Devine, of the American Society for University Extension, Philadelphia; Prof. Frank 
Morley, of Haverford College; Prof. N. M. Butler, president of the Teachers’ Training College, New 
York City; Principal Ray Greene Huling, of Cambridge, Mass.; Professor Buell, of the Boston Uni- 
versity; Dr. Melvil Dewey, secretary to the regents of the University of the State of New York,

REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 623 
Section I, 
. 3. Before entering upon these subjects, I desire to offer some general observations 
with reference to the principles which are at stake in the establishment of a system 
of secondary education. The contrast between ourselves in England asa people and 
the English race in America across the ocean lies mainly here, that in the most pro- 
gressive States of America the people believe in education, and are willing to make sac- » 
rifices for the sake of their creed. I do not think that anyone who has gone about 
among American schools and seen the mode in which they are supported and contin- 
ually extended could doubt that this faith in education is genuine and is distinetly 
characteristic of the most progressive parts of the country. 
If it were not outside the purpose of this report it would be easy to trace the origin 
and the growth of this idea from New England, where it had its birth, to the West, 
which has been created largely by emigrants from New England, and, since the war, 
to the Middle and Southern States, where the same faith is being slowly acquired. 
Now this belief in education has had two effects. Firstly,in the refusal to limit 
public schooling to the rudiments of instruction; the high school equality with the 
primary school has been recognized as a part of the public plan of education. I 
have taken considerable pains to inquire whether the press or the people show any 
signs of objecting to the heavy school taxes which are required to support high 
schools; and, except in a few instances, I have always received the same answer— 
the common people believe in free high school education; every parent hopes that 
his own child may be clever enough to be advanced to the high school, and perhaps 
_ afterwards to college, and the idea that secondary education is only for the well- 
to-do gains no foothold. Everywhere in the United States where I have traveled 
the schocl tax is the most popular of all the local taxes, and in the Northwest its 
range is extended even beyond the high school to the support of State univer- 
sities.1 
Secondly, outside of the scheme of public education, we have presented in the 
United States an almost prodigal liberality in the establishment and support of 
private educational enterprises. On every hand colleges and universities and tech- 
nical institutes are bountifully supplied with the gifts of rich men, and it is evident 
that this stream of wealth is the result of a national sentiment in favor of educa- 
tion. We have no parallel to this generosity either in England or in any other 
country.” 
In a later paragraph I shall recur to the question of private endowment. 
I desire to emphasize the importance of this abstractidea of faith in education, for 
it appears to me to indicate the only right basis for a public system of higher edu- 
cation. Our present system in England las been hitherto based upon another prin- 
ciple. We have seen that a minimum of elementary instruction, for children who 
can not obtain it otherwise, is necessary to national safety and progress, and must 
be imposed by authority and paid for by the public, as we pay for police and sanita- 
tion. Such a system needs to be either wholly administered or, at any rate, strongly 
controlled by a central authority, and such a system may properly be limited to the 
few branches of instruction which will achieve the aim desired. But itis wholly 
different with a nation that has learned, or is beginning to learn, its own need; the 
people of such a nation are competent, each in their own locality, to discover and 
supply their necessities, and they will refuse to limit their needs by any elementary 
code; they will vote for and will maintain many forms of secondary education for 
  
3In the West, however, tho tax is comparatively light, because a large sum is appropriated tc odu- 
cation from the proceeds of public lands. : 
2.At Harvard £70,000 per annum is regularly expected as a fresh endowment, and all the successful 
colleges of the Eastern States look to similar bequests in order to keep pace with the continually 
growing demands of educational development.

  624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the public benefit, and they will adapt these institutions to their local needs far better 
than any central authority can do it for them. 
Now, it is quite another question whether this belief in education is justified by its 
results, whether, that is to say, the money and time devoted to the higher instruction 
of a large number of young men and women is really well spent, and the problem 
presented is the one proposed in question 6 of the heads of information. ‘It has 
been said that the secondary schools of the United States turn out a large number of 
scholars whose circumstances would lead them to earn their living by manual labor, 
and particularly by agricultural labor, but who are unwilling or unfitted to do so, 
and have little prospect of finding congenial employment. How far, if at all, is this 
statement true?” 
Now, the idea that young people can be overeducated seems to be wholly alien to 
the American way of thinking, and unquestionably the evils which are supposed 
to result from overeducation in Europe are not found in this country, for the social 
and economic conditions of American life-are wholly different from those of Europe; 
and again, since education in America is a product of ‘‘the people,” it has been 
rapidly adapted to the people’s needs. 
By economic conditions, I mean that immigrants do a large portion of the manual 
labor, and that the labor which is not performed by hired help is not regarded as 
beneath the dignity of a man or woman who has received a highereducation.! With 
us in Europe, to be highly educated means to be brought into a higher social atmos- 
phere, into a class which is dependent for manual aids upon lower classes. In 
America, the tendency in this direction is of course observable, but not to anything 
like the extent as among ourselves, and thus the highly educated man or woman is 
not necessarily drawn into another social sphere, but is regarded as being better 
fitted for those pursuits in life to which he feels naturally attracted. If the Ameri- 
‘ean boy does not take kindly to day labor in the fields, it is because there are plenty 
of other people brought into the country to do that work, and he prefers to gain an 
education which will give him ‘directive power”? in a more intelligent walk of 
life. If, after his education, he returns to agriculture, he will not work on his farm 
as a day laborer, but he will direct machinery or direct the work of others. 
The above is an argument which applies to a new country more than to an old 
country, but the second argument will apply equally to any country. The American 
tells us that we can not give our children too much education, but we can give them 
useless education; and America illustrates more than any European country the need 
for continually adapting our curriculum ® to the necessities of the times. No country, 
for example, has developed more rapidly or more successfully the method of manual 
training,‘ first by means of the kindergarten in the primary school and then by man- 
ual training departments in the secondary school, and by every kind of scientific and 
technical department in the university. This movement is now in course of develop- 
ment, and has proceeded with the greatest rapidity during the last five years. Pro- 
fessor Hinsdale, of Michigan, in replying to the commission on this question, looks 
to the cure of the evil, not by closing the high school doors to the laborer’s child, but 
by preaching everywhere the real nature of education, and by convincing parents   
1 Numbers of students in American universities pay the whole or part of their expenses by labor, 
such as typewriting, printing, taking care of lawns, ete. See Catalogue of the University of Minne- 
sota, p. 55. This is the caso not only in the West, but at Harvard and Yale. 
2This is a phrase given me by the Commissioner of Education, Dr. W. T. Harris, who looks to the 
development of this ‘‘directive power” as ono of the main purposes of higher education: 
‘In European countries it is still held by most teachers that there is, or ought to be, a fixed formal 
plan of studies which should achieve the ideal of secondary instruction for every child, regardless of 
his future calling in life, or evenof his tastes. In America this mode of thinking is not often found. 
(Vide Report of the Committee of Ten, p. 53, Bureau cf Education, Washington, 1893.) 
4¥For the latest information on manual training we have a voluminous report by a commission 
appointed by the Massachusetts State board of education. Ihave given their recommendations in an 
appendix.

\ 
and the public of the benefits which good practical education will bring with it, not 
only for success in business, but for the higher pursuits of life.! 
There is another country exhibiting tie same firm belief in education which 
we find insome of the States. I refer to Germany; and in Germany I venture to 
believe that the charge of overeducation is justified. I think there can be no ques- 
tion that there are too many men in Germany who have received an education 
which opens the doors to a few select pursuits and which closes the doors to many 
other pursuits. There are far more teachers and doctors and lawyers in Ger- 
many than the country can find work for.2. I venture to think that this con- 
dition of things can only be prevented by placing the control of higher education 
more and more in the hands of local authorities and by relying upon the people them- 
selyes; unless this is done educational ideals will be set before the schools which 
have no correspondence to the necessities of life. The American secondary educa- 
tion no doubt fails to create as many scholars as we find in Germany, but it does 
start an interest in culture; it trains boys and girls to self-support and activity, it 
brings them into contact with social and civic life, and it leaves them with a freedom 
of motion which enables them to find a sphere and occupation in life where the young 
man or woman trained in the German school is comparatively helpless. 
Hence the conclusion is reached that, while elementary education may prop. rly be 
imposed upon a nation, public education of the higher type ought only to be organ- 
ized in response to the people’s demand, and hence it ought to be mainly under pop- 
ular local control. 
4, The whole problem of education is one which is only to-day beginning to be the 
subject of scientific treatment, and hence we can not hope for finality in schemes for 
the readjustment of national education. While we find in other professions a fair 
consensus of opinion on means and methods, in education no such agreement can be 
found. -Every conceivable variety of practice is employed in different parts of the 
world, and even in different parts of the same country. Now, the present century 
has witnessed in every part of Europe the establishment of school systems, more or 
less complete, creating permanent means of operation by which the child is to be 
prepared for life. These schemes vary very much in the extent to which they control 
the individual school or teacher, but they all tend in the same direction, to fix the 
forms of a school by the machinery of law or code. Such a mode of procedure was 
inevitable at the outset both in countries governed by a strong central authority and 
in countries like England, where the desire for local independence was strong, but 
where the national sentiment in favor of education was weak. But in America we 
have a striking contrast; in place of the codes and systems of Europe every locality 
is master of its own educational machinery, and hence it is possible for new methods 
and ideas to have some chance of being tested by experiment. Up to the present 
time it is probable that the results of American education, conducted on the popular 
plan and with little oversight from higher authorities, are poor compared with the 
results obtained under a good European system; butit is a different question whether 
   1 As an evidence that America was not educating too many high school boys, Dr. Harris showed mo 
the results of an inquiry made by him when superintendent of St. Louis, to discover the positions in 
life held by the ‘graduates’? from these schools. ‘To these boys education had simply meant so much 
inereased capital to invest at high profit in a business or professional career. The problem is one 
which is capable of scientific statistical treatment; an attempt at such treatment has been made by 
the director of physical training in Boston (Report to school committee; school document No.8, 1894), 
based upon Dr. Farrar’s Vital Statistics (London, 1885). ; 
2In Ontario I found that the same complaint was being made. The rural high schools are said to 
have given to farmers’ children an education ‘above their station,” and they have deserted the country 
to como and live in the towns. So long as a stream of immigration supplied their places with new 
agricultural laborers the harm did not appear; but there is little immigration now and trade is bad. 
The remedy for this is surely not to close tle rural high schools, but along with the general edu- 
cation to teach practical arts and branches of instruction connected with farm life having a close 
relation to the future calling of country boys and girls.
-P-A-G-E-684
    626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the ultimate result may not be better. It is, atany rate, very clear that if our present 
imperfect knowledge of education be once admitted the United States has a better 
opportunity of discovering and developing new pedagogic knowledge owing to the 
very want of system which characterizes its education.! The problem seems to be 
to organize a scheme which shall hinder inefficiency and waste without hindering 
the development of educational ideas. 
In the first half of this century Germany was the great field for the production of 
educational ideas—Pestalozzi, Froebel, Herbart, and a host of others were free not 
only to meditate upon theory, but to test their ideas by the practice of the school. 
Since the strict establishment of the German school systems, these men have had few 
successors; and the best fruit of their labor is being inherited, not by Germany, but 
by Englandand by America. » The kindergarten, for example, was banished from Prus- 
sia because the Prussian authorities did not approve of it, and it is only in these last 
two or three years that it has found recognition with the English education depart- 
ment; but in America it was easy for a single progressive town or city to make 
experiments with the method, and still easier for the success of such an experiment 
to lead to its adoption elsewhere.? I am convinced that there is in the minds of 
American teachers a desire to learn about education, a humility with reference to 
their present knowledge of the subject, which contrasts favorably with the attitude 
of the successful teacher in European countries. No doubt this humility goes along 
with a considerable amount of boastfulness about the results already achieved, and 
a conceit which is often not justified by the results; but this tendency to self-lauda- 
tion does not hinder the eager desire to learn from every quarter. 
5, These two observations lead to a third, to which I have already referred: That 
education in all branches, elementary and higher, ought, so far as is consistent with 
its aims, to be directed by local authority, to rely upon local support, and to appeal to 
acentral higher authority only within very guarded limits. Fortunately, in England 
we have experience which justifies us in enunciating this principle. I take it that 
one reason why local authorities were given such large powers in the administration 
of the technical instruction act was because it had been found that our school boards 
had administered efficiently the more limited powers given them by the act of 1870; 
and in America I have found no one who desired to see “‘ the people” deprived of the 
great authority which they possess over the administration of education, although 
the weakness of the United States system, which lies in the lack of a State central 
authority, is usually admitted at the same time. I propose in later paragraphs to 
deal with the problem here presented in detail. Here I wish merely to emphasize 
the principle to which, as I know, most English teachers are opposed, that secondary 
education needs popular control and popular support, if it is to achieve its aim. 
Those who distrust local boards of education for fear of their ignorance of the 
subject, forget the rapidity with which knowledge on public questions is now com- 
municated from place to place, and the ease with which those who desire can inform 
1« Our system has a tremendous and overflowing vitality, which promises more for the future than 
the well-fitted machinery of England. Did you ever live ina country town during the week of a 
teachers’ institute? It is a greater attraction than the new railroad or tho circus. The air is satu- 
rated with educational questions. The teachers, often of the same social grade as the best of the resi- 
dents, are received into the homes and made the central features of the excitement. Better still, 
have you ever been to a State or national education convention? The discussions do not strike one as 
being in the least shallow or vaguely general. * * * Thus our country is permeated with educa- 
tional life. England does not know much of it. Her teachers do not read professional literature, as 
ours do. They do not communicate popular enthusiasm for education as ours do, although they are 
often more highly trained.”—President Sharpless, of Haverford College, on the Relation of the State 
to Education in England and America (No. 87, in publications of the American Academy of Political 
and Social Science). 
2See ‘‘ Annual Report of Bureau of Education, 1891-92,” for records of the increase of public kinder- 
gartens in American cities. It should be noted that, as a rule, the kindergarten teachers are trained 
especially for kindergarten work; it is not thought sufficient simply to give primary teachers a super- 
ficial acquaintance with Froebelian methods. 
 
-P-A-G-E-685

themselves as to the best available methods. The United States exhibits, even bet- 
ter than our technical instruction committees, the possibilities in the way of train- 
ing local authorities to understand educational problems. 
6. No forms cf education can be permanently established on a self-supporting 
basis. This principle, which is admitted in the case of elementary and of university 
education, has been denied in England in relation to secondary education, and it is 
true that in some cases in England successful, proprietary schools have been estab- 
lished which pay their way, and which even return a dividend to those who have 
subscribed the funds, but I believe it could be proved, by careful inquiry into the 
history of English proprietary schools, that the proprietary system is one which 
can not be regarded as a permanent type, even if it were desirable that it should be 
so. In America, as in Germany, no one dreams of establishing a plan of secondary 
instruction on a seale of fees which will cover the expenditure; either the public 
purse must meet the financial need, or men of wealth supply the place of State aid. 
There are, of course, both in America and Germany a number of private! schools 
which are self-supporting, and such schools have a most important function in a 
scheme of national education; neither in Germany nor in America do we find prudent 
educators who despise the work of the private school, or wish to see this form of 
education disappear. But their existence does not supersede the public duty toward 
secondary instruction and the necessity for the establishment, in every part of the 
State, of public institutions which will supply the national need. These institutions, 
however wealthy many of the parents may be whose children attend them, can not 
be maintained by school fees alone. They have not been so maintained in earlier 
days when the cost of education was confined to the provision of buildings, teachers, 
and text-books; still less can they be so maintained in these days when the con- 
stantly expanding demands of education call for costly apparatus, of which earlier 
generations had no conception. 
7. Yinally, America is perhaps the only country in which the following principle 
is clearly illustrated—the principle of the wnity of all forms of education, By this 
phrase I mean the doctrine that all institutions for educational work, from the kin- 
dergarten to the university, are part of the same system and need to be treated on 
the same general principles. Those who are engaged in this work are regarded in 
America as one body of teachers, whether men or women, whether professors in the 
university or teachers in the village school. The distinctions that have been made 
between the various types of education—represented by the term elementary, gram- 
mar, high school, and the like—are distinctions which only have a right foundation 
so far as they discriminate the various stages in the one educational process from 
childhood to manhood; so far as they have separated teachers into classes, they are 
the result of earlier imperfect conceptions of education which have an historical 
basis, but no basis in sound thinking. There is little in the nature of things to 
justify the barriers erected by school laws and by custom between one section of 
teachers and another, and I saw much in close intercourse with German teachers to 
make me regret that German governments maintain these barriers so firmly. I call 
particular attention to this doctrine because it has been reinforced by the move- 
ments which are now taking place in American education. Only the other day the 
most distinguished representative of the American educational world, President 
Charles Eliot, of the Harvard University, has taken occasion to enunciate this 
principle,’ in order, as he says, to enable his university to do its work more efii- 
ciently, from the conviction that all sections of education need to be coordinated. 
The method by which he and others in America are seeking to secure this mutual 
  
1T wish to use the term ‘'private” in the English sense, to indicate what, in America. are known 
as private adventure schools, that is to say, schools which are the private property of the principal. 
In America, however, the term “private” is used to indicate every kind of school which is not 
administered under the laws of the State.

  628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
understanding and cooperation is, not by setting on foot a detailed scheme of 
administration for the whole State controlled by a government department, but by 
seizing hold of those points of contact where primary, secondary, and higher educa- 
tion meet one another, and by inducing teachers in each of these sections to join 
hands to the achievement of their common objects. The same spirit is shown in the 
National Educational Association, which is probably the most influential society of 
teachers in the world, comprising all ranks of teachers, from the university down- 
ward. Its most recent task has been to set the various committees to work which 
have dealt with high-school curricula, resulting in the now famous Report of the 
Committee of Ten. On similar lines the Ontario Educational Association has been 
organized, with departments for kindergarten, primary, high-school teachers, inspect- 
ors, and trustees. They hold some sessions of their convention together and some 
in departments. (See Report of Minister of Education for 1892-93, pp. 110-115.) 
When this spirit of cooperation has once been established, it may be possible to 
develop a State system of administration which will provide a suitable basis for 
every type of school without hampering the needful independence of the teacher 
and of the local authority. 
At present the United States seems to be the only country in which the lines of + 
demarcation between elementary, secondary, and higher education are kept in due 
subordination. In Germany the separation between elementary and secondary 
instruction is absolute, and in all countries which have received their educational 
impulses from Germany we find a similar distinction. I venture to believe that the 
United States have not lost by following the other principle. In England our sec- 
ondary instruction, owing to its lack of organization, is in danger of losing its own 
standing ground. On the one hand, the elementary school system has encroached 
upon its borders by means of higher grade schools; on the other hand, the older 
universities control it at every point by means of written examinations. Our sec- 
ondary schools need to work out their own destiny, untrammeled on both sides, 
while cooperating closely with primary teachers and with university teachers. 
Section II.—The kinds of schools required and the work done by each. 
8. In my inquiries in America to determine the limits of secondary education, I 
found that there was no universal agreement on the subject; for the public system 
places under local control three types of schools—the primary, the grammar, and the 
high school, and the commencement of secondary instruction lies somewhere in the 
grammar school. The primary school gives a five years’ course of instruction up to 
the age of 9 or 10; the grammar a four years’ course up to 13 or 14, which is suc- 
ceeded by a high-school course up to 17 or 18; and in some cases the same local 
authority will add a college course or a normal school course, carrying on the educa- 
tion up to 20 years of age; and at no period is any strict boundary line drawn pre- 
scribing that secondary instruction shall begin at such an age or end at another. 
Since, for various causes, instruction in American schools has proceeded at a slower 
* pace than in European schools, a child who has completed the grammar school course 
at 14 has usually not advanced further than the European child who has completed 
the elementary course at 12; but, in order to reform this state of things, it is pro- 
posed not to commence the high school at an earlier age, but to introduce what are 
called secondary school subjects into the grammar school course.! Nor, as we have 
seen, is the distinction between elementary and secondary instruction maintained by 
a separate classification of teachers such as prevails in European countries. A large 
number of teachers in American high schools are women who have had a normal 
school training, and who have afterwards taught in primary or grammar schools, 
before taking a class in the high school. A school board, managing a number of

Educational Association, Washington, Government Printing Office, 1888).

  REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 629 
city schools, may appoint either primary teachers or teachers who have been edu- 
cated at college; a most important work in secondary schools is done by ‘college 
men,” but there is no law which creates a distinction between one class of teacher 
and another. Hence the term ‘‘secondary” has only a vague signification in America; 
itis used in the Bureau of Education! to cover all schools above the grammar school, 
and Dr. Harris has made a distinction between primary and secondary education for 
the purpose of his reports, similar to the distinction which prevails in European 
countries. He holds that primary instruction should be regarded as ending with a 
knowledge of the language, history, and geography of the home country, of arith- 
metic, and the first beginnings of natural science, and he terminates this period of 
study with the American grammar school; but, as we have seen, it is one of the 
objects of reformers at the present moment to ‘‘enrich the grammar school course” 
by introducing higher subjects, such as foreign languages, algebra, physics, and the 
like before the child enters the high school. 
I have inserted the accompanying plan in order to illustrate the differences between 
several countries in determining the limits of secondary instruction. The United 
States and Ontario make the three grades of education consecutive. In Germany 
and in France elementary and secondary teaching overlap for.some five or six years; 
in England the two courses run on different lines from the beginning.? I attach 
importance to the question of the inferior limit of secondary education, because 
it involves a determination of the financial support which should be given to sec- 
ondary schools. If we presume that many secondary schools now existing may be 
supported in the future, or new schools may be aided, on a method similar to that 
of the technical instruction act, by grants of public money, the question will be 
raised, whether, in apportioning such grants, allowance should be made for children 
under the limit of age at which it is decided to distinguish secondary education from 
primary education. On the American plan our legislation would classify the kinder- 
garten and the preparatory departments of our present grammar and high schools 
as a section of primary instruction, and would presume such children to be in pri- 
mary schools up to the age of 14. On the other hand, the German and French sys- 
tem, while permitting the child intended for a secondary school to commence in the 
primary school, takes him away from the latter after two or three years, in order to 
prepare him separately for a special course in after years, and in England the sec- 
ondary school does its work entirely apart from the primary school. 
The American plan is democratic, for it delays as long as possible the division 
between the child intended for the university and the child intended for the work- 
shop; the German plan tends to narrow and specialize its education at too early an 
age. My own opinion is that it would be better for all our English children tobe edu- 
cated together in the primary school until the age of 11 or 12, no secondary instruction 
being recognized by law before that age. The English practice of absolute separa- 
tion has surely been injurious both to primary and secondary instruction; the edu- 
cation of young boys and girls in our endowed and private schools is the least 
satisfactory portion in the whole field of secondary education. ‘In this, as in many 
other problems of politico-social investigation, we,are able to learn from our Greater 
Britain the trend of popular impulse among ourselves, and to forecast the conditions 
which are likely to environ us in time to come. If there is no valid reason in the 
nature of secondary education for separating the child of the professional man from 
the child of the workingman in the first years of school life, we may be sure that 
“the people” (to use the American phrase), as they gain a stronger voice in the con- 
trol of national education, will not encourage this separation. 
There is only one valid reason why a family of culture should object to permit its

21t is true that a considerable number of primary school children are now going forward at about 
the age of 12 into the grammar schools of large towns and into higher grade board schools, but this is 
only a recent innovation, and is confined at present within small limits. (See plan opposite.)

children to sit side by side with the children of a lower class—the fear of moral con- 
tamination. This reason prevails in those parts of the United States where such 
contamination is to be feared—for example, in the large cities into which low-class 
immigrants are constantly pouring, and in many parts of theSouth. Under such con- 
ditions educators can only combat the mischief by training teachers who will 
understand how to watch over the habits and character of the little ones. Apart 
from such fear of contamination, it would surely be of benefit to the nation at large 
if our little children, of the rich and of the poor, in villages and towns alike, could 
be gathered in infant classes and set out upon their life’s journey in company. 
At the other end of the scale there is very little difference of practice between 
England and elsewhere. The superior limit of secondary instruction is determined 
at about tho age of 18 or 19. In America it is often lower, but this is because the 
arrangements of the college and university are of a special kind which is not found 
elsewhere, and to which I need not further allude. 
9. In comparing types of secondary schools provided in England and in America, 
we find that in England we have nothing corresponding to the American high school, 
and I believe that a large gap in our educational system would be supplied by pro- 
viding schools of somewhat this type in England. The characteristic features of 
them may be described as follows: 
(a) They are governed by the same scheel board that governs the primary schools 
and are supported from the same funds. 
(b) They admit children by entrance examination after completing the primary 
and grammar school course, and carry on their education so long as the parents 
wish, sometimes until they are ready to enter college, but more often up to about 
the age of 16—that is to say (to uso our English phraseology), many of them are 
first-grade secondary schools, but most of them are second-grade schools. 
(c) They are found almost every where, in the country as well as in the large towns, 
as an integral part of the public school system. 
Perhaps the most encouraging feature to be observed in the development of Amer- 
ican secondary education in the last 20 years is the growth of small high schools in 
country districts and the desire of the people to have these schools and their willing- 
ness to pay for them. In New England such schools have been established for many 
years, but in the Middle States the movement is of more recent growth. Suchrural 
high schools no doubt lack many of the advantages of -a large city school, but their 
work is by no means to be despised.|. The boys and girls that attend them very often 
come from a distance of 3or4 miles. In Massachusetts the law now compels a town- 
ship which has no such school to pay for the conveyance of its high-school children 
to a school in the nearest township, and to contribute toward their education there. 
The curriculum of the rural high school usually includes Latin and a modern lan- 
guage, but scarcely ever Greek. The principal is very often also appointed the 
superintendent of the elementary schools in his township, and thus the work of the 
three grades of schools—primary, grammar, and high—is coordinated. Such super- 
vision is, of course, not sufficient by itself; as we shall see below, the lack of proper 
inspection is one of the main deficiencies in the American school system. 
The city high schools are usually large buildings, often containing hundreds of 
children. The schools of the city of Boston may be taken as a type of the rest. 
There is, first, the Latin school, which is distinguished from the rest by teaching 
Greek and offering special preparation for the university; there are the English high 
schools, which include Latin in their course, but pay most attention to mathematics 
and natural science, and there is the manual training school, which devotes half of 
its time to drawing, metal work, or woodwork, and the other half to mathematics, 
literature, and science. This last type of school is novel and has still many enemies,

but I have found that most writers on education in America have given it their 
approval.! 
‘In the United States these high schools are always free; in Canada a small fee is 
usually charged, but the fee is never so heavy as to prevent a poor boy from attend- 
ing, and I am told that it is possible to get a remission of the fee in cases of special 
necessity. 
The discussion on overeducation in a previous paragraph will have served to 
answer, from the American standpoint, the objection of free schooling. When I 
hhave asked an American why the son of wealthy parents should get his schooling 
for nothing, it has been pointed out to me that the parent pays a much larger pro- 
portion of the school tax than poor parents have to pay, and he adds that the high 
schools are really maintained by the wealth of the country for the benefit of all, 
rich and poor, who need them. 
It certainly appears that the question of school fees, as a consideration in the pro- 
vision of public education, has but small weight in a democratic country. In Ger- 
many fees are, as a rule, demanded even in the primary school; but in every stage of 
education parents who privately give evidence that they can not afford to pay the 
fee have it remitted to them. When once it is granted that secondary education can 
not be self-supporting, and when it is further granted that children of promise ought 
to be encouraged to mount the educational ladder, there seems little reason for 
embarrassing the school organization by a complicated system of fees.?, Our English 
system of remitting school fees by means of competitive scholarships presents many 
undesirable clements which our foreign critics are more prone to deplore than Eng- 
lish teachers are to admit, It is sometimes overlooked in England that the parents 
of poor children are not likely to keep the children at school longer than is necessary, 
even if the secondary schools charge no fees at all, for the burden of maintaining 
the child at home in place of sending him into trade is a serious deterrent unless 
both tho parents and the child are willing to make sacrifices. What I have seen 
and learned of the American popular high-school system convinces mo that our Eng- 
lish people ought to have liberty to tax themselves for such an object, and ought to be 
encouraged by State aid to establish high schools for themselves wherever a popular 
demand for them arises. It is characteristic of the American system that these schools 
are placed within everyone’s reach; it is considered worth while to establish a high 
school in a township, although only 40 or 50 children are likely to attend it. 
There are no statistics in America to enable us to determine what proportion of 
secondary school children are in boarding schools; but I imagine it does not rise to 
more than 5 per cent, while in England we have at least 50 per cent in boarding 
schools. It is held by many English teachers that it is an advantage to the child to 
be educated away from home, but looking only at the matter of cost, it is clear that 
the English parent pays many times more for the boarding school-education of his 
children than the American pays in the school tax which provides for the high-school 
education of his children. I do not feel at liberty in these pages to discuss the con- 
troversy of the boarding and the day school], but I think it will be generally conceded. 
that there is a demand among English parents for good day schools, and there are 
some eminent teachers who hold the opinion that the peculiar educative features of 
our good boarding schools can be in a measure grafted upon the day-school system.® 
10. Outside of this public high-school system, we find in America all the types of 
English secondary schools except the proprietary school. I have inquired again and

of reports I have included accounts of somo manual training schools and papers relating to them. 
2If it is possible to speak of “tradition” in America, it would bo fair to say that there can be 
traced a tradition of free high-school education in America from tho time when the first grammar 
schools were established in Boston and elsewhere. ‘This was a tradition brought from England in 
days when free education was not so distrusted as it appears to be in the present century.

boys the benefit of tho house-tutor system.—Seo Journal of Education (London), September, 1884;

again in the Eastern States to discover whether there are any schools or colleges 
which are established on the joint stock plan and which pay dividends. I have found 
that occasionally schools have been established by means of shares, but in none of 
the cases of which I heard did the articles of agreement permit the payment of a 
dividend.! There are, for example, in Pennsylvania some dozen State normal 
schools established to give a boarding-school education to elementary teachers and 
to others. These were built by means of the subscriptions of people interested in the 
prosperity of their own neighborhood, and the State board of education gives them 
a helping hand. Half of the trustees are elected by the stockholders, half are 
appointed by the State board, but no dividend is paid. The whole of the profits are 
spent upon the improvements of the education. Endowedschools are of many kinds, 
but they bear a small proportion to the high schools. They are absolutely independ- 
ent of the State board, and if there are abuses in their management, no public 
authority is capable of correcting it; nor does such interference seem at present to 
be necessary, because their prosperity depends upon their being able to offer an edu- 
cation equal to that of the high school. The best of them, of course, being amply 
endowed with funds and charging high fees to parents, are able to give a better 
education than that of the high school, and these schools are known as “fitting 
schools” for Harvard, Yale, or Princeton universities. 
I have already pointed out that these schools, including the private-adventure 
schools, are all called ‘‘private schools” in America; and the question is sometimes 
asked whether the feeling in America is not growing in favor of private schools as 
opposed to the public-school system.? I discussed this question very fully with Com- 
missioner Harris, who, through his statistical bureau, is au to judge accurately of 
such a movement. He made it clear to me that the slight increase that had been 
observed in private schools some three years ago, although considerable in itself, 
was very slight by comparison with the immensely larger number of public schools, 
The disproportion between the two is entirely different from anything which we have 
in this country. The reasons for an increase in private schools in America, when it 
occurs, are special. (a) Parochial, Roman Catholic, or Lutheran schools will, in one 
State or another, be sometimes provided in opposition to the public elementary 
schools; and, indeed, the only opposition to the public school system of America 
vomes from the Roman Catholic Church.4 (6) In the cities an increase of wealth 
causes an increase of private secondary schools, for people of means often prefer to 
indulge their personal tastes in the education of their children; on the contrary, a 
period of bad trade sends the children back to the public schools. (c) When the 
public school system is notoriously inefficient or is deficient, then the private school 
supplies the need. 
“The private school provides for certain needs that the public schools can not or 
do not provide for in some localities. There is a margin, therefore, for this kind of 
education, and it is likely to increase slightly with the increasing wealth of the 
country. Probably its maximum limit is somewhere in the region of 16 per cent, or 
1 in 6, a limit already reached in some States of the North Atlantic Division. 
“The feature of the private school that causes its increase with the increasing 
wealth of the country is not so much that it provides for the separation of one 
caste from another, nor in that it provides for religious instruction within the limits 
of a particular denomination, but that it provides for exceptional cases. Wealthy 
people are able to gratify their peculiar notions as to the course of study and the

ing inquiry as to their success, financially or otherwise.

kind of discipline that they desire for their children. The private school depends 
upon personal or corporate enterprise. This enterprise is on the lookout for new 
subjects of study, new methods of teaching, an1 new preferences in any direction. 
It caters for special needs and tastes, offering new devices while they are in the 
doubtful stage of experiment. , 
“When the private schools have demonstrated the utility or general popularity 
of any new departure, the public school boards and superintendents gradually 
introduce the improvements into the schools supported by taxation, and the private 
schools lose the pupils that had been attracted to them by their specialties. This 
is the wholesome feature in the private schools; it saves the bulk of the school 
system from wasteful experiments. One need only think of the process now going 
on with reference to the kindergartens, manual training, physical exercise, cooking 
schools, natural science instruction, and such new movements which are slowly or 
rapidly gaining a foothold in the public schools. 
‘‘Again, the private school is a safety valve in many ways. When the school 
boards or school committees become niggard in providing good teachers and com- 
modious school buildings by a sufficient outlay of money in salaries and building 
funds, the best teachers are drawn off into the private schools. The majority of the 
people see this result with uneasiness, and a change is soon effected in the member- 
ship of the school committee by popular election. 
“On the other hand, capricious parents who furnish an element of perpetual 
friction so long as their children are in the public schools, find what they are seek- 
ing in the private schools, and can get the requisite variety by changing from one 
school to another as often as they like.”—(W. T. Harris, Commissioner of Education, 
in article Education in the United States, Shaler’s The United States of Amer 
I found that Dr. Harris’s views were, in the main, those of other teachers, includ- 
ing private-school masters, whom I once or twice had the pleasure of meeting. I 
have found no signs of antagonism between the private-school master and the publie- 
school master, such as sometimes shows itself in England; the place and function of 
both are recognized, and in the Northwest, where scarcely any private schools are 
to be found, the opinion is expressed that the educational system suffers by their 
absence. But, on the other hand, no one suggests that the private school system 
should be incorporated by means of State aid with the public school system; the 
distinctive virtues of the private school appear in its absolute independence of State 
control and State support. 
There has never been in the States a condition of things similar to what we find in 
England, where one-half of the secondary education is being undertaken by private 
school teachers, and it would obviously be a great hardship and injustice to estab- 
lish within a brief period a large number of public institutions, which would 
deprive these teachers of their bread. It would surely be possible to permit local 
school boards to establish high schools at low fees—subject, however, to the consent 
of some central educational authority, which would be-charged by the legislature 
with the duty of seeing that such injury to honorable private enterpriso was © 
avoided, or that the private teachers received adequate compensation; and, per- 
haps, as has happened in some parts of New England, struggling grammar schools 
and private schools might here and there be taken over into the public school 
system. 
It ought to be observed that the public high schools of America do not supply the 
whole demand for secondary education. In some quarters the people would not pay 
more than they are now paying in taxation; in other quarters well-endowed private 
schools already exist; but in the most progessive States the aim is always made to 
admit every child whose parents wish it to enter the high school, and the plan 
which prevails, e. g., in Philadelphia, by which grammar-school children can only 
enter the high school through a competitive examination, is condemned elsewhere. 
The distinction which we attempt tomake in England between first-grade, second- 
 
-P-A-G-E-692
  634 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
grade, and third-grade schools, is not regarded in America as so important, partly 
because every school desires to make the most of itself and dislikes to be classified 
as of lower grade than its neighbor. There is, however, a considerable movement 
in favor Of defining more strictly the scope of each kind of high school. 
I venture, then, to urge that our principal need in England is for a number of 
people’s high schools, mainly of the second grade, and of such low fees that the 
poorest children can attend if they will. Such schools will probably also be 
attended by the children from cultured fumilies, for the degrading influences which 
may come from contact with gutter children in the primary schools will not affect 
tho high schools, since such children will never rise beyond the primary grades. 
These high schools would offer curricula adapted to modern needs, not only for 
pupils intended for the university, but still more for those looking forward to com- 
merce and manufacture. And. not the least important of the functions of the 
American and Canadian high school is to give a secondary education to those intend- 
ing to teach in the primary schools.! 
Side by side with these schools the endowed schools would continue to flourish, 
and ought to look for support not only to State aid but to the generosity of the 
wealthy; indeed, I greatly doubt whether in England or America secondary educa- 
tion will be adequately supplied out of public taxation. Even the public high schools 
are now beginning to look to private wealth, through gifts of school buildings and 
libraries,? in order to supplement the public exchequer, and there is no reason why 
such gifts should not be devoted to public education as readily as they are given for 
a park or for a people’s palace. 
11. Here is the proper place to deal with the question of the coeducation® of 
boys and girls. There can be no doubt that the general public opinion in the United 
States and in Canada isin favor of coeducation. The immense majority of American 
boys and girls have been educated together at all stages of school life, and it is only 
here and there that exceptions are found to this rule. The Bureau of Education is 
now publishing a report on the question, containing the opinions of a large number 
of teachers and of well-known men and women outside the school, and it is clear 
that those who distrust coeducation are few in number. I am convinced, however, 
that this minority, although small, includes a number of very thoughtful and anxious 
teachers who have watched, perhaps with greater solicitude than others, the develop- 
ment of character in the young. I meta few such teachers. One, the principal of 
a New England high school attended by some 500 boys and girls, admitted that his 
position involved grave responsibilities, yet, on the whole, he thought that the 
advantages of coeducation outweighed the disadvantages, if the school were in the 
hands of conscientious and vigilant teachers; and, although feeling these anxieties 
for pupils during the high-school period—that is to say, betwéen the ages of 15 and 
18—he saw no serious danger in coeducation at college. On the other hand, I found 
that an ex-president of an important woman’s university realized the serious dan- 
gers in coeducation during the college period, but desired to see boys and girls 
educated together until they came to college. Hence I should conclude that a cer- 
tain amount of uneasiness among thoughtful persons is felt on the subject, especially 
in large cities, where children are less under the eye of parents than in the country; 
but that everyone, without exception, approves of boys and girls being educated 
together until their high-school age. The only possible objection to this plan might 
be found in very low and crowded neighborhoods, where children might come from 
vicious homes.

boys and girls in the same day schools, or in the same day classes? (2) What is your opinion of the 
working of the system, and as to the conditions most favorable to it as regards age of scholars, and 
size of school?”  
-P-A-G-E-693
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 635 
In view, then, of the possible establishment of high schools in England, I think 
American experience would at least justify us in establishing high schools for boys 
and girls together where a scanty population permit only of one school. In Canada, 
Ontario follows the American plan, Montreal the English plan, and I found that in 
Ontario the advisability of the American plan is scarcely disputed. 
Allied to this is the question of the employment of women or men teachers in high 
schools, and I venture to urge that it is almost as important as the question of coedu- 
cation. England is perhaps the only country in which it is the custom to exclude 
men teachers from a share in the education of girls, and America differs from Europe 
in giving women teachers a share in the education of boys. I found opinion in 
America to be somewhat as follows: It is advantageous for boys to be brought, to 
some extent, under the influence of women teachers during the whole period of 
school life, and for girls to be taught, to somo extent, by men teachers, No doubt, 
however, women teachers are employed too extensively in the teaching of boys,? and 
simply because they can be paid lower salaries; but the entire exclusion of women 
from boys’ schools would not be regarded with favor in any section of school work. 
The women teachers, it is said, usually excel in patience and steadiness of appli- 
cation to the details of school work, whereas men teachers are needed for organizing 
and directive power. My own conclusions, from what I saw in America, certainly 
confirm this estimate. I believe that if women teachers in America evinced more 
power in organization they would more frequently be placed at the head of large 
schools. 
12. It should be noted here that the primary and grammar schools and the vari- 
ous forms of the high school do not cover the whole range of city or county school 
boards. The attempt is made in most large cities to do something for the necds of 
special classes: («) For pupils who have special deficiencies—for example, the deaf 
and dumb, and the blind—and for disorderly children who are unfitted for the ordi- 
nary school. (b) For students desiring to be trained as teachers. Most largo cities 
have their own normal schools, although it does not follow that all the teachers of the 
city are required to have passed through them. (c) For the needs of technical edu- 
cation. The problem of technical education has received considerable attention in 
America, not indeed to the samo extent as in England or Germany, but valuable 
experience has been gained during the last ten years. The problem presents itself 
in twoaspects. Firstly, how shall the future needs of the child during its period of 
general education be allowed to modify the curriculum of the secondary school? 
Secondly, what provision can be made for technical education after the school age, 
and how shall the child be conducted from the one to the other? 
(1) In the American high school, as in the English grammar school, the demand 
for technical education has resulted in the substitution of technical subjects in place 
of Latin and Greek, or in the establishment of new classes, or new schools, in which 
technical subjects shall have the chief place. Formerly the future needs of the 
child in the secondary school were only studied in the secondary school with a view 
to prepare him for the university; but, as I have already pointed out, the multipli- 
cation of high schools in America, supported and controlled by the people, has led 
to the development of varieties of courses of study, which will suit the child 
intended for business or for manufacture. At the same time, this movement is only 
now in progress; and it is probable that the majority of American high schools still 
  
116 should bo noted that coeducation can be much more safely adopted in an educational system 
where children are educated together from the first years of school life, and where society, as in 
America, has become habituated to a less restrained and watchful attitude toward the association of 
young people of opposite sex. It would probably be unwise for a high school to educate together boys 
and girls who had not become accustomed to education in the primary school. 
?In tho States a mixed city high school will usually have about one-quarter of the staff men and the 
rest women; in Ontario the proportion is the other way.

offer a general education with no specific bearing upon the child’s future employ- 
ment. The movement in favor of differentiation is a new movement, and it is obvi- 
ously beset with difficulties, especially the difficulty of finding funds to equip the 
new departments and efficient teachers to conduct them; but the principle involved 
is now generally conceded, namely, that the secondary school can not adopt any 
general course of study to be universally prescribed as the best form of secondary 
education for every child, and that the educational ideal is not lowered or compro- 
mised by regard for the demands of the child’s probable career. 
As an outcome of these ideas, we have the manual training high school and the 
alternative courses of study drawn up by the committee of ten. These are the two 
most striking features in the development of American high schools during the last 
ten years. 
(2) The provision of technical education after the school age does not call for any 
special comment. Sometimes technical institutes, such as the Industrial Art School 
in Boston, are maintained by school boards, but, as a rule, this work is left to be 
done by private endowment. It is felt that technical education is a part of higher 
education, and higher education, except in the Northwest, is usually left to be pro- 
vided for by private endowment. There is, however, one great exception to this 
rule—the nation has endowed scientific agriculture by special grants from the Fed- 
eral Government.!

which may be given to each. 
13. The problem of school administration is complicated by the variety of author- 
ities and functions which have to be provided for even in the simplest system. We 
may tabulate as follows the various functions that are undertaken in America by one 
authority or another: 
(a) The erection and maintenance of buildings.—(1) Of schools; (2) of training col- 
leges, technical institutions, or universities. 
(b) Teachers.—Appointment; payment; issue of certificates, either temporary or 
permanent, local or general; and herewith posulpuone for the training of teachers 
and control of training institutions. 
(ec) School funds.—For salaries, for buildings, for libraries and apparatus, for teach- 
ers’ pensions, for text-books, for scholarships, for inspection and superintendence. 
(d) Inspectors’ and examiners’ functions, whether visitatorial or educational, in rela- 
tion to teachers, to pupils; their appointment and payment. 
(e) Pupils.—Terms of admission to the secondary from the primary school, and to 
the higher colleges and universities from the secondary school; by certificate, by 
competitive examination, by scholarships. Regulations to check truancy, and for 
taking an annual census of all children of ‘‘school age” in each district. 
(f) Codes and courses of study may be limited to a general plan, such as indicates 
merely the type and title of the school; or may prescribe an actual curriculum, or 
may impose a detailed syllabus with text-books. 
(g) School fees and text-books.—These may be supplied by parents or by public 
authority, and the text-books may be chosen by the school board or by the superin- 
tendent instead of by the teacher. 
(h) Regulation of the length of school studies, the school day, and the school year, 
and of vacations and single holidays. 
(i) Advisory functions.—Publication of reports, statistics, and accounts of educa- 
tional progress. 
I propose to discriminate between the various areas of school administration and 
to observe how these functions are distributed among them.

already sent to the commission, and it will be observed how carefully Dr. Harris dis- 
tinguishes the work of his department in contrast to that of an executive authority. 
Without itself undertaking any educational act,'! the Department assists others all 
over the States, both individuals and corporations, in the discharge of their tasks by 
supplying them withinformation. Its duties are, in fact, similar to those of the depart- 
ment of labor or those of the National Association for the Promotion of Technical and 
Secondary Education in England. One important part of the work of the Bureau is 
statistical, and every student of education in the United States finds his indebtedness 
to the material supplied by the annual report. This statistical work must, of course, 
be undertaken by the central authority of any nation which organizes education. 
Unfortunately the independence of the different States seems to make it impossible 
for the Bureau to compel the production of accurate reports, and, in consequence, some 
of the conclusions reached in the statistical department are in the nature of estimates 
rather than absolutely reliable conclusions. 
In addition to this statistical work, specialists are employed to inquire into foreign 
systems of education, and, in fact, the department may be regarded as a laboratory 
for scientific research in the field of comparative education.? 
And again, the Bureau is expected to watch the important educational questions of 
the day, and assist in their solution by means of its central position and distributing 
power. Thus in the last few years it has dealt with libraries, which are usually 
regarded as apart of the educational plan, and has published useful catalogues which 
may be employed by any local authority desirous of encouraging good taste in liter- 
ature. Recently it has made inquiries on the question of coeducation, and, as I haye 
already observed, is publishing a monograph on the subject. Last year, when the 
National Association took up the question of courses of study in secondary schools, 
the Bureau appropriately offered its services in assisting to collect material and in 
printing and publishing the report. 
This large field of labor is somewhat costly. The office receives an appropriation 
at present of £14,000 per annum. It is regarded as a subdepartment of the Depart- 
ment of the Interior. 
There are, it seems, two reasons which justify the expenditure of this large sum. 
Firstly, education in these modern days makes demands similar to those of commerce 
and agriculture and scientific research. Every worker in one corner of the field needs 
to be supplied with material collected from the experience of the country or of the 
whole world, in order to enable kim to work efficiently. Naturally this principle is 
admitted in the New World more readily than in the Old, for the newer countries have 
few traditions and are more ready to learn. 
Secondly, the principle indicated in paragraph 4 supplies a special reason for the 
study of comparative education. When once it is admitted that the whole range of 
education may be subject to criticism and reform, we are compelled to examine into 
every variety of educational enterprise in order to discover what records of success- 
ful achievement may be found which will help to guide our efforts. 
The following paragraph from the report of the Province of Ontario,3 which was 
  
1It does a little administrative work in Alaska, and also in relation to agricultural education; but 
this work lies beyond tho main purpose of the Bureau. 
21t may, of course, be questioned whether such investigation is properly to be included within the 
functions of government. On certain sides of it the work might be equally well done by the pedagogic 
department of a research university ; indeed, Prof. G. Stanley Hall, at Clark University, devotes con- 
siderable attention to comparative education. But 2 government oflice has advantages which no other 
organization can secure. 
®The Hon. G. W. Ross, minister of education in Ontario, permits me to say that his department has 
been frequently indebted to the work of the Washington Bureau of Education, and he has no question 
that an efficient department of the kind established in London, on an imperial basis, for tho benefit of 
education throughout the British Empire, would be regarded as a boon, and would receive support 
from the colonies.

  638 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
presented to the Columbian Exhibition, shows how our colonies have recognized the 
need for the study of comparative education: 
“The system of education in Ontario may be said to combine the best features of 
the systems of several countries. To the Old World it is indebted for a large measure 
of its stability, uniformity, and centralization; to the older settled parts of the New 
World for its popular nature, its flexibility, and its democratic principles, which have 
given, wherever desirable, local control and individual responsibility. From the State 
of New York we have borrowed the machinery of our schools; from Massachusetts, 
the principle of local taxation; from Ireland, our first series of text-books; from Scot- 
land, the cooperation of parents with the teacher in upholding his authority; from 
Germany, the system of normal schools and the kindergarten, and from the United 
States generally tho non-denominational character of elementary, secondary, and 
university education.” 
This duty of collecting statistics and reporting upon educational progress is not 
confined in America to the Bureau of Education; it is regarded as an important fune- 
tion of every State board and of all important city boards. Thus the superintendent 
of schools in Boston reports to his school committee :! 
“Tn bringing this report to a close, it may be well to advert in a few words to its 
main purpose, which is not so much to express a critical estimate of the matters 
touched upon as to communicate a mass of information concerning the history and 
present condition of our school work. This information is offered as raw material 
for the manufacture of views and opinions, or as a useful contribution to current 
educational discussion. Educational discussion is going on all the time, both in school 
circles and in the community outside; but there is no greater need than that discus- 
sion should proceed upon full and accurate information. Inasmuch as such discus- 
sion turns largely upon those features of the school system which are susceptible of 
improvement, the information thus drawn out is apt to wear the aspect of unfavor- 
able criticism; but it is unfavorable criticism in appearance only, the great underly- 
ing fact being that the system itself is strong and active and fruitful of good results. 
It is a sign of vitality and health in the system that it should be constantly mending 
its imperfections, mending them even under public observation.” 
I venture to urge that the education, and especially the secondary education, of 
England would be materially assisted by the establishment of some similar institu- 
tion. Obviously some central authority must collect statistics, if any progress in 
organization is to be made at all, and if the best use is to be made of these statistics, 
they should be taken in hand by educational experts, and it would surely be an 
advantage if the scope of such an office were imperial and not simply national. 
The following note from New Brunswick shows that our colonies would appreciate 
a service of this kind: 
“Tn tho course of the proceedings at the annual meeting of the New Brunswick 
Teachers’ Institute, the chief superintendent declared that it would conduce to the 
advantage of the colony if there were established at Ottowa an educational bureau 
under the direction of a man of the ability and enthusiasm possessed by the United 
States Commissioner at Washington. There was an ample field and abundance of 
work for sucha man and such an office without encroaching in the slightest degree 
upon the educational autonomy of any individual province. The generous mainte- 
nance of such a department by the Federal Government would tend to solve many 
knotty problems, and could scarcely fail to promote the educational work of every 
part of the Dominion. The proposal is to be commended, if only as likely to fur- 
ther that inter-provincial reciprocity in the acceptance of teachers’ certificates 
which the members of the institute desire.”? 
It may, perhaps, be doubted whether some of the material published by the 
1 Annual Report, 1392, pp. 63, 64.

Bureau, or by State boards of education, is worth the time and money spent upon it. 
No doubt there is some waste, more perhaps in the publications of State and 
municipal boards than in those of the Bureau; but I found that there were no two 
opinions among those I consulted in the United States as to the value of the work 
done at Washington, and of its direct benefit to all teachers, beth in public schools 
and in private schools, 
14, State boards of education.—Coming now to the functions of the State boards, it 
is to be observed how jealously each State preserves its own autonomy; and, since 
most of the States cover an immense area, and are continually increasing in popula- 
tion, there is no reason why its independence should be sacrificed, although, no 
doubt, the more backward States suffer from the lack of a vigorous educational sys- 
tem, and the independence of each State from its neighbor secures one great advan- 
tage which we in England have begun to reap since the technical instruction act for 
the first time gave power of independent initiative to county authorities. Each 
State learns by the experience, by the success or failure of its neighbor. An experi- 
ment tried in one State is certain’to be copied in others if it succeeds. The same 
benefit has been found in Germany, especially in the little States, where experiments 
can be more easily made than in a great kingdom like Prussia; particularly cities 
like Frankfort, or dukedoms like Sachs-Weimar, make experiments in educational 
reform, and the process is watched with interest all over the country. 
On the contrary, in a bureaucratic system such as prevails in Ontario, or in France, 
the individual teachers have little encouragement or opportunity to work out new 
experiments for themselves, and progress can only be made when the central 
authority is convinced of the utility of a reform which has been wrought out beyond 
its borders. 
It has, I believe, been suggested that England, for purposes of education, should 
be divided into some half-dozen provinces,! each including within its limits one or 
two of our universities or university colleges, and each of them competent to serve 
by itself as the largest area for the public educational authority. The experience 
of Germany and of America seem to show that a province or a State which is large 
enough to support one or two universities on the apex of the educational system is 
large enough for autonomy. 
15. It is generally admitted by thoughtful teachers in America that the State 
board of education is the weakest part of the educational system. The jealousy 
with which the township and the city protects its independence has hitherto pre- 
vented those functions which need to be administered centrally from developing 
proper activity; and, indeed, no clear conception seems yet to have been formed as 
to the precise duties which need to be administered from the center of the State, 
nor are serious proposals yet made to constitute an authority adequate to their per- 
formance. 
The State board of education is composed of politicians—sometimes nominated by 
the governor, sometimes elected by the legislature—and they have no claim tospeak 
with authority on matters of education. They employ an educational expert—the 
State superintendent?—but he is often appointed for political reasons, and is very 
seldom regarded as a power in the educational world.* 
The functions which, apparently, need to be administered from the central author- 
ity are, first of all, those which local boards are not competent to undertake, such 
as the training of teachers, the provision of higher education, and the inspection of 
  
1 Compare a similar suggestion in Fraser's report, p. 320: ‘‘A central board, exercising more or less 
of actual visitatorial power over the middle and upper schools within a given area—say a ‘ county,’ 
or one of those districts into which England is already divided by the registrar-general for statistical 
purposes.” 
20n tho office of superintendent, see p. 645. 
I am of course speaking generally. There are some notable exceptions; and, as I shall point ont 
later, there are two or three States which have a well-organized plan for controlling secondary educa. 
tion by a central authority.
-P-A-G-E-698
  640 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
schools;' secondly, those in which the cooperation of all local authorities is essen- 
tial; for instance, the arrangements for leaving certificates from the secondary school 
to the university. 
The functions of the State board in most of the States might be greatly extended 
if the board was so constituted as to carry weight with the local educational author- 
ities; that is to say, if it was composed largely of men of experience in school work, 
some of them elected by the teachers of various grades, others nominated by local 
school boards on account of their qualifications. In one or two cases the State 
school board has recently secured the services of eminent schoolmen; and I have 
observed, particularly in the State of New Jersey, the advantage which has been 
secured to the State as a result, for the work that has to be done by the school 
board is mainly professional in its nature, and needs to be administered, not by lay- 
men, but by men who have had experience in teaching. 
Many of the States possess a large State school fund, which is distributed among 
the schools, and it is given away without any adequate guaranty that it is going 
to be well spent. The inspection of the schools is left in the hands of local super- 
intendents, who are agents of the local school boards. The money is usually allotted 
on the basis of school attendance, the only additional requirement being that the 
schools receiving the aid shall be open for so many school days per annum. Some- 
times the grant is made conditional upon an equal amount being raised by local tax- 
ation, but even this provision does not prevail every where, and there are still school 
districts which spend no more upon their schools than they receive from the State. 
In one or two States special grants in aid are made to rural districts which are thinly 
populated and can not fairly be expected to support their own schools.? 
There are two States which present a striking contrast to the rest in this matter 
of State control. In New York State there has existed during the whole of the cen- 
tury a unique institution called the University of the State of New York, which is 
not, in the ordinary sense of the word, a university at all, but is a body charged 
with the control of secondary and higher education. The officers of this university, 
called regents, are elected by the legislature; but, owing to the important sphere 
intrusted to them, they are usually men of academic position, Under this authority 
asystem has been organized which exercises a most powerful influence upon every 
high school in the State. It possesses a school fund, which it distributes by a strict 
method of payment by results, the results being determined by a system of uniform 
written examinations on papers issued from the central office of the university in 
Albany. 
A somewhat similar system prevails in Minnesota, and in Ontario, Canada, where 
an examination for leaving certificates has been instituted for all high schools. On 
the result of this examination students are admitted to enter for university or pro- 
fessional education. 
In these cases we observe the manifest advantage gained by compelling the uni- 
versities and the schools to unite in the provision of leaving certificates, and, 
although I believe that the uniform written examination contains elements of mis- 
chief to education, it is obvious that the regulation of leaving certificates is one of 
the most important duties of the central educational council. 
If, in Ontario and in New York State, the central authority consisted of profes- 
sional men of similar rank to those constituting the chartered medical societies in 
England, it 1s likely that the leaving certificate would be arranged more in accord- 
ance with sound educational principles; but the advantage of securing by law an 
authority to regulate this matter for the whole State can scarcely be exaggerated. 
A similar observation applies to the work of school inspection of schools. 
Ontario, New York State, and Minnesota are once more distinguished from

by Professor Smart. of Indiana, published by the Bureau at the same time.

their neighbors by possessing a high-school inspectorate, independent of local 
control.! 
The lack of central control is also recognized in relation to the registration and 
training of teachers. It is true that the State boards of education everywhere 
authorize their superintendent to rant State certificates, but teachers are not com- 
pelled to obtain these certificates in order to teach in any school, The county or the 
city certificate is sufficient, and the result is that in many States the qualification 
of the teacher is appallingly low. This charge must be directed, however, against 
primary rather than against secondary education. B 
Speaking generally, then, the functions of the State board partly resemble those 
of the National Bureau of Education, partly are directed to aid, or to control in 
imperfect fashion, the work which is really done by each locality for itself. 
Nevertheless, most of the States have permitted the boards to undertake certain 
departments of higher education which special circumstances seem to have made 
advisable. Thus, most State boards of education have charge of a few normal 
schools; nearly all have established agricultural colleges, and in the Northwest we 
find State universities. In recent years also the boards have begun to control pro- 
fessional examinations by establishing diplomas for physicians and lawyers under 
the direction of State boards, and in time we may expect to see the State control 
extended so as to cover the whole ground of professional studies and of school 
inspection. So long as this control and this cooperation can be exercised without 
endangering the freedom of the teacher, it can not but be helpful to progress. 
16. For education, as for all the duties of local government, the State is divided 
into counties, and the county into townships.? In Massachusetts, and elsewhere, 
the townships had been formally divided into districts, each district being autono- 
mous and having trustees to administer its own little school; but experience has 
condemned the selection for the unit of an area so small as to include one or two

schoolsonly. The mischief gradually caused was pointed out in Fraser’s report, and 
is being thereby remedied by the legislatures of the States concerned. 
It seems to be generally agreed that the best area in rural districts for a school 
authority is one which contains enough primary schools to feed at least one small 
high school with pupils—that is to say, every unit of school government ought to 
contain at least one high school. Very often the high school in a sparsely populated 
district will only be attended by 40 or 50 pupils, but the existence of this school is 
sufficient to give a focus to the education of tho district, and to provide in the 
principal of the school a supervisor of experience, qualified to direct the educational 
work of the whole area. 
The board which governs such a school district or township is elected by the peo- 
ple, and possesses by far the largest share of authority, since the authority of the 
county board and of the State board above it is so weak. It ezects the school build- 
ings, appoints and pays the teachers, and in some cases is permitted to issue a 
temporary certificate to a teacher who has not obtained any certificate whatever 
from the State or the county. It receives, as we have seen, a grant of money from 
. the State, and must raise by local taxation whatever is needed to supplement this. 
It appoints its own superintendent for its schools, and, under his advice, it prescribes 
a curriculum and text-books. It also fixes the length of the school day and of the 
vacations and holidays; and it usually employs a truant officer, who is charged with 
the duty of collecting a census of all children of school age (5 to 15). Sometimes 
the census is taken by a county officer; in Toronto, by the assessors of taxes. In 
districts where a proper census is taken, it becomes a most valuable adjunct to the 
statistical material required in order to estimate the needs of public education. It 
not only enables the truant officers to find out children whose education is neglected, 
but it exhibits the share in education performed by private institutions. The annual 
school census seems to be a recognized aid to a thorough educational system. 
Between the township school board or committee and the State board comes the 
county board, which, as a rule, exercises an influence slighter even than that of the 
State board. Its functions are chiefly exercised by its superintendent, who examines 
candidates desirous of teaching and issues certificates which enable them to teach 
in schools within the county limits for alimited period of years. This influence over the 
teachers is extended by visits to the schools, by lectures at teachers’ gatherings, and 
especially by conducting the teachers’ institutes (see p. 52), at which all the teachers 
within the county are assembled. 
The county board reports to the State board upon the progress of education, and 
in some States has a voice in the distribution of the State school fund. Only one 
county normal school is known to me; it happens to have for its principal one of the 
most distinguished of American teachers. Usually the county board and its super- 
intendent are elected by popular vote; in New Jersey an effort has been made to 
enlarge the powers of the county superintendent, and he is appointed by the State 
board, and his tenure of office is more permanent. 
Speaking generally, then, the chief authority in the control of rural eahocie 
including rural high schools, is the smallest local authority, the district or township 
board. The authority of the county board and of the State board is extremely 
limited. 
17. From the scheme given on page 641, it will be seen that the city board of 
education is treated by the State as independent of the county, and it is, in fact, 
independent of the State board also; its subordination to the State board of educa- 
tion is merely nominal. It receives from the State school fund a certain appropriation 
per head for the education of its children; but in most of the States it pays back 
into the Stato exchequer a greater sum than it receives, because the property tax 
from which the school fund is obtained produces far more in the city than in the coun- 
try. In some States and cities,' however, property does not require to be seriously 
  
1 Chicago is an example; the particular sections of land set apart for school support happen to lie in 
the best part of the city, and their sale has created a most valuable school fund. 
 
-P-A-G-E-701
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 643 
taxed on behalf of the schools, because the public lands, which at an early date 
were set apart for the benefit of education, produce a large sum of money.! 
Some of the cities in the United States, where the people have displayed an earnest 
desire for good education, present most interesting fields of study. The school 
boards have taken pains to secure superintendents of high reputation, and under 
such guidance the instruction in the schools is transformed in very few years. Cleve- 
land and Indianapolis? at this moment, and St. Louis and Philadelphia some years 
ago, were examples of this mode of reform. A country with a bureaucratic system 
of control would never witness such reforms; nor, on the other hand, would cities 
indifferent to education be permitted to neglect their duty so shamefully as is often 
donc in other cities in the United States. 
18. The State board of educaticn is sometimes nominated by the governor of a 
State, sometimes elected by the senate or the assembly; and the superintendent of 
instruction is sometimes appointed by the governor or by the school board, or is even 
elected by popular vote. The variety of methods is due to a conflict of aims. The 
majority of the people desire to see education kept ‘‘out of politics,” and to secure 
members for these boards who are something more than professional politicians. The 
degradation of American politics makes it impossible for large powers in education 
to be intrusted to the nominees of the governor or the senate, although many times 
over I have been assured of the anxiety which is felt by the people themselves as well 
as by men of culture to seo education conducted without reference to politics. I 
have inquired whether it would not be possible to constitute some kind of educa- 
tional council, containing representatives of the teachers and of the universities, on 
lines similar to the organization in England of the medical or the legal profession, 
but apparently the time is not ripe for the professional organization of the teaching 
body. 
In New York State, where, as I have already said, secondary education is formally 
controlled by the regents, some slight power by way of advice is placed in the hands 
of a committee of presidents of colleges and of principals of schools, but this power 
is nothing more than advisory, and, as a result, I have the impression that the 
methods employed by the regents are not so wisely directed to the benefit of educa- 
tion as they might be. The regents, being specially intrusted with the care of 
secondary and higher education, are always highly educated men, but they are the 
nominees of the governor, and they would be more likely to represent the educa- 
tional wisdom in the State if some of them were chosen by their fellow-teachers. 
The functions of the county board are so slight that the mode of its appointment 
need not be described. The school trustees of the rural township are elected by the 
people, and their efficiency as an executive body varies greatly in different parts of 
the country. In New England, where traditions of good schooling are more than 
three hundred years old, the work will be efficiently performed, but in other districts 
the main object of the trustees is to keep school open with the smallest local outlay; 
in such districts, of course high schools are out of the question. 
The mode of appointment of the city board varies also; sometimes the mayor, some- 
times the judges, sometimes the city council, sometimes the people themselves choose 
the members. Everywhere the same desire is expressed to elect a board which will 
keep education out of politics, and the strenuous efforts made to achieve this end show 
how difficult a task this is. While city councillors are paid a salary, members of 
school boards are never paid; and yet there can be no doubt that in a hundred ways 
the machinery of the school board is manipulated to serve the baser ends of party 
politics in places where the sense of public duty is low. It is, of course, much easier 
to point to the disease than to prescribe a remedy. 
  
1 Chicago is an examplo; the particular sections of land sct apart for school support happen to lie 
in the best part of the city, and their sale has created a most valuable school fund. 
2Tho articles contributed by Dr. Rice to The Forum in 1892-93 afford a powerful, though it appears 
somewhat one-sided, criticism of city school systems in the United States.
-P-A-G-E-702
644 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
I haye inquired whether the plan of nominating a number of members of the 
council by cooptation from educated men in the community, not associated with a 
party, would be acceptable, but such a proposal, I am told, has never been made. 
In the few cities where a vigorous attempt has been made to check the evils of cor- 
ruption, it has taken the form of placing greater power in the hands of the superin- 
tendent of instruction. 
19. Turning back now to the functions mentioned in paragraph 13, which are under- 
taken by one or the other of these boards, we find as follows: 
(a) The State board or department of education generally establishes its own 
normal colleges, schools for special classes, such as the deaf and dumb, 
very often technical institutions, and sometimes universities, but beyond 
this range its authority in the erection and maintenance of school build- 
ings is very slight. Local authorities for rural or municipal areas have 
power to build and maintain both elementary and secondary schools at 
will, and no superior State authority controls either the building plan or 
the ventilation or other matters, which in England and Germany are 
supervised from the central office. 
(b) The local authority has absolute control over the appointment and pay- 
ment of teachers, The city boards issue their own certificates, while the 
rural boards are only allowed to employ teachers who are certificated by 
the county board; but this important task is very inefficiently performed 
by the county board, and the whole method of certifying and employing 
teachers is admitted to be unsatisfactory. The State board can issue cer- 
tificates, but the immense majority of teachers never trouble to apply for 
them. 
(c) Finance: 
20. (i) Provision of funds for schools—The township board can raise a local rate 
and also receives financial aid from the State board, or the county board, or both, 
and its aid is usually calculated merely upon the numbers in general attendance. In 
one or two States a system of payment by results has been instituted, and in some 
cases superintendents or inspectors are appointed at the State cost, but it is only 
here and there that we find the power that the State ought to exercise by means of 
its financial aid employed with real effect to encourage good education and to repress 
incompetency. The system sanctioned by our technical instruction act of giving 
grants of money to schools outside of the public school system is very rarely found 
in America, 
It has been noted above that secondary education is never regarded as self- 
supporting in America, and in theory every State regards itself as responsible for 
the provision of adequate secondary instruction; but it is only here and there that 
we find this obligation properly fulfilled. In many places if the public authority 
were called upon to provide school places for all children who are receiving second- 
ary instruction the task would be utterly beyond their powers, for private endow- 
ment has always been generous in aiding secondary schools where such schools have 
gained a footing; and where, as in the West, the whole field of higher education is 
being undertaken on the socialistic basis by the State, it is being found, as Iam 
told, that the State is unable to cope with the task, and it becomes a problem how 
to induce private donors to aid in this object with their wealth when the State has 
once assumed the entire responsibility of educating its children. The question is 
already causing anxiety in the State universities of the Northwest, and in England 
we shall have the problem before us in another form. At present, for reasons special 
to our time, very little endowment in proportion to the wealth of the country is 
forthcoming, either for secondary or higher education, but we may perhaps look 
forward to a revival of interest in the subject such as we are witnessing now in 
America. Now, if such a revival takes place it would be natural to expect a stream 
of gifts to educational institutions; but if the legislature undertakes education 
from the socialistic standpoint and endeavors to provide for all its needs out of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-703

public exchequer it may be questioned whether the flow of wealth from individuals 
will not cease.! The danger of arresting the stream of endowment is a serious one, 
and it suggests that public aid to secondary education should, so far as possible, 
take the course adopted in recent years for the support of higher education iu Eng- 
land from the exchequer; that is to say, by grants on a scale proportioned to the 
spirit of generosity displayed by the locality, leaving the control of the institutions 
mainly in the hands of the locality. The unfortunate result of attempting to sup- 
ply the whole educational need of a country through an educational department, 
relying only on public taxes, is exhibited in the Province of Ontario, in Canada, 
where the ministry, although inspired by an enlightened zeal on behalf of educa- 
tion, is unable to find funds to provide for the necessities of its higher institutions,? 
for its wealthy men have not formed the habit of contributing their aid, as is shown 
in other parts of Canada and in the United States. 
(ii) Expenditure; scholarships.—The promotion of education by means of scholar- 
ships, which continually receives new developments in England, is not favored either 
in the States or in Canada. Scholarships are found here and there, but the general 
sentiment is against their employment as a means of promoting education on a large 
scale. It is held that money spent in this way would be better spent in reducing 
the fees or in employing better teachers and better inspection. Indeed, the whole 
principle of stimulating either the teacher or the pupil by competition is distrusted. 
Pensions.—I have not found that schemes for teachers’ pensions are receiving 
much attention in America, the reason being that so many teachers are engaged in 
the profession for only a few years. Teaching is still to many men, as well as to 
most women, a temporary means of livelihood, which will later on be dropped. 
(d) Inspection: 
21. One of the features of the United States system is the employment by every 
school board of an expert, usually called the superintendent. He is the chief execu- 
tive officer of the State board, county board, city board, or township board. Some- 
times, as in Massachusetts, he is also secretary of his board, and very often in small 
cities or townships containing only one high school he is also principal of the high 
school. His position and duties may be best illustrated by contrasting them with 
those of Her Majesty’s inspectors of schools in England. 
(1) His appointment is not of a permanent nature; it has to be renewed every 
two, three, or four years; and districts are still found where the change of political 
parties will involve the dismissal of the school superintendent and his staff. Instead 
of being, as in England, the servant of the central authority, he is the servant of 
the local authority. 
(2) While the English inspector is only concerned with primary education, the 
superintendent’s control, like that of his board, covers the whole range of schools. 
Hence the creation in the States of a class of university men who become experi- 
enced teachers, familiar with all the problems that present themselves from the 
youngest school age up to the university period. 
(3) As the professional adviser of the board, the superintendent has a very large 
influence in the appointment of teachers. It is true that the principals of the schools 
are always consulted in these appointments, and the successful principal of a high 
school is permitted a large amount of independence,’ but it is the board that makes 
  
1 See paragraph 10, and note. 21 am not quoting the expressed opinions of the department, but it is obvious from a comparison of 
the equipment of the university and other institutions in Toronto with those in tho United States that the lack of means is seriously felt; the education department can not find funds to meet all 
requirements. Everyone in Canada notices the contrast between the generous support accorded, 
solely by private individuals, to MacGill College, at Montreal, with the struggling needs of the uni- 
versity at Toronto, which has been taught to rely solely upon the State. 8City boards usually appoint a small committee to manage the details of each high school, and the 
principal will usually be invited to its meetings—indeed, it would be difficult to transact business in 
his absence. If teachers in the United States were professionally organized, the principals of high 
schools would probably make a claim to attend such committees as a right. In Ontario I heard a 
complaint that high school trustees were acting without consulting the principal; in England the 
same difficulty has been felt, and I understand that the Head Masters’ Association has given atten- 
tion to the subject.
-P-A-G-E-704
  646 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the actual appointment, and if a difference aroso between the superintendent and 
the school principal the board would probably support the superintendent. 
Ihave talked with a number of high school principals as to the possibility of 
friction between themselves and their board or its superintendent, and I find that 
here, as in Germany, the position of a principal is very different to that of an Eng- 
lish head master; our head masters would certainly protest most vigorously against 
the limitations of authority which are imposed upon the principals of German or 
American secondary schools. But I am bound to confess that I see no reason why as 
good an educational result may not be produced on a system in which the prin- 
cipal’s authority is much more limited than it is among ourselves; the idea of 
undivided responsibility which attaches to the office of the head master is rarely 
found outside of England. The superintendent, however, does not “interfere” 
very much with the authority of his high school principals, because they stand very 
much on 2 level with him both in reputation and in salary. 
The course of studies for the high schools is issued on the authority of the board 
of education, but the principals have the main voice in putting it together. It is 
well understood that the influence of the superintendent upon instruction shall be 
mainly directed to the primary and grammar schools, which are in the hands of less 
experienced teachers, chiefly young women, who need more direction and supervision. 
(4) While the English inspector is limited by the instructions of the department, 
the superintendent, if he is a man of original educational ideas and is able to influ- 
ence his board, has the opportunity of making very great progress in the educational 
system of his district; and those cities and counties in which during the last few 
years there has been pronounced improvement are indebted to the vigorous initia- 
tive of the superintendent who, in some cases, has been specially summoned to come 
to the rescue of a city where the lack of good education was painfully felt.' 
On the other hand, a worthless superintendent will soon ruin the schools under 
his control, for there is no efficient check from a central authority. 
(5) In tho larger cities the efficiency of the superintendent is hindered by the 
mass of statistical and office work which the immense number of schools and teachers 
under his charge brings with it. He is supposed to visit each school and to be able 
to advise teachers in every part of the city; but the task is too great, and I have 
met one superintendent, who is ambitious to improve school methods, who deliber- 
ately left a city of 50,000 inhabitants to take the superintendency of one containing 
only 10,000 inhabitants, because he felt that he could only exercise effective personal 
influence in the smaller area. 
Some of the larger cities, such as Boston, appoint a number of assistant superin- 
tendents or supervisors, who take charge of separate districts, and thus the evil is 
remedied. 
If the claim of local authorities to a large power of initiative in education be 
once granted, it appears that some expert officer like the superintendent is necessary, 
and the employment by our county councils of an expert secretary to technical 
instruction committees seems an evidence in favor of this view. Without the super- 
intendency American education could not be carried on at all, and the defects of the 
system need to be remedied, not by abolishing the office, but by introducing more 
inspection and more superintendence from the central authority; this, one hopes, 
may be done without imposing, as in Ontario and New York State, a uniform system 
of simultaneous paper examinations. 
The inspectorate of New York State and of Ontario demands a little further notice. 
In New York State the regents have recently appointed 3 or 4 inspectors, with the 
conviction that the certificate paper examinations do not, by themselves, afford a 
sufficient test of the progress of the high schools, and in Ontario 2 high school 
inspectors have been appointed who spend their time in visiting the high schools 
under the department.? In both instances I found that the visits of these inspectors 
  
1 See paragraph 17 above. 2See Appendix I.
-P-A-G-E-705
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 647 
were welcomed by the principals of the schools, and the only objection to the further 
development of the inspectorate is its cost. 
In New York State one of the inspectors is specially qualified to advise on the pro- 
vision of apparatus for science teaching, and his services are placed at the disposal 
of schools which invite his assistance. 
It will be seen from the schedules which I have added as an appendix to this report, 
that the scope of the inquiry made by these inspectors is very wide, and enables the 
central authority to form an accurate opinion as to the condition of higher education 
in the State. 
I venture to urge that the provision of a public system of secondary education in 
England must carry with it a system of inspectorate from the central authority, 
and there seems to be little reason in the nature of things for establishing a secondary 
school inspectorate apart from the inspectorate of primary schools. An objection to 
such inspection is often raised on the ground that no one man, however talented, is 
sufficiently familiar with all the branches of study in a secondary school to be able 
to examine into the work of the highest forms. A detailed or formal examination, 
however, is not necessary to inspection; our head masters are able to control the 
work done in every branch of instruction; why should not inspectors be able to do 
the same? 
In addition to the central inspectorate, the experience of America seems to point 
to the necessity of local supervision on the part of an experienced superintendent or 
inspector serving under the local authority, who would give an impulse to that local 
activity which is likely to be suppressed if the whole direction of education is left to 
the central authority. 
22. (e) Terms of admission from the primary school to the secondary school, and from 
the secondary school to college.—No educational questions have been more keenly de- 
bated in the United States during recent years than those concerned with the passing 
of pupils from one stage of education to the next above it, and with reason, for upon 
a wise solution of these questions the efficiency of secondary instruction largely 
depends. 
Admission to the secondary scheol.—There are two opposite methods which are em- 
ployed by superintendents in promotion: 
Firstly, by simultaneous printed papers making up a primary school leaving exam- 
ination, imposed on all the pupils of a city or a district. 
Secondly, by the certificate of the principal of the primary school, declaring that 
the pupil has properly completed the primary course of study. 
The first method is similar to the university local machinery employed so exten- 
sively in England. The second bears more points of similarity to the leaving certi- 
ficates which are issued by every type of public school in Germany. I hesitate to 
offer argument upon the controversy raised by these two contrasting methods, partly 
because my own experience as an English teacher has led me to conceive what is, 
perhaps, a prejudice against the simultaneous written examination employed by our 
universities and secondary schools in England, and also because I have had no oppor- 
tunity in America of testing the work done under one system or the other. There 
has, indeed, been too much vague attack and destructive criticism upen the written- 
examination system, without any attempt to construct an efficient substitute. - This 
was the error made by Mr. Auberon Herbert and those who joined him in his famous 
onslaught in 1888.2 The practical problem is, how shall a trustworthy plan be 
devised to enable admission and leaving certificates to be issued on a large scale, and 
at a moderate cost, which will be acceptable to universities and the like, without 
  
1Compare Fitch, Memorandum, on the Certificat d’Etudes in France. I agree with him that 
this is a matter of the first importance, to be regulated by Stato control; but I think that we must look to 
Germany rather than to France for a wise method of conducting the examinations, if we are to avoid 
grave injury to the teacher's work. 
2 Nineteenth Century, November, 1888.
-P-A-G-E-706
    648 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
resorting to simultaneous papers, or incurring the grave injury to instruction which 
these involve? I believe that such a plan can be devised, and that Germany and the 
United States are showing us how to arrive at it. 
My opportunities of comparing English school work with German school work 
have been sufficient to enable me to state that German instruction, conducted and 
completed apart from simultaneous printed examination papers, is as efficient as 
English instruction, which is made so dependent upon this form of stimulus and con- 
trol. My observation in America has enabled me to note that strong efforts are 
being made, even by those who employ simultaneous printed papers,! to find a satis- 
factory substitute for them, and a recent investigation into the methods of promotion? 
seems to show that the simultaneous paper is employed to a much less extent than 
formerly. Indeed, the history in America of this mode of examination is similar to 
its history in England.’ It came into being as a cheap and convenient device, which 
could be readily employed to compel every teacher to raise his work up to a respect- 
able standard. As a matter of history, the system was introduced to cure idleness 
and inefficiency; but it can not do more than this, it can not point the way to better 
teaching, for the best results of instruction fail to be tested by the printed question 
paper, while it tends to encourage aims and methods of teaching which are unworthy. 
Apart, however, from the investigation of the right mode of examining, it is obvi- 
ous that the question of admission to the secondary school is one that needs careful 
attention from the authorities that organize education, and it is one in which pri- 
mary school teachers, as well as secondary teachers, ought to have some voice; and 
herein the United States claims an advantage, because the primary and the secondary 
schools are under the same local authority. 
In Ontario the whole system of certificates is administered by the Education 
Department, and the minister seeks advice when he needs it from all classes of 
teachers as to the character of the examination which he imposes. In New York 
State the regents impose their own entrance examinations for admission to high 
schools, and here, also, their power is unchecked; they are not compelled to follow 
the advice either of primary or secondary teachers. The advantages in these two 
States of a uniform system of certificates are undoubted, but it would surely be to 
the advantage of the schools if these certificates were issued under the authority of 
a professional council on which both primary and secondary teachers were repre- 
sented. In England the only attempts, so far as I know, that have been made to 
create a uniform standard of admission to secondary schools are those concerned 
with competitive scholarships,‘ and here the experience of America is in direct oppo- 
sition to English practice; no scholarships to high schools from grammar schools 
exist, because the high schools offer free tuition, and the endowed and private 
schools have never commenced such a practice. Sometimes a competitive entrance 
examination is imposed for admission to high schools, as in Philadelphia, and per- 
haps in other places where sufficient accommodation has not been provided by the 
board, but I found even in Philadelphia that this competition was not regarded with 
favor; indeed, I have not met with a single teacher in America who attached edu- 
eative value to the principle of stimulus by competition for scholarships, prizes, or 
certificates, and this is true of Ontario as well as of the States. 
  
Particularly in Ontario, where I found considerable effort being made to minimize the evils of the 
system; everyone regarded it as an imperfect plan, but they adhere to it until something better can 
be found. (See Memorandum for Principals of Schools, Circular 21, Ed. Dept., Toronto, January, 1894.) 
2Promotions and Examinations in Graded Schools, by Dr. E. E. White (Washington, Government 
Printing Office, 1891, Circular No. 7 from the Bureau). Dr. E. E. White has long been a recognized 
authority on education. (See Fraser's Report, p. 10.) 
#It may be noted in passing that, while the examination system in England originated in the 
universities and has by them been extended over the schools, the American universities give little 
place to examination apart from teaching. They maintain the German principle—that the teacher may 
be inspected as much as you please, but his pupils must be examined by himself in the matter and 
the form in which he has taught them. 
4I refér particularly to the examination now conducted in London, under the auspices, of the Head 
Masters’ Association, for scholarships from elementary to secondary schools.

23. Admission to college from the secondary school.—There does not appear to be any 
absolute necessity for a precisely uniform standard of admission from the primary 
to the secondary school in all parts of a State. One might conceive of local condi- 
tions where it would be better for the standard of admission to a high school to be 
lower or higher than in other neighborhoods; with regard, however, to the leaving 
certificate admitting to college, uniformity of standard is surely essential, and one 
of the most crying evils in our want of system in England is due to the multiplicity 
of examinations imposed by the different universities and the professional schools of 
Jaw and medicine. 
I may note, in passing, that very few students enter American universities without 
having been pupils in some secondary school,'i. e., very few prepare for the uni- 
versity by the aid of private tutors. Anything like the “‘ correspondence” method 
of obtaining a London degree is unknown in America. Dr. Harris happened to have 
made recent inquiries which covered this question, and I have given his figures in 
Appendix C, 
I have met with four methods employed for college admission: First, each uni- 
versity or professional school holds its own entrance examination, independent of 
every other authority. This isthe English plan. Secondly, the Government depart- 
ment holds a simultaneons written examination, which it requires universities and 
professional schools to accept as an entrance certificate. This is the plan employed 
in Ontario and New York State. Thirdly, the Government employs inspectors who 
are associated with the teachers of the school in a final examination, and they, in 
conjunction with the principal of the school, issue the leaving certificate which 
universities and technical schools are required to accept. This is the German plan. 
Fourthly, the university makes a general inspection of respectable high schools who 
wish to send pupils to it, and thereupon accepts the certificate signed by the princi- 
pals of such schools, without any examination conducted from itself. This is the 
plan followed in the majority of American universities, and is known as the Amer- 
ican certificate plan.? 
The last two alone give the teacher what, as a professional man, he has a right to 
demand, i. e., freedom to work out his curriculum according to his own method and 
views upon teaching. 
If the inspector in Germany, instead of being a civil servant, was, to some extent, 
under the authority of a professional council, it seems to me that the German plan 
would be almost perfect. 3 
The American certificate plan presents the obvious danger that pupils may be sent 
up from some schools without having reached the proper standard of attainment.? 
(f) Control of courses of study. 
24, English secondary teachers, who dread the introduction of State control, are 
inspired by the fear that it may impose upon our schools fixed courses of instruction 
similar to that of the primary school code. It is true that such courses, more strin- 
gent than any Government code, are already prescribed by the local examination 
regulations and papers of questions issued from the universities; but this control is 
not recognized as similar in its effects to that of departmental control, and our Eng- 
lish head masters still have left to them a large field of initiative which these exami- 
nations do not cover. 
The fear, however, that a State authority might centralize, in mechanical fashion, 
our secondary education is by no means groundless, for there is good reason to 
believe that those States which have adopted a uniform system of secondary instruc- 
tion have been in danger of depriving their teachers of freedom and of the progres- 
sive spirit; for it is the tendency of a central power to be seeking to stretch its

authority and to determine fixed modes aud forms of instruction, instead of recog- 
nizing that the educational aim can be realized in a hundred different ways. 
These departments of central control, in New York State, in Ontario, in France, 
and to some extent even in Germany, have been led to impose a stringent machinery 
from the conviction that it was impossible by any other means to check the abuses 
liable to arise in the schools. 
Ii may be admitted that our secondary schools need the hand of the State to give 
general direction to their work, but it would be a great disaster if it laid its hand 
too heavily upon them. It would surely be sufficient if the central authority were 
to determine in general terms the standard of attainment for pupils when leaving 
the various types of secondary school. It ought not to be necessary to prescribe any 
code or detailed curriculum; it may well be left for the local authority, guided by 
the expert advice of the head master or superintendent, to prescribe a detailed cur- 
rictlum or syllabus. Only in Ontario has the department gone so far as to prescribe 
text-books specially prepared under the authority of the department for the use of 
the schools; and I have gathered that this unfortunate provision is due to the desire 
for economy rather than from any real belief that the text-books provided by the 
department are better than other publications. 
(9), (k), () The distribution of these functions has already been referred to in 
discussing other matters. 
Lhave now dealt with the various departments of administration as they are reg- 
ulated by the various controlling authorities recognized in the United States. I 
have left one question for separate consideration, viz, the professional training of 
secondary teachers. 
Sucrion IV.—The professional training of teachers. 
25. In the United States the law forbids any school board to engage a teacher who 
has not obtained a county or a State certificate; but this certificate does not imply 
that the teacher has had a professional training, and university graduates intending 
to teach in high schools obtain the necessary certificates without further question.! 
It does not, however, follow that because professional training is a voluntary 
study it is therefore neglected in the United States. Onthe contrary, the American 
secondary teacher nowadays is expected to be conversant, superficially at least, with 
problems of education, and a fair number of teachers have really devoted themselves 
to the study with interest and zeal. 
There are three ways in which a teacher may obtain some instruction in pedagogy: 
(1) Many high-school teachers, especially women teachers in charge of the lower 
forms, have received their general education in city or State normal schools, and 
along with this have spent some time upon the theory and practice of education. 
These normal schools haye usually a practicing school attached to them, and in the 
best of them attention is being paid to the development of educational science 
beyond what is found in our training colleges in England. They, however, suffer 
from the same hindrance that besets our English primary training colleges—the fact 
that so many of their students, previously to entering upon the normal course, have 
received an inadequate general education. Hence, only a small part of the instruc- 
tion can be devoted to the training in the strict sense of the term, i. e., to theoretical 
and practical pedagogy. All the normal lecturers whom I met made the same com- 
plaint—that it was impossible to give adequate treatment to pedagogy, because the 
students needed so much help in branches of literature and science which they ought 
to have completed in a high school. 
  
1 Outside the States we find in the Province of Ontario regulations which go beyond anything found 
elsewhere in America. Here there has been established during the last two years a Government 
department called’ the school of pedagogy, which must be attended for twelve months by every 
teacher, whetber a graduate or not, who desires an appointment in an Ontario secondary school. 
(Departmental Regulations, Circular No. 9, 1894, Education Department, Toronto.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-709
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 651 
There are just a few normal colleges of high reputation which give great attention 
to pedagogy. These institutions, like the Lehrertseminar in Germany, usually 
divide their work into two periods, completing the literary and scientific studies in 
the first years and devoting the attention of their students entirely to pedagogy in 
the last year or two. This enables them to get a better grasp of educational prob- 
lems than is possible under the present Government scheme in Great Britain. In 
later years many of these teachers will have saved enough money to go to a univer- 
sity, where they will continue their academic studies and perhaps receive further 
professional training in a university department of pedagogy (see next paragraph). 
Quite a number of high-school teachers, or university men who commenced teaching 
in a humble way in elementary schools, have only reached the university after the 
university age. It is much more common in America than in Europe to find under- 
graduates over 25 years of age. 
On the plan of these normal colleges it was proposed recently in Massachusetts! 
to establish a higher normal college especially adapied to the needs of graduates of 
universities intending to teach in high schools; but the scheme fell through, for it 
is recognized that itis better to associate all higher studies with the universities 
than to separate them into isolated institutions. 
(2) The study of pedagogy in American universities has received a great impetus 
during the last ten years, and the majority of men who intend to teach in high 
schools or to become superintendents are attending pedagogic courses in one or other 
of the 22 universities which have a professor of pedagogy in the faculty. The latest 
figures give at least 4,000 students as taking courses in pedagogy. It should be 
noted that only a small proportion of these 4,000 students are likely to become assist- 
ant masters in secondary schools for any length of time. Many will be made inspect- 
ors and superintendents, many others lecturers in normal schools, The so-called 
higher or secondary training will be needed quite as much for Government inspect- 
ors, for principals of primary schools, and for lecturers in training colleges as for the 
rank and file of schoolmasters. 
Thus the general principle that the study of education is (desivatiie for a university 
man who intends to teach is now everywhere admitted. There are still, no doubt, 
professors in the older universities who have no faith in this novel study, but the 
university opinion has gone against them. 
The chair of pedagogy at Harvard was established some four years ago, and at 
first, as I have been told, the faculty by no means heartily welcomed the new pro- 
fessor; but this feeling has passed away, and it is seen that the chair can be made of 
considerable value to the general aims of university work, particularly in matters 
in which the university comes into relation with the secondary schools.? 
While, however, the science of education has won recognition as a university 
study, we find as yet no general agreement as to the best methods by which the study 
isto be pursued. In the early days, lectures were given on education by a professor 
in some other branch of study, usually philosophy or theology, but two influences 
have operated to give a wholly different character to the study in recent years. The 
excellent pedagogical work produced by the best normal sehools, and in recent 
years the influence of German pedagogics, and particularly the study of the Froe- 
belian and Herbartian systems. 
The main difficulty in the pursuit of pedagogy is created by the need for model or 
practicing schools. In some universities this need is not so much felt, because so 
many of the students, as I have observed above, have been teachers in earlier years; 
and in one or two universities the professor’s classes are composed of men actually 
engaged in the high schools of the neighborhood. Thus, in the University of Penn- 
sylvania, at Philadelphia, I found the large classes attending Professor Brombaugh’s 
lectures composed entirely of superintendents, of high-school principals and assist- 
ants from the city or the neighborhood. 
1§ee Atkinson's Professional Preparation, ete. (Appendix F.)

  652 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Hence, lecture courses on the theory, the history, and the organization of educa- 
tion comprise the bulk of the work done under the name of pedagogy, and students 
attending these courses are allowed to count them as one of the subjects for a uni- 
versity degree. It is felt, however, that something more needs to be done, and 
although as yet no practicing schools have been established similar to the Ubung’s 
Schule in the University of Jena,! beginnings are made in that direction. At the 
Leland Stanford Junior University the professor has a model kindergarten under his 
charge; at Harvard the students are taken to visit schools at Cambridge and Bos- 
ton, and in the State University of Illinois arrangements were made last year for 
the equipment of a proper university practicing school. Still more important is the 
work in research done in the Clark University, in the school of pedagogy, which is 
a department of the University of the City of New York, and in the Teachers’ Col- 
lege attached to Columbia University. This last possesses a well-endowed practic- 
ing school, called the Horace Mann School, with kindergarten, primary, and high- 
school classes. Tt can not be said, however, that there is as yet any concensus of 
opinion as to the best mode by which students of education should receive their 
training in the universities. 
In Germany the problem of higher training has been discussed and experimentally 
treated for the last seventy years, and for the present it has been settled in Prussia 
by the establishment of the Gymnasial Seminar.? In the United States there has 
been no attempt to accomplish higher training in connection with high schools or 
academies. Some such method was tried a few years ago in Toronto, Ontario, but 
has been abandoned in favor of the school of pedagogy now in operation; this last, 
however, is still in the experimental stage. I can not but think that higher train- 
ing must be left to evolve itself by experience in a variety of plans, and that the 
terms of teachers’ registration should be regarded as a matter for the control of pro- 
vincial councils of education. 
(3) Perhaps the most important part of the high-school teacher’s training is that 
acquired after he has commenced active work, by means of teachers’ meetings and 
teachers’ institutes. The teachers’ institute has been for long a recognized and 
peculiar feature of the American school system. In form the gathering is a volun- 
tary assembly of the teachers of a district; but since the State provides funds to 
pay the expenses of the gathering, and since the county superintendent makes the 
arrangements and presides over the gathering, it must be regarded as a part of the 
public plan of education. I have not been able to attend any of these meetings, but 
Ihave heard and read a good deal about them. I should suppose that one half of 
the work may be described as professional and pedagogic, and the other half as popu- 
lar and literary in character. These gatherings are attended by teachers of all 
grades, and, while some of the discussions are on topics common to all, for other 
subjects the institute breaks up into sections, one section for high-school matters, 
another for primary school matters. The institutes last usually for one or two days; 
sometimes a whole week will be taken for the purpose out of a vacation. 
Of a similar character to these teachers’ institutes are the gatherings of superin- 
tendents and lay members of school committees, which are held in Massachusetts, 
and probably in other States also. There must, indeed, be some enthusiasm for the 
work of education, when lay members of school boards can be found willing to join 
with teachers and inspectors in the formal discussion of the duties of their office.?

REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 653 
Apart from the teachers’ institutes which are organized by public authority, are 
the numerous summer schools, which have no connection with the State or the 
county. Originally the summer schools were gatherings, like the Chautauqua 
Assembly, for general study and literature and science; but as the interest in peda- 
gogy has increased, it has found a place in the time-table of nearly all the impor- 
tant summer schools. It is in these schools that the high-school graduates who have 
had no previous training gain most of their acquaintance with pedagogy, an 
acquaintance, no doubt, superficial, but in this, as in other branches of study, the 
student is shown the first steps in a course which he may afterwards follow out in 
private reading and inquiry. If I may venture, after so short a visit, to report a 
general impression, I should say that pedagogy is likely to suffer from the same evil 
that besets all higher studies in America, the lack of a thorough, steady devotion by 
students for a long period of time. The nervous unrest which seems to characterize 
American life as a whole tells with fatal effect upon studies which, in their nature, 
require prolonged application and investigation in order to produce effective results, 
Section V.—Instruction in religion and in citizenship. 
26. Since an inquiry into the nature of the secondary-school curriculum is excluded 
from this report, I have paid no attention to such matters beyond what has been 
required in order to discuss the different types of high schools. It is necessary, 
however, to refer briefly to two branches in the curriculum, to instruction in religion 
and in citizenship, because of their relation to the forces that control the course of 
public education. 
The theory of education recognizes three sources of authority over the child, which 
have claimed and do still claim to control its education: the family, the church, and 
the state; and in the curriculum the influence of the church is recognized in the 
demand for religious instruction, that of the state for instruction in citizenship. 
Now, if we look back to the beginnings of American education, we see how in the 
early days the child’s education was associated with the authority and guidance of 
the church, but as in course of time the church changed in character from a single 
authority, supported by the state and compelling obedience, to a variety of volun- 
tary associations, the school became separated from the church, and the state exer- 
cised its influence without the ecclesiastical association. We find this chango 
represented in the curriculum by the substitution of religious instruction by instruc- 
tion in citizenship. In Germany, where the state and the church are still associated 
in their authority over the school, both religious instruction and citizenship take a 
prominent place. 
The question that first arises in contemplating this situation will be: “ Are the 
American schools to be described as godless or irreligious because definite religious 
instruction has been for so longabandoned?” I venture to think that such an epithet 
would be unjustified. In the old days the schools were not unpatriotic because they 
lacked instruction in citizenship, and to-day the American school is not, as a rule, 
irreligious, although lessons in religion are excluded. 
The error arises from the mistaken supposition that the school either can or should 
provide for all the spiritual and mental needs of the child, and that the child’s life 
will suffer unless every human interest is distinctly incorporated in a course of 
study. On this supposition lessons on teetotalism and alcohol have been introduced 
into the American curriculum, from the desire to train up a community in abhor- 
rence of strong drink.' The end is laudable, and the prohibition party in politics 
is satisfied with this addition to the course of study ; those, however, who attempt 
to promote temperance by such means disregard the nature of the child’s mind and 
means by which the character of the young is trained. The aims of temperance can 
indeed be promoted by teachers who are themselves temperate, and who have studied. 
the conditions under which the growing child learns to control appetite and passion. 
  1See, e. g., Report of Education Department in Ontario, pp. xvi, xvii.
-P-A-G-E-712
  654 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Such teachers will train up the young to avoid excess in drink, although the topic 
may never be mentioned within the school walls. If, as is the case at present in 
parts of America, a vehement popular movement leads the people to insist upon pos- 
itivo instruction in such a subject, the result may be beneficial if the teachers them- 
selves are in earnest about the matter; but such instruction is by no means essential 
to the aim which the people have in view, and in the hands of inefficient or insincere 
teachers not only waste of time but positive moral harm will result. 
Now, without for a moment suggesting that the problem of religious instruction 
stands on a level with the problem of training in temperance, it would appear that 
the same pedagogic principles are involved. If we compare the American secondary 
school with the German secondary school, we find that in the latter formal biblical 
instruction is given the greatest prominence, while in the former it is absent, and 
yet no ono will urge that the American people, either in youth or age, are less reli- 
gious or devout than the Germans. 
The Americans haye chosen to consider that religious instruction can be under- 
taken apart from the school, but by so doing they have not made either teacher or 
school godless and irreligious.! It is true that the American child fails to learn as 
much as it should of the Bible story, and this is a matter to be regretted, not only 
on religious grounds, but for the sake of general culture. The Sunday school is 
never able to supply the place of steady school instruction in biblical knowledge. 
This American teachers themselves regret, but they would protest still more if the 
introduction of religious instruction into the schools was to lead to a revival of the 
bitter sectarian strifes which are found in England and elsewhere. The American 
teacher further points out that, while this regular instruction in biblical knowledge 
is wanting, his schools do much to help the child toward religion; for the teachers 
themselves are, as a rule, serious, religious persons. They conduct the opening 
exercises of the school with reverence, and the children learn in this daily assembly 
the habits of reverence and prayer. If these habits are, as they should be, fostered 
also in the home and in the church by parents and by pastor, the child is as safe 
as he is likely to be in a school which is founded to serve the ends of a religious 
denomination. 
There are, in fact, four different educational aims included under the general 
phrase ‘‘religious instruction,” and any fruitful discussion of the subject should 
keep them apart. Such instruction may (1) train the child in habits of reverential 
worship; (2) impart positive knowledge in the facts of the Bible story; (3) impart 
dogmatic instruction in the creed of church to which the child belongs; (4) direct 
the child’s intelligence to an appreciation of the fundamental ideas of Christian 
morality as exemplified in the character of the great heroes of Bible story and of the 
national religious history. 
All this can be done by the school so as to satisfy the demends of the most exact- 
ing churchman, and yet the root of the matter may not be attained, and no school? 
can pretend to reach the personal ee life of the child—if, indeed, it has a right 
to venture there. 
Now the American school excludes (2) and (3), but it need not exclude (1). The 
“opening exercises” may be of such a character as to train the corporate society of 
the school, assembled morning by morning, in the habit of reverence and prayer. 
If tho family and the church do their share, this will count for much in the 
child’s life. 
In excluding positive Bible knowledge (2), the American school undoubtedly 
suffers, and its teachers admit this. Regarded merely as a part of general culture, 
the children lose by being left in ignorance of the contents of the Bible. In exclud-

?Tho case of tho boarding school is somewhat different. The teacher in a boarding school under- 
tekes entire responsibility in loco parentis for the child's life. But no national system of education 
can undertake so great a responsibility,
-P-A-G-E-713
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 655 
ing dogmatic instruction (3), the American school is doing precisely what is done in 
the great majority of secondary schools in England. 
Fortunately, no school law can either compel or hinder a faithful teacher from 
imbuing his whole school life and influence with Christian ethics that shall make 
for righteousness, if he himself is indeed a teacher realizing, to use Arnold’s phrase, 
that “moral thoughtfulness” is the one final aim of the school. So faras the Ameri- 
can school system, by excluding religion, has tended to diminish the moral respon- 
sibility of the teacher, it has been at fault. It is not for an outsider to judge hastily 
whether this has been the result or not, but there is no reason in the nature of things 
why this should be the case. 
The above has been the general tone which I have found prevalent among both 
teachers and Christian ministers whom I have met in the United States, and on con- 
sulting Bishop Fraser’s report I find that he gained a similar impression in the close 
observation that he made of American schools twenty years ago: 
“T confess to the conviction growing more and more in my own mind, strengthened 
by what I have heard and seen in America, that what we need more of in England 
is intelligent education, a real quickening of the minds of the people, and I say this 
quite as much in the interests of religion as in the prospect of political changes. 
The results of this inquiry would make me much less hostile to a proposition for 
merely secular education if such were inevitable (which I am far from thinking it 
is) than I should have been ten years ago, when it would have simply shocked me. 
Ishould not shrink from still taking what I conceive to be my proper place as a 
clergyman in relation to the school, even under a system of secular education. I 
should neither despair of Christianity nor morality.” (Fraser’s Report, pp. 323-4.) 
27. But since the publication of this report we have had in England! an experi- 
ence which is more valuable than anything which the United States has to offer us, 
the successful endeavor to provide an “unsectarian religious instruction.” This 
phrase has been used mainly in connection with our English primary schools, but it 
might also be fairly used to describe the weekly lesson in biblical knowledge, com- 
bined with the hymn and prayer at the opening of the school day, which are an 
essential part of school life in the majority of English secondary schools. Again 
and again, in talking on this subject with American teachers, they have expressed 
tome their admiration of this plan, and of their regret that the conditions of the 
American school system forbid them to adopt a similar plan in the United States. 
“England seems to be wedded to religious instruction, requires it in her public 
elementary schools by the wishes of the great’ majority of her people, and perhaps 
an equal majority desires or is willing that this should be on a Christian basis. 
“lm Pennsylvania, in seven-eighths of the public schools, the Bible is read by the 
teacher without comment, and this usually constitutes the sum of the religious 
instruction given. In many States this is omitted, and the tendencies are more and 
more to bring our schools to the condition of the French, where every form of 
religious instruction is jealously excluded. The logic of our position, which implies 
the absolute separation of church and state, is rapidly driving us to this place. We 
must apply the same principles to Catholics, Jews, and unbelievers we do to Protes- 
tant sects if in any locality they demand it. We can not, consistently with our 
general theory, levy taxes to force teaching down children’s throats against which 
their consciences protest, and while I believe it is a good thing to give even the 
weak ideas of religion usually gained by an unexplained reading of the New Testa- 
ment, and would hold on to it as long as I could, I should give it up in the face of 
any serious and respectable protest if we are to maintain our present theory of 
public schools. 
“And yet this is to my mind not a satisfactory result to come to. The American 
nation needs more rather than less religious instruction. The formal reading of the 
  
1The Protestant school system of Canada has also successfully employed unsectarian religious 
instruction for many years.

  656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Bible is often a lifeless form. The children do not know the subject read about. 
One word of explanation is often worth the whole chapter read. The home, the 
church, and the Sunday school combinéd do not give nearly sufficient to many chil- 
dren, none at all to many others, and if we are to rule it out of the schools absolutely 
we will also rule it largely out of the life of the nation. Also, while natural ethics 
may be taught and be effective, it is not so pointedly taught as when reinforced by 
the religious sanction. Hence I do not believe that the absolute secularization of 
the schools can be permanently satisfactory except in so far as the nation lowers its 
standards, and I would be glad to find some compromise, if you will call it so, by 
which the great majority of the people of any school district could have definite, 
positive teaching of such a general sort as they might approve, not sectarian, with 
such an arrangement of hours as not to force the attendance of the minority of con- 
scientious opposers. Even unbelievers are often glad, or at least willing, to have 
definite religious and moral ideas taught their children, and it hardly seems to me 
worth while for the great mass of the people, especially those of Anglo-Saxon 
descent, inheriting the religious tendencies of the race, to witness their own growth 
in religious indifference for the sake of a theory, if an equally satisfactory result 
for the rest of the nation can be secured by another arrangement. 
“Tf in a district of 100 families, 95 desire and would be greatly profited by the 
infusion of general religious truth, and can not get it except through the schools, 
why not excuse the 5 from attendance and give it.” (President Sharpless in The 
Relation, etc. as 
At present, in America, the fundamental laws of the States forbid the introduc- 
tion of even “‘unsectarian religious instruction” into the public schools; they do 
not forbid it in England, and I am convinced that the immense majority of parents 
who send children to English secondary schools will be prepared to trust our second- 
ary teachers with this important part of their duty, as they would in America if the 
way were open. 
The whole question depends upon this issue, whether the people themselves accept 
and desire an unsectarian religious instruction, or whether they are so devoted to 
church forms as to be alienated from an education in which their own church is not 
represented. Now, this attitude has only been taken up in America by the people of 
one ‘great church. The Roman Catholic tradition in education dates back to a time 
- when the church and the schools were one, and the Roman Catholic Church will 
never recede from such a position.! Hence it is admitted that in the United States 
a certain amount of injustice is done to that section of the Roman Catholic popula- 
tion whose conscience keeps them from sending their children to the public schools ;? 
but the total number of such parents is relatively very small, and any attempt to 
remedy the injustice would raise such strife that no serious attempt is likely to be 
made to heal the trouble.* 
And this ‘injustice” is after all not so monstrous as it is sometimes represented. 
1 And it must be observed that the Roman Catholics only plead for “separate schools” for young 
children. They have no objection to sending their boys and girls to be taught with heretics in the 
high schools. They definitely declare that they do not desire to keep their children away from the 
high schools; so long as they can influence the young mind up to 12 years of ago they are satisfied. 
2Tt is only a certain section, even of the Roman Catholic population, who feel this injustice, and 
who desire to keep their children separate from the rest of the population. In Ontario, at the last 
census, out of 90,000 Roman Catholic children, only 30,000 were in separate schools, although the 
Dominion law gives them the right, which is desired by some in England, of claiming both local rates 
and State aid for separate schools. I have no figures—probably none are to be had—for the United 
States, but I am told that the more liberal minded among the Roman Catholics support the public 
school system. 
3 Besides the Roman Catholics there are, in one or two districts of the West, colonies of Lutheran 
Germans alien to the American Commonwealth alike in language and religion. Here also the injus- 
tice is felt, but the injustice would be still greater to the State, as a whole, if these colonies were 
allowed to establish themselves as an alien population, apart from the rest of their State in blood and 
in speech.
-P-A-G-E-715
  REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 657 
The principle on which the State acts in supplying education at public cost is pre- 
cisely the same as that on which it supplies free libraries or parks—it is a provision 
for the general good of the community, which any individual may use or decline to 
use as he pleases; he is taxed in support of this provision not, in the first instance, 
because he is a parent, but because he is a citizen. He may, from various motives 
(religious or other), prefer to patronize private schools or private libraries—and he 
can not on that account complain of having to pay twice over for these matters; 
when once the community has determined that its welfare depends upon adopting 
public provision for education and culture, it is idle for malcontents to complain of 
injustice; their only resource is to attack the socialistic basis on which the com- 
munity is acting. Now, in America, this attack can not possibly succeed, because 
the belief in public education as a part of civic duty is so firmly implanted; the 
Roman Catholics in certain parts of America have, therefore, hoped, like a certain 
section of “‘the Church” party in England, to secure a share of the public taxes. 
But their hope is vain; for the public taxes are raised for public purposes, not for 
the encouragement of private enterprises, even though these enterprises have high 
religious aims. 
The injustice, however, is felt and can not be denied in the case of Roman Cath- 
olic parents who are poor and who can not establish private schools suited to their 
religious opinions; the remedy, such as it is, can only be found in the zeal of the 
Roman Catholic community, whose wealthier members enable the clergy and the 
sisterhoods to maintain parochial schools. The upholders of the public schools 
usually admit and regret this injustice to the poorer section of the Roman Catholics, 
but they see no means of remedy which would not be worse than the disease; for 
they can not permit public money raised solely for the purposes of education to be 
expended by clergy who are devoted, not to education, but to religious propagandism. 
In Canada, by the original Statutes of the Confederation, the Catholics have 
obtained the right to establish State-aided separate schools, and, in consequence, the 
politics of Canada have never been free from bitter sectarian strife. 
Since the example of Canada is being quoted just now in England, it should be 
understood that the separate-school system is permitted only in consequence of 
terms laid down to appease the Roman Catholics, when the Dominion was first 
created. The Episcopalians in Canada very seldom approve of the plan. (See 
Appendix D.) 
It may, perhaps, be right in special cases, such as parts of Canada and the United 
States present, to permit a Roman Catholic population to establish an independent 
system of schools; but it would be most unfortunate and illogical to adduce the 
example of America as a guide to us in England, where the conditions are wholly 
different. 
Hence, I conclude, in view of the possibility of secondary schools being estab- 
lished in England under public control, that the experience of America would urge 
us to give no support to institutions which are founded in the first instance to serve a 
denominational purpose. And it would also point to the wisdom of permitting the 
parents in each locality to decide whether they will prefer their children to receive 
unsectarian religious instruction, and, what is of more importance, the silent train- 
ing in habits of reverence and worship obtained by the assembly of the school for 
simple worship at the beginning of the school day. If, however, such an arrange- 
ment leads to strife, it would be wiser to end the controversy by excluding religious 
instruction entirely from the school, leaving it, as in America, to the family and the 
church. 
28. The responsibility of the school with regard to training in citizenship is now 
for the first time being discussed in England, and I refer to it here because it seems 
clear that the assumption by the State to complete authority over the school leads 
directly to the demand by the State that the teacher shall train his children in 
patriotism. 
In the hands of a wise teacher, who sincerely cares for the welfare of his country,  
-P-A-G-E-716
  658. EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
such instruction may be invaluable, and I believe that in Germany it has proved a 
distinct aid in tho development of true citizenship. But here again it is important 
to distinguish aims and methods. The school can attempt— 
(1) To give positive knowledge in national history, which shall serve as a basis ” 
for interest in the national welfare in later years. 
(2) To give formal lessons in civies, i. e., in the facts relating to local and imperial 
government. 
(3) To assist children to realize their relation to their country by seizing hold of 
the opportunity presented by great national events and days, celebrating them 
appropriately and explaining their significance. 
(4) By so organizing the corporate life of a school society (mainly outside of the 
class room) as to develop in a child the habits and ideas of esprit de corps, of public 
spirit and devotion to the common interests of the society; thus the children are 
prepared in the microcosm of the school to play a greater part hereafter in the civic 
community. 
Now, of these four methods, the last has been employed most successfully in 
English “public schools” (I use the term in our English sense). Perhaps the most 
distinctive contribution to pedagogy which England can offer is the methods of dis- 
cipline and training exhibited in good English boarding schools. The second is 
almost unknown in England or Germany, but forms a distinct part of the curriculum 
in French and in many American schools. I very much question its value for the 
purposo in view, for it is a question whether the bedy of facts relating to local gov- 
ernment are suitable for children to understand; at any rate, they would need very 
careful handling in order to prove of real educational value. We have here the same 
danger‘of error that is seen in those who advocate formal instruction in temperance 
and hygiene, or in dogmatic Christianity; the intention is worthy, but the means 
are not likely to achieve the end in view; the lessons on these subjects will not be 
long remembered unless they ure really suitable to the child’s understanding and 
adapted to his present mental needs and interests. 
The third method is employed in Germany with excellent success, as I have often 
witnessed, by teachers who are themselves patriotic, and understand how to touch 
the imagination and the hearts of children. I am told that in America such celebra- 
tions are also valued in the schools; but if a tree is known by its fruit, one can not 
take a high estimate of the civic instruction imparted by American teachers. The 
same rule must apply here as in every branch of instruction—the teaching depends 
upon the teacher—he who teaches patriotism out of a book, according to the order 
of a school board, without himself feeling the right motive and interest, will do 
harm to his children. * * * 
I believe that all four methods, if employed with judgment and by teachers of 
experience, will help children to realize their duty and their privileges toward their 
mother country. Itis evidently the State’s concern to labor for the production of 
such a result; and it will be achieved, not by the publication of text-books—though 
these may help the cause—but by training an army of teachers who will understand 
their responsibility in this and. in all matters which concerm the character and the 
conduct of English children while under instruction.

12, AFF@aviT of PRESIDING OFFICER. 
By thelaws of 1892, ch. 378, sec. 25, the annual report of every institution must be ‘verified by the 
oath of its presiding officer,” which term may mean either the president of the institution or the 
chairman of its trustees. It is very desirable that the report bo read and approved by the trustees, 
but if this can not be done in time to send the report to the regents before September 1, it should be 
sent as soon as authenticated by the presiding officer, and read to the trustees aiterwards.

RELIGION AND THE STATE SOHOOL SYSTEM IN UPPER CANADA. 
{From The Educational System of the Province of Ontario, prepared for the Columbian Exhibition 
by John Millar, B. A., deputy minister of education, printed for the education department, 
Toronto, 1892-93.] 
ITS RELATIONS TO CHURCHES. 
There is no established church in Ontario or connection between church and state. 
The constitution gives the Province control of its educational affairs, and the great 
majority of the people believe that schools and colleges should be nondenomina- 
tional. No religious body has any voice in the management of the high and public 
schools or the university. These institutions are, however, far from being ‘‘god- 
less” or irreligious. Though not religious, they are institutions of a Christian 
people. The doctrines of no church are taught, but the principles of Christianity 
form an essential feature of the daily exercises. The teachers are, with very rare 
exceptions, men and women of high moral character. The cooperation of the clergy 
of all denominations in educational gatherings is quite common, and recognition of 
religion is fully shown in the following regulations which have been prescribed by 
the education department: 
(1) Every public and high school shall be opened with the Lord’s Prayer and 
closed with the reading of the Scriptures and the Lord’s Prayer, or the prayer 
authorized by the department of education. 
(2) The Scriptures shall be read daily and systematically without comment or 
explanation, and the portions used may be taken from the book of selections 
adopted by the department for that purpose, or from the Bible, as the trustees, by 
resolution, may direct. 
(3) Trustees may also order the reading of the Bible or the authorized Scripture 
selections by both pupils and teachers at the opening and closing of the school, and 
the repeating of the ten commandments at least once a week. 
(4) No pupil shall be required to take part in any religious exercise objected to by 
his parents or guardians, and in order to the observance of this regulation, the 
teacher, before commencing a religious exercise, is to allow a short interval to elapse 
during which the children of Roman Catholics and of others who have signified their 
objection may retire. 
(5) If, in virtue of the right to be absent from the religious exercises, any pupil 
does not enter the schoolroom till fifteen minutes after the proper time for opening
-P-A-G-E-728
  670 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the school in the forenoon, such absence shall not be treated as an offense against 
the rules of the school. 
(6) When a teacher claims to haye conscientious scruples in regard to opening or 
closing the school as herein prescribed, ho shall notify the trustees to that effect in 
writing; and it shall be the duty of the trustees to make such provision in the 
premises as they may deem expedient. 
(7) The clergy of any denomination, or their authorized representatives, shall 
have the right to give religious instruction to the pupils of their own church in each 
schoolhouse, at least once a week, after the hour of closing the school in the after- 
noon; and if the clergy of more than one denomination apply to give religious 
instruction in the same schoolhouse, the board of trustees shall decide on what day 
of the week the schoolhouse shall be at the disposal of the clergymen of each 
denomination at the time above stated. But itshall be lawful for the board of trus- 
tees and clergyman of any denomination to agree upon any hour of the day at which 
a clergyman, or his authorized representative, may give religious instruction to the 
pupils of his own church, provided it be not during the regular hours of school. 
Emblems of a denominational character shall not be exhibited in a public school 
during regular school hours. 
The Imperial statute, called the British North America act, which united the 
provinces forming the Dominion of Canada, guaranteed certain educational priv- 
ileges to the Roman Catholic citizens of Ontario. The separate schools act, as it is 
termed, enables Protestants, as well as Roman Catholics, to establish, under certain 
conditions, schools for themselves. In these schools, in addition to the ordinary 
course of study for public schools, religious exercises are taken up under direction of 
the trustees. The education department has not the same authority under the statute 
over Roman Catholic separate schools as it has over the public schools; yet in the 
main features, such as the qualification of teachers, excepting those in religious 
orders, the selection of text-books, except those required for religious exercises, the 
authority of the department may be said to be the same, There is no provision in 
the constitution allowing the establishment of separate high schools, and any private 
or denominational institutions of this kind which have been established receive no 
legislative aid, nor are their supporters exempted from taxation for the national 
schools. The Roman Catholics have shown as little disposition as the Protestants 
to establish denominational schools for secondary education, and the verdict of all 
classes appears to be that religious convictions are not interfered with, and that 
Christian principles are strengthened by attendance at the high schools and colle- 
giato institutes. A few church schools have been opened for boys and séveral ladies’ 
colleges have been established by different denominations. The course of study in 
these institutions is, in many respects, similar to that in the high schools, and the 
students frequently write at the same university and departmental examinations.

  6 Or ANSWERS SENT BY TEACHERS IN ONTARIO TO A CIRCULAR OF THE 
Roya (BRITISH) COMMISSION ON SECONDARY EpvcaTION. 
Question 6 of circular: How far is secondary education given free of charge in your 
colony, and how has the system worked? 
[From Mr. John Seath, high-school inspector for Ontario.] 
(1) In this Province, as elsewhere, there are a number of scholars ‘whose cireum_ 
stances would lead them to earn their living by manual labor, and particularly by 
agricultural labor, but who are unwilling or unfitted to do so.” Owing, however, 
to the continued opening up of unsettled parts of the Dominion, and especially to 
the proximity of the United States, we have so far experienced no serious difficulty 
from this source, Large numbers of Canadian clerks and lawyers and doctors read- 
ily find remunerative employment in the Northern and Western States of the Union, 
thus relieving to a large extent the overproduction of those who are unwilling or 
unfitted to earn their living by manual labor. In this Province, I may add, there is 
no lack of mechanics or of farm hands (except, occasionally, of the latter during 
the harvest). Many of these also emigrate—farmers to the northwestern territories, 
and now and then to the United States, and mechanics to the United States chiefly. 
Ontario is now pretty thickly populated, and in this respect its condition resembles. 
that of the mother country. We are suffering from the overcrowding of the legal 
and medical professions and the “genteeler” employments, but owing to the excep- 
tional position of the Province we do not suffer nearly so much as is understood to 
be the case in the older countries of Europe. 
(2) It would be wrong, I think, to attribute the existence of a class that are disin- 
clined to or unfit for manual labor primarily to overeducation or to education out of 
their sphere. To do so would be to mistake for the real cause one of the immediate 
effects. The condition of matters under consideration is due, I believe, to one of 
tho strongest sentiments of modern civilization. There are few nowadays who do 
not desire to improye their own social status or to enable their children to do so, 
and the higher the civilization the greater the desire. Theoretically, manual labor 
is esteemed; practically, it is a bar to social advancement. This feeling exists here, 
though not nearly to the same extent as in the mother country. Besides, many mer 
are by nature disinclined to physical exertion; they prefer mental to physical toil. 
This is especially true of those who do not realize the fact that mental toil is more 
Jaborious and exhausting than physical. The higher education is consequently 
eagerly sought after as a means of gratifying these feclings. Civilization also engen- 
ders or at least stimulates the desire to live in centers of population, wherc life 
is pleasanter and the facilities for enjoyment are greater than in the country, If 
secondary schools exist in these centers it is clear that they will be utilized at 
all hazards, and that so long as human nature is constituted as it is we can no& 
materially reduce the objectionable pressure by barring the doors of the secondary 
schools to all except the wealthy. It is, as I have said, wrong to attribute this over- 
pressure to oyereducation; the prime motive has its roots in human nature. During 
the last ten years the attendance at the secondary schools in this Province has been 
almost doubled, and consequently the output from the secondary schools has been 
largely increased. This has been due to the general advancement of the Province, 
the improvement of our public schools, and to the number, efficiency, and cheapness 
of our secondary schools. The urban population of this country has also increased 
more rapidly than tho rural population, owing to the protective financial system of 
the Dominion, which has fostered the establishment of factories, situated, of course, 
in centers of population where there are railways and other facilities. In these, 
also, are situated the high schools and collegiate institutes, so that this cause has 
also increased the number of those averse to manual labor.

(3) As to the remedies. If I am right that this objectionable condition of affairs 
is due to tho constitution of human nature, it is to human nature that we should 
look for the remedy. In the struggle for existence if a man fails to secure a liveli- 
hood in one way he will try to secure it in another, even if he has to work with his 
hands. Hewill take care, also, that his children do not make their father’s mistake. 
Experience will teach the lesson that a good education makes the farmer and the 
mechanic better workmen, besides adding to their means of enjoyment, Experience 
will also teach that. manual labor is quite as honorable and at least as healthy as 
mental labor. So far as I can see, the only school in which man can learn these les- 
sons is that of experience. Learned there, they will be effective. A good deal may, 
however, be done by those in authority to set matters right. 
(a) Access to the professions should be barred to all except those of good attain- 
ments and mental ability. In this Province or elsewhere it has been too easy to 
become a lawyer or a doctor or a teacher, and in particular the university matricula- 
tion examination has been too casy. These defects we are gradually removing in 
this Provinee. The new curricula will exact a higher standard. 
(b) Much may be done to better the condition of the farmer in particular and 
inerease the dignity of his lot. In this Province various effective means have been 
taken to secure this result. One of the ministers of tle local cabinet has charge of 
agriculture, and is himself a farmer. The agricultural college has also done much 
to raise the status of the farmers. Agriculture is thus always “in evidence” with 
us. <A third political party, consisting of farmers, has recently arisen here, which, 
it is said, will hold the balance of power in the Ontario legislature. 
[From Mr. J.B. Bryant, M.. A.J 
Does it unduly draw children away from the farm and lead to their crowding into 
cities? 
It certainly dees conduce to the drawing away of children from the farm and the 
crowding of them into the cities, but whether ‘ unduly” or not is. a matter, perhaps, 
for difference of opinion. There is no inherent virtue in country life that it should 
be specially concerned, no inherent viciousness in city life that it should be specially 
deprecated. The faultof our secondary education system lies not in the fact that 
it is inimical to country life, but that it is inimical to industrial pursuits of every 
sort. In this it shares responsibility with almost every other national system. 
Youth is the period not only of learning but of adaptation. The ideals of life are 
fixed. before the age of maturity fully sets in. The result is that a boy educated at 
one of our secondary schools, with no ideal of life before him but that of some 
intellectual pursuit, generally adapts himself to that ideal, and becomes, by sheer 
force of environment, a candidate for some such profession as law, medicine, the- 
ology, or pedagogy. The remedy lies (and the word ‘‘remedy” is a correct one, for 
the phenomenon is one of disease, not of normal social order) in the adaptation of 
our secondary system of instruction not alone to those intellectual pursuits men- 
tioned, but to all other pursuits proper to a well-constituted social order, that is, to 
the-so-called industrial pursuits as well as to the professional ones. 
[From Mr. A. H. Morrison, late English master, Brantford Collegiate Institute.] 
The professions to-day in Canada, including those of law, medicine, and education, 
are filled to overflowing with a mass of the so-called educated, who have renounced 
their legitimate callings on the farm, or at the counter, or in domestic service to 
_ inundate the cities, towns, and villages with a deluge of professional mediocrity or 
‘worse. 
It. is not too: much to: say that many professional men. who have been educated at 
the high schools: of Ontario, and who have taken degrees and diplomas at the uni- 
versity, are to-day in a state bordering upon actual want. They can not dig, or will 
not, having become sensitive by contact with letters, whileto beg they are ashamed;

  REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 675 
and it requires little keenness of observation to trace the cause of much of the social 
unrest, distress, and despair of the present age to the virus of miseducation which 
has infected the blood of the body politic. 
A high education engenders wants, desires, aspirations, ambitions. How are these 
to be gratified? 
Tho thousands that are annually forsaking the country districts and manual labor 
for the city and its avocations, especially that of teaching, will not return to the 
country when their educational term is completed, unless it be to take a position as 
teacher in a rural school, at a salary that would be flouted by a bartender, and this 
merely as a means to obtain a little more money wherewith to prosecute further 
studies in medicine, divinity, or law. 
A little learning is a dangerous thing, and it is but a little learning that the high 
schools, as at present constituted, can give. True, the subjects are many, by far too 
many; there is nothing too lofty nor to erudite for their curricula, from Greek to 
geometry, Latin to literature, algebra to acoustics, dynamics to drill, psychology to 
sectarianism, arithmetic to agriculture, trigonometry to temperance; but itis merely 
veneer, the smattering begotten of systematic cram and ceaseless examinations. 
The young man comes to the high school fresh from the country. He may or may 
not have had somo preliminary training in the higher grade subjects taught in the 
upper schools. He has had to pass a certain examination for entrance—thatis to say, 
he has had to obtain a certain percentage of marks in the following subjects: Read- 
ing, English literature, orthography and orthepy, geography, English composition, 
outlines of Canadian history, arithmetic, writing and drawing, physiology and 
temperance, but of classics or moderns, or science, or anything approaching to cor- 
rect, not to say literary, English he need know little or nothing. These things have 
to be crammed into him at the shortest possible notice by men, or women, so-called 
specialists, who, more particularly in the smaller schools, are heavily handicapped 
in their work, being often compelled to teach half a dozen subjects with one or two 
of which alone they are familar. In a certain provincial high school the head master, 
a specialist in French and German, has had to take, besides his own subject, mathe- 
matics and science, knowing as much about the last, upon his own confession, as the 
majority of the students themselves, In another collegiate school drill and gymnas- 
tics were coupled with English language and literature, albeit the instructor (sic) 
knew no more of club swinging than of Choctaw, and had not been inside of a gym- 
nasium for twenty-five years. 
The outcome may be imagined—superficiality, theory, mere rote work. Of course 
the larger schools are better officered and equipped, but even in these much of the 
work done is of the most perfunctory nature, and three-fourths of it worthless to 
the student in his after life. 
The cause of much of tho haste, superficiality, and mental indigestion is directly 
attributable to the fact that we are all attempting to doin one year or two years 
what should properly take two or four years to accomplish. 
The majority of the sufferers plead poverty as an excuse for haste. They can 
not afford, even with State aid, to protract their time of studies. And now comes 
in one of the most burning of all the vexed questions connected with the popular 
education theory. To what extent has the pleader of poverty a right to higher edu- 
cation at all? Isit not a luxury, to be paid for like other luxuries? Is the State 
bound to provide Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon, and the higher mathematics any moro 
than it is bound to provide carriages and horses, footmen, and heraldic devices? 
Is popular higher education tending in ‘‘this Canada of ours” to happiness and 
contentment? So far as we have been able to judge we unhesitatingly say it is not, 
for with education have arisen aspirations that can not be gratified save at the cost 
of simplicity and honor; the limitations remain the same as before, the desires are 
doubled or trebled. 
As we have already observed, there is a class of students to be found in every high

school of the province to whom certain of the preceding remarks do not apply. They 
are the children of wealthy men, or of intelligent men, who desire a more systematic 
and thorough training for their sons and daughters than that accorded to the mere 
examination hobbyist. These take their studies more deliberately, remain longer in 
the classes, and usually have the advantage of entering the high schools at an early 
age, passing into them from the public schools by competitive examination. Many 
of these students do not enter for the university, or learned professions, or final 
examinations at all. They drop out sometimes to go to private or to special institu- 
tions; sometimes, especially in the case of the girls, to assume home duties; some- 
times to obtain clerkships, or assist their fathers in their respective callings. It is 
to be regretted that many of tho best and brightest students thus pass away and are 
lost, while of those that remain a large percentage are from the country or from the 
humbler classes, whose sole aim is the teacher’s certificate or the coveted pass which 
admits them to the university, and so to the threshold of the overburdened, under- 
paid, and often ill-served professions.

VERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, MASS., IN ANSWER TO A CIRCULAR 8 
(ENGLISH) CoMMISSION ON SECONDARY EpvUcaTION. or HARVARD UNI- 
: OUT BY THE ROYAL 
      
Questions. 
1. What is your experience of the education of boys and girls in the same day 
schools or in the same day classes? 
2. What is your opinion of the working of the system and as to the conditions most 
favorable to it as regards— 
Age of scholars? 
Size of the school? 
3. How best may provision be made for the passing of the scholars from one class of 
school to another, and for giving aid to poor scholars of promise? 
4, What has been found to be the best way of bringing technical into proper rela- 
tion with general education in your secondary schools? 
5. What provision exists for the training of secondary-school teachers? How far is 
such training provided in connection with the universities? 
6. It has been said that the secondary schools of the United States turn out a large 
number of scholars whose circumstances would lead them to earn their living 
by manual labor, and particularly by agricultural labor, but who are unwill- 
ing or unfitted to do so, and have little prospect of finding congenial employ- 
ment. How far, if at all, is that statement true? If true, to what cause or 
causes do you attribute it? And what remedies would you suggest? 
7. What proportion of students enter your universities without having previously 
passed through a secondary school? 
8. Has there been any material change since 1865 in the system of public secondary 
education in your State? If so, what, and on what grounds was it called for? 
Is the result satisfactory? 
9. Has there recently been any considerable increase in the number of private 
schools in your State? Ifso, to what cause do you attribute this increase? 
1and 2. In the free public schools of the United States boys and girls are, as a 
rule, educated together up to the age of 18 or 19, the schools being invariably day 
schools. The exceptions to this rule are insignificant in number. The preparatory 
departments maintained by many colleges and universities admit, as a rule, both 
boys and girls, and these are generally boarding schools. The State and city normal 
schools, as a rule, admit both men and women, but the women are in great majority. 
Many of the so-called colleges which admit young men and women are really only 
secondary schools for persons whose education has been belated. The custom of 
the country, speaking broadly, is to educate boys and girls together “‘in the same
-P-A-G-E-735
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 677 
day schools or in the same day classes.” The method is practicable, economical, and 
free from serious evils or embarrassments. 
In the Eastern part of the United States, among well-to-do people, separate schools 
for boys and for girls are preferred for children over 12 or 13 years old. In this part 
of the country, therefore, private and endowed schools, charging tuition fees, are 
maintained for girls or for boys separately ; and the same practice is well established 
in the largo cities of the Western States. These private and endowed schools are 
sometimes day schools and sometimes boarding schools. An illustration of the 
strength of this preference has lately been given in Boston, where a private day 
school expressly intended to keep boys and girls together up to the age of 18, and 
conducted with great intelligence and generosity, has just been abandoned as hope- 
less after years of patient effort. The creation of several separate colleges for women 
in the Eastern States within the past twenty-five years, in spite of the fact that 
many institutions originally intended for men have been opened to women during 
the same period, illustrates the same tendency of public opinion. 
In my opinion, the education of boys and girls together works well up to 10 or 12 
years of age. After that age there seems to me to be advantage in separating the 
two sexes. The size of the school is not an important consideration, for a large 
school may easily be divided into small classes or sections. The principal consider- 
ations seem to me to be, first, the homogencousness of the community—the more 
homogeneous the community as regards race, religion, and mode of life the better 
mixed schools work—and, secondly, the pecuniary competency of the community to 
provide separate schools for older girls and older boys. Separate schools cost more, 
and in rural communities are almost impracticable. In most American communities 
the opinion prevails that girls should have as good an education as boys. The 
easiest and cheapest way to give effect to this opinion is to teach the girls and boys 
together. 
3. By ‘‘the passing of scholars from one class or school to another” I understand 
the passing of scholars from a primary school to a higher elementary school, and from 
that higher elementary school to a secondary school. In the United States parents 
usually keep their children in the public schools so long as they can afford to dis- 
pense with the children’s labor. Nevertheless not over 5 per cent of the children 
ever reach a secondary school. The determining consideration is the pecuniary con- 
dition of the family, the public schools, secondary as well as elementary, being all 
free. There is no provision in the United States for giving aid to good scholars in 
the elementary schools who desire to resort to the secondary schools, but whose par- 
ents are not able to give them that privilege. It must be remembered that there are 
immense tracts of territory in the United States where there are no secondary schools. 
Cities and large towns ordinarily maintain them, the rural districts seldom. 
4. In a considerable number of American cities shops in which various forms of 
manual training can be given have been added to the public secondary school called 
the high school. In Boston a separate secondary school called the Mechanic Arts 
High School has recently been established at public expense. In Cambridge, near 
Boston, private munificence has provided a manual training school which is in asso- 
ciation with the public high school, so that the pupils do part of their work in the 
high school and part of it in the manual training school. All these recent develop- 
ments must still be described as experimental. It is not yet clear how manual and 
technical subjects are to be dealt with in the secondary schools of the United States. 
The private and endowed schools have made very little effort in this direction. 
They have recently introduced laboratory methods of teaching sciences, but they 
have not introduced anything which can properly be called technical education. 
5. The best secondary school teachers in the United States are graduates of col- 
leges or scientific schools—that is to say, they have ordinarily received the degree of 
bachelor of arts, or bachelor of philosophy, or bachelor of science. Within a few 
years past several American universities have introduced instruction in pedagogy, 
or at least in the history and art of teaching. The norma] schools of the United 
 
-P-A-G-E-736
  678 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
States haye been thus far schools of a grade but little, if at all, above that of the 
public secondary schools called high schools, so that the great majority of their 
graduates are only fit to teach in the elementary schools. This very yoar a move- 
ment has begun to raise the grade of the normal schools of Massachusetts, the inten- 
tion being to require graduation at a high school for admission to a normal school. 
6. The public schools of the United States, being situated, as a rule, in large 
towns and cities, have very little to do with the children of farmers or of agricul- 
tural laborers. They are resorted to, however, by large numbers of the children of 
mechanics and other persons who get their living by some form of manuallabor. It 
seems to me to be true that the graduates of high schools, both young women and 
young men, endeavor in after life to carn their living in the lighter and more agrec- 
able employments, in which brains tell for more and muscles for less. No other 
result could be anticipated. That is just what educated people of all sorts and con- 
ditions expect to do. An education which does not produce this effect has certainly 
missed one of its important objects. I have never observed that the graduates of 
secondary schools in the United States had more difficulty in finding congenial 
employment than other young people. I should suppose, on the contrary, that they 
would have less difficulty. The question does not seem to me to refer to any real 
evil. It is not the object of an education prolonged till 18 or 19 years of age to pro- 
duce a coal heaver, or a scullion, or an agricultural laborer, in the English sense of 
that term. In the higher departments of farm labor in the United States there is, as 
in other countries in which agricultural machinery is much used, quite as much 
opportunity for the exercise of trained intelligence and skill as in a machine shop or 
afactory. In the Western States, therefore, the children of farmers resort in con- 
siderable numbers to the universities and to the preparatory schools connected with 
colleges and universities. 
7. I can only answer this question with reference to Harvard University, for I am 
not familiar with the facts of any other institution. During the past twenty years 
from one-eighth to one-fifth of the young men admitted year by year to Harvard 
College (the department which gives the degree of bachelor of arts) had been pre- 
pared by private teachers and had not passed through a secondary school, or at least 
had not completed the course of a secondary school. All the professional depart- 
ments of Harvard University maintain admission examinations, but the grade of 
these examinations is below the grade of the examination for admission to Harvard 
College, except that the theological school accepts no students as candidates for its 
degree who do not already hold, on entering the school, an academic degree. After 
the academic year 1895-96 this same regulation will obtain in the law school. I 
have no means of ascertaining what proportion of students have heretofore entered 
Harvard University in the professional schools without having previously passed 
through a secondary school. In general, if has been true throughout the United 
States that the schools of law and medicine have been open to any applicant, no mat- 
ter what his previous training might have been, and that the scientific or technolog- 
ical schools have been open on much easier terms than the colleges. The secondary 
schools have, therefore, lacked the support which they should have received from 
the institutions of technical and professional education. The colleges may be said, 
in a rough way, to have given support to secondary education; but owing to the fact 
that secondary schools have not existed in anything like adequate numbers, many 
colleges and universities, particularly in the Western States, have felt forced to 
maintain preparatory departments of their own. In recent years there has been a 
tendency among the stronger institutions to abandon their preparatory departments. 
8. There has been no single material change since 1865 in the system of public 
secondary education in Massachusetts, but there has been a gradual improvement in 
the free secondary schools, and there has been an increase in the number of schools 
called secondary or high. Interesting changes are the increased importance of the 
superintendent’s or supervisor’s function, the free provision of text-books, the free 
transportation of children to central schools from outlying districts, the increased

attention to the English language, the gradual introduction of proper methods of 
teaching the sciences, and the progressive modification of the traditional school cur- 
riculum which admitted Latin, Greek, and mathematics, and little else. All these 
changes have affected elementary as well as secondary schools. 
9. The number of private schools, both elementary and secondary, maintained by 
the Roman Catholics in Massachusetts has decidedly increased; and the relative 
influence of private and endowed schools in Massachusetts has also increased within 
the last twenty years. This is partly the effect of the increased heterogeneousness 
of the population, both as regards race and mode of life. It is partly due also to 
the fact that the private and endowed schools have established a distinct superiority 
to the public schools, because they are freer to experiment with new methods of 
instruction and to adopt methods which prove to be good, and because they spend 
more money per pupil. In Massachusetts it has been the private and endowed schools 
which have adopted most promptly the improvements in education urged upon 
schools by colleges and universities. 
MEMORANDUM ON THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN ENGLAND. 
[By J. G. Fitch, esq., LL. D.] 
(1) The importance of giving definite professional preparation to teachers has long 
been fully recognized in the sphere of elementary education. From the foundation 
of the two great societies—the National Society and the British and Foreign School 
Society in 1811 and in 1808, respectively—persons desiring to become teachers in 
National or British schools were received at the Sanctuary, in Westminster, or at 
the Borough Road to ‘‘learn the system” by 2 few months’ attendance at the model 
schools; the Home and Colonial School Society established its training school in 1836; 
and before any public grants were made for the purpose in England, Dr. J. Phillips 
Kay, afterwards better known as Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, had, by private effort 
and in conjunction with Mr. Carleton Tuffnell, succeeded in establishing a training 
school at Battersea. In 1839, when, under Lord Melbourne’s Government, a commit- 
tee of the privy council was appointed to administer such funds as might be voted 
by Parliament for public education, among the first proposals made by that commit- 
tec, at the suggestion of its secretary, Dr. Kay, was one for the establishment of a 
State normal institution for the training of teachers. This proposal was not adopted 
by the legislature, but encouragement was given to religious and voluntary bodies, 
and by 1846, when the first minutes of council were issued, 9 training institu- 
tions, including Whitelands, Warrington, and St. Mark’s, Chelsea, had been estab- 
lished. Within the ten subsequent years many diocesan colleges, the Wesleyan 
Training Collego at Westminster and the Roman Catholic College at Liverpool, 
were added to the list, and there are now 43 residential training institutions in 
England and Wales. They all owe their origin to local effort, to educational socie- 
ties and religious bodies, but receive large subventions from the education depart- 
ment, amounting to about three-fourths of the annual cost of their maintenance. 
(2) The professional qualifications of a teacher, which it is the business of a train- 
ing college to provide, are held to include: 
(a) A full and thorough knowledge of the subjects to be taught. 
(b) Acquaintance with the best methods and rules of school organization, teach- 
ing, and discipline, and with the principles which underlie those rules. 
(c) So much of the elements of ethics, logic, and psychology as has a bearing on 
the art and philosophy of teaching. 
(d) Some knowledge of the literature of education and of the lives and works of 
famous teachers. . 
(e) Actual practice under supervision in the art of teaching a class and conduct- 
ing aschool. [By the regulations of the department, every student is required to

spend during the two years of training not less than one hundred and fifty hours in! 
the practicing school.] 
(f) Criticism lessons and the preparation of notes and sketches. 
(g) Observation of good models, both of teaching and of school organization and 
equipment. 
(3) All experience has tended strongly to confirm the belief in the great value of 
this discipline. There are, of course, exceptions. On the ono hand, a few persons 
enter the profession so remarkably qualified by personal enthusiasm and special 
aptitude that they achieve success without any technical training; and on the other, 
it is possible for some to pass through the whole of such a course who fail to be 
inspired by it, and who are, after all, content to fall into routine and to remain in 
the lower ranks. But these cases are comparatively rare. All school managers 
know that there is, as a general rule, an enormous difference between the trained 
and the untrained teacher; and that although many of the candidates who pass 
through the normal colleges can not be said to possess a liberal or an extended gen- 
eral education, yet what they know they can teach by right methods and with good 
effect. Indeed, all who are familiar with the kind of teaching to be heard in ordi- 
nary grammar schools and middle schools, and who have also listened to the lessons 
given by trained teachers in the elementary schools, are struck by the contrast, by 
the freshness, the skill, and the variety of illustration to be found in the one, and 
the dullness, the mechanism, and the mere memory work which often characterize the 
other. Relatively to the subjects he has to teach, there can be little doubt that, as 
arule, the trained elementary teacher is the better craftsman. 
(4) It should be observed, however, that a large proportion of the time now devoted 
to study in the training colleges is necessarily devoted to the first of the purposes 
enumerated in paragraph 2, owing to the imperfect education generally possessed by 
the candidates on admission. It is evident that if the students already possessed, 
or were obtaining in some other way, an adequate acquaintance with the ordinary 
subjects included in the course of education in all liberal professions alike, the 
problem would be much simplified, and the time devoted to special normal training 
might be greatly reduced. 
(5) The education department has lately recognized the distinction between gen- 
eral and purely professional qualifications by means of new regulations, e. g.: 
(a) By dividing the requirements of the syllabus for the certificate examination 
into two distinct sections, Part I including reading, recitation, school manage- 
ment, music, tho principles and practice of teaching, and (for girls) needlework and 
domestic economy; and Part II comprising history, literature, language, mathemat- 
ies, geography, and science, the usual subjects of an advanced course of general 
instruction. 
(b) By retaining in the hands of the department the examination in Part I, and 
by providing as follows, for all students who may furnish other and satisfactory 
evidence of their proficiency in the general or academic subjects: 
“Students in training colleges who pass in any British university an examination 
approved by the department will not be required to present themselves for examina- 
tion in those portions of Part II of this syllabus which were included in that univer- 
sity examination.” 
(c) By recognizing as day training colleges a new class of instituting = vOnael 
classes or departments attached to provincial or other colleges of university rank, 
in which the students are placed under special instruction in pedagogy from a nor- 
mal master or mistress, and are so prepared to pass the department’s own examina- 
tion in Part I; while receiving, in common with other students who are not intending 
to become teachers, instructiqn from the college professors in the literary and scien- 
tific subjects included in Part II. 
(6) These proposals have materially modified and are likely in the near future to 
affect still more significantly the whole problem of training for elementary teachers. 
Nearly all the most important academic bodies in England and Wales, including the
-P-A-G-E-739
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 682 
University of Cambridge, King’s and University colleges in London, and Owen’s 
College, Manchester, have expressed their willinguess to cooperate with the educa- 
tion department on the basis of its new regulations, and have made arrangements 
satisfactory to that department for the due instruction and practice of those of their 
students who desire to become teachers. Liberal grants are now made by the 
department in respect both to the instruction and the maintenance of such students 
during their two-years course. There are now, in addition to 43 residential colleges, 
14 day training colleges of this new type. In the colleges of the former class there 
are 1,384 men and 1,961 women, and in the day colleges 284 men and 276 women, but 
this latter number is likely to be substantially increased ere long. 
(7) Itis too early to estimate the comparative merits of these two classes of institu- 
tions, or to forecast the probable effect of the introduction of a new class of trained 
agents into the ranks of the elementary teachers, Until we know how the young 
people trained under the new conditions shall have been found to compare with the 
existing teachers, not only in attainments but in character, sympathy with the 
work, and general moral influence, the data for the formation of an accurate judg- 
ment are not before us, and it would be premature to hazard an opinion. It may, 
however, be said that while I have good reason to appreciate the great merits of the 
residential colleges, the excellence of much of the teaching, and the guarded and 
careful discipline which at a very critical age is provided for the students, I have 
long been conscious of some disadvantages in the seminary system. In a commu- 
nity composed exclusively of young people who are of the same age and the same 
previous experience, who are looking forward to the same future career, and who are 
taught for the most part by persons similarly trained, there is, as I have said in offi- 
cial reports, a want of breadth and freedom, and an inevitable closeness in the intel- 
lectual atmosphere. The students are all working with the same syllabus in view; 
they see little beyond it, and they have scarcely any opportunity of comparing what 
they know with tho standard of a liberal education as it is recognized in other pro- 
fessions. On the other hand, the students in the day colleges lead a freer life, they 
are earlier taught to feel responsibility for the employment of their own time, and 
the conditions under which they receive their general instruction are in some respects 
more favorable to breadth of vision, self-knowledge, and general culture. There is 
of course, however, less security for moral and religious discipline, less of comrade- 
ship and of opportunity for mutual help. It should be added that in America, 
Germany, and France, as well as in Scotland, most of the normal students reside at 
their own homes, and attend the college by day only. It is undetstood that diffi- 
culties respecting the conduct or discipline of the students are very rarely found to 
arise from this cause. 
(8) The whole of the existing system of training colleges in this country, whether 
for day or residential students, presupposes that the large majority of the candidates 
have passed through their period of apprenticeship as pupil-teachers, and have 
reached the age of 18. Hence the two years’ course of normal instruction is so 
planned as to be suitable for students in their nineteenth and twentieth years. But 
it is manifest that where the pupil-teacher system does not exist other arrangements 
may be expedient. In the normal colleges of America, and in most continental 
countries, students are admissible at 16. They are not, however, required to enter 
on the practice of teaching in schools until the later years of their course. 
(9) If it be deemed expedient to make use of the experience which has been 
gained in the domain of elementary instruction, and to adopt, with needful mod- 
ifications, some analogous measures for the better preparation and equipment of 
secondary teachers, it would appear that two of the most effective means of attain- 
« ing this object are (1) the further development of the existing normal departments 
in the provincial and other day colleges, and (2) the more direct action and influence 
of the universities. 
(10) In regard to the former of these expedients, it happens that my last report to 
the education department contains one or two passages which were written in antici- 
ED 95. 22*  
-P-A-G-E-740
  682 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
pation of some such inquiry as that on which the commission is now engaged. I 
need not, therefore, apologize for reproducing the arguments in this place: 
(11) “I look forward with strong hope to a further development, in the near 
future, of the usefulness of the day training colleges. The need for some form of 
professional preparation for the teachers in secondary schools is likely to be more 
and more strongly felt every year. It isa trite thing to say that teaching is a fine 
art; that it has its rules and laws; that those rules have their true justification in 
psychology and in the constitution of human nature; that there are right and wrong 
methods of disciplining’and handling a class, of presenting truth to a learner’s 
mind, of organizing a school, and of economizing the time and power of the teacher; 
and that there are reasons to be given why some are right and others are wrong. 
These are elementary truths which have been long recognized in connection with 
the teaching in our primary schools. But although they are applicable to all schools 
alike, they have hitherto received scant recognition in the sphere of secondary and 
higher instruction. Already, however, the universities of Cambridge and London 
have taken measures to encourage intending teachers to study the art and philoso- 
phy of teaching and the best educational literature. By some of the most distin- 
guished head masters of public schools, and by such governing bodies as the council 
of the Girls’ Public Day Schools Company, those candidates for appointment who 
possess the teachers’ diploma are ceteris paribus preferred, and are found in practice 
to have a great advantage over others who, though well equipped with knowledge, 
have never given any heed to the art of communicating what they know. Yet the 
aspirant to the calling of a secondary or public school-teacher may complain with 
reason that however he may desire systematic guidance and preparation before 
entering upon his work, he does not know where to look for it. The existing resi- 
dential training colleges are not epen to him; and the only attempts made in Eng- 
land to establish a training institution for secondary schoolmasters proved to be a 
failure. Schoolmistresses have from the first shown a keener perception of the need 
of professional education than their brothers, but the supply of such training, even 
for them, is lamentably inadequate. The Maria Grey College at Brondesbury, the 
Cambridge Training College for Women, the department for student-teachers in 
the famous Ladies’ College at Cheltenham, and the nongovernment department 
at the Home and Colonial Training College, are the only resources Known to me by 
which gentlewomen who wish to qualify themselves as teachers in intermediate and 
higher schools can obtain systematic instruction. 
(12) “In these circumstances, the establishment of normal departments in the 
great provincial colleges of university rank in England and Wales, and the encour- 
aging success which has already been attained in those institutions, open out an 
opportune and most hopeful prospect. It is not likely that new institutions 
expressly designed like the first two just named will be multiplied even for women. 
Still less is it likely that any such institutions will be successfully established for 
men. Nor is it quite clear that it would be desirable. Neither in France nor 
America, nor in any country known to me, is it the practice to require special train- 
ing in anormal seminary in the case of candidates for teacherships in higher schools. 
Such seminaries are indeed needed for primary teachers, because the general educa- 
tion of the class from which they are drawn is deficient, and because, in fact, three- 
fourths of the time spent in those seminaries is required for instruction in Janguage, 
literature, history, and mathematics, subjects which form essential parts of every 
system of general education and are required in all liberal professions alike. Pre- 
sumably the young student who is destined to become a teacher in a high school has 
acquired all this in some college or university. What he wants is a special course of 
pedagogic instruction and practice, as a technical supplement to his general studies, 
analogous to that which would be needed if he contemplated law or medicine as his 
career. And this special preparation wiil probably be best found, not in an institu- 
tion composed exclusively of persons whose whole studies are directed by a syllabus, 
and with a view to a professional examination, but in a separate normal department
-P-A-G-E-741
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 683 
in a good general college, wherein for six or twelve months he may devote himself 
mainly to a study of the principles and methods of education, and to systematic 
practice, under due supervision and criticism, in one or more good schools. 
(13) “Now, this is precisely the want which the institutions, now newly recog- 
nized by your lordships as day training colleges, have it in their power to supply. 
The authorities of these institutions have already become interested in the profes- 
sional training of teachers. They have seen the advantage of the practical lessons 
in school management, and of the theoretical study of methodology which your 
lordships’ regulations prescribe for the future masters and mistresses of elementary 
schools. They have taken pains to comply with those regulations by appointing a 
master of method. Besides this, in several cases, notably at Bristol, Nottingham, 
and Cardiff, one of the most eminent professors gives to the normal students a 
special course of lectures on so much of logic, ethics, and mental philosophy as has 
a direct bearing on the art of teaching. And it has thus become evident that, muta- 
tis mutandis, much of the same discipline would prove of great value to the teachers 
of secondary and higher schools. Some modifications would necessarily be made. 
Much of the student’s practice, though not the whole of it, might fitly be obtained 
in the best secondary or grammar schools in the neighborhood, and the course of 
theoretical and practical studies would be guided rather by the curriculum set forth 
by the Cambridge syndicate or the London University senate than by the syllabus 
of the education department. 
(14) ‘One experiment in this direction is about to be mado in connection with the 
University College at Nottingham. The following is an extract from the public 
announcement recently put forth by the authorities of that institution: 
“UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, NOTTINGHAM. 
“Proposed courses on the science and history of education in connection with the examina- 
tions under the teachers’ training syndicate (Cambridge University). 
“The great advance which has been made in educational matters during the last 
twenty years renders it more necessary than ever that a teacher should possess a 
sound knowledge of the science of education, as well as proficiency in the art, if he 
or she is to attain to the highest success in the profession. 
“That the education department has fully recognized this is shown by the fact 
that during the last ten years candidates for the certificate examination have been 
expected to show an acquaintance with the elementary principles of psychology and 
logic, in addition to their practical knowledge. 
“«Two of our universities (London and Cambridge) have for some years past recog- 
nized the importance of this department of knowledge by granting a diploma to all 
candidates who succeed in passing their examinations in the theory, history, and 
practice of teaching. The London examination is, however, open only to graduates, 
and hence many teachers are unable to avail themselves of its advantages. At Cam- 
bridge, on the other hand, the regulations are much more elastic. 
“It is proposed, therefore, to establish a course of lectures at University College, 
Nottingham, in order to prepare for this examination. The course will be on Fri- 
days from 7 to 8, and will be continued in the third term. The fee will be 5s. per 
term. 
“The main purpose of the course is to enable teachers to obtain a wider and more 
complete knowledge of the science and history of education. 
(15) “In the prospect of any further measures which may attach added impor- 
tance to the professional qualifications of teachers in allranks, or which may provide 
for the registration of such qualifications, it may be expected that the precedent thus 
to be established at Nottingham will prove to be so useful and successful as to be 
extensively followed. Grants from the education department will, of course, neither 
be needed nor asked for on behalf of the additional students received under the new 
conditions, and such students will take university diplomas and not Government

certificates. But men and women who shall have availed themselves of these new 
provisions are likely to be distinguished by a truer and broader conception of the 
teachers’ art, and to exercise greater skill in practicing it. Their possible influence 
on the views and aims which may prevail in the higher ranks of the teachers’ profes- 
sion can not easily be estimated at present, but it can not fail to be beneficial, and 
I do not doubt that teachers so qualified will be able to render exceptional public 
service. 
(16) “‘Any such extension of the training system to secondary teachers will bring 
into view the subject of practicing schools—their supply, their relation to the work 
of training, and the use which should be made of them. It may be well, therefore, 
to put on record here the result of such experience as has been gained in connection 
with the colleges already aided and inspected by the department. A fear has often 
been expressed that it would be difficult to find proper provision for the practical 
work of secondary school masters and mistresses, owing to the disturbance which 
would be caused in the schools and to the unwillingness of the head teachers 
to allow a class to be made a corpus vile on which experiments should be tried. 
This fear I believe to be groundless. No doubt the presence of one or two teachers 
who are not on the regular staff interferes a little with the organization, and renders 
necessary, on the part of the head teacher, some slight adjustment of his plans. But 
this trifling disadvantage is much more than compensated by the greater freshness, 
life, and variety which are introduced into the school work by teachers presumably 
interested in learning their profession and anxious to distinguish themselves. It is 
a familiar result of experience that there is a higher general level of intelligence in 
schools which are frequented for purposes of students’ practice than in ordinary 
schools. This is so strongly felt in many places that there is often a competition 
among*the head teachers for the privilege of receiving the visits of the students. 
The boards at Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle, and Sheffield, and other towns 
place the best of their schools at the disposal of the college authorities, and the 
teachers regard it as an honor when their schools are selected. I always ask the 
masters and mistresses whether they find the presence of the students a help or a 
hindrance, and the answer is almost invariably satisfactory. The head teachers are 
pleased to have additional influence and opportunities of usefulness; they often give 
very valuable counsel to the students, and almost without exception they fill up the 
returns connected with the conduct and teaching powers of the several students in 
a way which shows insight and sympathy, and furnishes valuable help to the college 
authorities.” (Report of Committee of Council for 1892-93, pp. 159-161.) 
(17) In each of two Scotch universities—Edinburgh and St. Andrew’s—a special 
professorship in education has been founded by the trustees of Dr. Andrew Bell’s 
estate. In Cambridge occasional lectures on the science and history of education 
have been given, and a syndicate has been formed with power to institute examina- 
tions and to recommend the granting by the university of special diplomas to intend- 
ing teachers. The University of London has also instituted similar examinations, 
the conditions differing in only two main particulars from those of Cambridge, viz, 
(1) in requiring that none but persons who have already taken a degree shall be 
candidates, and (2) in insisting that all candidates shall pass the practical as wellas 
the theoretical part of the examination. But it can not be said that at present any 
English university has taken seriously in hand the professional training of the 
schoolmaster as an integral and organized department of its academic work. 
(18) It is universally admitted that the first duty of a university, to all its stu- 
dents alike, is to give general, not special or professional, education, literee humani- 
ores, the learning which has no visible or immediate relation to the mode whereby a 
man is to get his living, but which helps him to live and to spend his life worthily. 
A secondary purpose has, however, always been recognized as legitimately within 
the scope of a university. This purpose may be described as that of ennobling and 
liberalizing the higher professional employments and preventing them from degen- 
erating into trades. Accordingly schools of law, of divinity, of medicine, and even
-P-A-G-E-743
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 685 
of engineering have found their appropriate places in the organization of univer- 
sities, and rewards and honors have been awarded to successful students. These 
students have been for the most part pursuing post-graduate courses and supple- 
menting the general knowledgo represented in the ordinary degree by the special 
reading and exercises appropriate to their several professions. Now, itis much to be 
desired that the profession of teaching should be placed in a similar position. It 
is the calling to which large and constantly increasing numbers of graduates are 
intending to devote themselves, and for which they have at present little opportu- 
nity to qualify themselves. It is not unreasonable that they should look to their 
alma mater for some help and guidance before undertaking their life’s work. A 
school or tripos of education might, as a first step, be established. ‘‘Pedagogy,” it 
may be remarked in passing, is an ugly word, to which the ear of the English publie 
is not yet reconciled, although it or its equivalent is generally accepted and under- 
stood in France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States, and can, therefore, 
hardly be avoided. The late Professor Pillans preferred the term ‘didactics.” If 
the universities were once induced to undertake the work, the establishment of an 
honor examination on this subject would require to be supplemented by the appoint- 
ment of a lecturer or professor, qualified not only by his theoretical and practical 
knowledge and his power of exposition, but also by actual acquaintance with some 
of the best methods in use both in English and foreign schools. It would also be 
necessary for the professor and the university to be placed in such relations to the 
heads of some of the best public schools of different types as might insure for all the 
students ample opportunities of practice under observation. Diplomas granted by 
the universities on such conditions would soon come to be highly valued, and would 
go far to create a strong public opinion in favor of training as an almost indis- 
pensable element in the qualification of teachers in all ranks. 
Some useful experiments have been tried in one or two public schools and in the 
Ladies’ College, Cheltenham, with a view to train “student teachers,” while on proba- 
tion, in the methods of conducting school work, and especially in giving class lessons. 
What is called in the State of Michigan and in other parts of the American Union 
the ‘‘cadet system” is planned on a similar principle. Both methods may well 
deserve fuller examination than they have yet received; but it will probably be 
found that neither can be regarded as more than a temporary and imperfect expe- 
dient, and that both fall far short of providing the instruction in the art and princi- 
ples of teaching which is required to make a skilled practitioner in that art. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN FRANCE. 
[By Mr. Herbert Ward, B. A., ono of H. M. inspectors of schools, etc.?] 
“ The best feature of these (the French public secondary) schools seems to be their 
thoroughly trained and tested staff of professors.” So wrote Mr. Matthew Arnold in 
1868 after an account of the qualifications required in teachers of French secondary 
schools, and a glowing description of the higher normal school at Paris. It is here 
proposed to discuss this dictum and to examine its accuracy, especially in view of 
the more recent development of the French school system. 
What is to be understood by the “thorough training” of a teacher? As such 
training admittedly does not exist in England for teachers in secondary schools, 
even the necessity of it being denied by a great many, we are driven to seek an 
analogy from the elementary schools. 
In elementary education in England and France alike it means two things. A 
trained teacher is one who, in the first place, has been fully instructed in the mat- 
ters which he will have to teach. The certificate of the education department, 
granted to training-college students upon examination, and also to acting teachers, 
1 From vol. 5 of the Report of the Royal (English) Commission on Secondary Education.
-P-A-G-E-744
    686 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. Me : 
is a guarantee that the elementary teacher knows his English, arithmetic, geogra- 
phy, and what not; and the South Kensington certificates testify similarly to his 
possession of some knowledge of the branches of science and of that in which he has 
been examined. But ‘a trained teacher” connotes something more. The phrase 
implies that besides instruction in the matter of his teaching he has also received 
lessons in the method. In the English system of elementary education at the 
training colleges, and to a varying extent during the period of apprenticeship to 
pupil-teachers, regular courses of lessons are given in school method and school 
management, The same istrue of French normal schools. School method and man- 
agement embrace not only the details of the teaching of particular subjects, but also 
psychology and logic as applied to education and hints on the administration of 
schools. Lessons before elementary classes for the purpose of criticism are constantly 
given or heard by teachers under training, and model lessons are shown them by 
tho master of method. Moreover, they have practice in teaching in schools during 
the apprenticeship under the eye of a head master, during the training college 
course, under the direct and constant supervision of the method master. 
Of these two sections of the training of teachers, neither exists for secondary 
schoolsin England. There is no express provision for cultivation on the intellectual 
side for the man who would teach in a secondary school, still less is there any instruc- 
tion in the science and art of imparting knowledge on the theory of education. It 
will be found that in France there is a tolerably complete organization to secure the 
former—the intellectual training and testing of the future teacher—and so far Mr. 
Arnold’s saying is fully justified. But before it can be accepted as covering the sec- 
ond kind of training, in method, very considerable qualifications will have to be 
introduced. It is not within the scope of this memorandum to discuss the necessity, 
or otherwise, of the professional training, so to speak, of the teacher in secondary 
schools, but simply, in view of those who demand that there shall be some, to point 
out the state of things in France. 
It is desirable, by way of preliminary, to notice two or three contrasts and dis- 
tinctions, In the first place, secondary schools in France are divided into two well- 
marked classes, lyeées and colltges. The leading difference between the two is one 
of administration, for the lycées draw upon state funds, while the colleges are sup- 
ported upon municipal or communal funds. But besides this there is an important 
difference in prestige, a difference accentuated by governmental regulations as to the 
staffing, for the conditions of appointment of masters in communal colleges are not 
so severe as those which govern the appointment of masters in lycées. There is a 
special scheme of salaries for professeurs dé colldge distinct from that of the profes- 
seurs delycée. In general, the staff of a college will not be so distinguished as that 
of a lycée, and presumably the instruction will not be so good. Any generalization, 
then, concerning professors of lycées will not necessarily be true of professors of 
communal colleges, who until recently could not claim the title of professor. It is 
upon the former that the attention of foreign inquirers has usually been directed. 
It was of these professors that Mr. Matthew Arnold was chiefly thinking when he 
spoke of a ‘‘thoroughly trained and tested staff of professors.” But, having in view 
the number of communal colleges, we can not overlook the large body of teachers in 
them without grave danger of misconception. 
Another important distinction, which illustrates also a curious contrast to English 
methods, exists in the staff of all public secondary schools, whether they are state or 
communal schools. Most of them are on the boarding system. In England this 
would entail increased work upon resident masters in the way of ‘house duty.” In 
France, on the contrary, the teacher has not (except accidentally in small communal 
colleges) any house duty whatever. When his teaching work is over he is com- 
pletely free, and all supervision, whether of private study, preparation, orrecreation, 
is undertaken by a body of ushers, who are called variously maitres d’étude or maitres 
répétiteurs. The ushers, of whom there are some even on the staff of those schools 
which receive only day boys, are usually men who are reading for a higher degree or

certificate than the one they must possess. They dono teaching work, except in the 
case of the best qualified, who give help in preparation, and except, upon emergency, 
when they may be called upon to fill a temporary vacancy. But from their number 
are recruited to a very considerable extent the masters in the communal colleges 
and smaller provincial lycées. They, too, therefore, although not, while in the exer- 
cise of their proper functions, teachers, must be taken into account in any discussion 
upon teachers in French secondary schools, A third distinction to be noticed is that 
between the elementary division of a secondary school and the two higher divisions. 
While the qualifications for masterships in the higher divisions almost necessarily 
presuppose an education in a secondary school, certain specially qualified primary 
schoolmasters, who have very rarely passed through a secondary school, are admitted 
to teach in the classes of the elementary division. There is also a special certificate 
qualifying the holder to teach such classes in tho lycées, a certificate well within tho 
reach of a primary schoolmaster. The elementary division, it should be said, pre- 
pares boys to begin a secondary education proper in the division de grammaire, and 
its course hardly differs from that of the primary school, except in the important 
addition of a modern language. But the division is so integral a part of most 
schools, except the highest Parisian lycées, that its professors should be included in 
our survey. A still lower division, which may be found in some schools, is the divi- 
sion of primary classes, but for practical purposes there is no need to consider it apart 
from the elementary division. 
These distinctions being clear, the intellectual training of teachers in French sec- 
ondary schools may now come under discussion. I deal at present with the classical 
lycées and colleges for boys—the most numerous and oldest of public secondary 
schools—leaving for subsequent treatment the “modern” departments and schools for 
boys and the girls’ schools. Admission to the various functions is an affair of degrees 
and certificates, and all masters (except the répétiteurs) are appointed by the minis- 
ter of public instruction, who selects his candidate from a list of persons competent 
for the post which is vacant. 
There are two main degrees which concern the future professor, the degtee of bach- 
elor (bachelier) and that of licentiate (licencié), which Mr. Arnold roughly compares 
to the English bachelor and master of arts, respectively. The degree of bachelor 
admits its possessor to the functions of répétiteur or préparateur (a higher kind of 
usher, whose work is sufficiently indicated by the name) in a college, and also, after 
ashort probationary period, to the same post in alycée, It further enables a man 
to take provisional charge of a class in the higher divisions of a college, though not 
the “titular professor” of the class. The licentiate may be titular professor in a 
college, but only provisionally in charge of a class in alycée. In order to be full or 
titular professor in a lycée, the licentiate must have competed for and won the title 
of ‘“‘agrégé,” a peculiar scholastic distinction, an explanation of which is for the 
present postponed. The difference between a full or titular professor (professeur 
titulaire) and the provisional professor (chargé de cours) is not only one of prestige; 
the titular professor is a sort of form master acknowledged, and his tenure of office 
is secure, whereas the chargé de cours may be removed to make way for one qualified 
to take the permanent post. And also, as salaries in French secondary schools vary 
according to qualification and experience, there may be an important difference in 
the stipends of a titular and a merely provisional professor. In spite of the insecu- 
rity, there are often more provisional than titular professors in the remoter colleges 
and lycées where the fully qualified teacher can not be induced tosettle. In the ele- 
mentary division the special certificate of fitness alluded to before admits to the 
best posts, those in the lycées; but to be provisionally in charge of elementary 
classes in lycées and to be full professor in colleges the bachelor’s degree is sufficient, 
or the certificate of a primary head master. For primary classes, primary schoolmas- 
ters and schoolmistresses are usually drafted in from their schools. 
The possession of diplomas and certificates, upon which the French so emphatically 
insist, is at any cate some guaranty of intellectual capacity in the teacher, as Mr. 
 
-P-A-G-E-746
  688 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Arnold pointed out. The degree of intelligence involved in the diplomas needs some 
further elucidation. Leaving aside the certificates of teachers of elementary classes, 
which imply a good higher grade elementary education, with the addition of a for- 
eign language in some cases, we may broadly say that the first condition of entering 
the profession of teaching in secondary schools is the possession of the bachelor’s 
degree. How far, then, does this degree correspond to what is commonly required, 
though not, as in France, legally necessary, in a secondary school-teacher in England, 
a university pass degree? The examination consists of two parts, both founded on 
tho work done in the upper division of a secondary school. The first part, which 
embraces the programme of the upper division as far as and including that of the top 
form but one (classe de rhétorique) is compulsory on all candidates. It consists chiefly 
in Latin, Greek, French, history, and one modern language. It appears to me to cor- 
respond roughly to the intermediate examination in arts at the London University, 
or to the matriculation examination of those colleges at Oxford and Cambridge 
where some strictness is exercised. In the second part, which covers the work done 
in the highest form (classe de philosophie), there is, to a certain extent, liberty of 
choice, The subject being philosophy and its history, mathematics, physics, and 
chemistry, the candidate can emphasize, which he will by choosing to be examined 
on paper in one and orally in the rest. As the whole examination is well within the 
reach of an average boy of 18 in the top form, it should be below rather than above 
such examinations as the London and Victoria universities’ pass B. A.and the M.A. 
of the Scotch universities. It would seem, then, that the minimum qualification 
necessary for the teacher in a French secondary school is nearly the same as in prac- 
tice is required in England. But while in England a pass degree can be won and is 
frequently won by men who have had no secondary school education, for example, 
an elementary schoolmaster, it would be more difficult to gain a French degree by 
mere private study. Hence it is that few primary schoolmasters in France enter the 
secondary schools by this gate, while, on the contrary, in England the number is not. 
inconsiderable. 
It is to be remarked that there is nothing in the regulations to prevent a bachelor 
from teaching the highest forms in a communal college, although, according to the 
distinction already explained, he would not be recognized as “filling the chair,” but 
only as a provisional substitute for a titular professor. But, whatever be legally pos- 
sible in practice, the teacher in a communal college must possess the degree of licen- 
tiate. That this degree and not that of the bachelor is the real teacher’s diploma is 
abundantly shown in the official “programmes” and instructions. In the preamble 
to the regulations for the licentiate’s examination weread: ‘‘ The knowledge required 
of the candidate is that which is obtained in secondary education, with the difference 
that at the baccalauréat the examining body is questioning a pupil, at the licentiat 
it has before it a future professor destined shortly to take charge of a class.” Accord- 
ingly the syllabus is drawn up to meet the intellectual requirements of the intend- 
ing teacher. ‘He must show that he knows everything that is necessary to conduct 
the lessons with which he will be intrusted as a master in a secondary school.” 
“The establishment of a licentiate’s degree in history and geography is intended to 
furnish our colleges and even in certain cases our lycées with professors of geography 
and history who have received, along with a genuine literary culture, a training in 
history and geography.” The inferior degree involved an examination on the whole 
classical curriculum. In the higher degree of licentiate there is specialization on 
the lines of the specialization of functions in a secondary school. Thus, there are 
“licenses” on the letters side in philosophy, in letters, in history and geography, 
and one also with special mention of modern languages; on the science side there 
are subdivisions parallel to the subdivisions of the work in science and mathematics 
in the school. In each caso what is required is a more extended acquaintance with 
onc of the departments of knowledge embraced in the syllabus for the baccalauréat, 
It is not necessary to give the programmes in full. My impression is that the licen- 
tiate’s examination in letters (i. e., pure classics, with the important addition of
-P-A-G-E-747
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 689 
French classics) corresponds broadly with the London University B. A. examination 
(honors in classics) or the honor school of classical moderations at Oxford. It will 
be seen that work for this degree is university work rather than school work. It is 
ordinarily taken by those who are in attendance on courses at university centers. 
But attendance is habitually excused in the pupils of the higher normal school, and 
exemption is readily obtained by those who are actually engaged in teaching or 
supervising while reading for their degree. 
I have dealt so far with the qualifications of teachers in communal colleges chiefly ; 
there remains the qualification of the full professor in lycée. ‘The titular professor 
in a lyeée must be “agrégé.” This coveted title is not a degrec, because it is given 
after competition and not after public examination, The number of “agrégés” 
in a particular year depends upon the needs of the lycées, so far as those needs 
can be foreseen. Thus, though the distinction is enthusiastically termed ‘the 
crowning and final consecration of the studies of our young professors, the ‘“agré- 
gation” by its very nature can not be reached by the great body of teachers in 
French secondary schools. There is no precise English equivalent to the ‘“agré- 
gation.” By some it is compared with the fellowship; but while there may be, 
approximately, the same severity in the tests, there are few other points in common. 
A teacher may be “agrégé” in any of eight orders—philosophy, letters (higher), his- 
tory and geography, grammar (lower. letters), modern languages, mathematical 
sciences, physical sciences, and natural sciences. There is no special syllabus issued. 
In his own subject the candidate is expected to display not only thorough knowledge 
but even erudition. A professeur agrégé is regarded so much as an expert in his own 
department that under certain circumstances he may be intrusted with supplementary 
courses at a university center. For the present purpose there is no need to do more 
than emphasize the necessarily restricted number of those who are ‘provided with 
the title of agrégé,” and to insist upon the extreme severity of the test. 
It will be seen from the foregoing that so far as guaranties of intellectual capac- 
ity are concerned the French system of choosing their secondary schoolmasters 
leaves little to be desired. To supervise in schools of both first and second rank, 
and on occasion to teach in those of second rank, tho degree of bachelor is required, 
a certificate which testifies to a sound secondary education. Usually before teaching 
in communal colleges, necessarily before teaching in lycées, a ‘university degree,” 
as it would be called in England, the degree of licentiate, is demanded; and this isa 
warrant of special proficiency in some one branch of letters or science. The picked 
men of the profession, who have charge of the classes in schools of the first rank, 
must possess the teacher’s diploma of ‘‘agrégation.” 
We may now turn to the “training” of the teacher in the narrower sense of pro- 
fessional instruction in method. From certain public utterances of English educa- 
tionalists it appears to bo expected that in the French system there is much that is 
worth imitating. 
In the preparation for the bachelor’s degree there is, absolutely no professional 
instruction. Indeed, it is not to be looked for, seeing that the baccalauréat merely 
puts an appropriate finish on a course of education in a secondary school and does 
not contemplate any specialization of function whatever. Moreover, for teachers it 
is really only preliminary to the licentiat. No doubt a large number, on the staff of 
colleges especially, have nothing more than this leaving certificate, but in great part 
they aro répétiteurs, doing very little teaching work and themselves studying for 
some more valuable diploma. 
It is more important to observe that in the preparation for the teacher's degree, 
that of licentiate, there is practically no professional instruction. The theory of 
teaching has no place in the syllabus and the question of method does not seem to 
be raised at all in the official programmes. The examination is purely a test of 
knowledge of subjects and not of educational theory or professional skill. There is 
one important reservation to be made, however, in view of 2 comparatively recent

development. This is the institution of university bursarships (bourses de faculté) 
with the avowed end of enabling moro of those who devote themselves to secondary 
teaching to obtain the grades which will qualify them for higher posts. ‘The 
establishment of bursaries is specifically intended to supply men who have the 
degree of licentiate to those colleges which have none so qualified. * * * The 
State wishes to aid especially those young people who, while possessing an inclina- 
tion toward teaching, may be prevented from want of sufficient means from attend- 
ing the lectures in the faculties.” (Quotation from circular of September 8, 1879.) 
The bursarships are tenable for one year at a university center and are given usually 
upon examination. The number is restricted according to the probable requirements 
of tho staffing of secondary schools. What is important from the point of view of 
the training of teachers is that special classes are held in the various faculties to 
prepare men for the licenciat; and to them are admitted not only the bursars, but 
also such répétiteurs, maitres d’étude, maitres auxiliaires, and auditeurs libres as 
may be free at the hours when the lectures are delivered. In a circular dated Octo- 
ber 25, 1888, the success of the bursaries is stated with some natural satisfaction; 
they are now recognized as almost a “succursale” or branch of the higher normal 
school. In the same circular I find a full acknowledgment of the necessity of 
instructing teachers in secondary schools in the science of teaching. But nothing 
follows more than general recommendations. The university professors aro asked to 
lecture upon the pedagogic aspect of their subjects and to talk familiarly with their 
pupils on questions connected with their fature work. How far this general instruc- 
tion leads the university professor to give hints on teaching his own subject will 
depend very largely on the amount of time at hisdisposal and on the idiosynerasy of 
the professor. Moreover, the students are to visit lycées during school hours, when 
possible and where, in order to observe the methods and class management of the 
eminent professors who will be willing to admit them. Here again we haverathera 
counsel of perfection than a rule that can not be infringed. No hard-and-fast regu- 
lation has been made since 1888 for “boursiers de licence,” and I understand that 
visits of observation or service in school with them is a matter of option. The possi- 
bility of such visits will naturally vary in the different centers according to tho zeal 
of the authorities and the readiness of the professors in lycées to admit aspirants 
into their classes. In Paris, where the organization of professional training is more 
complete than elsewhere, though it is still in a rudimentary state, bursars reading 
for the degree of licentiate are not regularly sent into schools for practice and obser- 
vation. It is highly improbable that provincial centers will be before Paris in this 
matter. There are courses of lectures on education at some university centers, at 
Paris, Lyons, Bordeaux, and Toulouse. In Paris they are given by M. Marion, the 
professor of the science of education; at the other places they are delivered as sup- 
plementary courses to the ordinary series on philosophy. M. Marion’s lectures are 
partly public, when they deal rather with the broad questions of education in gen- 
eral likely to interest others besides teachers, and partly restricted to members, 
actual and prospective, of the teaching profession. Of the latter, one course is open 
to the boursiers de licence, if they like to attend. It is frequented by a mixed 
auditory consisting of teachers and aspirants of almost all grades, a very large pro- 
portion being primary masters and mistresses. There is no formal series of addresses, 
but a discussion of various educational problems treated now by the professor and 
now by one of the class. By the very nature of the case, questions connected with 
secondary teaching in colleges and lycées, especially detailed questions of method, 
can find very little place in the discussion. For boursiers de licence, then, destined 
probably to teach in colleges, there is provided, even at Paris, only such limited 
pedagogic instruction as may be picked up from general lectures on education and 
teaching and from possible visits to schools. It is but fair to add that many of 
these bursars, when they have got their degree, proceed with renewed bursaries to 
study for the agrégation, the pedagogic aspect of which may now come under 
treatment.
-P-A-G-E-749
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 691 
The professional training and testing, so much to seek in the preparation for the 
two degrees of bachelor and licentiate, appears in the agrégation. “The agréga- 
tion,” we are authoritatively told, “is to furnish to the young professors an oppor- 
tunity of showing their capacities in the way of crudition, as well as their fitness 
for teaching. * * * Itis of importance, then, to preserve its professional char- 
acter.” The examination for the title of agrégé comprises two distinct portions. 
The first, called the preliminary test, consists of written compositions of a very 
advanced order, but very rarely concerned with educational questions. The second, 
or final test, includes viva voce explanations of passages of authors, lessons, and 
practical exhibitions of teaching skill. As this is the nearest approach, so far, to a 
definite professional examination, details will not be out of place. In the agrégation 
de lettres, for example, there are three sections of the final test: 
(1) The translation and explanation of passages from authors in Latin and Greek 
and comments upon a French text. The authors chosen are indicated a year before- 
hand, and hence no preparation is allowed for this test at the examination. ‘The 
candidates must offer all the remarks upon each text that explanation in class would. 
call for.” 
(2) Explanation of a passage of Greek or Latin taken from the programme of 
secondary schools, with a literary and philological commentary. Twenty-four hours 
are allowed for preparation. ‘ 
(3) A lesson of an hour on some subject taken from classical literature, the sub- 
ject to be selected by lot from the syllabus of secondary schools. Twenty-four hours 
for preparation are allowed in this case also. 
Similarly, in the agrégation des sciences mathématiques the final tests are: 
(1) A lesson on “elementary mathematics,” after three hours of preparation, 
without access to books or notes. 
(2) A lesson on ‘special mathematics,” after four hours of preparation under the 
same conditions. 
Such tests as the foregoing at least imply that the candidates have devoted some 
personal reflection to the question of teaching. They further constitute a more or 
less definite acknowledgment of the necessity of pedagogic training for the second- 
ary schoolmaster; but no light is shed on what means are taken to secuteit. Asa 
matter of fact, candidates for the agrégation are prepared variously, by private 
study, by one of the faculties where he is a boursier, and lastly by the higher normal 
school. As to those in the first category, who are probably employed in school 
work, their practical experience will serve in place of formal instruction. For the 
bursars, who enjoy their ‘“ bénéfices” on almost the same terms as the bursars for 
the licenciat, there are the same facilities as these others possess—pedagogic instruc- 
tion, if the professor sees fit to mingle with his lectures counsels on the methods of 
teaching (and many do this toward the end of their course), for some a short period 
of service in a secondary school, and, in those centers where provision is made, the 
liberty to attend special lectures on education. In Paris, boursiers d’agrégation in 
their first year are sent into lycées to watch and help, according to circumstances, 
tho professors of the subjects they are studying. M. Marion, moreover, devotes a 
special series of lectures of an intimate character to candidates for agrégation, 
lectures in which theory is checked by the practice and observation just obtained in 
the schools. It used to be a condition of entering for the agrégation that a candi- 
date, unless he came from the higher normal school, must have served five years in 
a public secondary in some capacity, and it was held that such a probation was 
enough to afford all the training in professional aptitude that was needed. In the 
most recent programme, however, I can find no mention of the condition, and con- 
elude that, with the extension of the bourses de faculté, it has been suppressed. 
It is on the higher normal school, l’école normale supérieure, that the attention of 
educational reformers in England has been chiefly fixed. As an impression seems to 
be abroad that the higher normal school itself is an efficient instrument for supply- | 
ing and training all the secondary schoolmasters required in France, it is prema

while to describe the institution more in detail. To quote from an official docu- 
ment: “Tho higher normal school, established at Paris, is immediately dependent 
on the ministry of publicinstruction. Itis intended to train teachers for the various 
sections of classical secondary education and of higher education in the establish- 
ments of the State. It comprises two main divisions, of letters and of sciences. 
The school takes none but boarders. Tuition and keep are free. Admission to the 
higher normal school is given after a competition which takes place every year. 
The number of places is fixed by the minister in accordance with the requirements 
of education.” All pupils must bring a stamped document, containing a written 
undertaking to serve for ten years in some department of public instruction. The 
ordinary course of study lasts three years. The pupil must be a bachelor when he 
enters, and at the end of his first year he must gain the degrce of licentiate. The 
second year in the section of letters is usually considered to be devoted to the dis- 
interested pursuit of the higher branches of the study he has taken up; in the sec- 
tion of sciences, to the preparation for the licenciat in another branch. In the third 
year all prepare more definitely for the agrégation, though, as there is issued no full 
and formal plan d’études for this examination, preparation for it must consist in pro- 
found research rather thanin cramming. There is accommodation for over 100 pupils, 
and every year from thirty to forty are available for drafting into the schools. The 
intercourse in the classes seems to be of the most intimate description. The pupils 
are called upon to give lessons, especially in their third year, when the time of their 
entrance into the profession draws near. They are also to spend a fortnight in some 
lycée before leaving, a term considerably shortened from the six weeks that were 
originally required. The high opinion which the French have of this school—an 
opinion justly entertained, for from it have proceeded some of the most prominent 
savants of the century—must not prevent us from examining how far it comes up to 
the ideal of a training college for secondary teachers. 
In the first place, the pupils of the higher normal school form an aristocracy among 
French teachers. Not every one can win the coveted dignity of agrégé, and still 
fewer can pass through the higher normal school. The thirty or forty who obtain 
admission each year are the pick of the lycées. As the numbers are so small, 
the normaliens can not supply all the places vacant in all colleges and lycées in 
France; and, indeed, they usually consider it a misfortune, if not an indignity, if 
they are not placed immediately on leaving in at any rate some important provincial 
lycée, Every lycée, it seems, counts among its teachers some ono or two agrégés at 
least, and no doubt many of them are pupils of the higher normal school. But these 
elect persons gravitate to Paris after a period of service in the provinces, and staff 
very completely the numerous lycées in the capital and the immediate neighborhood. 
Much indirect benefit, no doubt, accrues to the schools in which they are placed by 
the dispersion of even so few highly trained young men through France; but the 
higher normal school can not be considered, as once it could, as the main recruiting 
ground of the secondary school teachers in France. 
In the second place, the school does not pretend to be aschcol of pedagogy. There 
is apparently no study of educational methods as such, no investigation into the his- 
tory of education, and no stress laid upon psychology in its bearing upon education. 
A priori, one would expect that the highest institute for training the best equipped 
teachers would form a school of educational thought and research to which the busy 
schoolmaster would refer for inspiration and guidance. But the object of the school 
is undisguisedly erudition and personal cultivation. ‘‘Travailler pour soi, voila 
Vessentiel 4 V’école.” It is hardly concealed in public documents that admission to 
itis, as it were, an endowment of research, and panegyrists speak with enthusiasm 
of the possibility of working there for the pure love of study, untatnted by any 
baser motive. The idea of applying the methods of professional training in vogue 
in the primary normal colleges to secondary schoolmasters, even in a modified form, 
is yet of too recent a growth in France to have affected the higher normal school, 
It is held that, given extensive learning and a complete mastery of the subject you
-P-A-G-E-751
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 693 
have to teach, the ability to teach it will follow, and M. Marion himself, who can 
not be accused of underrating the value of pedagogic instruction, is of opinion that 
to these ‘jeunes gens d’élite” a few hints and counsels are all that is needed. It 
can hardly be considered that the service in school of a fortnight and the giving of 
lessons occasionally in the third year constitute any serious pedagogic training, 
when there is no ‘‘master of method” to superintend the lessons and no regular for- 
mal lectures in psychology and the theory of teaching are delivered. The courses of 
tho professor of the science of cducation, even so far as they are followed by the 
pupils of the higher normal school, are of too recent a foundation, and attendance is 
too much a voluntary matter for them to be said adequately to supply the deficit. 
In the whole, then, the higher normal school, though a unique institution and 
admirably adapted for the purpose, hardly corresponds to our preconceived ideas of 
a normal school, ideas formed from an experience of normal schools for primary 
schoolmasters. It is, indeed, a pépinitre or nursery, as it is so often called, where 
are reared professors for the greater lycées; and but as such, it trains and educates 
only the-favored few. Some friendly critics accuse it of no longer completely fulfill- 
ing the functions for which it was originally intended, of supplying masters for 
schools in the secondary instruction. A certain proportion of its pupils have con- 
stantly been drafted into the higher university education, A small number, some 
half dozen or so, are regularly kept on as assistants and demonstrators for two or 
even more years, in order to enable them to prepare for their doctorate, and then 
pass into the chair of faculties. Others, again, go to the higher special schools, such 
as those of Rome and Athens, while some, though not doctors, are employed as assistant 
or supplementary professors in faculties. Even many of the bulk who do actually 
teach for a time in the lycées ultimately recruit the ranks of university professors. 
But as the object of the school is officially announced to embrace the supply of pro- 
fessors for the higher establishment of the State as well as the secondary schools, the 
criticism that the school is being diverted from its proper purpose does not seem to 
have very much value. 
The masters of the elementary and primary divisions of a secondary school may 
now be considered. As above stated, the instruction in the divisions resembles 
primary instruction, with the important exception that a modern language is begun. 
The classes in the primary classes are generally under the charge of regularly trained 
primary-school masters and mistresses drafted for this purpose into secondary edu- 
cation. It may not be out of place to remark that their training involves a three 
years’ residence in a normal school, with regular lessons in pedagogy, a regular sys- 
tem of service in a practicing school. For elementary classes in communal colleges 
the certificates of a primary head master are required, i. e., the higher brevet won in 
the ordinary course of things at the end of the third year of the training college 
course, and the “‘certificat Vaptitude pédagogique.” It would seem that the regula- 
tions for the staffing of the lower division have not yet reached their final form. A 
comparatively new certificate, that of ‘fitness for teaching elementary classes,” is 
demanded of those who wish to be full professors of elementary classes in lycées. 
It is at this certificate that maitres d’étude with no ambition for a higher degree than 
that of bachelor and acting professor of lower classes chiefly aim. It is through it 
also that capable men pass from primary into secondary instruction, though there is 
very small hope of their rising above the elementary classes. Whether it be that 
the programme was inspired by those who look upon pedagogic instruction as impor- 
tant, as its recent origin suggests, or its framers had the theory that the less culti- 
vated a master the more is pédagogie required; at any rate the syllabus contains 
sufficient of the professional element to satisfy the most exacting. The written 
work includes compositions in the-form of lessons in French, history and geography, 
sciences and mathematics. The oral work comprises a viv’ voce explanation of a 
piece of French, a lesson-of twenty minutes on composition and the formation of 
sentences at the blackboard, a lesson of a quarter of an hour on geography, and

matics, and finally a personal examination on ‘the elementary principles of peda- 
gogy.” A quotation from the report of the board of examiners in 1892 will bo useful 
in view of the last oral test. ‘The questions are chosen among those which should 
be familiar to a good professor of elementary classes; they refer to the theory of edu- 
cation as wellas to the methods of teaching; they bear upon the interpretation of 
the syllabus and the government of a class. We choose them in advance, and the 
candidates draw them by lot. When] the questions have been treated in due form, 
they are followed by observations from the examining board, which corrects mistakes 
and clears up obseure points.” There is no provision for preparing candidates for the 
certificate; such preparation must all be private, Tho fact that not much more than 
10 per cent of the candidates are passed indicates that the certificate is to be mado 
as valuable as possible. The benevolently earnest anxiety that the professor shall 
Know how to teach his class contrasts strongly with the almost entire absence of 
any such precaution in the case of candidates for the licenciat and its comparative 
neglect even in the agrégation. 
One other certificate calls for a passing notice in a study of the training of French 
teachers. As tho licenciat is a necessary preliminary to the agrégations of letters 
and sciences, a ‘certificate of fitness for teaching modern languages” was estab- 
lished to stand in the same relation to the agrégation of modern languages. The 
possessor of the certificate may take provisional charge of a class in a lycée and full 
charge in a communal college. The examination does not necessitate a knowledge of 
Latin and Greek, and for this reason is often undergone by modern language tutors 
in primary normal schools. Among the conditions occur some which are of interest 
from a pedagogic point of view. A lesson is to be given in grammar in the modern 
language chosen. One of the written tests is a composition in French on some sub- 
ject connected with the “special pedagogy of modern languages.” I give a few 
examples of the questions and subjects. ‘What system of declension (in German) 
have you adopted in your classes, and why?” ‘Pronunciation and accent in a 
modern language class.” ‘The teaching of modern languages by the ear as opposed. 
to teaching by the eye.” ‘‘Expound in a general manner the method which seems to 
you the best for teaching the vocabulary in Spanish.” Although thereis no training 
school for modern languages, this emphasis laid upon the theory of teaching them 
can not fail, by causing candidates to reflect on their methods and to collect infor- 
mation, to increase the educational efficiency of the classes, 
Hitherto I have concerned myself with the ordinary or classical lyeées and col- 
leges. With appropriate alterations all that has been said is true of ‘‘modern” 
schools and the ‘‘modern sides” of classical schools—‘‘special secondary instruc- 
tion,” as it was until recently called. There is a baccalauréat at the end of the 
full course at one of these schools of relatively the same difficulty as the classical 
degree. There has been also, besides the degree of licentiate in sciences, a special 
“certificate of fitness for teaching in modern schools,” and a special order of agréga- 
tion. There was even a separate normal school (l’école de cluny) to train profes- 
sors for the enseignement spécial, and a certifieate for those who had passed through 
it. The school was suppressed a few years ago, and now from 1894 onward the pecu- 
liar certificate and agrégation’are also abolished. These measures do not constitute 
aneglect of the “modern” education, but rather an elevation of it; for the substi- 
tution of the scientific degrees and diplomas of the professors of classical lycées 
will be a better guaranty that modern schools shall have a staff of cultured men 
than a general examination in modern subjects, such as qualified for the old cer- 
tificate of fitness and the old agrégation. 
Lycées for girls require to be considered apart. They are strongly differentiated 
from lycées for boys by the threo facts that they were instituted so recently as 1880, 
that there was no staff of teachers already trained, and that in the curriculum Latin 
and Greek are omitted. Among other results following from these differences, the 
girls’ schools and teachers need much more direction and guidance, as there is no tra- 
dition of teaching such as exists in boys’ schools. In outline, the conditions of admis-
-P-A-G-E-753
  REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 695 
sion to the professorat are the same as for men. The leaving certificate of a girls’ 
secondary school is the equivalent for the bachelor’s degree, and it is noteworthy that 
instead of it a certificate from the primary normal school is accepted. Instead of 
the degree of licentiate, which involves a knowledge of Latin and Greek, there is 
substituted a “certificate of fitness for the teaching of girls.” The examination for 
it includes a lesson on history of half an hour’s duration, to be given after a prepa- 
ration of two hours; but this is the only pedagogic test. The certificate admits 
the holder to be chargée de cours only; to be full professor she must be agrégée. 
In the agrégation, which is divided into two parts, for the order of letters and for 
the order of sciences, respectively, professional tests have a larger place than in the 
corresponding competition for men. Thus, in the agrégation of letters, besides an 
oral explanation of a French text, there are three lessons—on history, on geography 
(with a sketch on the blackboard), and on morals. Moreover, a devoir, or pupil’s 
exercise in literature or grammar, is to be corrected orally before the béard of exam- 
iners. Occasionally in the written work essays are set on educational subjects. 
As the recruiting of the professorate of girls’ schools is still, so to speak, nursing, 
in the reports issued by the examining boards advice is freely offered to the aspi- 
rante on the method of giving the lessons, and admirable counsels are bestowed with 
the avowed object of ‘‘coaching” those who shall appear as candidates in the future, 
Most of the agregées come from the higher normal school for women at Sevres. 
This establishment, which was created in imitation of the school for men, differs 
from the latter in many respects. As the lycées for girls are not as yet by any means 
so numerous as those for boys, the training school is able to supply professors for 
vacancies to a far greater extent than in the higher normal school at Paris. Again, 
although the agrégation is by no means to be despised, it is not so hard, absolutely, 
as the agrégations for men, and as there are only the two orders of letters and science, 
the specialization of the men, and consequently the profounder study of a more lim- 
ited range of subjects is naturally out of the question. Thus the school of Sivres 
is not liable to many of the criticisms which may be fairly leveled at the higher 
normal school at Paris. Ican not discover that moro attention is paid to educa- 
tional methods and theory than at the other school; the facilities for attending the 
lectures of the Sorbonne on education are certainly far less. In the matters of con- 
ditions of admission, length of residence, terms of residence, and the engagement 
to serve in some department of public education the normal school for men is closely 
imitated. It is worthy of remark that while the men undertake to serve ten years 
simply, the women have an alternative form of engagement to complete the term 
of ten years originally promised in a primary training college. Many primary 
schoolmisiresses do, as a matter of fact, pass into secondary education by this and 
other means. The higher normal school at Stvres and the higher normal school at 
Foutenay-aux-Roses for training mistresses in primary normal colleges are often 
associated together. There is no essential difference in their respective programmes. 
But to compare the higher normal school at Paris with the normal school of St. Cloud 
for training tutors for primary normal colleges is out of the question, so radically 
different is men’s secondary education from men’s primary education. There is in 
the above indications sufficient evidence that on the side of the girls a much closer 
connection exists between primary and secondary education. 
There is one more point which deserves emphasis. Itmightseem from the descrip- 
tion of the professional training of the teachers in French secondary schools that 
after all it is confined chiefly to masters of elementary classes and women teachers, 
and even then it is restricted to private work tested by an examination; that in 
other cases it is casual and accidental, and that the great mass of teachers apart 
from the pupils of the normal school must be left without guidance except such as 
is supplied by their native intelligence. But to think so would be to lose sight of 
an important characteristic of French education in general, the abundance and 
fallness of programmes, and the extreme care with which they are drawnup. What- 
ever evils may be involved in strict organization, and however mechanical and arbi-
-P-A-G-E-754
696 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
trary some of the arrangements may seem, they have the advantage that they help 
the young professor in the outlines of his work and prevent him from wandering 
into indefiniteness. This is of more value because the head masters of lycées and 
communal colleges are not usually counted on the teaching staff; they have often 
done no teaching, and so can not assist a novice as an English head master who has 
probably mapped out the course of work for himself can assist a beginner. Ido 
not discover that the programmes prescribe too minutely what is to be done by the 
teacher, but to the untrained learner a little guidance is useful; and the directions 
of the programmes, coupled with the consultations in the ‘masters’ meetings,” 
recently made a general custom, willsaye many anerror. Perhaps also the fact that 
the syllabus is uniform forall public schools throughout France, fatal asit may seem 
to all individual and local developments unless there be a liberal interpretation of 
the regulations, will help rather than bewilder a man who has himself been educated 
in aschool similar to that in which he teaches and on lines very similar to those on 
which his pupils are being taught. In many cases not only is the syllabus care- 
fully drawn up, but advice is given how certain lessons should be conducted. 
There is constant emphasis, for example, on the necessity of avoiding merely verbal 
teaching in scienco and of using visible objects and specimens. Excursions to illus- 
trate the courses of geology and botany are recommended. In arithmetic tho exact 
point at which theoretical teaching should be introduced alongside of the practical 
teaching is carefully indicated. In the syllabus for girls’ schools a whole page is 
devoted to directions for teaching to read aloud. I should not omit to mention 
an admirable volume of instructions and counsels which was issued to all masters 
upon the publication of the revised syllabus of 890. The book is a finely written 
treatise on the outlines of teaching methods, and it deals with every department of 
the work in a secondary school. What lends an additional value to all these instruc- 
tions and programmes is that they are compiled by an educational council of 
experts, and not by a “‘department” of administrative officials. The council rep- 
resents every educational interest and every grade of teachers in France. The min- 
ister of public instruction issues his decrees in conformity with the council’s 
advice. The constitution of this body lends dignity to the teachers who are rep- 
resented, and they have the satisfaction of knowing that their work is mapped out 
for them by men on whose wisdom and experience they can rely. 
The military question has had considerable influence on the supply of primary 
schoolmasters. Before 1889 they were exempt from military service, and when the 
exemption was removed the necessary motive to decide many who wavered before 
entering on a career so little remunerative ceased to operate, and the numbers of 
candidates for the primary normal schools fell considerably. The same effect has 
not followed in secondary education. The degrees and diplomas which bar the 
entrance to the higher grades of the teaching profession acted before 1889 as suffi- 
cient impediments to any who desired to take up the work merely in order to avoid 
the year under the flag. Secondary teachers have been rare on exactly the same 
leyel as members of the other profession in regard to military service; under ordi- 
nary circumstances they must devote one year to military training. 
A few remarks may be made by way of summary and conclusion. As compared. 
with the state of things in England, the existence of a system of supplying teachers 
to secondary schools calls for comment. The care with which the terms of admission 
to the profession are drawn up, with their safeguards and checks and guaranties, 
can not but excite our admiration; for to have the methods of entrance so well 
organized is no small security for efficiency in education. If a man enters with his 
eyes open, knowing clearly the conditions under which he will serve and be pro- 
moted, he is much more likely to prepare himself for the work and to equip him- 
self with cverything that can make it successful. The deliberate choice of teaching 
as a career which is almost demanded by the French system must produce the most 
beneficial effect upon education; while if men drift into the profession or take it up 
 
-P-A-G-E-755
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 697 
until something better offers, no enthusiasm and scarcely honest and thorough work 
can be expected. 
Thero is little to find fault with in tho intellectual training of the future pro- 
fessor. The first requirement for a higher teacher is a sound secondary education 
and for a lower teacher a superior primary education. The distinguishing feature 
of both, as compared with their English equivalent, is the prominence given to the 
mother tongue and its literature. The second requirement in all but the lower 
teachers is some specialization. As the functions in all but the smallest colleges are 
themselves specialized, the teachers must be prepared accordingly. Hence the sub- 
divisions of the licentiate’s degree, and the eight orders of agrégation. In all depart- 
ments the teacher must have thoroughly mastered the subject he is to teach, and 
even, if possible, be an expert in it. One result of the specialization, as Mr. Arnold 
notices, is that it seldom happens that a teacher has to take a subject with which he 
is not familiar, and this must minimize the amount of inferior teaching. Much as 
we may admire the intellectual training of the secondary teacher in France, it must 
be confessed that the professional training is disappointingly ill-organized. That it 
is inadequate is conceded by those who are the most earnestly seeking to remedy its 
defects. There is indeed some testing of skill in teaching by examination; but 
little provision is mado that the candidate shall have been properly instructed. 
And as to the testing itself, there is the strange paradox that it takes place at the 
top and bottom of the hierarchy of teachers but not between. The distinguished 
agrégés are tested and so are the humble elementary masters, but for the average 
licentiate—that is, for the average professor in communal colleges and provincial 
lycées—there is not even a test for which he might prepare by personal reflection or 
investigation. In the primary system all masters and mistresses must pass through 
the normal school. In the secondary system this is neither necessary nor possible. 
Comparatively few enjoy the privileges of university preparation for the agrégation, 
and fewer still can enter the normal school. And even in the normal school itself 
there is very little professional training. The ardor of the students is directed 
toward purely intellectual pursuits. We do not, perhaps, expect that the normalien 
should have a dreary apprenticeship, but we do look for more attention to cduca- 
tional methods at so renowned a training center. The truth is that, coupled with a 
genuine conviction that the more cultivated a teacher is the less he needs of forma] 
instruction in method, there is a prejudice against pédagogie as applied to secondary 
schools. Pedagogic instruction is well for the less cultivated primary schoolmaster 
or lower-form master, but it is beneath the dignity of the professeur de lycée on de 
collége. The prejudice has led to the failure of some attempts to introduce lectures 
on education at university centers. There is now a distinct tendency in the opposite 
direction. Some of those in high places, like M. Compayré, the rector of the Acad- 
emy of Portiers, are known to be advocates of a science of education and the 
university courses that have been started, though attendance at them is compulsory 
upon none, have justified their existence by the considerable auditory they have 
attracted. It seems likely that the French love of organization will set to work 
here too, and that before long it may be true, not only of picked teachers, but of the 
professor as a whole, that they are ‘thoroughly trained and tested.”

  § 1. It is important to observe at the outset that while each of the German States 
is independent of the rest for the purposes of public instruction, practical consider- 
ations make it necessary that the smaller States should follow the Iecad of the latter 
in some important particulars; thus the recent reform in the training of secondary 
teachers originated by Prussia* has been at once copied .by some of the smaller 
States, because they can only enable their students to become eligible for posts in 
Prussian schools by giving to them a training which the Prussian ministry of public 
instruction will acceptas adequate. Further, the imposition of compulsory military 
servico has brought with it the law of exemption, which releases every boy who 
attains a certain standard® at a higher school from two out of the three years of 
service. This law prevails in every State, and therefore imposes a certain amount 
of uniformity in standards and in modes of inspection.4 
Thus, while the independence of the various States permits of a good deal of 
variety in method and practice, there are tendencies at work to produce uniformity, 
so that it is possible in general terms to describe “‘German” methods and to speak

of a “German system” of education, although deviations from the general plan may 
often present themselves. Further, this general system may be regarded as reaching 
over a wider area, beyond the German States themselves. Austria, Switzerland, 
Norway, Sweden, and Holland all present features closely allied to the kind of 
organization that we find in Germany proper. 
§ 2. The registration of the teacher involves the registration of the school; the 
State’s relation to the former is, in Germany, determined by its relation to the latter. 
If we classify secondary schools according to the nature of their government, we 
have, roughly speaking, three kinds: 
(a) Government schools, maintained and directed wholly by the ‘ministerium.”! 
These are very often old endowments, analogous to our English grammar schools. 
They are administered very much as a State department; the head master and his 
colleagues are appointed by the ministerium, and regard themselves in many respects 
as civil servants, 
(b) Municipal and guild schools, founded: or conducted by some local authority. 
These comprise most of the schools of a more modern type: Realschulen, technical 
schools, or high schools for girls—arising out of the local needs of the neighborhood. 
They are very often subsidized by the State as well as by local funds, and the sub- 
sidy, of course, carries with it the obligation to accept Government regulations; 
among others, those relating to the employment of certified teachers. 
(c) Private schools, the property of a private individual (the type of school sup- 
ported by a commercial company, so common in England, is never met with abroad). 
It is sometimes supposed that private school education is unknown in Germany, 
but thisis an crror. There always have been a large number of institutions, both 
boarding and day schools, in private hands, and it is held, by educational reformers 
as well as by State officials, that their existence, under proper supervision, is a 
benefit and not an evil. 
§ 3. The principle upon which the Kultusministerium in German States relies, in 
controlling schools which it does not actually administer—(i. e., schools in classes b 
and c—is to give a valuable official recognition to institutions conducted accord- 
ing to rules and methods of which it approves, and to refuse this recognition to 
such institutions and teachers as choose to remain outside—a recognition so highly 
appreciated that it compels all good schools for boys to seek it, and no teacher ven- 
tures to embark upon his calling without reckoning with it. 
To facilitate this recognition, a well-understood standard of attainment is in vogue 
for the various classes in each type of school understood by parents and the public 
generally, as well as by teachers and officers. Just as in England we understand 
what is meant by a boy being in the sixth form of a good public school, so in Ger- 
many the first class, second class, etc., represent fixed standards of attainment, to 
which all schools must conform, if they seek public recognition, and the ministerium 
holds itself responsible for seeing that these standards are maintained. 
Two questions arise: (1) How does the ministerium satisfy itself as to the main- 
tenance of those standards? (2) What is the nature of the public recognition—the 
inducement offered as a reward to the school for maintaining it? 
§ 4, The ministerium lays down rules, similar to those with which we are familiar 
in England in the case of primary education, relating to the warmth and ventilation 
of schoolrooms, the limits to the numbers permitted to be taught by a teacher, and 
(what mainly concerns us here) the requirement that the classes shall be taught 
throughout the day by teachers recognized by the ministerium as qualified to give 
the instruction, and paid a salary on a par with that paid for similar service in Gov- 
ernment schools? (Class a above). And the instruction given by teachers must be 
heard by inspectors from time to time.   
1Every State has a department of public instruction, usually associated with that of public wor- 
ship. See Stat. Jahrb., I. VII-XVIII. IT, 2, 242, ete. For each province of Prussia there is also a 
“Schul-Kollegium.”’ 
2Information as to salaries is found on pp. xxv, ete., in Stat. Jahrb., and elsewhere; pensions, 
ete., on p. 951.
-P-A-G-E-758
  700 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1894-95. 
Again, the time-table of the school must be submitted to the ministerium as evi- 
dence that the school is fulfilling the programme which its description imposes upon it. 
And, finally, the highest forms of all secondary boys’ schools are examined for the 
sake of awarding leaving certificates (Reifezeugnisse).!_ The examination is mainly 
conducted by the staf, but an inspector supervises the work, both oral and written. 
§ 5. The recognition offered by the Government as an inducement arises from the 
value attached to these certificates; they are essential to the future progress of any 
boy who seeks employment in the civil, military, or naval services.2 The various 
branches of these services are filled not, as with us, by competitive examinations, 
but by selection out of candidates who have the proper ‘‘Berechtigung” from a school, 
showing that they have passed through their classes with credit. The example of 
the Government is followed largely not only by corporate bodies but by private 
employers of labor, for public opinion in Germany is only too prone to exaggerate 
the value of school instruction. 
Hence we may summarize the attitude of the State as follows: 
To the parent it says: ‘We do not positively forbid you to educate your children 
ill; you may, if you will, put him to a school of which we do not approve, and so 
long as he is not scandalously ill-taught we shall not actively interfere; but he will 
lose all the benefits that we attach to education of which we do approve, he will not 
escape threo years’ service in the army, he will not be admitted to a university or 
politechnikum, and he will not be eligible for Government employment.” 
To the intending teacher it says: ‘‘We do not compel you to scek our certificates 
or to undergo the prescribed course of professional training, but if you remain uncer- 
tificated you will only be able to teach children whose parents renounce the advan- 
tages which we offer. You will be able to teach neither in a Government school nor 
in any municipal or private school which works under our recognition; almost your 
only chance of employment will be as a private tutor or in conducting a school for 
the children of foreigners.” 
§ 6. Two observations will here be in place. 
Opinion in Germany is unanimous as to the advantage which the country has 
secured from this method of control; indeed, a German can scarcely understand how 
any other country should be without it; but there are not a few protests from edu- 
cational reformers against the uniformity with which the ministerium in most of the 
States (and, above all, in Prussia) imposes ils views about instruction upon teachers 
so as to prevent progress in pedagogic research. Naturally enough the State official 
is inclined to regard the existing state of affairs as satisfactory; the reformer, on the 
other hand, considers every branch of school work as open to revision, and deplores 
the fetters by which the teacher’s initiative is restrained; the teacher, as a trained 
professional man, ought to be trusted within somewhat wide limits. I think there is 
sufficient evidence in favor of the reformer’s opinion; it is certainly true that the 
present generation has seen no pioneers of educational thought working out their 
ideas and ideals into practice. ‘The band of teachers who were inspired first by 
Roussean’s “Emile,” and then by Pestalozzi, seem to have few successors. Froebel 
was the last of them; and the education departments of the German States have done 
their best to drive the kindergarten out of Germany. The rigidity of school law has 
made independent research almost an impossibility, and yet the progress of pedagogy 
scems to be as dependent as other sciences upon practical experiment; there is a 
great expenditure of energy in thinking and in writing upon the whole field of 
teaching, but little progress is made, except within the circle where the teacher is 
permitted a free hand. True, this circle is wider than that within which the edu-

3 Tho only centers where freedom in research can be properly conducted are the one or two univer- 
sities where practicing schools are maintained independent of State supervision. The leaders in this 
movement are all Herbartians; hence the line of educational reform in Germany has followed the 
lead of Herbart and Ziller. :

cation code! allows the primary teacher to move, or than that within which tradition 
and the authority of the universities have bound our secondary schools; neverthe- 
less, the teachers of Germany are justified in their complaint that important sections 
of their professional work are excluded from investigation by the deadening weight 
of State administration. 
§ 7. Secondly, it should be noted in passing that tho entire system of school 
inspection, involving the maintenance of uniform standards throughout the whole 
country, is conducted without introducing the evils of simultaneous written examin- 
ations, which in England have done so much to destroy the efficiency of teaching, 
but which we find it so difficult to dispense with. The system, especially that part 
of it which deals with exemption from military service, does bring with it some of 
the evils of overpressure and of ‘‘cram”; but the German schools are not troubled 
by the requirements of elaborate examination regulations leading up to papers of 
questions set by external authorities, who have no knowledge either of the teacher 
or of the school. Indeed, until a boy comes to his last year of school life he does 
not come directly under the eye of external authorities at all; the direktor and 
lehrercollegium of his school, subject to the occasional inspection from the minis- 
terium, are trusted to carry out their work ina professional spirit. Anything like 
serious inefficiency or breach of trust is readily exposed in a school community, which 
has closo relations not only to Government, but to a multitude of families jealously 
anxious for their children’s intellectual progress. I make this observation because I 
believe it to be possible in this country also to introduce efficient control over our 
secondary schools, without burdening either pupils or teachers with new schemes of 
simultaneous examinations. 
§ 8. Teachers’ certificates.—The requirements described above (that every class 
m a recognized school shall be taught in every branch by a teacher certified as com- 
petent for the perpose) imposes upon the ministerium the duties of registration, and 
for this purpose every German State and each of the provinces of Prussia has its 
examination committee (Priifungs-Kommission),? consisting partly of professors, 
partly of State officials. This commission takes charge of the candidate from the 
time when he first presents himself until he has passed through his course of train- 
ing and is finally certified as ‘‘ Oberlehrer.” 
The regulations may be distributed under three heads: 
A. Course of general study, previous to entering upon professional work. Tho 
candidate’s papers must show— 
(1) That he has been educated in a first-grade school, * gymnasium, realgymnasium, 
or oberrealschule, from which he has passed with credit as a student in a German 
university. 
(2) That he has spent at least three years in study at one or more of the German 
universities. - 
Norre.—Most candidates spend four, many five years, before presenting them- 
selves for the test. Teachers are now petitioning to be permitted to spend part o¢ 
this time at foreign universities, for the sake of a wider general culture, as well as 
for the acquirement of modern languages. 
(3) That his studies have comprised— 
(a) Some special branch of scholarship in which he desires to be certified as com- 
petent to give the highest instruction, and one or two branches allied to this. 
Every teacher is certified not only as generally competent but as especially qual- 
ified in certain branches. Thus one master on a staff may be certified to teach Latin 
and Greek up to the highest classes, and French up to tertia only; another, mathe- 
matics up to prima, and chemistry and physics up to tertia; both of them being also 
certificated as ‘form masters” (Klassenlehrer), since they are compelled to qualify 
also in the branches mentioned in the next paragraph.

  702 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
(b) Religion, philosophy (ethics and psychology), education, ' history, and litera- 
ture of the Fatherland. 
These branches are not imposed as part of the candidate’s general education, but 
as apart of his professional training. The general education? of the teacher is 
concluded when he leaves the gymnasium and enters the university, precisely as is 
the case with the student of medicine or of law. We may note, therefore, the 
special reasons which lead the ministerium to impose these selected studies upon 
all candidates. 
Religion is required, owing to the special relations in which the state stands to the 
church. The kultus ministerium is at the same time the ministry of public worship 
in most of the States. The examination is always of a serious character, and involves 
laborious preparation. 
Philosophy and education, unless offered by the candidate as a special study, are 
tested more generally. The candidate is expected to understand the elements of 
ethics and psychology as a foundation for the studies in education which he will pur- 
sue in greater detail presently. He is expected to have used his opportunities to 
hear university lectures on piidagogik, especially in its philosophical and historical 
aspects. Courses of this character have been given almost everywhere by professors 
of philosophy since the days of Kant and Wolff. If the candidate shows a special 
interest in the subject, it will in some States be to his advantage; in others it will 
not, for many influential men distrust the theoretical presentment of educational 
doctrine by professors who live apart from the school. <A candidate, however, who 
had wholly neglected the subject would be in danger of rejection, and he would 
never satisfy the commission if he proved to be unacquainted with philosophy. 
The history, geography, and literatureof Germany are required of all candidates 
for a reason analogous to that which requires religion ; the foundations of patriot- 
ism and civie duty are to be laid in an accurate knowledge of the history and the 
thoughts of the German people. 
The candidate has already shown a knowledge of this subject, as well as of gen- 
eral history, ancient and modern, in the leaving certificate which he has brought 
from the gymnasium, but this is not considered sufficient for the teacher without a 
more detailed study of the nation’s fortunes. 
Here concludes the course of professional study which the candidate must under- 
take before he presents himself to the commission. * 
B. With certificates showing that the candidate has passed through this course of 
study, he presents himself for the ‘“‘Staatsexamen,” which is conducted by members 
of the commission, or, in part, by professors whom they may nominate for the pur- 
pose. The examination is partly oral, partly it consists of theses written by the can- 
didate to show that he has done some independent thinking on the lines of his special 
studies ; very usually a candidate will also be given a subject on which he will be 
bidden to produce an essay within forty-eight hours, giving his word of honor that 
he has written it without assistance except from books. Itshould be noted that some 
of the examiners are already acquainted with the candidate before he presents him- 
self for the Staatsexamen. The professors on the Priifungs Kommission are teachers 
in the university where the candidate has pursued most of his studies; he has 
attended their seminary, and they have advised him and watched his progress. 
Finally, this Staatsexamen takes no account of the university degree. Teachers 
are placed on exactly the same footing as clergymen, medical men, or lawyers—each 
must pass his Staatsexamen before being permitted to practice. If they choose, they 
can also present themselves before the philosophical faculty of any university in 
Germany for the doctor’s degree, and teachers usually do so, for the examination is 
  
_ 1 Piidagogik. 
/) 2So far as the State regulates it. It is, of course, recognized that the university student is gaining 
general culture as well as technical training during his university career. 
80On sending in his name as a candidate he must forward the whole set of certificates to the office of 
the Priifungs Kommission.

not so severe as the Staatsexamen and covers similar ground. If an Oberlehrer is 
found without the title, the omission is due to poverty, for the expenses in fees are 
considerable; while, however, the title is sought for the sake of social and academic 
distinction, it is ignored by the law; the universities are not authorized to con- 
fer benefits beyond those that properly fall within their province as an academic 
society. 
C. Having passed this examination, the student is admitted to a course of train- 
ing as a “ Schulamts Kandidat.” 
§9. The teachers’ training.—Hitherto the student has not been compelled by law to 
interest himself very seriously! in education; his main attention has been devoted to 
“liberal” studies—classies, mathematics, or modern languages, as the case may be. 
But it is important to notice that students who take a special interest in Piidagogilk 
have opportunities for pursuing their inquiries during their university career. The 
liberty allowed to the German undergraduate of keeping terms in any German univer- 
sity enables such men to go to Halle, or Leipzig, or Giessen, or Jena, in each of 
which universities elaborate arrangements are made for “practical” training in 
school classes, associated with courses of university lectures. There are professors 
of pedagogy in theso universities who have charge of a school, or of classes in a 
school, where students can teach under supervision. At Leipzig and at Giessen the 
professor is also head master of a large gymnasium;? at Jena he is given charge of a 
small practicing school conducted by his assistants solely for the purposes of peda- 
gogy, while at Halle a so-called Piidagogium has been in existence since 1700 as a 
part of the great Franckesche endowment. In other universities a professor of 
philosophy will frequently give a course of lectures on piidagikog, and may also con- 
duct a “theoretical” seminar® for the study of the subject by means of papers and 
discussions, but in these four universities a “practical” seminar is arranged, of 
which criticism lessons form a part, and in which the whole range of school work is 
brought under review. 
These ‘‘ practical ” university seminars have played an important part in the 
development of higher training. Firstly, they have maintained the close associa- 
tion between pedagogy and philosophy. Training readily tends to be reduced to a 
system of rules-of-thumb, put together from the limited experience by busy school- 
masters, and to neglect the wider and more permanent issues to which a right pre- 
sentment of education must always appeal. Now, in a German university both 
professor and student are free to contemplate the field at leisure, with less regard to 
the exigencies of the moment, independent of Government codes or State inspectors. 
It was in such a seminar that Herbart, when he succeeded to the chair of Kant at 
Kénigsberg,‘ gathered round him the ond of students who have developed his ideas 
into the science of education as it is understood in Germany to-day. 
Secondly, they have been pioneers, working out by experiment the problem with 
which we are here concerned, as to how young men may best be trained for the 
work of higher teaching; they have attracted the promising undergraduates 
who in later life have become either distinguished head masters, directing gym- 
nasial § seminars or have served as directors of primary training colleges. 
Now many university professors are of opinion that the whole business of higher

3 Note on the term “ seminar.” —The word is used in two senses, which have to be kept distinct. 
J. Ina university a seminar is a weekly meeting such as all professors conduct with their best 
students to stimulate discussion and independent investigation. 
2. The term is also used to describe training colleges for teachers, whether day or boarding. 
‘Thus: Lehrerseminar = Primary training college. 
Gymnasialseminar = Training college for secondary schoelmasters connected with a gymnasium. 
A wraining course conducted by a university professor of pedagogy (in pidagogisches Universitiits- 
Seminar) partakes of both characters. 
_ 41809-1833. 
5 See below, § 12.
-P-A-G-E-762
  104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
training ought to be conducted on this model: Establishing chairs of pedagogy, 
with practicing schools attached, in every university. Other professions—medicine 
and law—look to the university for practical as well as theoretical training; why 
should it not also serve for the teaching profession® Their argument is strengthened 
by the development of university activity which recent years have witnessed; not 
only are medical and dental students provided with “practical” seminars, associated 
with hospitals and ‘‘cliniks,” but natural science students and students of agricul- 
ture have now their laboratories, all directed by professors in “practical” seminars. 
On the other hand, the prevailing opinion among head masters is that the “practi- 
cal” side of training can only be imperfectly undertaken by a university department, 
and that the detailed study of school practice should be delayed until the student 
has closed his university carecr. The question can not be regarded as finally set- 
tled, but for the present the action of Prussia in 1890! has opposed the professorial 
view; the work done in the four universities will no doubt develop and is likely to 
be imitated elsewhere, but in the eyes of school law it will continue to be regarded 
as affording opportunities to the best men rather than as a plan on which the mass 
of teachers are to receive training. In what respects, then, is higher training a 
matter of compulsion and not of choice? 
§ 10. The legal requirements relating to training: 
I. The Probejahr.—For more than fifty years every intending teacher, after passing 
his Staatsexamen, has been sent to a gymnasium or other secondary school for a 
trial year, called the Probejahr.? He is not paid any salary, but is attached to the 
staff, teaching for a few hours every week and learning what he can from the head 
master and his colleagues. During the year he produces a few pedagogic theses and 
is expected to acquaint himself with the work of the various classes of the school, and 
particularly with those branches of instruction in which he is certified as a scholar.* 
At the close of the year a report upon his progress is submitted to the Prufungs- 
Kommission by the head master in conjunction with the staff (Lehrerkollegium), and 
he is then certified as ‘‘ Oberlehrer.” 
This year of trial has been more or less useful according to circumstances. Under 
a headmaster of ability, ready to take an interest in training, the Probejahr might 
be of the greatest benefit; but very often the Probekandidat has learned little more 
than if he had been put to full work with full pay. True, he has had the benefit of 
looking round upon every department of school work, and the head master has the 
responsibility of giving him hints and of putting him into the ways of tho place, 
but very little has come of the plan, and dissatisfaction, with its results, has always 
been felt. It has had, however, one great advantage: If a young man is a hopeless 
failure the head master and staff refuse to recommend him at the year’s end, to the 
mutual advantage both of the candidate and of the schools. 
This Probejahr may then be regarded as the first step in the development of an 
efficient system of training on the ‘‘practical” side, and it represents the low-water 
mark of achievement in the German States. Several of the German States have for 
many years made better provision. Thus, in Hessen and in the Kingdom of Saxony, 
where there exist universities‘ above alluded to, with a chair of pedagogy and a 
‘‘practical” seminar, the ministerium has compelled students to join this seminar for 
one or more terms, cither before or after passing the Staatsexamen. 
§ 11. The Royal Pedagogic Seminary in Prussia. 
II. In Prussia another method has been adopted which has provided training for 
about seventy students. Twelve institutions, called Kénigliche Piidagogische Semi- 
nare,® have been founded with scholarships (stipendia) to assist students who attend

them. Most of them were established or reorganized about 1880, when the fecling of 
dissatisfaction with the Probejahr began to be widely felt. These seminars consistof 
a director and from five to ten students, who practice in one or more secondary schools 
in the neighborhood; in several cases the Direktor is also head of a gymnasium. Tho 
feature to be noted about these seminars is that they are wholly unconnected with a 
university, although several of them are in university towns; two or three of them 
are open only to classical men; one, in Berlin, is confined to modern-language 
teachers.! = 
Thus, about 20 per cent of the best candidates offering in Prussia have been pro- 
vided for, and elsewhere in Germany a few similar seminars may be found; but in 
no case have they supplied the wants of all candidates, and the Probejahr, up to 
within the last three years, has been the simplest mode of fulfilling Government 
requirements with respect to training. : 
§ 12. III. The new Gymnasial Seminar in Prussia.—The importance of the reform 
of 18902 lies in the fact that it compels all candidates to take a year of real training 
in a properly organized seminar, and this in addition to and before the Probejahr. 
The Kultus ministerium of Prussia would, it seems, have adopted this compulsory 
rule long before if it had seen its way to organizo the training for all its candidates. 
It determined finally to extend the method already adopted in the Royal Pedagogie 
Seminary and to disregard the claims of the universities to share in training. An 
invitation was given to some forty of the ablest head masters to establish small semi- 
nars in connection with the staff of their schools. A small increase of salary was 
~ assigned to the head master and to those of his assistants who joined him in the care 
of these young men. 
The Prussian candidates are now distributed in classes of from 4 to 10 students 
among some 50 to 60 seminars, the 12 of earlier endowment and the 40 set on foot 
in 1890. 
It is often asked, In what respect does this Seminarjahr, now imposed as an addi- 
tional year of training, differ from the Probejahr, since both are under the direction 
of head masters? The difference lies in the elaborate regulations made by the min- 
isterium to insure that the training is effective, and in the provision of proper time? 
and proper remuneration to those who assist in it. According to the official regula- 
tions, the head master and his staff are responsible for the following: — 
(1) A complete course of study and reading, with informal lectures and discus- 
sions on pedagogic principles in their application to secondary schools, particularly 
dealing with those branches in which the candidates are specially qualified to teach; 
school administration and school hygiene not to be lost sight of; importance to be 
attached to recent pedagogic literature. 
(2) Associated with this study there must be systematic practice in teaching, 
going from the bottom of the school to the top, with weekly discussions presided 
over by the Direktor. 
(3) The candidates to have the same status as the permanent staff, and to attend 
its weekly meeting,‘ to join in all assemblies and other school functions, games, 
festivals, school tours, and the like. 
(4) Toward the close of the year the candidates are to write essays on subjects 
assigned by the director, who finally sends to the ministerium a full report of the 
year’s work. Thereupon the ministerium will appoint each candidate, either to the 
same or to some other school for a probejahr. 
In the eyes of head masters the great merit of this plan is that they are training 
assistants after their own style; it is the advantage of the apprentice system as 
1]. am told that these royal seminars have taken little interest in pedagogy; their work has been 
mainly in classical or modern philological studies. 
2Stat. Jahrb.,-XXI, XXII. 
2It is said, however, that in many of these new gymnasial seminars neither the time nor the 
remuneration are adequate to a right performance of these new duties.

contrasted with the technical institute. Every school has its own way of doing 
things, and a good staff will be willing to take trouble with candidates, in the hope 
of filling vacancies as they occur with the best of them. A better argument in 
favor of this gymnasial seminar as opposed to a university seminar is that it brings 
the student into daily contact with children. There.isa great temptation to theorize 
upon educational topics, and the speculative character of university studies encour- 
ages the tendency. The best corrective to it is to be placed much among children 
and to be trained to observe them in daily intercourse. This personal interest in 
boys seems very difficult to young men while they are still engaged in university 
studies, and yet they can not safely pursue pedagogy in the absence of it. 
§ 13. IV. The combination of methods employed in Saxe-Weimar.—The Duchy of 
Saxe-Weimar is one of the smaller States which have followed the lead of Prussia, 
compelled by the practical difficulty alluded to in section 1. It has established a 
gymnasial seminar in connection with the gymnasium at Jena, but it has also aimed 
to supply the defects of this method by associating the training of its students with 
the chair of pedagogy in the university.1 Every Schulamts-Kandidat in Saxe- 
Weimar is compelled to spend his seminarjahr at Jena, which has for many years 
becn a chief center of pedagogic study, and is at present the only university which 
grants funds to conduct a practicing school. Now, the weakness of the Prussian 
gymnasial seminar lies in the fact that it is conducted by a head master and staff 
who have left their speculative studies behind them and are likely to ignore the 
scientific aspects of education and to depreciate the value of research. The Weimar 
ministerium has therefore sought to avoid this danger, and from elose personal 
observation I am enabled to form a high opinion of the result. By working in the 
gymnasium the students become familiar with the specific character of gymnasial 
teaching, but at the same time they are following tho training of the university 
seminar, where they mix with teachers of many types, foreign as well as German, 
and take their share in prosecuting inquiries and experiments, Thus the narrowing 
ten¢ency of the gymnasial seminar is corrected by the free and critical spirit pre- 
vailing in the university seminar, and the tendency to undue academic speculation 
in the latter is balanced by the daily routine among teachers of experience in the 
gymnasium. 
Norr.—An objection is often raised to the training of teachers by giving them 
practice in school classes, that the teaching* suffers too seriously; parents, it is 
said, do not send their boys to school to be practiced upon by novices. It isnot my 
place to argue the question here; but I may point out that the danger is minimized 
in these gymnasial seminars by limiting the number of students. Ten is the maxi- 
mum allowed by the law. Now, 10 students teaching only for ten hours a week 
each, in a school of 300 to 400 boys, will not seriously injure the instruction, even if 
it be granted that these criticism lessons do prove to be injurious. The benefit of 
the plan to the staff is undoubted. Hofrath Richter, the head master of the Jena 
Gymnasium, reports as follows in his Jahresbericht for 1891-92: ‘‘The boys have 
quickly become accustomed to the presence of a few students in the classroom, and, 
indeed, we observe a stimulus to their attention and interest when I myself or one 
or two of my colleagues are also present. And the seminar has certainly had a bene- 
ficial effect upon the work of the staff; the masters have the strongest inducement, 
both to prepare their lesson notes with care and to impart their instruction 
effectively, since they are to be heard by the seminar students.” 
§ 14. The following will, perhaps, summarize the results of German experience in 
training up to the present: 
(a) There are two organizations to which the charge of training secondary teach- 
1 Now filled by Professor Rein, the leader of the Herbartian School. The Herbartians have been 
the main supporters of practical training in the university, as opposed to the merely speculative and 
theoretical treatment of pedagogy by professors of philosophy or theology, apart from practical 
work. (Seo page 704.) 
2'Phe progress of the boys. 
 
-P-A-G-E-765
REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION.’ 707 
ers should be intrusted—the university and the best schools. Neither of these can 
do the whole work alone. If the university attempts training, its professor should 
have some kind of a practicing school; if a secondary school establishes a training 
department, if must see to it that theory, based upon philosophy, is provided 
beforehand or side by side with the training. 
(b) Comprehensively considered, training covers the whole period of study from 
the time when the intending teacher leaves school. But the first portion of this 
period of study (for a degree, or the like) should be conducted, if possible, apart 
from professional training proper, and, for secondary teachers, should undoubtedly 
be undertaken at the university. 
(c) Training can not be accomplished by a course of private reading followed by 
an examination; a teacher’s certificate is only of value when it shows that the 
student has been instructed in the science and art of teaching. The certificates of 
responsible instructors, professors, or head masters, showing that the student has 
done every part of his training under their oversight, should be an indispensable 
requirement before registration; an examination, oral or written, can only be 
regarded as supplementary. 
(d) While a comparatively easy gate may be left open for the registration of the 
ordinary teacher, it is essential to progress that opportunities for advanced training 
and for the best quality of work be afforded in universities, which should be the 
appropriate centers for research, in pedagogy as in other fields of professional study. 
§ 15. The above account has dealt with the ordinary secondary schoolmaster 
(Oberlehrer), but two other classes of teachers are employed in secondary schools: 
(a!) Primary teachers (Volkschullehrer), who have been trained in primary train- 
ing colleges, and who can qualify to teach the lower forms of a gymnasium, or to 
teach certain branches, by passing an appropriate examination. In the gymnasien 
and realschulen about 20 per cent of the whole staff are perhaps drawn from the 
ranks of the primary teachers; in the third grade schools (Héhere Biirgerschulen) 
more than half. a 
The Oberlehrer is always a university man, the Volkschullehrer is not and can not 
be, but he has very often received a better pedagogic training,? and he is placed on 
a full level of equality with the rest of a gymnasial staff, if he takes a postina 
gymnasium instead of remaining in primary work. I do not intend to deal further 
with the training of these teachers, because this would fall more properly under an 
account of primary education. 
(b) Teachers of special branches, such as drawing and music (Fachlehrer or 
Technische Lehrer),* not regarded as a part of the staff (Lehrer-Kollegium), but 
certified as belonging to their own profession, as teachers of music or arf teachers. 
These must be certified, like the rest, by the authority of the ministerium, not only 
as artists, but as competent teachers of their art; their training is regulated by rules 
applicable to their profession; they must have studied at a conservatorium or @ 
gewerbeschule, ‘ or the like. 
$16. It remains to be pointed out that the States of Germany, in undertaking the 
control of teachers’ training, have done nothing to provide that the teacher, when 
trained, shall find employment. The same is true, of course, in other professions. 
In England we meet with many educated men who can not find employment, but in 
Germany there are far more to be found, and they have not only been highly educated, 
but have been severely trained. Many Oberlehrer, unable to find a post in a second- 
ary school, -have in recent years been admitted as teachers in primary schools; not 
a few have emigrated; finally, the ministerium in Prussia® and in other States have

made an effort to discourage young men from coming forward as candidates, in 
order to reduce the supply to a level with the annual number of vacant posts. The 
question is, in fact, being raised in Germany whether the public authority; which 
registers teachers by compelling them to a prolonged course of training, should not 
Jook forward to their future, and recognize some sort of obligation to find employ- 
ment forthem. Definite action by means of a school lawis difficult, and to raise the 
standard of attainment unduly is unjust,’ because it injures the candidates by 
excessive strain; but the excessive competition of an overcrowded profession is 
equally injurious, and in the schools it produces evils from which both teacher and 
child have to suffer. The evils are perhapsnot so apparent in Germany as in England, 
because of the control of higher education; but this cause has not suppressed the 
mischief, although it has modified the form of it. 
§17. The training of women teachers and of teachers in special schools. 
The influence of women upon German education is very small, and men teachers 
continue to shut them out from the more important posts in girls’ high schools. 
Some who in theory believe in the value of women as teachers consider that it 
is unwise to encourage them at present in Germany, so long as a large number of 
trained men are without employment. Hence the principalship and the best-paid 
posts in girls’ schouls are occupied by men,? although many instances may be found 
where lady principals are permitted, especially in semiprivate schools, which are 
subsidized very often by town councils. 
A woman in Germany can not aspire to the highest rank in any profession, for the 
university is the only gate to the professions, and she is almost universally excluded 
from university studies; hence her only path to a teacher’s certificate lies in seeking 
training in a primary training college for women teachers (Lehrerinnen seminar). 
After this course women students usually spend some years in England and France, if 
they aspire to teach in high schools. The only other method of training is to gain 
admittance to one of the seminars which in a few cases have been attached to girls’ 
high schools of reputation on the plan of the gymnasial seminar. 
Finally, it should be added that all kinds of special schools—for the blind, for the 
deaf and dumb*—as well as commercial and technical institutions,‘ come under the 
inspection of the ministerium, and hence the teachers of these institutions are 
required to be equipped with appropriate qualifications. Thus the endeavor is 
made to extend the benefit of public oversight to every branch of education.

MEMORANDUM BY MR. M. E. SADLER ON THE LEAVING EXAMINATION AS 
CONDUCTED IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA.® 
As reference is frequently made in the course of this report to the German 
Abiturienten-Examen, a short account of the way in which it is actually conducted 
may be of service to those who are unacquainted with the details of the system. 
For the particulars I am indebted to Dr. Emil Hausknecht, of Berlin, a teacher 
with wide knowledge of German secondary schools. 
For each type of secondary school in Prussia a general plan of studies is laid down 
by the State, But the lines of this general plan are so wide as to give to the head 
master of each school considerable freedom in framing its curriculum, In this task 
he naturally takes counsel with the teachers on his staff. When the head master has 
thus, with the aid of his assistants, planned the curriculum of his school in full

detail, his scheme has to be submitted to the “college” of inspectors for their 
approval, Every three years the plan of studies must be reviewed by the head 
master and again sent in for the approval of the college of inspectcrs as before. If 
in thus revising his curriculum the head master proposes any considerable altera- 
tions he must state at length his reasons for doing so. He is also permitted to 
append to his own statement a supplementary report on the points in question pre- 
pared by ono of tho teachers on his staff. Three written copies of this detailed plan 
of studies are preserved, one being in the possession of the head master, another in 
the hands of the inspector, and the third being kept for reference on the part of any 
assistant teacher in the school. 
There lies on the desk of each class room in the school a log book, in which the 
teacher, before leaving the room at the end of a lesson, enters a brief record of the 
work done in the course of it. This log book or diary is always accessible to the head 
master and to the inspector, for whose guidance a complete picture of the course of 
instruction given in the class is thus preserved. The head master and the inspector, 
by tho aid of this diary, are enabled to check the teacher’s methods and to assure 
themselves that he adheres to the course of instruction prescribed in the detailed 
curriculum, 
Moreover, the more important exercises of the pupils, and especially the “unseens,” 
are written, not on loose sheets of paper, but in notebooks, in which corrections 
and criticisms are also written by the teacher. ‘The cxercises and the corrections are 
both dated, and the notebooks containing them are carefully preserved for reference 
for ono year, or, in the caso of the highest class, for two years. Each pupil has a 
separate notebook for cach subject. 
The log book and the exercise books together thus provide a continuous record 
of the work done by each class. They are regularly examined by the head master, 
and also by the inspector when the latter visits the school. ‘This he does without 
notice and at his pleasure, and almost always within the two or three months imme- 
diately preceding the leaving examination. The less efficient schools are more fre- - 
quently inspected. The inspectors, it should be added, are invariably men who 
have had previous experience as teachers. They are usually appointed when about 
or a little moro than 40 years of age. There are no women inspectors. To each 
inspector a group of specified schools is assigned for a short term of years. When 
the inspector visits a school he examines the log books and the exercise books and 
listens to the teaching given in the classes. He is also permitted to put questions 
to the pupils, and very often does so. 
At the end of each school year there is a ‘‘promotion examination” in every class 
below the highest. The written part of this promotion examination is conducted 
by the teachers alone, but the oral part is held in the presence of the head master, 
who may also himself question the scholars, As a matter of fact, only those boys 
are examined orally whose marks (either in the written examination or in the gen- 
eral report on the year’s work) are unsatisfactory. The report on the year’s work of 
each boy has to be sent into the head master before the written examination begins. 
It is drawn up in simple symbols; + signifying ‘‘ripe,” O “not ripe,” and ? ‘‘doubt- 
ful.” No great importance is attached to the promotion examination, and boys are 
sometimes promoted even though they have done badly in it. Promotion from class 
to class is not determined mechanically by the scale of marks obtained in the pro- 
motion examination, but depends on the general character of the pupil’s work during 
the year. 
The leaving examination is confined to boys in the first class. Under ordinary 
circumstances about 25 boys will enter for it in cach school, Three months 
before the examination begins each boy prepares a biographical sketch, in which he 
shortly reports on his previous education from its commencement to the date of the 
composition. He is allowed to specify the subjects of which he is particularly fond 
(including any subject not taught in schools) and those which he had special diffi- 
culty in studying. Two months before the examination each master sends to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-768
710 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
head master a paper of questions or problems in the subjects on which he has given 
instruction. This paper contains three times as many questions as will be required 
in the leaving examination. The head master examines the questions and either 
approves them as they stand or revises them after consultation with the teacher 
concerned. These sets of questions are then sent to the inspector, together with a 
long characterization of each pupil, written by the class master and agreed to by all 
the masters engaged in teaching the boy, as well as by the head master. This report 
on the character of the pupil’s work is long and full, being written, partly in sym- 
bols and partly in words, on printed schedules. At the same time, also, cach master 
has to report of each individual pupil whether he thinks him ripe to pass the exam- 
ination. On this point the opinion of the master, on which much depends, is expressed 
in the words ‘‘yes,” ‘‘no,” or “doubtful.” His decision, which is based on the boy’s 
work during the year, weighs as much as the written and oral examinations which 
follow put together. Each boy must have reached in his year’s work a certain 
standard in cight or nine subjects, but special success in a “ eompensatory subject” 
contervails failure in one other, German excepted. : 
On receiving the papers of proposed questions and the reports on the individual 
pupils, the inspector carefully examines them, and may refer the questions in any sub- 
jeet with which he is not himself familiar to one of his colleagues in the “college” 
of inspectors to which he belongs. Each “college” will naturally have among its 
members an expert in each branch of the school curriculum, but different parts of the 
same school are not assigned to different inspectors. On the contrary, each of the 
schools is placed, as a whole, under the care of one inspector only for a term of years. 
The teachers in a particular school may thus come to know in what subjects their 
inspector is weak, and this may have some effeet on the work of the school. It is 
said, however, that in practice the effect is small, care being taken not to assign a 
school in which the teaching of a particular subject is weak to an inspector whose 
knowledge of that subject happens also to be defective. 
When the inspector has perused the papers of questions and the reports, he fixes 
the date for the oral examination. The head master of the school then appoints a 
day for the written examination, usually choosing a date which will fall from four to 
five weeks before that fixed by the inspector for the oral examination. The day 
before the written examination the inspector sends back to the school the papers of 
questions, having marked on each paper one-third of the questions. The questions 
so marked are set in the examination. The papers of questions are sent to the head 
master by the inspector in sealed envelopes, each paper under a separate cover. The 
questions arenot printed. On the day of examination the head master is required to 
hand the envelope containing the questions, with the seal still unbroken, to the class 
master in the presence of the candidates. The envelope is then opened and the 
marked questions are dictated to the candidates, one or more of the latter being , 
asked to repeat them in order to prevent mistakes. From two to five hours are given 
for each paper, allowance being made for the time taken by the dictation of the 
questions. The master concerned fills in a certificate showing the exact time at 
which the seal was broken, when the dictation began and ended, and when the worked. 
papers were collected by him. Therearefive subjects in which written examinations 
are held, and the papers are set on consecutive days. Only one paper is given on 
each day. The dates of the written examination are sometimes so arranged that a 
Sunday falls in the middle of the examination. 
As themaster thus knows beforehand the whole list of questions from which those 
setin the examination will be taken, it may be asked whether he does not specially 
prepare his pupils to pass in those particular subjects. A strict code of professional 
honor condemns and prevents any such unfair preparation. It is said that an ordinary 
teacher would rather commit suicide than thus cram up his boys beforehand to pass 
in the questions set by himself. His spirit would revolt against the suggestion. At 
tho same time some teachers are occasionally suspected of the practice. In case of 
such suspicion arising, the inspector pays frequent visits to the class taught by the   
-P-A-G-E-769
pe ee REPORT ON SECONDARY EDUCATION: ‘T11 
‘suspected master, and closely examines the character of his daily work. He is also 
free to refuse any of the threo sets of questions prepared by the teacher, and to sub- 
stitute a paper set by himself. But the most effective check on dishonorable practice 
lies in the fact that any teacher suspected of violating the spirit of the examination 
is scouted by his colleagues and condemned by professional opinion. If detected in 
any such offense he is branded with disgrace and dismissed without a pension. 
» Each set of answers worked in the examination is looked over by tho master, who. 
marks each answer 1, 2, 3, or 4, (i. e., very good, good, sufficient, or insufficient). 
Papers receiving any one of tho three highést marks are allowed to ‘‘pass.” The 
master is required to set forth in writing the grounds of his decision in respect to 
each paper. Furthermore, all the teachers concerned with the class look at the 
papers of all the candidates, and at the biographical sketches prepared by them, in 
order to form an opinion about each boy. When all this is done the masters meet * 
and make collectively a short report as to the “ripeness” of the various candidates 
for passing the examination. In making this supplementary report they take into 
account both their own first decision and the boy’s work in the written examination. 
All the worked papers, together with this second report and the boys’ own bio- 
graphical sketches, are now sent to the inspector, who, the day before his visit for 
the viva voce examination, looks through representative parts of the candidates’ work. 
On the day of the viva voce examination the inspector first presides over a meeting 
of the examination board, which consists of those masters to whom the head master 
has intrusted the care of the highest form during the preceding year, together with 
the head master and the inspector, the presence of the latter being required to make 
the board technically complete. On the board each man has one vote, the inspector 
having also a casting vote on any subject on which the opinion of the board happens 
to be equally divided. 
At this meeting of the examination board the inspector first makes general com- 
ments and criticisms on the work done in the class. Next he criticises the papers 
set for the examination, with special reference to their fitness to the particular 
school, and to their easiness and difficulty as compared with other papers set in cor- 
responding schools elsewhere. He then reviews the corrections made by the teachers 
on the boys’ worked papers. Of these corrections the inspector either states his 
approval or suggests alterations in them. Next he turns to the marks of each can- 
didate and goes carefully through the record of his work. fn case of any doubt 
he questions the teachers as to the boy’s work, or looks into his exercise books for 
the last two years, these books being required to be at hand during the meeting. 
Finally, he takes a vote on each boy. According to this voto the candidate is (1) 
either declared ‘‘ripe” without any further viva voce examination (which is equiv- 
alent to passing with honors); or (2) admitted to the viva voce examination, in 
which case he is so examined only in those subjects in which he has not been marked 
as “sufficient” both for his year’s work and in his written examination; or (3) 
excluded from the viva voce examination. A candidate so excluded is considered as 
having failed in the examination, and after three such failures a boy can not be 
admitted to the leaving examination again. 
As soon as it has been decided in tho meeting of the examining board which of the 
candidates are to be excused from the viva voce examination, which are to be admit- 
ted (and in what subjects), and which are to be excluded, all the candidates are 
assembled for prayers, and are afterwards introduced to the inspector by the head 
master. The inspector then announces the names of those who have passed the 
examination without having to undergo viva voce questioning, and, with a fow 
words of congratulation, excuses them from further attendance. He then tells the 
other candidates in what subjects they will be required to be examined viva voce, 
and the oral examination begins at once. 
A candidate who is admitted to this viva voce examination can ‘pull himself up” 
in any subject in which he has failed to obtain the mark “ sufficient” in the written 
examination. The master, however, may refuse to allow him thus to retrieve his eee at Pree) 2 7
-P-A-G-E-770
  712 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
‘failure. In case of such refusal, however, the candidate may ask to be examined 
‘viva voce in any subject in which ho has been marked 1 or 2 (i. c., “very good” or 
“gocd”), special success compensating for failure in any subject except German and 
religious knowledge. If a boy’s written examination work is marked higher than 
was his year’s work, he must be examined really in order to compensate for loss of 
marks in respect of his comparative failure in the course of instruction given dur- 
ing the year. If, on the other hand, a boy does badly in the year’s work, and passes 
in the written examination, but fails in viva voce he is regarded as having failed in 
the examination. g 
In order to lessen the number of papers, there is no written examination in some 
subjects—e. g., religious knowledge, history, and geography. Each boy’s viva voce 
examination in each subject generally lasts from twenty minutes to half an hour. 
Every candidate must pass in all subjects, except drawing, singing, and gymnastics. 
The inspector may, if he likes, examine a boy viva voce in religious knowledge, 
history, and geography; but in these subjects the master’s report on the candidate’s 
work during the year is generally decisive. The teaching of history in German 
schools is said to be good, though the results are rarely subjected to an external test 
in the leaving examination. As a matter of fact, however, boys in the highest class 
often find no small difficulty in obtaining from their teacher a satisfactory report in 
history and religious knowledge. 
The viva voce part of the leaving examination, including the meeting of the 
examining board which precedes it, usually lasts one day—e. g., from 8 a, m. to 6 or 
7p. m., with a short break for lunch. 
At the close of the examination day the examination board meets once more, the 
inspector being present. At this meeting all the other masters attend and may be 
asked questions by the inspector; but they have no vote or voice in the discussion. 
The results of the examination are announced at the end of the day, each candidate 
being simply told whether he has passed or failed. But the certificate which the 
candidate receives afterwards goes into very considerable detail. 
When held in schools which have a nine-years course the leaving examination 
admits the successful candidate to the university, except that in the case of the real- 
gymnasium and the ober-realschule it does not admit the student to academic study 
in classical philology, philosophy, theology, law, or medicine. When held in the 
real-schule, where the course is of six years’ duration, the leaving examination con- 
fers a certificate which admits the holder to many of the professions and to the civil 
service.~ 
It will be remembered that in his report on German schools, presented to the 
schools inquiry commission, Mr. Matthew Arnold thus summarized the rules of the 
leaving examination: “It is to be such as a scholar of fair ability and proper dili- 
gence may, at the end of his school course, come to with a quiet mind and without 
a painful preparatory effort, tending to relaxation and torpor as soon as the effort is 
over.” And he remarked on the care which is taken that “the instruction in the 
highest class should not degenerate into a preparation for the examination; that 
the pupil may have the requisite time to come steadily and without overhurrying to 
the fullness of the measure of his powers and character; and that he may be securely 
and thoroughly formed, instead of being bewildered and oppressed by a mass of 
information hastily heaped together.” 
The Prussian arbiturienten examen is interesting alike in respect of its methods 
and in the privileges which it confers, Its methods are carefully devised so as to 
give to the teacher a large degree of freedom in framing the curriculum of his 
school and in forming a fair judgment of his pupils’ abilities. But the whole 
examination depends on the fact that it is attached to an organized system of 
inspection. There seems, however, nothing to prevent this method of examination 
(with some modification) from being tried experimentally by one or other of our 
examining authorities,

GENERAL SUMMARY. 
The Kingdom, or rather Republic, of Poland ' (Rzeczpospolita Polska) 
disappeared from the commonwealth of nations, after an existence of 
eight hundred years, at the end of the last century. The dismember- 
ment of the Republic, which in the sixteenth century was the greatest. 
power of eastern Europe and had for centuries served as a bulwark 
1“ Poland,” says Lelewel, one of her greatest historians, ‘‘is a veritable and pure 
Republic, only invested with the forms of a constitutional monarchy.” The princi- 
pal character in the constitution of the Polish Government was a very decided separa- 
tion between the executive power intrusted to the King, and the legislative power, 
superior to the former and exercised by the nation, i. e., the representatives of those 
citizens who alone enjoyed political rights, the nobility and the clergy. These 
deputies, nuntii, about 200 before the partition, and the senators, elected by the 
King, could assemble either separately or combined, thus forming but one Chamber, 
the Diet (Seym), generalem omnium terrarum conventum,

against the destructive invasions into Europe of the Mongolian, Tar- 
tar, and Turkish hordes,! was accomplished by Russia, Austria, and 
Prusssia in three partitions (1772, 1793, 1795), The parts which once 
constituted the Republic of Poland are still integral parts of the three 
countries respectively. According to Morfill’s words, “Its limbs, 
although distorted, are still instinct with life;” its language is still 
spoken by upwards of ten millions; its literature is the oldest Slavonic 
literature next to Bohemian, and surpasses in importance and scope all 
the other Slavonic literatures taken together, i. e., Bohemian, Servian, 
Croatian, Slavonian, Russian, Bulgarian.? Its institutions and laws 
have perished, some of them fortunately for the broad masses of the 
Polish people who had nothing but the patrimony of the disinherited, 
serfdom. Austria at once introduced into Galicia the Austrian civil 
code; in the Prussian Polish provinces the Prussian Landrecht pre- 
vails. Russia alone permitted to the Kingdom (tsarstvo) of Poland a 
shadow of self-government and many privileges. Alexander I con- 
ferred great privileges upon the University of Wilno, confirmed the 
Lithuanian statutes in the western and southwestern governments and 
the code of Napoleon in Poland proper from the year 1807. But all 
this was changed into Russian law by a ukase of June 25, 1840. Yet 
in spite of the difficulties and restrictions under which the dismem- 
bered country labors, there are several very active centers of Polish 
literature, culture, and education, foremost among them Cracow and 
Lemberg, thoroughly Polish, excellent universities in Austrian Galicia. 
The work of the Academy of Cracow, founded in 1872, is of such a 
high standard of excellence, its editions of the Polish authors of the 
golden age (1541-1606) are so valuable, the many learned reviews that 
appear in Polish, equal to the best in other civilized countries, present 
so much original research and material that it is only a question of 
time when Polish literature and culture as well as that of the other 
Slavonic countries will constitute an essential part of instruction in 
our universities to supplement the Germanic and Romance languages 
and literatures. 
1% the reign of Boleslas V (1227-1279) the frightful Mongolian invasion took 
place (1241). Although gaining a Pyrrhus victery at the battle of Lignica (Lieg- 
nitz) in Silesia, they were diverted into Hungary after their force had been broken. 
Nothing since the battle on the Catalaunian fields can be compared with that car- 
nage. In the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, the Poles went forth 
the champions of Christendom and rolled back the tide of Moslem conquest from 
Europe. Justly, therefore, Melanchthon, speaking on this subject, says: ‘The 
magnanimity of this nation is especially displayed in their continual wars against 
the Tartars for the tranquillity of all Europe. For centuries she has protected 
Europe against the Tartars and the neighborhood of savage Asia. Let us never for- 
get these obligations to Poland, and let us recollect who are the people, and in what 
regions of the earth they were made instruments of Providence, and by protecting 
Europe, enabled her to preserve within her bosom humanity, religion, and those 
arts and sciences so beneficial to society.” 
2 According to Estreicher (Bibliographia Polonica, Cracow, 1870), it represents 
two-thirds of the entire Slavonic literature.
-P-A-G-E-773
HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. eS 
The University of Warsaw, although Russified to a great extent 
since the late insurrection, is still rich in national Polish spirit, learn- 
ing, and culture. The Polish press of Warsaw still turns out many 
valuable books, magazines, and reviews in all branches of literature 
and science, 
Prussia has best succeeded in Germanizing her Polish posses- 
sions, slowly eliminating or weakening the Polish element, “care- 
fully avoiding any of those reprisals which would cause a European 
scandal.” But “der neue Kurs,” under the enlightened young 
Emperor William II, has thoroughly reversed the old theory, if not 
the old practice. Coercion has been reduced to a minimum, yet the 
German language makes more rapid strides than ever and does not 
suffer under the fact that Polish is cultivated in family and school, 
especially in the religious education of the people, who are mostly 
Roman Catholics. It seems as if the idea had won ground in the 
highest authoritative circles of Prussia that a people with an almost 
equally old western civilization, abundantly rich literature, language, 
and history, can not be weaned and severed from it by persuasion, 
force or police measures. Thus, while the provinces of Posen, Upper 
Silesia, and old Prussia have a by far greater German population and 
more completely Germanized Slavs under the admirable Prussian 
school system, the educational influence of three years’ military train- 
ing,' and the general high standard of Prussia’s judiciary and admin- 
istrative institutions, yet the Polish language and literature are 
extensively cultivated among the people by the Catholic Church, in 
the public schools by Polish teachers during the limited time that is 
allotted to their language, and in the higher schools for their intrinsic 
value and because it is a fundamental necessity for understanding the 
historical origin and development of all the provinces between the Elbe, 
or at least the Oder, and the Vistula. Indeed, the colonization by the 
German clement of all that land is nothing but a protracted struggle, 
beginning as early as Charlemagne’s time and not finished yet by far, 
to subject, to absorb, or to annihilate the Slavonic, principally Polish, 
population that has expanded over the territory vacated by the Ger- 
man tribes during the first migrations of peoples. For Leopold von 
Ranke’s statement, “Es sind zwei Vélkerwanderungen, durch die der 
Umkreis der deutschen Gebiete aus dem inneren Germanien her 
bestimmt worden: dic eine war nach dem Westen, die andere nach dem 
Osten gerichtet,” is absolutely correct. But while the Germanic tribes 
had pushed themselves forward toward the west and south in power- 
ful streams and in a comparatively short period of time, the backward 
  
1T venture this statement, which may seem paradoxical to those who are wont to 
consider the German military service as a waste of time and energy, removing hun- 
dreds of thousands of men from temporary production. But any military instruttor 
who, like myself, has had an opportunity of observing many Polish recruits who 
come to the army as analphabets and leave it with a good equipment of German 
education, an enlarged horizon and excellent training, will surely agree with me.

  716 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
flood toward the east against the natural course of Slavonic immigra- 
tion occurred slowly, gradually, through many centuries, often inter- 
rupted by long pauses, historically not determined. While during the 
first migration Teutonic pagans pushed beyond the boundaries of Ger- 
mania, it was Catholic Christianity, the victorious Roman Church, the 
monks, who accompanied the progress of the Germans; later on it was 
the Reformation which led thousands and thousands toward the East. 
It is, of course, not to be forgotten that a second main incentive was 
the craving for material wealth and worldly power which made such 
invasions very bloody, cruel, and unjust, full of epic battles and adven- 
tures so graphically described in Mickiewic7’s Konrad Wallenrod, 
concerning the struggle between the Lithuanians and the Teutonic 
knights. 
There is no Polish university in these Prussian provinces it is true, 
but Posen and Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), Danzig and Thorn, even Breslau, 
the capital of Silesia, and all the Upper Silesian towns, not to speak 
of its mostly Polish villages, have still very strong Polish traits and 
traces. The concessions made to Polish education especially and Sla- 
vonic languages and literatures generally, the importance attributed 
to these branches in Prussia appear from the strong Slavonic depart- 
ments not only at the eastern universities of Breslau and K6énigsberg, 
but also at the University of Berlin. It is a very characteristic fact 
that for the first time, so far as I know, a scholar in Slavonic languages, 
the famous Wladyslaw Nehring, has become rector magnificus of the 
University of Breslau (1893-94). 
Prof. Karl Brugman, of Leipzic, in Die Deutschen Universitiiten, 
edited by W. Lexis, says in regard to Slavonic philology in Germany: 
“Slavonic philology, that bloomed up in the countries of the Austrian 
Crown and is about as old as Germanic and Romance philology, can 
naturally not have such a broad ground in Germany as its sister disci- 
plines. It has at present three full professorships, in Breslau, Leipsic, 
Berlin, occupied by Nehring, A. Leskien, whose principal merits lie in 
the domain of Slavonic grammar, and A. Briickner.! Besides the great 
successor of Miklosich (d. 1891), V. Jagié, who, besides an extraordinary 
many-sidedness in literary production, has done an exceedingly merito- 
rious work in grammar as well as in editing revised texts and investi- 
gating topics of literary history, was at the University of Berlin for 
several years (1874-1880). The latter is the founder of the Archiv fiir 
slay. Philologie (founded in 1875), the central organ of that science.” 
As for the important réle that the Slavonic element has been destined. 
to play in German life, it appears from the history and literature of 
Germany, which are quite permeated with its influence, German histo- 
rians never grow tired of showing the contrast of the two national 
characters; German poets and authors compare and contrast their 
      
In the research of the Baltic-Slavonic languages, the works of Leskien, A. Bez- 
zenberger (Gottingue, Kénigsberg), and A. Briickner (Berlin) are foremost.

traits and peculiarities, their ideals of education and culture. No one 
has done it better from a German point of view than Gustav Freytag, 
himself born on the frontier of Upper Silesia and Russian Poland, at 
Kreuzburg, in his Soll und Haben, and especially in his classical his- 
torical novels Die Ahnen and Bilder aus der deutschen Vergangenheit. 
PLAN AND ARRANGEMENT. 
It is my particular task to give a report on the higher education in 
the different parts of Poland, and with special reference to the shaping 
of the methods of instruction and organization on the part of the three 
Governments, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, with a view to assimilating 
the Slavonic population to the Government policies, social traditions, 
and civilization of the three nations respectively.’ 
For this undertaking it is necessary, first, to define more accurately 
the limits of the Kingdom of Poland at the time of her prosperity and 
of her decadence, while yet independent among the European nations; 
second, to give a sketch of the development of her educational facili- 
ties in the way of higher institutions of learning and universities during 
the period of her independence. Only from a comparison of her educa- 
tional conditions while independent can we ascertain and realize her 
progress or retrogression in higher education after her partition, the 
changes wrought for good or for evil, the assimilation to or reaction 
against foreign influences, the transmutation of political and social 
ideals, the participation of the different classes in an education which 
is partly not their own, inoculated with ideals conceived by her con- 
querors in order to bring her children to a gradual mental and intel- 
lectual as well as physical subjection. 
EXTENT OF POLAND, 
At the period of her greatest prosperity under the later Jagiellos, 
Sigismund I, Sigismund II Augustus (1507-1572), the short interreg- 
num and the brief nominal reign of Henry of Valois (1575), and the 
valiant Stephen Batory (1576-1586), Poland extended from the Baltic 
to the Black Sea, touching it at Akerman; from Bohemia, Moravia, 
Austria proper, Hungary, and the Danubian principalities to Russia 
beyond the Dnieper. The greatest length of the country from north 
to south was 713 English miles, and from east to west 693 miles. It 
embraced an area of about 282,000 English square miles, and this area 
in 1880 had a population of 24,000,000. 
For our investigation, however, which concerns Polish soil and

tion in Poland now in course of preparation, and to be published later through the 
regular channels of trade. The author begs to acknowledge assistance from Senator 
Michael Kruszka, of Milwaukee, on Galician secondary schools, and receipt of

Polish people proper, we must exclude all the country which was not 
Polish in spirit and nationality, though at certain times it belonged to 
the republic by conquest. Thus that part of Kijowska which lies 
beyond the Dnieper, including the famous old city of Kief, one of the 
cradles of Russia, was ceded by the Crown to the latter country by the 
treaty of Andruszowo, 1667, and was never gotten back. Kief is con- 
sequently a purely Russian university, which will find no place in our 
treatise on higher education in Poland. 
Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu, in his unsurpassed work, The Empire of the 
Tsars and the Russians, has best expressed this idea, saying: ‘“‘Sepa- 
rated from Great Russia at the time of the Tartar invasion, Little 
Russia was through five centuries subject to Poland and Lithuania, not 
to much purpose. Only the polished surface—the nobility of Kief, 
Volhynia, Podolia—became Polonized. It is owing preeminently to 
the Greek orthodox rite that the bulk of the people, the immense 
majority of the inhabitants of Kief and Ukraina, have turned out 
quite as Russian as the people of Moscow.” Leroy-Beaulieu’s clever 
translator, Zénaide A. Ragozin, shows in a footnote (I, p. 118) that the 
statistician, Tshubinsky, who has published some very detailed statis- 
tical tables on this very subject, has found out that the Peles could not 
muster 100,000 strong in the above three governments put together. 
Even making allowance for some exaggeration in the Russian decu- 
ments, still so much remains that the figure of the genuinely Polish 
population is extremely low. In those three governments the num- 
ber of Catholics, among whom there certainly are non-Polonized Little 
Russians, amounted to scarcely 400,000, or less than a seventh of the 
entire population (16.94 per cent). In these same three governments 
the number of Israelites rose to over 750,000. Unfortunately, Mme. 
Ragozin extends this calculation also to Lithuania and White Russia, 
i.e., to all the provinces annexed in one of the three divisions of 
Poland, without any statistical proof. 
Smolenska also, with the important city of Smolensk, an object of 
strife between Lithuania, Poland, on one hand and Russia on the 
other, was transferred to Russia forever by the treaty of Andruszowo. 
Nor was Inflancka, or Livonia, with the old Hanseatic city of Riga, 
though acquired by Poland in 1561, ever Polish in spirit, or sympathy, 
or civilization. 
Poland, in the strict sense of the term, also called the Crown of 
Poland (Korona), consisting of Great Poland (Wielkopolska) with the 
principal cities of Posen (Poznan), dating from the earliest period of 
the Republic, and Warsaw (Warszawa), which became the capital of 
the country as late as the reign of Sigismund III, and of Little Poland 
(Matopolska) with the famous old capital Cracow (Krakéw), was 
united with Lithuania (Litwa) by the marriage of Jadwiga, the Polish

queen, with Jagiello, duke of Lithuania (1386); a more complete fed- 
eration taking place at Lublin in 1569. The capital was Wilno; the 
official language of the country was White Russian, in which tongue 
its laws were promulgated. With this union Christianity was intro- 
duced. A Polish university was founded at Wilno by Stephen Batory 
under the care of the Jesuits (1578), which for centuries exercised its 
Polish and Roman Catholic influence upon the country, until it was 
suppressed by Emperor Nicholas I (1833) after the outbreak of the 
Polish insurrection of 1830, and the University of Kharkof founded 
in its stead. 
As to amore accurate division of the Rzeczpospolita Polska in Palat- 
inates (Wojewédstwa) for administrative and military purposes I may 
safely refer the reader to Morfill’s Story of Poland (pp. 1-11), who fol-

Vol. I, p. 363. 
THE POLES AND THE DISMEMBERMENT. 
This country was from time immemorial! inhabited by Slavonie 
tribes belonging to the great Indo-European or Aryan family of peoples. 
The early Slavs are said by the best historians to have been a peaceful 
agricultural people living under a patriarchal Democratic rule, without 
priests or kings, but the invasions of Asiatic hordes and the conflicts 
with the German tribes compelled them to adopt a sort of monarchical 
government, But the origin of Poland is fabulous ;” history but begins 
with the reign of Mieczyslaw I and the introduction of Christianity in 
the Latin form under him (965), thus placing Poland at the outset in 
contrast to Russia, whose civilization was to be Greek in the Byzantine 
form. 
Safazik finds the first mentioning of this people in the Geography of 
Ptolemy, who lived in the second century A. D. They are here men- 
tioned under the name of Bulanes. The generally accepted derivation 
of the name is from pole, field, plain, the country being one vast plain. 
Nestor, the old Russian chronicler, distinguishes between the Poliane 
Liakhove on the Vistula and the Poliane Rusove on the Dnieper, the 
dwellers on the Vistula plains and the dwellers on the Dnieper plains. 
Répell, the excellent German historian of Poland,’ has traced. the devel- 
    
!That is after having branched off from their original Iranian or Indo-European 
home in Asia, they immigrated into Europe at a period contemporaneous with or 
rather after the arrival of the Teutonic families. But an autochthonous origin in 
Europe for the entire Indo-European race has been also maintained by such scholars 
as Penka and Schrader (Origines Ariace, Vienna, 1883), Sprachvergleichung und 
Urgeschichte (1885). Morfill has given a very excellent abstract, sifting the fre- 
quently conflicting views of the best Slavonic scholars on the Slavonic origin. (See 
Article “Slavs,” Encycl. Brit., Vol. XXII, pp. 145-147.) 
? Lelewel, the great Polish historian, has relegated all the period of Polish history 
from the earliest times to the reign of Mieczyslaw to the era of myths. 
*The standard history of Poland by Répell has been continued by Caro, both pro- 
fessors of the University of Breslau.

opment of the various divisions of society among the Poles back to their 
origin, showing how the nobility, szlachta (probably derived from the 
German word Geschlecht), became in course of time the Polish nation 
properly so-called, subjecting the cmetones (kmieci), an originally free 
class of peasants, and the peasants strictly so called (chlopi), to abso- 
lute bondage. When in the course of history also the power of the 
king was gradually diminished to a mere shadow by the pacta conventa, 
the military szlachta became the sole and almost absolute bearer of the 
power of the state. In this fact lies the germ of Poland’s destruction, 
which became realized when the “ Adelsrepublik,” as Répell calls it, had 
no other basis than a degraded aristocracy fallen from their old lofty 
patriotism, a national middle class being absolutely wanting, the trade 
of the country being almost entirely in the hands of foreigners, or people 
with foreign proclivities, Germans and Jews.! 
So the dismemberment began, In 1772 Prussia took the Palatinates 
of Malborg (Marienburg), Pomeria (Pomerellen), Warmia (Ermeland), 
Culm, except Danzig and Thorn and a part of Great Poland; Austria 
took Red Russia or Galicia, with a part of Podolia, Sandomir, and 
Cracow; Russia took White Russia, with all the part beyond the Dnie- 
per. The territories seized by the three powers amounted to 13,000 
English square miles, 416,000 inhabitants; 27,000 square miles, 2,700,000 
inhabitants; 42,000 square miles, 1,800,000 inhabitants, respectively. 
But in spite of many fruitless attempts to amend the new constitu- 
tion, promulgated May 2,1791, a second partition by Russia and Prus- 
sia took place in 1793, appropriating to Prussia the remainder of Great 
and a portion of Little Poland (22,000 square miles with 1,100,000 
inhabitants), and advancing the Russian boundary to the center of 
Lithuania and Volhynia (96,000 square miles, 3,000,000 inhabitants). 
In the third and last partition Austria participated, taking Cracow, 
with the country between the Pilica, the Vistula, and the Bug (18,000 
square miles, 1,000,000 inhabitants); Prussia had the capital, with the 
territory as far as the Niemen (21,000 square miles, 1,000,000 inhabit- 
ants); Russia took the rest, amounting to 43,000 square miles, 1,200,000 
inhabitants. 
During the general European upheaval at the time of the Napoleonic 
wars waged against Prussia and Russia (1806-1807) and Austria (1809), 
when the Poles rallied round him a faithful army of patriots, Napoleon 
established the Duchy of Warsaw by the treaty of Tilsit (1807), chiefly 
out of the Prussian share of Poland, with a liberal constitution and 
the Elector of Saxony at its head. The duchy, under the guidance of 
Prince Joseph Poniatowski, wrenched western Galicia from Austria 
  
1 Of course the nobility of Poland differed entirely from the feudal nobility of the 
rest of Europe. The former sprang originally from among the country people. 
There were in Poland many villages, inhabited by a population of nobles only, who 
were as poor as the peasants, yet enjoying the same political rights with the wealth- 
jest magnates.

(1809) after the defeat of the latter at Austerlitz. But with Napoleon’s 
sinking star the grand allied army in 1813 put an end to its existence. 
After the cessions by Austria in 1809 the duchy contained 58,290 
English square miles, with about 4,000,000 inhabitants. 
The division of Poland was rearranged by the congress of Vienna 
in 1815. The original shares of Prussia and Austria were diminished. 
Prussia was to have Posen and what she had gained at the first parti- 
tion. Austria was to have Galicia and the salt mines of Wieliczka, 
while the city and district of Cracow were to form an independent 
republic under the guarantee of the three powers, and were seized by 
Austria only in 1846 after a violent insurrection. The remainder of 
ancient Poland, comprising the chief parts of the recent Grand Duchy 
of Warsaw, reverted to Russia, and was to form a constitutional king- 
dom subject to the Ozar.1 
The country we have to deal with in our report, as finally arranged, 
is as follows: 
Russian Poland, since 1867, for administrative purposes, is divided 
into 10 governments, viz:

Prussian Poland, including Posen, most of Western Prussia, and sev- 
eral districts in Eastern Prussia; 26,000 square miles, 3,000,000 inhab- 
itants. 
Austrian Poland, including Galicia, Lodomeria, Bukovina, and 
Zipsete; 35,500 square miles, 5,000,000 inhabitants. 
If we exempt the German, the Armenian, the Ugro-Finnish, and 
Jewish elements, the bulk of the Polish population proper, according 
to the calculations accompanying the ethnological map of Mirkovich 
(1877), amounts to 4,633,378 in the Russian Empire; 2,404,458 and 
110,000 Kashubes (Kassuben) living on the coast of the Baltic near 
Danzig, in Prussia, and 2,444,200 in Austria. Besides these there are 
10,000 in Turkey. These figures give a gross total of 9,602,036. (Mor- 
fill, Story of Poland, p. 12.) This calculation is very moderate, and I 
am inclined to put it at a rather higher figure. Kropotkine, in his 
excellent article on Russian Poland in the Encyclopedia Britannica 
(ninth edition), numbers in Russia, outside of Poland proper, about 
1,162,050 Poles in 1881. 
  
1 This Kingdom of Poland, or Congress Pelee ieee alone constitutes 
the whole of Russian Poland in the eyes of the Russians, who refuse to recognize as 
Polish the provinces annexed by Catherine IT.   
 
-P-A-G-E-780
  722 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The prevalent religion among the Poles is the Roman Catholic, to 
which in Russian Poland 4,596,956 out of a population of 6,034,430 
belonged (1870). Since the last insurrection a series of measures have 
been taken to reduce the numbers of the Roman Catholic clergy in 
Poland. In1883 there remained 1,313 churches out of 1,401; 1,544 priests 
out of 2,322; 10 monasteries out of 29, and 8 convents out of 30; one 
diocese (Podlasie) having been abolished, and a new one established 
at Kielce, while several bishops had been sent out of the country. The 
whole situation remained unsettled until 1883, when the Pope recog- 
nized the new diocesan subdivisions introduced by the Russian Govern- 
ment. Poland is now divided into four dioceses—Warsaw, Sedomierz, 
Lublin, and Plock. (Kropotkine, Poland, Vol. XIX, pp. 309, 310.) 
The Austrian Poles enjoy absolute religious freedom under their 
Apostolic Emperor of Austria, as well as a practical self-administration 
of their schools in an entirely national Polish spirit. 
In Prussia, too, after the discontinuation of the “ Kulturkampf,” per- 
fect religious peace has been restored. At the old bishopric of Posen- 
Gnesen (Poznati-Gniazno), founded by Mieczyslaw with the aid of St. 
Adalbert of Prague in 968, a Polish archbishop, Stablewski, has been 
inaugurated and confirmed by the German Emperor to further and 
enhance the union and harmony between the Roman Catholic Poles 
and their Lutheran German brethren. This was an act of far-reaching, 
ideal, and political importance—an acknowledgment of the Poles in 
Prussia and their claims as to freedom of language, religion, and a sort 
of home rule, of course within the principles of true Prussian citizen- 
ship and loyalty. The fact that a Polish archbishop occupies the 
seat of St. Adalbert, who for a short time was the second archbishop 
of Gnesen, before he went out to preach the gospel among the heathen 
Prussians! and suffered martyrdom, is a provisional solution of the 
Polish question, the more favorable to the Poles as it thoroughly 
reverses the former policy instituted against them. 
On the whole, no retrogression of the Roman Catholic religion in 
Poland is going on outside of Russia. According to Lelewel the 
population of Poland in 1764 was subdivided as follows in the way 
of the different cults: Catholics, 7,000,000; United Greeks, 1,500,000; 
Protestants, 1,000,000; Orthodox Greek-Russian, 2,000,000; Jews, over 
1,500,000; Mahometans, 50,000; Armenians, 30,000; Mennonites, 20,000; 
Jewish Caraites, 20,000. 
While the Roman Catholic religion is normally growing in Prussian 
Poland, and especially in Austrian Poland, several millions of Russian 
Poles have since the last century been converted to the Orthodox Greek 
religion, owing to the political and social advantages arising therefrom 
and the prodigious spread of Orthodox Greek churches over the country. 
1 It is a curious historical incident that the heathen Prussians, who, with the Letts 
and Lithuanians, belonged to the Litu-Slavic family, for which Leskien has proposed 
the generic name “ Baltic,” should have given their name to that power which forms 
the bone and marrow of the German Empire.

LANGUAGE. 
The language in which the vast and rich treasures of Polish litera- 
ture are stored belongs to the western branch of the Slavonic tongue. 
To this branch belong (1) Polish: Masovian or Mazurian, Great Polish, 
Kashubish, and the upper Silesian dialects, which have very much 
degenerated (Wasserpolnisch). (2) Bohemian: Ozechish, Moravian, 
and Slovakish. (3) Lusatian Wendish or Sorbish, which is gradually 
dying out and will soon be extinct like Polabish. 
The dialect of Great Poland has become the literary language, rich 
and powerful, flexible and sonorous, no Indo-European language except 
Sanscrit presenting such a variety of inflections and sounds to mold it. 
according to all emotions that may pervade man’s breast. But this lan-! 
guage has been deteriorated by foreign unassimilated elements that 
have crept in, just as German was impaired by the invasion of French’ 
in the seventeenth century. When large colonies of Germans began 
to settle in Poland after the Mongolian invasion (1241), which had 
widely devastated the country, and to build many German towns, 
and usurped nearly the entire trade of the country, for which the Poles 
never had either inclination or talent, a large stock of German words 
poured into Polish, giving it a strange alien aspect. As these Ger- 
mans enjoyed, among many other privileges, their own laws also, the 
Jus Magdeburgicum, a ‘“Sonderstaat im Staate,” existed up to Casimir 
the Great’s time, influencing also their judiciary organization. 
With the reign of Sigismund III (1589-1632) the continuous wars and 
invasions of Poland and an all-pervading, very poor church Latin con- 
tributed considerably to bring about a degeneration in the Polish 
language and literature which threatened to suffocate the national 
idiom. The latter lost a great deal of its purity by the entrance of 
bad taste and macaronism. Theological dissertations in the manner of 
the decadence of scholasticism and affected panegyrics supplanted orig- 
inalinvention and did thelanguage itself untold harm. Yet a poet like 
Sarbiewski, who, according to Hugo Grotius, “did not only equal but 
surpassed Horace,” and the poetess Elizabeth Druzbatska, show such 
purity of style and grace, such delicacy of thought and taste, that the 
inroad of all macaronism and pedantry in speech and literature could 
not stamp out the slumbering force of the Polish language. Still many 
unnecessary Latinisms disfigure the Polish language, which is not 
strange, since this macaronic period can be said to have lasted from 
1606 to 1764. Yet, in flexibility, richness, power, and harmony, Polish 
is not excelled by any other language in Europe; its grammatical 
structure is fully developed and firmly established, its orthography 
precise and perfect. Morfill rightly quotes the poet Casimir Brod- 
zinki’s beautiful and expressive characterization of his native tongue: 
Let the Pole smile with manly pride when the inhabitant of the banks of the 
Tiber or Seine calls his language rude; let him hear with keen satisfaction and the

dignity of a judge the stranger who painfully struggles with the Polish pronuncia- 
tion like a Sybarite trying to lift an old Roman coat of armor, or when he strives to 
articulate the language of men with the weak accent of children. So long as cour- 
age is not lost in our nation, while our manners have not become degraded, let us 
not disavow this manly roughness of our language. It has its harmony, its melody, 
but it is the murmur of an oak of three hundred years, and not the plaintive and 
feeble cry of a reed, swayed by every wind. 
It would be impossible to give a fair idea of the grammatical struc- 
ture of the language in a short survey of its phonetics, forms, and 
grammatical differences from the other sister languages. But a few 
hints at its nature may induce some reader to take recourse to one of 
the many excellent Polish grammars; besides, it may be considered 
necessary to have at least a vague insight into the language which 
was the basis of the educational system of a great realm and is still the 
medium through which education, culture, and the history and litera- 
ture of a great past is inculcated in 10,000,000 souls. 
Its structure.—The Slavonic languages, it should be first noticed, do 
not differ from one another to such an extent as, for instance, the Teu- 
tonic or even the Romance languages. A Slav who knows his language 
to perfection will, I dare say, always be able to understand and to make 
himself understood among the other peoples of his race or at least of 
his subdivision (Southeast and West). The Low German dialect of 
Holstein and the Swiss dialect certainly differ very much more than 
Polish, Bohemian, and Lusatian. 
The principal changes in the various Slavonic languages have been 
brought about under the destructive influence exercised by the vowel 
i and the semivowel j upon the preceding consonants. Thus many 
mutes were reduced to mere hissing sounds; hence comes this charac- 
teristic sibilation so frequent in the Slavonic languages, though not 
equally so in all of them. 
The apparent heaping of consonants, especially at the beginning of 
syllables, by which so many are deterred from studying the languages, 
fearing the impossibility of pronouncing them, is really no heaping at 
all. Many of these consonants are liquid, and if not, they become 
liquid (mouillé) by very pure and sonorous vowels following them to 
modify any harshness that may arise. This prejudice against the 
harshness of the Slavonic languages has been largely created by the 
uncomfortable orthography in the Polish language, which frequently 
expresses one sound by a combination of two, nay, four consonants; 
thus Polish sz, ez, szcz are expressed in Russian by one sign. Though 
not harsh, Polish has more hissing sounds than any other Slavonic 
language. 
‘The name of the Slavs properly means illustrious, glorious; slava, slavitsa (old 
Slavonic), glory; slavinu, glorious; Lithuanian szlowe, glory, derived from old Sla- 
vonic sluti, to hear; church Slavonic slysza, I hear; sluch, the reputation; modern 
Russian slyszat; Polish stuchaé, to hear, also in the sense of bene audire. Hence 
Russian Slavjanin, slavjanskij; Polish Slowianin, Slowjanski; Czech Slovan, Slo- 
vansky, for Slay, Slavonic.
-P-A-G-E-783
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 725 
In regard to grammatical forms the Slavonic languages are infinitely 
superior to the Germanic and Neolatin languages. They are closer 
related to the synthetic languages, the nouns having no articles (but, 
of course, demonstrative pronouns), and the verbs being almost always 
conjugated without personal pronouns. 
The Polish language has a most elaborate declensional system, com- 
prising seven cases, by which the use of prepositions is limited and a 
great freedom of position of words insured in the sentences. Like San- 
scrit, it possesses the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, 
instrumentalis, locativus, wanting only the ablative. The noun has 
one of the three genders, but has lost the dual, which still exists in the 
Masovian dialect. It also has more diminutives and augmentatives 
than either Latin! or Italian. 
The adjectives have diminutives and augmentatives besides the three 
degrees, as, for instance, maty, small; comparative, mniejszy; superla- 
tive, najmniejszy ; diminutive, malutki, malenki; zielony, green; zielon- 
awy, greenish. 
The verbs, by means of the so-called “aspects,” have very delicate 
distinctions of meaning in the conditions of time, and even gender, 
quite unknown in the other modern languages. They have causative, 
iterative, inceptive, perfective, durative, participial, etc., forms, which 
contribute a great deal to the lucidity of grammatical constructions. 
Every root word thus becomes, according to the great philologist 
Schleicher, the germ of a largely ramified tree of derivative forms, each 
of which expresses a different sense. There is a creative vitality in 
their forms infinitely superior to the rigid, decrepit crystallization of 
the Germanic and Latin languages, as Schleicher puts it. 
Less remote from Palo-Slavonic than Russian, for instance, it has 
preserved some peculiar characteristics of the mother tongue, among 
them a (pronounced like French salon) and ¢ (satin). 
44 is another consonant which does not exist in any other lan- 
guage. 
It is similar to llin Spanish, and has a peculiarly broad and thick sound. 
The phonetic wealth of the language is expressed by 35 consonants, 
9 vowels, and 1 letter j, which is considered to be a semivowel and semi- 
consonant. 
The accent, except in foreign words and in compounds, which are 
exceedingly rare, is constantly on the penultimate—rédak, countryman; 
genitive, rodaka; dative, rodakéwi. 
In Polish words the syllable with the vowel which has the tonic 
accent is long; the other syllables are short. Thus the Polish language 
combines the advantages of the prosody of ancient poetry with those 
of the rhyme of modern; it possesses all the varieties of poetical forms 
from the Latin hexameter to the French Alexandrinian verse. 
1 That means a good deal when we consider such diminutive possibilities, like cista, 
cistula, cistella, cistellula.   
 
-P-A-G-E-784
  726 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The Polish language [says Schleicher] distinguishes itself among the other Sla- 
vonic idioms particularly by a varied and manifold softening of the consonants. 
This delicate expression of sounds, produced by the continual variations of the same 
consonants, makes this language very difficult for the foreigner; but in the mouths 
of educated Poles it is not harsh at all. 
Among the Indo-European languages the Germanic languages possess not one soft- 
ened (modified) consonant; the Romance languages but one—softened n (gn in 
French and Italian, i in Spanish); the Slavonic languages have several consonants 
of that kind. Polish, though harsher than several among them, has the most. 
The total cf words in the Polish language amounts to about 100,000, 
a great number among them being, as in the Neolatin languages, com- 
posed of verbs or nouns preceded by prepositions. The words composed 
of substantives and verbs or two substantives, so common in German, 
are very rare in Polish. Almost all the feminine substantives and 
adjectives in Polish, as in the other Slavonic and in the Neolatin 
languages (except French) have the termination a; and the great 
number of Polish words terminating with vowels serve to soften the 
harshness of the language indisputable in other respects. 
On the whole, however, we may adopt Schnitzler’s statement: 
Original, flexible, sonorous as it is, Polish is as rich in forms as it is in words, so 
that it easily expresses all the ideas to be conveyed and adopts all possible sounds. 
One may say that Polish is a scholarly language, which has been elaborated, polished, 
refined by numerous authors, some of whom, men of first order, are justly counted 
by the Poles among their titles of glory and as a compensation for their political 
disasters. 
Sueh an account of the most striking characteristics of the language 
may appear as a digression from my theme, but the language spoken 
by the people is the very skeleton upon which the structure of their 
education is built. And as their language is practically unknown with 
us, it seems to me an indispensable preliminary step to my treatise on 
the higher education in Poland. 
SKETCH OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND DURING HER 
INDEPENDENCE. 
The introduction of Christianity into Poland under Mieczyslaw, or 
Mieczko, to use the abridged form of his name, took place as already 
stated, in its Latin form. The Latin alphabet was adopted, and the 
Latin language became the sacred language of the nation. From 
the church, Latin soon penetrated everywhere, into the schools, the 
administration, the tribunals, and the domain of history and letters. 
The exclusive use of Latin as the literary language during several 
centuries arrested in Poland all progress and all development of the 
national language, and, worst of all, debarred the broad masses of : 
the people from participating in the literary movement of the time. 
But, on the other hand, the knowledge of Latin was soon followed by 
reading the books of the clerical and secular authors who rapidly 
spread over Poland. Thus the bad results of “‘Latinomania,” of which
-P-A-G-E-785
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 727 
some Polish writers so bitterly complain, were partly compensated by 
the intense literary aspirations of the higher classes. 
Mieezko’s successor, Boleslaw the Great (992-1026), in order to spread 
Christianity more effectively among the Poles, invited some Benedictine 
monks from France and founded monasteries on Lysa Gora, at Siecie- 
chowa, and Tynec, and around the monasteries schools of various kinds 
arose, just like the “Klosterschulen” in Germany under Charlemagne. 
From the eleventh century on [says Leonard Chodzko] libraries were established 
in Poland. In 1166 the historian Matthew Cholewa, bishop of Cracow, incessantly 
quotes the Digesta and the Institutiones Romane, which had been discovered in 
Italy about 40 years before. Also quotations from the Roman historian Valerius, all 
traces of whose works have since been lost, are found in the Latin chronicles of that 
Polish bishop. The Polish schools and libraries in the twelfth century were in the 
same flourishing condition as those of the Latin races. 
Jan Dlugosz (Longinus), the famous canon of Cracow (1415-1486), in 
his most important Latin chronicle, extending from the earliest periods 
of his country’s history to his own time, speaks of Polish schools that 
were said to have existed in Poland during the eleventh century. 
At the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth 
centuries the young Polish students frequented the universities of 
Padua, Bologna, and Paris, in which several of their compatriots, as 
Nicolas of Cracow, Jan Grot de Huplé, and Przeslaw, were installed as 
professors and even rectors. 
There was even a dim, flickering light of natural science awakening 
in Poland, inasmuch as the mathematician Ciolek (Vitellio), who lived 
in the second half of the fourteenth century, became one of the origina- 
tors of the science of optics. 
The reign of Casimir the Great (1333-1370) marks the dawn of a new 
era in the literary, educational, and political history of Poland. This 
King, who at the diet of Wislica, in 1347, had the celebrated statute of 
Wislica enacted—the first monument of Polish jurisprudence, and a 
code destined to rule the Kingdom according to principles of higher 
statesmanship'—is the founder of the University of Cracow. 
Ancient foundation of the University of Cracow; its early history.— 
The city of Cracow had become prominent as the capital under Ladis- 
laus Lokietek (lokiec, an ell), who was the first monarch crowned there. 
Under his great son and successor, Casimir III, Cracow (also Danzig) 
became a member of the Hanseatic League. 
In 1364 the foundation of the University of Cracow was laid in the 
  
1 The most eminent Polish jurist, Francis Wolowski, states concerning the statute: 
“One is struck with astonishment at the thought that this first Polish code, remark- 
able by its wisdom and the clemency of its dispositions, precedes by nine years the 
celebrated golden bull of Emperor Charles IV of Germany, which in relation to its 
penal legislation still breathes to a high degree the barbarities of the Middle Ages.” 
In the statute there is a strong attempt to raise the wretched condition of the “ misera 
contribuens plebs,” which procured for Casimir the title of honor of “the peasants’ 
king” (Kr6l chlopéw).

village of Wawel (now Kazimierz, the suburb of Cracow). Podeza- 
szynski maintains its creation in 1347, which date would make it the 
oldest university of the north and east of Europe. But Lelewel, the 
best authority, has put it in 1364, and Friedrich Paulsen, in his 
admirable Wesen und Geschichtliche Entwickelung der Deutschen 
Universitiiten (Die Deutschen Universitiiten, W. Lexis, I, Berlin, 1893), 
states: 
Prague and Vienna are the first founded German universities, the former? estab- 
lished in 1348 by the house of Luxemburg, the latter in 1365 by the house of Habs- 
burg, both on the castern side of the German domain of culture, apparently for the 
reason that Paris was near enough to the west, with which the oldest church institu- 
tions on the Rhine, especially Cologne, were closely connected. Only toward the 
end of the century did the west of Germany follow with the universities of Heidel- 
berg (1385) and Cologne (1388, discontinued 1794), Middle Germany with Erfurt 
(1392, discontinued 1816). Tho dissolution of the University of Paris, owing to the 
great church schism, brought about the foundation of these three universities. 
In Cologne, the old seat of scholastic education, Albertus Magnus 
and Thomas Aquinas, as well as the Minorite, Duns Scotus, had excelled. 
To replace Prague, lost 10 the Germans by the Hussite troubles, the 
University of Leipsic was founded in 1409, that of Rostock for the 
Baltic countries in 1419. 
This digression is made to show that Poland was not behind Germany 
in her aspirations, at least for educational excellency, and was well 
nigh the first to found a university. 
Organized after the model of that of Paris, the University of Cracow 
propagated in Poland all the sciences cultivated at that time in France, 
grammar, logic, metaphysics, the physical and mathematical sciences, 
jurisprudence, politics, morals, astrology, and music, i. e., a studium 
generale of the three faculties—law, medicine, and philosophy. 
Thus, like the German universities, and preceding all but one, Cra- 
cow derived its origin from Paris, the first great university of the 
Occident, ‘ex diluvio scientiarum studii Parisiensis.” Yet the inde- 
pendently created universities of Italy, especially that of Bologna, 
originating in a law school, must have exercised their influence upon 
Cracow. While, then, the oldest universities of France, Italy, Spain, 
and England date back to the thirteenth and with their roots to the 
twelfth centuries, the oldest Polish and the German universities take 
a contemporaneous start in the second half of the fourteenth century.? 
  
1Perhaps he accepted as date the year 1364 because in this year Pope Urban V 
raised it to the rank of other similar institutions in Europe. 
? The university was divided among four nations—Bohemians, Poles, Saxons, Baya- 
rians. The spirit of rivalry among them was strongly manifested in the quarrels 
which took place between the national and the German party. <A privilege granted 
to the Germans and revoked by Charles IV on the 6th of October, 1409, produced such 
discontent that all the German students left Prague, which caused the foundation of 
the University of Leipsic. 
3 At the same time a reform of education was begun among the lowest strata of 
the nation. Primary schools were established throughout the country admitting 
the children of the peasants as well as those of the nobles.

Of course, the University of Cracow had its vicissitudes and draw- 
backs. There was at first a lack of professors, and consequently no defi- 
nite results of teaching were obtained. Under Casimir’s successor, 
Louis of Hungary (1370-1382), the university came to a standstill, and 
the Polish students passed over to Prague, where they formed one of 
the four nations. The French and Italian universities were also fre- 
quented by many Polish students who later on obtained fame in their 
fatherland. But the-plan of Casimir in regard to the University of 
Cracow was fully carried out by Queen Jadwiga and Ladislaus Jagiello 
of Lithuania. The statutes of the university were approved by Pope 
Boniface IX, its revenues raised by the Queen in 1397, and the institu- 
tion transferred to the center of the city in 1400. Throngs of students 
from all Poland, Hungary, and Germany assembled there eu carried 
its fame in all directions.1 
Under the Jagiellons (1386-1548) the Polish language, so long dis- 
placed by Latin, began to reconquer its ancient privileges. It owed its 
success especially to the Hussites, who had entered Poland in order to 
recruit in favor of their doctrines from all ranks of society that could 
be reached only by means of the national language. The Polish 
humanists and reformers’? also used Polish in their liturgies, printed in 
the vernacular catechisms, sermons, religious songs, employed it in 
their controversies, and thus forced their adversaries to reply in the 
same idiom.’ 
Printing began at a very early time in Poland (Estreicher, Polish 
Bibliography, Cracow, 1870). As early as 1475 we find a Silesian- 
Polish imprint in a Latin work, Statuta Synodalia. In 1476 appeared 
a work by Turrecremata (Torquemada), Explanatio in Psalterium, pub- 
lished in Cracow. Since that time the printing press has not stopped 
in Poland. 
In 1491 Swiantopelk Fiol printed at Cracow a book of prayers in 
Slavonian, with Cyrillic letters. In the beginning of the sixteenth 
century, Haller, a citizen of Cracow, established the first regular book 
trade, employing at first foreign presses, namely, those of Leipsic and 
Nuremberg, but afterwards establishing his own printing office at 
Cracow. Haller rendered great services to the progress of literature 
in Poland by publishing himself many works, and by supporting other 
printers with advances of money and types, so that many new pene 
offices were soon opened at Cracow. 
  
1 Huss’s fellow: martyr, Hieronymus of Prague, Ww was called to Cracow in 1410, in 
order to help at the reorganization of that university. 
*Kallenbach, Les Humanistes Polonais, Fribourg, 1891. 
8A very interesting and most important transaction between Poland and Bohemia 
was the public disputation held at the University of Cracow in 1431 between the 
Hussite deputies of Bohemia and the Roman Catholic doctors of the university. 
The disputation was carried on in the presence of the King and the senate. Dlu- 
gosz, who relates that memorable transaction, says that the couferences were 
almost continually held in Polish. The fact alone that heretical tenets were 
suffered to be publicly discussed at the university is sufficient to prove the state of 
toleration at that time prevailing in Poland.
-P-A-G-E-788
  730 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The first Polish book, a life of St. John Chrysostom, by St. Bonaven- 
tura, translated by Opec, was printed at Cracow in 1522, by Vietor; 
and in 1536 the Catechism of Luther was also published in Polish. 
The liberty of the press, established by royal ordinance in 1539, was 
sustained in spite of all attempts to suppress it during the fierce 
religious struggles raging at the time in Poland as well as in western 
Europe. Printing establishments were even increased in all parts of 
Poland, for the Reformers tried to spread their doctrines by the press, 
and their Catholic opponents to refute them by the same means. 
The followers of the Greek Orthodox Church in Poland, whose 
spiritual center was in Kief and its famous Greek seminary until 1667, 
when lost to Muscowy forever, had also several presses of their own. 
The religious struggles, fatal as they were in many respects, yet had 
a powerful influence on the development of the national intellect. 
Theological controversies compelled those concerned in them not only 
to be well versed in the Scriptures and the works of the church fathers 
but also in the ancient languages, Polish dialects, and many other 
kindred branches of human learning. Works not only of a religious 
and controversial but also of a literary and’ scientific character went 
forth in great numbers from the presses established in various parts 
of Poland. There were even many private presses established by 
nobles in their own houses; thus the Tarnowskis, Radziwills, Chodz- 
kiewiez, and several other magnates possessed printing establishments. 
Bandke, in his History of the Press in Cracow, even enumerates 46 
towns outside of Poland where the productions of Polish authors were 
also printed. 
This glorious elevation of liberty of the press and education did not, 
however, last undisturbed. Under the reign of Sigismund III a kind 
of censorship was introduced by a royal decree of the 14th of October, 
1621, prohibiting the printing or even the custody of any works what- 
soever, but particularly those of a sacred character, without a license 
from ecclesiastical authority. The resolution adopted by the synod of 
Warsaw under the primate Lubienski (De non imprimendis absque 
revisione et approbatione libris, ac revidendis ad minus semel in anno 
bibliothecis bibliopolisque), which not only confirmed this royal decree, 
but extended the censorship by establishing an inquisitorial revision of 
libraries and booksellers’ shops, became from that time a law, and its 
application was stringently adhered to. Under this law, which soon 
extended its sway over books of the past, excesses were committed, 
and a good number of the best productions of the golden age of Polish 
literature must have been irrevocably lost, and many became so searce 
that even at our time some valuable unique copy is now and then found 
hidden away in the dust of old Polish libraries. 
This short account of the Polish printing press may perhaps appear 
as a digression from our theme, but the universities and high schools 
‘ 6f that time were so closely connected with the new printing facilities 
   
-P-A-G-E-789

that they can hardly be appreciated without the latter, being the most 
powerful engine for the dissemination of the truth and of all learning. 
Thousands of students gathered at the University of Cracow in the fif- 
teenth century from Ruthenia, Russia, Germany, Hungary, and Moravia. 
The first Ruthenian, Latin, Hebrew, Greek, and Hungarian books pro- 
ceeded from its printing press. At the beginning of the sixteenth cen- 
tury it extended all over Poland. The number of books printed in 
Poland during the sixteenth century amount to 10,000 at a low caleula- 
tion. More than 500 printing presses had been up to the end of the 
eighteenth century active in about 100 towns of the realm, 90 in Cracow 
alone. 
One of the most interesting buildings in Cracow is the old Jagiello 
Library, with its quaint quadrangle. Here is stored a fine collection — 
of books and many of the rarest treasures of the Polish press, early edi- 
tions of the native authors. “In an album preserved in the library, 
with the names of visitors inserted, may be seen the autograph of 
Henry of Valois, Marini, Mniszek, the bride of the False Demetrius, and 
that of Anna Jagiellonka, the wife of the glorious Stephen Batory” 
(Morfill). All these treasures were turned to the advantage of the 
Jagiellon University. 
Among the most famous students of this university at that period we 
must count the above-mentioned historian and chronicler, Jan Dlugosz; 
Jan of Glogau, who introduced Aristotle’s philosophy into Poland, on 
which he wrote several works; Michael of Breslau, Jan of Oswiecim 
and scores of others. But none gave to his country such a luster of 
splendor and fame as Nicolas Copernic (Copernicus), born in 1473 at 
Thorn (Toruh), Prussian Poland, died the 23d of May, 1543. The great 
French scientist, Arago, says of his death: “Il s’ éteignit en tenant 
dans ses mains défaillantes le premier exemplaire de Vouvrage qui 
devait répandre sur la Pologne une gloire si éclatante et si pure.” A 
statue of Copernic, by the finest Danish seulptor, Thorwaldsen, adorns 
one of the public squares of Warsaw. 
It is true Poland and Germany still dispute with each other the 
honor of producing him, a common fate of all great men in olden times; 
but this much is sure, that his father, a Polish subject, was a Slay, 
though perhaps Germanized, his native town having recently belonged 
to the order of the Teutonic Knights. His mother, as her name—Bar- 
bel Watzelrode—indicates, must have been of German extraction. 
Brought up under the guardianship of his uncle, Lucas Watzelrode, 
subsequently prince-bishop of Warmia, he matriculated at Cracow in 
1491, and there studied mathematics, optics, and perspective. Leaving 
Cracow without taking a degree, he enrolled himself in 1496 in the 
“Natio Germanorum” of Bologna University as a student of canon 
law. The year 1500 he spent at Rome, where he lectured on astronomy 
“and “observed an eclipse of the moon” on the 6th of November. The 
following year he began the study of medicine at Padua, medicine being
-P-A-G-E-790
  732 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
at that time essentially dependent on astrology. In 1505 he left Italy 
never to return to it, and settled in Prussia. 
He is the founder of modern astronomy. The Copernican system is, 
mainly, the shifting of the center of the solar system from the earth to 
the sun, and the consequent explanation of the alternation of day and 
night by the earth’s rotation on its own axis, and of the change of the 
seasons by the earth’s revolution around the sun. For the rest, tlie 
glory of developing the lines so broadly laid down belongs to Kepler, 
Galileo, and to Newton, who finally marked out the form of modern 
theoretical astronomy. : 
Under Sigismund I (1507-1548) political struggles with the Tartars 
and Turks and thé rising power of Russia strangely contrasted with 
literary achievements. His second wife, Bona Sforza, daughter of the 
Duke of Milan, though personally hurtful to her adopted realm on 
account of her intrigues and avarice, yet had a beneficial effect upon 
the country by the introduction of painters and artists of various kinds 
and Italian refinement to embellish the Polish court. 
The new doctrines of the Reformation made their appearance in 
the country. The centrifugal forces began to tend in different direc- 
tions; the Protestant towns of secularized Prussia, and still more the 
Polish towns proper that had adopted Lutheranism, gradually became 
estranged from Poland at the time when royalty was being weakened 
more and more, and the nobility with their unmeasured privileges spread 
the sphere of their influence ever farther. 
But in the clash and conflict of diverging tendencies lay the germ 
and ferment of a higher educational and intellectual life. The influ- 
ence of the Renaissance began to be felt in Poland, and when the clas- 
sical models of Greece and Rome pervaded the national spirit of the 
Polish republic of letters the national language assumed an exquisite 
purity; its golden age and classical period began (1541-1606). But the 
University of Cracow had somehow degenerated, and King Sigismund, 
in order to raise its standard, in 1535 ennobled all the doctors and pro- 
fessors of the same, uttering the following grand words: “Satius enim 
est gestis propriis florere quam maiorum opinione uti nec miner nobili- 
tas est ea que propriis virtutibus comparatur” (Morfill, Poland, p. 82). 
But trouble soon began again. It may not be uninteresting as a 
piece of history of culture in Polish university life of that time to speak 
here at some length of an event by which the beginning of the reign of 
Sigismund Augustus was marked, and which, although insignificant 
in itself, was important from its consequences. 
In 1549 a woman of ill repute, being publicly insulted by some 
students of the university who stood before the door of All-Hallows 
College, called to her assistance the servants of Czarnkowski, pre- 
bendary of Cracow and principal of this college. A scuffle ensued, in 
which some students were killed. This occurrence produced a univer- 
sal commotion amongst all the students of the university, who entered  
-P-A-G-E-791
HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 733 
into a mutual obligation to obtain a signal satisfaction for the murder 
of their comrades. The whole body of the students went to the royal 
castle to supplicate for justice against the perpetrators of the murder, 
but particularly against Czarnkowski, whom they accused of being the 
chief promoter of that crime. Samuel Maciejowski, bishop of Cracow, 
' dissuaded them from thus marching to the castle, representing it as an 
insult to royalty, and promised to obtain for them full redress. 
They retired from the castle, and, having confirmed their mutual 
obligation to prosecute the guilty, they chose one of their number to 
lead the prosecution. They declared also that if they should not 
obtain justice they would leave the university and even the country. 
The King granted an audience to a deputation of the students, who 
preferred an accusation, the violence of which shows the hatred which 
animated them against the ecclesiastical authorities and which waited 
only for an opportunity to manifest itself. The King blamed the riotous 
conduct of the students, and ordered the affair to be investigated by 
Samuel Maciejowski, bishop of Cracow, as chancellor of the university, 
a prelate distinguished by the mildness of his character and urbanity 
of his manner. The students did not appear before the judge, con- 
sidering him as a partial one, and refused to prosecute their accusation. 
Ozarnkowski, having proven that he had not even been in the house 
when the tumult arose, was justly declared innocent, but the servants 
were imprisoned. As no accuser, however, appeared, there was no trial. 
The students resolved on leaving the university. It was impossible to 
use any coercion against such a resolution, and the authorities tried by 
conciliatory means to prevent its execution. 
The students were. invited to the Church of St. I'ranciscus, where 
they found assembled all the university, the bishop of Cracow, and 
Jan Tarnowski, the most respected grandee of his time. They were 
addressed by Tarnowski, who promised them the punishment of the 
guilty, and who was listened to with great attention; but when the 
bishop wished to speak he was interrupted and could not obtain a 
hearing. The students left the church with great tumult and resolved 
on leaving the city the following day. Cracow exhibited a mournful 
scene; nothing was heard but groans, lamentations, and parting fare- 
wells. The town lost the most animated and brilliant part of its popu- 
lation. According to the word of Zalaszowski, a contemporary author, 
in his Jus publicum Regni Poloniz, “the schools became silent; the 
halls of the university were deserted; the churches were mute, and the 
oldest inhabitant of Cracow had never witnessed a greater calamity 
and a more general lamentation.” 
The emigrant students assembled together, heard mass in a church 
of the suburb Kleparz, and began their pilgrimage singing a sacred 
hymn. Some of them were persuaded to return, but the greatest part 
left the country and repaired to foreign universities. Most of these 
went to Silesia, where the celebrated school of Goldberg was at that
-P-A-G-E-792
  734 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
time in a very flourishing condition, under the direction of Franken- 
dorf, the most eminent of Melanchthon’s pupils. This scheol was 
already the favorite resort of many Polish students. The later royal 
family of Leszezynski was one of those who generally educated their 
children in that establishment. Many went also to the newly erected _ 
University of Kénigsberg, in Prussia, which was a Protestant strong- 
hold under the duke, Albert of Prussia, who had adopted the reformed 
ereed. No wonder, then, that most of them returned to Poland imbued 
with Protestant doctrines and as zealous propagators of such in their 
Catholic country." 
Yet, in spite of drawbacks and religious struggles, the progress of 
Polish literature and literary achievements went on. 
Nicholas Rej (1505-1569)? opens the long list of great Polish poets, 
though his best work, Zwierciadto albo zywot poczciwego czlowieka 
(The Mirror; or, The Life of an Honorable Man) was written in prose. 
Martin Bielski wrote in Polish the Annals of the History of Poland 
and a Universal Chronicle, the first universal historical work that 
appeared in Europe. Great historians, philologists, jurists, scientists, 
and the most illustrious Polish poet, Jan Kochanowski, make us well 
understand that the sixteenth century was the golden age of Polish 
literature. 
Another cause of this marvelous development is that merit was a 
veritable title of nobility. Talent could attain any office, however 
elevated. 
Every bishop, every senator, every high magistrate [says Leonard Chodzko] owed 
at that time his elevation to his talents, and the son of a noble, a burgher, or a 
peasant found the same admittance. The historian Kromer, son of a peasant, and 
the poet Dantiscus, son of a brewer, rose consecutively togthe bishopric of Warmia 
with the title of prince-bishops. Erasmus Ciolek, natural son of a wandering 
musician, became bishop of Plock. Janicki, son of a cartwright, obtained the poet’s 
erown from the hands of the Pope. Cardinal Stanislas Hosius, one of the presi- 
dents of the Council of Trent, was born in Wilno, of very obscure origin. 
We can infer from this what the condition of the schools in Poland 
at that time must have been. 
Not only did the lower and middle classes produce highly educated 
men, but the nobles also rivaled in culture and education at a period 
when the nobility in France and Germany, with the exception of men 
like Franz von Sickingen and especially Ulrich von Hutten, were sunk in 
ignorance. The famous French historian, De Thou (Thuanus), speaking 
of the embassy of Polish nobles who came to ofier the crown of Poland 
to Henry of Valois in 1572, says: 
The most remarkable thing was their facility in expressing themselves in Latin, 
French, German, and Italian; these four languages were as familiar to them as their 
own tongue. There could be found only two men at the court who could respond in 
Latin, the Baron of Milhau and the Marquis of Castelnau-Maurissiére. These had

HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 735 
been dispatched expressly in order to sustain in this respect the honor of the French 
nobility that then blushed at their ignorance. And indeed it was a great deal for 
that time to blush at all. The Poles spoke our language with so-much purity that 
you would have rather taken them for men born on the banks of the Seine or the 
Loire than for inhabitants of the regions watered by the Vistula or the Dnieper, 
which gave great shame to our courtiers, who know nothing and who are declared 
enemies of all that is called science. 
Rightly indeed Erasmus of Rotterdam says of the Poles in his letter 
to Severin Bonar, “In that country philosophy possesses excellent 
disciples; there it forms those Polish citizens who dare to be scholars.” 
The famous Muretus (1526-1585) also, when comparing the two nations 
considered the most polished and scholarly at that time, the Italians 
and Poles, asks himself: 
Which of the two nations is the one that deserves to be praised more in regard to 
the sciences and arts? The Italians, the fifth part of whom hardly study Greek and 
‘Latin and show some taste for the sciences, or the Poles, a great number of whom 
perfectly know the two languages and seem to be animated by such an ardor for the 
letters that they devote their whole lives to them? 
Under Stephen Batory (1576-1586), a powerful and well-meaning 
monarch, due regard was paid to letters and education. He founded 
for Lithuania the University of Wilno under the superintendency of the 
Jesuits, who, in order to counteract the spread of Protestantism in these 
Catholic countries, were now swarming into Poland in great numbers, 
and gradually became the masters of the educational system of the 
country. But this university was unfortunately at that time not a bul- 
wark of the Polish or even White Russian language, which continued 
in use in judicial proceedings as late as the year 1697 in Lithuania, for 
Batory, originally a prince of Transylvania, can not be said to have 
had a strong inclination for the Polish language, and the Jesuits also 
by far preferred their church Latin. Safatik even accuses Batory of 
having directly done harm to the Polish vernacular by favoring Latin 
too much at its expense. He also founded Jesuit colleges at Dorpat 
and Riga, Livonia having been united to the Republic in 1561,! and he 
proved an offensive foe to Lutheranism. A convent of Jesuits was 
founded at Riga under the direction of Laterna, Skarga, and Briick- 
ner, all three zealous propagators of Catholic restoration in Poland. 
Reproaches against these men that they were wanting in patriotism 
are certainly unjust and unfounded. Skarga’s sermons, preached before 
the diet (Kazania Sejmowe, 1600), remind the Poles with ardent elo- 
quence of the suicidal consequences of their disunion and reproach 
them for their utter want of unselfish patriotism. His funeral dis- 
courses at the burial of Batory’s widow and the first wife of Sigismund 
IIL are not unlike those of Bossuet in powerful eloquence.? But violent 
riots followed the King’s attempts to suppress Protestantism in Livonia, 
and a probable religious war was only averted by his death, when he

was just about founding a university in Livonia, which thirty-five 
years later was lost to Sweden. 
In Poland and Lithuania, however, Catholicism from this time on 
had the upper hand and molded the education of the country. 
The University of Wilno was founded by Batory as the chief seat of 
the Jesuits in Lithuania, in the center of a population a large majority 
of which was Protestant and Greek. A great opposition arose against 
its foundation. Prince Radziwill, palatine of Wilvo and grand chan- 
cellor of Lithuania, as well as the vice-chancellor, Eustachius Wollo- 
witz, refused to fix the seal of the State to the charter for the university; 
but the King disregarded their representations. Also the diet of 1585 
protested against the erection of the University of Wilno, and of the 
Jesuit college in the newly conquered town of Polock, deeming the sole 
authority of the monarch insufficient and unconstitutional. But the 
influence of the King prevailed over the opposition of the diet and the 
privileges of these foundations were at last confirmed. The University 
of Dorpat was founded by the Swedish King Charles XI, and became 
a bulwark of German learning. Only in these days is it becoming 
thoroughly Russianized; it has now even lost its old name, the Russian 
name for it being Jurjew. 
. But with the reign of Sigismund III (1587-1632), the continuous wars 
and foreign invasions, the bloody religious, external, and internal strifes, 
which retarded civilization in all eastern Europe for centuries, made a 
speedy end to that great period in Polish literary history. Foreign ele- 
ments came up to take charge of the public instruction in the country 
in spite of the opposition of the University of Cracow. Briefly, the old 
maxim of “Inter arma Muse silent” proved true again. The above- 
mentioned period of decadence, the macaronic period, set in, barely 
illuminated by a few superior lights. Polemical divinity, the principal 
subject of instruction in the schools, made the students lose their time 
in dialectic subtleties and quibbles. About 1618 the censorship was 
established in Poland, though contrary to a royal decree of 1539, which 
had proclaimed the liberty of the press. The first index librorum 
prohibitorum was published by the bishop of Cracow in 1617. The 
University of Cracow had a hard struggle with the Jesuits, who 
worked hard to get possession of this ancient seat of learning. They 
tried to establish a high school of their own at Cracow, which would 
have facilitated the final accomplishment of the object. This occa- 
sioned a violent quarrel between the Jesuits and the university, which 
was supported on that occasion by all the monastic orders. The issue 
was decided in favor of the university by the Diet of 1628, and a papal 
bull of 1634 prohibited its renewal. 
The Jesuit schools spread over Poland, and the superintendence of 
national education was in their hands. Broscius (Brozek), rector of the 
university of Cracow, and the most learned man of his time in Poland, 
in a work published in Polish, about 1620, under the title Dialogue

between a Landowner and a Parish Priest, violently attacks their 
system of education. 
The Polish language, which had attained a high degree of perfection 
during the sixteenth century, the Augustan cra of its literature, was 
soon corrupted by an absurd admixture with Latin and barbaric phrases, 
called “macaronic,” which disgraced native literary productions for 
more than a century. Bombastic panegyrics, lavished on the most 
unimportant persons, became, toward the end of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, almost the only literature of the country—proof sufficient of the 
degraded state of the public to which such productions could be accept- 
able. A further proof of the intellectual degradation and the corruption 
of taste at that time in Poland is that the most classical productions of 
the golden era of Polish literature were not reprinted during a space 
of more than a century, although after the revival of learning they 
went through many editions and still continue to be reprinted. Thus 
the poems of Jan Kochanowski (died 1584) were printed several times 
before 1639; but from that year there was no new edition till 1767, 
which has since been followed by many others. 
Polish schools at the period of the Reformation.—With the spread of 
Protestantism the need of Protestant schools was felt. Several general 
synods, chiefly those of Piotrkow (1578) and of Thorn (1595), acknowl- 
edged the necessity of establishing a general school of highest learning 
for all the Protestant confessions, and resolved to put such a plan into 
execution by means of a fixed tax on all the landowners belonging to 
them. This resolution was, however, never carried out, probably from 
’ the adverse circumstances of the Protestant denominations during the 
long reign of Sigismund III. The University of Kénigsberg might be 
considered in some respects as the Protestant school of highest order 
in Poland, at least as long as its founder, Duke Albert of Prussia, as 
Polish vassal, was guided by political and religious motives favorable 
to the Republic. Thus Kénigsberg, as well as the German and Dutch 
universities, was chiefly frequented by Polish Protestants who wished 
to receive that theological and other education which was necessary to 
qualify them for the office of Protestant ministers. They received, 
however, an education preparatory for those higher studies in prop- 
erly Polish schools, supported by the various churches and Reformed 
magnates, 
The most remarkable of those schools was that of Leszno, or Lissa, 
now in Prussian Poland, then the property of the illustrious family of 
Leszezynski. A member of that family, Raphael, having embraced 
Protestantism, gave the Roman Catholic church of Leszno to the Bohe- 
mian brethren (1550), and established there a school in 1555, which was 
much enlarged by his descendant, Andreas, palatine of Brest, in 
Kujawia, in 1604. From humble origins this school rose by the munifi- 
cence of its owner, Raphael, palatine of Belsk, to be one of very high 
order for the Helveto-Bohemian confession. ‘The city itself rose to a

high degree of prosperity by the immigration of many thousands of 
Protestants, who fled to Great Poland after the defeat of the “winter 
king” Frederick, palatine of the Rhine, at the battle of Weissenberg. 
Besides the ancient languages, universal history, geography, the Polish 
and German languages, mathematics, natural history, and other sciences 
were taught in that school, conducted by men of the highest learning, 
as Rybinski, Andreas Wengierski, the great naturalist Johnstone, and 
John Amos Comenius. 
The latter, perhaps the greatest educator of all times, born in 1592, 
at. Komna, in Moravia, whence he derived his name, driven out, as 
Protestant minister, from Bohemia and Moravia by the edict of 1624, 
finally settled at Leszno,in Poland. Having become professor of Latin 
and pastor of the Bohemian Church, he published, in 1631, his Janua 
Linguarum Reserata, i. e., The Gate of Languages Unloeked, which 
rapidly and deservedly gained for its author a prodigious reputation. 
Had Comenius only published this one book, Bayle rightly remarks, he 
would have immortalized himself and the Slavonie race. This work, 
translated into nearly all European languages, and. even into Arabie, 
‘Turkish, and Persian, was composed for the use of the schcol of Leszno, 
published in that town, thus connecting it with his immortal name. It 
is impossible to give even an outline of Comenius’s life and works here, 
but no educator should forego studying the masterly work of Kyaezala 
(now professor in the University of Dorpat) on Comenius, who was 
ealled by the Governments of Sweden and England, Transylvania and 
Holland, to reform their respective schools. After a residence of four 
years at the court of Sigismund Ragoezy, prince of Transylvania, he 
returned. to Leszno and superintended its school till the destruction of 
that city under the reign of John Casimir. He fled to Silesia, and after 
long wanderings through Germany sane settled at Amsterdam, where 
he died in 1671. 
The model school of Leszno was frequented by Protestant youths not 
only from every part of Poland but also from Prussia, Silesia, Moravia, 
Bohemia, and even Hungary. It justified its celebrity by an excellent 
organization and a continuous improvement of the methods of instrue- 
tion. Comenius opened a new road on that. important field, while the 
University of Cracow, the Jesuit colleges in Poland, and all the Catho- 
lic and Protestant schools in Germany and Poland alike lost themselves 
in the old scholastic methods of wasting the precious time of professors 
and. pupils. 
While the great Comenius improved the methods of education, nay, 
revolutionized them, Jam Johnstone, a Pole of Scotch descent, composed. 
for the same school his. Historia Universalis Civilis et Eeclesiastica, 
ete., ab orbe condito ad. 1633—Leyden, 1633. and 1638; Amsterdam, 1644; 
Frankfort, 1672—continued till that year, and many works on natural 
history, monumental for their time, making him “unsurpassed in learn- 
ing by any of his contemporaries.”
-P-A-G-E-797
HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 739 
Thus Leszno acquired a European reputation by its great men and 
its printing office, from which issued many important works in Polish, 
Bohemian, German, and Latin, and which was also provided with 
Greek and Hebrew types. But these literary establishments of Leszno 
were involved in the sad destruction of that town in 1656, 
But the Protestants of Grand Poland, assembled at the synod of 
Parcice, resolved to rebuild their old and famous school by subscrip- 
tion. It was really reopened. in 1663 and. a classieal seminary attached 
toit. Yet, owing to the fact that the family of Leszezynski had passed 
to the Roman Catholic Church, that a great part of its property was 
lost, and that the Protestant supporters of the town were generally 
ruined by war, it never attained its high standard again, although it 
has passed all the vicissitudes of the stirring history of the country, 
and exists to this very day, incorporated into and. leveled to the pres- 
ent admirable school system of Prussia in her provinee of Posen. 
The Bohemian brethren had also a higher school at Kozminek, 
established as early as 1553, which enjoyed for some time a great repu- 
tation. It dwindled down, however, toward the end of the sixteenth 
century, into a primary school, of which the Bohemian brethren pos- 
sessed several in Great Poland, as, for instance, at Poznania, Barcin, 
Ostrorog, Wieruszew, Lobeeniza, ete. The instruction given in such 
schools consisted, in addition to religion, of reading, writing, arithme- 
tic, and Polish grammar, the rudiments of Latin, and in some places of 
German. The Helvetian confession, which prevailed in Little Poland, 
had 14 higher sehools in that province, including the palatinates of 
Red Russia, Volhynia, and Podolia. The most celebrated of them were 
thoseof Dubiecko and Lubartow. The latter, established and supported 
by Firley, palatine of Cracow, enjoyed for some time an extraordinary 
popularity, and was frequented by many Catholic youths as well. But 
all these schools had only temporary prosperity, and were soon ruined 
by the want of permanent endowments, the voluntary contributions by 
which they were sustained diminishing or ceasing with the frequent 
conversion of their supporters to Catholicism. Thus the school of 
Paniowce, in Red Russia, founded by Jan Potocki, and apparently 
of some importance, since it had the privilege of an academy and pos- 
sessed a printing press, was abolished by Potocki’s son, who returned 
to the Catholie Church. As for primary schools, we may safely assume 
that every larger congregation had one. 
In Lithuania, too, there were quite a number of colleges belonging 
to the Helvetian Church, supported by the Protestant magnates of the 
Radziwills, who, although professing the Roman Catholic religion, 
continued to protect the foundations of their ancestors, and some of 
them last to this very day. 
But, on the whole, it may be asserted that this period also in the 
Reformed world of Poland was rather barren in regard to the highest 
education and learning. The many petty but harassing religious

antagonisms between the parties within the church itself hemmed the 
progress of the Catholic University of Cracow, whose students fre- 
quently indulged in excesses; the Jesuit colleges, and the Protestant 
schools likewise. Many of the best Poles, nobles and divines, had to 
obtain their education in foreign universities, and, as an indispensable 
preparation for their academical studies, they were taught foreign 
languages, to make the foreign literatures accessible to them. In this 
foreign education, which was brought about by the downfall of the 
Polish schools of higher order, lies at the same time the reason why 
these schools could not recover till about the middle of the eighteenth 
century. The suppression of the anti-Trinitarian or Socinian schools 
in Poland, especially that of Rakow, which was conducted by scholars, 
Poles as well as foreigners, who enjoyed a European reputation; that 
of Lubartow, which belonged to the wealthy magnate family of Kazi- 
mirski, and many others; the abolition of their printing offices, pro- 
hibiting their restoration under the penalty of civil death, and the 
banishment of the professors—all left a deep gap in the system of 
Polish schools of high order. 
Revival of higher cducation and downfall of Poland.—To Stanislas 
Konarski, a priest of the congregation of the Patres pii, belongs the 
high merit of reorganizing public instruction in Poland, of national- 
izing it after the denationalization brought about by the macaronic 
period, and of giving a new stimulus to Polish literature. He found 
worthy assistants in the bishops Joseph and Andreas Zaluski, who 
established at their own expense a public library of 200,000 volumes at 
Warsaw, which they made public in 1747. When Stanislas-Augustus 
Poniatowski ascened the throne in 1764, a general movement of renais- 
sance in Polish literature took place, which was zealously accelerated 
by the King. He also founded at Warsaw the “school of cadets,” the 
nucleus of the now fainous university. In order to encourage teachers 
anc students by his presence, he used to come to the examinations held 
at that school, and had a familiar intercourse with the professors, whose 
erudition aud works he liberally rewarded by the highest offices. After 
the suppression of the Jesuit order by papal decree, he employed their 
confiscated property and extensive estates to found and endow schools. 
Under his reign a commission of national education was established in 
1775 to administer and perfect public instruction. This institution 
was, according to Forster, the first supreme magistracy of the kind 
in Europe, which sustained the reformed universities of Cracow and 
Wilno and hundreds of new schools by the funds obtained from the 
estates of the Jesuits, who had been expelled from Poland after the 
suppression of the order by Pope Clemens XII. 
There is only one other State—namely, Prussia—which, after the 
destructive defeat of Jena and Auerstiidt in 1806 and the subsequent 
Joss of all her provinces on the left side of the Elbe, tried to compensate 
the material loss by an ideal gain, by the foundation of the University

  HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. TAL 
of Berlin in 1810. Just in the same way, Poland, after the first dis- 
memberment, in 1772, organized the said commission of education in 
1773! and made it a government institution in 1775. 
Of course the influence of the philosophy of the eighteenth century, 
the so-called period of enlightenment, and the progress in the system of 
teaching, the study of Montaigne, Komenski, Locke, Basedow, and Pes- 
talozzi, and the spread of the influence of the encyclopedists had every- 
where slowly created a sentiment in favor of good schools; in Poland, 
during the time of her misfortune, more than anywhere else the convic- 
tion took possession of many minds that good schools and higher edu- 
cation were necessary for the salvation of the country and for the moral 
and material progress of the nation. The King deemed it to be the 
duty of the Government to promote and aid schools of all grades for the 
promotion and extension of education, and the vice-chancellor of Lithu- 
ania, Joachim Chreptowicz, introduced a bill in the Polish diet of 1775 to 
make the commission of education a government institution. The act 
gave to the commission the exclusive right to control and govern all 
the Polish universities, colleges, academical colonies, and all the public 
schools. The commission was composed of the ablest men; among 
them were Andrew Zamoyski, Count Ignatius Potocki, Prince Adam 
Czartoryski, Prince Michael Poniatowski, bishop of Plock; Julian 
Niemcewiez, the famous poet; Gregor Poramowicz, Pater Kopezynski, 
and Pater Hugo Kollatai, the latter being the soul of the commission, 
an ableand aggressive statesman, a highly cultured and liberal-minded 
man, a democrat in the best sense of the word. The commission held 
semiweekly sessions. 
The country, so far as it was not annexed, was divided into six 
school districts. Each district had higher-grade and lower-grade col- 
leges. The universities of Cracow and Wilno were reformed, and a 
teachers’ seminary (normal college) added to each. Each district had 
inspectors of the schools and methods of teaching; libraries and 
museums were founded at the universities and colleges; gold and sil- 
ver medals were coined to stimulate industry by awarding them to the 
best scholars; talented young men, after graduating from the home 
schools, were sent to the western and southern European countries to 
perfect themselves still further and to acquire more knowledge about 
other nations, their institutions, customs, and character. 
The diet of 1793 extended the powers of the commission of educa- 
tion, and placed also the female institutes under its control. After 
the second partition the Government lost control of almost all its 
functions and the commission passed out of existence in 1794. 
  1In July, 1873, the hundredth anniversary of the commission of education was 
celebrated at Lemberg (Lwéw), capital of Galicia, Austria. In commemoration of 
that event the ‘charter of the commission of education” was reprinted in thou- 
sands of copies; it was to be the first volume of the ‘‘ Pedagogical Library” of 
Lwéw.

    742 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95, 
It is indeed. remarkable that Poland, in the short period of her pre- 
carious existence, 1775-1793, made far greater progress in learning and 
produced more works of merit than during the whole period that mac- 
aronism dominated publie education, a period which lasted nearly a 
century and a half. This progress of learning began also to exercise 
a most salutary effect on the state of the church in Poland, whieh had 
immensely suffered from the protracted. struggle between the Catholics 
and the Dissidents. 
But the Republic was doomed to annihilation. Yet, as if to illumi- 
nate its. downfall, one of the most fruitful periods of scientific and 
literary elevation set in,’ accompanying the restoration of schools, high 
and low. Krasieki (1735-1801) was surnamed. the prince of poets. 
His. immense genius excelled in the most varied fields of poetry. His 
Myszeis (mysz, mouse; Myomachia) is. a mock-heroie poem, consecrated 
to the war of King Popiel” against the mice of his kingdom. The eddi- 
ties of the court of King Popiel and. the quarrels, strifes, and. intrigues 
of the mice are ingeniously and bitterly sareastie allusions to the court 
and Polish nation of the time. It is in its kind—comparable to Sebas- 
tian Brant’s, Narrenschiff and. Rabelais’s satirie works—one of the best 
mock-heroie epies. and the finest monument of Polish literature in the 
eighteenth century. His fables, too, are one of the master works of 
Polish literature. Niemcewiez is especially famous by his historic 
songs, which have been set to musie by the Polish composers. Numer- 
ous. other great. literary men, like the historians: Naruszewiez, Kra- 
jewski, Jezierski, etc., the jurists. Skrzetuski and Ostrowski, the 
publicist Hugh Kollataj, etc., glorified the politieal downfall of the 
country. Stanislaus Staszic, born in 1755, a genuine patriot, after 
the establishment of the short living Congresspoland, at the Congress 
of Vienna, was named minister of public instruction, im which position 
he improved the existing schools and. established new ones, and raised 
the University of Warsaw to a much more important position. Healso 
founded an institute for the deaf and dumb and a. schoel of engineer- 
ing, thus laying the corner stone for the later developed schools of 
technology in Russia. It is his merit. to have advanced the intel- 
lectual condition of the country in its, political decline. 
Another patriot, who devoted himself to the education of the Polish 
1Jt is difficult to see how Morfill' can find the period of Krasicki and Niemcewicz 
and the literature which the political decay of the eighteenth century produced as 
“harmonizing with its: decadence.” This statement is as unwarranted as to call 
Krasicki a. ‘‘ Polish embodiment of a French abbé;” “his: epic on the war of Cho- 
cim no epic at.all;” “his lighter pieces and mock heroics as pleasing.” 
*Tho legend of King Popiel, very similar to that of Bishop Hatto (cf. the mice 
tower on the Rhine), goes as follows: ‘King Popiel was a vicious man, and had 
become so hateful to the nation that a conspiracy, headed by his uncles, was entered 
into against him. He treacherously poisoned his enemies and left their bodies to 
the beasts of the fields. But numberless rats sprang from their bodies and consumed 
the king and his family.”

nation, raised the Academy of Cracow to a high standard, bringing 
about a great progress in the education of the country, was Hugh 
Kollataj. But his efforts to remedy the political evils of the country 
were thwarted by the blindness of his opponents. 
Thus all the brilliancy of the period in literature, history, and edu- 
eation served only to illuminate the end of Poland. . From this time on 
education in Poland has to go through all the phases and political 
changes of the three countries of which she forms integral parts. 
HIGHER EDUCATION OF RUSSIAN POLAND. 
On April 25, 1795, Stanislaus Poniatowski resigned the crown of 
Poland at Grodno, and therewith the history of the country under Rus- 
sian, Austrian, and Prussian rule begins. Emperor Paul treated his 
Polish subjects with great regard and kindness. His successor, the 
romantic Emperor Alexander I, also allowed, to a large extent, self- 
administration and the use of the native language, and in 1803 con- 
ferred great privileges upon the University of Wilno. 
The crushing defeat of Prussia by Napoleon and the inglorious Tilsit 
treaty brought to a part of Poland once more a shadow of independ- 
ence. By virtue of Article V of that treaty the duchy of Warsaw was 
created in 1807 under the Elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus. It 
was composed of almost all the Polish provinces taken from Poland by 
Prussia in 1772, 1793, and 1795; it had about 2,200,000 inhabitants and 
an area of about 101,500 square kilometers, embracing six departments— 
Posen, Kalisz, Plock, Warsaw, Lomza, Bydgoszez (Bromberg). In 
consequence of Napoleon’s war of 1809 against Austria, in which the 
duchy participated, the latter was increased by all the land between the 
Vistula, Bug, and Pilitza, i. e., Cracow, Sandomir, Lublin, and other 
cities and territories. ° 
This establishment of a national government in the new duchy of 
Warsaw had a favorable influence upon public instruction. The com- 
mission of education was resurrected, and Count Stanislaus Potocki 
placed at its head. The name was changed first to “chamber of public 
education,” then to “directory of public edueation,” and after the erea- 
tion of the “congressional Kingdom of Poland,” under Russian gov- 
ernment, to “commission of enlightenment.” Warsaw was endowed 
with a law school (1808), to which was added in 1811 a school of ad- 
ministrative sciences and a school of medicine. Each province of the 
duchy was to receive a district college, every village its primary school. 
But the invasion into Poland of the confederate armies in 1813 made 
an end to the attempted reforms. Still the literary movement and the 
ascendency of public instruction went on; historians like Lelewel and 
Albertrandy flourished, numerous literary societies were formed, and 
the cities and academies rivaled in preeminence as to certain branches. 
Thus the school of Krzemieniec was superior to that of Warsaw in 
poetry; Wilno excelled by its school of medicine; while in Warsaw the
-P-A-G-E-802
    744 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Society of the Friends of Sciences contributed very much to encourag- 
ing and developing the literary movement. Mickiewicz planted the 
standard of romanticism in Poland; he is the Polish Victor Hugo. His 
Konrad Wallenréd (1828) and Malezeski’s Maria, a song of the Ukraine 
(1826), are pearls of epic and lyric poetry unsurpassed in any literature. 
Thus the intellectual progress of the Russian part of Poland ever 
went on and the political dependence did not weigh too heavily upon 
the country. Russian Poland was to form a constitutional kingdom 
allied to Russia by personal union, somewhat like Sweden-Norway. 
The constitution allowed the country was even too liberal, as compared 
with autocratie Russia, to last very long. Poland was to be governed 
by responsible ministers, a senate, and a legislative chamber. A national 
army under the national White Eagle, a separate budget, a free press, 
and personal liberty, as well as the free use of the Polish language in 
private and official life were guaranteed; but this good will would and 
could not last. In 1819 the anti-Russian movement, which steadily 
increased, made a censorship of the press necessary, contrary to the 
terms of the constitution; some of the students of the universities of 
Wilno and Warsaw were imprisoned and tried for high treason.’ At 
last the University of Warsaw and a great number of schools and 
private institutions of learning were suppressed by ukase of November 
9, 1831, and the school of cadets at Kalisz by ukase of January, 1832. 
An ukase of February 15, 1832, decreed that the library of 150,000 
volumes, engravings, and the cabinet of numismatics should be trans- 
ferred from the University of Warsaw to St. Petersburg. The ukase 
of February 26, 1832, known by the name of “organic statute,” destroyed 
all the stipulations of the Vienna treaty and declared “ Poland is an 
integral part of the Russian Empire; its inhabitants must in the future 
form with the Russians but one and the same nation. The ministry of 
public instruction is abolished.” All educational institutions of Poland 
were placed under the control of the department of the Interior in St. 
Petersburg. Here the school system of Poland begins to become abso- 
Jutely Russianized in form, spirit, and contents; and it can not be said 
that, in spite of many hardships, the efforts of the Russian Government 
were unwise, impracticable, though hostile to the Polish education of 
the Polish nation. 
In place of the closed university a “general college” was opened 
for the purpose of teaching law and classics. The nobility and bureau- 
cracy had separate philological provincial colleges, while the other 
classes (“le tiers état”) were educated in the so-called ‘‘real-gymnasia” 
with a more technical training. According to the ukase of Czar 
1In 1830 Warsaw had the following higher educational institutions: The university 
with about 600 students; three classical gymnasia (lycea); one polytechnic school, 
founded in 1825; one agricultural college, founded in 1816; one school of forestry, 
founded in 1816; one musical conservatory; four seminaries; three female high 
schools with 830 pupils.       
  
  
  
-P-A-G-E-803
HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 745 
Nicolaus I in 1840 the purposes of education in Poland were to arouse 
the love of religion and monarchical government and the acquisition 
of special technical knowledge. 
Mr. W. A. Day in his Russian Government in Poland (Longman, 
Green & Co., London, 1867), the best and most impartial book on the 
_ subject, based on the best and most reliable Russian sources, speaks 
about the educational events of that epoch in substance in the follow- 
ing way: , 
Warsaw and Wilno were the seats of two universities, where men of 
the Polish race had long been educated; they possessed libraries and 
collections, the relics of old times, the memorials of an age when Coper- 
nicus taught and Sobieski ruled. These institutions were regarded by 
the Emperor as memorials of that past which it was his mission to crush 
out. Ifhe suppressed them, he thought he would destroy two of the 
rallying points of disaffection and revolt, so his mandate went forth, 
and the universities were closed. 
The libraries and collections they had contained were transferred to 
St. Petersburg and Kief, and Poland and the western provinces were 
deprived of their accustomed means of education. No longer possessing 
them in their own neighborhood, the nobles of the Kingdom were com- 
pelled to send their sons to the distant universities of Kief, Moscow, . 
and St. Petersburg. Some of the poor students, who were unable to 
afford the cost of an education, were supported at these universities 
on condition that after leaving it they should pass several years in the 
public service. Thus, far away from their own land, the Emperor 
anticipated that they would forget the misfortunes of their country, 
that they would cease to look back on its past history with vain repin- 
ing, and that they would devote all their energies to the service of the 
Empire. 
The result did not answer his expectations; in many instances it 
prevented the poorer proprietors from affording a liberal education to 
their sons, and frequently the wealthier classes refused to part with 
their children, as they objected to the long and remote separation ren- 
dered necessary by their distance from the Russian universities. And 
the wealthier proprietors were unwilling that their sons should enter 
the public service and they therefore sent them very frequently to some 
German university to receive their education, and left them to gather 
it as best they could in the course of foreign travel. 
Education was thus in & measure checked by this act of power, but 
nevertheless large numbers of Polish students went to the principal 
Russian universities, where, instead of losing their nationality, it became 
more than ever confirmed. 
Sometimes in periods of political excitement they banded themselves 
together as a distinct and separate body, neither sharing in the sports 
nor sympathizing in the pursuits of the other students. Thus, in the 
university cf St. Petersburg they formed one-third of the whole body 
ED 95 24%  
-P-A-G-E-804
  746 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of students, and in that of Kief they were comparatively even more 
numerous; in the former they partially and in the latter they altogether 
refused to associate themselves with the Russians. Oftener, however, 
they took the lead in daring political speculations, supported the most 
advanced liberal theories, and endeavored there to prejudice their Rus- 
sian fellow-students against all the forms of an autocratic Government. _ 
The policy of the Emperor Nicolaus on the subject of education 
was consistent with the measures adopted in other branches of the 
administration. 
The study of the ancient history of Poland was forbidden or per- 
mitted only in the feeble or garbled treatises of Russian scribes, as 
though every battlefield had not its memory, as though every tomb in 
the churches, every banner that moldered on their sacred walls, did not 
teach some passage of her history. The works of foreign authors were 
rigorously forbidden, and secret commissions punished their study with 
imprisonment and exile. The visits of foreigners were as much as pos- 
sible discouraged, and they were subjected to numberless vexatious 
restrictions, having their speedy departure for their object. 
The process of Russification was inaugurated with great skill and 
executive talent, however painful the systematic policy of destroying 
_an old, historic, and. rich civilization might be to the Pole or any other 
nationalist. 
The first act of that process was an act of charity. The poor Polish 
orphans and waifs, whose parents had perished during the bloody rey- 
olution of 1830 or had been deported, were taken under Russian care 
and protection to be educated in order to become useful Russian soldiers. 
On the 24th of March, 1832, Prince Paskewitsh issued the following 
order: : 
It has pleased His Majesty the Emperor that all abandoned male children, orphans, 
or paupers in Poland. be incorporated into the cantonal bataillons, and that accord- 
ingly they be taken in a body (enlevés en masse) and sent to Mifisk, where they will 
be disposed of according to the regulations of the generality of His Majesty. 
Also the children of the Polish schools of charity, the orphans of the 
Child Jesus, were taken care of by the Russian administration. An 
ukase of June, 1832, prohibited the use of the Polish language before 
those tribunals of Russian Poland which lay outside the Kingdom 
proper. 
The 15th of August Pope Gregory XVI addressed an encyclical to 
the bishops of Poland (alike in spirit to a recent encyclical of Leo XIII 
to the Polish bishops in Russia) to submit themselves to their magnani- 
mous Emperor Nicolaus I as their legitimate sovereign. An ukase of 
June, 1838, prescribes that history and the exact sciences be taught in 
the Gymnasia (Lycea) in Russian. By virtue of decrees rendered in 
1843 and 1845 in regard to the public instruction in Poland, superior 
and secondary instruction were limited to the technical sciences. To 
pursue the courses of classical and. philosophical instruction the Polish

youths must betake themselves to the Russian universities proper. The 
communes were authorized to abolish old and incompetent schools 
according to their best judgment; thus 239 primary schools were closed 
in the decade of 1845-1855. The revolutionary movement in 1846-1848 
forced the Russian Government to new measures of restriction. But 
a new stimulus was given to the cause of education when the noble 
Emperor Alexander IT, in 1856, appointed Marquis Wielopolski minister 
of civil government of Poland. 
At the accession of Alexander IT to the throne, education in Poland 
was.at a very low ebb. The suppression of the University of Warsaw 
left no establishment in the Kingdom where a superior education could 
be procured. In all the Kingdom there were only eight gymnasia or 
institutes for nobles where a secondary education was given, and by 
law the professors in these institutions were obliged to teach the 
sciences in the Russian language, though practically this enactment 
was not always observed, for it was difficult to find professors who 
could speak Russian, and still more difficult to find scholars to eompre- 
hend them. 
The elementary public instruction was in a better condition. The 
number of elementary schools was 1,000, and there were 20 district and 
“real” schools. Yet even under these improved conditions, in 1860 
only 137,417 persons (28 per 1,000) in Poland had obtained a superior 
education; 825,470 (170 per 1,000) could write and read; 3,877,579 (802 
per 1,000), or more than four-fifths, of the population, could neither 
write nor read. 
In 1857 the Government had taken the first step toward the estab- 
lishment of a university in Warsaw by endowing a faculty or academy 
of medicine there. A further step was taken in 1861, when the Emperor 
directed the commission of public instruction to elaborate a project of 
law in order thoroughly to reform the organization of public instrue- 
tion in the Kingdom. The aim of this scheme was to enable men of 
every religion and condition to study special sciences there, and allow 
the common people to acquire all elementary knowledge necessary for 
them. 
The law consequently elaborated was sanctioned by the Emperor, 
and put in force from March 20, 1862, and consisted chiefly of the fol- 
lowing particulars: 
Catholic priests and proprieters of towns and villages were allowed 
to found, at their own expense or at that of the place where they were 
established, elementary schools for teaching the Catholic religion, read- 
ing and writing in the Polish language, and arithmetic, and they could 
appoint as masters of such schools all indiyiduals having the qualifica- 
tions required by law for enabling them to take such office. In addition 
to these, one or more elementary schools were to be founded in each 
commune at the expense of the Government; these schools were to 
be placed under the surveillance of the Catholic priests and certain

  748 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
inhabitants of the commune, elected by the commune itself, and to be 
subject to their inspection and local administration. 
The district schools were to be divided into “general” schools for 
general instruction; ‘training” schools for preparing masters for ele- 
mentary schools, and special or ‘real schools” for teaching agriculture, 
trade, and other special subjects. 
In addition to the 7 existing gymnasia, 6 more were directed to be 
added, and instead of the Institute of Nobles a lyceum was founded 
as an establishment where a supplementary or superior class to those 
existing in the gymnasia might be taught. The scholars might belong 
to any religious denomination, and the cost of instruction was only 16 
rubles a year. 
A polytechnic institute was founded in Pulova, and the plan of the 
University of Warsaw was sketched out. It was to be composed of 
four faculties—medicine; philosophy, or phyics and mathematics; juris- 
prudence; history and philology. To the university two seminaries 
were to be attached for preparing masters for gymnasia and district 
schools. The polytechnic institute was to be composed of five sections— 
mechanics, civil engineering, mining, agriculture, and forestry. Stu- 
dents of all religious persuasions were admitted to the university, and 
the cost of instruction was only 20 rubles a year. 
The national language, history, and literature were to be taught in 
all the schools; the Polish language was alone employed in giving 
instruction, and the Russian language was only taught in the superior 
and secondary schools. 
Such were the institutions founded in consequence of the decree of 
March 14, 1861, by the noble and liberal-minded Emperor Alexander 
II, and his right hand in Poland, Wielopolski. These institutions were 
intended to pave the way to others of a yet more liberal and national 
tendency, and to the eventual introduction of a system of constitutional 
government in Poland, for extended education is the surest preparation 
for the responsibilities of power. 
But the insurrection of 1863 stopped the beautiful free development 
of a national educationin Poland. Yet even under these changed con- 
ditions, the fruits of the educational movement were not lost, although 
‘partly lost, to Polish nationalism. 
Marquis Wielopolski, although animated by sincere patriotism, with 
great knowledge of his country and the wishes of his countrymen, was 
nevertheless probably the most unpopular man in Poland. Yet his 
merits in the improvement of education in Poland were extraordinary. 
Under him the schools were reorganized and rapidly increased. The 
university was partly reestablished in 1861 under the name of “ Prin- 
cipal School,” in 1862 the Marymont Institute was changed into the 
Polytechnic Institute, and in 1869 the former was raised to the standard 
of the other Russian universities, all instruction being, however, unfor- 
tunately conducted in the official Russian language.

The new University of Warsaw.—On June 8, 1869, an imperial ukase 
was issued to the Ruling Senate (Pravitelst vuyuschiy Senat), reading 
as follows: 
Having recognized the advantages of erecting in the place of the now existing 
Principal School at Warsaw an imperial university, enlarging it in accordance with 
the local conditions and the legislation on the basis of which the other universities 
are constructed, we authorize the drawing up, by the minister of public instruction 
and in the committee for the affairs of the Tsarstvo of Poland, the plans for the 
establishment and the statutes for the University of Warsaw, and transmitting them 
to the Ruling Senate, we decree that— 
(1) On the basis of these plans and regulations there be established in place of the 
Principal School at Warsaw at the beginning of the ensuing academic year 1869-70 
the Imperial University of Warsaw. 
(2) For the support of this university there be turned over the sum of 132,100 
rubles, which is at present given for the maintenance of the Principal School, and 
the remaining sum of 79,680 rubles, needed for the budget of the university, shall be 
added from the imperial treasury. 
(3) The balance necessary for the maintenance of the university in this current 
year of 1869 in consequence of the change of its status shall be entered into the 
accounts of expense of the ministry of public instruction. 
In the following year (1870) the total of 211,718 rubles required shall be put under 
the proper heading in the financial accounts of the ministry of public instruction. 
(4) All the plans for the construction of the university in place of the Principal 
School at Warsaw shall be submitted to the minister of public instruction. 
The Ruling Senate shall not cease to work for the completion of the proper plans. 
ALEXANDER II. 
TSARSKOE SELO, June 8, 1869. 
The University of Warsaw, like all the Russian universities, belongs, 
according to Friedrich Paulsen, to the German type of university, which 
also includes Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. 
The word of J. Delyanoff, Russian minister of public instruction, will 
be unassailable: 
We endeavor in everything that concerns educational affairs to accept Germany as 
a model, and this is very good. Our universities are established after the German 
type. Germany is the country of higher civilization; its universities stand on a 
considerable height. 
A commission of all the curators of the Russian universities and 7 
professors, under the chairmanship of the curator of Dorpat, George 
von Bradke, in 1862 undertook the modification and advancement of 
the law of 1835 concerning the universities, not its change. In 1863 
the “improved” bill of that commission became law under the minister 
of public instruction, A. Golownin, who deemed it essential and neces- 
sary to make the autonomy of the universities the basis of the law. 
It consequently transferred the direct administration of the universities 
to the rector and the academic council, “which shall decide all the 
affairs either definitely or subject to the confirmation by the curator of 
the university. The academic council is the center of the internal 
administration, the highest resort, to which all the other organs are 
subjected.”
-P-A-G-E-808
  750 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Briefly, all this meant self-government of the universities, to the 
exclusion of the State and governmental power. 
Golownin’s successor, Count D. Tolstoi (1866-1880), soon recognized 
the necessity of organic changes. The attitude of the students; their 
excesses of a political nature; disturbances, especially among those of 
the university, the medico-surgical academy, and the school of tech- 
nology at St. Petersburg, forced the minister to fix their position legally 
in harmony with the other higher organs of the State power (1867); 
collisions in the academic council brought about instructions in regard 
to the duties and rights of the rector (1868); extremely undesirable 
results at the reelection of professors, who needed a majority of two- 
thirds of all the votes of the academic council, caused the abolition of 
this arrangement. 
It was just at this critical juncture that the University of Warsaw 
was established with the old principal school as its nucleus, and it was 
but natural that it should receive regulations of its own, especially 
adapted to the necessities, from a Russian standpoint, of a university 
of the Tsarstvo of Poland. The other Russian universities received 
their general statute only in 1884, which decisively transferred the act- 
ing power from the academic council and the faculties to the organs of 
the State, the curator, the inspector, a’kind of police supervisor, and 
the rector. 3 
The constitution of the University of Warsaw.—The constitution of the 
university is given in 11 chapters and 138 sections,! of which it may be 
desirable to make the following brief extracts: 
The University of Warsaw consists of the 4 faculties, the historico- 
philological, the physico-mathematical, the legal, and the medical fac- 
ulties. It is under the supreme supervision of the minister of public 
instruction and belongs to the circuit of the curator of Warsaw. He 
supervises the relations of the university with the minister. and the 
supreme imperial power, decides questions which are not reserved to 
the minister, and has especially to maintain order and discipline within 
the university. The immediate administration of the same belongs to 
the rector, the academic council, the directors, and the faculties. 
The Russian language is obligatory in conducting all instruction as 
well as in all official documents of the university. 
The rector is nominated by the minister of public instruction from 
among the full professors and confirmed by the Emperor. He has the 
immediate administration of the university and is superior to the officers 
of the same. The academic council, in which all full and associate 
professors, under the chairmanship of the rector, have a seat and vote, 
bestows, at the request of the respective faculties, academic dignities, 
and has an advisory power with the curator or the minister in the 
affairs of instruction and inner administration of the university.

As to the general features of the Russian universities, their institu- 
tions, reforms, administration, I may safely refer the reader to the Report 
of. the Commissioner of Education, 1890-91, pp. 195-242, prepared by 
Miss Frances Graham French. : 
The constitution of the universities at St. Petersburg, Moscow, Khar- 
kov (Charkow), Kazan, Kief, Odessa, is established by the imperial 
universal statute of August 23, 1884, and by a great number.of reg- 
ulations issued by the minister of public instruction. The University 
of Helsingfors (Finland) has its own statutes of 1852. The Uni- 
versity of Tomsk has so far only a medical faculty, though the other 
faculties are now in preparation. The statutes of the old German Uni- 
versity of Dorpat (Jurjew) and the formerly Polish University of War- 
saw do not differ very much from the universal statute except in several 
incisive points, especially adapted to thé purpose of making them 
centers of Russian learning par excellence. The university of Warsaw 
under the present curator, Apuchtin, is the center of the educational 
district of Warsaw, which is one of the 14 educational districts into 
which the Empire is divided (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, Oren- 
burg, Charkow, Odessa, Kief, Wilno, Warsaw, Dorpat, Caucasus, 
Turkestan, West Siberia, and East Siberia). According to the original 
plan of this division during the reign of Alexander I, at the head of 
each district a university was to stand, but it is wanting as yet in the 
districts of Wilno, Orenburg, Caucasus, East Siberia, and Turkestan. 
All the universities, and in fact most of the schools, of the Empire are 
under the ministry of public instruction; only certain special schools 
are under separate ministers. The total contribution for education from 
the various ministries was 43,884,534 rubles in the budget for 1893. 
The board of directors, which consists of the deans of the four fac- 
ulties and the inspector, is charged with the economic administration, 
and exercises a judiciary power over the students. The disciplinary 
power is, first of all, in the hands of the inspector, a police officer with- 
out scholarly qualification, who, at the proposal of the curator, is 
nominated by the minister, and, although dependent on the rector in 
his activity, reports not directly to the rector but to the curator. With 
his assistants and servants and with the secretary for the affairs of 
the students he has to watch over the conduct of the students within 
the university buildings and, so far as possible, also outside of them. 
If the good order or good morals are disturbed in the university he 
has to employ proper measures to restore order. 
The university has the right to import books from abroad without 
censorship as wellas the right to publish books without preventive 
censorship upon the responsibility of the faculties. Each faculty eon- 
sists of the dean, the full and associate professors, the docenten, and 
the lectors. The deans are elected at the meetings of their faculties 
from the number of the full professors for three years, and, if there 
are less than 3 such professors in the faculty, also from the number
-P-A-G-E-810
  752 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of the [extraordinary] associate professors. They must be confirmed 
by the minister of public instruction. 
The historico-philological faculty of the University of Warsaw was 
originally established with 11 professors and 6 docenten. 
The instruction in the Polish language as well as in the other mod- 
ern foreign languages may be given by lecturers in their native tongue. 
The following studies were to be obligatory: (1) Philosophy, (a) logic, 
(b) psychology, (¢) history of philosophy; (2) Greek, (a) Greek language 
and interpretation of authors, (b) history of Greek literature, (c) Greek 
antiquities; (3) Latin (divisions like Greek); (4) grammar of the Sla- 
vonic languages; (5) Russian and the other Slavonic languages and 
the history of Russian literature; (6) history of general literature; (7) 
Slavonie philology, (a) Slavonic languages—Polish, Czech, Servian, 
etc.; (b) Slavonic antiquities; (8) general history; (9) Russian history. 
In the physico-mathematical faculty the academic chairs were origi- 
nally distributed among 10 professors and 5 docenten: (1) Pure mathe- 
maties; (2) mechanics (a) analytical, (b) practical; (3) astronomy and 
geodesy; (4) physics; (5) chemistry, (a) applied, (b) theoretical; (6) 
physical geography; (7) botany, (a) morphology of plants, (b) anatomy 
and physiology of plants; (8) mineralogy, geognosy, and paleontology ; 
(9) zoology, (a) anatomy and systematics of animals, ()) anatomy of 
men and physiology of animals; (10) technical chemistry; (11) agronom- 
ical chemistry. 
The law faculty was to have 10 professors and 3 docenten: (1) 
Encyclopedia of law, (+) encyclopedia of the legal and political sci- 
ences, ()) the history of the philosophy of law; (2) history of Russian 
law; (3) history of the Slavonic legislations, with a view to the other 
ancient and modern legislations; (4) Roman law, (a) history of the 
Roman law, (6) dogmatics of the Roman civil law, (c) Byzantine law; 
(5) public law, (a) theory of public law, (b) public law of the various 
foreign states, (¢) Russian public law; (6) civil law and theory of plead- 
ing; (7) penal law and procedure; (8) police law; (9) finance law, (@) 
theory of finances, (b) Russian finance law; (10) international law; (11) 
political economy and statistics. 
The medical faculty was to consist of 16 professors, 10 docenten, and 
3 demonstrators (prosectors), and was to be provided with the neces- 
sary clinics and laboratories. One lector, for Russian, German, 
French, English, and Italian, respectively, was to be appointed. 
As to the academic degrees, conditions, and appointments of the docen- 
ten and professors at the University of Warsaw, there is no difference 
from the other Russian universities. I can therefore refer to the Report 
of the Commissioner of Education, 1890-91, pages 237 to 242. As to sal- 
aries, they were fixed in the imperial ukase of 1869 at 5,000 rubles for the 
rector, 3,000 rubles for the full professors and the inspector, 2,000 rubles 
for the associate professors, 1,200 rubles for the docenten and demonstra- 
tors, 2,000 rubles for the lector in Russian, and 800 rubles for the lectors 
   
-P-A-G-E-811
HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 753 
in the other modern languages. For the cabinets and laboratories 
7,650 rubles were appropriated; for the clinics, 8,000 rubles; for the 
edition of the university journals and gazettes, 800 rubles. 
The matriculation of male students only, connected with many for- 
malities, can take place only at the beginning of the winter semester 
in the case of such young men as are in possession of a certificate of 
maturity from a regular gymnasium under the supervision of the min- 
ister of public instruction. In the historico-philological and physico- 
mathematical faculties of the University of Warsaw only pupils of the 
religious seminaries, after passing an entrance examination, can be 
matriculated, Also, other friendly disposed persons besides the students 
can, under certain conditions, be admitted to the courses. Passing over 
from one Russian university to another: can take place only with the 
permission of the board of directors of the latter institution. When 
applying for admittance, the student has, with his other certificates, to 
file his photograph with his own signature. He has to procure from 
the inspector every semester a new passport and entrance card to the 
university. The student pays to the university 50 rubles per semester 
(in the other Russian universities, 25 rubles) and a fee of 1 ruble per 
weekly hour for the semester (about 15 to 20 rubles). There is, how- 
ever, an extraordinary liberality in remitting these fees, and even in 
granting scholarships, to needy but worthy students. These scholar- 
ships (stipendia) mostly enjoin the obligation upon the student of remain- 
ing in the State service for a certain number of years after graduation. 
Students’ societies, deputations, collective petitions, and addresses are 
forbidden. The punishments that can be inflicted upon students are 
like those in the German universities—admonition, prison (in the so- 
called “carcer”), removal from the university (consilium abeundi), and 
relegation without the right of passing over to another Russian 
university. 
The complete academic course comprises, for medical students, 10 
semesters; for those of the other faculties, 8 semesters. Controlling 
examinations take place at the end of every semester. After completing 
his course, the student may obtain scholarships for two or three years, 
in order to prepare himself for the higher degrees. The requirements 
of scholarship and attainments are minutely described in the regula- 
tions, confirmed by the minister of public instruction. The final medi- 
cal examination presupposes a preliminary examination in natural 
sciences after 4 semesters (like the tentamen physicum in Germany). 
There are two academic degrees—that of magister and of doctor—which 
are a necessary preliminary for obtaining a professorship in a Russian 
“university. 
To the original regulations of June 8, 1869, eleven appendixes (prilo- 
shenia) were added, to extend and improve the teaching and adminis- 
trating power of the university. These additional decrees were pro- 
mulgated by the minister of public instruction or the curators of the 
Warsaw circuit of education from March 18, 1881, to December 27, 1891.
-P-A-G-E-812
  754 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The need of a thorough Polish literary education having been strongly 
felt, it was at last decided by the committee on Polish affairs to leave it 
with the minister of public instruction to appoint a professor for Polish 
literature at a salary of 3,000 rubles. The Emperor having given his 
consent on January 12, 1882, it was reported by the curator on Febru- 
ary 1, 1882. 
The regulations concerning the rights of the rector as chairman of 
the academic council were fixed, the payment of fees by the students 
arranged, the university library provided with librarians and assist- 
ants, the astronomical observatory and meteorological station estab- 
lished, the numismatic cabinet and the museum of antiquities founded: 
briefly, the university put in working order in every respect.

  Report of the rector (1893-94).—The University of Warsaw is com- 
posed of four faculties, the historico-philological, the physico-mathemat- 
ical, the law, and medical faculties, like the other Russian universities, 
excepting St. Peterburg and Odessa, which have no medical faculties; 
but the former has, beside the historico-philological, a most admirable 
oriental faculty. 
The work done during the academic year 1893-94 shows that the 
University of Warsaw is a real universitas litterarum, not inferior to 
any European school of equal grade in the scope of instruction. 
The historico-philological faculty.—This faculty consists of three great 
departments, the classical, Slavonic-Russian, and historical depart- 
ments. 
The principal studies are analogous to those of most of the other 
European universities here specially adapted to the needs of Polish 
students who are to be amalgamated to Russian professional, scientific, 
and literary life. The time to be devoted to study in this faculty 
embraces four years. 
In philosophy there is at present only one chair, to which falls the 
instruction in psychology, logic, ancient and modern philosophy. 
In the Greek language and literature, Greek dialectology, Euripides, 
Thucydides, as well as translation from Russian into Greek, is con- 
ducted by the head professor; the history of Greek literature, an 
introduction into Aristophanes, translation from Latin into Greek, 
interpretation of the orator Aischines is conducted by the associate 
professor of Greek. 
The Latin department, conducted by 2 professors, embraces studies 
in literature, criticism, and hermeneutics in Tacitus, Juvenal, Martial, 
Cicero’s philosophical works, and seminary practice. 
Comparative studies of the Indo-European languages, their phonetics 
and morphology, and Sanscrit proper are taught by 1 professor ordi- 
narius. 
Russian and the other Slavonic tongues are taught by 2 professors 
and 1 lecturer, viz, Panslavic grammar, history of Russian literature 
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Russian grammar. 
The history of Western-European literature is represented by 1 asso- 
ciate professor, who lectures on the epic poetry of western Europe and 
modern Greek literature.
-P-A-G-E-815
HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 757 
Slavonic philology and antiquities are represented by 3 professors 
and 1 docent, embracing the history of Polish literature, Slavonic liter- 
ature, and archeology at large, characteristics of the Slavonic races, 
ethnology, grammar of the Czech and Lusatian tongues. 
Western European history, represented by 2 professors, who teach 
Greek history, German history in the nineteenth century, history of the 
Middle Ages, diplomatics and chronology, and practical exercises on 
the history of the Middle Ages. 
Russian history, in the hands of 2 professors, treats of the reign of 
Alexander I and the modern period of Russian history, its ancient 
period, and the history of Western Russia. 
The two principal Teutonic and the romance languages—German and. 
English, French and Italian—are each represented by 1 poorly paid 
lecturer, generally a foreigner. In these departments lies the weak- 
ness not only of the University of Warsaw, but of all Russian univer- 
sities, that of St. Petersburg not excluded. Instruction in modern 
languages amounts to mere “‘Sprachmeisterei.” There is not even a 
beginning of modern philology and critical literature in a university 
sense, and the contrast with the other highly developed branches of 
learning is so much the more striking. 
The physico-mathematical faculty.—This faculty is admirably fitted 
out with professors and apparatus. AJl the branches taught in the 
best universities are here well represented in 22 departments, embrac- 
ing astronomy, geodesy, botany, mineralogy, and crystallography; 
general, special, and technical chemistry; experimental physics, zool- 
ogy, geology, and paleontology; pure and applied mathematics, math- 
ematical physics, physical geography, comparative anatomy, and 
histology; mechanics and heavenly mechanics. 
The law faculty—tThis consists of 14 principal departments, under 
12 professors, beside the 2 departments of legal medicine and psychia- 
try. The students of law are obliged, for their general education, to 
attend during their first year the lectures in the historico-philological 
faculty on the Russian language, ancient Russian history, history of 
ancient philosophy and logic, history of the Middle Ages; during 
their.second course, the lectures on modern Russian history, the his- 
tory of modern philosophy and psychology, as well as the French or 
German language. This rule is exceedingly beneficial for the eleva- 
tion of the juridic faculty and worthy of imitation with us, especially 
as no finished college education is required for entrance to most of our 
American law schools, as is required for entrance to the Russian 
juridical schools. 
The principal departments in the Warsaw law faculty are the follow- 
ing: Encyclopedia of law and the history of Slavonic legislation; legal 
and political sciences; history of Russian law; Roman law and Byzan- 
tine law; political law, civil law, civil procedure, penal law, criminal 
procedure, police law, law on economics and finances, international 
law, statistics, commercial law.

  758 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The medical faculty—As to completeness of studies, equipment of 
laboratories, clinics, and hospitals, this faculty ranks among the very 
best of Europe. It is older than the university, having been founded 
in 1857 as the Medico-Surgical Academy at Warsaw. It contains 29 
full departments of medicine and its auxiliary sciences. The Russian 
language, its phonetics, morphology, and syntax, is continued with the 
students of medicine during their first professional course. The phar- 
maceutical students, too, are bound to take certain courses in Russian. 
There are 24 professors (professors ordinary), 2 associate professors 
(professor extraordinary), 3 demonstrators (prosectors), 4 docenten, 1 
lecturer in Russian in the faculty. The studies, distributed over a cur- 
riculum of four years, are descriptive anatomy; histology, embryology, 
and comparative anatomy; physiology; medical chemistry; pharmacy 
and pharmacognocy; pharmacology and prescriptions; pathological 
anatomy; general pathology; materia medica and therapeuties; thera- 
peutical clinic; theoretical surgery; hygiene and medical police; dis- 
eases of women and children; forensic medicine; toxicology; ophthal- 
mology; clinic of surgery; venereal and skin diseases; surgical anatomy 
and operative surgery; chirurgical clinic; psychiatry; and the auxil- 
iary studies, i. e., botany, mineralogy, chemistry, physics, zoology. 
All these branches, taught by excellent authorities, make the medical 
faculty of Warsaw very efficient and worthy of praise. 
Institute of Veterinary -Surgery.—Beside the medical faculty of the 
university, and outside of it, there is in Warsaw also an Institute 
of Veterinary Surgery, with 1 director, 1 vice-director, 3 docenten, 
7 instructors in veterinary surgery, and 1 teacher of the German 
Janguage. This institute is very important, there being only one 
other such school at Charkow. 
The university library.—The library of the old University of Warsaw 
(founded in 1817) was formed out of the various public and private col- 
lections of the old Polish capital, and especially out of the treasures 
of many abolished cloisters. In 1830 it contained 130,000 volumes and 
1,500 manuscripts. The cabinet of curiosities contained 20,000 objects. 
After the suppression of the university, in 1832, in consequence of the 
Polish revolution of 1830, most of the Polish volumes (excluding the 
historical and political books) were transferred. to the principal library 
of the circuit (Lehrbezirk), the library being increased by the library of 
Turkula and some cloister libraries. In 1841 the principal library, 
together with the numismatic cabinet and the museum of antiquities, 
was given over to the new university. Its library is now very large 
and valuable, especially rich in works of Polish literature, Polish his- 
tory, and law. Among the manuscripts are the diaries of the Polish 
Diets, letters of King Wladislaw (1635-1645), and many other docu- 
ments important to Polish history. The library is well catalogued by 
J. Wierzbowski, Polonica, XV ac XVI ss. in bibl. Universitat. Varsov. 
1, 1889,
-P-A-G-E-817
HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 759 
The numismatic cabinet consisted on January 1, 1894, of 4,280 objects, 
the most precious being the silver and gold coins and medals of Polish 
mediyal history. There is besides connected with the university a 
museum of antiquities, a cabinet of plaster figures, an etlinographical 
museum, containing very valuable objects of ethnography from all 
parts of the Russian Empire, also many prehistoric antiquities. <A 
physical cabinet and laboratory, with a mechanical and magnetic station, 
provide for the practical exercises of the physico-mathematical faculty. 
The astronomical and meteorological observatory, with complete 
apparatus, provides for the needs of the respective departments. 
The geodetic cabinet and the chemical laboratories, the mineralogical, 
geological-paleontalogic, botanical, zoological, zootomical, physiological, 
histological, and all the other medical cabinets, laboratories, clinics, and 
hospitals, render the complicated scholarly apparatus necessary for a 
university of the highest order well nigh complete. 
The principal archives of the Polish kingdom.—These archives (Glaw- 
nij Archiv Tsarstva Polskago) are the most valuable source for the 
investigator of Polish history. The mostimportant documents of these 
archives are those of the Metryka Koronna, i. e., the official records, 
conducted by the chancellor and the subchancellor of the kingdom, 
which contained all the documents provided with the royal seal—for 
instance, privileges, treaties, decrees. After the third partition (1795) 
the Polish and Lithuanian records were transferred to St. Petersburg, 
and only one part of the Polish registries was brought back to Warsaw. 
Another part of the Polish and Lithuanian matricule is now stored 
away in the archives of the Imperial Senate at St. Petersburg, a third 
part in the archives of the attorney-general at Moscow. A copy of the 
Lithuanian matricule (1386-1551) and some volumes of the original 
(1775-1792) are stillin Warsaw. The archives contain, furthermore, the 
so-called “Sigillata” (regesta of royal documents from the year 1658 
on), the chancellors’ “Acta” (from 1742 on), the records of various old 
courts (for instance, of the crown tribunals of Piotrkéw and Ldublin), 
of the state, and several provincial diets of King Stanislaus Augustus’s 
commissions of education, finance, and military affairs. With the prin- 
cipal archives the secret archives of the Polish kingdom are combined. 
These were in Cracow till 1765; were then transferred to Warsaw; from 
there, in 1795, together with the above-mentioned matricule, to St. 
Petersburg, whence they were again brought to Warsaw. Those Polish 
documents which had been taken by the Prussians were also given back 
by that Government to the secret archives in Warsaw. The archives 
contain 1,462 documents, the oldest being a papal bull of 1215. These 
are documents of the highest value, not only to Polish history, but also 
to universal history, to the history of culture and civilization, and toa 
large extent to the unexplored history of the relations of the Poles with 
the Slavonic and Western European nations during the dark ages. 
There is, indeed, a mine for scientific and historical research in these
-P-A-G-E-818
  760 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
archives, although treasures are yearly dug out and published by the 
Polish and Russian historians in Warsaw, Cracow, and Lemberg. The 
archives contain, furthermore, among other treasures, the documents of 
the last Polish king and of Kosciuszko, the diplomatic archives of the 
Polish crown and Lithuania (1579-1759), political documents from the 
time of the partitions; also documents from the Russian time (1826- 
1831). The archives are, according to their importance, excellently 
administered by the Polish professor of the university, Adolf Pawitski, 
well arranged and catalogued. They are under the control of the 
central government of the Tsarstvo of Poland and have about 80,000 
volumes in folio.! 
Archives of old records of the kingdom of Poland.—There are still 
other important archives in Warsaw (Archiv starych diel), which con- 
tain the remnant of the records, decrees, accounts, documents, con- 
tracts of the dissolved state council of the Polish king, the various 
commissions of the Polish government and other central magistrates. 
These archives form a part of the present chancellery of the Russian 
central government of the Polish Tsarstwo. By far the greater part of 
these old records had been destroyed or were sold at auction as waste 
paper after the last partition of the country; another part had been 
distributed among the various state ministries, provincial governments, 
and local magistracies. 
Secondary education in Warsaw.—Of secondary schools Warsaw 
possesses 6 gymnasia, 1 real-gymnasium, 2 progymnasia (i. e., incom- 
plete, the upper classes wanting), 1 (male) teachers’ seminary, besides 
4 (female) gymnasia, progymnasium, 1 school of drawing, 1 institute 
for the deaf and dumb and 1 for the blind, 1 Sunday business school 
for merchant clerks, 1 Sunday business school for tradesmen and 
mechanics. These are all Government schools. Outside of them there 
are, however, a large number of private schools of a higher order, 
which are all licensed and provided with teachers who have all finished 
their professional education and are provided with the respective 
diplomas. 
Musical education in Warsaw.—A special feature of higher education 
are the musical institutes of Warsaw. In 1805 the Musical Society was 
organized. Its directors were Fr. Lessel and Count Fr. Krasicki. In 
1812 it was changed to a “Musical Conservatory,” under the directorship 
of Elsner. In 1823 the conservatory had already 164 pupils, among 
them Chopin and Dobrzynski, both pupils of Elsner. In 1858 Moni- 
uszko was director of the conservatory and the leading spirit in Polish 
music. In 1861 Apolinary Kontski reorganized the conservatory, but 
the insurrection of 1863 greatly impaired the progress of that school, as 
well as of all the other institutions; yet the art of- music developed to 
a high degree among the Poles, especially at the capital. 
    
1 There is an excellent description of this famous library by Bandtke and Herbart 
(lithogr.), 1840.
-P-A-G-E-819
HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 761 
All these facilities for schools, from the lowest to the highest order, 
passing over the whole range of human knowledge—its unique libraries, 
its stupendous historical monuments, with their glorious reminiseences— 
make Warsaw the center of the intellectual life of the Polish people. 
Churches and cathedrals help to attain the highest standard of culture 
possible in a modern large city. Famous among them are the Cath- 
olic Cathedral of St. John, founded in 1360, connected with the old 
royal palace by corridors, containing the famous pictures and tombs 
of ancient celebrated Poles; the magnificent Greek Cathedral, fin- 
ished in 1842; the Church of the Holy Cross, finished in 1695, with a 
splendid frontage and valuable images. The Capucin Church, built 
in 1681, contains the admirable marble statue of Jan III. (For a gen- 
eral description of the city, see the author’s article “ Warsaw,” in 
Johnson’s Universal Cyclopedia.) 
Secondary education in the country at large.—As stated before, educa- 
tion has also been entirely reorganized since 1863 over the entire Polish 
country outside of Warsaw, and is steadily progressing, owing to the 
efforts of the Government to Russianize the nation by a thorough and 
extensive Russian education, and still more from the conviction of 
the Polish people that education alone can secure a high estimation 
and prestige of their nationality in the vast empire of which they are 
an integral part. In every Government town there is a gymnasium; 
the former district schools are rapidly changed into progymnasia. 
Although the official language in all the schools is Russian, as well as 
in the courts and all official affairs, yet the Polish language is generally 
known and used and even enriched and polished by the extensive 
printing of Polish books of all grades, while the pulpit is filled almost 
invariably by Polish priests for the Polish population, which is mostly 
Catholic. Especially difficult, if not impossible, is it to extirpate the 
Polish language in the primary schools which are being founded in 
almost all the villages that have an almost exclusive Polish popui D, 
unless it be mixed with numerous Jews and Germans. These schools, 
under the special supervision of Russian school inspectors, succeed, of 
course, in teaching the Russian language, but the latter is seldom used. 
by the children at home and after the obligatory years of schooling 
are over. 
The following secondary schools in the congressional Kingdom have 
certainly not yet lost their Polish character: 
The city of Plock has 3 gymnasia, 1 teachers’ seminary, 1 theological 
seminary. 
The city of Potock (in White Russia) had a Jesuit academy up to 1820; 
from that time a high school, conducted by the order of “ patres pii” 
(patres scholarum piarum). Polock has now only a county gymnasium. 
The cadet school was abolished in 1863. 
The city of Sandomierz has a theological seminary and a gymna- 
sium, 
   
-P-A-G-E-820
  762 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The city of Wloclawek has a theological seminary. 
The city of Kielce has 1 theological and 1 teacher’s seminary. 
The city of Lublin has a theological seminary and a gymnasium. 
The city of Lipno has a gymnasium. 
Teachers’ seminaries are also at WymySlin, Tuchola, Leezyca, Biata, 
Siedlce, Wajwery, an agricultural and forestry academy at Pulawy, a 
business college at Lodz. 
Outside of these there are about 50 public and private high schools 
in the congressional Kingdom. 
Wilno.—We have briefly mentioned the history of the old and famous 
University of Wilno, the ancient capital of Lithuania, its foundation by 
Stephen Batory in 1570, its character as a Jesuit institute, its tenden- 
cies for good and for evil, its renewal by Alexander I in 1803, its pres- 
tige at that time, its suppression in 1833, and the removal of its library 
to St. Petersburg. A medico-surgieal academy replaced. it, but this 
was suppressed in 1842, and thus every trace of the university was 
blotted out. 
But, although the University of Wilno is no longer in existence, yet 
the excellent libraries and archives of the renowned old capital of 
Lithuania make it stilla unique center of learning, especially in Polono- 
Lithuanian history and diplomatics. Most valuable is the public library 
and museum (Publitnaja bibliotekai sostojaStij pri nej muzej). In 1856 
Count Tyszkiewicz founded an antiquarian museum and an archeolog- 
ical commission with it. When the old museum was elosed in 1865 the 
valuable manuscripts of the museum (538 manuscripts and 2,600 docu- 
ments) were transferred to the newly established public library of 
Wilno. In connection with the scholarly expeditions and researches 
of the years 1860-1880, which dug up rich treasures of the literary 
past, a considerable collection of church-Slavonie manuscripts was 
accumulated. The rich archives of Prince Sapieha, of the court of lords 
at Grodno, containing Russian manuscripts of the sixteenth century 
and extensive correspondence of Polish magnates in Government serv- 
ice, were also transferred to this library. It contains, besides, some of 
the most important old Russian manuscripts (for instance, the Turov 
Evangelium of the eleventh century) and numerous literary produc- 
tions from western Russia, partly in the western Russian dialects. For 
the older history of the country there is nowhere more documentary 
material than here. Russian and Polish documents of all descriptions 
abound. 
The department of printed bocks has been enriched by the collec- 
tions of the ancient Roman Catholic cloisters, by confiscations of the 
rich libraries of political criminals, mostly anti-Russian magnates, and 
from various donations and exchanges, mostly of Latin and Polish 
and theological books. 
The antiquarian museum contains the rich collections of its founder, 
Count Tyszkiewiez. Enriched by further donations, it contained in 
e
-P-A-G-E-821
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 763 
1858, among others, 2,900 historic objects and 3,200 coins. Some of 
these valuable objects were later on transferred to the Russian museum 
in Moscow. At present the Wilno museum contains prehistoric, ethno- 
graphical, and mythological objects, old weapons, Christian, old Greek, 
and Roman antiquities, medals and coins, seals, portraits, and works of 
sculpture; all the objects together numbered 11,700 in 1885.1 
‘Wilno still possesses very numerous schools of a higher order—1 
Roman Catholic theological seminary, 1 Greek Catholic seminary, 
1 Christian and 1 Jewish teachers’ seminary, 2 classical gymnasia, 1 
progymnasium, 1 real school, 1 tradesmen’s school, 2 girls’ gymnasia, 
over 20 public and city schools. 
The ruins of the old and historic castle of the Jagiellos still exist as 
a monument of Wilno’s great past, when it was the capital of the 
Lithuanian princes from 1323 on. Among the 18 Roman and 12 Greek 
Catholic churches, the cathedral of St. Stanislaus especially excels 
with its magnificent marble chapel containing the silver coffin, weighing 
3,000 pounds, with the remains of St. Casimir (died 1480), a place of 
pilgrimage for the Polish-Lithuanian people.? 
Wilno has also the central archives of the ancient documents of the 
governments of Wilno, Grodno, Mitisk, Ljublin, and Kowno (Centralnyj 
archiv drevnich aktovych knig). 
As early as the fifteenth century provision had been made in the 
Lithuanian statute, and elsewhere, for the preservation of manuscript 
documents of the grand principality of Lithuania “in the stone houses 
and solid chests.” Thus the materials of the Lithuanian supreme court 
of Wilno, as well as of other courts, various commissions, etc., i. e., 
state documents of the Lithuanian dukes, judiciary charters, local 
records, ete., were gradually collected so completely as to cover local 
history year for year. But the continuous wars and conflagrations 
proved very destructive to the archives, many things were purposely 
destroyed, many documents almost professionally falsified, so that great 
critical tests are necessary for the appreciation of these collections. 
In 1852 the buildings of the suppressed University of Wilno (like 
those of Kief and Witebsk) were turned over to the storing of the een- 
tral archives, and all the above-named documentary treasures, mostly 
Latin and White Russian and Polish, were deposited in that building 
and finally catalogued in 1863. 
The oldest registers of these archives are the documents of the city 
council of Wilno from 1492 on. Among the most important documents, 
historically, are the letters and privileges of Jagiello [the bestowing of 
Magdeburg law (jus Magdeburgicum) upon the capital in 1387], of Sig- 
ismund Keistutowizs, Casimir, ete. The most recent additions are the 
Vide Systematischer Katalog derruss. Biicher, 2 Biinde (mit Zusiitzen), 1879-1888;

archives of the Wilno Chapter, the archives of Ljublin, the archives of 
the Wilno Carmelites. In 1870 the Wilno archives numbered about 
18,000 volumes and 1,700,009 documents." 
The searching, investigating, registering, and cataloguing of these 
documentary treasures, extending at present to 12 volumes of “Akty” 
with many single works, is being performed by the archaographic com- 
mission (Vilenskaja kommissija dla razbora i izdanija drevnych aktoy), 
founded in 1864, In 1842, by the instrumentality and at the expense 
of Governor A. Semenov at Wilno, a temporary commission appointed 
for the investigation of the documents and their transfer to the arche- 
ographic commission at St. Petersburg was decreed. 
Witebsk.—The central archives of Witebsk, situated in the ancient 
cloister of the Dominican monks and coming under the supervision of 
the ministry of the interior, was established in 1863 to store the judi- 
ciary and forensic documents of the old Polish governments of Witebsk 
and Mohyléw (Mogilew) from the sixteenth century to 1800. 
But, as in the Polish state the courts had administrative functions 
also, there are other valuable materials relating to the economic and 
political conditions, church history, and ethnography of those districts 
of the old Kingdom, amounting to 1,823 volumes. 
Nevertheless, while there exists all the elements for the highest cul- 
ture and education in this vast country, known for many centuries by 
the historical name of Lithuania, and called in the official Russian lan- 
guage the Country of the Northwest, it is at present perhaps the most 
inanimate country in Europe. According to Russian administrative 
division, Lithuania consists of the governments of Wilno, Grodno, 
Kowno, Mifisk, Mohyléw, and Witebsk. It occupies a territory larger 
than the Kingdom of Italy, and has almost 9,000,009 inhabitants 
(that is about 40 per cent of the population of the Kingdom of Poland 
proper). The proportion of industrial wealth per inhabitant is 4 rubles 
annually against 23 rublesin Poland. Commerce is reduced to a mini- 
mum, and is mostly in the hands of Jews, who are more numerous in 
Lithuania than anywhere else in Poland. 
Regarding public instruction, Lithnania occupies almost the lowest 
place among all the provinces of European Russia, only the district of 
Orenburg, with its Bashkir and Tartar population, ranks lower in this 
respect. There are but 20 secondary schools with 5,800 pupils (that is 
40 per cent of what there were thirty years ago). Primary instruction 
is even more neglected. The most civilized province of the country, 
the government of Kowno, with 1,600,000 inhabitants, has but 12,500 
children in the public schools. 
Newspapers are almost entirely wanting. Beside the official Russian 
Wilenski Wiestnik (Messenger of Wilno) there is no journal in the

country, Polish publications being prohibited as well as the Polish 
language, since this country, though it was united with Poland for 
many centuries, is not considered as Polish territory. 
HIGHER EDUCATION IN AUSTRIAN POLAND. 
In Galicia (Polish Halicz), the Polish crown land of Austria, which 
comprises the old kingdoms of Galicia and Lodomeria, the duchies of 
Oswiecim (Auschwitz) and Zator, and the grand duchy of Cracow, the 
entire school system, with the exception of the universities and schools 
of technology and arts with university rank, is governed by the supreme 
council of schools at Lemberg. This supreme council of schools and 
the rectors of the universities of Cracow and Lemberg, who are also ex- 
officio members of the Galician Diet (Landtag), and the rector of the 
school of technology at Lemberg are directly responsible and subject to 
the minister of public worship and instruction in Vienna (Hungary has 
had her own minister of public instruction since 1867). 
The primary schools in Galicia are steadily improving, but although 
the law enforces compulsory attendance at the national schools for 
children between 6 and 12 years, and although parents are subject to 
fines for neglecting to send them, the percentage of those children, who 
ought to attend the common schools is still very low. 
The secondary schools are the gymnasia, real gymnasia, and real 
schools. A complete gymnasium provides for a course of eight years’ 
study, divided into two parts of four years each. The lower course not 
only prepares for the higher, but is also complete in itself for those who 
are unable or unwilling to proceed further. In passing from one class 
to another the scholars undergo a very searching examination. The 
curriculum of an Austrian gymnasium does not differ greatly from that 
of the German gymnasia; only all the courses are conducted in Galician 
gymnasia and other secondary schools in the national language of the 
people, i. e., Polish and Ruthenian, the former being in the majority 
and greatly predominating in the west, the latter in the east. 
Of the 11 universities of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, Galicia 
alone has 2—Cracow and Lemberg. Of the 8 schools of technology, 
Galicia has 1 at Lemberg, admission to which generally is conditioned 
by a successful graduation from an upper real school, a gymnasinm or 
areal gymnasium, which insures the possibility of imparting a high 
scientific education. The complete technical course extends over five 
years. 
The standard of these institutions will be described somewhat in 
detail in the following pages. 
The New University of Cracow.—The famous old Jagiellon University 
of Cracow (Universytet Jagiellofiski w Krakowie) has been illustrated 
in its most general characteristics in the foregoing pages of this study. 
We have noticed its respectable age, the papal bull of May 12, 1364, 
which permitted King Casimir the Great to establish a “studium 
 
-P-A-G-E-824
    766 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
generale in qualibet licita facultate,” the many vicissitudes of its exist- 
ence, its universal reputation and foremost rank at the end of the 
fifteenth century owing to the noble humanistic and astronomical 
studies at that stronghold of highest learning. For centuries the 
Universytet Jagiellofiski formed the center of scientific life in Poland, 
was a strong advocate of religious toleration and of that noblest flower 
of the highest learning, freedom of thought and conscience. Roman 
Catholic, as the university always was, it sustained along, protracted 
struggle with the Jesuit order, whose spirit it deemed harmful to the 
freedom of the Polish nation. But with the degeneration of the latter 
in its constant wars with Russia, the Cossacks, the Turks, the Swedes, 
the Brandenburgers, the Prussians, and in the eternal feuds among the 
magnates themselves, the university, too, degenerated and finally 
vanished. entirely. 
The university, completely reorganized, was reopened on October 18, 
1817, and on October 5, 1826, was solemnly confirmed by the three 
protecting powers of the Republie of Cracow: Austria, Russia, and 
Prussia. In 1846 the Republic, and with it the university of the 
capital, became Austrian again, toincrease the wealth of ten universities 
by a new brilliant star. But the attempt to introduce German as the 
official language into the philosophical, medical, and law faculties (the 
theological faculty being Catholie and Polish throwghout could, of course, 
not bechanged) by ministerial decree of October 29, 1853, failed. Between. 
February 4, 1861, and April 30,1570, the Polish language was gradually 
and completely restored to cultivate and to treasure up the valuable 
civilization of the first western Slavonic nation, a great and noble task 
which is being fulfilled with a peaceable and affeetiomate devotion. 
The administration of the wniversity in 1892 was conducted at an 
expense of about: 339,550 florins, which included the establishment of 
the second eourse of the agricultural department in the philosophical 
faculty. The expenses of the fiscal year 1893. amounted to 393,794 
florins, including 30,000 florins for the establishment of the third 
course of the agricultural department. The governmental contribu- 
tion for covering the expenses was 379,151 florins. The budget of 
expenses for 1895. was. 531,296 florins, of which 485,060 were paid by 
the Government. 
The Imperial Academy of Seiences.—Olosely connected with the uni- 
versity, if not actually a part of it, is the Imperial Academy of Sciences 
at Cracow which is composed of a body of the most eminent men in the 
mental and natural sciences. With the exception of the Academy of 
Sciences in Vienna, which had been proposed by Leibnitz, but was 
founded on May 30, 1846, and which publishes the great scholarly 
records of its sessions, the “Fontes rerum Austriacarum,” the “Serip- 
tores ecclesiastici latini,” ete. ; the former is the most important academy 
of sciences in the Austrian Monarehy. As for scholarship and bril- 
liancy in Slavonic researches it surpasses even Vienna and accomplishes

for the western Slavonic world what the South Slavonie Academy of 
Arts and Sciences at Agram (Croatia) (Jugoslavenska Akademija znan- 
osti i umjetnosti) accomplishes for the south and that of Petersburg 
for the eastern Slavonic world. Both the latter academies: are older, 
it is true, the Agram Academy having been founded im 1836 as “eru- 
dita societas,” and as an academy in: 1861, while that of St. Petersburg 
(Imperatorskaja Akademija nauk) began its activity in 1725 with for- 
eign academicians throughout. The Academy of Scienees. at Cracow 
was founded only in 1872, taking origin from the Society of Sciences 
which had existed since 1815. 
The intellectual movement of the Bohemian nation has brought 
about the youngest but most active academy in the Austrian Monarehy. 
The imperial consent to the statute for the establishment of the Bohe- 
mian Emperor Francis Joseph Academy of Sciences, Literature, and 
Arts (Ceské akademie cisate Frantiika Josefa provedy, slovesnost a 
wnéni) was. granted on January 23, 1890; on October 18 the: first gen- 
eral assembly took place. On May 18, 1891, the solemn opening of the 
academy was celebrated. This: academy is divided inte: four classes: 
(1) Philosophy, state, law, and social sciences, history, and archeology ; 
(2) mathematics, natural sciences, and medicine; (3) philology’; (4) belles- 
lettres, fine arts, and music. The many publications of this: academy 
are of the highest order and importance. 
In faet among all the Slavonie peoples, not only in Austria and 
Russia, but also in the Danube Principalities, Bulgaria and Servia, this 
intellectual movement is going on and giving vent to its energy by the 
establishment. of universities. and: academies of sciences. 
The academy of Cracow has a fixed endowment of 16,000 florins: from 
the Government; 20,000: florins: im 1895. Its, protector was Archduke 
Karl Ludwig (died a few weeks: ago); the vice-protector is the Pelish 
ex-minister of finance in Austria, the former professor of political 
economy ati the University of Cracow, Julian Dunajewski; its presi- 
dent, Stanislaw Count Tarnowski, professor of Polish literature. The 
academy is divided into (1) the philological department, (2) the his- 
torico-philosophical department, and (3) the department of mathematies 
and natural sciences. : 
Since the greatest scholars of the Polish nation are members of the 
Academy of Seiences in Cracow (beside some eminent foreigners and 
the corresponding members), it may be. appropriate to give the names 
of the actual members, to convey an idea of Poland’s greatest scholars 
of the present time. 
In the philological department [besides a few university professors 
of Cracow in the respective departments, Stefan Pawlicki, professor 
of dogmaties and religious philosophy; Fryderyk Zoll, professor of 
Roman law; Franciszek Kasparek, professor of international law and

Fryderyk Zoll, There has never been in Poland such a scientific 
movement, especially in the domain of Polish and Slavonic history, as 
at present. It is perhaps only surpassed by the revival of national 
learning in Bohemia, where the Ozech University of Prague was abso- 
lutely severea fro.2 the old common university with its German pre- 
ponderance, and opened in the academic year 1882-83. The Bohemian 
technical high school in Prague was erected in 1868, and has been 
administered as a State institution since 1875. Owing to this scientific 
movement the historical sciences have been marvelously revived, but, 
although it would be unjust to limit the many historical scholars of 
the Polish nation, still the above names fairly represent the leaders of 
thought in that science.

There is one great Polish historian in the garb of a novelist who has 
not yet attained the rank of an academician; it is Henryk Sienkiewitz, 
but he has attained the rank of the foremost Polish historical novelist, 
and may be well compared with the great German historical novelists 
Gustav Freytag, Felix Dahn, and Joseph Victor von Scheffel, who 
have been overwhelmed with academical honors in Germany. As these 
great historical novelists have illuminated German history and made it 
popular and accessible to the broad masses of the German people more 
than the tremendous volumes of the Monumenta Germani Historica 
could ever do, so has Henryk Sienkiewitz in his three admirable histor- 
ical novels, With Fire and Sword, The Deluge, and Rodzina Polonieckich, 
performed the most masterly work for the illustration of the downfall of 
the Commonwealth under King Jan Kazimierz.! 
In the mathematical scientific department, Benedykt Dybowski, Uni- 
versity of Lemberg; Heinr. Ferd. Hoyer, Warsaw; Franz Mertens, 
University of Graz; Julian Niedzwiedzki, Lemberg; Louis Pasteur 
(deceased), Paris; Bronislaw Radziszewski, Lemberg; Eduard Strass- 
burger, Bonn; William Thomson, Glasgow; Rudolf Virchow, Berlin; 
Wiad. Zajaczkowski, Lemberg; Jan Franke, Lemberg; Marcell Nencki, 
University of Petersburg; Gioy. Schiaparelli, director of the Astronom- 
ical Observatory, Milan; and 16 corresponding members. 
This Imperial Academy of Sciences, in connection with the great 
Jagiellon University of Cracow, is undoubtedly the center of the high- 
est learning in the Polish nation, and if Warsaw is still considered as 
the political capital, Cracow is surely to be considered as the intellectual 
seat of Polonism. 
Cracow and Lemberg are the Polish universities par excellence; but 
as the latter has the strong Ruthenian element of Galicia to contend 
with, the former is the rallying point of the Polish students of the three 
adjoining countries, who wish to be educated in the Polish spirit and 
culture. The number of students in 1892 was 1,227, which increased in 
1893 to 1,283, but fell off in 1894 to 1,242, and rose to 1,290 in 1895 (sum- 
mer semester, 1,230). Of these, 1,137 were regular students who had 
fulfilled all the preceding conditions before matriculation—i. e., were 
provided with the certificate of maturity for university studies—and 105 
were hearers who are not admitted to the State examinations without 
having subsequently fulfilled the conditions required. There were 66 
(Catholic) theologians, 486 students in law, 517 in medicine, and 173 in 
philosophy. In 1895 there were in theology (Catholic) 69, in jurispru- 
dence 608, in medicine 438, in philosophy 128, in agriculture 47, and in 
pharmacy 14. The present rector is Stanislaw Smolka.” 
The university is in its four faculties well represented by the most

of this distinguished body.

distinguished professors, mostly Poles. There are 7 full professors in 
the Catholic theological faculty who teach divinity in a four years’ 
course, as follows: Pastoral theology, exegesis of the New Testament, 
church history, general dogmatics and religious philosophy, special dog- 
matics, exegesis of the Old Testament, Semitic languages, canon law. 
The faculty of law and political sciences is represented by 8 full pro- 
fessors, 4 associate professors, and 4 privat-docenten, who prepare the 
students for the legal profession in a four years’ course. Instruction is 
given in Roman law, philosophy of law and international law, Austrian 
civillaw, Austrian political and administrative law and statistics, penal 
law and pleading, canon law, old Polish law (by 2 professors), political 
economy, commercial and banking law, Austrian law of finance and 
finance sciences, and German law. The Polish and local Galician legis- 
lative conditions, however, do not seem to be as well represented as in 
the same faculty of the Lemberg University. Two great seminaries— 
that of the legal sciences and that of the political sciences—provide 
for the practical education of the students. 
The medical faculty is conducted by 12 full professors, 11 associate 
professors, and 7 privat-docenten. It is safe to say that no branch of 
the medical sciences is neglected, and it is only to be stated that the 
instruction in medicine, distributed over a course of five years, is as 
complete as possible. Practical education is given to the students in 
the medical clinic, in the surgical clinic, in the anatomical-surgical cabi- 
net, in the ophthalmological clinic, in the gynecological clinic, in the 
aseptic-gynecological laboratory, in the pathological-chemical insti- 
tute, the anatomical institute, the pharmacognostical institute, the 
physiological institute, the pathological-anatomical institute, the insti- 
tute of veterinary surgery, the medico-forensic institute, the pediatric 
clinic, the clinic for skin and venereal diseases, and the institute for 
general and experimental pathology. All these medical institutions 
are carried on at an annual expense of 42,728 florins. 
The philosophical faculty has 23 full professors, 5 associate professors, 
11 privat-docenten, and 1 lector in French. Twelve members of this 
faculty belong also to the Academy of Sciences. The branches taught 
in this faculty are astronomy and higher mathematics (an astronomical 
observatory, founded in 1791, furnishes it with the scholarly apparatus 
for research); mineralogy (mineralogical institute); archeology (arche- 
ological institute); general history, Austrian history, and Polish his- 
tory (historical seminary); Polish literature and Slavic philology 
(Slavonic seminary); botany, anatomy, and physiology of plants 
(botanical laboratory), to which department the botanical garden of 
Cracow, administered at an annual cost of 3,500 florins, is attached; 
mathematics with a mathematical seminary; geography; German 
philology, with a seminary; classical philology, with a philological 
seminary and proseminary; romance philology; physics, with a phys- 
ical institute; history of art, with a corresponding institute; geology

and paleontology, with a geological institute; chemistry ana agricu.- 
tural chemistry, with two chemical institutes and laboratories and an 
institute for agricultural chemistry; zoology and zootomy, with the 
two respective institutes; farming and agriculture, cattle raising, with 
institute; comparative anatomy; philosophy, pedagogics and didactics, 
and Sanscrit, represented only by 1 privat-docent, respectively. The 
laboratories and institutes are conducted at an expense of at least 
12,100 florins a year. 
The university library.—The library attached to the university is one 
of the oldest and richest in the Austrian Monarchy. At the end of 1892 
it contained 213,779 works, in 283,858 volumes; 5,150 MSS., in 6,485 
volumes; 1,702 maps, 7,693 engravings and pictures, 3,057 musical 
works, and 9,476 coins and medals. At the beginning of 1895, 224,774 
works, in 300,029 volumes; 5,321 MSS., in 6,755 volumes; 1,751 maps, 
7,730 engravings, 3,222 musical works, and 9,481 coins and medals. 
The library has a most interesting history, which has been excellently 
narrated by G. S. Bandtke, Historya biblioteki Universytetu Jagiel- 
lotiskiego w Krakowie. Krak. 1821." 
When King Wladislaw Jagiello reorganized the University of 
Cracow, in 1400, and granted to it rich endowments and revenues, a 
library was also founded and was continually improved. Endowment 
was left to it from time to time by public-spirited citizens. Andreas 
Olszowski, archbishop of Gnesen, left in 1671 the sum of 10,000 florins 
' for the opening of a reading hall. In 1775 the newly established com- 
mission of education arranged the library, and attached to it and cata- 
logued all the distracted collections of the burse and collegia of the 
university. After the third partition the library fell a share to Aus- 
tria, to which State it has belonged ever since, except during the time 
of the independent republic of Cracow (1809-1846). 
The manuscripts of the library are catalogued by Wiad., Wislocki 
Catalogus Codicum manuseriptorum bibliothece universitatis Jag. Cra- 
coviensis, Cracov. 1877-1881, 2 vols. The other treasures are described 
by Karol Estreicher. Biblioteka’ Jagiellotiska. Krakéw 1881, and 
Przechadzka (guide) po bibliotekie Jagicllofiskiej. Krakéw 1882, 
The library is maintained at an annual cost of 20,570 florins (21,470 
florins in 1895) in addition to the regular fees, and was used by 2,356 
readers and 2,383 guests; 6,000 works, in 15,000 volumes, were loaned 
out in the year 1894. 
The State archives.—The archives of the town and rural forensic 
affairs of the palatinate of Cracow (Archivum actorum castrensium et 
terrestrium palatinatus Cracoviensis) were founded at the end of the 
eighteenth century by the unification of various smaller archives. They 
contain Acta judicii capitanealis Cracoviensis 1428-1792, Acta judicii 
terrestris Cracov. colloquiorum generalium, judiciorum in curia regis 
Minerva, p. 381.

Acta castra Biecensis 1436-1793, Acta terrestria Czechoviensia 1401- 
1783. These archives are endowed with 6,000 florins. 
As to secondary schools, Cracow has three gymnasia—that of St. 
Anne, founded in 1588, with 560 pupils; that of St. Hyacinthe, founded 
in 1858, with 458 pupils, and the Third Imperial Gymnasium, founded in 
1883, with 497 pupils. There are several real schools, besides two theo- 
logical seminaries. The following institutions supply instruction in all 
the other pursuits not covered by the university and the polytechnic 
school: The Polish State Commercial College, with 86 pupils and 2,000 
florins state, subvention; the Agricultural College, the Tradesmen 
College, the Czartoryski Museum,! and the Academy of Fine Arts. 
The great painter Jan Matejko, who died in 1893, was the director of 
the last-named institution. Two State teachers’ seminaries—one for 
males and one for females—both founded in 1871, have 183 and 240 can- 
didates, respectively. The official language is Polish. 
The Polish State Industrial School, with an architectural, mechanical 
engineering, and chemical department, and workshops for decorative 
drawing and designing, has 158 pupils and 135 in the trade school 
attached to it. 
The University of Lemberg (Lw6w).—An admirable history of the 
University of Lemberg, of 442 large octavo pages, was published at the 
end of the year 1894 by the two professors of the university, Drs. 
Ludwik Finkel and Stanislaw Starzytiski, under the title Historya 
Universytetu Lwowskiego, Lwéw, Nakladem Senatu Akademickiego, 
1894. The older history up to the year 1869 was written by Professor 
Finkel, the last twenty-five years of its development by Professor 
Starzytiski. For the first time, allthe archives were opened and searched 
by the authors to give an authentic account of the history of Galicia 
and Lodomeria as related. to the university. 
After an introduction of 9 pages by the rector of 1894, Ludwik 
Cwikliiski, a list of the rectors of the university is given from 1784 to 
1894. 
The academical schools before the foundation of the university are 
treated atlength. In the same year in which the Jagielloiska Akademia 
was founded, two months after the issue of the letter patent erecting the 
studium generale at Cracow which was “to attract the dwellers of dis- 
tant lands” (longinquarum incolas regionum ad eius allicere accessum), 
1This museum was originally founded, in 1813, by Prince Adam Czartoryski, at 
Putawy, on the Vistula, and taken to Petersberg in 1830, but a part of it was rescued 
and carried to Galicia and Paris. In 1876 the whole collection was carried to Cracow. 
The museum contains 100,000 volumes, 5,070 MSS., and 1,202 documents. Catalogus

according to the Codex diplomaticus univ. studii generalis Cracoviensis, 
ed. 1870, King Jagiello ordered a high school (“szkola metropolitalna”) to 
be erected at Lemberg and to be governed by the commune itself (utipsi 
cives scholas construant edificent et reforment rectoremque scholarum 
eligant valentem et plebano presentent.)! For two centuries this met- 
ropolitan school was in a flourishing condition. Its pupils were divided 
in three classes—primani, secundani, et tertiani. Instruction was given 
not only in the seven arts, but also in Latin, and with the dawn of the 
renaaissance, in Greek, too. The graduates of this school study philoso- 
phy in Cracow, and in the foreign universities of Padua, Bologna, Rome, 
and Paris, whence they bring home their doctorates. Among its many 
distinguished scholars the three greatest names of the early epoch of 
Polish humanism—Bursius, Ursyn, and Simonides—are grouped around 
this school in the last quarter of the sixteenth century until they are 
drawn to the famous new academy founded by Jan Zamoyski.? “What- 
ever there is of brilliant scholarship in our city,” write the aldermen of 
Lemberg as late as 1662 to the rector of the University of Cracow, “is 
derived from the Metropolitan Academy. Our Senate, our Government, 
is composed in its majority of pupils of this academy.” 
When about the middle of the sixteenth century, during the storms 
of the Reformation, not only the Academy of Cracow, but all the other 
schools of renown began to become disintegrated, there sprang up Prot- 
estant, Calvinist, and Dissenting schools, and against them Catholic 
schools, ready and prepared to war for the old faith. All the other 
schools fell, as it were, into lethargy waiting for better times. With 
especial zeal the Society of Jesus undertook to spread education among 
the Catholic youths to make them strong for the impending battle. 
The Jesuit schools, called collegia, sprang up in all the Catholic coun- 
tries. Introduced into Poland in the year 1564 by the famous Cardinal 
Hosius, the founder of the still flourishing Lyceum Hosianum in Brauns- 
berg (Prussia), they established colleges in all the larger towns of 
Poland. In1584 Jacob Wujek, S. J., a famous Bible scholar, and Bene- 
dykt Herbest, S. J., some time professor in the Metropolitan Academy, 
came to Lemberg and began scholastic work. In the next year a rebel- 
lion arose against the Jesuit fathers, but Aquaviva, the then general of 
the order and the author of the celebrated Ratio-studiorum of the Jesuit 
schools, succeeded in establishing a permanent settlement in 1591, the 
first prefect (superior) of which was Martin Laterna, a scholar of the 
Braunsberg school and of the Academy of Wilno, the adviser of King 
Stephen Batory, and the author of the Spiritual Harp. In 1596 there 
were already in the Lemberg college 6 professors and 1 superior. In 
1608 it was raised in rank, had 32 professors, among whom were 16

priests, and 200 students. The humanities were taught by 3 professors, 
moral theology by 2, controversial theology by1. In 1612 a philosoph- 
ical, in 1613 a mathematical course, were added. In 1633 the number 
of students reached 550 and the college became more flourishing; but 
the frightful wars that swept over Poland, the Cossack and Tartar 
invasions, the Russian, the Swedish, the Brandenburg wars, so graph- 
ically described in Henryk Sienkiewicz’s masterly bistorical novel, The 
Deluge, gradually ruined the college. In 1649 there were only 26 stu- 
dents; in 1653 only 4 theological hearers; in 1656 the theological course 
was entirely closed.! 
When the waters of the deluge that had swept over Poland began to 
subside, King Jan Kazimiersz turned his attention to the cily of Cracow, 
which almost lay in ruins. In January, 1661, was issued from the 
royal chancery the order for the foundation of the academy or univer- 
sity of Lemberg, which was to be placed on the same footing with the 
universities of Cracow and Wilno. The very interesting Latin docu- 
ment is reprinted on pages 21, 22, and shows the pride of the King in 
the Polish institutions of learning and his desire to emulate his great 
predecessors. The university was to be founded under the auspices of 
the Jesuits: 
* * * faciliter ac libenter in animum induximus, ut Collegio Leopoliensi 
Societatis Jesu Academice dignitatis accessio Nobis annuentibus fiat, titulusque 
Universitatis doferatur. Damus igitur potestatem in eodem Leopoliensi Socictatis 
Jesu Collegio Generale Studium in omni licita facultate constituendi: Theologiac 
nimirum tam Scholasticae quam Moralis, Philosophiae, Matheseos; Juris utriusque, 
Medicinac Liberaliumque Artium et Disciplinarum ac Scientiarum omnino omnium, 
quascunque predicti patres Societatis Jesu tractandas ibidem per se vel per alios 
censucrint, pro ipsorum arbitrio ac instituto, consuctogue Academiarum atquo 
Universitatum more et praxi. * % 
But there was an outcry all over the Kingdom against this founda- 
tion. The Jagiello university especially resented ‘the interference of 
the Jesuits with its own rights and privileges.” The Academy of Zam- 
ojski, too, opposed it. Even the commune of Lemberg—senatus popu- 
lusque Leopoliensis—arose against the foundation. And, indeed, the 
school was never successful; in 1672 only one class was opened; in 
the humanities and philosophy there were only a few students. Even 
when, in 1677, the number rose to 500, among whom were the sons of 
the most distinguished families, and, though physics and anatomy 
were taught, for which no privilege existed, as appears from an edict 
of Augustus IL (May 13, 1706), “‘that only the one university of Cracow 
shall have the right of the four faculties,” the academy could not stand 
against the public opinion of the whole country. In spite of a royal

of Vienna: “Historia collegii Leopoliensis Societatis Jesu manu propria Matthiae

1665, quo anno obdormivit in Domino.” The best account on the Jesuit colleges in

edict of 1763, however, to close the academy, and a papal renunciation 
of the bull granting its establishment, instruction was carried on till 
the dissolution of the order by papal decree. (Bull of Clemens XIV of 
1773.) Meanwhile the political upheaval of the first partition of Poland 
entirely changed the constellation of the affairs of Lemberg as well as 
those of the whole realm. 
Under Austrian rule Galicia had the advantages of the school reform 
carried on by Empress Maria Theresa in all her dominions. Count 
J, A. Pergen, the director of the Oriental Academy in Vienna, who had 
elaborated a masterly plan of public education, but a rash and radical 
man who would “with one stroke of the pen revolutionize everything,” 
was appointed the first administrator and governor of the newly acquired 
province of Galicia with almost sovereign powers. The edict of appoint- 
ment? reads as follows: “Cum plena facultate, ut nomine Nostro (i. e., 
Me Theresiz (occupatas provincias administret et quidquid ad ordi- 
nandam iuste administrationis normam spectare visum fuerit, in opus 
redigat.” First of all the bad sanitary condition of the country and the 
great mortality made the establishment of a medical college indispensa- 
ble; physicians, surgeons, and midwives were wanting; the other 
higher schools could be gradually founded. Thus a number of eminent 
medical men were dispatched from Vienna to establish the school and 
to organize medical service over the new province. 
The public schools, being in a wretched condition, had to be reor- 
ganized and put under proper inspection. The Jesuit college and the 
academy were transformed into an Austrian lyceum, professors for the 
German language were appointed, chairs for logic, metaphysics, and 
ethics as well as for all the branches of jurisprudence were established, 
eyen mechanics and technology, cartography, and geodesy for the 
surveying of the new territory were taught. In 1776 the Collegium 
nobilium or Collegium Theresianum (Ritterakademie) was estab- 
lished for the sons of the noble families of Galicia. All these new 
schools were administered by a special commission in Lemberg estab- 
lished by the Empress for the Galician schools (in Studiensachen 
aufgestellte k. k. Commission in den K6nigreichen Galicien und 
Lodomerien). 
The Empress conceived the idea of founding a university in Lemberg 
asearly as 1774. In 1776 the imperial chancery wrote to the Lemberg 
government on the question, ‘whether the city would be suitable for a 
university rather than Zamos¢é,” where an academy already existed, or 
Przemy'sl which lay in the center of the country and was the seat of a 
bishop. But the plan did not mature during her life. An edict of 1777 
speaks only of “several trunks (corpora) of higher schools;” there was 
not one large body which could be called a university. The war of the

Bavarian succession, the difficulties with Prussia, and the death of the 
great Empress in 1780 prevented the establishment of a great uni- 
versity in Lemberg. Her noble son, Joseph II, finished in 1784 what 
his great mother had begun,! and the present Emperor laid the last 
corner stone by the establishment of the medical faculty in Septem- 
ber, 1894. 
Emperor Joseph II, the most enlightened ruler of Austria in the last 
century, wanted the university to be built anew, not handicapped by 
any old privileges and duties, as a monument of modern times. Roman 
Catholic and Greek orthodox theology were to be treated side by side. 
The German and Roman law (ius publicum fiir Reichsgeschichte und 
Staatenkunde), heretofore the only branches taught in the faculties of 
law, were to be enlarged for tho special needs of the Polish population 
(Wolf, p. 6: “Da diese Kanzeln sich meistens nur mit dem deutschen 
Staatsrechte und der deutschen Staatsgeschichte beschiftigen, diese 
aber fiir die galizischen Einwohner nie von einem besonderen Nutzen 
sein kann”). Never was a university founded with such a high spirit 
of liberty, generosity, and toleration for the individuality of a con- 
quered nation, never were the good wishes for the divided nation more 
sincerely expressed than in Emperor Joseph’s diploma of October 21, 
1784: 
* * * Die landesviiterliche Sorgfalt, welche unser vorziigliches Augenmerk jeder- 
zeit auf die Bildung der Jugend lenket, hat uns bewogen fiir unsere Kénigreiche 
Galizien und Lodomerien, dann die Herzogthiimer Oswigcim und Zator eine hoho 
Schule oder vollstiindige Universitit in der Hauptstadt Lemberg zuerrichten. * * * 
From such beginnings the university arose and through many vicis- 
situdes reached its present high standard, in numbers the fourth uni- 
versity of the Austrian Crown (after Vienna, Budapest, Prague). As 
to the Austrian possessions of the old Kingdom of Poland the Univer- 
sity of Lemberg is the second great center of Polish learning of the 
highest order, though in numbers it surpasses even the University of 
Cracow by 141 students (cf. Minerva, 1895-96). Lemberg (Lw6w), being 
the principal city in the old palatinate of Little Russia (Ruska) in the 
Polish and restricted sense of the term, has a strong Malo-Russian or 
Ruthenian population with their own language, to which large conces- 
sions must be made in the university and higher and lower schools. 
The Staropigiiski Institute is devoted to the encouragement of the study 
of the Mato-Russian language, and has issued some important works, 
such as editions of old South Russian chronicles. A good library is 
attached to the institute. 
King Augustus III intended to establish a university in Lemberg, 
and even obtained the sanction of Pope Clemens XIIT in 1759; but the 
disturbances of the Seven Years’ war did not allow this plan to mature. 
Only in 1784 was the old plan realized by the great and noble reformer,

Emperor Joseph II; the university later on, bearing the name “K. K. 
Franzens- Universitat in Lemberg (Cesarska Krolewska Universytet 
imienia Cesarsza Franciszka I we Lwowie),” was founded at this time 
without the sanction of the Pope. On the 3d of November, 1784, the 
solemn inauguration took place; but it was not prosperous at first, 
and in 1803 the university was changed into a simple lyceum. On the 
21st of November, 1817, it was reestablished and reorganized as a 
university, without a medical faculty, however, which was established 
only in September, 1894. During the Polish Revolution, in 1848, the 
bombardment of the city also damaged the university building, but 
the most irreparable loss was the burning of about 40,000 volumes of 
books. 
The old policy of the Austrian Government having been the German- 
ization of its Polish demain, the language for instruction and affairs 
was German througliout until the 22d of March, 1862. The necessity 
of allowing perfect freedom in the use of the native Polish and 
Ruthenian languages was then acknowledged. Since July 4, 1871, the 
Polish language has been generally used. In the theological faculty, 
however, the lectures and seminary instruction are given in the Latin 
language, with the exception of pastoral theology, catechetics, and 
methodology as well as pedagogics which are given in the Polish and 
Ruthenian (Russian) languages. In the law faculty all lectures are 
delivered in Polish excepting the courses on the Austrian penal laws . 
and penal process by 1 professor and 1 privat-docent which are deliv- 
ered in Ruthenian. Of course, Ruthenian philology and literature and 
German philology and literature are taught in their respective lan- 
guages. With the establishment of the medical faculty in the academic 
year 1893-94, the university is now complete. 
The financial management of the university, which, of course, is a 
State institution, was in 1892 conducted with an appropriation of 106,800 
florins, which rose to 245,356 florins during the fiscal year 1895, the 
Government contributing 213,674 florins. An extraordinary appropria- 
tion of 14,100 florins served for the purchase of the scientific apparatus 
in the chemical laboratory (1,000 florins), changes in the university 
building (4,100 florins), last installment for the erection of the chemical 
institute (4,000 florins), second installment for the scientific equipment 
of the latter institute (1892). 
In 1893 the university expenses amounted to 169,805 florins, toward 
which sum the Government had to contribute 158,578 florins. 
The university, like all the other Austrian universities, is divided into 
four faculties—the theological, the law, the medical (about which no 
data have yet been given out), and the philosophical faculties, the latter 
embracing both the historico-philological and the physico-mathematical 
faculties of Warsaw and most of the other Russian universities. 
At the head of the University of Lemberg stands the Imperial Royal 
Academic Senate (Cesarski Krolewski Senat Academicki), composed of 
ED 95——25*

  T78 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the rector magnificus,' at the same time the president of the academic 
council, the prorector, i.e., the rector of the preceding year, the deans 
(dziekani) of the faculties, and the deans of the preceding year (pro- 
dziekani), 1 delegate from each faculty, respectively, and the secretary 
and notary, 12 members in all. 
The academic senate takes care of the general affairs of the university, 
its property, the discipline of the collegium of instructors, and decides 
all disputes that may arise between the faculties. Disputes between 
the senate itself and the faculties are decided by the ministry for 
cultus and education. 
The matriculation of students as regular hearers can take place only 
after they have passed the examination of maturity in a gymnasium. 
At the beginning of the academic year (October) 1892-93, there were 
1,283 matriculated hearers in the University of Lemberg. In October, 
1893, there were 950 regular and 124 special hearers, distributed as 
follows: 322 in theology, 585 in law, 167 in philosophy. In the summer 
semester, 1894, there were 1,413 students. In 1895 the number of 
matriculated hearers was 1,445. 
The Catholic theological faculty of Lemberg is composed of 8 pro- 
fessors, 1 privat docent, 2 instructors (nauezyciele) for Polish and Ruthe- 
nian catechetics and methodology, respectively, and 2 adjuncts, all of 
them being priests and doctors of theology. 
The study of theology, like that of law and philosophy, is distributed 
over four years. The curriculum in the summer semester 1893-94 will 
give a fair example of what is being done in theology at the University 
of Lemberg: 
First year.—General dogmatics, five hours a week. Sacred history (historia sacra) 
from the beginning of the world to Christ’s birth, including biblical geography and 
archeology and a special introduction to the Holy Scriptures, four hours a week. 
Exegesis to Jesaias from the Latin Vulgate, two hours a week. Exegesis to First 
Book of Samuel from the original Hebrew text, three hours a week. Grammar of the 
Arabic language with practical exercises, two hours a week. Philosophico-theolog- 
ical propxdeutics, fourhours a week. 
Second year.—Special dogmatics, five hours, Introduction to the New Testament 
(second part), three hours. Exegesis of the New Testament from the text of the Vul- 
gate, three hours. Exegesis of the New Testament from the original Greek text 
(Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans), three hours. Higher exegesis (exegesis sublimior) 
from the original Greek text of the Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, one 
hour. 
Third year.—Moral theology, five hours. Church history, five hours. Pedagogics, 
two hours (Polish and Russian). 
Fourth year.—Pastoral (practical) theclogy, five hours (Polish and Russian). Insti- 
tutions of canon law, five hours. Catechetics and methodology, five hours (Polish 
and Russian). 
  
1The rector magnificus in the Austrian, as in the German universities—in opposi- 
tion to the Russian universities, where he is appointed for an indefinite time, and 
like the American university president—is elected from the number of the professores 
ordinarii or emeriti for one year from each faculty alternately by a body of the pro- 
fessors (4 from each faculty) under the parting rector as chairman.

Among the 73 hospitants (students not having the gymnasial certifi- 
cate of maturity) there are 40 students of pharmacy. 
The law faculty of the university is composed of 15 professors and 5 
privat-docenten. The circle of studies contains the various aspects 
of the Pandects (Roman law) taught by 3 professors, German law, 
Catholic church law, philosophy of law, international law, encyclopedia 
of law and the political sciences, Austrian private law, Austrian penal 
law and equity pleading (in Polish and Ruthenian), political economy 
by 2 professors, Austrian civil law, Austrian banking law, Austrian 
statistics with a reference to the neighboring European States, commer- 
cial law, economic administration of Galicia, Polish private law and 
pleading, Austrian political law, science of political accounts in the 
Austro-Slavonic countries. 
One of the most remarkable and beneficial features of the Lemberg 
law faculty are the numerous juridical seminaries, conducted by the 
most eminent professors: The seminary of administrative and political 
sciences, the seminaries of German international law, of Polish law, 
of canon law, of penology, of Roman law, and the seminary of political 
economy. 
The philosophical faculty consists of 21 professors, 11 privat-docenten, 
3 docenten, and 3 instructors in modern languages (analogous to the 
lectores of the German and Russian universities). 
In the philosophical department proper the following branches were 
taught in the last summer semester: Logic with regard to the needs of 
the candidates for the middle or secondary schools (szk6t Srednich) ; 
elucidation of John Stuart Mill’s Utilitarianism; methodology of the 
mathematical and cognate sciences; on the task and method of aca- 
demic studies; introduction to the history of philosophy. 
In the department of history and its auxiliary sciences, extensive 
studies in Austrian, Polish, classical, and universal history were con- 
ducted: The history of the Austrian State from the beginning of the 
Thirty Years’ war to the close of the Karlowitz peace (1618-1699); his- 
tory of the Slavonic peoples and states within the Austro-Hungarian
-P-A-G-E-838

Monarchy; history of Poland and Lithuania in the fifteenth and six- 
teenth centuries; Polish diplomatics; survey of the history from the 
downfall of the Roman Empire to the thirteenth century; Italy at the 
time of the Renaissance; modern history; history of the pragmatic 
sanction; Raphael’s life and works; history of Polish art in the nine- 
teenth century. Two historic seminaries supply practical exercises for 
historical investigations. A full chair for the study of geography is 
provided. 
The department of philology and literature has a classical and a 
modern division. The curriculum of studies is excellent and complete. 
The classics have had such an old citizenship in Poland that the 
standard of classical studies in the University of Lemberg can be 
stated as simply the highest possible. A philological seminary and 
proseminary aids in the very best training of the students in classics. 
In the modern division, Polish and Slavonic literature are naturally 
theforemost. But the German language is also excellently represented ; 
the history of German literature was studied last summer, and in the 
middle high German division of the Germanic Seminary Gudrun was 
treated. Unfortunately there is no scientific treatment (in the univer- 
sity sense) of English philology and the Romance languages, the former 
being represented only by one instructor (nauczyciel) twice a week, 
the latter by one instructor five times a week. Polish and German 
stenography are also taught. 
The Slavonic studies are so much the better represented in the fol- 
lowing courses: History of Polish literature from the second half of the 
tenth to the end of the fifteenth century, seminary exercises in the 
history of Polish literature, scientific Polish grammar, an elementary 
course in Old Slavonian, reading and interpretation of Servian poets. 
There are courses also in the history of Russian literature from 1709 
to 1848, Old Slavonian and Russian language, seminary practice in 
Russian philology, which are conducted in Ruthenian. 
Equally good and complete is the department of the mathematical 
and cognate sciences, with the following courses: Optics, thermody- 
nainics, physics, electricity, magnetism, all branches of higher mathe- 
matics (with two mathematical seminaries), mineralogy, geology, geology 
of the Carpathian Mountains, botany, chemistry, pharmacognostics, 
ete. All these various scientific studies are properly aided by cor- 
responding laboratories and museums: The physical museum, the 
meteorological observatory, the chemical laboratory (with a complete 
scientific apparatus), the mineralogical museum, the botanical museum 
and laboratory (with herbaria and collections), a botanical garden, a 
zoological museum, a pharmacognostic collection, an anatomical and 
physiological collection. More than 7,000 florins are spent on these 
laboratories every year. The course in pharmacy is usually completed 
in two years in scientific education and laboratory work in the botani- 
eal, chemical, and pharmaceutal laboratories.

The university library was founded at the same time as the univer- 
sity. The Garelli library, containing about 11,000 volumes, which was 
combined with various libraries of abolished Jesuit colleges after the 
suppression of the Theresian Academy in Vienna, formed the original 
stock of the Lemberg University library. It contained at the end of 
1892, 120,900 volumes, 396 manuscripts, 241 documents, and 10,657 coins 
and medals. The financial support of the library amounts to 18,073 
florins a year for salaries and purchase of new books. 
This valuable library is fully described in Karl Reifenkugel’s work, 
Biblioteka uniwersitecka we Lwowie, in the magazine Przewodnik nau- 
kowy iliteracki. Lemberg 1873. 
Count Ossolinski Library.—Besides the university library and as a sup- 
plement for the documentary study of Polish history, there is in Lem- 
berg another great library of paramount importance, which is exceed- 
ingly rich in manuscripts and early printed Slavonic books; it is the 
Count Ossolitiski National Institute (Zaklad narodowy imienia Osso- 
liiskich). It was founded in 1817 by Joseph Maximilian Count of 
Tenczyn and opened to the public in 1826. The aim of this beneficial 
institute is the collection of printed works, manuscripts, pictures, en- 
gravings, etc., and of antiquities of Polish origin, the publication of 
manuscripts and important works in its own printing office, aid to poor 
deserving Polish students, and the maintenance of a public reading hall. 
There are in the library 91,400 printed volumes (besides 8,640 dupli- 
cates), 3,496 manuscripts, 1,168 documents, 2,810 autographs, 25,240 
engravings, 856 pictures, 2,200 museum objects, 670 weapons, 1,880 
maps and charts, 18,100 coins, and 4,237 medals. The report of 1895 
gives 93,550 books (besides 8,740 duplicates), 3,601 MSS., 1,174 docu- 
ments, 2,851 autographs, 25,511 engravings, 866 pictures, 2,237 museum 
objects, 670 weapons, 1,892 maps, 18,100 coins, and 4,237 medals. 
Among the many publications on the treasures of the Ossoliriski 
Library perhaps the most important are: Biblioteka Ossoliriskich, 
Zbiér materiatow do historyi polskiej (collection of material for Polish 
history), Lwow, 1874 ff.; Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Biblio- 
thece Ossoliniane Leopoliensis, Tom. I, II, III (still appearing). The 
institute had, in 1893, a fortune of 545,000 florins. The expenses were 
17,780 florins. The Polish magnate, Prince Andreas Lubomirski, is the 
present curator of the institute. 
Archives for the Grod and Terrestral Court Documents of Poland.— 
These archives, founded in 1878 as a State institute, afford an indispen- 
sable mine of information to the student on the old Polish town and 
country court institutions and the forensic conditions of Galicia in gen- 
eral. It contains the documents of the ancient grod and terrestral 
courts of the palatinates of Reussen, Cracow-Sandomir, and Belz and 
the starostaships of Oswiecin (Auschwitz) and Zator for the years 
1409-1785, 
The appropriation for the archives in 1894 was 6,000 florins.

The Imperial Royal School of Technology in Lemberg.—tIn the same 
year that the University of Lemberg was reorganized (1817) the first 
real school (Realschule) of Galicia was erected and thus a new stimulus 
given to the technical sciences. The school developed so that in 1835 
a separation of the technical and commercial branches could take place. 
In 1843 this real and commercial academy was extended by a technical 
course, out of which gradually an academy of technology grewup. In 
1846, when the Republic of Cracow was conquered by Austria, the 
institute of technology of that city soon outreached that of Lemberg, 
which lost in importance. 
In 1871 the Polish language was introduced officially and the academy 
was built up as a school of technology (with the rank of a university) 
by the founding of new chairs. The regulations of 1872 put it on an 
equal footing with the other Technische Hochschulen in Austria, like 
Graz, Briinn, Vienna, Budapest, Prague (German and Czech). 
The technical high school of Lemberg, like all the other Austrian 
high scheols, consists of four professional schools—i. e., the school 
of engineering, of architecture, of mechanical engineering, and the 
chemico-technological school. The course in the schools of engineering 
and architecture requires five years, that in the other two schools four 
years. Regular students must have the certificate of maturity from a 
secondary (middle) school or a gymnasium, in which latter case they 
have to give sufficient proof of efficiency in geometry and free-hand 
drawing. Hospitants must be 18 years of age and give sufficient proof 
of their ability to follow the courses. 
The administration of the institute in 1892 was carried on at an 
expense of 101,900 florins; in 1893, 105,648 florins, toward which the 
State had to contribute 100,975 florins; in 1895, 113,264 florins (107,445 
florins Government contribution). In the same year there were 188 reg- 
ular students and 12 hospitants in the school, and in 1895 227 students 
and 34 hospitants. 
The instruction in these four branches is given by most eminent pro- 
fessors in all the technical branches usually taught in such schools, 
besides studies specially adapted to an Austrian school of technology, 
as, for instance, a course in taxation of whisky, beer, sugar, and mineral 
oils, encyclopedia of the science of forestry, Austrian political economy, 
and commercial and banking law. There are in the institution 19 pro- 
fessors, 9 honorary docenten, 11 privat-docenten, 1 lector in German 
philology, and 3 teachers in French, English, and water-color painting, 
respectively. 
The school has a laboratory for general chemistry (yearly appropria- 
tion, 900 florins; extra allowance, 200 florins), a laboratory for chemical 
technology (yearly appropriation, 900 florins; extra allowance, 200
-P-A-G-E-841

florins), a physical cabinet (600 florins), a technological cabinet (600 
florins), an electro-technical institute (500 florins), a mineralogico- 
geological collection (400 florins), a os of natural historic objects 
(210 florins), an observatory for higher geodesy and spheric astronomy 
(200 florins), collections of apparatus for mechanical engineering (700 
florins), practical geometry (600 florins), architecture (Hochbau) (500 
florins), engineering sciences (500 florins), mechanics (315 florins), street 
and water works, hydraulics (250 atta ornamental drawing (120 
florins), descriptive geometry (100 florins), knowledge of articles of 
merchandise (100 florins). A good technical library under the super- 
vision of a full professor, and with an allowed expenditure of 4,960 
florins, exclusive of fees (245 florins in 1891-92; respectively, 5,360 and 
420 florins, in 1895), is attached to the Lemberg technical high school. 
Five gymnasia, I real school, 1 Roman Catholic, and 1 Ruthenian- 
Catholic seminary in Lemberg (Liw6w), complete the educational facili- 
ties of the present capital of Austrian Poland. According to the 
Jahrbuch des héheren Unterrichtswesens in Oesterreich of 1893, the 
status of the Lemberg secondary schools was as follows: 
The imperial academic state gymnasium, with the Ruthenian lan- 
guage, dates back to the fourteenth century. It obtained its name 
“gymnasium academicum” in the first half of the eighteenth century; 
theological and philosophical courses were given at the school, but after 
the foundation of the Lemberg University (1784 and again in 1817) 
were transferred to the latter institution. By imperial order of May 31, 
1873, Ruthenian was introduced as the official language. Five hun- 
dred and eight pupils were in attendance in 1893 in 8 classes. The 
second State gymnasium, with 467 pupils, founded in 1818, is German. 
The Francis Joseph state gymnasium, the fourth and fifth state gym- 
nasia, founded in 1858, 1879, and 1892, with 624, 736, and 573 pupils, 
respectively, are thoroughly Polish, and show the growth of the Polish 
population and its educational proclivities. z 
The imperial state real school of Lemberg, founded in 1857, enlarged 
in 1872, has 430 pupils. 
There is in Lemberg a State teachers’ seminary with 150 male can- 
didates and 62 male pupils in its preparatory class, and a similar insti- 
tution for females with 204 candidates, and 80 pupils in the department 
for kindergarten education. Both Polish and Ruthenian are official 
languages. 
One industrial school with Polish as the official language, and with 
the departments of architecture and industrial art, with trade schools 
in cabinetmaking, turning, artistic embroidery, decorative designing 
and drawing in an open drawing-room for women, and an industrial 
workshop help to complete the round of useful! studies. 
Secondary schools in Galicia.—Secondary schools are freely spread 
over the whole country to serve as feeders for the two Polish universi- 
ties and the school of technology. Most of them are governmental
-P-A-G-E-842
  784 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
schools, and the few which are not, are under the supervision of the 
provincial school authorities and the minister of public instruction in 
Vienna, so as to insure the same high standard of scholarship which 
has to be reached in the imperial or state gymnasia and real gymnasia, 
The curriculum of all is, mutatis mutandis, equal to that of the other 
schools of equal grade in the monarchy, only all branches are taught in 
the Polish language by national teachers, thus propagating and increas- 
ing a specifically Polish culture, which makes this great province one 
of the most precious jewels in the crown of Austria-Hungary. 
The following secondary schools in Galicia with Polish as the official 
language! may be mentioned: 
The state gymnasium at Bochnia, with 365 pupils; founded in 1817. 
The administration and instruction is conducted by 1 director, 12 pro- 
fessors, and 6 associates (supplenten), about the usual number of the 
teaching force of such schools. All these officers are regular graduates 
of Austrian universities provided with their special facultas docendi. 
The state gymnasium at Brzezany, with 382 pupils; founded in 1805; 
completed in 1863. 
The under gymnasium of Buczacz under the Basilian Brothers; 
founded in 1754 by tke starosta, Count Nicolaus Potocki, with 346. 
pupils. 
The private gymnasium of the Jesuits at Bakowice, near Chyréw, 
originated from the old convict school of the Jesuit Society at Tarnopol. 
The school, with its 8 classes and 306 pupils, has, under the ministerial 
decree of December 28, 1891, all the rights and privileges of a state 
gymnasium. 
The Francis Joseph state gymnasium at Drohobyez, founded in 1858 
as a communal school, taken under state control in 1874, the community 
granting it annually 18,000 florins, has 347 pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Jaroslau, opened in 1868 as communal 
school, taken under state control by imperial decree in 1872, has 401 
pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Jaslo, founded in 1868 as communal school, 
since 1875 administered by the state. The community takes charge of 
the building, heating material, and service, and pays an annual contri- 
bution of 500 florins. It has 496 pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Kotomea, founded in 1861 as a communal 
under gymnasium. Since 1878 it has been a full gymnasium, with 
obligatory drawing in the lower classes. -In 1892 the first parallel 
class with Ruthenian as official language was opened. It has 569 
pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Podgérze, opened on September 5, 1892, 
with 2 classes and 113 pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Przemysl originated in the Jesuit college 
founded in 1617. After the suppression of the order it received secular

teachers in 1773. The philosophical institute, opened in 1820, was 
combined with the gymnasium in 1849. With the scholastic year 
1888-89 the first parallel class with Ruthenian was opened by imperial 
decree of July 29, 1887. There are 564 pupils in the Polish and 218 in 
the 5 Ruthenian parallel classes; together, 782. 
The state gymnasium at Rzesséw, completed in 1858, has 605 pupils. 
The Archduchess Elizabeth state gymnasium at Sambor existed as 
a Jesuit gymnasium from 1680 to the suppression of the order; was 
supported by the community from 1792 to 1815; since 1815 has been 
a state gymnasium; has had its complete 8 classes since 1853; 469 
pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Novy-Sandec, founded in 1818 with 6 classes, 
was transferred to the Jesuits in 1839, provided with secular teachers 
in 1849, completed in 1866, The community pays annually 1,680 florins 
toward its support. It has 279 pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Sanok was opened in 1881 with 2 classes; 
supported entirely by the community; it has 291 pupils. 
‘he state gymnasium at Stanislau, founded as Jesuit gymnasium in 
the eighteenth century; it has 627 pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Stryj, subventioned by the city with 5,000 
florins; it has 342 pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Tarnopol, established as a Jesuit gymnasium 
in 1820; with a philosophical institute in 1821; organized in 1850 as a 
full gymnasium with secular teachers; has 472 pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Tarndéw, established in 1784; complete since 
1849; has 551 pupils. 
The state gymnasium at Wadowice, complete siz.ce 1878, with obliga- 
tory drawing in the lower classes; has 269 pupils. 
The state gymnasium ai Ztoezéw, completes. in 1881; subventioned 
by the city with 4,000 florins and all the necessary material; it has 296 
pupils. 
Two real schools (Realschulen) at Stanislau and Tarnopol, and the 
teachers’ seminaries (normal schools) at Rzeszéw (202 candidates), 
Sambor (Polish and Ruthenian, with 142 candidates), Stanislau (Polish 
and Ruthenian, with 195 candidates), Tarnopol (Polish and Ruthenian, 
with 197 candidates), Tarndéw (165 candidates), and Przemysl (with 115 
female candidates) contribute to furnish the country with good primary 
teachers. 
Higher female schools have not yet obtained full and due appreciation, 
yet good private and convent schools contribute largely to a high intel- 
lJectual and moral education of women in Galicia. 
EDUCATION IN THE ANCIENT POLISH PROVINCES OF PRUSSIA. 
In the official Jahresberichte iiber das héhere Schulwesen in Preussen, 
by Conrad Rethwisch, Berlin, 1893, no instruction or education in the 
Polish language is mentioned, at least so far as the secondary schools
-P-A-G-E-844
  786 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
in Prussia are concerned. But the solution of the Polish linguistic and 
educational problem is not yet entirely accomplished. It still exists in 
three provinces of the Kingdom of Prussia, in the province of Prussia 
(proper), Posen, and Silesia. 
Eyer since Adalbert, Bishop of Prague, went to preach the gospel 
to Prussia, about the year 997, Pruzzia, as called by his companion 
Gaudentius, because it was inhabited by the Bor-Russians (Bordering- 
on-Russia), a fierce, warlike tribe closely related with the Letts and 
Lithuanians, this country was the Eris apple of the surrounding Ger- 
man and Slavonic powers. King Knut of Denmark and the Polish 
dukes, the Grand Masters of the Teutonic Order and the Polish kings, 
the Hohenzollern dukes, and later the Electors stamped their character 
and nationality upon the country, as St. Adalbert—according to Car- 
lyle—“has stamped his life upon it, in the form of a crucifix.” Thus 
its inhabitants are, according to their descent and language, Lithua- 
nians or Letts, Masurs, Kures, Kassubes, but mostly Poles and Germans, 
the latter strongly mixed with Swiss and Palatine emigrants and colo- 
nists, French Huguenot refugees, so liberally received by the Great 
Elector, and Salzburg exiles, driven out by their archbishop. The 
Massurs live in the southern part of the government districts of Gum- 
binnen, Kénigsberg, and Marienwerder, and are unmixed Slavs as well 
as the Kassubes. : 
But this whole population, so long under the superior, leveling influ- 
ence of Prussia, has been welded together, with the exception of 
the two Slavonic constituents, into one pseudo-German element, of 
course the purely German majority itself excepted. But the province 
of West Prussia, formed in 1878 for administrative reasons, contains 
still a Polish population, amounting to one-third of the entire popala- 
tion, among whom the Polish language is still cultivated and has a 
secondary place beside German in the schools. But a glance at the 
network of the most excellent German schools of all descriptions proves 
that this province is in Germanism equal to any other Prussian proy- 
ince beyond the Elbe. 
“This acquisition [i.e., the share taken by Prussia in 1772],” says 
Frederick the Great somewhere in his memoirs, “was one of the most 
important we could make, because it joined Pommerania to East 
Prussia (ours for ages past), and, since it rendered us masters of the 
Weichsel River, we gained the double advantage of being able to 
defend that Kingdom (Ost-Preussen), and to draw considerable tolls 
from the Weichsel, as all the trade of Poland goes by that river.” 
Carlyle puts the adequate question, What became of West Preussen 
under Friedrich? and Gustav Freytag responds, not an impartial wit- 
ness toward Poland, but in this case history corroborates his statement:! 
Acquisition of Polish Prussia.—Frederick was the first conqueror who once more 
pushed forward the German frontier toward the East, reminding the Germans 
'G. Freytag, Neue Bilder aus dem Leben des deutschen Volkes, Leipzig.  
-P-A-G-E-845
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 187 
again that it was their task to carry law, culture, liberty, and industry into the 
east of Europe. All Frederick’s lands, with the exception only of some Old Saxon 
territory, had, by force and colonization, been painfully gained from the Slav. At 
no time since the migrations of the middle ages had this struggle for possession of 
tho wide plains to the east of the Oder ceased. When arms were at rest, politicians 
carried on the struggle. 
In what state Frederick found the Polish Provinces.—Some few only of the larger 
German towns, which were secured by walls, and some protected districts inhabited 
exclusively by Germans, as the Niederung, near Dantzig, the villages under the mild 
rule of the Cistercians of Oliva, and the opulent German towns of Catholic Ermeland, 
were in tolerable circumstances. The other towns lay in ruins, so also most of the 
hamlets (Hife) of the open country. Bromberg, the city of German colonists 
(founded by the Teutonic Order, but entirely Polonized), the Prussians found in 
heaps and ruins. No historian, no document, tells of the destruction and slaughter 
that had been going on in the whole district of the Netze there during the last ten 
years before the arrival of the Prussians. * * * The country people hardly knew 
such a thing as bread; many had never in their lives tasted such a delicacy; few 
villages possessed an oven. * * * 
The peasant noble (unvoting, inferior kind) was hardly different from the com- 
mon peasant; he himself guided his hook plow (hacken-pflug), and clattered with 
his wooden slippers upon the plankless floor of his hut. It was a desolate land, 
without discipline; without law, without a master. On 9,000 English square miles 
lived 500,000 souls, not 55 to the square mile. 
Gustav Freytag is doubtless right about the then condition of that 
section of Poland. Mr. W. A. Day, in his above-mentioned Russian 
Government in Poland, pages 134-135, corroborates the statement. 
But Freytag is wrong when he puts all the blame upon the Polish 
government, administration, and necessary national character. The 
counter picture of what Germany, and Brandenburg in particular, was 
after the thirty-years war, and the fact that the Great Elector preceded 
the Great King in raising her people from absolute brutality, might 
have enabled the great novelist-historian to seek for the causes of 
desolation somewhere else. 
Frederick sets to work.—The very rottenness of the country became an attraction 
for Frederick; and henceforth West Prussia was, what hitherto Silesia had been, his 
favorite child, which, with infinite care, like that of an anxious, loving mother, he 
washed, brushed, new dressed, and forced to go to school and into orderly habits, 
and kept ever in his eye. The diplomatic squabbles about this “acquisition” were 
still going on when he had sent a body of his best officials into this waste, howling 
scene to set about organizing it. The Landschaften (counties) were divided into 
small circles (Kreise); * * * new parishes, each with its church and parson, 
were called into existence as by miracle; a company of 187 schoolmasters, partly 
selected and trained by the excellent Semler, were sent into the country; multitudes 
of German mechanics, too, from brick makers up to machine builders. Everywhere 
there began a digging, a hammering, a building; cities were peopled anew, street 
after street rose out of the heaps of ruins, new villages of colonists were laid out, 
new modes of agriculture ordered. The great canal was dug which connects, by the 
Netze River, the Weichsel with the Oder and the Elbe. * * * And when Goethe, 
himself now become an old man, finished his Faust, the figure of the old King again 
rose on him and stepped into his poem, and his Faust became transformed into an 
unresting, creating, pitilessly exacting master, forcing on his salutiferous drains and 
fruitful canals through the morasses of the Vistula.
-P-A-G-E-846
  
  7188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
So far Freytag’s description of the fact is essentially true and cor- 
rect. Education, which was raised and increased by degrees from that 
time on, is materially a Prussian, i. e., a German, creation in those 
regions. 
It was not, therefore, simply as a conqueror that Prussia came. 
Frederick believed that his “share” was necessary for her security, but 
it must be humanized and strengthened; its people must be educated— 
it was but natural with him and his successors that they must be edu- 
cated in German. In villages the most remote, schools were introduced 
and churches rebuilt and endowed; Polish-speaking teachers were sent 
to the western provinces, where they could make no use of the Polish 
language and would even forget it; German teachers who knew no 
Polish whatever were sent to the east to teach in German exclusively, 
which they did frequently not to much advantage. Yet the ‘noiseless 
Germanization” of the old Polish provinces ever went on. 
Meanwhile the originally Polish population became more conscious 
of its nationality, owing toits better educational equipment. A Polish 
nobility of the highest order of education and culture arose to culti- 
vate the treasures of their old civilization. It can be safely stated that 
there is no Prussian subject of Polish nationality who objects to learn- 
ing and mastering the German language. Only when there was coer- 
cion to unlearn Polish did a strong reaction take place against it from 
all strata of Polish society. Everybody knows and values German, but 
wants to be free to speak the language of his fathers at home, in the 
church, and in the school, at least for religious instruction. Although 
the point how far to concede the latter privilege is still a matter of 
controversy, forbearance and toleration is the present principle of the 
Prussian policy, and in consequence the representatives of the Polish 
population in Prussia are faithful supporters of the Government, loyal 
adherents to the monarchy and its enlightened dynasty. In the army, 
‘in the civil service, in all professional and practical pursuits, there are 
thousands of Poles in distinguished, frequently the most elevated, 
positions. A difference or discrimination exists ne longer. 
The primary-school controversy, how much Polish shall be taught 
in the elementary schools of the Polish-Prussian provinces, whether in 
religion alone, which can be felt and understood by the child only in 
the mother language, or also in other branches of instruction, has not 
subsided yet. Some sharp contrasts of opinion are yet existing, but 
the conciliatory, natural, tolerant opinion prevails, counting among its 
supporters men like Professor Delbriick, of the University of Berlin, 
editor of the influential Preussische Jahrbiicher. Although Polish is 
still an important element in the eastern social life of Prussia, owing to 
a highly cultured nobility and an excellently educated ‘“ bourgeoisie,” 
still it has no longer a preponderating influence. 
But so much may be safely maintained: that the Polish language in 
Prussia will not die out and its literature will not be forgotten, since
-P-A-G-E-847

the unique German universities develop it into an integral constituent 
of their Slavonic departments, and since more and more young men are 
taking up Slavonic studies in order to investigate, search, and complete 
the round of the Indo-European languages, literatures, and histories. 
Polish origin of the University of Koenigsberg.—The University of 
Koenigsberg, which to-day is so absolutely German that the Polish 
seminary under H. Pelka and the Lithuanian seminary under M. 
Lackner are the only traces of its past, is more closely related with 
the history of Polish culture than is generally assumed. It was estab- 
lished in 1544 as Collegium Albertinum by Albert, Duke of Prussia, 
first cousin to King Sigismund Augustus, with the object of promoting 
religious, literary, and scientific culture among the German, Polish, 
and Lithuanian populations which inhabited the dominions of Prussia. 
Indeed, the university contributed much to the spread of Scriptural 
knowledge in Poland. The first Polish gospel and the first Protestant 
works in that language appeared under the auspices of this institution. 
More than that, the university obtained its consecration and baptism 
from Poland. 
At a time when the privilege of the Pope, or his worldly represent- 
ative, the Emperor, seemed indispensable to the foundation of a uni- 
versity, the first rector of Koenigsberg, Sabinus, applied to Cardinal 
Bembo to obtain, by his instrumentality, from the Pope, a charter for 
a university established with the avowed purpose of opposing his 
authority. Of course this request was declined by Bembo, and like- 
wise by the Emperor. But Sigismund Augustus, King of Poland, 
although a Catholic monarch, granted to the Protestant university of 
Koenigsberg a charter, proprio motu datum, Wilno, March 28, 1561, 
He expresses by the above-mentioned charter that he was founding by 
it the said university (universitatem condidimus et ereximus), to which 
he gave equal rights with that of Cracow. This charter for the erec- 
tion of a Protestant university was—in honor of Polish toleration be it 
mentioned—countersigned by Padniewski, vice-chancellor of Poland 
and Roman Catholic bishop of Przemysl. When the privileges of that 
university were confirmed by Wladislaw IV, King of Poland, the act 
of confirmation was likewise countersigned by the vice-chancellor, Gem- 
bicki, also a Catholic prelate. The Polish monarch had an opportunity 
of exercising his supremacy as liege lord of Prussia in a manner bene- 
ficial to the privileges of the University of Koenigsberg in 1617. The 
Duke of Prussia, having appropriated to himself the right of nomi- 
nating professors, which was vested in the university by its charter, 
the affair was referred to the King of Poland, whose commissaries 
decided in favor of the university. 
The prime object of the theological faculty of the university was to 
train ministers fit to expound the word of God to the Polish and 
Lithuanian populations of Prussia in their national languages. Here- 
tofore a translator was always standing near the pulpit, who translated
-P-A-G-E-848
    790 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894795. ~ 
to the congregation the German sermon, unintelligible to most of the 
Poles and Lithuanians. The theological seminary established at the 
university contained 24 students, 14 of whom were for the Polish and 
Lithuanian languages. In 1425 a separate seminary was established 
for the Poles and Lithuanians of Prussia, besides a foundation made 
by the Princes Radziwill for Protestant scholars from Poland and 
Lithuania.! 
The Lyceum Hosianum; secondary schools in Prussia.—The Lyceum 
Hosianum at Braunsberg, so called after the celebrated Cardinal 
Stanislaus Hosius, which at present is absolutely Germanized, is of . 
thoroughly Polish origin. An adversary of the Reformation, Hosius, 
as bishop of Warmia, founded in 1568 the Jesuit college at Braunsberg, 
asa means for the suppression of the reformatory movement in Poland. 
The school became an episcopal seminary for the training of priests. 
After its destruction by the French in 1807 it was rebuilt, and by royal 
decree of May 19, 1818, was raised to a Catholic theological and 
philosophical faculty, and endowed by the secularized estates of the 
monastery of Neuzelle, near Frankfort on the Oder. At present, how- 
ever, not a trace of its Polish origin is left. 
The great number of excellent schools in the province shows that 
the Prussian Government neglects nothing to raise the standard of 
culture in the two provinces to a height never reached before: 
There is a royal academy of fine arts at Koenigsberg, 16 gymnasia, 
2 progymnasia, 6 real schools, 2 real progymnasia, 1 higher Biirger- 
schule (high school), 12 public high schools for girls, 8 middle schools 
for boys, 8 teachers’ seminaries (male), 2 royal and 10 private prepara- 
tory schools for the latter, 2 schools of navigation, 2 schools of mid- 
wifery, 1 trade and 1 architectural school, the agricultural institute 
* connected with the university, 2 (secondary) agricultural schools, and 
7 lower agricultural schools, beside 4 schools for the deaf and dumb 
and 1 for the blind. Only here and there a little Polish is taught as a 
facultative branch, but otherwise the Germanization has been absolute 
and complete. 
Libraries: Two cities in West Prussia are especially notable for their 
libraries—Danzig and Elbing. 
The city library of Danzig was founded in 1591 by the donation of 
Giovanni Bonifacio Marchese d’Oria and increased by later purchases, 
donations, and legacies. It is especially rich in local, Polish, and Ger- 
man history, geography, literature, art history, and political economy. 
Tt contains about 70,000 volumes, among which there are 446 incuna- 
bula and 1,182 manuscripts. The library is especially rich in Polonica, 
relating to the history of Poland and her relation with Prussia. The 
first volume of a catalogue of the library relating to the manuscripts 
concerning Dantsic was published by A. Bertling, 1892. 
The Danzig city archives, besides those of Liibeck, the richest city   
1Vide Arnold’s Geschichte der Universitiit Kénigsberg.
-P-A-G-E-849
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN POLAND. 791 
archives in North Germany, were arranged anew in 1850, by order of 
the Danzig city magistracy, for the public service and scientific use. 
They contain four chief departments: (1) The archive library, contain- 
ing mostly manuscripts and chronicles, but few printed works; (2) the 
library of maps and plans, containing the oldest maps and views of 
the city and its territory; (3) the great collection of historical records 
and documents, most of them of the greatest historical value—the 
books of the national delegates, sent to diets and other missions, from 
1420, the acta internunciorum from 1515 on, the records of the Hansa 
and the Prussian States; (4) the collection of documents, containing 
more than 50,000 numbers, the oldest from 1253. 
The city library of Elbing, founded in 1601, increased in 1710 by 
manuscripts and incunabula from the Dominican monastery at Elbing 
after its suppression, contains about 27,000 volumes, 121 incunabula, 
205 manuseripts, and 770 maps and engravings. The library is well 
catalogued. 
The Province of Posen.—The Grand Duchy or Province of Posen has 
a population which is mostly Polish by descent and language, especially 
preponderating in the southeast of the province; but the German ele- 
ment is strongly represented, especially in the cities and towns, and 
is steadily progressing. Education is almost exclusively in German 
hands, though Polish is studied almost everywhere in the primary and 
secondary schools and from the pulpit. 
There is no university in this province, owing to the close neighbor- 
hood of Keenigsberg, Berlin, and Breslau, but a network of excellent 
secondary schools is spread over the country. 
There are 14 gymnasia, 2 progymnasia, 4 real schools, 13 middle 
schools, various high schools for girls, 5 teachers’ seminaries (male), 4 
royal preparatory schools for the latter, 1 (female) teachers’ seminary, 
2,187 public primary schools, 3 institutes for the deaf and dumb, 1 for 
the blind. Nevertheless public education stands lower in Posen than 
in any other Prussian province, sending the highest percentage of 
analphabets to the army, 8.55 per cent in 1884-85, 
At the head of the Polish Roman Catholic clergy stands the Arch- 
bishop of Posen-Gnesen, now himself a Pole, under whom are the 
metropolitan chapters at Gnesen and Posen, the archpriesthoods, the 
collegiate abbeys and cloisters. 
Among the finest buildings of the city of Posen, dating back to 
Polish times, are the city hall, built in 1580, Slavonic-Roman style, with 
a beautiful tower, built in 1730, and a rich collection of books; the 
palace, decorated with a magnificent frontage, with 24 Corinthian pillars, 
donated by Count Raczynski; the Dzyalinski palace, with a rich collec- 
tion of Polish documents; and the palace of the archbishop, with a 
large gallery of precious pictures and works of art, partly referring to 
Polish history. The city of Posen has 24 Catholic and 3 Protestant 
churches, among which the cathedral, built in Gothic style in 1775, is
-P-A-G-E-850
  192 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the most significant. It contains valuable fresco paintings, numerous 
monuments and tombs, and the so-called golden chapel, which Count 
Raczynski, with some other Polish nobles, built in 1842 in Byzantine 
style and adorned with many works of art, especially the gilded brass 
monuments of the first Polish kings, Mieczyslaw and Boleslaw, exe- 
cuted by Rauch, the famous sculptor of the tomb of Queen Louise of 
Prussia. 
The city is amply provided with excellent schools, namely, 1 real 
gymnasium, the building of which is an architectural ornament of the 
city; 2 gymnasia, partly with Polish instruction; 1 (female) teachers’ 
seminary, 1 girls’ high school, several boys’ high schools, and a school 
of midwifery. 
Posen, besides Gnesen, is one of the oldest Polish cities, and is still a 
center of Polish culture, education, and the seat of the Polish book trade 
in Prussia. After his conversion to Christianity, King Mieczyslaw 
founded here a bishopric in 996. By its trade with Germany the city 
became very flourishing and the seat of a “ woiew6 dstwo” (military gov- 
ernorship). The work of Lukaszewiez, Obraz historiczno-statystytezny 
miasta Poznania, Posen, 1838 (German translation in 1881), gives a 
fair picture of such an old boundary town between the Germanic and 
Slavonic domain, its culture, struggles, aspirations, influence, life, and 
thought. No German author has from a German standpoint so finely 
defined the contrast between Slavonic and Teutonic life as Gustav 
Freytag, to repeat an earlier statement, has done in his Credit and 
Debit, and especially in his classical historical novels, Die Ahnen and 
Bilder aus der Deutschen Vergangenheit. 
Libraries: The capital of the Grand Duchy of Posen has two impor- 
tant libraries, with a large stock of books and documents relating to 
Polish history, literature, education, and political conditions. 
The family library of the counts of Raezynski was bequeathed as an 
eternal, particular property to the city of Posen on February 22, 1829, 
together with the newly built library building and an endowment of 
189,500 marks. It contains 50,000 volumes (189 incunabula), 360 manu- 
scripts, and 230 documents. The allowance for yearly expenditures 
is 4,600 marks. The library is well catalogued in 4 volumes by M. 5. 
Sosnowski and L. Kurtzmann. 
Besides the Raczynski library, the royal State archives in Posen 
have a large stock of Polish historical and court documents; about 
3,000 documents from 1153-1793, Acta from 1793 on, grod books from 
1386-1793; collections from the western and south Prussian times; 
also the very important and unique city archives of Posen, Gnesen, and 
Fraustadt, which do now and will for a long time furnish rich sources 
for the investigation of Poland and her relations to the surrounding 
neighbors, as well as for her standard of culture and civilization.

CHAPTER XVI. 
ART EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Inasmuch as the true industrial education is art education, the prog- 
ress of the common schools in introducing instruction calculated to 
cultivate the taste of the pupils for genuine works of art is of great 
significance. The invention of new machinery is gradually driving 
out the drudgery of work by hand. More and more persons are labor- 
ing with the brain and fewer with the mere hand. With the increase 
of production by machinery more individuals in the community can be 
spared for those vocations which add ornament to goods. Fewer per- 
sons are needed to gather the raw material, more are needed to manu- 
facture it into articles of luxury and ornament. Those nations whose 
workmen display the highest order of taste in the finish of their goods 
hold the markets of the world and increase more rapidly in wealth. 
Philadelphia, in proportion to its size, has a larger manufacturing pop- 
ulation than any other city in the United States. It is interesting to 
note that by the generous benefaction of Drexel one of the best insti- 
tutions for education in art has been founded. Dr. James MacAlister, 
the president of Drexel Institute, read the following paper at the 
annual meeting of the department of superintendence of the National 
Educational Association. In the light of the future of art education 
this address is of great significance: 
ART EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
By James MacAuisrer, LL. D., President Drewel Institute of Art, Science, and Industry. 
The social development of the last half century shows a steady 
growth in the recognition of the public school as one of the most 
important institutions of modern society. To the thoughtful man the 
future presents a number of social problems of the gravest import. 
Individual freedom from class and proscriptive tyranny has, in a broad 
sense, been secured. Public opinion, the aggregate of the majority 
of individual opinions, has become the sole basis of social order, and 
hence the binding force in modern society in what the majority of the 
people think or believe. We need to bring the full significance of this 
fact before us, and to consider that under this social dispensation all 
the baser elements of human nature are given as free play as are the 
higher elements, and that no man is restricted in his personal liberty 
793

until he encroaches upon the liberties of others, before we can ade- 
quately comprehend the supreme importance of public education to the 
modern state. 
John Fiske made a valuable contribution to education, as well as to 
the doctrine of evolution, when he pointed out the meaning of infancy. 
In his suggestive treatment of this subject he asks this question: 
What is the meaning of the fact that man is born into the world more helpless 
than any other creature, and needs, for a much longer season than any other living 
thing, the tender care and wise counsel of his elders? It is one of the most familiar 
of facts that man, alone among animals, exhibits a capacity for progress. That man 
is widely different from other animals in the length of his adolescence and the utter 
helplessness of his babyhood is an equally familiar thing. Now, between these two 
commonplace facts is there no connection? Is it a mere accident that the creature 
which is distinguished as progressive should also be distinguished as coming slowly 
to maturity, or is there a reason lying deep down in the nature of things why this 
should be so? 
He then points out the great advantage that has come to the race 
through what he calls the period of mental plasticity; that is, the period 
of infancy, youth, and adolescence, forming nearly one-third of a human 
life, during which the individual is trained for his social duties. 
The social condition of man has now reached a high degree of com- 
plexity. This social condition can be protected and properly developed 
only so far as education provides for training the youth of a community 
for the duties and responsibilities incident thereto. With just as much 
thoroughness, with just as much care, we need, at the present time, 
to train our children to all that makes for high and noble living. As 
the Greeks trained for the conditions existing in the Greek state, as the 
Romans trained for the conditions existing in the Roman state, so also 
we must recognize the supreme importance of training in all that makes 
for the highest intellectual culture and refinement in human life. With 
the absence of the militant power in our American state we base our 
institutions entirely upon the dominance of the moral and spiritual 
faculties among men. Indeed, our social and political organization rests 
wholly upon the belief that the majority of men prefer good to evil, 
virtue to vice, and if we take a broad view of the active forces in the 
social organism, we see on every hand virtue grappling with vice, justice 
struggling with injustice; and in these struggles we see that success 
can be hoped for only as all the higher faculties of man are brought 
into play upon the side of justice and of virtue. To state the problem 
in a few words, our duty is to so organize the forces that make for 
right living that they shall always be the dominant power in the social 
organism; and it is only when we come to recognize this condition as 
fundamental to all growth in human well-being that we can get a proper 
comprehension of what is involved in public education at the present 
time. 
When the education of the people is looked at from this point of 
view it is seen that its greatest power must be exerted where the
-P-A-G-E-853

dangers to the social organism are greatest—that is, among the poorest 
classes. There is more need of the refining influences of the best edu- 
cation among the debased and neglected elements of population in our 
large cities than among the children of the rich and prosperous; and 
hence the movement of the last few years to carry the most improved 
forms of our education among the lowest classes is an indication of the 
growth of public sentiment in the right direction, and is a feeling that 
will undoubtedly grow in strength as social problems are more carefully 
studied. : 
We have seen in many parts of the country the growth of a very 
praiseworthy sentiment in favor of raising the national flag over our 
schoolhouses. The spirit that prompted this movement was a patriotic 
one, and marks the growth of a national feeling stronger than that of 
local interests. To the educator it should stand for more than a mere 
loyalimpulse. The flag should be made to represent more than the 
sovereign power and unity of the union. Consider for a moment that 
in our large cities the great mass of the children see little or nothing 
of the government or the forces that bind society together except as 
presented by the policeman. What better instrumentality is there for 
inculeating in the minds of the young a respect for government and 
law than the schoolhouse? If we can lead the pupils to understand 
that the schoolhouse is provided by the State, is provided for all with- . 
out distinction of race, condition, or creed; if we can make the school- 
house a place of delight, and if we can secure within it the right sort 
of instruction, the training that shall tend to develop the noblest qual- 
ities of mind and heart, we shall then be fostering not simply a love of 
country for its past history and the heroic deeds of our ancestors, but 
we shall be cultivating a love of country for what the country is doing 
for the children themselves in preparing them for the highest and best 
purposes in life. Then will the flag mean something personal to every 
ehild. Then will the Government be to him not simply an abstraction, 
but he will come to regard it as his own great helper and sustainer. 
I welcome, therefore, this nationalization of the school as one of the 
most important of the educational movements of our time. 
If, however, we make the school the symbol of the State to children, 
we must have taught in it all that the child requires to enable him to 
become a virtuous and a useful citizen. Ido not think there can be 
any gainsaying this proposition. Indeed, it follows logically from the 
very establishment of a public school; and in our day, when such 
important responsibilities are attached to citizenship, the public school 
and its instrumentalities must be measured solely by its capacity to 
realize its complete function. : 
Nearly all the States have limited the instruction that shall be given 
in publie schools, and some confine it within very narrow bounds. But 
we are gradually outgrowing the restricted ideas of education of fifty 
years ago, and our more intelligent communities are already anticipating 
 
-P-A-G-E-854
  796 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95, 
legislative action and are putting into their schools new subjects for 
study, new exercises which have for their object the development of 
the higher powers of the pupils and bringing them into the closest 
possible relations to the social needs of the future. Look for a moment 
at some of the movements that are going forward at the present time 
for enlarging the scope of public education. Tirst we have the kinder- 
garten, the recognition of the child in education, one of the most 
beneficent reforms that have ever come into the schools. Then we have 
physical training, the recognition of the fact that the citizen to have a 
healthy mind must also have a healthy body. Then we have the study 
of elementary science, which has for its object the bringing of the 
individual into the closest relations with his physical environment, 
that he may be able to enrich the world by his conquests over nature; 
that he may, to use the words of Bacon, become the “minister and 
interpreter of nature.” Then we have industrial or manual training, 
which recognizes that labor is one of the conditions of man’s existence 
in the world, and that it is through understanding labor and putting 
thought into labor that man is brought more completely into sympathy 
with his fellows. Then we have the study of history, not simply as 
the record of man’s military conquests, but rather as showing the 
steady development of the idea of brotherhood among men. And then, 
in addition to these, we have the instruction in art, in some respects 
the most important of all, because its influence tends to enrich the 
mind as a whole through the development and training of its highest 
faculties. 
Now, cavil as we may against these new studies; argue, as many 
persons do, upon the limitations which are, or ought to be, imposed 
upon the State, all these features must come into the public schools, 
and in no niggardly way. They must come in on the broadest possible 
basis, or there is danger that the present tendencies of social progress 
will miscarry. That their introduction into the schools will revolution- 
ize much of our existing education can not be denied; but that need 
not give cause for serious regret. We may lay it down as a funda- 
mental and incontestable proposition that existing social conditions 
demand these two things: First, the highest order of citizenship possi- 
ble; and second, that public education must prepare for such citizen- 
ship at whatever cost. 
I have prefaced these remarks because in discussing “Art education 
in the public schools” it has seemed desirable for the right under- 
standing of the subject that it should be considered, not simply as a 
specialty in education, but rather in the larger aspect of one of the 
branches of general education that has become a necessity of our time. 
It is only by regarding the subject in its broadest relations that we can 
rightly consider how it should be treated in the schools. It will be 
understood that, in so far as the elementary schools are concerned, I am 
using the term “art education” as limited to drawing and color, 
 
-P-A-G-E-855
  ART EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 797 
Of the new studies referred to, art education is the one least under- 
stood, and yet it is the one that in many respects is the most important. 
Next to language there is no branch whose scope and purpose is so far 
reaching or that bears more directly upon all that ministers to the best 
interests of the individual and of society. I am aware that many will 
regard this as far too inclusive a statement, and yet the history of civil- 
ization shows that the arts which deal with form and color have been 
at once of the highest value to man’s utilitarian necessities and to those 
desires which nothing but the beautiful in nature and in art can satisfy. 
As a people, I think it will be admitted that we are deficient in art 
culture, and I do not think it will be denied that in consequence we 
are losing no small part of our intellectual heritage. This will not 
always beso. The indications are many that art is to have a new devel- 
opment in America, and on a new basis—the basis of humanity. The 
putting of industrial training into the schools is a great step in this 
direction, and will surely give a higher idea and a nobler purpose to 
the labor of common life. The putting of art education into the schools, 
side by side with industrial training, will not only give dignity to labor 
but will also permit the human feeling born of labor to find fit and 
adequate expression. 
The use of the term “art education” in connection with the public 
education has long been a great bugbear to many so-called practical 
people. ‘to such persons the word art in connection with the public 
schools savors of something unpractical, something that is for special 
pupils, something for the benefit of the few rather than for the many; 
aud yet aright understanding of the relations of art to daily life shows 
this to be an entire misconception of the subject. It is a fact apparent 
to every observing person that the social life of our people is lamentably 
wanting in an appreciation of the beautiful in nature as the highest 
truth of nature, and of the beautiful in human life and work as the 
highest truth of character. This is apparent in the homes, in the 
amusements, and in the social customs of our people generally. In 
the scramble for wealth that is going on, people are losing sight of the 
fundamental ethical principles that hold society together, and are mak- 
ing a pretense of living. Now, art education, which is the study of 
beauty as the highest truth in nature and in human life, can be directed 
powerfully against this social demoralization, and hence we should be 
prepared to advocate art education in the schools as a potent agency 
in the uplifting and improvement of the community. 
Goethe says: 
The beautiful is greater than the good, for it includes the good and adds some- 
thing toit. It is the good made perfect and fitted with all the collateral perfections 
which make it a perfect thing. 
This is but a restatement of the old Platonic doctrine which still 
finds recognition in the most advanced theories of ethics and education. 
While we are extending our system of education on the utilitarian side,
-P-A-G-E-856
  198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
‘we must not forget that the right enjoyment of life—that is, the exer- 
cise of the higher faculties—is as much a function of living as earning 
one’s daily bread; and for our education to be useful, in the true sense 
of the term, we can not ignore the training of ‘the esthetic faculties as 
much for moral as for practical ends. 
T have felt constrained to emphasize this aspect of the subject as of 
supreme importance at the present time, because in the general intro- 
duction of form study and drawing into the schools there seems to 
prevail an idea that their chief value consists in subserving industrial 
ends, or as aids to other branches of instruction. The great value of 
form study and drawing in industry, as well as their great use in edu- 
cational training, can hardly be overestimated; but form study and 
drawing as the basis of art education need to be considered in much 
broader relations than their application in these directions. 
Now, art in form and color is not an abstraction. It is something 
very tangible. It is man’s creative work with material things; work 
in which he expresses himself, his power, his knowledge, his feelings, 
his ideas, for the use and the enjoyment of others. With every child 
there is born some degree of this power of individual creation, and 
closely allied to it is another and complementary power, that of curi- 
osity or observation; and it should be a principle in all general educa- 
tion to lay hold of these two great instinctive powers and give them 
free play in the training of every child. True art education distinctly 
recognizes these two mental powers as its starting point, and seeks to 
stimulate and direct them so that they shall act and react on each 
other, and result in the creation of beautiful things, not so much for 
the gratification of selfish or individual desires as for giving joy to 
others. The method of training for this end has a dual aspect. On 
the one side the child is led, through the exercise of his observing 
powers, to discover that beauty is the highest truth in all material 
things, in fact, that there can be no beauty devoid of truth; and, on 
the other side, he is trained to express his observation of the beautifal 
in creations that shall minister to the needs and pleasure of man. It 
has been truly said that sharing in some common enjoyment begets 
a more friendly feeling toward others than sharing in the same kind of 
knowledge. 
Not until art education is viewed in these broader aspects can the 
subject take its rightful place in public education. For not until the 
psychological conditions for the training of the child are comprehended 
can a method of instruction in art suitable to children be devised, and 
not until its applications in social life are comprehended can the object 
of art in education be understood. : 
It is not necessary to dwell upon the fact that this view of art educa- 
tion does not present the subject as in any way antagonistic to its 
applications to industry, or to other branches of education. In fact, the 
more the subject is studied from this larger point of view the more will
-P-A-G-E-857
  ART EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 799 
it be seen that its practical applications, both in industrial training and 
in general educational training, are greatly increased, because there is 
brought to its application in these directions the creative power of the 
pupils, enriched by the study of the beautiful, which is the life-giving 
principle in all industrial work, and the most subtle and refining force 
in all intellectual development and training. 
With these points in mind, and in view of the wide introduction of 
drawing into the schools, a pertinent question arises here. Is the study 
coming into public education on the basis of art, or is it coming in on 
the basis of utility? If we look at the history of the movement for 
introducing drawing into the schools, which began about twenty years 
ago, we shall see that it started upon a purely utilitarian or industrial 
basis. The movement, in its inception, was but a reflection—in many 
respects a copy—of the movement which was initiated about a score of 
years earlier in England, and which has been promoted there almost 
solely for the benefit of the manufacturing interests of Great Britain. 
As the movement has developed in this country, however, it is to be 
observed that it has been steadily widening in character under the 
influences of educational thought and discussion. Experience has long 
made it apparent that drawing could not be maintained in the schools 
as a general study simply on the basis of its technical applications 
in industry. Consequently, the last ten years have shown important 
modifications of the instruction in the direction of bringing it into 
harmony with psychological principles. It was an important step in 
this direction when form study, or the study of objects, was made the 
starting pointin the instruction. Then drawing took its place as one of 
the means of expressing ideas of form, and in many of our principal 
cities the method of instruction has been radically changed so as to 
make the study of form in models and objects the fandamental feature 
of the work. Under this arrangement the various kinds of drawing, 
such as free-hand drawing, mechanical drawing, perspective drawing, 
decorative drawing, are of secondary consideration, and are governed 
entirely by what the children have studied and by the ideas they have 
to express resulting therefrom. 
That this change is in the right direction will not be questioned by 
anyone acquainted with the subject; but it will be a serious mistake 
to say that, because the method of teaching drawing has been changed 
so as to make it the expression of ideas derived from the study of 
objects, the problem of art education in the schools has been solved. 
In fact, it may be said that with this change of method the real prob- 
lem confronts us from a new and broader aspect than when we were 
dealing with the subject simply from the standpoint of drawing. Hav- 
ing reached the stage where drawing is regarded as but a means for 
the expression of form ideas derived from the study of objects, the 
vital point in the instruction now turns upon this question: What 
kind of objects shall we give the children to study for the development
-P-A-G-E-858
800 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of the ideas to be expressed? It is not infrequently claimed that 
the interest of the child should be the guiding consideration here. 
That we should have regard for what shall attract and hold the atten- 
tion of the pupil is not to be questioned; but it would be a great mis- 
take to assume that this should be the only consideration. 
If the love of the beautiful and the creation of the beautiful is the 
aim of the instruction, then it would seem that the objects given the 
pupils to study should be such as clearly present the characteristics 
of beauty. Now, some of the objects that most interest a child may 
be such as possess no distinctive features of beauty—may be such as 
appeal to his selfish instincts or feelings. I am sure we shall all agree 
that such objects should not be chosen. But it is said that leaves, 
plants, flowers, fruit interest children, and as beauty is found in the 
study of nature, natural forms should be given as the basis of the in- 
struction. No one will dispute that in this art training children 
should be given every possible opportunity to study nature, but in the 
choice of natural forms great care should be exercised in selecting 
only such as present, distinctly, beauty of form. It should also be 
borne in mind that the study of nature for the purposes of art is a 
widely different thing from the study of nature for the purposes of 
science. In the scientific study of nature she is interrogated for her 
facts, and these facts may be found—indeed, often are found—in objects 
devoid of beauty. The facts, however, are none the less interesting 
from the scientific point of view. The scientific study of nature, there- 
fore, is purely objective, and takes little or no account of the wsthetic 
elements which are involved in the observation of things from the 
standpoint of art. : 
_In the artistic study of nature, however, the beautiful is the end 
sought; and the appreciation of the highest beauty in nature is real- 
ized only when it is perceived that the various objects in nature are 
fashioned upon certain type forms which express unity and purpose as 
the highest truths in nature, truths that transcend all material mani- 
festations and witness the supreme, eternal power that lies back of, and 
gives life to, nature. The natural objects are very few that express 
this truth, this beauty of nature, in all their details. They become 
beautiful only as they are seen in their typical relations. It is one of 
the functions of art to present the objects of nature, not in their acci- 
dental, but in their typical relations; in other words, to interpret nature 
in her highest aspects, not simply to imitate her in her details. Hence 
the art study of nature becomes largely subjective, and is very differ- 
ent from the objective study for the purposes of science. 
If this principle be conceded, the question arises, what are the typi- 
eal forms that the study of nature for art purposes reveals as the 
supreme content of nature? They are very few, and they are very 
simple forms—namely, the sphere, the cube, the cylinder, the ellipsoid, 
the ovoid, the prism, the cone, and the pyramid. The wonderful
-P-A-G-E-859
ART EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 801 
variety of forms which are observed in nature are but modifications of, 
or are derived from, these typical forms. These types, therefore, should 
be regarded as truths of form in nature just as distinctly as gravity is 
regarded as a truth of power in nature. 
Now, if it be one of the functions of art to interpret beauty of form 
in nature, this beauty will be perceived in its highest aspects only as 
it is seen to be related to the highest truths of form in nature. Hence 
we are brought to the conclusion that as the typical forms referred te 
are the abstract embodiment of the highest truths of form in nature, 
they should be used in our elementary instruction as the best means of 
leading the children to discover and to realize the highest forms of 
beauty in the world of nature. 
3ut the study of beauty in nature is only one phase of art education. 
The study of the beautiful in the creative works of man is quite as 
important a feature. The study of beauty of form in man’s art work 
reveals the fact that it also is based upon the same typical forms that 
are found to be the embodiment of the highest beauty of form in nature, 
and it is the manner in which man has utilized these types with his 
creative imagination in the production of works for use and enjoyment 
that gives to his art works their highest character and significance. 
Thus we are brought to the final conclusion that for art training, which 
is to include the study of the beautiful in nature and the beautiful in 
art, we must adopt the type forms of the sphere, the cube, the cylinder, 
the ellipsoid, the ovoid, the prism, the cone, the pyramid, as the abstract 
representatives of all beauty, whether in nature or in art, growing out 
of the truths of form. The eternal power that speaks through nature’s 
works invests these forms with life and gives to them their highest 
beauty. In art, man’s imagination invests these forms with humanity, 
which is the very culmination of beauty in art. Beauty in nature and 
beauty in art are, therefore, in their ultimate analysis one, and rest 
upon the same unchanging truths of form. 
If I rightly apprehend the instruction in form study and drawing 
that is now finding its way into the schools, it is based upon the dis- 
tinct recognition of these type forms as the fundamental verities for 
the training of children to perceive beauty of form in nature and in 
art; and it is the aim of the instruction so to connect the study of these 
typical forms, with carefully selected natural forms and fine examples 
of art forms, that the children may be brought through the legitimate 
and happy exercise of their observing and creative powers under the 
influence of the beautiful as the highest truth of nature and of art. 
This is not the occasion for the presentation of the details involved in 
carrying out this important work. This task may be left to the many 
able directors of drawing, who, in several of our leading cities, are en- 
deavoring to give to form study and drawing the broad character here 
indicated, and who are laboring against great obstacles arising from 
the general misconception of the subject which exists in the public mind 
ED 95. 26  
-P-A-G-E-860
  802 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
and in the minds of some who are directing the schools. It seems the 
proper place, however, for the consideration of a few points whereby 
the instruction in the schools may be made more efficient. 
To this end one fact must be distinctly recognized as fundamental to 
any substantial and permanent success—that the instruction in the 
grades below the high school must be given by the regular class 
teachers. This is so obvious a fact in efficient school management as 
to need no argument. Following from this, however, are three very 
important points which I will venture to state: 
First. A course of study should be prepared in which the orderly 
development of the subject through all the grades should be clearly 
presented. But few of the regular teachers have had any training in 
art worthy of the name. They need, therefore, to have it so presented 
that they may be able not only to become acquainted with the features 
to be taught in their respective grades, but also to see the unfolding 
of the subject through all the grades. Not until the class teachers are 
able to take this comprehensive view of the work, not until they sce 
that the study must be recognized as an organic feature in the general 
course, can they be expected to take an interest in it. 
Second. The instruction in this subject in the schools should be 
under the direction of special directors of art education. These direct- 
ors should be broadly educated persons. It is not enough that they 
have received training in technical art work. They should also be 
familiar with educational methods; with the general school conditions 
that surround the teaching of art in the public schools; and, above all, 
they should be able to interpret the work in its principles and methods 
to the class teachers, as well as to criticise and supervise it. 
Third. The schools need to be supplied with more and better objects 
for the children to study. The models of the type forms that are now 
being so generally introduced should be supplemented with casts of 
natural forms, artistically treated, so that the pupils in their individual 
study of natural forms may see proper specimens of the art rendering 
of nature, and also with reproductions of historical ornament, both in 
relief and in color, in order to afford opportunity for studying good 
examples of art work applied to the things of common life. In addi- 
tion to these there should also be provided reproductions of choice vase 
forms from classic, renaissance, and oriental art. Man’s realization of 
pure beauty of form and color has found one of its most pleasing modes 
of expression in fictile art, and as these vase forms can be shown to be 
developments under the influence of the feeling for beauty from the 
type forms we have been considering, and as they are full of historic 
associations, they will greatly interest the pupils, and can, therefore, 
be studied with much greater profit for purposes of object drawing than 
‘the miscellaneous objects, possessing no well-defined elements of beauty, 
that are too frequently placed before them. 
With well-considered courses of instruction in art education, with
-P-A-G-E-861
ART EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 803 
the schools supplied with suitable materials and objects of study, with 
proper directors in charge of the work, we should see, I believe, a real 
art development in this country unexampled in the world’s history. 
Reference has already been made to the want of art culture among 
our people. This is one of the noticeable facts connected with our 
social life, and yet the student of history sees that man’s creations in 
art are among his highest achievements, and that they are identified 
with his highest moral and spiritual development. In the perspective 
of history it is the art creations of Athens and Rome and Florence and 
Venice, enshrining as they do some of the loftiest conceptions of the 
human mind, that make these cities immortal in the memory of man. 
As a people we are ignorant of the uplifting and ennobling influence 
of art; and yet we have in our public school system the grandest 
opportunity that was ever given to carry a love for the beautiful into 
every home, to make it the possession of every man and woman in the 
land. But we may look into the future with hope. With the growth 
of our national power and the development of our material resources, 
we are broadening our education, and thereby opening the way for a 
better, a nobler, a happier existence for the people. We are putting 
into the schools those studies and methods that will powerfully help in 
transforming the conditions upon which the progress, the order, and 
the stability of the State depend. The kindergarten recognizes the 
humanity of the child. The study of science recognizes the world of 
nature as a Divine storehouse, filled with exhaustless treasures for 
ministering to the wants of man. The industrial training recognizes 
labor as fundamental alike to the freedom and independence of the 
individual, and the power and prosperity of the nation. Art educa- 
tion recognizes the beautiful as not only the supreme truth in the 
material world, but as a part of the supreme truth in the moral world, 
and that so far as it enters into the human life it is a Divine influence 
that purifies the hearts and souls of men. 
The love of the beautiful, therefore, should be one of the finest 
results of our public education, and when art instruction shall be so 
incorporated into the schools that its rich, benign influence shall per- 
meate the life of the whole people, we may then write over the door of 
every American schoolhouse these inspiring words of Schiller: 
Create the beautiful, and seeds are sown 
For God-like flowers to man as yet unknown.

FACILITIES FOR THE UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF 
WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 
From notes, by MarTua Foorr Crow, Ph. D., Assistant Professor of English 
Literature in the University of Chicago. 
WOMEN AT THE UNIVERSITY AT OXFORD. 
I. INTRODUCTION. 
It is not the intention to give here a full account of the university 
system. Many books have been written on this subject, treating of its 
historical and present features, and showing how the existing very 
complicated mass of regulations and arrangements has been gradually 
formed in the devious windings of the centuries. -Even if an attempt 
should be made to display the intricacies of the system, a dismal failure 
would probably be the result—a failure to which less discredit would 
be attached if it were revealed that it is said at Oxford that no one 
dares pretend to understand the Oxford University system. To one 
coming from a land where in the fresh light of to-day everything is 
being made at first hand and where what is thought to be the very 
Jatest has a greater value than any old thing can possibly have, it 
seems strange to find the meaning of an odd custom or an unusual dif- 
ferentiation of subject in the schemes of study or a peculiar title for 
a department of work accounted for on the ground that it is thought to 
have its origin in monastic customs in the early days, or, it was so dif. 
ferentiated five hundred years ago, or, the schoolmen thought they got 
this queerness from Aristotle, and we do not like to change the word. 
With the distinct understanding that no attempt will be here made to 
give a full view of these bewildering details that have grown up through 
centuries of historie tradition, and have been modified in a hundred 
minute ways by the varying circumstances and needs of the different 
eras through which the institution has lived, and that it shall be con- 
sidered a quite sufficient answer to any curious question to say, it is so 
because it always has been so, an answer that always pacities the elo- 
quence of flippant objectors to the existing state of things in classic 
English circles, a brief account of the main features only will be given;

women coming from the United States for purposes of study shall if 
possible be explained with sufficient fullness to prevent misunder- 
standing. 
It is only a few years since women began to study at Oxford, and 
the movement was to some extent preceded by the establishment of 
“local examinations,” held at different centers throughout the country. 
These were started first for boys, then girls were admitted to them; 
then a higher examination for women over 18 years of age was started. 
These examinations are conducted by a special board known as the 
delegacy for local examinations, and so the work at Oxford has devel- 
oped and the regular university examinations have been opened to 
women. Everything connected with this part of the work, i. e., the 
examination of Oxford female students, whether by the degree exami- 
nations of the university or by the special examinations for women, 
has been in the hands of this delegacy. The opening out of the uni- 
versity examinations has always taken place in the form of permissions 
to the delegacy to use the university examinations in their examina- 
tions of women. Of course this is a mere form of words, but it means 
that the business of everything that concerns women’s examinations is 
managed by this delegacy. 
The other body that is concerned with the women students is the 
Oxford Association for the Education of Women (p. 808). This associa- 
tion arranges for the teaching of the women students, and by appoint- 
ing on its council representatives from the women’s colleges really 
confers a sort of informal license on these colleges. 
Residence is provided for the students in three special halls, i. e., 
Somerville Colloge, Lady Margaret Hall, and St. Hugh’s Hall, and 
one under separate supervision. 
II. UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE. 
The word “university,” as used in England, may have any one of sey- 
eral meanings. It may mean the whole body of instructors and students 
with all the institutions, by means of which they carry on the collective 
system of their work. But it may also mean the “body corporate” 
that, by its functions and its delegated committees, exercises jurisdic- 
tion over the whole, appoints professors and readers, gives degrees and 
sends up two members to the House of Commons. 
The university has 11,000 members, 8,000 graduates and 3,000 under- 
graduates, the latter being, of course, in residence in the different 
colleges, as well as a small number of the former. 
Not all graduates are members; only such as retain this position by 
the payment of certain yearly dues. And this is an important matter, 
as will be seen. The government of the university is vested in three 
bodies, the convocation, which consists of all members of the university 
who have taken the degree of master of arts or of doctor of medicine, 
civil law, or divinity, resident or nonresident; the congregation and
-P-A-G-E-865
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 807 
the hebdomadal council. All legislation is initiated by the latter, 
adopted, rejected, or amended in the congregation, rejected or adopted 
(but not amended) in the convocation. The convocation also confers 
honorary degrees and also degrees granted by decree or diploma, and 
transacts much other important business. 
This plan attaches the graduates, wherever they may be scattered 
throughout the Kingdom and the world, very closely to the university. 
They have a vote and an influence and a share in its government. 
A college is a corporate body quite distinct from but forming a part 
of the university itself, using the word in a restricted sense. The sep- 
arate colleges are more or less subject to the laws and regulations made 
by the university, and they are intimately associated with the univer- 
sity. The great majority of the members of the university belong to 
the colleges, and all who belong to the various colleges at the same time 
are members of the university. There are two ways by which a man 
becomes a student-member of the university. He approaches this posi- 
tion through one of the colleges, whose duty it is to ascertain his fitness 
for admission to the university, or he may become a noncollegiate or 
unattached student, not belonging to any college or hall, and in this 
case placed under the care of the delegacy for noncollegiate students. 
To the separate colleges also, in the main, belong the scholarships and 
exhibitions which are offered to those who begin a university course. 
These scholarships are very numerous and of great value. Many of 
them have been handed down from centuries ago. The pages that 
describe them and the conditions of admission to them in books of 
information for undergraduates take up a large part of the space. It 
is one of the most interesting features of the English university sys- 
tem, a feature that in the opinion of many ought to be copied in the 
young institutions of the New World. This element softens to some 
extent the feeling one must have when one realizes the enormous 
expense of the life of the student under present university conditions. 
Every college has its own regulations for the admission of candi- 
dates, but there is a certain set of regulations common to all. The 
university makes the passing of certain examinations one of the con- 
ditions of the attainment of the B. A. degree, but the colleges may 
arrange for special ways of preparing for these examinations. ‘The 
university imposes certain limits of time within which these examina- 
tions must be passed, but the separate colleges may make special laws 
also if they choose in regard to the time that shall be spent and the 
methods that shall be employed in preparing for the examinations. 
Some colleges will not accept as a candidate for admission anyone who 
does not intend to read for honors. It is not impyssible also for per- 
sons who do not intend to proceed to the bachelor of arts degree to 
enter the university with a view to some special study. In such a 
case as this the entrance examination may be excused, provided suffi- 
cient evidence is given of the ability to prosecute those studies with 
advantage.
-P-A-G-E-866
  808 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
There are 21 colleges and each one is housed in a noble set of build- 
ings, arranged about a quadrangle or charming lawn and garden 
placed in the center. There is always a beautiful chapel, filled with 
associations of the olden time, and the hall in which the students dine 
is usually of lofty proportions, and upon its walls are hung portraits of 
the founders and benefactors of the college. The hall is also used as 
a lecture room, and the long oak dining tables are converted for the 
time being into writing desks where the undergraduates sit and take 
notes of the lecture as it is pronounced from the lecture stand placed 
for the time being on the “high.” The “high” is a raised platform 
at the upper end of the hall, upon which a table is placed for the use 
of the fellows at dinner. In every college there are a certain num- 
ber of fellowships which are permanent, and which are occupied by- 
men who either employ themselves in research study or instruct as 
tutors or lecturers; and in order that the institution shall be a college 
rather than simply a hall there must be attached to it a number of 
such instructors and lecturers, who act as advisers to undergraduates 
in regard to the lectures that they shall hear and the books that they 
shall read and who take charge of their written work, to which a great 
deal of importance is attached. There are other differences, but this 
seems to be the main distinction between a college and a hall; that a 
hall is a home for a certain number of students, but does not neces- 
sarily include a body of fellows and instructors. 
The Women’s Colleges at Oxford have no real splendor of building 
or tradition. They are but new institutions and come rather under the 
heading of halls, for they are mainly meant as places of residence. 
Properly, however, Somerville is a college, and Lady Margaret’s and 
St. Hugh’s are halls. These will be described in their proper place 
later on. 
III, THe ASSOCIATION FOR THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN. 
The general arrangement of all matters in connection with the educa- 
tion of women in Oxford has been from the first under the care of one 
general association, now known as the Association for the Education 
of Women in Oxford. The first scheme for lectures and classes for 
women in Oxford was organized as early as 1865. These lectures were 
continued for some years. In 1873 another scheme of the kind was set 
on foot by a committee of ladies, Mrs. Max Miiller being the treasurer, 
Mrs. Humphrey Ward and Mrs. Creighton, followed by Mrs. T. H. Green, 
the secretaries. Lectures were given by Professor Stubbs, now Bishop 
of Oxford, by Mrs. Faweett, and by several Oxford tutors and lecturers, 
and classes were held for languages and mathematics. 
The association, as it now exists, was founded in June, 1878. A 
committee was formed and the necessary funds were subscribed. The 
association was thus enabled to offer at once two scholarships. 
In 1880 one college lecture was attended; at the present time students
-P-A-G-E-867
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 809 
are admitted, under certain regulations, to lectures in almost every 
college in Oxford. 
In 1893 the work of the committee was readjusted, the name Council 
adopted, and a standing committee appointed termed the “ Educational 
committee,” consisting of the honorable secretary and treasurer of the 
association, and not less than three of its tutors or teachers, and the 
principals of the halls. In the same year the university for the first 
time gave official recognition to the association by the appointment of 
the dean of Christ Church to sit on its council as the representative 
of the hebdomadal council. The vice-chancellor also lent a room in the 
Clerenden Building for use as an office. 
In the year 1884 the first university examinations were opened to 
women. These were honor moderations and the final schools of math- 
ematics, science, and modern history. In 1886 responsions were opened, 
in 1890 the honor school of jurisprudence and the final examination for 
B. music, in 1893 the honor schools of theology and of oriental studies 
and the examination for D. music, and in 1894 the remaining examina- 
tions for the degree of B. A. 
Thanks to the exertions of the association, every university exami- 
nation for the degree of B. A. (pass or honor) is open to women, and 
almost every college admits them to lectures. It only remains for the 
university to grant the degree. 
The number of association students that have attended lectures in 
Oxford is several hundred. A large number of these have obtained 
honors in the examinations, 51 having obtained a first class and 86 a 
record. 
The association does not undertake to house students, halls being 
founded for the purpose. At present these are three in number, Somer- 
ville College, Lady Margaret Hall, and St. Hugh’s Hall. The associa- 
tion has formulated conditions under which it will acknowledge new 
halls. 
The association consists of ordinary members, honorary members, and 
student members. 
All women who desire to attend lectures provided by the association, 
with a view to a definite course of study, must enter their names on 
the association register. Registered students pay 5s. per annum. 
After three such annual payments, all students who have obtained a 
complete certificate in the second public examination (pass or honors) 
of the university, or in the second examination for women (honors) of 
the delegates of local examinations, will be permanently registered as 
student members of the association with the right to vote at meetings. 
Registered students must reside in one of the halls represented on 
the council, or with their parents or guardians, or in other places 
approved by the council. Students who are not in a hall are called 
home students and are under the care of a special subcommittee and of

be received into private family at a charge of from £1 5s. to £2 12s. 6d. 
aweek. The cost of lodgings in Oxford is from 10s. a week upward; 
board may be reckoned at from 12s. a week. Students can also be 
received at St. Hilda’s, Cowley House, and St. Kentigern’s Hostel, The 
‘rescent. The principal of the home students is Mrs. Johnson, who 
was for many years honorary secretary of the association. Miss 
Thorold Rogers, one of the tutors of Somerville, has now taken her 
place as honorary secretary. 
The association procures permission to attend lectures which have 
not hitherto been open to women. As an extremely influential body, it 
is able to procure many advantages for its members which they could 
not otherwise obtain. It is hoped that eventually the association may 
be recognized as a sort of woman’s board of the university. At jres- 
ent the formal recognition it receives is very slight, viz: 
(1) The appointment of one member of the hebdomadal council or the 
council of the association, and one on the council of Somerville College. 
(2) The privilege of using a room in a university building as the 
office of the association. 
Informally, however, its influence is of great importance, since it 
includes among its honorary members some of the most influential 
members of the university, e. g., heads of houses and professors, and 
this is sufficient to insure its members the continuance of past favors, 
which before too long, it is hoped, will be transmuted into rights and 
privileges. 
It would be quite possible for a woman to reside in Oxford for the 
purpose of study quite independent of the association. She might 
attend the university lectures which are open to the public, and in case 
she obtained the private permission of professors or lecturers to attend 
their more public courses of lectures, she might do so; but it would be 
better in all cases to be connected with the association, in order that 
the interests of the women students may be understood, and that no 
mistakes and misunderstandings may occur. It must be noted that 
the lectures are opened to association students, not to women in gen- 
eral; and when every facility is given by the association arrangements, 
and when the association is evidently in the hands of those who under- 
stand the situation and are applying the best judgment and the wisest 
policy to the present phase of development, women would do their own 
cause injury by attempting to work outside. In fact, it is very doubtful 
whether any such attempt would succeed. 
Besides procuring its members admission to university and college 
lectures, the association provides certain courses itself, particularly in 
such subjects as modern languages, to which the university has only 
just begun to turn its attention. 
Each course of association lectures is followed by a terminal exami- 
nation, which students must attend unless specially exempted. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-869
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 811 
examination does not count toward the final test, but is simply designed 
to gauge the progress of students.. A student who was not employing 
her time profitably might be asked to withdraw. 
The very great usefulness of such an association as this is evident, 
especially in this early stage when the university has not as yet in any 
way formally acknowledged the existence of the Women’s College. It 
fuses into one the interests of all the women in the different halls and 
all others living in Oxford or elsewhere who are studying under the 
direction of Oxford instructors. It makes a point of comparison anda 
court of appeal. It brings the two bodies of instructors and instructed 
into proper touch without friction. It acts as a friendly go-between 
for the by no means won university and the women who are just out- 
side the sacred inclosure. It sees that instruction is provided in every 
department in which women desire it. It provides the terminal exami- 
nations and sees that no one escapes this check upon the casual students. 
In fine, its object is to oil the wheels everywhere, and see that no loop- 
hole is left for the entrance of any objection. 2 
All communications with regard to the association should be 
addressed to the honorable secretary, Miss Rogers, Association for the 
Education of Women, Clarendon Building, Broad street, Oxford. 
IV. EXAMINATIONS. 
It will be simplest here to state the examinations to be passed and 
the conditions to be observed by a man who wishes to take his degree 
at Oxford, and then to point out the slight points of difference in the 
regulations for women. All examinations that lead to a degree in arts 
(which at Oxford include law, theology, and science) are open to women. 
The medical examinations and schools, i. e., the examinations and 
schools of the medical department, are closed to them. We are there- 
fore concerned here only with the various courses that lead to the 
degree of B, A., for the M. A. degree is not given for examination, but 
for a certain standing at the university. 
The general regulation for the B. A. degree at Oxford is the following: 
Any scholar in the faculty of arts may supplicate for the degree of 
bachelor in that faculty so soon as he shall have kept statutable resi- 
dence and employed himself in the study of arts and in hearing 
lectures for twelve terms, and shall have passed three examinations, 
namely, responsions and the first and second public examinations, at 
the several times and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth: 
A responsion is the first of three examinations, and is really prelimi- 
nary and may be passed before coming up. It is held four times in the 
year, three times in term, i.e.,in March, June, and December, to enable 
intending students to pass before they enter on their university studies. 
A fee of £2 2s. is charged, with 10s. 6d. for an additional subject. 
The examination is held in the New Schools, in High street, and 
usually occupies three days.
-P-A-G-E-870

It was the opinion of Marcian that war should be avoided as long as it is possible 
to preserve a secure and honorable peace, but it was likewise his opinion that peace 
can not be honorable and secure if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion 
to war. This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of Attila, who 
insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute. The emperor signified to the 
barbarians that they must no longer insult the majesty of Rome by the mention of 
a tribute; that he was disposed to reward with becoming liberality the faithful 
friendship of his allies; butif they presumed to violate the public peace, they should 
feel that he possessed troops and arms and resolution to repel their attacks. The 
same language, even in the camp of the Huns, was used by his ambassador Apol- 
lonius, whose bold refusal to deliver the presents till he had been admitted to a 
personal interview, displayed a sense of dignity, and a contempt of danger, which 
Attila was not prepared to expect from the degenerate Romans.

Passages for translation were given in thevarious works of the Greek 
and Latin authors which might possibly be offered. From each work 
two or three passages were quoted, taken from different parts of the 
work. In each passage from two to four words were underscored with 
the direction that such words should be parsed and, in case of verbs, 
that the principal parts should be given. 
There is also a special examination in additional subjects, which under 
certain circumstances enables candidates for a degree to omit the first 
public examination. Every such candidate is at liberty to offer him- 
self for examination in an additional subject at responsions, either at 
the same examination at which he offers stated subjects or at another 
examination; 
I. Every such candidate must offer one of the following subjects: 
(1) A portion of a Greek or Latin historical or philosophical author. 
He may offer any one of the following: Herodotus, Books 5,6, Plato, 
Apology and Meno. Livy, Books 21 and 22. Tacitus, Histories 1-3. 
(2) A portion of a French, German, or Italian historical or philosoph- 
ical author. 
He may offer any one of the following: Boissier, Cicéron et ses amis 
(omitting the Essays on Atticus and Czlius), Montesquieu, Esprit des 
Lois, Books 1-10. Ranke, Savonarola und die florentinische Republik 
gegen Ende des fiinfzehnten Jahrhunderts (in Historisch-biograph- 
ische Studien). Schiller, Ueber naive und sentimentalische Dichtung. 
Machiavelli, 1 Principe. Dino Compagni, Cronaca Fiorentina (third 
edition, Turin, 1884, Tipografia e Libreria Salesiana). 
(3) A portion of Bacon’s Novum Organum. Book 1. 
(4) The Elements of Logic, Deductive and Inductive. 
As responsions is a preliminary examination, there are several sub- 
stitutes for it. 
All these substitutes are allowed for women also, and some others in 
addition. In particular there is a special first examination for women, 
the standard of which corresponds with that of responsions. 
These are the regulations: 
Every candidate must pass at the same examination in— 
1. Any two of the following languages: (a) Latin, (b) Greek, (c) French or Italian, 
(d) German, 
2, Arithmetic.
-P-A-G-E-873
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 815 
8. (a) Euclid, Books I and I, or (b) algebra to simple equations, including addi- 
tion, subtraction, multiplication, division, greatest common measure, least common 
multiple, fractions, extraction of squaro root, and simple equations containing one 
or two unknown quantities, and problems producing such equations. 
The books to be prepared are, in Latin—in 1894, either Cicero, Pro Murena, Pro 
Lege Manilia (De Imperio Cn. Pompeii), or Virgil, Aen. I, II. In 1895, either Sallust, 
Cat. et Jugurth., or Virgil, Aen. I, II. In 1896, either Cwsar, Bell. Gall. I-IV, or    
Horace, Odes, I, II, and in Greek—in 1894, either Euripides, Hecuba, and Médea, or” 
Xenophon, Anabasis I-IV. In 1895, either Euripides, Hecuba, and Medea, or Xeno- 
phon, Anabasis [V-VII. In 1896, either Euripides, Alcestis, and Medea, or Xenophon, 
Anabasis, IV-VII. 
No books are prescribed in the other languages. No candidate may offer more 
than two languages. 
Candidates are examined in such manner as to test especially their knowledge of 
the grammar of the languages selected. Candidates must also translate a piece of 
English into Latin, French, or Italian, and German, as the case may be. 
The following are accepted by the delpgsire as exempting from the first examina- 
tion for women or responsions: 
(a) The matriculation examination of the University of London; (b) the previous 
examination of the University of Cambridge; (c) the preliminary examination in 
arts of the Victoria University, if the candidate has passed in the same examination 
in two of the languages, Latin, Greek, French, German, and in mathematics; (d) the 
Cambridge higher local examinations, if the candidate has passed in Group C and in 
two of the five languages, Latin, Greek, French, German, Italian; (e) the Oxford 
senior local examinations, if the candidate has passed in the same examination in

The examination in Holy Seripture is held four times in the year, in 
March, June, October, and December; they pass examination twice— 
in June and December; honors in classics only once—in March; hon- 
ors in mathematics twice—in June and December. The fees are £1 1s, 
for each part. 
‘Women are admitted and examined on the same conditions as men 
except that—(a) There is a difference in the examinations that exempt 
them from responsions, (b) There is no rule about the length of resi- 
dence required before entering for the examination. 
THE SECOND PUBLIC EXAMINATION. 
This examination is generally known as the final schools or by its 
slang name, “Greats.” Here, too, candidates may seek a mere pass, or 
they may seek honors. The examinations for pass and honors are 
quite distinct. 
As arule before entering for the final schools, a candidate is expected 
to have passed responsions and moderations, but there are many 
exemptions from this rule. In particular, an additional subject taken
-P-A-G-E-877
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 819 
at responsions exempts candidates who take certain subjects on the 
final schools from moderations. 
The regulations are too numerous and complicated to quote, but itis 
worth noting that even in the case of men the university does not 
always insist on the preliminary examinations. The difference in the 
case of women is that there is even more elasticity in the arrangement. 
The regulations are the following: 
(1) For pass candidates.—No candidate shall be admitted to any part of this 
school who has not either (1) obtained honors in the first public examination; or (2) 
satisfied the moderators in the examination of candidates not seeking honors; or (3) 
satisfied the moderators in mathematics and passed in an additional subject at 
responsions; or (4) satisfied the examiners in the preliminary examination of the 
honor school of jurisprudence and passed in an additional subject at responsions; 
or (5) satisfied the examiners in the preliminary examination in the honor school of 
natural science in two subjects and passed in an additional subject at responsions; 
or (6) passed the higher local examination in two languages in section A and either 
section D 1, 2, or section E 1. 
(2) For honors candidates—No candidate shall be admitted to any honor school 
who has not passed either (1) responsions (stated subjects); or (2) the first examina- 
tion for women (p.3); or (3) an examination accepted by the delegates as exempt- 
ing therefrom (p.3); and no candidate shall be admitted to the honor school of 
natural science who has not fulfilled the conditions prescribed in Statt. Tit. VI., Sect. 
1. c. § 5, ¢. 7 (vide Examination statutes). - 
The following are the regulations for the pass school: 
1. The subjects of examination for candidates who do not seek honors shall be

-P-A-G-E-880
  822 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
In Grovp D.1 
Candidates will be required to offer together at the same examination the subject 
(a) and any two of the four other subjects (b), (c), (d), (e). 
(a) Ezra and Nehemiah, with Haggai and Malachi, and The General Epistle 
of St. James and the First Epistle of St. Peter, to be studied in the original

For the pass schools there is no limit of time. For honors no one may 
enter before the eleventh or after the seventeenth term, unless honors 
have been already obtained in some other school. As Oxford counts 
four terms to a year, this means that the final schools are usually taken 
at the end of the third or fourth year, more commonly in the fourth. 
A candidate who fails in the pass schools may try again; @ candidate 
for honors may not. 
The rules as to number of terms do not of course apply to women, 
as the university takes no notice of their residence and the delegacy 
merely inquires as to the preliminary examinations which have been 
passed. 
THE HONORS SCHOOLS. 
There are eight distinct examinations, among which the candidate 
may choose one. These are: (1) Litera humaniores, (2) mathematics, 
(3) natural science, (4) jurisprudence, (5) modern history, (6) theology, 
(7) oriental studies, (8) English language and literature. 
As there is as yet no school for modern languages, the delegates 
provide a special one for women and they have also provided one 
hitherto in English, which will probably be discontinued. 
I. LITERA HUMANIORES. 
This is the school through which a great majority of Oxford men 
pass to the B. A. degree. The following is quoted from the preface of 
an account of it which appears in the Student’s Handbook: 
The school of liter humaniores, as it is the oldest, so it is admitted on all hands 
to be the premier school in dignity and importance. It counts the largest number of 
candidates, it includes the greatest proportion of the ablest students, it covers the 
1These regulations came into force in Michaelmas term, 1894. 
2A question having arisen as to the nature of the examination in the portion of 
the Old Testament prescribed for study in Hebrew, in Group D (6), the Board of the 
Faculty of Theology are of opinion that it is set as a subject of linguistic study, - 
and that only such knowledge of the subject-matter will be expected as is necessary 
for the interpretation of the text. 
 
-P-A-G-E-881
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 823 
widest area of study, it makes probably the severest demands both upon examiner 
and candidate; it carries the most coveted distinction. The course of combined 
studies for this school is peculiar to Oxford. Itis believed to confer a fine mental 
discipline and to favor a catholic and genuine culture. No one has claimed for it the 
manufacture of specialists; but most Oxford men, naturally proud of its tradition, 
have believed that there are few special studies for which it does not provide a 
sound preliminary training. 
The examination includes the Greek and Latin languages, the histo- 
ries of ancient Greece and Rome, logic and the outlines of moral and 
political philosophy. 
The examination consists of two parts, stated subjects and special 
subjects. Papers or questions will always be given in stated subjects; 
special subjects are offered by the candidates themselves. The stated 
subjects consist of the following: 
Greek and Latin languages.—All candidates will be expected to trans- 
late the Greek and Latin books offered by them for examination, and 
to translate passages from other books not specially offered. 
Passages will also be set for translation into Greek and Latin prose. 
The histories of ancient Greece and Rome.—All candidates are required 
to offer a period of Greek and a period of Roman history. The periods 
which may be offered are for the present— 
In Greek history (1) to the end of the Peloponnesian war, (2) from 
B. C. 500 to the death of Philip. With the first of these periods candi- 
dates are recommended to offer Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon’s 
Hellenics I, II. With the second, Herodotus V-LX, Thucydides, Xeno- 
phon’s Hellenics, Demosthenes, Olynthiacs, Philippics, De Falsa Lega- 
tione, and De Corona. 
In Roman history (1) from the beginning of the First Punic War to 
the Battle of Actium, (2) from the end of the Third Punic War to the 
aecession of Vespasian. With the first of these periods candidates are 
recommended to offer Polybius (Strachan Davidson’s Selections), Pla- 
tarch’s Lives of the Gracchi, Cicero’s Letters (Watson’s Selection), 
Sallust, Cataline and Jugurtha, Tacitus, Annals I-VI. Candidates 
will be expected to show such a knowledge of classical geography and 
antiquities, and of the general history of Greece and Rome, as shall be 
necessary for the profitable study of the authors or periods which they 
offer. 
Questions will be also set in the general results of the science of 
language, with especial reference to Greek and Latin. 
Logie and the outlines of moral and political philosophy.—Under the 
head of logic, candidates are recommended to study the following sub- 
jects: The nature and origin of knowledge; the relation of language 
to thought; the elements of the logic of Aristotle, with the history of 
logic in Greece to the time of Aristotle, inclusive; the theory of syllo- 
gism; scientific method, including a comparison of the methods of 
different sciences, and the principles of historical evidence. Ques- 
tions will be set in Bacon’s Novum Organum, Book I and Book II, 
aphorisms 1-20.

-P-A-G-E-884
  826 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Candidates intending to offer any subject not included in the preced- 
ing list must give notice of their intention six months before the exam- 
ination, and obtain the approval of the board of the faculty. 
Examination papers in the honor school of liter humaniores will be 
set from the following texts: 
Plato. Baiter and Orelli (fourth or fifth | Demosthenes. Dindorf, fourth edition, 
edition). cur. Blass (Teubner). 
Aristotle. Niccmachean. Livy. Madvig. 
Ethics. Bywater. Tacitus. Halm (Teubner). 
Aristotle. Other treatises. Bekker, Xenophon. Dindorf. 
Thucydides. Bekker. Plutarch’s Lives. Sintenis. 
Herodotus. Stein. Cicero. Watson. 
Polybius. Strachan Davidson. Sallust. Jordan. 
The examination takes places annually in June, and consists of two 
parts, paper work and viva voce. 
The papers may be classed as follows: 
Subject papers.—Logic (including questions in Aristotle, Bacon, the 
theory of knowledge, of the syllogism, etc.). Moral philosophy (in- 
cluding questions on the Republic and ethics, as well as on modern 
problems and interests). Ancient history and political philosophy 
(including questions on the relations between Greek and Roman history, 
and matters not specially covered by the next two papers enumerated, 
as well as on the four subjects above enumerated). Greek history, 
with reference to the period offered by the candidate. Roman history, 
with reference to the period offered by the candidate. 
Papers in prepared texts.—Greek philosophy texts (usually Republic 
and Ethics). Greek history texts (usually Herodotus, Thucydides, 
Xenophon). Roman history texts (usually Plutarch, Sallust, Cicero, 
Tacitus). 
Scholarship papers.—A passage of English prose for translation into 
Greek prose. A passage of English prose for translation into Latin 
prose. Unprepared passages of Greek and Latin for translation into 
English. 
Special subjects, or extra books.—Candidates may offer special sub- 
jects or extra books in addition to the foregoing, or in compensation for 
some omission. Two papers are generally given in each special subject 
or book offered. 
Three hours are allowed for each paper, and two papers are usually 
given for eachday. The written examination thus lasts five and a half 
days, or thirty-three hours, and occupies the seventh week of the Trinity 
term. The viva voce takes place after an interval of about three weeks, 
in which the examiners are perusing the written work, and is public. 
Each candidate is taken separately in viva voce; some candidates are 
released after a very short examination, either because the papers are 
So poor that there is not much use in trying to improve them by further 
questions, or because the papers are so good that no further questions
-P-A-G-E-885
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 827 
arenecessary. It is in casesof doubt that the questions are continued 
to an hour oreven longer. Questions in philosophy, in history, and in 
the corresponding texts are asked. 
Il, MATHEMATICS. 
The subjects of examination are (1) pure mathematics, (2) mixed 
mathematies. 
The following is the syllabus of the subjects in which candidates 
shall be examined: 
Pure mathematics.—(1) Algebra; (2) trigonometry, plane and spherical; (3) geometry 
of two and three dimensions; (4) differential calculus; (5) integral caleulus; (6) 
calculus of variations; (7) calculus of finite differences; (8) theory of chances. 
Mixed mathematics.—(1) Mechanics of solid and fluid bodies; (2) optics, geometrical 
and physical; (3) astronomy. 
The subjects of the papers in the examination will be as follows: 
Elementary papers.—(1) Algebra and trigonometry; (2) geometry; (3) elementary 
differential and integral calculus, together with solid geometry; (4) elementary 
mechanies and hydrostatics; (5) optics and astronomy. The use of the differ- 
ential and integral calculus to be allowed in papers 4 and 5. 
Advanced papers.—(6, 7,8) Pure mathematics; (9, 10, 11, 12) mixed mathematics; (13) 
problems in pure and mixed mathematics. 
Thirteen papers are given in this examination, and they are upon 
the following subjects: Five elementary papers on algebra and trigo- 
nometry, geometry, differential integral calculus, together with solid 
geometry, elementary mechanics, hydrostatics, optics and astronomy, 
in which four subjects the differential and integral calculus is allowed. 
There are thirteen advanced papers on the subjects of pure and mixed 
mathematics. 
Ill. NATURAL SCIENCE. 
The natural science school is divided into a number of coordinate 
divisions. These are (1) physics, (2) chemistry, (3) geology, (4) animal 
physiology, (5) animal morphology, (6) botany. 
And the final honor examinations in these subjects are preceded by 
certain preliminary examinations, which correspond to some extent 
with the second public examination. 
These preliminary examinations are given in (1) mechanics and 
physics, (2) chemistry, (3) animal physiology, (4) animal morphology, 
(5) botany. 
(1) Physics.—In the preliminary examination candidates are exam- 
ined in certain elementary portions of mechanics, sound, light, heat, 
magnetism, and electricity. Two papers are given. The questions do 
not involve mathematics beyond simple equations, and may as a rule 
be answered from an accurate knowledge of such books as Blaikie’s 
Dynamics and Deschanel’s Ganot’s Elements of Physics. A practical 
examination in physics forms part of the preliminary, in which exami- 
nation the final examination candidates are expected to show an 
accurate general knowledge of physics and are allowed to present
-P-A-G-E-886
  828 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894 95. 
themselves, in addition, for a more detailed exainination in one or more 
of the following branches of the subject: Acoustics, light, heat, elec- 
tricity, and magnetism. 
A practical examination is also given, which lasts for two days, and 
implies a knowledge of the most important physical measurements and. 
methods of investigation. 
The pass schools are held in June and December; the honors schools, 
as arule, only in June. The fee for pass schools is £1 1s. for the first 
subject and 10s. 6d. for every other. For honors, £2 2s., except for 
mathematics, which is £1 11s. 6d. 
After all these examinations the names of successful candidates are 
arranged in classes and publicly posted up. They are then published 
in the University Gazette, and the women’s class list appears here too, 
as also in the university calendar, 
Summing up the position of women, it may be roughly said that all 
the regulations published in the examination statutes (Clarendon 
Press) apply to them equally with men, except those that deal with 
residence, 
These are the regulations for the special women’s honor examina- 
tions: 
No candidate shall be admitted to either part of the second examination for 
woien (onors) who has not passed either (1) responsions (stated subjects), or (2) 
the first examination for women (p. 3), or (3) an examination accepted by the dele- 
gates as exempting therefrom. 
ENGLISH! 
Papers will be set on the prescribed books, on English literature and its history 
to 1820, and on the philology and history of the English language. The following

Chaucer. The Prologue; The Man of nold). 
Lawes Tale (Morris). Byron. Selections (Matthew Arnold.)

language and literature will be held in 1896.
-P-A-G-E-887

A candidate may offer Part I of two languages and Part II of one language in 
two consecutive years. Her performance in the two examinations will be considered 
by the examiners in determining her place in the class list. 
A viva voce examination in these modern languages for such as desire it will be held 
in Oxford. It will comprise writing from dictation, reading aloud, and conversa- 
tion. Candidates who satisfy the examiners in this portion of the examination, as 
well as in that conducted on paper, will have a special note to that effect added to 
their certificates. 
Candidates who pass in this section may, on a future occasion, offer the other 
languages of the section. 
VY. Mreruops or Srupy. 
At Oxford the teaching is partly provided by the university and 
partly by the colleges. There are university lectures given by profes- 
sors and readers and tutors, and collegiate lectures provided by agree- 
ment among the different colleges, in such a way that the instruction 
shall not overlap. These are given by college tutors and lecturers. 
There are college lectures given for members of one college only, and, 
lastly, there are private “coaches” who give special instruction pri- 
vately. This is sometimes required by backward students who need 
help to enable them to keep up with others, but perhaps more often 
for forward students who want to pass on more quickly and be guided 
in their advanced studies. 
A course of lectures usually consists of one, two, or, most commonly, 
three lectures a week, and the delivery of a lecture occupies a little less 
than one hour. The favorite hours for lectures are at 10, 11, and 12, 
but sometimes they are given later in the day. 
A yery large number of university and college lectures are open to 
women; in fact, it is very rarely that they are refused admittance. 
Besides the university lectures, the Association for the Education of 
Women provides lectures that are not provided by the university, 
notably in modern languages. 
Appended is the list of (I) association lectures and (II) university and 
college lectures open to women. It will be seen that the list is a long 
one and that instruction in every subject required is thus supplied.

Tutorial help and advice to students forms an essential part of the 
Oxford system of teaching. This can be obtained in any subject 
required from the tutors of the association, who direct and advise 
students during their university course. This is the list of association 
tutors: 
TUTORS, LECTURERS, AND TEACHERS OF THE ASSOCIATION. 
Litere humaniores.—W. H. Hadow, M. A., tutor. 
Latin and Greek languages and literatwre.—Miss Rogers, A. E. Haigh, M. A., Miss 
Sellar, and Miss Hayllar, tutors and lecturers; A. Sidgwick, M. A.,and F. J. Lys, M. A., 
lecturers. 
Mathematics and physics.—H. T, Gerrans, M. A., tutor and lecturer; Miss Pearson, 
lecturer. 
Natural science.—D. H. Nagel, M. A., and Miss Kirkaldy, tutors. 
Modern history.—J. A. R. Marriott, M. A., tutor and lecturer; Miss Melhuish (B. A., 
Victoria), G. N. Richardson, M. A., and G. H. Wakeling, M. A., tutors; Mrs. Marriott,

These are the regulations concerning tutors of the Association for the 
Education of Women: 
1. Every student reading for an honor or pass school shall be assigned to a tutor 
on commencing her work, and remain under his or her general advice and direction 
until her examination. 
2. The appointment of tutors or other teachers to take tutorial control shall be 
made by the association council, on the recommendation of the educational com- 
mittee. The assignment of students to tutors shall be made by the educational 
committee; and a change of tutor shall only be made at the end of a term. 
3. Tutors shall be consulted about the preparation of the terminal lecture list. 
They shall also advise as to the choice of their pupils’ lectures, and the selection of 
teachers in subjects in which they do not teach themselves. No student shall be 
admitted to any association class or lecture (except such as are asterisked on the 
list) without the recommendation of one of the tutors in the school for which the lec- 
ture is provided. No change in a student’s work shall be made without the knowl- 
edge of her tutor. 
4, Tutors’ recommendations as to individual students’ work shall be communicated 
to the educational committee through the principals. Arrangements as to tutors 
and lecturers shall be made through the lady secretary.
-P-A-G-E-895
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 837 
5. Tutors shall, at the end of each term, send a report to the lady secretary, who 
shall forward it at once to the students’ principal. Tutors shall be entitled to see 
all lecturers’ and teachers’ reports on their pupils before sending in their own. 
6. A tutor who is responsible for a student’s honor work, but is not actually teach- 
ing her, shall be entitled to receive a fee of 10s. per term. 
In the case of the association lectures, weekly essays or compositions 
form part of the work. 
VI. Posrrion or WOMEN. 
The position of women in the University of Oxford can scarcely be 
called precarious, since the social relations are so thoroughly estab- 
lished, and the intercommunication of officers of the board that pro- 
vides for women’s examinations and the officers of the university is so 
complete; yet, on the other hand, it is a friendly rather than a formal 
relation. All the formal recognition given to women students by the 
university is this: 
(1) The hebdomadal council of the university appoints one member 
of the council of the Association for Education of Women. 
(2) The same body appoints one member on the council of Somerville 
College. 
(3) The authorities have given a room in the Dorey official build- 
ings for the office of the association. 
Otherwise the university has no official knowledge of the existence 
of the women. 
Men students are subject to certain regulations. They matriculate, 
reside for a certain number of terms, attend certain lectures, take exam- 
inations in a certain order, receive degrees, and enjoy certain privileges 
as graduate members of the university. None of these arrangements 
are enforced for women by the university. All it does is to grant power 
to the delegacy of local examinations to use the university examina- 
tions in examining women. This is the legal fiction, but the result is 
that women may take any examination provided by the university for 
men. Their names are placed in a class list arranged exactly like that 
of the men, and their position in that list as compared with the men can 
be seen at a glance. In fact, this list is published in the University 
Calendar after that of the men, and also, by statute, in the University 
Gazette. 
As regards residence, the university lays down no rule for women, and 
the delegacy does not inquire into the matter. Consequently, women 
may reside for a short or a long period, or, if they prefer it, not at all. 
On one occasion two ladies from Cambridge, who had won first classes 
in the mathematical tripos (Part I), wishing to test the standard of the 
Oxford final schools, which represent four years of study, as compared 
with that of the tripos, Part I (which represents three years), went to 
Oxford almost directly after their Cambridge examination, entered the 
honor schools, and obtained, respectively, a first and second class. 
Students who belong to one of the halls and registered home students

  838 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
reside for terms which are the same as those kept by members of the 
university, but they are not obliged to take the examinations at certain 
fixed intervals. All that the delegacy expects is certain specified pre- 
liminary examinations in two languages and elementary mathematics; 
those who are graduates of colleges included in the Association of Col- 
legiate Alumne, United States of America, are admitted without fur- 
ther conditions to the honor examinations. Women are allowed a 
larger choice of preliminary examinations than men, and they may, if 
they please, proceed at once to the final honor schools (senior public 
examination), entirely omitting moderations (the first public examina- 
tion), or they may spend all their time working for moderations only. 
This plan has its advantages in regard to its greater freedom, but as 
long as it continues a woman will not obtain the same prestige as a 
man for her work, but will be regarded as having slipped in by a back 
door, leaving out some essential part of the work. There is much to be 
said on both sides; many people in Oxford value the freedom, while 
others consider the existing state of things a serious obstacle in the 
way of recognition by the university. 
As regards lectures, tutorial help, etc., women have little or nothing 
to desire. 
The university grants women neither degrees nor certificates. The 
delegacy, however, grants a certificate, and in the case of the honor 
schools the class obtained is indicated. 
As women do not graduate, they have no recognition from the univer- 
sity when their time of study is ended. However, their position as 
student members of the association helps to keep up their interest in 
Oxford, and gives them a vote on important matters relating to the 
education of women. 
That the present state of things is thoroughly satisfactory no one 
would probably maintain. There is a strong feeling growing up in 
favor of asking something more from the university. Before that can 
be done it will probably be necessary to introduce a little more method 
in the women’s courses, order of examinations, etc. What the next 
step will be it is impossible as yet to say, for the matter is just now 
under discussion. The degree is now granted to women by London, 
Victoria, Wales, and all the Scotch universities, and the Royal Uni- 
versity of Ireland, as well as by the colonial universities. Women have 
already been hampered in attempts to obtain positions in the colonies 
(and sometimes even in England) by lack of the degree. What is 
needed now is to bring home to the old universities the fact that women 
do suffer from their disabilities, and sooner or later they too will yield 
the right to wear the title as generously as they have given the sub- 
stantial benefit of teaching and examination. 
The reasons why a strong feeling has been growing up among the 
friends of women’s education at Oxford that the present state of things 
was unsatisfactory are (1) because of the want of any fixed curriculum,
-P-A-G-E-897
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 839 
which tended to encourage scrappy and unsystematic work; (2) because 
the women who had gone through the full course did not obtain any 
adequate acknowledgment in the form of recognition and a degree. 
In consequence, the Association for the Education of Women in Oxford 
called a meeting in the new schools on May 4, 1895, at which the fol- 
lowing resolutions were carried: 
(1) That it is desirable that women students who havo complied with the condi- 
tions as regards residence and examination should be admitted to the B. A. degree, 
and that a university diploma recording their residence and qualifications should 
be granted to women students who have resided at least three years, have passed a 
preliminary and an intermediate examination, and have obtained a class in any 
honor examination recognized by the university. 
Carried by 115 to 26. 
(2) That this meeting approves of application being now made to the university 
for the admission of duly qualified women to the B. A. degree. 
Carried by 85 to 3. 
As a result of these resolutions, a petition embodying the demands 
of resolution (1) was circulated among members of congregation (which 
is composed of M. A.’s resident at Oxford). In order fully to ascertain 
public opinion, the wording was as follows: 
We, the undersigned members of congregation, respectfully petition the hebdom- 
adal council to bring before the university some scheme whereby resident women 
students may receive due recognition. 
I. By conferring upon those women students who have complied with all the con- 
ditions (of residence and examination) required of men for the B. A. degree, either 
(a) the B. A. degree, or (b) a university diploma stating their residence and qualifi- 
cations, and that they have fulfilled the above conditions; and 
II. By the grant of a university diploma or certificate, stating their residence and 
qualifications, to those women students who have resided at least three years, have 
passed a preliminary and an intermediate examination, and have obtained a class in 
any honor examination recognized in the university. 
I (a) received 123 signatures; I (b), 24. 
As a result of the petition, the hebdomadal council appointed a com- 
mittee to go into the whole matter. This committee decided to take 
the evidence of experts on the following points: 
(1) Whether the exclusion from the B. A. degree has been found to 
injure the professional prospects of women engaged in education; 
instances within experience of witness to be specified. 
(2) Whether the admission of women. to the B. A. degree would be 
likely, and if so, in what way, to injuriously affect the education of 
women. 
Under these headings evidence is now being collected, and will be 
received by the committee in October. After hearing evidence, it is 
probable that the committee will report to the hebdomadal council, and, 
should the report be favorable, the council will probably take further 
steps in the matter. 
It is worth noting that among those who signed I (a) ef the petition 
are the master of Baliol, the principal of Brasenose, the principal of 
Jesus, Professors Burden, Sanderson, Wilson, Dicey, Elliott, Green,
-P-A-G-E-898
  840 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Teggs, Miiller, Poulter, Wallace, Wernghe, and York Powell, besides 
many other influential members of the university. 
Such is the status quo in September, 1895. 
VII. SOMERVILLE COLLEGE. 
Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall were opened on the same 
day, but as Somerville is the larger of the two it may appropriately be 
considered first. It was named, as need not be said, from Mrs. Mary 
Somerville, who was so great an honor to her sex, and who was the 
source of actual contributions to science. A copy of Flaxman’s bust of 
her adorns the hall of each building, and it is proudly related that she 
was not only the first woman admitted to the Royal Society but also 
that she was an excellent housekeeper and fine needlewoman. 
Somerville was originally started as a hall of residence. It was, 
however, incorporated as a college, and in 1894 assumed this title, with 
a view to improving its educational status. 
The situation of the grounds chosen for this hall is convenient. Moy- 
ing from Carfax, the intersection of the two main streets of the city, to 
the north, not more than a five-minutes walk leads one to the unpre- 
tentious gateway, which must be known in order to discover it, for no 
one would suspect that beyond its modest arch lies the avenue leading 
to the beautiful grounds of Somerville. The buildings are placed in a 
garden covering more than 3 acres, which is delightfully wooded and 
with plenty of room for tennis grounds and other amusements, and full 
of quiet retreats in which the student may seek for solitary studying 
hours or where groups of them may entertain their friends in cosy 
outdoor afternoon teas. The buildings consist of the old hall, origi- 
nally a large dwelling hcuse, with additions and the West buildings, 
which were put up several years after the original building was first 
opened. The new parts are in the Jacobian style, and each of the 
buildings is complete in itself, with its own dining and drawing rooms, 
library and offices, so that there are really two centers of home life in 
the place. There are also several cottages opening upon the grounds, 
which are used for the accommodation of students, the young ladies 
living in them going to one of the other buildings for their meals and 
for their social relations. About 65 students can be accommodated in 
the whole place, but as this number is divided into two home centers, 
many of the evils resulting in the conditions incident to life in large 
and crowded halls are much lessened, if they are not completely done 
away with. 
The drawing-room in the old hall is a large and comfortable room, 
with a delightful aspect upon the garden, and with a large window 
door from which one steps directly upon the lawn. The ever-present 
fireplace is an attractive feature, comfortable sleepy-hollow chairs invit- 
ing to its warmth in winter. The walls are lined with beautiful pic- 
tures, Watts and Burne-Jones, according to the fashion of the time,
-P-A-G-E-899
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 84i 
being represented; and some beautiful gifts by Mr. Ruskin are also 
among the number. <A series of beautiful photographs of those Italian 
ladies that were lecturers and ‘“ dottoresse” in the Italian university 
appropriately adorn one side of the room. A large portrait of the first 
principal of the hall hangs over the fireplace. 
The library is on the second floor. It contains about 3,000 volumes, 
and is a sort of common room for the students, containing magazines 
and the newspapers, which the English girl does not fail daily to read. 
Upon the wall, near the door of this room, is the bulletin board, covered 
thickly with notices of the various meetings and clubs which the stu- 
dents keep up and attend. A special building is to be provided for the 
library as soon as possible. 
The rooms of the young ladies are here, as in all the Oxford women’s 
colleges, a sort of half study, half boudoir. The furniture provided by 
the hall consists of a single bed, which may be converted by artistic 
coverings into a couch by day; a study desk and bookcase, commode 
and screen, with several comfortable chairs; but each student adds to 
this simple outfit a large number of additions and touches, which con- 
vert the room into something that shall represent her own individ- 
uality. She may carry out in fancy what she pleases, from the severest 
simplicity to the wildest exuberance of draperies, flowers, and pictures. 
Watts’s Hope and Rossetti’s Beata Beatrix and Sancta Lilias will there 
be found in many repetitions, and the corner where the books are piled 
will have above it a pair of tennis racquets crossed. A pair of screens 
gives the drawing-room effect to the chamber by day, and upon the low 
table are the delicate china cups which are to serve when the afternoon 
tea or the 10 o’clock cocoa is the order of the day or evening. 
The principal of the hall is a woman of great energy, tact, and 
administrative capacity, one whose enthusiasm is felt by all who come 
under her influence. She has large ambitions for the hall, and through 
her efforts it has greatly increased in numbers and in gifts that have 
been brought to its library and its fund for scholarships. While 
encouraging scholarship in all possible ways, she is laudably careful 
for the physical health of the young women under her care, and takes 
the deepest interest in all matters that will be for their personal welfare. 
There are three ladies residing in the halls who act as tutors to the 
students, and there are four other nonresident tutors. No lectures, 
however, are given in the halls; all the students go for lectures either 
to the association hall or to the different colleges in which the lectures 
are given, accompanied always by an approved chaperone. 
Somerville College is already old enough to boast of the honors that 
have been gained by its inmates, and it is interesting to see in each yearly 
report an account given not only of the honors that have been received 
in their examinations in Oxford but of the positions that they have 
gained as head mistresses or lecturers in other institutions. There is 
no doubt also that the alumne look back to the lal] in which they lived 
ED 95. 27%

  842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
and studied with very much the same sentiment that American students 
regard their alma mater. 
Somerville Hall is strictly undenominational in principle, and the 
report declares that care is taken in its management to place members 
of different religious denominations on the same footing. Prayers are 
read daily in the hall, but students are not required to attend. The 
students are, however, expected to attend on Sundays a place of wor- 
ship chosen by themselves or their parents, and to inform the principal 
what place of worship they choose for regular attendance; but this rule 
is one to which exception would be allowed. 
It is to ke feared that the American students coming to this or any 
other of the English colleges or college halls will find the particular 
rules given for their guidance in regard to conduct somewhat restric- 
tive. These rules pertain to matters which an American young lady 
is supposed to take care of herself without special directions. Cer- 
tainly nothing is mentioned which the instinct of a lady will not sug- 
gest as in the main proper and best to do, and when one realizes the 
seare that is exercised in the best English homes over the comings in 
and goings out of daughters, one sees that these directions laid down 
for college women can not be considered revolutionary or even unusual. 
The English students themselves do not find them troublesome in the 
least; in fact, many of them have more liberty in the college life than 
they had at home. Some of the rules that are distinctly named are as 
follows: 
No student is to be out after sunset without leave. Invitations from 
friends may not be accepted without consulting the principal. Students 
must be in their own rooms by 11 p.m. Evening engagements should 
not be made more than once a week. Students may not invite gentle- 
men to their own rooms nor receive them there if they come. Students 
may not accept invitations to the rooms of members of the university 
or enter any such rooms except under: special circumstances and with 
the sanction of the principal. 
It is not to be supposed from these last two restrictions that there 
would be any great danger of their infraction or that they have been 
made in order to interfere with a growing custom. It has, however, 
long been an established university form for college men to have always 
a parlor in their suite of rooms, in which it is considered proper for them 
to entertain ladies at lunches or afternoon teas; but it would hardly 
seem necessary to suggest that young ladies should not go to enter- 
tainments of this sort unless accompanied by elderly ladies. It is 
required that the chaperone who accompanies ladies on any of these 
occasions shall be one whom the principal herself knows, or whom the 
student’s mother knows, and the gentleman whose room is visited 
must be one known by the parents of the young ladies themselves. 
This is an absolute law, that if calls by gentlemen are received at the 
hall, the card is sent to.Miss Maitland, and the drawing-room is the
-P-A-G-E-901
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 843 
place where the guest is entertained. It can not be said that there is 
a rule against the reception of more than one call in the term from the 
same gentleman, but the principal’s sententious answer to the question 
on this point was, “It does not happen.” There are various unwritten 
rules: Young ladies may not walk on the towing path; they may 
not go into college gardens; when going to lectures or to the shops 
two young ladies shall go together; they may not go to the Camera 
after dinner or to week-day college chapels unless special permission 
is obtained from the principal. To the rule that they may not go to 
college or other dances there is absolutely no exception. These par- 
ticulars are given in order to show the amount and kind of care that 
is exercised over the conduct of young women, and to which English 
girls can not be said to make objection. It has also been said that 
American women do not find, when they come to English colleges, 
that they are very much inconvenienced, under the circumstances, by 
the rules of the institutions. 
The general impression which a company of English women makes 
is that of physical vigor. There are of course exceptions, but in the 
main the English habit of activity in pedestrianism seems to have 
brought about its legitimate result. It is an understood thing that the 
time from lunch to afternoon tea shall be spent in games or other out- 
door exercise, and the days are very few in the whole English year 
when it would be impossible on account of the weather to take a long 
walk. The vicinity of Oxford could not be surpassed in convenience 
for this method of increasing physical vigor; the roads are excellent, 
and the scenery, while always quiet, is sufficiently attractive to prevent 
any walk from being dull. For the rare days when it is impossible to 
go out, a small gymnasium is provided, which is, however, sufficient 
for the number of those that use it. It is provided with appliances 
for all kinds of exercise, including fencing, and a sergeant acts as 
instructor. 
It must be admitted, however, that the application of the latest and 
best science to the needs of young women has not here progressed very 
far. / 
The students have also a boat on the Cherwell, and are required to 
pass a swimming test of 50 feet before using it. Nearly all of the 
young ladies at Somerville have passed this test. 
The daily routine will not vary much in the different halls. Pray- 
ers are read at 8 o’clock, and breakfast may be taken from 8.10 to 9. 
The time from 9 to 1 is spent usually at work, and the devotion of the 
students to work hours is something to be noted. The students during 
this time are either in their rooms studying, or attending lectures in the 
various colleges or the association rooms, or at the Bodleian Library. 
Between 1 and 2 lunch may be obtained; this is a very informal meal. 
From 2 o’clock till afternoon tea, boating, tennis, and other games are 
the order; from 4 to 5 tea is to be had in the drawing-reom, and 5 to 7
-P-A-G-E-902
  844 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
is considered again a work hour. At dinner students are expected to 
be punctual, and evening dress is en régle. 
The evening may be spent in study, but this is also the time for the 
various kinds of entertainments which the students get up. They are 
concerts, private theatricals and charades, and the meetings of the 
various societies. At the Browning Society, the Shakespeare Society, 
the Scientific and Philosophie Society, papers are presented and dis- 
cussed on subjects whose general character may be indicated by the 
names of the associations. The Mermaid Society, named from the 
famous tavern, is organized for the study of general literature. There 
are also various meetings connected with philanthropic missions in 
which the students are interested. One of these is the university 
settlement in Southwark, London, which is supported by the college 
women of Oxford and Cambridge together. Another is a mission in 
the Transvaal, for which a former Somerville student has aroused their 
sympathy. The Knitting Society which made hand-knit jerseys for 
North Sea fishermen is now extinct, but no one can calculate when either 
it or another of the same fanciful sort may break out. But perhaps 
most important of all is the Debating Society. In this society the 
students of Somerville and Lady Margaret halls unite their efforts. 
The meetings are held alternately at Somerville and Lady Margaret, 
and it must be said that no subject is too wide or too deep for it to 
handle; the laws of science and the policy of great statesmen come in 
for their share of discussion. All the political questions of the time 
are settled and decided in these debates; and the more paradoxical 
the expression of the question, the more interesting the debate, the 
main object being to provoke discussion. The “honorable proposer” 
opens by a written address; the “honorable opposer” follows with a 
written response. All members of the society are then permitted and 
urged to take part in the more or less exciting discussion. The vote 
is taken not on the merits of the debate but on the merits of the ques- 
tion. The greatest interest is felt in the Debating Society, and it has 
been proposed that the Debating Society of the women’s colleges at 
Cambridge should unite with the Debating Society of Oxford in an 
interuniversity debate. In fact, a beginning has been made in this 
direction and will no doubt be carried out, to the great increase of 
interest in this admirable method of culture. 
The dates of terms at Somerville correspond with the university terms. 
The students are not admitted under the age of 17, and in case the 
responsions or some equivalent examination has not been passed a 
special examination will be required by the principal, in order to show 
whether the candidate is qualified to profit by the course of study 
proposed. This examination is upon algebra or Euclid and any two 
languages of the following: Latin, Greek, French (or Italian), and 
German. The papers are sent to the candidate and done at her home 
“upon honor,”
-P-A-G-E-903
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 845 
A letter of introduction and recommendation from some person who 
knows about the courses of study that have been pursued by the candi- 
date will, however, in many cases be sufficient. References are always 
- required, and special pains are taken at the hall in regard to the 
reception of persons that have been in houses where there has been 
any infectious disease within the preceding month. The card of appli- 
eation for admission calls for the name of the candidate in full; the 
name, address, and profession of the parent or guardian; date of birth; 
the church desired; statement in regard to health; account of previous 
education, giving the name and address of the principal of the school 
last attended; the amount of examinations that have been passed, and 
the names and addresses of two referees, of whom one shall be a lady; 
the name of the former schoolmistress, or of the clergyman in the 
town where the candidate has lived, or of some other person of recog- 
nized position, will be accepted as referee. 
Inclusive fees are charged for board, lodging, tuition, and lectures. 
These are £28 12s. 4d. a term, to be paid in advance; for rooms in the 
wing and West buildings an éxtra charge of £2 2s. is made. Cottage 
rooms are £26 a term. Students are expected to give three months’ 
notice before leaving. Failing this, they are liable to be charged for 
the ensuing term, subject to the discretion of the principal. 
There are, of course, various small expenses connected with the 
different associations with which the students are connected, but most 
of them are optional. Then there is laundry, which would not amount 
to more than 2s. (50 cents) a week, and, of course, there are the students’ 
own books to be bought. If friends are invited to dinner there is a 
charge of 2s.-6d. and for lunch 1s, 6d. 
There are a certain number of scholarships offered by the college; 
three of the annual value of £50 and tenable for three years, given by 
the Clothworkers’ Company. There is also a Pfeifer scholarship (£50 
a year) and a Pfeifer exhibition, and a St. Mary Conybeare scholarship 
(£50) for classies. 
VIII. Lapy MarGarer Hat. 
In the year 1879 it was decided to establish a second hall for women, 
which should have the special object of providing a home for the 
daughters of people who were connected with the Church of England. 
The proposed hall was announced as “an academical house of the 
members of the Church of England (with provision for the liberty of 
members of other religious bodies), which should secure to students the 
advantages of a common life with the ways and tone of a Christian 
family; the production of certain rules as to hours established, etc., 
general supervision of students, definite religious instruction, the advice 
and assistance of a lady of experience and other high qualifications 
acting as lady principal.” 
A house was taken in Norham Gardens, a street in the new part of 
Oxford, where a constant succession of beautiful villas, embowered in
-P-A-G-E-904
  846 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
greenery and surrounded by gardens, lines the graceful winding streets. 
Lady Margaret Hall may be a fifteen-minutes walk from Carfax; itis in 
the outskirts of the city, and the view from the upper windows looks out 
over the fields and meadows leading down to the Cherwell. The house 
does not differ in its appearance from the surburban residences that 
surround it. It stands close to the street, but a beautiful garden of 
moderate size at the back affords room for a tennis courtortwo. Across 
the street from the hall is a second house which is really a part of the 
hall, and which is called Wordsworth Hostel. The hostel is named 
from Miss Wordsworth, the principal of the hall, and the hall itself is 
named from Margaret Tudor, Countess of Richmond. A cast of her 
recumbent figure on the beautiful tomb in Westminster Abbey has 
been placed in the chapel of the hall. The dwelling house which was 
taken in the first place for the hall was increased by the addition of 
several rooms and a small chapel. The chapelis a small room, but it 
has received various rich decorations as gifts from friends of the hall. 
A valuable and interesting thirteenth-century picture ascribed to 
Gaddo Gaddi has been placed over the altar. Some gifts of candle- 
sticks and vases, altar linen, and other appropriate furnishings, together 
with the marble pavement and beautiful windows of stained glass, not 
by any means forgetting the cast of the namesake of the hall, which 
lies to the left of the altar, give to some extent the appropriate effect 
for a chapel and tone down the newness of the general appearance. 
The drawing-room at the hall is a beautiful apartment, whose win- 
dows look out upon the lawn at the back. Its walls are lined with 
pictures, and the air of the room is that of comfort and elegance. All 
that has been said of the rooms of the students at Somerville may be 
repeated for this hall also, but as Lady Margaret is a smaller place, only 
about twenty persons being accommodated within the hall itself, it 
is easier to give the freedom of a home to its inmates than where 
larger numbers are congregated. It is the special aim of the principal 
that Lady Margaret should have the air of a home, At present the 
total number of students accommodated is 38, but fresh accommoda- 
tions for students, ete., dining hall, and library are contemplated. 
Miss Wordsworth is the daughter of the late Dr. Wordsworth, Bishop 
of Lincoln, a lady known for her literary ability and scholarship as well 
as for her socialcharm. The brightness and grace that she introduces 
into the conversation whenever she joins the group are always wel- 
comed, and her friends say that she always carries the conversation to 
a higher plane as soon as she enters. Of a deeply religious nature, it 
must be that her life and character make a deep impression upon the 
young women who are under herinfluence. She herself reads the prayers 
atthe night and morning chapel and conducts the classes which are held 
weekly in religious knowledge, and which all the students in the hall 
attend. The subject for these classes and Bible study changes from 
year to year. One year they were in the Gospel of St. Mark, another
-P-A-G-E-905
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 847 
on the Decalogue and the Book of Joshua, and the next on St. Luke’s 
Gospel. The statement in the house rules that students are expected 
to be at prayers morning and evening and to attend divine service at 
least once on Sundays has the force of a command; and the Holy Com- 
munion is celebrated in the chapel of the hall once a term. Lenten 
addresses are given there also, and courses of lectures by various rey- 
erend gentlemen are given in the association rooms, which the students 
have the advantage of attending. Through all these means which are 
placed at the command of the students by the principal and by the ofii- 
cers of government for the hall, it is hoped to give a cast to the life in 
this hall which shall be specially felt by those who are members of the 
Church of England, and it is the desire of the principal that a high 
tone of character may be the result in the students. 
In regard to the discipline of the house and the daily routine of life, 
there are not many differences between Lady Margaret and Somerville. 
If possible, the students are thrown upon their own responsibility a 
trifle less at Lady Margaret. Some rules which are left to thé power 
of tradition only at Somerville are distinctly expressed at Lady Mar- 
garet. Students are expected to be in their rooms for the night at 
half past 10, nor should they visit each other’s rooms before 1 p. m. 
The rules about going two and two and about walking ou the towing 
path, or in college gardens, or going to week-day college chapels, are 
definitely expressed. Visitors other than fathers, uncles, and brothers 
may be received on Monday afternoons only between 4 and 6. No 
student may accept invitations from gentlemen unknown by her parents, 
or from residents unknown to her parents or the lady principal. 
Besides the lawn-tennis court and the two boats on the Cherwell, 
which may be used by students who have passed the swimming test, 
there is a small gymnasium, No student may use the boats, however, 
without leave from her parent or guardian, and special permission 
must always be obtained from the principal. 
The dates for the terms at Lady Margaret Hall correspond with 
those of the university, and the conditions of admission are the same 
as at Somerville. Each student has a room to herself, as at Somerville, 
which is fitted to serve as sitting room and bedroom. The charges are 
£75 a year for each student, exclusive of expenses strictly personal. 
There are the usual number of societies and other miscellaneous matters 
that call upon the student for slight fees; an estimate of about 10s. a 
term, with 2s. a week for laundry expenses, would be fair. 
The fees for instruction are paid to the association, and will not exceed 
as a generalthing £8aterm., As these are not included in the £75, resi- 
dence here is considerably dearer than at Somerville. In case of sisters 
or other ladies willing to share the same room, £65 a year would be the 
price for each. Three months’ notice before leaving is required. There 
are various scholarships, information in regard to which may be obtained 
by addressing the principal. They vary in amount from £50 to £25. 
The scholarship examination is held at the hall each June.

IX. St. Huen’s Hay. 
Another hall, charmingly situated at 17 Norham Gardens, in the near 
vicinity of Lady Margaret Hall, has also been established. It has been 
in existence for eight years, and has been designed specially for young 
ladies who wish to gain the advantages of university education on an 
inexpensive scale. The name of St. Hugh was given to the hall in 
memory of the great Bishop of Lincoln, of whose diocese Oxford formed 
a part, and who is said to have had a remarkable reverence for women. 
A window in St. Giles’ Church bears his name, and his figure, with that 
of his favorite swan, is to be seen on the northeast pinnacle of the spire 
of St. Mary’s. The idea of this hall suggested itself to Miss Words- 
worth, the principal of Lady Margaret, in consequence of her receiv- 
ing applications from many students, notably the daughters of the 
clergy, who could not afford the fees paid at Lady Margaret Hall, but 
who it was thought would be content with a less luxurious rate of living 
in order to share the same educational privileges. The economy appears 
in the arrangement of rooms. Two students are expected to share a 
bedroom, which is divided by screens, and which it is not expected will 
require heat; the bedroom fire is considered an extra. The students 
have a large study room, charmingly situated, with an outlook upon the 
tennis ground and the woods beyond, and in this room each student has 
a desk to herself, where she keeps her own books and papers and at 
which she sits for study. Silence is positively required in this room, 
and nothing can be more cheery than the well-lighted and comfortable 
apartment. St. Hugh’s Hall is now being enlarged, and in October, 
1892, there will be room for 24 students. There will be 8 rooms which 
are “share” rooms, and there will also be 14 single bedrooms and 2 
small singlerooms. The price forthe share bedrooms is £45 a year for 
each person, including board, and the occupants will be expected to 
work in the study. The price for the single rooms is £65 a year, and 
this includes two scuitlefuls of coal, which is considered a sufficient 
quantity. For a small single room the price is £55 a year. The stu- 
dents are requested to bring sheets, towels, pillowcases, toilet soap, ete. 
St. Hugh’s Hall is, like Lady Margaret Hall, intended primarily for the 
benefit of members of the Church of England; the religious teaching 
is on the same lines as that at Lady Margaret Hall. A tiny chapel is 
provided, and the service of the Church of England is used. Members 
of other religious bodies, however, are not debarred from admission. 
The rates mentioned above do not, of course, include the lecture fees, 
which vary from £15 to £24 a year, and are payable to the General Asso- 
ciation for Women’s Education. In case any students have not passed 
the Oxford first examination for women, an equivalent examination 
is provided which they are required to pass in order to be admitted. 
This need not be detailed, for the studies here, in all things connected 
with lectures, are on exactly the same footing as those at Somerville
-P-A-G-E-907
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 849 
and at Lady Margaret Hall. Good references are required and a stu- 
dent is expected to remain no less than a year. AJl students who can 
swim 50 feet are allowed the use of the St. Hugh’s boat on the Cherwell. 
St. Hugh’s is under the supervision of Miss ©. E. A. Moberly, a 
charming and cultivated lady, whose grace of manner and interest in 
her charge peculiarly fit her for the responsible post which she holds. 
She can be addressed at St. Hugh’s Hall, 17 Norham Gardens, or in 
the vacation at The Parsonage, Sydenham, London, SE. 
REGISTERED HOME STUDENTS. 
Students who wish to work in connection with the association and 
yet not to reside at one of the halls may be registered as “home stu- 
dents.” A special cominittee has been appointed take charge of them, 
the principal being Mrs. A. H. Johnson (8 Merton street, Oxford). Cer- 
tain regulations are laid down with regard to their work. These are: 
1. Students wishing to attend lectures not open to the public must send in their 
applications on the prescribed forms, duly signed, to the lady secretary of the Asso- 
ciation for the Education of Women. 
2. Students should consult the principal before arranging for tutorial assistance. 
3. Students must pay their fees direct to the treasurer of the Association for the 
Education of Women. : 
Students, unless residing with parents or guardians, must obtain leave from the 
principal to reside in other houses approved by the committee, and are required to 
conform to certain rules. 
Students of a hall who wish to leave the hall, but to continue to reside in Oxford 
as students of the Association for the Education of Women, and home students who 
wish to enter a hall must obtain permission from the authorities of the hall and 
from the home students’ committee. 
X. THe LIBRARIES. 
If there were nothing else in Oxford to make it worth while for a 
student to go there, the Bodleian would still be an attraction amply 
sufficient to make pilgrimages to it as a worthy shrine interesting. 
The collection of buildings of which the Bodleian and the Radcliffe 
library buildings form a part is one of the most attractive in the 
world, not because of their architectural beauty alone, but because of 
their endless historic associations and the graceful variety in their 
arrangement and proportions. Entering the inclosure of the Divinity 
Schools from the arched passage in the center of the Clarendon Building, 
one feels in the very atmosphere of the Middle Ages. The inscriptions 
over the doorways which lead out from this square record the-divisions 
of subjects of study which were used in the days when Aristotle was, if 
possible, even more the ruler of the philosophical disputations than he is 
now. One might, in fact, believe thatif there were wild boars roaming 
in the forests of Oxfordshire at the present day (if, indeed, there were 
any forests left for them to roam in), the wandering student, out in 
search of philosophic seclusion, might still be found, “Ethics” in hand, 
to drive his book down the throat of the beast in case of an attack.
-P-A-G-E-908
  850 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-95. 
Litere Humanores is rightly named the “Greats” in the slang of the 
university town, for while there are but 12 courses of lectures offered in 
mathematics, there are 124 more or less closely related with the clas- 
sics, and the explanation of those cabalistic inscriptions over the doors 
in this ancient quadrangle will perhaps also make clear why the Uni- 
versity of Oxford still considers classical history and classical phi- 
losophy as the “more human” instruction. Under the low doorway 
which is marked “Schola vetus Medicine” one enters a winding stair- 
case that leads to the Bodleian proper, but the room where most of 
the reading and studying is done is further beyond the square of the 
Divinity Schools, in the “Camera,” or Radcliffe Building. The open 
space in which this noble building stands has toward the east the 
beautiful fagade of All Souls, with its many delicate turrets; beyond, 
toward the south, is the church of St. Mary’s, the university church; 
and toward the west is Brasenose College, the back of the gardens of 
Exeter, with the far-spreading branches of Bishop Heber’s beloved 
horse-chestnut tree extending over the wall and casting a deep shade 
upon the square. The Radcliffe Library, which is now called the 
“Camera Bodleiana,” is a beautiful octagon in its ground plan; above 
this it is cylindrical, with Corinthian columns about it, and is crowned 
with a majestic dome, beneath which is the reading room. The lower 
part of the building is filled with books, chiefly those that have been 
published since 1850. The Camera or reading room itself is reached by 
a long winding flight of stone steps. It would be hardly possible to 
imagine a more delightful place for study. The lighting is excellent 
and the room is always absolutely quiet. In the center of the room is 
a table on which are placed the very latest books, such as have not yet 
been catalogued, and several other circular reading tables, on which 
are the last received numbers of many leading periodicals, both English 
and foreign. Large cases hold the books which contain the catalogue; 
other cases contain several thousand selected books, carefully chosen 
and continually kept up to date, which may be taken without applying 
to the librarian and used in that room. These are the books which are 
most used, and are always kept conveniently at hand. Books may be 
brought between 10 o’clock in the morning and 10 at night to this room 
from the rooms below by the clerks, or between 10 in the morning and 
5 in the afternoon from the Bodleian itself, on application through a 
ecard, copies of which are found upon the tables. The book when drawn 
may be retained in the reserved shelves for a week under the name of 
the student, but no books are ever taken away from the library. In 
the compartments around the sides of the room are desks and tables 
conveniently arranged and supplied with pens and ink and paper. 
These study compartments are well lighted and comfortable. There is 
also a gallery to which books for immediate use are taken for the use 
of students in special subjects. 
But if the Camera is a delightful place for study, the reading cells
-P-A-G-E-909
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 851 
and cages in which the students sit in the Bodleian Library itself may 
be called the very home and retreat of scholastic research. Every 
thought of busy and strenuous life seems to retire far hence when one 
comes into the deep hush and classic shade of this room. Entering 
again by a long staircase, one finds a narrow room surrounded by book- 
cases, and with cases in the center containing the prodigious volumes 
of the catalogue, and where also stand a great many glass-covered com- 
partments in which rare and treasured works are shown. Crossing from 
this room to another, similarly formed, is along hall, leading from which, 
upon either side, are many book-lined reading stalls filled with comfort- 
able desks and chairs provided with appliances for writing. To these 
places are brought the volumes of texts or other valuable works which 
are the object of study, and they may be left, with the name of the 
reader, for a week or longer. The light comes in through gothic win- 
dows; the ceiling is covered with armorial decorations; pictures of 
ancient worthies are hung about the walls, and the whole atmosphere 
is filled with the associations of ancient days. 
The catalogue of the library, a copy of which is kept at the Camera 
and at the Bodleian alse, consists of a large number of books of immense 
size and of great weight, upon whose heavy leaves are pasted tissue 
slips containing the name, author, and mark of each book. It is an 
authors catalogue; but a subject catalogue is in process of prepara- 
tion, and an arrangement of departments has been begun upon a sys- 
tem approaching the well-known decimal system. ‘The work is in 
embryo as yet, and proceeds very slowly, since it consists of a mere 
rearrangement of the tissue slips that are used for the authors cata- 
logue. The idea seems not to have much more than dawned on the Old 
World that the tremendous increase in usefulness of a library with a 
thorough subject catalogue based on an expansible decimal system that 
touches and includes all the departments of human knowledge, that 
has been written on stiff cards easily handled and placed in drawers as 
high as the average height of a human being, amply repays the labors 
of some scores of trained cataloguers for a term of years. But the 
subject catalogue, as far as it does go, is of course exceedingly useful. 
Readers desiring to consult any section of the catalogue may do so by 
filling in a special printed slip and handing it to the librarian. At the 
Bodleian for some of the special collections there are also special cata- 
logues, and there are also some classified hand lists. A catalogue of 
the 27,000 volumes of manuscripts in the library has been begun, and 
thirteen parts of it have been published. 
In the use of the library much depends upon the spirit with which 
the application of the student for information may be received, and it 
is a great pleasure to say that one finds in Oxford a library in which 
the ideal seems to be that students shall be able to find what they 
want-——that the books are to be used, and not to be simply stored away. 
The courtesy and interest ef the librarians and clerks can searcely be
-P-A-G-E-910
  852 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
surpassed, and while it does seem strange that the subject catalogue 
should not have been long since completed and put into operation, it is 
so extraordinary a thing in a European library to find one even begun, 
or the idea of one even thought of, that it is most refreshing to see this 
important element in the usefulness of a library begun and an effort 
being made to bring it into complete use. 
Admission to the library proper at the Radcliffe Camera is open to 
women on application for a printed form and having this filled by the 
signature of some master of arts. Any sufficiently respectable intro- 
duction will make it possible for a person who purposes serious study 
to have the use of the library. There is no special delay about it, and 
ladies will never feel any difference in the treatment that they receive 
from that which would be accorded to men. Readingis done chiefly in 
the Camera, but where any special book, especially one published before 
the middle of the present century, is to be used for a long time, the 
reader is expected to retire to one of the reading stalls in the Bodleian 
itself. 
The library contains at present 475,000 bound volumes of printed 
works besides the 27,000 manuscripts. It is increasing very fast and 
will doubtless soon overflow the buildings devoted to it. With the 
leave of the librarian or curators, manuscripts may be copied and pub- 
lished. The galleries of the Bodleian contain a collection of historical 
portraits and a large number of other interesting things. The Ash- 
molean Museum is in a building near the library and contains many 
interesting collections—historical, archeological, etc. 
At the Taylorian Institution there is also a large library, consisting 
chiefly of books in foreign languages. This library may be used by 
getting the signature of two masters of arts. The printed request, with 
these signatures, is laid before the committee, and about two weeks later 
the permission is given. The library is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
throughout the year, except from August 16 to September 14, and books 
may also be taken out. 
At the Radcliffe library proper, which is placed now in the university 
museum, there is also a large collection of books on special subjects. 
This library is for the benefit of scientific students. Books are arranged 
in subjects. (1) Philosophy, (2) mathematics, (3) astronomy, (4) physics, 
(5) chemistry, (6) mineralogy, (7) geology, (8) voyages and travels, (9) 
biological science, including human anatomy, anthropology, compara- 
tive anatomy, embryology, (1) medicine, (11) biographies. Many large 
illustrated works of importance are in the reading room, and cases 
containing transactions and proceedings of academies, journals relating 
to special scientific subjects, and a collection of standard books for 
immediate use. The library is open from 10 a. in. to 6 p. m. during term, 
and in vacation from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Readers are admitted to the 
library and reading room on the introduction of a professor. 
The various colleges and halls have also libraries of their own, to be
-P-A-G-E-911
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 853 
used by their members. While the libraries in the halls for women are 
confessedly inadequate, they are constantly receiving additions and 
will no doubt be greatly increased in the near future. The library at 
All Souls College, a special library for the law department, may be 
used by women. 
The city library is also open for the use of all who get their tickets 
of request signed by two ratepayers of the city. There are also several 
circulating libraries. 
WOMEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. 
I. HistortcaL INTRODUCTION. 
The admission of women to study at Cambridge is due to a double 
movement, which, starting with different aims, at last coincided in an 
endeavor to place the work of women students on lines exactly parallel 
to those of the men. 
The founders of Girton College had, from the first, a definite aim, 
which they pursued consistently, in spite of all difficulties. This aim 
is thus expressed: 
This college is designed to hold, in relation to girls’ schools and home teaching, a 
position analogous to that occupied by the universities toward the public schools 
for boys. 
The memorandum of association contains this clause: 
The objects for which the association is established are to erect, maintain, and con- 
duct a college for the higher education of women; to take such steps as from time to 
time may be thought most expedient and effectual to obtain for the students of the 
college admission to the examinations for degrees of the University of Cambridge, 
and generally to place the college in connection with that university. 
The promoters put their trust in the generosity of an enlightened 
public; and it was not misplaced. It was decided to raise the sum 
required for building and other preliminary expenses by public subserip- 
tion and by the sale of a limited number of presentations. The first list 
was headed by Madame Bodichon with £1,000 ($5,000). The author of 
Romola appears in the same list with a donation of £50 ($250). One 
of the first and most liberal benefactors was the late Lady Stanley of 
Alderney, while Miss Emily Davies was the mainspring of enthusiasm. 
While a building was being constructed near Cambridge a small 
attempt was made at Hitchin, about 20 miles from Cambridge. Here 
a house was hired in 1869, and 6 students entered. Miss Emily Davies, 
who had done so much to promote the scheme, became mistress in 1872, 
Thirteen was the largest number of students ever in attendance at 
one time at Hitchin. From the very first, in spite of all difficulties in 
the way of obtaining tuition and the insufficient preparation of some 
of the students, such regulations in regard to residence and order of 
examinations as were imposed on men students were followed by the 
women, and-the course of study was that for the honors examinations
-P-A-G-E-912
  854 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of the University of Cambridge. Distinguished professors, e. g., Pro- 
fessor Seeley and Dr. Hort, came over to Hitchin to lecture, and by the 
kindness of the examiners the lady students were examined informally 
by the same paperg as were set for the men, and the result of the exami- 
nation was informally made known. Thus the very first woman who took 
atripos examination had fulfilled every condition that would entitle 
her to a degree had she been a man. In 1872 the association that had 
started the work was incorporated as Girton College. In October, 
1873, the college was removed to Cambridge. The numbers gradually 
increased and the building received additions from time to time. The 
students continued to pass examinations informally until the year 1881, 
when the university for the first time took steps to acknowledge the 
women students. 
The aim of Newnham was at first different. It proposed to attract 
to Cambridge women who wished to continue their studies, but did not 
specially aim at following the academic courses or at passing the uni- 
versity examinations. Miss A. J. Clough had, as early as 1865, con- 
ceived a scheme for starting in large towns courses of lectures for 
girls and teachers. Liverpool was the first center at which such lec- 
tures were given. In 1869 Cambridge started the higher local examina- 
tions for women over 18, The result of this was a need for higher 
instruction, and in 1870 courses of lectures to women were first deliv- 
ered in Cambridge, about 70 or 80 joining at once. In order to attract 
large numbers of students and to accommodate those who came from 
other parts, it was arranged to provide a house of residence, and this 
was the nucleus of Newnham College. In 1880 Newnham College was 
formed by the amalgamation of the association for providing lectures 
for women in Cambridge and the association for providing a hall of 
residence for women attending the lectures. The articles of the asso- 
ciation contain the following: 
To establish and maintain at or near Cambridge a house or residence or houses 
and residences in which women students may reside and study. 
To provide for the instruction of women students and for the delivery of lectures 
to such students or to other women at or near Cambridge. 
The first students of Newnham usually worked for the higher local 
examinations, or simply pursued their studies with no definite exami- 
nation aim. A very few entered for the tripos examinations, and 
passed them informally, but no attempt was made rigidly to follow the 
regulations as to residence and preliminary examinations that were 
imposed on the men. It was the formal acknowledgment of the 
Women’s College by the university in 1881 that brought the work ot 
Girton and Newnham into accord. There are still some slight differ- 
ences which will be dealt with under their special headings. 
II. PRESENT POSITION Or WOMEN. 
In the year 1881 the women’s colleges received their first formal 
acknowledgment from the university. In 1880 the remarkable success
-P-A-G-E-913
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 855 
of Miss C. A. Scott, now professor of mathematics at Bryn Mawr, in 
the examination of the mathematical tripos, attracted considerable 
attention to Girton and the work done there; and as a result the col- 
lege decided to join in an appeal to the university to, open the examina- 
tions formally and grant the degrees to women. This appeal was partly 
successful. Although the degrees were refused, a syndicate appointed 
for the purpose presented a report which was accepted by a very large 
majority. On the main clauses the voting was 398 in favor to 32 
against. The main features of the “graces” passed by the senate are 
the following: 
1. Female students who have fulfilled the conditions respecting 
length of residence and standing which members of the university are 
required to fulfill may be admitted to the previous examinations and 
to the tripos examinations. 
2. Such residence shall be held at (a) Girton College, or at (b) Newn- 
ham College, or (¢) within the precincts of the university under the 
regulations of one or other of these colleges, or (d) in any similar insti- 
tution within the precincts of the university as may be recognized 
hereafter by the university by grace of the senate. 
3. Prescribes that certificates of residence shall resemble those sup- 
plied to the men. ‘ 
4, States that either the previous examination or one of the usual 
substitutes must be taken, except as provided under 5. 
5. Female students who have obtained an honor certificate in the 
higher local examination may be admitted to a tripos examination, 
though such certificate does not cover the special portions of the higher 
local examinations which are accepted by the university in lieu of parts 
or the whole of the previous examination, provided that such students 
have passed in Group B (language) and Group C (mathematics). 
6. Provides that all female students must be recommended for admis- 
sion to examination by the authorities of the college. 
7. After each examination a class list of the female students who 
have satisfied the examinations shall be published by the examiners at 
the same time as the class list of members of the university, the stand- 
ard for each class and the method of arrangement in each class being 
the same in the two class lists. 
8. In each class of female students in which the names are arranged 
in order of merit the place which each of such students would have 
occupied in the corresponding class of members of the university shall 
be indicated. 
9, The examiners for a tripos shall be at liberty to state, if the case 
be so, that a female student who has failed to satisfy them has in their 
opinion reached a standard equivalent to that required from members of 
the university for the ordinary B. A. degree. 
10. To each female student who has satisfied the examiners in a tripos 
examination a certificate shall be given by the university, stating the
-P-A-G-E-914
  856 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
conditions under which she was admitted to the examination of the uni- 
versity, the examinations in which she has satisfied the examiners, and 
the class, and place in the class, if indicated, to which she has attained 
in each of such examinations. 
The remaining paragraphs are concerned with technical details. 
In 1884 some additional graces were passed, laying down certain 
rules for the government of women’s colleges and the construction of 
the buildings. They provided (a) that the buildings should be suit- 
able; (b) that each college should have a committee of management of 
not less than 9 members, 3 at least of the members of the senate of the 
University of Cambridge, and that the ordinary place of meeting for 
the committee should be in Cambridge; (c) that the arrangements 
for tuition and discipline should be adequate; (d) that before recogniz- 
ing any new establishment for women the council should ascertain that 
the conditions above named were complied with. 
Arrangements are also made for a temporary recognition of a new 
establishment, to be followed by a permanent recognition in the case 
of adequacy. 
To understand the exact position of women under these regulations 
it is necessary to make clear the position of the male students. On 
matriculation they become members of the university; they are subject 
to university discipline; they have to reside for a certain number of 
terms and a certain number of days in each term; they have to take 
certain examinations, which are different in the case of candidates for 
an ordinary degree and candidates for a degree in honors. 
Women are not members of the university, nor are they subject to 
university discipline. They are members of colleges, which colleges in 
their corporate capacity are acknowledged by the university, and have 
to submit to certain regulations laid down by the university; they have 
to follow the rules for residence laid down for members of the univer- 
sity; they are admitted to the honors examinations of the university, 
but are excluded from the ordinary pass degree examinations; they 
are allowed, if they please, to substitute for the previous examination 
(the first university examination) another examination, the standard 
of which is higher, but which admits the exclusion of Latin and Greek. 
The differences of treatment thus far are slight and, in the eyes of 
many, superfluous, as few women will avail themselves of their right 
to avoid the previous examination; and the absurdity of admitting 
women to the harder degree examinations and excluding them from 
the easier ones is patent to all. The real difference hetween the posi- 
tions of male and female students is the right of the former to use the 
letters of the degree, B. A. and M. A., while the latter receive instead 
a diploma, but are not allowed to claim the degree. This disability 
has been more and more acutely felt as newer universities have opened 
their degrees to women; and in the year 1887 petitions from several 
different quarters were sent up to the senate of the university, pointing 
 
-P-A-G-E-915
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 857 
out the anomaly in the position of women and asking for the confer- 
ment of the degree. This petition contained the following statement: 
Systematic study and discipline are supplied by women’s colleges, and the uni- 
versity has made provision for testing and certifying attainment according to the 
standards in honors adopted for its own members; but under the existing regulations 
women do not become members of the university, and though they may have satis- 
fied every condition which entitles an undergraduate to a degree, the degree itself is 
withheld. 
The memorials were very largely signed by members of the senate, 
old students of the colleges, head mistresses, assistant mistresses, and 
miscellaneous persons whose names would bear weight. 
The opposition took the line (a) that the higher education of women 
should not be permanently tied to that of men; (bd) that if degrees 
were granted to women they should be conferred by some independent . 
authority. \ 
The opposition carried the day and the matter was not even brought 
to a vote. No further attempt has been made since to obtain the 
degree for women. Meantime the remarkable successes of the women 
students and the increase in the number of universities in the United 
Kingdom that confer degrees on women is making the anomaly all the 
more glaring. Yet perhaps the friends of women’s education are doing 
well to wait until the situation becomes so absurd that the university, 
in order to preserve its self-respect, will be forced to make a remedy. 
III. EXAMINATIONS, 
In an English university the part played by examinations is a very 
important one in the conferment of degrees. The work of the class 
room is never taken into consideration. The place of the candidate 
depends entirely on his success in the final examination; and the 
results of these examinations are very widely made known. It is of 
the utmost importance for a man’s future career that he should obtain 
a place in a high class and a high place in that class. 
For the arts degrees of the University of Cambridge two courses of 
study are possible, that for the ordinary degree and that for the degree 
in honors. As the latter one is open to women, it will be sufficient for 
our purpose to confine ourselves to that. 
Most students at Cambridge are members of a college as well as of the 
university, and they have, therefore, on admission, passed the entrance 
examinations of their college. The standards of these examinations 
vary a good deal, and are in no way controlled by the university. Girton 
and Newnham haye each their own entrance examination. 
The first examination that has to be passed after admission is the 
previous examination, commonly known as the “Little-go.” This may 
be taken at any time before a candidate enters for a tripos (honors 
degree) examination, but it is advisable to take it as early as possible. 
It is held three times in the year—in October, December, and June.
-P-A-G-E-916
  858 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Well-prepared students may take it at the beginning of their first term 
(in October), and then have their full three years for their degree work. 
The examination consists of three parts, which may be passed the 
same or at different times. 
The subjects of Part I are (1) one of the Gospels in the original 
Greek; (2) one of the Latin classics; (3) one of the Greek classics; 
(4) unseen Latin translation (with dictionary); (5) questions on Latin 
and Greek grammar, with special reference to the set subjects. 
In the case of students who desire it an additional paper on one of 
the Greek or Latin classics is substituted for the paper on the Greek 
Gospel. 
The subjects of Part II are (1) Paley’s Evidences of Christianity; 
(2) Euclid, Books I, II, III, parts of V and VI; (3) arithmetic; (4) 
5 erence algebra. 
In the case of students who desire it a paper in elementary logic is 
substituted for the paper on Paley’s Evidences. 
Part III (called “additional subjects”) gives the candidate a choice 
among three subjects: (1) Mechanics and trigonometry; (2) French; 
(3) German. 
It is worth noting that these additional subjects are a survival of 
the days when every candidate for honors at Cambridge had to pass 
the mathematical tripos. For this requirement additional mathemat- 
ical papers in the previous examination were substituted, and a few 
years ago further relief for nonmathematical students was provided in 
the permission to substitute a modern language for these mathematical 
papers. 
There are certain examinations which the university accepts as sub- 
stitutes for the previous, provided students have passed in those 
subjects which are required in the above examination. These are (1) 
the Cambridge senior local examination; (2) the Cambridge higher 
local examination; (3) the higher certificate of the Oxford and Cam- 
bridge joint board examination; (4) the examination at affiliated col- 
leges and centers prescribed in the ordinances of the university. 
One or other of these examinations has often been passed at school, 
and it is a convenience to students to proceed at once to their honors 
work without the delay of the previous examination, even though it is 
an extremely easy one. 
Besides these substitutes allowed by the university to its members, 
there is the special exemption granted to women who have obtained 
an honors certificate in the higher local examination, including a pass 
in languages and mathematics. 
The higher local examination was started in 1869 with the object of 
providing some inducement to girls to continue their studies after they 
left school. It became extremely popular, and before university exam- 
inations were opened to women its certificate was coveted by women 
who hoped to obtain good posts in schools. Of late years the improved
-P-A-G-E-917
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 859 
standard of the schools has made it possible for girls in the highest 
class to prepare for the examination, and for the better posts a better 
certificate (e. g., the degree examination of a university) has become 
necessary. The higher local has come to be regarded as a preliminary 
university examination, and as such may be a substitute for the pre- 
vious examination. 
The subjects of examination are arranged in groups. They include 
religious knowledge, English language and literature, languages (Latin, 
Greek, French, German, Italian), in which the candidate chooses one or 
more at pleasure; mathematics, moral science (logic, psychology, polit- 
ical economy), natural science, music, history. Jor an honors certifi- 
cate, a candidate must satisfy the examiners in elementary arithmetic 
and in three of the eight groups, in two of which a first or second class 
must be obtained. 
The examination is held annually in June, and there is an additional 
examination in languages and mathematics in December. 
So much for the preliminary examinations. Though the standard is 
not very high, and the work required in preparation can hardly be 
regarded as university work, yet, as the previous or one of the substi- 
tutes is compulsory, and no possible exemption can be obtained, even 
by graduates of other universities, it is of importance for intending 
students to be acquainted with the regulations. The real work at the 
women’s colleges is in preparation for the final honors examinations. 
These, for some reason, for which various explanations are offered, are 
at Cambridge called triposes. Tripos examinations are held in the fol- 
lowing subjects: Mathematics, classics, natural science, moral science, 
history, medieval and modern languages, oriental languages, law, 
theology, and miscellaneous sciences. 
Several of the examinations are divided into two parts, both held in 
the Easter term of each year. Certificates of first, second, or third 
honors are granted to students for success in the first part alone, but 
after they proceed to the second part, for which a more special know!- 
edge of one or two branches of the subject is required. The time of 
residence in Cambridge necessary to be kept by any candidate for a 
tripos examination varies from 5 to 13 terms. The first part may be 
taken in either the sixth or ninth term, but a student who took it in the 
sixth term and did not proceed to the second part would not receive a 
degree certificate, though one who took it in the ninth term would 
receive one. This is an important point, as showing the stress laid by 
the university on residence for at least three years. No one (except a 
member of an affiliated college) who has not resided three years at 
Cambridge can obtain a degree or degree certificate. 
No one can present himself for a tripos examination more than once. 
Most students confine themselves to the work for one tripos, but those 
who prefer taking two to specializing in one can divide their time 
between the two. An undivided tripos or the first part of a divided
-P-A-G-E-918
    860 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
tripos must be taken not later than the ninth or tenth term of resi- 
dence, unless another tripos has already been passed, and then the 
time may not be later than the thirteenth. 
The following are the regulations for the various tripos examinations: 
THE MATHEMATICAL TRIPOS. 
This examination consists of two parts. The first part extends over eight days, 
and between the first four days and the second four days there is an interval of 
eleven days. All candidates must have passed in the first four days’ examination 
before they can be admitted to the remainder of the examination; whether they have 
so passed or not is ascertained by the examiners during the eleven days’ interval. 
No candidate for Part I will be admitted earlier than in her fifth, or later than in 
her tenth term of residence. 
Certificates of first, second, or third class honors (wranglers, senior optimes, 
junior optimes) will be granted for success in the eight days’ examination, but only 
a third class will be awarded for success in the first four days’ examination alone. 
Only those candidates who have obtained honors in Part I in a preceding year 
will be admitted to the examination in Part II, and they will not be admitted 
earlier than in their eighth or later than in their thirteenth term of residence. The 
examinations for Part I and Part II are held in May. The examination for the first 
four days of Part I comprises the subjects included in Schedule I, the subjects 1, 2, 
3 to be treated without the use of the infinitesimal calculus or the methods of 
analytical geometry. 
Schedule I.—(1) Pure geometry; namely, Euclid, Books I-VI, Book XI, Props. 
1-21, Book XII, Props. 1 and 2; simple properties of lines and. circles; inversion; 
elementary properties of conic sections treated geometrically. (2) Elementary 
algebra, including the binomial theorem, exponential theorem, logarithms. (3) Ele- 
mentary parts of plane trigonometry so far as to include the solution and proper- 
ties of triangles. (4) Elementary parts of plane analytical geometry. (5) Elemen- 
tary parts of differential and integral calculus. (6) Elementary parts of statics. 
(7) Elementary parts of dynamics. (8) The first, second, and third sections in Book 
Iof Newton’s Principia. (9) Elementary parts of optics. (10) Elementary parts of 
astronomy. (11) Elementary parts of hydrostatics. (12) Elementary parts of heat. 
(18) Elementary parts of electricity. 
The examination for the second four days of Part I comprises the subjects included 
in Schedule IT. 
Schedule II.—(1) Algebra: Theory of equations; (2) trigonometry, plane and 
spherical; (3) analytical geometry, plane and solid, including curvature of curves 
and surfaces; (4) differential and integral calculus, including Fourier’s Theorems 
and caleulus of variations; (5) differential equations, including partial differential 
equations of first order: Functions of Legendre and Bessel; (6) elementary, elliptic 
functions, excluding the theta functions and theory of transformations; (7) statics, 
including bending of rods; attractions; (8) hydrostatics, including capillarity 
and rotating homogeneous liquid ellipsoids; (9) dynamics of a particle; (10) rigid 
dynamics; (11) hydrodynamics; (12) geometrical optics; (13) spherical astronomy; 
(14) electricity and magnetism. 
In Part I there are eight divisions, and any candidate who shows proficiency in 
two divisions is placed in the first class. 
(For particulars as to these divisions see The Student’s Guide to the University, 
Part I (latest edition), Deighton, Bell & Co. 
It may be well to call attention here to the fact that those who have had little or 
no training in mathematics before coming up to Cambridge can scarcely hope to 
obtain a good place in this tripos. The same remark will apply to the classical 
tripos.

THE CLASSICAL TRIPOS. 
‘This examination consists of two parts, both held in the Easter term. No student 
will be admitted to Part II who has not obtained honors in Part I; neither may she 
present herself for both parts of the examination in the same year. 
No candidate for Part I will be admitted earlier than in her fifth term of resi- 
dence or later than in her tenth unless another tripos has already been taken. To 
Part II she may be admitted not earlier than in her eighth nor later than in her thir- 
teenth term. 
Part I.—Papers will be set in the following: (1) Latin prose composition; (2) 
Greek prose composition; (3) Latin verse composition; (4) Greek verse composition; 
(5) Greek history, literature, and antiquities; (6) Roman history, literature, and 
antiquities; (7) Greek grammar and criticism; (8) Latin grammar and criticism. 
Further, five papers will be set containing passages for translation from the best 
Greek and Latin authors, together with questions arising immediately out of such 
Passages. 
Part If.—This second part is intended for those students who wish to show a 
special and technical knowledge of some of the higher branches of classical learn- 
ing. It consists of five sections, A,B, C,D, and E. All candidates must pass in 
Section A, and in one but not more than two of the other sections. 
Section A.—Section A consists of four papers in higher classical scholarship, 
namely, one paper in Greek prose composition, one in Latin prose composition, one 
in translation from Latin into English, and one in translation from Greek into 
English. 
Section B.—Ancient philosophy.— Five papers of three hours each will beset in this 
section. 
A list of selected works of Plato, Aristotle, and other authors will be issued from 
time to time by the classical board, but a general knowledge of ancient philosophy 
will be required. 
Section C.—History.—Five papers of three hours each will be set in this section. 
The papers will contain questions on Greek and Roman history—political, consti- 
tutional, social, and literary—and on Greek and Romanlaw. The chronological limits 
of the papers will be determined from time to time by the classical board. 
Section D.—Archwology.—Five papers of three hours each will be set in this section. 
Questions will be set on (a) the history of art and the lives and works of artists 
in the ancient Greek and Roman world; (b) the mythologies, religious usages, and 
ceremonies of the ancient Greeks and Romans; (¢) some group or class of monu- 
ments, to be from time to time specified; (d) the art and handicraft and the inscrip- 
tions of the ancient Greeks and Romans in relation to their national and domestic 
life. 
Section E.—Language.—In this section there will be four papers of three hours 
each, 
Questions will be set on Greek and Latin etymology; the history of the Greek dia- 
lects andof the Italian dialects cognate to Latin; Greek and Latin syntax, together 
with passages for translation from Greek and Latin authors; the etymology and 
usages of the Greek and Latin languages as compared with one another; simple ques- 
tions on Sanskrit grammar, with special reference to the history of the Greek and 
Latin languages; general questions on the comparative grammar of the Indo-Euro- 
pean languages, with special reference to Greek and Latin, and questions on the 
history of alphabets. : 
(For further particulars see The Student’s Guide, Part III.) 
It is chiefly in verse and prose composition that early training is important for 
this tripos; it is difficult to acquire in a short period by mere concentrated effort 
the grammatical accuracy and the simplicity and elegance of style which are 
demanded, and which more naturally spring from long use and habit.

NATURAL SCIENCES TRIPOS. 
The two parts of this examination are both held in the Easter term of each year, 
and only those who have obtained first, second, or third class honors in Part I or in 
the mathematical tripos may offer themselves for examination in Part II. Candi- 
dates may present themselves for Part I not earlier than in their fifth and not later 
than in their tenth term of residence (unless they have previously obtained honors 
in another tripos). For Part Ii they must present themselves not earlier than in 
their cighth and not later than in their thirteenth term. 
The examination for this tripos is in the following subjects: (1) Chemistry, (2) 
physics, (3) mineralogy, (4) geology, (5) botany, (6) zoology and comparative anat- 
omy, (7) human anatomy, (8) physiology. 
In Part I there is an examination by printed papers lasting three days, and a 
practical examination, conducted either in writing or viva voce, or both. It is 
usual toread four of the eight subjects in which questions are set. Sometimes threo 
are chosen, but it is inadvisable to take less than three or more than four. The ques- 
tions in all the subjects in this part of the examination are of a comparatively ele- 
mentary character, and it is intended that they shall test a knowledge of principles 
rather than of details. In arranging the class list the examiners are guided by the 
aggregate knowledge shown by the candidates, provided that no credit be assigned 
to a candidate in any branch of science unless a competent knowledge of that 
branch of science has been shown. 
In Part II there are four separate papers of three hours each set in each of the 
above-named eight subjects, and there is a practical examination conducted in 
the same manner as that for Part I. It is usual for each candidate to choose two 
subjects for examination, and no candidate can be placed in the first class for pro- 
ficiency in one subject unless a competent knowledge of some other subject be shown 
also.

MORAL SCIENC. 
  S TRIPOS. 
The two parts of this examination are held in May in each year. No candidate 
may present herself for examination in both parts in the same year. 
Candidates for Part I will not be admitted earlier than in their fifth term of resi- 
dence or later than in their thirteenth, unless they have already taken honors in 
some other tripos. 
Candidates for Part II will not be admitted earlier than in their eighth term or 
later than in their thirteenth, and they must previously have obtained honors in 
Part I or in some other tripos. S 
Part I consists of two papers on each of the following subjects, together with a 
paper of essays: (1) Psychology, including ethical psychology, (2) logic and meth- 
odology, (3) political economy. 
Part II consists of papers on (1) ethical and metaphysical philosophy, (2) ethical 
and political philosophy and the following special subjects: (3) History of philoso- 
phy, (4) advanced logic and methodology, (5) advanced psychology and psychophys- 
ics, (6) advanced political economy, one or more of the papers taking the form of 
questions for essays. 
Candidates for Part II must take either (1) or (2), and also one or two but not 
more than two of the four special subjects.. No candidate will obtain a place in the 
class list unless she satisfies the examiner in (1), together with any one of thespecial 
subjects, or in (2), together with (6).

THE HISTORICAL TRIPOS. 
The examination is held toward the end of the Easter term in each year, and is 
not divided into parts. No candidate for this tripos will be admitted earlier than 
in her eighth or later than in her tenth term, unless she has already taken honors in 
another tripos.

departments of the same, provided that they give notice of such limitation two years 
before the time at which examination in the subjects so limited is to take place. 
(For further details see The Student’s Guide, Part V.) 
THE ORIENTAL LANGUAGES TRIPOS. 
The subjects are Hebrew, Aramaic (eastern and western), Arabic, Sanskrit, Persian, 
and the comparative grammars of the Semitic and Indo-European languages. 
The examination in each of these languages is divided into two sections. In the 
first section it is of a more elementary character. 
In the first section two papers are set in each of the languages except Sanskrit. 
In Sanskrit there are three papers. A paper is also set on the comparative grammar 
of the Indo-European languages. For the second section there are four papers in 
Sanskrit and three in each of the other languages. 
No candidate shall be placed in Class I who has not exhibited a competent knowl- 
edge of two languages, or of one language together with elementary sections of two 
other languages, or of either Sanskrit or Persian together with the comparative 
grammar of the Indo-European languages. If both the languages are Semitic, a 
knowledge of the comparative grammar of the Semitic languages will be required. 
THE THEOLOGICAL TRIPOS. 
This examination consists of two parts. The first part extends over four days, the 
second over eight days. Both parts may be taken consecutively in the same year, 
orinseparate years. It is taken not earlier than the eighth nor later than the twelfth 
term of residence, or, supposing another tripos has already been taken, one or two 
years may elapse between this and the examination in theology. 
For Part I the subjects are: (1) Old Testament, a general paper. (2) New Testa- 
ment, a general paper. (3) The book of Genesis, or some other specified portion of 
the historical books of the Old Testament, in Hebrew. (4) Passages for translation 
from the historical books of the Old Testament generally, with questions on Hebrew 
grammar; easy Hebrew composition. (5) The Gospels in Greek, with special refer- 
ence to some selected Gospel. (6) The Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse in Greek, with 
special reference to some selected portion. (7) History of the Church to the death 
of Leo the Great. (8) History of Christian doctrine to the close of the Council of 
Chalcedon. 
For Part II they are: (1) Old Testament; the book of isaiah in Hebrew. (2) 
Selected portions of poetical and prophetical books in Hebrew and the Septuagint, 
including always some portion of the Psalms. (3) Passages of a translation from 
the Old Testament generally; Hebrew composition. 
IT. New Testament.—(1) A selected Gospel, with some patristic commentary and 
the Latin versions. (2) A selected Epistle, with some patristic commentary and the 
Latin versions. (3) New Testament, generally with Greek composition.

erature; Philo ana Josephus. (2) Selected Greek and Latin ecclesiastical writings. 
(3) A historical period between the death of Leo the Great and the taking of Con- 
stantinople, with selected illustrative documents. (4) A historical period between 
the taking of Constantinople and the present time, with selected illustrative docu- 
ments.

(3) History of Christian worship, with special reference to selected ancient liturgies 
and service books, and (0) the history and contents of the Book of Common Prayer. 
(4) An essay on some theological question arising out of the subjects of the section. 
The mechanical sciences tripos deals largely with practical work in mechanics. 
All the triposes have now been taken by women except the mechanical sciences 
and the oriental languages. For the latter one lady is now preparing. 
IV. Metuops, or Stupy. 
One of the results peculiar to the mingled authority of university 
and college is a division of labor in the matter of teaching. There are 
university lectures, intercollegiate lectures, and college lectures, and all 
these may be supplemented by private coaching. Hence it is not easy 
to lay down the exact position of women in regard to the instruction 
they can receive at Cambridge. Generally speaking, however— 
(1) University lectures are free and open to all comers of both sexes. 
These lectures do not play a large part in preparation for the triposes; 
often they do not even deal with the special subjects required. They 
are largely attended by graduates when they deal with advanced work 
on original lines; at other times they may incline to be popular, as was 
often the case with the late Sir John Seeley. They generally represent 
the best university thought on the subject dealt with; but as they are 
by no means sure to “pay” in the tripos, they seldom attract a large 
undergraduate audience. Yet this varies with the subject and with 
the professor, and it is not possible to make any general statement on 
the subject. 
(2) Intercollegiate lectures are given at the various colleges, and 
members of other colleges are admitted to them, usually on payment of 
afee. These lectures are usually in preparation for one or other of the 
examinations. Women obtain admission to a good many of these lee- 
tures, some colleges according the permission freely, others on special 
conditions, and some withholding it altogether. As each college has 
its own internal government, the authority who can give this permis- 
sion is not always the same. Sometimes the lecturer has power to give 
it, at others the tutors of the college have to be consulted. As a rule, 
when permission has once been granted it is not withdrawn, and the 
particular college is regarded as one where women may attend the lec- 
tures. It is important to remember that these colleges are places of 
residence for male students as well as places of instruction, and that 
therefore attendance here is not at all the same thing as the common 
meeting of men and women in some lecture room on neutral ground. 
Some colleges require the lady students to be accompanied by a chape- 
ron, but as a rule it is considered enough to stipulate that one lady 
student should never come alone, but that there should be two or more 
present. 
(3) College lectures are for the members of the college only, and often 
partake of the nature of a private class. Much of the work done at 
Girton and Newnham is of this character. 
ED 95. 28  
-P-A-G-E-924
    866 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
(4) Coaching is generally a matter of private arrangement, but the 
women’s colleges include some ecaching in their inclusive fees, The 
amount required depends on the nature of the study. In classies a 
a certain amount of the work is always done in this way—e. g., prose 
and verse, correction of unseen translation, and generally some time is 
given to the solution of difficulties in the student’s private reading. In 
mathematics coaching plays a large part; indeed, certain coaches who 
succeed in turning out many high wranglers (first class in the mathemat- 
ical tripos) among their pupils become celebrities. 
In natural science and history there is less of this work, and the lec- 
ture room plays a greater part. But here too there is nearly always 
some private correction of papers and general direction of work. 
There is much less lecture-room and recitation work than in America, 
and more independent work by the students themselves. Hence the 
necessity of having some one generally to guide and direct the work. 
Girton supplies all the coaching required by the student for an ineclu- 
sive fee. Newnham generally supplies as much as seems advisable, but 
a student wishing extra coaching pays for it herself. The fee is usually 
10s. 6d. an hour. 
A. Mathematics.—In connection with the special work required for 
the mathematical tripos, Miss Collier, mathematical lecturer at Newn- 
ham, makes the following statements: 
MATHEMATICAL TRIPOS. 
The work for this tripos, as for the classical, is far more than can be covered ina 
three-years course. The moderately well-prepared student, before coming up, has 
usually studied the clements of geometry, algebra, trigonometry, conic sections 
(treated both geometrically and analytically), statics, and dynamics. Such a student 
could not hope to acquire a knowledge of all the many subjects embraced by the 
tripos examination, for in addition to more advanced work in the subjects above 
mentioned these comprise theory of equations, differential and integral calculus, dif- 
ferential equations, spherical trigonometry, astronomy, optics, hydrostatics, heat, 
electricity, Newton’s Principia, Sections I and IT, solid geometry, dynamics of a par- 
ticle, rigid dynamics, and analytical statics. In all these subjects the student is 
expected to show very considerable skill in effecting the solution of problems; much 
time and labor is devoted to the development of her powers in this direction. To 
quote a well-known mathematical coach, ‘‘In Cambridge mathematics is studied as 
an art, and not, as elsewhere, merely as a science.” 
As a rule the students read with a coach, either alone or in small classes of two or 
three. They usually have three lessons a week of an hour each. Occasionally they 
attend courses of lectures given by university professors and lecturers. 
A knowledge of a limited number of these subjects is sufficient to obtain a second 
class. Those who are working for a third class would only attempt to read the fol- 
lowing subjects: Geometry, algebra, trigonometry, conic sections, statics, dynamics, 
astronomy, optics, hydrostatics, Newton’s Principia, heat, electricity, differential 
and integral calculus. 
B. Classies.—With the growth of the colleges the number of women 
reading classics has increased, and the development of the classical 
teaching in girls’ schools has removed in a great measure one of the
-P-A-G-E-925

former difficulties in the way of organization at Cambridge, which con- 
sisted in the great difference in the amount of knowledge possessed by 
those who came up. 
It is now usual to dispense with elementary classes in arranging the 
work for classical students. The nominal course of study now consists 
of a class for Latin reading, a class for Greek reading, individual teach- 
ing in Latin and Greek prose and verse, and in unseen translation from 
both languages, and courses of lectures on history, grammar, and phi- 
lology. A great part of the reading is done by the students alone, and 
they take their difficulties to the lecturer. 
The greater part of the teaching is given by members of the univer- 
sity, several of the best classical lecturers at Cambridge being on the 
staff of the women’s colleges. Each of the colleges has also two resi- 
dent classical lecturers, and one or two other lady lecturers are on the 
staff. In each case these are old students of the college who have dis- 
tinguished themselves in the tripos. Courses of lectures in history and 
grammar are arranged for as they are required, but the teaching pro- 
vided by the university and colleges of Cambridge is usually available 
in these subjects. 
The above applies to the preparation for Part I of the tripos, but 
women often go on to Part IT; indeed, it is really more common among 
women than among men to read for the specialized groups which make 
up Part II. 
Courses of lectures in ancient philosophy, philology, history, and 
archeology are arranged by the university and colleges of Cambridge, 
and these are in mest all cases open to women; what further work is 
required is provided by private coaching. 
0. Natural science.—The following is a statement by Miss Greenwood, 
lecturer at Newnham College: 
WORK IN NATURAL SCIENCES AMONG WOMEN IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 
The work in natural sciences in the University of Cambridge falls readily into two 
main divisions. Teaching in theory is given largely by means of lectures, of which 
there may be audiences ranging in number from ten to more than two hundred, 
while practical work takes the form of demonstrations. Since practical work is 
organized in connection with almost all the courses of lectures (for wo regard it as 
of extreme importance), there are some laboratories in which the classes are very 
large; in this case demonstrators are provided in such numbers that, roughly speak- 
ing, one demonstrator has to direct net more than twenty men. Tho lectures given 
by professors, readers, or lecturers of the university are thrown open to the students 
of Newnham and Girton by individual courtesy; the demonstrations are open in 
some cases, but women are not admitted where there is great pressure for room. 
This pressure is felt most in elementary work and perhaps in biological subjects, for 
the majority of the men who read natural sciences in Cambridge aro taking medical 
degrees, in which of course biological work is involved, while the elementary classes 
are naturally larger than thoso which provide advanced work. 
As an instance of unusually free admission I may quote the study of physics, in 
which by the kindness of Prof. J. J. Thonrson, men and women are received at the 
lectures and in laboratories on equal terms throughout their course. The physio- 
logical courses furnish an example of division in elementary work; thus, Prof.
-P-A-G-E-926
    868 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Michael Foster’s lectures are open to women; his elementary practical classes aro 
closed; while in advanced physiology, where the numbers are fewer, lectures and 
laboratories are open alike. In chemistry, too, no practical teaching is offered to 
women by the university, but they are kindly admitted by Mr. Pattison Muir to the 
advanced laboratory of Gonville and Caius College. 
To meet the need thus created by the numbers of men students we have laborato- 
ries for the use of women, managed and staffed by former students of the women’s 
colleges. The Balfour laboratory (named after Prof. F. M. Balfour and given to 
Newnham College by his sisters) is used by students of Newnham and Girton alike, 
and here all the practical work for the elementary courses in biology, physiology, 
morphology, and botany is done, with revision and advanced work when they are 
needed. Here, too, there are special science classes when the teaching available 
from the university is temporarily inadequate or unsuitable, and here we have some 
students (possibly corresponding to American post-graduates) and demonstrators 
carrying on research. In the same way there is provision for practical chemistry; 
each women’s college has a chemical laboratory, the teachers at each being almost 
entirely women. We feel that the existence of separate chemical laboratories at 
Newnham and Girton is rather accidental than advisable, and that the joint work 
which is done at the Balfour laboratory gains from the fact that the classes are fed by 
students of both colleges and that there are greater numbers from which demonstra- 
tors and the students who wish to carry on research may spring. 
Individual instruction and guidance, though less necessary in the natural sciences 
than in classical and mathematical work, is of course most valuable, and this is 
given largely by the demonstrators of the women’s laboratories, who are often also 
resident lecturers of Newnham or Girton. 
I may add that this arrangement of work, the apparently accidental result of cir- 
cumstances, is, on the whole, satisfactory. I believe that in the first stages of a sub- 
ject, at any rate, women are the best teachers for women, and that a lecturer of one 
of our colleges ought, after association with the students when they are beginning 
their courses, to be the more efficient and sympathetic guide for them throughout. 
But I think, too, that the change of atmosphero and diversity of teaching which are 
gained by the admission of women students to advanced classes taught and organized 
by men are, from our point of view, invaluable. 
There is no need for special comment on the work for the other tri- 
poses. In modern languages there are always university and other 
lectures dealing with the examination subjects, and a certain amount 
of work is done in college in composition in foreign languages, set- 
ting and correcting of papers, lectures, etc. Hitherto the number of 
women taking this tripos has been in excess of the men, and there has 
been no difficulty whatever in providing for the students of Girton and 
Newnham the same teaching in these subjects thatis given to members 
of the university. Students who specialize in a foreign language ought 
to have a good conversational knowledge of that language before com- 
ing up, and it is very advisable to spend one at least of the long vaca- 
tions in the country, learning the language on the spot. 
In history no large amount of preliminary knowledge is expected. 
What is most helpful is a good knowledge of general history and suffi- 
cient acquaintance with Latin and modern languages to enable stu- 
dents to use original sources when required. 
In moral sciences a part of the work is done in Cambridge and part, 
requiring more individual attention, in small classes or private coaching.
-P-A-G-E-927
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 869 
Law, theology, and oriental languages have as yet attracted few 
women, but they can obtain instruction in these subjects if they de- 
sire it. 
VY. GIRTON COLLEGE, 
Girton College was started from the first with a definite aim, which 
has never been left out of sight, viz, to give women a university train- 
ing similar to that given to men, and to obtain for them the degrees of 
the University of Cambridge. The unity of aim is represented in the 
unity of the building. When it was only possible to build a very small 
piece, it was arranged that that piece should form part of a larger 
whole, and thus each successive addition has further developed the idea 
in the architect’s mind, but not introduced any new disturbing elements. 
The college now contains rooms for the mistress, vice-mistress, junior 
bursar, 6 resident lecturers, 105 students, 12 lecture rooms, library, 
reading room, hall, chemical laboratory, and other accommodations. 
The general appearance of the college is very impressive, and con- 
veys an impression of size greater than the reality. This is due to the 
long corridors, on only one side of which are rooms, while on the other 
there are rows of windows, which contribute to the appearance of height 
and light, so characteristic of the whole building. Girton stands in the 
midst of its own grounds, 14 miles from Cambridge and from the col- 
lege tower. The view extends over the flat country for many, many 
miles, The grounds are carefully kept, Miss Welsh, the mistress, being 
an expert in horticulture, and herself directing .the laying out of the 
walks and planting of shrubs. Outdoor life plays a great part at 
Girton. There are teas on the lawn, reading parties under the trees, 
country walks to the Nadingley woods, tennis and hockey; and for the 
less energetic there is the ““ Woodland Walk” for a constitutional, which 
winds among shrubs and flowers all round the college grounds, and just 
a mile in length. 
The buildings are in three stories, known respectively as bottom, mid- 
dle, and top corridor. Every student has two rooms of her own, a 
study and a bedroom, except on the top corridor, where there are seven. 
large rooms with a part curtained off, the result being practically much 
the same. Asa rule there are folding doors connecting the two rooms, 
but each can be approached separately from the outside. The list of 
furniture supplied by the college is as follows: 
Sitting room.—Carpet, curtains or blinds, fender, fire irons and guard, 
coal scuttle and scoop, hearth brush, writing table with drawers, small 
side table, cupboard with lock, easy-chair, two cane chairs. 
Bedroom.—Carpet and curtains, bedstead and bedding, chest of draw- 
ers, dressing table and glass, washing stand and toilet case, bath, pail 
and hot-water can, towel rack, linen basket, cane chair, and curtain 
linen. 
This makes a good nucleus, and many students add a sofa or another 
easy-chair or two, some fancy tables, and, of course, their own pictures
-P-A-G-E-928
  — 870 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
and ornaments. Some very luxurious girls entirely refurnish and deco- 
rate their rooms; on the other hand, those who have to keep down 
expenses can very well manage with what the college supplies. Wild 
flowers, leaves, berries, etc., are easily obtained for decoration, and early 
in the May term all the rooms are gay and fragrant with cowslips and 
hawthorn. Again, the rooms are prettily built, the windows large and 
light, that they may lend themselves easily to beautifying, and it is 
hardly possible to find a study that is not bright and attractive. On 
the bottom corridor are the dining hall, library, reading room, 13 
lecture rooms, and the laboratory, besides a number of sets of stu- 
dents’ rooms. The dining hall has been enlarged of late years and now 
easily accommodates all the students. Here are hung portraits of some 
of the benefactors of the college—the late Lady Stanley of Alderney, 
Miss Emily Davies, and Madame Bodichon. At one end of the room 
is the high table where the mistress and lecturers sit. The students 
sit at four long tables. All dine together at 6.30. Breakfast is on the 
table from 8 to 9, and from 12 to 3 each student goes in and takes her 
meals when she pleases between those hours, helping herself to the 
dishes on the side tables. Dinner is the only formal meal. Tea is 
taken to the students’ rooms in the afternoon; and in the evening a 
bag with a roll and butter and the requisites for making tea, coffee, or 
cocoa is taken to each of the rooms. Every one takes this little repast 
when she pleases. It is usual to carry the bag to a friend’s room and 
have a little sociable meal instead of a solitary one. The hall serves 
other purposes besides that of dining. The Sunday evening services 
are held here, as also the college concerts and the larger meetings of 
the debating society. It is a room of fine proportions and looks 
extremely well at festive gatherings, e. g., the Old Students’ dinner, 
which takes place here once in two years. 
The library is a very beautiful room, with cosy window seats and 
delightful little nooks by the spacious fireplaces. It contains about 
6,000 volumes, not quite as many as might be expected from the gen- 
eral equipment of the college, but it is gradually being improved. 
Among the treasures are complete editions of Tennyson and Ruskin, 
presented by the authors. The college also owns the library of Mrs. 
Mary Somerville, but this is kept in another room and held in very 
special honor. 
The reading reom is also a fine room, with large bay windows and 
cosy window seats. It contains a large assortment of papers and mag- 
azines, some provided by the college and others bought by subscription 
among the students. Here hang some charming drawings by Miss 
Alexander, presented to the college by Mr. Ruskin; and here, too, are 
the students’ notice boards, with a bewildering list of announcements 
concerning college societies, things lost and found, objects for sale, 
offers to share cabs to Cambridge, ete.
-P-A-G-E-929
  UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 871 
The lecture rooms are small, as they are not arranged for large lec- 
tures, but rather for private coaching or small classes. They are, how- 
ever, very pretty and comfortable. 
In a small room on the ground floor the Girton antiquities are kept. 
This is a very interesting collection of old Saxon and Roman pottery, 
glass, ornaments, etc., found in the grounds of the college. Itis assumed 
that the place may once have been used as a burying ground, and it is 
known that the very straight road between Cambridge and Huntington 
on which Girton is situated once formed part of a Roman road, the Via 
Devana. 
Above the library are the mistress’s rooms, which are large and hand- 
some. The college also has a small hospital, used for isolating infectious 
patients, and a gymnasium, which, however, is by no means adequate 
either in size or equipment. Regular gymnastic instruction has of late 
been provided, but outdoor games, walks, bicycling, ete., are far more 
popular with English girls than systematic gymnastics under medical 
or professorial direction. 
The rules to be observed by the students are the following: 
Girton College— daily rowtine.—8 a. m., prayers; 8.15 to 9, breakfast; 12 to 3 p. m., 
luncheon; 6 p. m., dinner. 
The lectures are for the most part given in the afternoon. 
Students are required to enter their names on the marking roll at some time 
between the hours of 8 a. m. and 9a. m., 12 and 3 p.m., and6 and 7 p.m. Every 
student is required to be present at marking and at the lectures belonging to her 
course, except when leave of absence has been granted by tho mistress. 
Students may have tea in their rooms at 4 o’clock, and after dinner up to 9 o’clock. 
Students who require wine may supply themselves either from home or through the 
housekeeper. 
The college gates are open at 7 a. m.; in winter they are closed at 6 p. m.; in 
summer at dusk. Except within these hours students may not be out beyond the 
grounds. Students may accept invitations from families, but are not at liberty to 
accept other invitations or pay visits of any sort to college rooms without special 
permission. They must not be out of the college later than 11 p. m., and must not 
accept evening invitations for more than, on an average, once a week in any one 
term. A student asking for leave of absence must mention the place to which she 
proposes to go. Subject to the above provisions, students are required to be within 
doors at 10 p. m., when the house is closed. 
A covered building is provided for games and gymnastics, and facilities are given 
for out-of-door games. Students have also the use of a reading room and pianos. 
Subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by the mistress, students may invite 
friends to join in games in the college grounds and in the gymnasium, and may 
entertain friends at luncheon or dinner in hall, or at tea in their own rooms, at a 
fixed charge. If guests are invited to remain in the college after tho gates are closed, 
the time must not extend beyond the time for house locking-up. 
In tho foregoing regulations the term “friends” or “ guests” applies to ladies only, 
except in the case of a parent or guardian. A public room is provided in which 
students may seo visitors up to 6 p.m., subject to the approval of the mistress. | 
Students are not expected to receive the same visitor more than once in each term, 
except in the case of ladies or a parent or guardian. ‘ 
Students are required to be in residence on the day that each term begins, except 
when leave of absence has been obtained from the mistress. If leave is applied for   
-P-A-G-E-930
  872 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
on the ground of health, the application must be accompanied by a medical certifi- 
cate. Students are required to inform the mistress before returning to the college 
at the beginning of term of any infectious illness which may have appeared in their 
homes or with which they may otherwise have come in contact during the vacation. 
Students who desire to reside at Cambridge during any part of the vacations must 
obtain the sanction of the mistress, 
Admission to the college is by examination. The following are the 
regulations:    [RANCH EXAMINATION, 
Examinations are held in London in March and June. A fee of £1 is charged. 
Forms of entry may be obtained from the secretary. Application should be made 
for these forms in time to return them, filled up, with the examination fee, not later 
than January 31 for the March examination and April 30 for the June examination. 
The examination is conducted in writing. Every candidate is required to satisfy 
the examiners in— 
Part I, Preliminary.—(1) The principles and practice of arithmetic. (2) English 
grammar and composition, with questions on the construction of sentences and 
meanings of words. (3) Physical and political geography. (4) English history. 
Candidates will be examined in March and June, 1894, upon the period from the 
Restoration to the death of Queen Anne. A general knowledge of the leading facts 
of English history is also required. (5) Scripture history.! (The New Testament.) 
Part II, Optional subjects.—Every candidate is also required to satisfy the cxam- 
iners in two of the following subjects: (1) Latin; easy passages for translation from 
Latin into English, and easy English sentences for translation into Latin, with 
questions on grammar. (2) Greek; an easy passage of Attic Greek for translation 
into English, and easy English sentences for translation into Greek, with questions 
on grammar. (3) French. (4) German. (5) Elementary mathematics, Euclid, 
Books I, II, and algebra up to quadratic equations, inclusive. 
A certificate of having passed one of the following examinations is accepted in 
place of the entrance examination as qualifying for admission: 
(1) The matriculation examination of the University of London. 
(2) The Cambridge higher local examination, provided that Group B is included. 
(3) The examination for higher certificates of the Oxford and Cambridge schools 
examination board. 
(4 and 5) The Cambridge or the Oxford local examination for senior students, pro- 
vided that a language is included. 
(6) Three sections, including A and B, or Section A and two languages in Section 
B of the Durham local examination for senior students. 
(7) The preliminary examination of the Victoria University. 
(8) The Edinburgh senior local examination, provided thatthe department of lan- 
guages is included. 
(9) The Glasgow senior local examination, provided that one of the optional sub- 
jects selected is taken from Department F’, 
(10) The Aberdeen senior local examination, provided that Department A is taken. 
(11) The St. Andrews senior local examination, provided that two languages other 
than English, or mathematics and one language other than English, are included. 
(12) The leaving certificates examinations of the Scotch education department, 
provided that the candidate passes at one examination in four of the following sub- 
jects: (1) Elementary mathematics; (2) English, and (3 and 4) any two of the 
following languages: Latin, Greek, French, German. 
(13) The matriculation examination of the Royal University of Ireland. 
1In case of objection, this subject is not required; but notice must be given before- 
hand if the paper is not to be taken.
-P-A-G-E-931
  
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 873 
(14) The senior grade of the Irish intermediate examination if the candidate has 
passed in five of the subjects 1-10, provided that mathematics, English, and one other 
language are included. <A candidate who has passed in arithmetic in the middle 
grade may substitute somo other subject for mathematics. 
(15) The Sydney senior local examination, provided that Sections I, III, IV, IX, 
one of the sections in Group II, and one, in addition to arithmetic, in Group II or 
III are taken. 
(16) The entrance examination of the University of Calcutta. 
(17) The matriculation examination of the University of Bombay. 
From the long list of substitutes allowed, it is evident that which 
the college desires is some security that candidates are equal to the 
work rather than the certificate of one particular examination. Inone 
or two cases American students have been admitted without examina- 
tion on supplying satisfactory references from their own college. 
The college course occupies three years, half of each year being spent 
in residence. The charge for board, lodging, and instruction is £35 
($175) per term, paid in advance. This sum covers the whole of the 
university and college charges. It includes lectures, coaching, exami- 
nation fees, cabs to lectures in Cambridge and to examinations, the 
subscription to the Cambridge University Musical Society, and cabs to 
and from the practices. It is important to remember that this is an 
inclusive fee, and that any charge incurred for a student in connection 
with laboratories or lectures in Cambridge is covered by the college. 
There is even a little set of rooms hired by the college in Cambridge 
for the use of its students, including reading room, dining room, and 
waiting room. Students have free access to this; and those whose 
work keeps them in town till the afternoon have lunch provided free of 
charge. The student pays nothing herself except laundry, books, sub- 
scriptions (which are optional), and her private hospitalities. An eco- 
nomical student can easily do all this for £5 ($25) a term, though she 
can, if she pleases, spend much more on it. 
Students who desire to continue their studies at Cambridge during 
the long vacation may reside at the college during July and August 
at a charge varying in accordance with the number of weeks for which 
they may wish to stay. It is not, however, necessary to reside; some- 
times students work with their tutors by correspondence during this 
time. At others they retire to some country place for a course of pri- 
vate reading. So much of the Cambridge work is done by the student 
independently that a couple of months’ work without lectures is often 
very helpful. 
A long list of scholarships is offered by the college, and these are 
eagerly contended for. 
SCHOLARSHIP EXAMINATIONS. 
Candidates for scholarships must have passed an examination qualifying for admis- 
sion to the college, such examination including Latin and elementary mathematics. 
If not previously qualified, candidates may take the required subjects at the time of 
competing for scholarships. 
ED 95——28*
-P-A-G-E-932
  874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Scholarships and exhibitions will be awarded for proficiency in any one of the 
following groups, credit being given for knowledge of some one subject taken from 
another group. 
I. Classics.—Latin, Greek. 
IT, Mathematics.—Euclid, Books I-IV, VI, and XI, Props. 1-21, and geometrical 
conics, algebra and trigonometry, elementary mechanics, and analytical conics. 
IIT, Natural science.—Chemistry ; physics, viz, heat, mechanics, light, electricity, 
and magnetism; botany. 
Every candidate for a scholarship in this group must take chemistry, heat, and 
mechanics, and may take in addition one of the three remaining subjects. 
Tho examination will include practical work in chemistry, physics, and botany. 
IV. Modern languages.—French, German, Italian. 
Every candidate for a scholarship in this group must take French and German, and 
may take in addition Italian. 
Scholarships and exhibitions to be awarded on ihe scholarship examinations.—The Sir 
Francis Goldsmid Foundation Scholarship, of the annual value of £45. 
Twoscholarships of the annual value of £60 and £40, respectively, and other schol- 
arships offered by the college. 
The Clothworkers’ Exhibition, of the annual value of £60, offered to candidates 
whose means are inadequate to cover the whole cost of their college education, pref- 
erence being given to those engaged in or preparing for the profession of teaching. 
The tenure of the scholarships and exhibitions is for three years, beginning in 
October, 1895, with, in the case of the Clothworkers’ Exhibition, one additional term. 
Power is reserved to withhold any of the scholarships offered by the college, or to 
substitute for them other scholarships of less value, if candidates of sufficient merit 
do not present themselves. 
Gilchrist scholarship.—A scholarship of £50 a year for three years, given by the 
Gilchrist trustees, for women desirous of studying at either Girton or Newnham Col- 
lege in preparation for one of the tripos examinations, will be awarded, provided 
that a satisfactory degree of proficiency is shown, on the results of the Cambridge 
higher local examinations, 1895, in one or other of the following groups: 
B. Two languages, of which either Latin or Greek shall be one. 
C. Mathematics. 
E. Physical and natural science. 
Candidates must cither havo obtained an honor certificate in the Cambridge senior 
local examination, or a higher certificate of the Oxford and Cambridge schools exam- 
ination board, with distinction in at least one subject, or at the time of the award be 
entitled to a certificate in the Cambridge higher local examination, or have satisfied 
the examiners in arithmetic and obtained a first or second class in two groups of that 
examination. 
Oxford and Cambridge schools examination.—Two scholarships, each of the value of 
£30 a year for three years, will be offered on the examination for higher certificates, 
to be held in July, 1895, preference being given to candidates showing proficiency in 
classics, mathematics, ornatural science. The successful candidates will be required 
to commence residence in October, 1895, or later, as the college may determine. The 
scholarships will not be awarded unless a sufiicient degree of proficiency is shown. 
Cambridge senior local examination.—Two scholarships, each of the value of £30 a 
year for three years, will be offered to the best candidates among the senior girls in 
the examination to be held in December, 1894. The successful candidates will be 
required to commence residence in October, 1895, or later, as the college may deter- 
mine. 
Any of the above scholarships may be augmented in the case of a student requir- 
ing further assistance. Only one scholarship can be held by the same student. A 
student who has already obtained a scholarship awarded by the college will not 
receive the offer of a scholarship on any subsequent examination, unless it should be
-P-A-G-E-933
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 875 
one of superior value. The scholars will be required to read for a degree certificate 
in honors. 
Scholars not only énjoy the emoluments of their scholarships but 
they also receive thereby a good deal of prestige. In the college hall 
the scholars precede the other students. The senior student.of the 
college is that student of the fourth year who entered with the most 
important scholarship. 
Girton College does not allow any out-students, nor does it as a rule 
admit women who do not wish to read for the ordinary university 
course. There are a few exceptions to this rule, and every such case 
will be considered on its own merits. Graduates of American col- 
leges who do not wish to enter for a tripos will probably be allowed 
to reside for a year or two, choosing their own lectures with the advice 
of one of the resident lecturers. Girton students are not allowed to 
avail themselves of the privilege offered by the university of taking 
the higher local examination instead of the previous. In every 
respect they conform with the regulations laid down for members of ~ 
the university in regard to residence and examinations; and this has 
been done ever since the college started at Hitchin. As the first stu- 
dents received no acknowledgment from the university, the college 
instituted a certificate called a degree certificate, to be conferred upon 
any student whose proficiency has been certified to the satisfaction of 
the college, according to the standard of any examinations qualifying 
for the B. A. degree of the University of Cambridge, providing that 
such student has fulfilled, so far as in the judgment of the college was 
practicable, ali the conditions imposed for the time being by the univer- 
sity on candidates for degrees. This certificate is of less importance 
now that the university confers one; still the college continues to give 
it, and in fact the certificated students have certain rights and privi- 
leges, the chief being that of electing three representatives on the 
Girton College committee. 
The mistress of Girton is Miss Welsh, one of the early students of 
Hitchin days. Until this Easter Miss Florence Ward acted as vice- 
mistress and librarian. The honorary secretary is Miss Emily Davies, 
to whose energy and enthusiasm the college really owes its existence. 
The honorary secretary, secretary, and assistant secretary reside in 
London. 
The lecturers resident in college are: Classics, Miss Jex-Blake and 
Miss Daniel; mathematics, Miss Meyer; moral science, Miss Constance 
Jones; medizvval and modern languages, Miss Hensley; history, Miss 
McArthur. 
Much instruction is also given in the colleges by members of the 
university, and the students attend courses of professorial and inter- 
collegiate lectures in Cambridge. As the distance is rather great, the 
college provides cabs, known as “lecture flies,” between 9 and 1 in the 
morning. These are frequent objects on the Huntington road, which
-P-A-G-E-934
  876 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
leads out to Girton. Lectures at Girton are often given in the after- 
noon, and the students then enjoy the luxury of a long morning for 
quiet study. The number of lectures attended is far fewer than at 
American colleges, and the amount of independent work done greater. 
Five or six hours of private work given to the field covered by a single 
lecture would not be considered at all; in some subjects this would 
certainly be below the average. Hence, except the obligation to attend 
all the lectures belonging to a course, a student is very free to arrange 
her own working time as she pleases, conforming, of course, to the 
regulations renewed from time to time by the students themselves, 
that at certain hours there shall be as little noise as possible in the 
college. 
Social life at Girton is very fully developed. Many girls come there 
straight from school, and now for the first time have an opportunity of 
exercising hospitality, playing the hostess to their friends in college 
and in Cambridge. The Girton students receive a good deal of hos- 
pitality from families resident in Cambridge, and this is usually repaid 
on the occasion of college concerts, tennis matches, etc., when little 
private teas are given by the students to their own lady friends either 
before or after the festivity. For college parties Sunday afternoon is 
a favorite time, and little coffee parties are given after dinner, and some- 
times teas at about 9 or 9.30, when the greater number stop work for 
the day. Then there are all the college societies, bewildering to the 
uninitiated. These are not secret societies, but associations for some 
definite object—some for work, some for play. In the first rank come 
the mathematics, classical, natural science, modern languages, and his- 
tory clubs, at the meetings of which original papers are read and dis- 
eussed. The lawn tennis, cricket, and hockey clubs are very important, 
for those games are very popular at Girton, and arrangements have to 
be made for tournaments, matches with Newnham, with Oxford, etc. 
There is a musical society, which gencrally arranges about two con- 
certs a year. There isa debating society, which generally holds two 
debates a term, and once a year meets the Newnham society for the 
intercollegiate debate, and a junior debating society, for purposes of 
practice. The fire brigade is a very important institution, the impres- 
sion prevailing that it may some day save the existence of the college. 
The pumps, however, are so small that not very much service could 
be done by them; however, the ladder practices and the competition 
in descending from a window by a self-made knot might prove useful in 
ease of an emergency, which is, however, very unlikely to arise. The col- 
lege has 2 gymnasium, but the equipment is very incomplete. A gym- 
nastic instructor has lately been appointed. A bicycle club has been 
lately started. Here, as elsewhere in England, far more stress is laid 
on the exercise spontaneously taken in connection with walking, riding, 
outdoor games, etc., than on systematic gymnastic exercises under 
medical supervision. On the whole, English college girls are a healthy 
race, and their physique often improves a great deal during residence.
-P-A-G-E-935
  UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 877 
The college supports a magazine, the Girton Review, which appears 
once a term and reports all the chief events. It is very interesting to 
old students, though it does not contain much matter of general interest. 
As regards the religious tendency of the college, it may be called 
undenominational. Prayers are read every morning by the mistress, 
and a religious service of the Church of England is held in the hall on 
Sunday evenings, but attendance is not in either case compulsory, and 
no question is ever asked by any of the authorities as to the place of 
worship attended by a student. The church of Girton village is not 
far off, and it is easy to attend one of the Cambridge churches or col- 
lege chapels; but these matters are left entirely to the individual. 
Like the other women’s colleges, Girton contributes to the Women’s 
University Settlement at Southwark. All subscribers have a right 
to be represented on the committee, and one of the members is elected 
by present students, another by past students. Working parties are 
sometimes arranged at Girton to make garments, which are sold very 
cheaply to the poor people in the neighborhood of the settlement. 
VI. NEWNHAM COLLEGE. 
Newnham College was incorporated in 1880 as the union of two asso- 
ciations. In October, 1871, Miss A. J. Clough took charge of a house 
in Cambridge for the benefit of students at a distance who wished to 
attend the association’s lectures. As the number of students steadily 
increased, a hall was specially built for the purpose and put under the 
charge of Miss Clough. In 1879 a second hall was erected, under the 
name of North Hall, and the original one received the name of South 
Hall. A third hall—Clough Hall—was opened in 1880, and the others 
were then rechristened, respectively, Old Hall and Sidgwick Hall. 
In 1893 a new building, called the Pfeiffer Building, was added to 
the old hall. An archway was made as an approach to the grounds, 
around which all the buildings are grouped, and connection thus estab- 
lished between all the different parts of the building. The college now 
stands on a site of about $$ acres; it consists of three halls, connected 
by covered corridors, and it contains accommodations for the principal 
and vice-principals, with resident lecturers, and about 150 students. 
The principal is Mrs. Henry Sidgwick; the vice-principals are Miss 
Helen Gladstone, Miss Jane Lee, and Miss Katherine Stephen. Each 
hall is under charge of one of the vice-principals, and in each is a 
dining hall, reading room, and other rooms for the common use of the 
students. The college hall is used as the dining hall of Clough Hall, 
and is large enough for the whole college to dine together at times. 
There is a small hospital, which can be isolated in case of infectious 
illness. 
Each student has oné room of her own. These vary in size a good 
deal. For some specially large ones or for sets of two extra fees are 
charged. The necessary furniture is provided by the college. There
-P-A-G-E-936
  878 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
is always a low couch, which can be turned into a sofa during the day. 
A very little curtaining turns one of these rooms into a pretty parlor. 
There is always an open fireplace and every room has a kettle. Fire 
and kettle play an important part in connection with the little hospi- 
talities shown by students to their friends. 
The ordinary fees are 25 guineas ($130) a term. There are three 
terms in the year, from eight to nine weeks in length, the same resi- 
dence being required as for members of the university. These fees 
include all charges for board, lodging, and the teaching required in prep- 
aration for the honor examinations. They do not include the laboratory 
fee, which is £1 1s., nor the fees for the university examinations. These 
are: On admission (1) to any undivided tripos, or (2) to the first part 
of any divided tripos, £5 ($25); on admission to the second part of any 
divided tripos, £2 ($10). After having passed any tripos examination, 
an admission to a second tripos, £2. The fee for each part of the pre- 
vious examination is £1. 
The complete course of study at Newnham College involves three 
years’ residence and preparation for a tripos examination. 
Students are not admitted under the age of 18 except in special 
cases. They are required to give satisfactory references, and no 
student is permitted to come into residence without the approval of 
the principal. 
Before admission an intending student must either pass the Newn- 
ham College entrance examination or an examination which is allowed 
as a substitute. These are the Cambridge higher local, Cambridge 
senior local, Oxford and Cambridge schools examination board (these 
are under special conditions), or the examinations for affiliation to the 
University of Cambridge. 
The requirements are so chosen as to insure that a student will be 
able to pass the previous examination or one of the substitutes very 
soon after entrance. 
There are some special cases in which students are admitted without 
examination. 
(a) A candidate obtaining a scholarship is exempt from further 
entrance examination. 
(>) In certain cases foreigners are exempt, provided they can show 
by certificates and recommendations from persons in authority that 
their knowledge is up to the requirements of the college. As the 
entrance examination is held in March, the college would not expect 
a student from a distance to present herself then if she did not enter 
till October. Each case would be considered separately, but it is safe 
to say that a graduate of one of the colleges recognized by the Asso- 
ciation of Collegiate Alumn would have little difficulty in obtaining 
admittance. 
The following are the requirements for the entrance examination, 
which is held annually in March. There are four parts: (1) Arith- 
metic, Euclid, algebra; (2) French and German; (3) Latin; (4) Greek.
-P-A-G-E-937
  UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 879 
Candidates are required to pass in part 1, and in one at least of parts 
2, 3, and 4. 
In (1) there are 3 papers of two hours each. 
In (2) there are 2 papers of two hours each, 1 in each language. 
In (3) there is 1 paper of two hours. 
In (4) there is 1 paper of two hours. 
In 2, 3, and 4 passages are set for translation from the books set each 
year for the previous examination. 
The college admits some women as out-students. These must be 
(a) women living with their parents or guardians in Cambridge, or (0) 
women not generally resident in Cambridge, who are bona fide students, 
and either over 30 years of age or unable to afford the cost of residence 
and accustomed to support themselves. Special cases are specially 
considered. These students are bound to reside in lodgings approved 
by the principal, and to conform to such rules as may be laid down for 
their guidance. 
The regulations are as follows: 
(a) The ordinary fee for out-students is £9 ($45) aterm. The fees 
are payable in advance. Out-students who are not working for Cam- 
bridge examinations pay a tutorial fee of £1 per term to the college, 
and pay their lecture fees separately. 
(b) Each out-student is assigned to one of the halls. 
(c) An out-student has the right to read in the library, and to dine in 
her hall once a week during the term time. 
(d) Permission to reside as out-students will notin general be granted 
to holders of £50 scholarships, and permission will require to be 
renewed every year. 
(e) Application for admission as out-students must be sent in not 
later than September 1. A good many scholarships are offered by the 
college, and these are of immense value to able students who could 
not themselves defray the expenses of their education. The following 
is the list and the conditions under which they are given: 
SCHOLARSHIPS AND EXHIBITIONS. 
The council of Newnham College offer the following scholarships for competition 
in the years 1894 and 1895: 
(a) One of £50 a year, for three or for two years, founded by the late Mr. Stephen 
Winkworth. 
(b) One of £50 a year, for two years, given by Professor Sidgwick. 
(c) One of £50 a year, for three years, given by the Clothworkers’ Company, to be 
held by a student whose means are inadequate to defray the cost of residence at 
Newnham College. 
(d) One of £50 a year, for two years, given by the Drapers’ Company, to be held 
by a student who is preparing for the profession of teaching. 
(e) One of £50 a year, for two years, called the Cobden Scholarship, given by Mrs. 
Stephen Winkworth. 
(f) The Mary Stevenson Scholarship of £35 for one year. 
(g) One or more of £35 for one year.
-P-A-G-E-938
  880 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95, hast 
The above scholarships will be awarded as follows: 
At the classical scholarship examination to be held at Newnham College in March, 
1895, one scholarship of £50 a year, for three or two years, will be awarded to the 
best candidate, provided that such candidate attains a standard ‘satisfactory to 
the examiners. 
At the Cambridge higher local examination in June, 1895, three scholarships of 
£50 a year, for two or three years, will be awarded either (1) for distinguished suc- 
cess in Group C; or (2) for success in two of the Groups A, B, C, D, E, H, provided 
that ono of the two be B or C; or (3) for distinguished success in Group E. 
Candidates for the scholarships to be awarded for success in Group E must pass in 
ono or both of papers 2 and 3 (chemistry and physics). If they do not take 2, they 
must pass in elementary chemistry in paper 1 (the elementary paper), and if they do 
not take 3 they must pass in elementary physics in paper 1. They must take the 
laboratory examination at Cambridge in connection with any of the papers 8 to 7 
which they wish to count toward the scholarship. 
The Cobden Scholarship (¢) will be awarded either (1) for distinguished success in 
Group D, including distinction in political economy, or (2) for distinguished success 
in Group H, together with distinction in political economy. 
One or more smaller scholarships of £35 (gy) may be awarded to candidates who 
have failed to obtain one of the larger scholarships in June, and one of theso scholar- 
ships of £35 may be awarded for distinguished success in the Cambridge higher 
local examination in December. 
The Mary Stevenson Scholarship (f) will be awarded for distinguished success in 
the Cambridge senior local examination held in December, 1894. 
Candidates for entrance will be eligible for the scholarships offered in the higher 
local examination if they have either (a) passed in two groups of the higher local 
examination, one of these being B or C, and in arithmetic; or (b) gained honors in 
the senior local examination and passed in either Group B or Group C of the higher 
local examination. Candidates who have already resided as students for two or 
more terms will be eligible if they have fulfilled the conditions as to examinations 
required by the University before admission to a tripos examination. 
In all the above examinations, if no candidates of sufficient merit present them- 
selves, the scholarships may be diminished in value or withheld. 
Generally speaking, scholarships tenable for three years will not be awarded to 
students who have resided for two or more terms at Newnham College, and scholar- 
ships tenable for two years will not be awarded to students who have resided for 
five or more terms at Newnham College. Scholarships will, however, be continued 
to students for a second, or for a second and a third year, if their circumstances 
make it important to them, provided that they are doing sufficiently advanced work 
and are making satisfactory progress. 
Scholars are required to reside during the tenure of their scholarships; those 
elected before entrance are expected to begin residence in the October following 
their election, unless they have not then attained the ago of 18, or unless they have 
obtained special permission to defer it for a year. A scholarship will only be 
awarded if the council is satisfied that the candidate’s state of health is not such as 
to prevent her from profiting by a systematic course of study at Cambridge. 
The Goldsmiths’ Scholarship.—The Goldsmiths’ Company offer for success in the 
Cambridge higher local examination to be held in June, 1895, a scholarship of £50 a 
year, tenablo for three years at Newnham College, to a candidate whose means are 
inadequate to defray the cost of residence at the college. Candidates must send 
their names, together with a statement of circumstances, to Dr. Keynes, Syndicate 
Buildings, Cambridge. 
No two of the above scholarships can be held at one time by the same person. Nor 
can any one be held with the Gilchrist or the Arthur Hugh Clough Scholarship. 
Any candidate for a scholarship awarded by the council, signifying her wish not to 
receive the emoluments of the same, will, if successful, have the title and status of 
 
-P-A-G-E-939
  UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 881 
a scholar without the emoluments;.and any scholar signifying her wish not to 
receive the emoluments of her scholarship shall retain the title and status of a 
scholar. ‘ 
Candidates for the scholarships awarded by the council in the local examinations 
are requested to give their names and addresses to the local secretary of their center 
during tho week of the examination. 
The council awarded some scholarships otherwise than by the above examinations 
to students who have begun residence and whose circumstances make it important 
tothem. Information about all scholarships will be given by Miss Gladstone, Newn- 
ham College. 
Arthur Hugh Clough Scholarship.—This scholarship has been founded by Mrs. 
Arthur Hugh Clough in memory of her husband. The scholarship, which is of the 
value of £40 a year, will be awarded annually to the best qualified candidate who 
has resided at Newnham College for three years and wishes to continue her studies 
there for a fourth year. 
Exhibitions.—A certain number of exhibitions of five guineas a term are awarded 
to students resident in the college needing assistance, regard being had to intel- 
lectual qualifications, and a written statement of circumstances being required. 
The tripos fees of these exhibitioners may be paid by the college on the recommen- 
dation of the vice-principals. Exhibitions are tenablo with scholarships. 
Loan Fund.—There is a loan fund at the disposal of the college from which stu- 
dents of limited means may obtain help toward the payments of their fees. They 
will be expected to give adequate testimony respecting their intellectual qualifica- 
tions and to make a statement of their circumstances. 
Besides these mentioned above there are: 
(1) A scholarship offered annually at the higher local for success 
in languages, mathematics, or science, to be held at either Girton or 
Newnham. 
(2) A scholarship in memory of Professor Harkness, awarded trien- 
nially to a student of Girton or Newnham on the result of an examina- 
tion in geology or paleontology. 
(3) Two studentships to enable women who have distinguished them- 
selves in the tripos to continue their studies. 
The following are the house rules for students: 
Students are expected to consult the vice-principal before accepting invitations 
from friends, and also if they wish to make excursions in the neighborhood. 
Students are expected to inform the vice-principal what place of worship they 
choose for regular attendance. 
Students are expected to be at home, during the Michaelmas and Lent terms, at 
6.30 p. m.; during the Easter term, at 8.30 p. m.; on Sundays, throughout the year, 
at 8.30 p. m. 
Rules concerning‘domestic arrangements of the household are left entirely to the 
discretion of the vice- principals. 
The arrangements in all the halls are very similar. These are the 
regulations for Sidgwick Hall. The “study hours” are those most 
convenient for work and during which most of the students are likely 
to be engaged in their studies; but no rules are laid down as to hours 
of work, exercise, etc. Every student uses her own discretion and 
works much or little, as she pleases; but if she were in danger of seri- 
ous overwork the vice-principal would probably warn her against it, 
while on the other hand a very idle student might be requested to leave 
the college.

No provisions can be supplied from the kitchen to students for teas in their rooms, 
except milk and butter. Notice must be given beforehand to the housekeeper when 
theso will be required, and she will keep an account of the amount supplied, for 
students to pay at the end of cach term. 
Instruction is given partly by lectures delivered at Newnham Col- 
lege, partly by such lectures of the university and of the colleges as 
are open to students of the women’s colleges. 
The staff lecturers at Newnham are Miss A. B. Collier, Miss M. I. 
Rickett, and Miss P. G. Fawcett, mathematics; Miss E. M. Sharpley 
and Miss I’. M. Stawell, classics; Miss M. Greenwood, Miss I. Freund, 
Miss E. R. Saunders, and Miss L. Sheldon, natural science; Miss A. 
Gardner, history; Miss J. Lee and Miss M. J. Tuke, modern languages. 
Besides these, a number of members of the university lecture at 
Newnham, and the number of university and college lectures open to 
the students is very large. 
Certain of the lectures of Newnham College, of which a list is pub- 
lished at the beginning of each term, are open to women, other than 
students of the college, who have attained the age of 17. Permission 
to attend them is required, and application for this should -be made to 
Miss M. G. Kennedy (secretary). This permission, when once obtained, 
is valid for all subsequent courses of lectures, unless withdrawn by a 
special order of the council. The fee for the term, for each course, is 
from 1 to 2. guineas, according to the number of lectures delivered in a 
week. The first lecture of a course may be attended free of charge. 
The lists of lectures and tickets of admission are to be obtained from 
Messrs. Macmillan & Bowes, 1 Trinity street. Permission may similarly

b¥Full particulars of this course may be obtained from Messrs. Macmillan & Bowes, or from Miss 
Gladstone. 
eStudents attending this class should provide themselves with Random Exercises (Macmillan & 
Bowes) and Miss Austen’s Persuasion. 
d@ Women who are not students of Newnham College can only be admitted to the laboratory if there 
is room; they should apply immediately. 
/ Small classes in mathematics will be formed. Women (who are not students of 
Newnham College) who wish to join them are desired to communicate with Miss 
Gladstone, Newnham College, as soon as possible. 
Students preparing for logic and psychology in Group D should communicate at 
once with Miss Gladstone; students preparing for Group F are advised to attend Dr. 
Garrett’s lectures on harmony. (See University Reporter.) 
The lectures will begin, generally speaking, on Tuesday, January 15. It may be 
found necessary in some cases to alter the days and hours of lectures. If so, it will, 
if possible, be arranged at the first lecture of the course to be altered; any requests 
for alteration should be made at the first lecture.
-P-A-G-E-942
  884 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Tickets of admission to these lectures (which should be given to the lecturer at 
the second lecture) are to be obtained from Macmillan & Bowes, 1 Trinity street, 
by any person who has attended these lectures in any past term or has obtained 
permission to attend them for the future. For this permission application should be 
made to Miss M. G. Kennedy, Selwyn Gardens. This permission when once obtained 
is valid for all subsequent courses of lectures unless it be withdrawn by a special 
order of the council. 
For women who are not students of Newnham College the fee for each course of 
lectures delivered once a week is 1 guinea; for those twice a week, 1} guineas, and 
for those three times a week, 2 guineas; and for the course in practical chemistry, 
4 guineas. For students attending both courses of French lectures the fee is 
24 guineas. Information as to fees for mathematical classes may be obtained from 
Miss Gladstone. Any other deviation from the rule will be announced at the first 
lecture, which is free. The fee should be paid before the second lecture, 
Strangers’ tickets, each admitting to any single lecture, may be obtained by any 
person attending the lectures, on payment of 2s. 6d. for one ticket, or of 1 guinea 
for 9 tickets. 
There are in the college 9 lecture and class rooms, and there is a 
chemical laboratory. In the town, close to the university laboratories 
and museums, is the chemical laboratory for biological and physical 
studies, of which the building and the site are a freehold of the college, 
In the grounds is a small observatory, with an equatorially mounted 
telescope. An old student has been appointed to the post of curator. 
The college library is in Old Hall. It contains about 8,000 volumes, 
and is carefully arranged for reference and well supplied with the books 
that are most commonly needed by the students. 
Between the university and the college, it may be said that the 
Newnham students are amply provided with all they need for their 
studies. 
At Newnham, as at Girton, clubs and societies flourish, and the aims 
of these are much the same in both colleges. The debating society 
plays a rather more important part here, and the debates are more dis- 
tinetly regarded as special festivals. Some of the speaking is very 
good, There is also a political society, which, like the local parlia- 
ments so popular in this country, follows in its proceedings the rules of 
the House of Commons. The society meets every Monday, from 7 to 8 
p. m., throughout the October and Lent terms. At the beginning of 
the college year a speaker, deputy speaker, and secretary are elected 
by a general meeting. There are three parties: Liberal, Unionist, and 
Conservative, and there are a few independents. The parties take it 
in turn to be in office, an amicable arrangement which, unfortunately, 
would not suit the original assembly. Their turn of office lasts one 
year. Each party has its leader, and the party in power has its min- 
istry, chosen by the prime minister at the beginning of the year. This 
party introduces bills. Private members may bring forward motions 
between the division on the bill and the introduction of the next. This 
interest in politics seems somewhat peculiar to Newnham, but now that 
the part played by women in public affairs is increasing so rapidly in 
England, it is a most valuable training.
-P-A-G-E-943
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 885 
At Newnham, as at Girton, each tripos has its club, which meets 
two or three times a term. Newnham students also subscribe to the 
Women’s University Settlement, and elect a representative on the 
committee. 
There is a Sunday Society, which meets Sunday afternoons. At each 
meeting a paper is read on some religious or philosophical subject, or 
a biography of some great man is given. Hockey, fives, and tennis 
clubs also flourish. 
Each hall has societies of its own, such as literary, Shakespeare, 
musical societies, ete. 
Owing to its situation nearer to Cambridge, it is easier for Newnham 
students to take part in events of interest in the town; to attend the 
beautiful musical services at King’s College Chapel, concerts, ete., and 
to pay visits in town. Still the center of interest lies in the college 
itself, with its opportunities for work, for social intercourse, outdoor 
life, and formation of life-long friendships. For women as for men 
students, the college comes first, and the university second; yet for 
both the horizon would be seriously narrowed, the stimulus greatly less- 
ened, if they ever were to become separate institutions, instead of part 
of one great whole—the University of Cambridge. 
VII. UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE. 
A. peculiarity of the older English universities is the distinction 
between university and college. The university as a whole may be 
said to be divided into two parts, the college and the university proper. 
Each college is an entirely separate organization, as is the university 
proper, but it has a general oversight of the colleges. The college has 
buildings for residence for students, fellows, and lecturers, and the 
usual arrangement of these buildings is about a square called a quad- 
rangle, or, popularly, “quad.” At Cambridge these quadrangles are 
generally designated as courts, and when there are many each is desig- 
nated by a special name, e. g., at Trinity there is the Fellows’ Court, 
Vergill’s Court, etc. There are 18 colleges for men at Cambridge, and 
each college has its own faculty, regulations, and characteristics. Some 
are renowned for scholarship, others for athletics; some take higher © 
social position than others. Every college has its own chapel, dining’ 
hall, library, combination room (a sort of general meeting room for the 
fellows), and lecture rooms. Each college is like a small university 
inside the greater one, except that—and this is very important—it does 
not examine or grant degrees. College examinations are held generally 
once a year, but these are to test progress, and in no way affect the 
result of the final examinations. In matters of discipline the college 
and university divide the authority. Each college makes regulations 
for its own students, but there are certain general regulations laid 
down by the university which must be observed by all its members. 
There are a certain number of students who are not attached to any
-P-A-G-E-944
  886 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
college, and are known as noncollegiates, but they are under a special 
board of direction and have to observe certain regulations. 
The university is a body for government, for degree giving, and for 
the supplying of a certain number of instructors. The instructors of 
the university are professors and readers; their lectures are usually 
open to the public without fee. The government of the university is 
vested in a chancellor (at present the Duke of Devonshire), a vice- 
chancellor, elected from one of the heads of houses, and a senate, to 
which belong all doctors of divinity and masters of arts, law, and sur- 
gery, who keep their names on the register for a certain number of 
years. 
It is very important to remember in connection with Girton and. 
Newnham that their members are not only students of a woman’s col- 
lege, but also students at Cambridge. They live in the atmosphere 
of a great and ancient university and inherit its traditions. The 
course of work is that laid down by the university, the examina- 
tions are appointed and conducted by the university, but it is the 
individual college that admits them, supervises them, and makes 
arrangement for their residence: Much the same holds good for the 
men’s colleges. 
If is the graduate women to whom the university acts as a step- 
mother. As they have no degree, they have no manner of position in 
the university. Men who proceed to the degree of M. A. and keep 
their names on the books by payment of an annual sum, form part of 
the university senate, and thus share in the government of the univer- 
sity. This is a privilege Cambridge seems unwilling to grant her 
daughters, although women graduates of London, Victoria, Wales, and - 
the Scotch universities are put in the same position as men. Cam- 
bridge will probably be very slow to make the change, but there are 
some concessions that might at once be granted to women. Chief of 
these is free admission to the university library. M. A.’s of the univer- 
sity have a right to read there when they please and to take out books. 
The most distinguished woman graduate can only get books if a man 
is kind enough to procure them for her, and only reads in the library on 
the same conditions as any other lady who has no connection with the 
university. The excuse is made that the library is very insufficiently 
housed and the rooms are not well adapted for students. Even male 
undergraduates are far from welcome, and are much restricted in their 
hours of reading. The rule is that they may use the library between 1 
and 4, a time when they believe every undergraduate who respects 
himself will be engaged in some athletic exercise. There is, however, 
a provision that they may be admitted at other hours on presentation 
of a card which will be given them if armed by a letter from their 
tutor to the librarian. 
For persons who are not members of the university the regulations 
say that they shall be required to fill up a form of application and to
-P-A-G-E-945
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 887 
present it to the syndicate, together with letters from two members of 
the senate certifying from personal knowledge that the applicant is a 
student of some specified subject, and is a fit and proper person to be 
admitted to the library for the said purpose. Applications accompanied 
by such letters of recommendation are considered by the syndicate 
at two successive meetings. Tickets of admission are not granted to 
persons under 21 years of age unless they are reading for a tripos 
examination. 
The only concession allowed a student of Girton or Newnham is that, 
instead of making application under the above rule, she may present to 
the syndicate with her form of application a certificate signed by the 
principal of her college and countersigned by a member of the senate, 
stating that she is a student of such college, is reading for the tripos 
examination, is studying some specified subject, and is a fit and proper 
person to be admitted to the library for the purpose of study. If the 
application is approved a ticket is given, and for this, if for a duration 
of one year, the sum of £11s. must be paid. 
As a matter of fact, any one who wishes to read for a serious purpose 
is sure to be admitted, but the process may be a tedious one. However, 
as every college has its own library, the university library is not really 
much needed by undergraduates, and the books are so arranged that 
it is not a convenient place for writing. It is chiefly used by M. A.’s 
who take books home and persons who wish to study some rare old 
manuscript or book that may not be taken out. It is one of the libra- 
ries to which publishers are bound to send a copy of every book pub- 
lished, and, considering the pressure on the space, this is a somewhat 
doubtful blessing. 
For the museums and laboratories there are special arrangements, 
which are dealt with elsewhere. The great disadvantage of the posi- 
tion of women at Cambridge is that they are too much dependent on 
the kindness and helpfulness of individuals, and though this kind- 
ness and help are seldom wanting, yet, now that the number of women 
students is increasing so much, it would be of the greatest value to 
secure a few more rights, even at the sacrifice of some special privileges. 
VIII.—TnEe RECORD OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS. 
It is now twenty-five years since women began to study at Cam- 
bridge, and it is possible after the lapse of time to draw some general 
conclusion as to the abilities of the female students, and to make some 
predictions as to the future. During these years no fewer than 669 
women took honors in the tripos examinations, and of these 191 took 
mathematics and 165 classics, a sufficient proof that women have by no 
means shirked those studies on which the older universities so specially 
pride themselves. Still more remarkable is the fact that out of this 
number 136 were placed in the first class. This is nearly one-fifth of 
the whole number, and the proportion of second class is also large,
-P-A-G-E-946
  888 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
These statistics are of importance, because they prove, what it was at 
first very difficult to make English people believe, that women are quite 
as capable of severe and continuous study asmen. With the exception 
of law (and here one was second), theology, and oriental languages, 
women have headed the class lists of every tripos. One of the most 
notable successes was that of Miss Traveth, who in the mathematical 
tripos was classed above the senior triangler. Miss Ramsey (now Mrs. 
Butler) headed the classical tripos list. Miss E. P. Hughes, principal 
of the Cambridge training college, headed the moral science list; one 
or two women have obtained first places in natural science. Miss 
Gardner (history lecturer at Newnham) headed the list in history, and 
in modern languages the superior successes of the women are so common 
as to be hardly a subject ofremark, At first there was an impression— 
doubtless a correct one—that it was only specially gifted women who 
pursued these studies, but it is now becoming a very common thing for 
girls of not more than average abilities to proceed to college. Still 
the percentage of failures continues small, and the number of high 
classes so great that last year Newnham stood third of all the Cam- 
bridge colleges in its record of honors. Thus far the field is undoubt- 
~ edly won. 
As to the careers of students when they leave college there is among 
some people a feeling of disappointment. But this is due to the fact 
that professions in Nngland are only slowly being opened to women, 
and that each opening is generally won by the struggle of one or two 
courageous women. This takes time. Among distinguished alumne 
of Cambridge may be mentioned Prof. C. A. Scott, now at Bryn Mawr 
College; Miss Jane Harrison (on whom the University of St. Andrews 
has just conferred the honorary degree LL. D.), a brilliant and learned 
lecturer on Greek archeology and one of our first authorities on the 
mythology of vases; Miss Eugenia Sellers, who has also done good 
work in Greek archeology; Miss Annette Benson (M. D., of London), 
now senior physician to the Kama Hospital at Bombay, and Miss E. M. 
Anderson, Government inspector of workshops and factories. Very 
many hold important posts as head mistresses, assistant mistresses, 
and lecturers. Excellent work has been done both in science and his- 
tory by old students of both colleges; some have taken up philanthropic 
work, and carry into it a knowledge and training that prove invalu- 
able. Some pursue journalism or other literary work; a few have found 
posts at the Greenwich Observatory. Undoubtedly the majority take 
up teaching, and here their influence has brought about a complete 
revolution in the girls’ schools. Many are married and pursuing no 
special occupation; but here, as in every position, the advantages of 
culture are felt. In fact, it may be said that while results hitherto have 
more than justified the hopes of the founders, they may confidently 
look forward to a far more brilliant future when all the still existing 
barriers have fallen.

LODGING AND BOARDING. 
The English lodging system is a plan of living that has been praised, 
by most people that have tried it, for its practical application of com- 
fort and convenience to the needs of a short sojourn. The general 
plan is to rent a parlor and bedroom. The parlor serves as dining 
room also. The rooms are rented at a fixed price, and are cared for 
by the landlady. The food is purchased by the people who occupy the 
rooms, according to their own liking, is cooked by the landlady, and all 
the work of presenting it upon the table and caring for it in the house 
is done by her. One can have an expensive or inexpensive bill of fare, 
and can consult one’s own tastes, which is of course a very important 
particular. If desired, the landlady will make the purchases for the 
people also, according to directions given her, and present the bill at 
the end of each week for the articles which she has purchased. People 
living in lodgings have, of course, a certain independence which is not 
found in other places. They are quite free from social obligations, 
and can choose their own hours and approximate the independence of 
entirely private life. 
The expenses of this way of living vary, of course, with the situation 
and furnishing of the rooms and the tastes of those who employ it. 
In one case two rooms on the third floor of a dwelling house were 
taken. The situation was conveniently central; the parlor overlooked 
a small park and the bedroom adjoined it at the back. The rent was 
£1 5s.a week. The rooms were completely furnished; each had a fire- 
place; the parlor contained a large central table, a bookcase, sideboard, 
comfortable couch, and other convenient articles of furniture. A short 
distance farther away from the central part of the city, and in not 
quite so pleasant a street, a lady had a parlor and bedroom on the 
second floor very comfortably furnished for 18s.a week. This includes, 
of course, attendance, which means the entire care of the rooms, attend- 
ance to the door, the cooking and care of the food, bringing it to the 
room and removing it again. In one case a lady living alone kept care- 
ful record of her expenses. She found that in a fall term all expenses 
except the rent and attendance amounted to 15s. a week; in the winter 
term, 14s. 6d., and in the summer term about the same. This included 
heat and light and laundry, and all living expenses except the rent 
and attendance. Another young lady, who rented unfurnished rooms, 
which she made most charming by her simple and inexpensive methods, 
found that her expenses, including everything, came to 30s.a week. It 
is more than likely that ladies coming from America to Oxford for 
purposes of study will, in the main, choose this method of living. They 
are chiefly women of some maturity, and, as they are quite able to take 
care of themselves, do not so much need the social protection afforded 
by life in a hall. In case such women as these come, they will certainly
-P-A-G-E-948
    890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
find themselves more free to enjoy the social advantages of this delight- 
ful city if they are quite independent. 
It is sometimes possible to obtain boarding in the homes of professors 
or other gentlemen connected with the university. There will be, of 
course, a great deal of pleasure to be derived from the associations that 
will result from such an arrangement as that, and in case a letter of 
introduction or other means of association brings about such a plan as 
this, if is very much to be preferred, especially for younger students. 
It is expected that £2 a week will be the usual price. Boarding can be 
found in other families at a less price, sometimes as low as a guinea a 
week. 
THE CLIMATE. 
The climate of England, and especially of Inglish counties, has been 
very much abused, perhaps more than it deserves. Hawthorne seems 
to have been of this opinion, and it will be remembered that he declared 
quite in favor of the summer weather, and says that in England “the 
really good summer weather is the very kindest and sweetest:that the 
world knows.” 
It seems to be the fashion for the people from the United States to rail 
at the climate in nearly all the European countries. The complaint 
always is that it is relaxing, but as the majority of travelers coming 
to the Old World are from the Northeastern States, where the air has 
a special keenness and invigorating zest, it is not strange that the 
moisture-laden atmosphere in countries whose shores are touched by 
the influence of the Gulf Stream should be found at first debilitating. 
It is said that if Oxford and Cambridge had not been situated exactly 
as they are one would certainly have destroyed the other, but as both 
are in the worst climate to be found in England thereis nochoice. But 
after all, these criticisms certainly are exaggerated. While there seems 
to be a great deal of rainy weather, the amount of rainfall is not more 
than the average. The whole amount for the year is but 26 inches, 
while for the different months it is as follows:

  People live constantly, I believe, in the expectation of rain; but when 
it comes it is more a soft, gentle mist, floating doubtfully downward, 
than any direct or decisive downpour. The real shower perhaps is not 
more frequent than elsewhere. So far as heat and cold are concerned, 
the extremes are very much modified. 
In the gardens of the colleges the grass is green through the winter, 
and is never, I believe, parched by the heat of summer, and the English 
people must be indebted in part at least to the equability of their
-P-A-G-E-949
  UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 891 
climate for the nationul habit of taking long walks for the sake of exer- 
cise. There is scarcely a day in the whole year when it would not be 
perfectly comfortable at noon for the pedestrian, and the long twilight 
of summer adds to the available opportunities for this delighful mode 
of increasing physical vigor. In winter, no further means of supplying 
heat for the household than the fireplace has been found an absolute 
necessity. There is a fireplace in every room, its use is universal, and 
sufficient even in the coldest weather. People who have been accus- 
tomed to the pervading furnace heat or steam heat will find the fire- 
place not entirely adequate, perhaps, but there is no use in railing 
against this beloved institution, and one can easily make the best of it 
by piling on the coals. 
OTHER UNIVERSITIES IN GREAT BRITAIN THAT ADMIT WOMEN. 
London University (which is really only an examining and degree- 
giving body) puts men and women on exactly the same footing; so does 
Victoria University, the headquarters of which are at Manchester, but 
which consists of (1) Owen’s College, Manchester, (2) University Col- 
lege, Liverpool, and (3) Yorkshire College, Leeds. Students must study 
at one of these three colleges; women study with men in almost all 
cases, but there is no facility as yet for women’s medical studies in con- 
nection with Victoria University, though the medical degrees are open 
to them. Durham University has this year opened all its degrees to 
women except the theological. It requires residence, but this need not 
be at Durham, but may be at one of the other affiliated colleges, e. g., 
that at Newcastle-on-Tyne. So much for the English universities. 
Then there is Wales, which only came into existence last year, and con- 
sists of a.federation of the three university colleges of Bangor, Cardiff, 
and Aberystwith. The charter states that men and women shall be on 
an equality in all respects, that every part shall be open to men and 
women alike, and that there muSt be some women on the governing 
body. Last year all the Scotch universities opened their degrees to 
women, and I believe they are in all respects on an equality with men. 
In Ireland, the Royal University of Ireland, which, like London, is only 
an examining body, confers degrees on men and women alike. Trinity 
College, Dublin, excludes them from degrees and examinations and 
from instruction.

INTRODUCTION. 
The interest manifested of late years in the educational development of women 
in various fields of human endeavor has caused the publication of much valuable 
information appertaining to that subject, and it might seem that the subject was 
exhausted. Yet the many inquiries addressed to those engaged in employments open 
to women indicate that there are still phases of this question which have not been 
placed within the reach of individuals seeking for authoritative information. 
Hence the effort is made in this chapter to group together statements emanating 
from foreign and home authorities which may answer such queries to a certain 
extent. The education of women in the United States has been subordinated to the 
development and conditions in foreign countries; the subject from the home stand- 
point has been fully treated in reports of aseoot enone and in addresses before national 
and international councils and federated clubs. 
The statements from foreign countries, and in part for the United States, have 
been compiled from official documents, or from reports and essays which cite freely 
from laws, decrees, etc., promulgated by the different governments. 
In speaking of the so-called woman’s movement, Miss Frances Power Cobbe, the 
author and keen thinker, says: 
“There have been many movements in the world?—some of them recorded in history 
as portentous events, others forgotten within a few years of their occurrence—which 
may cach be compared to a wave on the surtace of the Mediterranean. From the 
insigniticant ripple to the wave-high billow flecked with foam and breaking in cata- 
racts, they have arisen only to subside to their original level, leaving the boundaries 
of land and sea where they have stood for a thousand years. There are other move- 
ments, on the contrary, which resemble the tides of the ocean, wherein each wave 
obeys one uniform impetus, and carries the waters onward and upward along the 
shore. 
“Of all the movements, political, social, and religious, of past ages, there is, I 
think, not one so unmistakably tidelike in its extension and the uniformity of its 
impulse as that which has taken place within living memory among the women of 
almost every race on the globe. Other agitations, reforms, and revolutions have 
pervaded and lifted up classes, tribes, nations, churches. But this movement has

893

894 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
stirred an entire sex, even half the human race. Like the incoming tide also, it 
has rolled in separate waves, and each one has obeyed the same law, and has done 
its part in carrying forward all the rest. The waves of the higher education of 
women all over the world; the waves which lifted women over the sand bars of the 
medical, and (in America) of the legal and clerical professions; the waves which 
seated them on the school boards and boards of guardians of the poor; the wave 
which gave them the English municipal vote; the wave which restored to married 
women a right to their own property—every one of these waves, great and small, 
has been rolled forward by the same advancing tide.” 
The majority of thinking persons now concede that with the progress of human 
events there has naturally come a broadening of woman’s sphere. Hence to suitably 
fill one’s position in whatever sphere of action, to successfully contend with others 
in the struggle for a livelihood which now oftentimes comes upon the woman of the 
family, it is generally conceded that there is necessity for practical rather than the- 
oretical knowledge. The domestic-economic side of life has been the one most 
thoroughly understood by the women of all nations until within a short period; but 
to-day, when equality of mind and business ability of men and women is conceded 
by the broad minded, it remains simply to state facts bearing upon the outcome of 
the different efforts to so develop the woman that whatever sphere she may be 
called upon to occupy, be it wife, mother, bread winner, in humbler positions or in 
the professions, she will learn to make the most of the God-given talents, and while 
stiil exerting a quiet influence in the home or business circle, she will still continue 
to remember that a womanly woman is a desirable factor in the world’s onward 
movements. 
} A word of suggestion to those who enter the arena of a working life is here cited 
from Woman’s Work and Worth, by W.H.Davenport-Adams. He says: 
“Educated women, however, who seek employment must remember that man’s 
bread is earned only by the sweat of his brow; that if they descend into the arena 
they can not hope for saccess unless they dccept the conditions under which the 
athlete necessarily strives. They must be prepared for hard work, for persevering 
work, and not suppose that because they are women the race will be made easier to 
them than tomen. ‘Men will run alongside with them, struggling for thesame prize,’ 
and as men have generally an advantage in the start, they must brace up every 
energy and bring into play every faculty to avoid defeat and insure victory. They 
must have exactness, punctuality, patience, endurance, thoroughness. Superficial 
knowledge will not do; slipshod, hasty, or imperfect work will not do; weariness, 
apathy, or disgust before the battle is half won will not do. Whatever they under- 
take they must go through with it to the end. They must never put forward any 
work of which they can not honestly say, of which they do not in their own heart 
believe, that it is done as well as they can do it, that it is in very truth their ripest 
and best. They must be on their guard against the emotional elements of their 
nature, against the sudden impulse which makes an eager beginning only to come 
to an abrupt pause. This is their special danger, and it is here, if anywhere—no 
doubt through unwise training and the influence of old traditions—that the ‘info- 
riority’ of women lies. Experienced teachers tell us that girls equal, frequently 
excel, boys in quickness of intelligence, but fall below them in power of application. 
But it is just this power of application, this ‘staying power,’ that wins the victory. 
“The primary use of all knowledge, to adopt a saying of St. Bernard’s, is to build 
ourselves up (edificari); its secondary use is to build up others (wdificare). We 
have sufficiently enlarged on the advantages that each one of us derives from the 
adequate culture of one’s faculties, and we have pointed out the beneficial influcace 
that one so cultivated and disciplined is able to exercise on one’s immediate circle. 
But there is yet another and more material use of knowledge, which must neither be 
ignored nor despised, when we treat it as a means of securing a respectable liveli- 
hood, Until within the last few years, of whatever knowledge women might acquire, 
general or special, she could make little profit in this way; almost every vocation

  was closed against her by custom and prejudice. It is surprising that she so long 
consented to this arbitrary injustice; yet perhaps not surprising when we remem- 
ber the ridicule and obloquy accumulated on the few adventurous ladies who first 
ventured to protest against it. They were informed that woman’s true sphere (which 
few women have cver doubted) was home; that they were not to trespass on the 
privileges and rights of men; that their grand functions wero those of the wife and 
the mother, and that contact with the world in ‘a business capacity’ would sully 
and degrade them. It was useless to argue that women might be wives and mothers 
and yet find leisure for much honorable work; that many felt themselves specially 
qualified for special callings; and that for the unmarried, if of gentle birth or refined 
intellect, the existing channels of profitable activity were wholly inadequate. Tho 
storm raised by jealousy, ignorance, and bigotry continued to rage, and though it 
has to some extent spent itself most uselessly, its mutterings at intervals are still 
‘unpleasantly audible.” 
  THE COLLEGE-BRED WOMAN, 
A historical résumé of the conditions attendant upon the education of women in 
the United States would be of inestimable value, but that work has been attempted 
by well-known writers, and quite successfully, too, so that it is sufficient to simply 
present statements from the latest books and essays on this subject, simply prefacing 
such citations by tho latest obtainable statistics of women attending college courses. 
Of the 415 colleges reporting to this office in 1889-90 there were 256 coeducational in 
character (in some or all departments); the number of women students in 1891-92 
was more than 10,000. Of the 158 colleges for women reporting, 141 have been placed 
in a group by themselves, because the admission requirements, standards of instruc- 
tion, and general organization accord with those that have long been characteristic 
of colleges of liberal arts. Their work is essentially collegiate, in which respect 
they differ from the older seminaries for women, which, while making more or less 
provision for the distinctive studies of the college curriculum, are schools for general 
  
  
     
         
          instruction.

EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 897 
An interesting commentary on the higher education of women in the United States 
is mado by Miss Sara A. Burstall, B. A, (University of London), a scholar of Girton 
College, Cambridge, England, and mistress at the North London Collegiate School 
for Girls. Miss Burstall was one of the five teachers sent by the Gilchrist trustees 
to America during the Chicago Exposition to study educational institutions. From 
her book, The Education of Girls in the United States,! the following extracts are 
made: She says that ‘in America, as in England, university education for women. 
has been modeled on the system already existing for men. * * * The English 
distinction between a college and a university does not obtain in America; there the 
words are used indiscriminately for degree-giving bodies. * * * The system 
of certain prescribed and certain elective subjects still widely prevails. * * * 
This system appears to encourage superficiality, * * * but an admirable cus- 
tom is that of post-graduate work. * * * For the sake of post-graduate study, 
students often work at two or even more universities, as in Germany. * * * 
The poorer colleges thus have an important work in reaching persons who, but for 
their influence, might never have any higher education at all, and who may be 
stimulated to go on to a real university when once they have tasted the sweets of 
Jeaming: = 8y="-* 
“The most important institutions giving a college education to women are the 
soparate women’s colleges, founded by private munificence, having their own char- 
ters to give degrees and their own independent staff of teachers, the head being in 
almost every case aman. The four largest and most esteemed of these are Vassar, 
Wellesley, Smith, and Bryn Mawr; of these we give separate accounts below. The 
great universities and colleges for men have not been as a rule open to women, 
though at tho present time signs of a change are clearly visible. Thus ‘annexes’ 
have grown up at Harvard, Cambridge,* and Columbia, New York.? These are 
organizations for giving women the college education men have at these seats of 
learning. Some of the privately endowed universities recently founded sre, how- 
ever, open to women on exactly the same conditions as to men; the chief of these is 
Cornell, Ithaca, N. Y. We much regret that time did not allow of our visiting this 
institution, one of the most important in connection with the question of coeducation. 
The new University of Chicago has followed the example of Cornell. The Western 
State universities are also open to women; chief among these is the University of 
Michigan, which has influenced the university education of women in America more 
than any other institution. 
“There is much discussion among American cducators as to whether it is better 
to send a girl to a separate women’s college or to a coeducation university, and pub- 
lic opinion is very strong on both sides. The matter does not turn on the question 
of securing the higher and most advanced teaching, though that is considered, but 
rather on social conditions. Some persons object to the conventual character of the 
women’s colleges, isolated as they are from the outside world; others think the calm 
and freedom from tho distractions of social life a positive advantage. We shall, 
however, discuss this more fully in the chapter on coeducation.t There is at least 
one other great institution admitting women, which, though not strictly a univer- 
sity, for it gives no instruction in ancient languages, is yet of very high rank and of 
great importance—we mean the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 16 grants 
the B. 8. degree, and women have studied there for some years, principally natural 
science and economics; some have studied architecture. 
“All the chief women’s colleges require an entrance examination somewhatsimilar

4It is not intended to touch upon coeducation and coeducational institutions, as this subject has 
been treated elsewhere; but inasmuch as most of the writers from whom citations are made deal 
with both phases of college training, it has been found impossible to avoid encroaching upon that 
phase of education.

to the matriculation cxamination of the University of London, but not so diffi- 
cult. Vassar, Wellesley, and Smith accept the certificates of certain schools as 
substitutes for the examination; Bryn Mawr recognizes no school certificate, only 
that of the Harvard examinations for women being taken. Girls seem to enter at 
about the same age as in England, possibly cn the whole when somewhat younger; 
16 is the limit fixed by the college authorities, The students scem as mature in 
appearance and demeanor as our English college women, but the American colleges 
themselves seem rather to resemble boarding schools. Tho whole morning is taken 
up with recitations, as in school; the girls have little free time, the rules prescribe 
retiring to rest at a fixed hour, etc.; there isa weckly holiday, Saturday or Monday, 
and exeats for the week end are easily and frequently obtained. Some colleges 
adopt the cottage system wholly or in part; the students live in small groups, each 
under the charge of one lady, who is in the position of a mother. There is some- 
thing very sweet and beautiful in these little homes; they are doubtless of the 
greatest value in making college life for a certain type of girl. 
““We heard much from some American educators of the exciting and in some cases 
injurious effect of a large number of girls living together in one building. This 
was said to generate an atmosphere of nervous excitement, the noise of the crowded 
dining hall at meals being particularly bad. The influence of the mass of so many 
young women on one another was also considered by some to be hurtful, tho con- 
ditions being so different from home life. We were not able to understand this 
objection, but there must be some weight in it, for persons of experience and stand- 
ing urge it strongly. The point seems to be that such a system is unnatural, and 
therefore necessarily had. 
“The material equipment is much tho same in all the principal institutions; it is 
on the whole very much finer than anything in England, though none of the build- 
ings for women are as splendid as those of Holloway College. The quadrangle plan 
is rarely used in America, detached buildings being better suited to the cold and 
snows of their winters;| * * * all have good libraries, which are extensively 
used, * * * All have observatories, well fitted with instruments, on which no 
expense has been spared ; here some of thostudents work regularly. * * * Every- 
thing possible in reason seems to be done for the comfort of students. We were 
struck with the uniform excellence of the food served at meals. 
“The relations of the students with the authorities are marked by great friend- 
liness, and by tho absence of any stiffness or formality. This we noticed again and 
again while going over the buildings with numbers of the faculty, waiting in offices 
during the transaction of business, at table, and elsewhere. The life of tho college 
left on the writer’s mind a peculiar impression of restful pleasantness, something of 
the feeling of a home. Wellesley, with its beautiful grounds, its seclusion, its art 
treasures, its traditions, has a spirit of its own, difficult to express in words, but 
felt by one who visits it. Bryn Mawr recalls Girton, though it is in many respects 
different. Vassar is majestic; its grounds have the dignity of fine trees and wido 
lawns; its wealth harmonizes with that of the Empiro State (New York), in which 
itis situated. Smith seemed to the writer to have the characteristics attributed in 
literature to New England. The morning service in its spacious but simple chapel, 
where 700 students meet, is singularly impressive. : 
“We feel, however, very strongly on one point, and after discussing the matter with 
some American authorities we venture to make an adverse criticism, The required 
attendance on lectures is far too large in number of hours. In most colleges fifteen 
hours a week is the rule; some allow more, even twenty hours per week being taken. 
To an English student it appears necessary to devote at least six hours’ preparation, 
and often more, to every hour of lecture. This would mean ninety hours private 
work, which, with the lectures, would make one hundred and five hours per week— 
i.e., seventeen and a half hours per day. This is of course absurd; we therefore

-P-A-G-E-957
EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 899 
conclude that the standard of preparation is not so high as in England. The 
authorities themselves state that about two hours per lecture is expected; this 
would give an eight-hour day. Buta college lecture which only requires two hours’ 
preparation can hardly be considered to reach the standard of university work at 
all. We must accept, therefore, one of two alternatives; the students are over- 
worked, or the work done is not of a very advanced character. When we remember 
that students are often admitted at 16 years of age, we can take the latter explena- 
tion. But it would be in the highest degree unjust to suppose that in the best col- 
leges the standard is, as a rule, low. 
«The writer would suggest that, in the women’s colleges, at all events, the stu- 
dents must, to do justice to their instruction, work long hours, though some of the 
work is not of a very intense kind. This a priori conclusion was borne out by some 
of the phenomena we observed on visiting the women’s colleges. In one we were 
informed that it was very difficult to get the students to avail themselves of the 
opportunities for physical exercise; they never seemed to have any time. As lee- 
tures were given both morning and afternoon, and as tho time between had to be 
filled with reading, laboratory work, etc., we could understand that the custom of 
devoting the early afternoon to physical exercise, as at Cambridge, could not well 
be followed. In two other colleges we were told that great stress was laid on the 
observance of the rule of retiring to rest at 10 p.m. This would be unnecessary if 
the students had more free time, as they would probably then find out for themselves 
how to fit in their work without sitting up late. We were struck by the absence 
of all allusion to that social life among the students in their own rooms which 
forms so important a part of English college life among women, does so much to 
develop self-reliance and thought on subjects apart from study, and, indeed, helps 
so materially toward that maturing of character which is the most important result 
of the years spent at college. 
“Such social life may exist in American colleges; our stay was too short to enable 
us to be positive on the subject, but we heard nothing of it, and we could not see 
where the time for it was to be found. Tho arrangement of rooms, too, in some 
buildings would hinder the rise of such a system. The English ideal, that each 
student should have her own domain—one room or two—does not generally prevail. 
A common rule is to have rooms in suites, two bedrooms and one sitting reom; in 
the main building at Vassar three bedrooms go to each sitting room. In some cel- 
leges two students share a bedroom and a sitting room. Such arrangements lend 
themselves to the formation of college friendships, also an important part of college 
life, but we can not but feel that to put cach student by herself, to let her live alone 
and work alone for some portion of the day, and to give her opportunities of receiy- 
ing her friends in her own rooms, much as ladies do in their houses, tends to develop 
the individual character and to change the school girl into a woman. 
“When we consider how much freer the discipline of American schools is than 
that customary in England, it seems strange that college life there should offer so 
narrow a field for the self-direction of the individual. We feel as certain as a stran- 
ger can venture to be that tho cause of this is the exaction of fifteen hours per week 
attendanco on lectures. Any experienced teacher can understand that quite as much 
advanced work might be done in fewer hours. Indeed, the students would then do 
more, as they would have more time for study. They would also enjoy what is, in 
the writer’s opinion, one of the greatest privileges of English college life among 
women, time to think. In the family the girl has home duties; her school days are 
filled with varying occupations; on leaving college she will have to satisfy the 
claims of practical and professional life or of society. The period between school 
and adult life, spent as it is from the family, in comparative solitude and independ- 
ence, is the time for the growth and maturity of theinner nature. Such a privilege, 
it seems to us, few American college girls can everenjoy. * * * Vassar is, in the 
strict sense of the word, the oldest women’s college in the United States. It was 
founded by Matthew Vassar in 1861, and opened in 1866.

“The college had to face a good deal of ridicule and opposition at first, but now 
holds a recognized place. Other benefactors have added to the endowment provided 
for it by the founder; a new model building for the residence of students, well 
designed and beantifully decorated, was just being finished at the time of our visit. 
There are 430 students, with a faculty of 41, 12 being men. Students are admitted 
after passing the usual entrance examination, or on producing certificates from schools 
approved by a committee ‘of the faculty, the certificates of the regents of the Uni- 
versity of the State of New York, or the certificate of the Harvard examination for 
women. The chief feature of the regular course is the insistence on two languages 
(one of which must be Latin) being studied for two years. Music and art may be 
studied as well as academic subjects. The fee for tuition, board, lodging, and wash- 
ing is $400, music and art being extra. Large sums aro devoted to scholarships for 
students who need aid. * * * Smith Collego was founded in 1875 by Miss Sophia 
Smith, with the object of establishing an institution for the higher education of 
young women, which should give them means and facilities for education equal to 
those in colleges for young men. It has three courses of study: The classical, lead- 
ing to the degree of B. A.; the scientific, to that of B. Sc. (bachelor of sciences) ; and 
the literary, to that of B. L. (bachelor of literature). Art and music are also studies. 
It is difficult to describe these courses without giving elaborate details, as so many 
subjects are required. Electives are allowed, especially in the later years, to be 
selected from a very complete list, which contains the usual academic subjects, art, 
and music. * * * 
“Many of the college students engage in teaching after their college course is 
over; the phrase, ‘a graduate of Smith,’ is quoted in speaking of a woman on the 
staff of a high school, as if it conveyed a special qualification. From this and other 
indications we infer that the college takes a high place in public estimation, * * * 
“The site of Wellesley College is ideal; the various buildings, grouped among 
lawns and fragments of the original forest, and crowning the natural elevations of 
the ground, form a beautiful whole, different from anything we associate with col- 
leges in England, but with a charm and grace peculiarly its own. 
“The president’s report gives an interesting account of the work of the alumnae 
(old students) during the thirteen years which havo passed since the first class 
graduated from the college. Of these 734 graduates, 540 have engaged in educa- 
tional work, 134 have married, 23 have died, 12 hold the medical degree and are 
practicing physicians, 15 are trained librarians, 9 have engaged in foreign and 11 in 
home missionary work. Many of the whole number are in conspicuous positions of 
responsibility. 
“The whole number of students at the date of the last report (1892) is 700. A 
large number who applied for admission were debarred for want of room. The 
officers of the college number 92, 77 being engaged in teaching. Wellesley is 
remarkable for having had from the beginning a woman for its president, and its 
staff is composed almost entirely of women. By the munificence of a special bene- 
factor, tho teachers enjoy what is termed a ‘Sabbatical year;’ that is, they can 
spend each seventh year in study or rest. Most come to England for this purpose. 
Students are admitted on examination or ‘on certificate.’ The college courses are 
two—classical and scientific, leading respectively to the degrees of B. A. and B. Se. 
So much required work and so much clective, amounting to fourteen to sixteen hours 
a week,is the rule. The proportion of students obtaining a degree is unusually 
high. In 1891 there were 123 graduates. Very few students do post-graduate work 
at Wellesley, only 10 appearing out of 700 in the lastlist. * * * 
“The writer spent a day and a night at Wellesley College, and had some oppor- 
tunity of secing the life of the place, and formed a very favorable impression of it. 
The relations between the authorities and the students seemed particularly cordial 
and friendly; the girls, in spite of the somewhat long hours of work, were bright 
and happy looking, and the atmosphere of refinement and kindliness was peculiarly 
delightful. * * *

EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 901 
“Bryn Mawr, near Philadelphia, although it is only 8 years old, having been 
opened in the autumn of 1885, has already taken a very high place among the 
women’s colleges. It has laid itself out to give advanced instruction, and has thus 
a large number of graduate students, 3 of them being certificated students of Girton 
College, 2 wranglers, and 1 who took a first class in the classical tripos. This fact 
gives English people a convenient standard from which to estimate the character of 
the instruction given at Bryn Mawr. The faculty consists of men and women of 
very high standing, including graduates of the great German universities, Zurich, 
Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Cambridge (England), a distinguished Newnham student, 
and the only woman who has taken the D, Sc. in mathematics at the University of 
London. There are 38 instructors and 194 students, 32 being graduates doing post- 
graduate work. Several of these are fellows of the college. Their position is of 
special interest (there not being anything to exactly correspond to it in our English 
colleges). One of the fellowships—that in Greek—is held by the Girton‘student of 
classics mentioned above.! The regulations state: 
“<The most distinguished place among graduate students will be held by the 
fellows, who must reside in the college during the academic year. Nine fellowships, 
of the value of $525 each, are awarded annually. They are open to graduates of 
Bryn Mawr College, or of any other college of good standing.’ 
“Undergraduates are required to pass the Bryn Mawr entrance examination, which 
appears to be nearly equivalent to the matriculation examination of the University 
of London. The only exemption allowed is the Harvard certificate in equivalent, or 
a certificate from a college or university of acknowledged standing. Private schools 
prepare the majority of students. In the current calendar the proportion from pri- 
vate schools is 79.8 per cent; other colieges and universities send 9.8 per cent, and 
high schools only 8.0 percent; the rest (2.4 per cent) were prepared by private study. 
“The course for the B. A. degree requires some English scicnce—or science and 
history—and philosophy. This only occupies paré of the time; the rest must be 
given to the ‘group’ selected by the student. The group system is borrowed from 
the course at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. It is intended to allow some 
degree of specialization, with provision for width of view by combining subjects. 
Five groups are arranged, as follows: (1) Any language with any language; (2) Any 
science with any science; (3) Mathematics with Greek and Latin; (4) Mathe- 
matics with physics; (5): History with political science. | 
* * * «The research system in the colleges and universities * * * is worthy 
of careful attention by those interested in collegiate instruction for women. It is 
certainly true that much of the post-graduate work in American colleges corresponds 
in standard to that done in preparation for an honor degree at Oxford and Cambridge, 
but the method is different, the students being taught how to do research, and not 
being required to consider what is demanded by the examiners. It seems somewhat 
anomalous that former women students of English colleges should be following 
advanced courses of study in America, under English teachers,? because they were 
unable to find opportunities of doing so at home. 
“The system of fellowships at Bryn Mawr has an important influence on the ques- 
tion of post-graduate work. The Association of College Alumne, a body of college 
women, also grants two fellowships for the encouragement of research. 
“Our second criticism has been made already. It refers to the women’s colleges, to 
their long hours of work, and to the apparent absence of repose and opportunity for 
thought and individual development consequent upon such excessive demands on 
the students’ time. We can add nothing to what has been said already; we can 
only reiterate it.” 
The comparison of English and American institutions, the requirements of study 
from college girls of different ages, the general good health of the average student

who pursues the higher branches aro points which interest Miss Burstall. In the 
citations which follow from The American Girl at College, by Miss Lida Rose McCabe, 
more stress is placed upon the individuality of the woman. She says: 
* Probably the college-bred woman is the most observed woman of the present day. 
After twenty years of intellectual gestation she begins to impress her individuality 
on the community. Discussions of eminent men as to women’s mental ability, 
moral and physical status, predilection for matrimony, or fitness for voting have 
been going on for a quarter of a century. 
“Meanwhile maiden bachelors of arts and science have multiplied, until now 
there are some 3,000 mature women who have had college training, and as many more 
in the heyday of youth, all of whom fall under the surveillance of a public that 
ceases not to question the practical outcome of thismodern innovation. One by one 
objections raised from the intellectual, moral, physical, or matrimonial standpoint, 
have disappeared in the light of statistics. To one tangible phase, however, the 
masses cling with a covert desire to find in it sufficient evidence to outweigh the 
favorable testimony already adduced. 
“Of what avail to women is scientific training? What is the practical outcome 
of higher education? These are questions whose reiteration invites deeper investi- 
gation. The marriage ratio, health statistics, number and physique of the offspring 
of college-bred women attest that, if scientific training does not facilitate, it cer- 
tainly does not interfere with the radical function of her being. That higher 
education enlarges her opportunities as a breadwinner is irrefutable. 
“Tn proportion as the price of skilled labor advances, the college-bred woman’s 
earnings will undoubtedly increase. Unhappily nothing short of an audited account 
in dollars and cents of the earnings of every college woman in the breadwinning 
world—earning the direct outeome of knowledgo garnered within tho walls of their 
alma mater—will satisfy a large portion of the community that higher education 
has a raison d’étre. 
“Coming as it does at an epoch when women are largely a factor in the indus- 
trial prosperity of the country, the desire to know tho practical end to which the 
college-bred woman is able to put her superior training, when thrown upon her 
own resources for a livelihood, is under the circumstances natural, and consequently 
wholesome, 
“Results alone justify innovations. To define at present the practical outcome of 
higher education is nevertheless as impossible as would be an exhibit of philan- 
thropy or religion. To estimate the work of the present demands the eyes of a 
future age. As woman’s colleges are said to have been founded on the HeHenic idea 
of ‘culture for culture’s sake,’ authorities have not found it incumbent to follow 
the material fortunes of the aluamne. Masculine colleges or universities do not 
anticipate or define the careers of the young men they annually set adrift. Why, 
then, should women be required to render an account of their stewardship? logically 
argue the official heads. But public interest in tangible results is persistent and 
insatiable. Colleges are now beginning to gather data to satisfy this prevalent 
desire. The Vassar and Wellesley calendars of 1891 and the souvenir of the Mount 
Holyoke semicentennial throw interesting light upon the varied pursuits in which 
their alumne have found practical activity. Smith, Harvard Annex, and Bryn 
Mawr have no record, nor has any been kept by the ceeducational institutions. 
Nevertheless, all are more or less rich in individual recollection of exceptional 
careers. Tho evidence that higher education has elevated and broadened the oppor- 
tunity and raised the monetary value of woman in the first field in which she found 
a marketable outlet for her intellect is conclusive. Teaching, with increasing equip- 
ment and ripening sense of responsibility, retains its hold on college women. One- 
fourth of the women who go to college go with teaching as the end in view. In 
keeping with the growth of colleges, preparatory schools have multiplied, until now 
there is scarcely a town of importance from the Atlantic to the Pacific that has not

a preparatory school in the keeping of a B. A. or an A. M. of Vassar, Wellesley, 
Smith, Bryn Mawr, the Annex, or some coeducational university. The insufficient 
preparation of students who applied for admission retarded the growth of women’s 
colleges. So few in number and incompetent in faculty were girls’ preparatory 
schools that Vassar and Wellesley were forced for some years to sustain academic 
or preparatory departments. This is now obviated, thanks to the number of skilled 
women sent forth yearly by the colleges to successfully conduct private enterprises, 
the certificates of many of which are recognized by Harvard and other leading col- 
leges. In higher and special fields of instruction, in many conservative seats of 
learning, the college women now stand on equal footing, mentally and financially, 
with the men professors. It was not so much intolerance of sex as want of higher 
training that debarred her formerly.” * * * 
GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE WOMAN MOVEMENT. 
If this movement could be followed in its entirety in this country or throughout 
the world, it would be a matter of extreme interest, but much must necessarily be 
omitted in an essay of this kind, and, further, the subject has been quite thoroughly 
treated by different authors. 
The following citations from Woman’s Work in America, by Annie Nathan Meyer, 
taken in conjunction with the college tables on preceding pages, will show the 
onward movement of the woman question in different parts of the United States. 
In the introduction to the above-mentioned work Mrs. Julia Ward Howe states 
that ‘a comprehensive view of the attainments made by American women in this 
century, and especially during the last fifteen years, can not but be of great impor- 
tance and value. The cruel kindness of the old doctrine that women should be 
worked for and should not work, that their influence should be felt but not recog- 
nized, that they should hear and see but neither appear nor speak—all this belongs 
now to the record of things which, once measurably true, have become fabulous. 
“The theory that women should not be workers is a corruption of the old aristo- 
cratic system. Slaves and servants, whether male or female, always worked. 
Women of rank in the Old World were not necessarily idle. The Eastern monarch 
who refused an army to a queen, sent her a golden distaff. The extremes of despot- 
ism and of luxury, undermining society and state, can alone have introduced the 
theory that it becomes the highly born and bred to be idle. With this unnatural 
paralysis of woman’s active nature came ennui, the bane of the so-called privileged 
classes. From ennui spring morbid passions, fostered by fantastic imaginations. A 
respect for labor lies at the very foundation of a true democracy. 
“The changes which our country has seen in this respect and the great uprising 
of industries among women are, then, not important to women alone, but of momen- 
tous import to society at large. The new activities sap the foundation of vicious 
and degraded life. From the factory to the palace the quickening impulse is felt, 
and the social level rises. To the larger intellectual outlook is added the growing 
sympathy of women with each other, which does more than anything else to make 
united action possible among them. A growing good will and esteem of women 
toward women makes itself happily felt and will do even more and more to refine 
away what is harsh and unjust in social and class distinctions and to render all alike 
heirs of truth, servants of justice. 
“Tho initiative is now largely taken by women in departments in which they 
were formerly, if admitted at all, entirely and often unwillingly under the dictation 
ofmen. Philanthropists of both sexes, indeed, work harmoniously together, but in 
their joint undertakings the women now have their say, and, instead of waiting to 
be told what men would have them think, feel obliged to think for themselves. The 
result is not discord, but a fuller and freer harmony of action and intention. In 
industrial undertakings they still have far to go, but women will enter more and 
more into them and with happy results. The professions, indeed, supply the

keystone to the arch of woman’s liberty. Not the intellectual training alone which 
fits for them, but the practical, technical knowledge which must accompany their 
exercise puts women in a position of sure defense against fraud and imposition.” 
The gradual educational development of woman in the Eastern States may be 
traced through a ‘study of the history of those States. This would lead, however, 
to research over more than a century of human progress. Generally speaking, tho 
boys had opportunities for school instruction of different grades, while in earlier 
times the girls were limited to home instruction until the earlier part of this 
century. 
“By the close of the eighteenth century most towns in New England had made 
some slight provisions for educating girls; how slight almost any early town history 
willshow. * * * In 1789 great educational advance was madein Boston. Asys- 
tem was adopted which provided a ‘Latin school’ for fitting boys of 10 years old and 
over by a four-years course, including Greek and Latin, for the university; also 
three reading and writing schools.! 
“Boys had the right to attend these all the year round; girls from the 20th of 
April to the 20th of October. This was the first admission of girls to the ‘free 
schools.’” eee, 
Then, again, in tracing the historical development, Miss Eastman quotes Abigail, 
wife of President John Adams, who said: ‘The only chance for much intellectual 
improvement in the female sex was to be found in tho families of the cducated 
class and in occasional intercourse with the learned of the day. Whatever of 
useful instructicn was received in the practical conduct of life came from maternal 
lips, and what of further mental development depended more upon the eagerness 
with which the casual teachings of daily conversation were treasured up than upon 
any labor expended purposely to promote it. Female education in the best families 
went no further than writing and arithmetic, and in some few and rare instances 
music and dancing.” 
Of woman’s culture in the different States, Miss Eastman says: 
“Tho young ladies of Massachusetts in the last century were certainly readers, 
even though only self-taught, and their taste was not for the feeble and nerveless 
sentiment or.the frantic passion of our day, but was derived from the deepest wells 
of English literature. The superb flowering of native mental gifts in many women 
of the last part of the eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth centuries, 
under so slight stimulus of educational advantage, would almost force upon us the 
theory of Descartes, that ‘in order to improve the mind we ought less to learn than 
to contemplate,’ and lead us to accept the dictum of Huxley, that all the time we 
are using our plain common sense we are at once scientists and artists. * od 
“The ‘third and fourth decades of the nineteenth century marked an epoch in edu- 
cation through the service done by a few teachers who seemed to have fresh inspira- 
tions as to the capabilities of women and practical ability to embody them. They 
helped to verify the forecast of Rev. Joseph Emerson, principal of the academy at 
Byfield, Mass. 
“Mr, Emerson was deeply interested in the theme of the millennium, and regarded 
women in the capacity of cducator, as the hope of the world’s salvation. Unlike 
his contemporaries, he believed in educating young women as thoroughly as young 
men, and in 1822 predicted ‘a time when higher institutions for the education of 
young women would be as needful as colleges for young men.’ ” 
Among the early pioneers in the education of girls was Mrs. Emma Hart Willard, 
born in 1787 in Connecticut, whose life work will always be associated with that of 
Troy Female Seminary. Brought up amidst cultured people, she carly became con- 
vinced that the young people of her own sex were capable of grasping the higher 
branches of knowledge, and that such mental development should not be limited to 
boys alone.

As an outcome of the work accomplished in that seminary, many institutions! ofa 
similar grade have sprung up all over the country, in the South particularly, and 
“two-thirds of them confer degrees.” 
The early history of this movement would be incomplete without reference to Mount 
Holyoke, which, dating from 1836, was organized by Mary Lyon and aimed to have 
a ‘course equal to that required for admission to college.” Since 1888 this seminary 
and college is authorized ‘‘to confer such degrees and diplomas as are conferred by 
any university, college, or seminary of learning in this Commonwealth.” 
The education of women in the Western States is so intermingled with that of the 
boys, in coeducational institutions, that it is almost impossible to give even the 
merest historical sketch without trenching upon a subject beyond the aim of this 
chapter. 
For such information reference is made to the chapters on coeducation in the 
Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1891-92, and its continuation elsewhere 
in this report. 
The Government's early attitude toward the education of woman is thus stated by 
Mrs. May Wright Sewall.? She says: 
“Higher education in the West has been fostered by the National Government, by 
the governments of the separate States, by many different denominations of the 
Christian church, and by individual enterprise and devotion. 
“‘As a large number of the strongest institutions in the West open to women owe 
their origin to provisions made by the General Government, it is fitting to direct our 
first inquiry to the relations of that Government to education in the West. On 
May 25, 1785, the Continental Congress passed an ordinance disposing of lands in the 
Northwestern Territory, by which it was decreed that ‘there shall be reserved lot 
No. 16 of every township for the maintenance of public schools within said town- 
ship.’ On July 13, 1787, the famous ordinance relating to the government of the 
territory northwest of the Ohio River was passed. Init occurs the passage which is 
so frequently cited in proof that the United States Government stands pledged to 
aid tho higher as well as the lower education, viz, ‘Religion, morality, and knowl- 
edge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools 
and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.’ Ten days later Congress 
passed another ordinance fixing the terms of sale for the tract of land purchased by 
the Ohio Company. This ordinance stipulated not only that section 16 of every 
township should be reserved for the maintenance of schools, but also ‘ that two com- 
plete townships shall be given perpetually for the purposes of an university, to be 
laid off by the purchaser or purchasers as near the center as may be, so that the 
same shall be good land, to be applied to the intended object by the legislature of 
the State.’ 
“In these ordinances of 1787 we find the germ of all our State universities in the 
West.” * * * 
The early efforts of different denominations to so educate girls that they become 
worthy helpmates in the battle of life are clearly defined by Mrs. Sewall, and she 
states that “the colleges under Methodist control have been generally first and fore- 
most in opening their opportunities to women.” 
The extent of coeducation and coeducational institutions in the West is such that 
one may almost say there are no women’s colleges, for out of 249 higher institutions 
209 are coeducational, and therefore only about one-sixth’ are devoted to female edu- 
cation. ‘ But,” to quote Mrs. Sewall again, ‘‘almost without exception the women’s 
colleges in the West include preparatory departments; very generally the attend- 
ance in the preparatory department exceeds that in the collegiate; frequently mem- 
bers of the faculty divide their attention between preparatory and collegiate classes;

generally the courses of study offered aro less numerous and less complete than those 
offered in colleges of liberal arts for men; most of these institutions have paltry or 
no endowments. 
“With all these limitations, some of them do much creditable work; but at pres- 
ent they occupy a rather vague, indefinite position between ‘the ladies’ seminary’ 
of thirty years ago and the modern college. * * * Among colleges characterized 
from birth by a liberal and progressive spirit may be mentioned the Cincinnati Wes- 
leyan Woman’sCollege. This institution was chartered in 1842, and claimsto be ‘the 
first liberal collegiate institution in the world for the exclusive education of women.’ 
This claim sounds somewhat boastful, but a perusal of the discussions which were 
ealled forth by the establishment of this college will convince one that its under- 
taking was novel and quite forcign to the thought of its public, if not, indeed, quite 
unprecedented in the world’s history.” 
After speaking of the limitations in Western colleges and of the giving of honors 
too casily, Mrs. Sewall says: 
““The growth of progressive thought in the West concerning the social and civil 
position and the industrial and professional freedom of woman tends to supply 
woman with incentives to obtain the best education, and the defects in their educa- 
tion hitherto caused by the absence of incentive promise to be remedied with 
increasing rapidity.” 
The same criticism may be made in regard to Western colleges as is made on insti- 
tutions elsewhere in this country, that the averago requirements for admission 
should be raised, and then secondary schools could maintain a higher standard. 
This suggestion lends itself to the general discussion of such subjects and is in no 
wise limited to any special section. 
The educational facilities offered to the women of the South have greatly increased 
of late years. Formerly it was conceded that it was not “desirable to give her any 
other education than what sufficed to make her a good housewife and an agreeable 
but not too critical companion for her husband.” But, as is stated by Christine 
Ladd Franklin:! é 
“It is plain that so long as this view of the function of women prevails they will 
have little incentive and little opportunity for undertaking the severe labors which 
are the necessary condition of a solid education. The lighter graces which are sup- 
posed to result from a little training in French and music and from some study of 
English literature have for a long time been accessible to Southern girls, both in 
schools of their own and in the numerous private and fashionable schools of Balti- 
more, Philadelphia, and New York. When a girl was a member of a thoroughly 
cultivated family she naturally became a cultivated woman.” * * * 
It is not to the purpose to trench upon the subject of secondary education in the 
Southern part of this country (except perhaps to mention the establishment of the 
Bryn Mawr Preparatory School in Baltimore in 1884), but merely to touch upon 
the historical phases of higher education in the various sections. As in the North, 
so in the South, says the same writer, the Moravians ‘‘have been foremost among 
the religious denominations in the establishing of schools for girls of a thorough if 
not of an elementary type”—and she quotes, as of widespread influence, the Salem 
Female Academy, opened in 1804, ‘‘among the foothills of the Blue Ridge,” which 
has educated between 6,000 and 7,000 pupils. 
“In January, 1839, the Georgia Female College (now the Wesleyan Female Col- 
lege) was opened at Macon, Ga. It had from the beginning the power of conferring 
degrees, and 11 young women took the degree of A. B. in 1840. It is commonly said 
that this is the first college for women that ever existed. Thatit was called a college 
was doubtless merely owing to the politeness of the Georgia legislature.” * * * 
Mrs. Franklin states that ‘the years about 1840 seemed to have been a period of 
general awakening,” for about that date were established the Judson Institute, 
1In Woman’s Work in America, by Annie Nathan Meyer.
-P-A-G-E-965

founded by the Baptists in Alabama in 1839; the Greensborough Female College 
(Methodist), which, the “first incorporated college for women in North Carolina,” 
obtained its charter in 1838, but received students first in 1846; the Frederick 
Female Seminary of Maryland, incorporated in 1840 and opened in 1843; St. Mary’s 
School, at Raleigh, N. C., opened in 1842. 
Frequently it is asserted that the collegiate education of women does not exist in 
the South, but, as Mrs. Franklin says: 
“In many a Southern family the question whether a girl shall go to college or not 
has become, at least, a question to be discussed. It rests largely with existing col- 
lege graduates to determine whether a sentiment in favor of the higher education 
fer women shall grow rapidly or slowly, and whether schools for ‘superior instruc- 
tion’ shall be or shall not be improved in quality. It is not necessary that every 
girl should go to college, but it is necessary that some should go, for there is abso- 
lntely no other way of keeping up the standard of the lower schools except by 
making sure that they give poet instruction as will stand the test of the college- 
entrance examinations. = 
“The real colleges for women in the South consist of the Woman’s College of 
Baltimore (the only representative in the South of separate education for women of 
a collegiate grade), and the coeducational colleges (including in that term those 
in which the management and the degrees are the same for the men and the women, 
though the recitations may be conducted separately). Of these, the University of 
Texas, the Tulane University (which is the State University of Louisiana), the Uni- 
versity of Mississippi, and the Columbian University in Washington are the impor- 
tant ones. The admission of women into all of these universities is of very recent 
date, and may be taken as.an indication of a general movement in favor of a greater 
degree of generosity toward women, which may in time sweep over tho: entire 
South. Tho geographical d ees of these entering wedges is worthy of note. 
Baltimore and Washington on tho north, the University of Missouri on the west, the 
Stato universities of the three States of the extreme Southwest; add to this the fact 
that the State of Florida has every one of its four colleges for men open to women, 
and that it has not a single girls’ seminary of the old-fashioned type, and it may 
well bo believed that the modern idea of what a woman requires in the way of 
education is destined to close in upon the entire Southern country, and that tho con- 
tentment which Southern women have hitherto shown with the unsubstantial parts 
of learning will eventually be replaced by more far-reaching claims.” * * * 
Such, in brief, aro the main points pertaining to the education of women in Amer- 
ica. Much of interest has necessarily been omitted; the principal effort has been to 
group together statements in a condensed form which are widely scattered and, 
therefore, not always available to persons desiring information in regard to woman’s 
status and the progressive movements in the education of girls.

The endeavor is made in the following pages to portray the conditions, as far as 
possible, attendant upon the higher education of women in different countries, and 
also, as far as possible, to present statements anent the women’s colleges, as apart 
from the coeducational institutions. The latter are referred to, however, as the sub- 
ject could not be properly treated if these developments of the new era were omitted. 
This presentation is only a tentative one, and there are many lacuna, butitis thought 
probable that these very lacune may be the means of bringing out information 
heretofore unavailable.

The establishment of Girton College and Newnham, and the developments at Oxford 
and Cambridge universities are so fully treated in the chapter on “Facilities for the 
university education of women in England,” by Mrs. M. F. Crow, which precedes 
this, that information appertaining to those institutions has been purposely omitted 
here. There are certain points of interest which will be presented, however. The 
movement in regard to the higher education of women in England is of compara- 
tively recent origin, for it is only within the last forty years that the subject has 
been actively discussed, its initiative being in 1846-47. Queen’s College, for the 
education of governesses, was the first to apply for a charter, which, granted in 1853, 
was the ‘first formed public sanction given in modern times to the principle that 
the education of English women was not less important or less worthy of honor than 
that of men.” 
Two of the leaders in this advance movement for women were Miss Buss, head 
mistress of the North London Collegiate School, and Miss Beale, principal of the 
Ladies’ College in Cheltenham, both of whom were trained in Queen’s College. 
In 1849 Bedford College, of similar purpose, was established, but it differentiated 
itself from Queen’s College by holding aloof from denominational influences. 
Now a period of seventeen years intervenes until there comes the request for the 
admission of girls to the local examinations at the University of Cambridge, and 
this is soon followed by a movement at Oxford which, instead of classing the girls 
separately, as in the Cambridge plan, placed all candidates on alist giving the 
results of examinations, irrespective of sex. Various associations were formed from 
time to time, all aiming, by means of lectures and classes, to give similar advanced 
instruction to women as is given to men in the universities. Among these may be 
named the North of England Council for the Higher Education of Women, and an 
offshoot, the Ladies’ Council of the Yorkshire Council of Education. These led in 
the higher educational movements for women, but similar associations were soon 
formed in the majority of the large towns of England and in university centers of 
Scotland and Ireland. 
In 1869 came the first developments of Girton' College; in 1873 of Newnham,! 
which only aimed at first to thoroughly prepare for the Cambridge local examina- 
tions, but many of the students have ‘‘shared the privilege granted to the Girton 
students of informal examination in the tripos? subjects.” 
Alexandra College and Queen’s Institute, both in Dublin, were among the earlier 
institutions for the higher education of women in Great Britain. The latter aimed 
to be technical in character, but lack of general culture in the students who desired 
to enter led to a change of plan in favor of more general instruction. 
The most ancient seats of learning, Oxford and Cambridge, are developments of 
the old monastic system, and still retain many mediwval customs; in direct contrast 
are the modern institutions, such as London, Durham, Victoria, and tho University 
of Wales. London University, founded in 1836, is an examining and degree-confer- 
ring body, which aims to develop ‘into a teaching as well as examining university.” 
Since 1878 women have been admitted to the faculties of arts, sciences, medicine, law, 
and music. There is no theological faculty. A special medical school for women 
was opened, whose degrees give very high standing in the medical profession. In 
this university? women stand equally with men. They take part in the government 
of the university, except that they do not vote for a member of Parliament, as do 
the male members of the governing bodies.

certificate in the higher local examinations. 
2The University of London, on presentation day, 1895, gave Miss E. A. S. Dawes the degree of 
Litt. D., the first woman to receive the degree. Of the 253 bachelors of art, 80 were women, and 
women students received 8 of the 20 M. A., 10 of the 81 B. Sc., 8 of the 77 B. M., and 10 of the 47 
M. D. degrees conferred.

Liverpool, and Leeds, examines, says the charter, ‘all persons, male and female, 
who shall have pursued a regular course of study in a college in the university.” 
Women are not admitted to the medical schools of this university. 
Wales, the youngest university, comprises the colleges of Bangor, Cardiff, and 
Aberystwith. Its charter (1894) says that ‘women shall be eligible equally with men 
for admittance to any degree which the university is by this our charter authorized 
to confer; every ofilce hereby created in the university and the membership of every 
authority hereby constituted shall be open to women equally with men.” The gov- 
erning body is the university court. Some of its members must by charter be 
women, and there is at present one lady member of the senate. 
Durham now acknowledges women, and a petition’ requests the privilege of so 
altering the charter as to confer degrees on duly qualified women in all subjects 
except theology. 
On March 3, 1896, a resolution? was submitted to the congregation of the Univer- 
sity of Oxford, which, if carried, would have had the effect of conferring the B. A. 
degree on women students who had complied with the conditions of residence and 
examination required of men for that degree, limited by the further condition that 
the woman B. A. must have passed in honors. In making a plea for woman’s higher 
education, Millicent Garrett Fawcett? says: 
“The vitality of every ancient institution may be tested by the power which it 
shows of adapting itself to modern changes and the growth of modern life. The 
ancient universities have shown this vitality in many directions, by the introduc- 
tion of greater variety into their curricula, by opening their doors to nonconform- 
ists, by the help they have afforded to secondary education through their local 
examinations for boys‘and girls, by the invention and vigorous promotion of what 
is called university extension—by means of which more than 60,000 persons of both 
sexes are each year receiving instruction of a'systematic character—and last, but not 
least, they have shown their vitality by accommodating themselves to a social change 
which has already taken place, one of the manifestations of which is a demand on 
the part of women to sharo in the blessings of university education.” 
In speaking of the effect of higher study upon women, the point is often made 
that such study tends to break down the health. Here again Mrs. Fawcett says: 
“Women at Cambridge have been taking the same university course as men for 
twenty years, and have suffered no injury to their physique. A few years ago Mrs, 
Sidgwick made a most laborious statistical inquiry into the effect of academic work 
on the health of women. For this purpose she investigated the physical history of 
more than 500 women students of Oxford and Cambridge, and compared it with that 
of their sisters who had not had academic training, and also with that of their par- 
ents and brothers. The result was that the statement that a university course was 
injurious to the health of women entirely broke down.” 
Latest advices from England indicate that two educational bodies have reported. 
favorably in regard to the subject of university degrees for women. These are the 
Church Schools Company, 18 out of 24 head mistresses signing the memorial, and 
the Girls’ Public School Company, whose petition was signed by 34 out of 36 head 
mistresses. 
The advance in noncollegiate graduate study is noticeable through the,step taken 
by the London School of Economics, which is under joint control of the Chamber 
of Commerce and the Society of Arts. Its courses cover commercial history and 
1The authorities of Durham University have received an intimation that their petition for a modi- 
fication of the charter, such as would enable them to confer degrees upon women, has been granted. 
There will henceforth be no distinction of sex among the alumni of the university (except, we 
presume, in the faculty of theology). The University of Wales remains, of course, the most com- 
prehensive of all the British universities in this respect, having been founded without sex distine- 
tions, even for the teaching staff and the governing authorities. (Atheneum.) 
* The proposal was rejected by a vote of 215 to 140.

geography, taxation, economics, political science, commercial and industrial law. 
The school opened with 200 students of both sexes, such as teachers, journalists, 
government employees, clerks from mercantile offices, experts, and persons from the 
municipal civil service. 
In addition to all that is being done in other parts of Great Britain in the matter 
of higher education, the University of St. Andrews offers all advantages to women, 
and the other universities of Scotland offer similar advantages to those obtained at 
Oxford and Cambridge. Besides these opportunities there are others; for instance, 
Queen Margaret’s College is the only college for women in Scotland really on the 
lines of a university and fitting its students for university degrees as soon as these 
are thrown open to women. It is the outgrowth of a smallscheme started by a few 
ladies for the higher education of women some fifteen years ago. To this scheme 
the Glasgow University gave most generous sympathy, and after the usual vicissi- 
tudes the scheme grew until it finally became incorporated as a college, to which a 
wealthy woman gave the present buildings as a home. It has about 200 women 
students pursuing studies in art, science, and medicine under a staff of professors, 
many of whom are identical with those of the university. 
The work of the associations for the university education of women, both in Glas- 
gow and Edinburgh, has been of inestimable value to those desiring a higher educa- 
tion, for on October 19, 1892, the University of Edinburgh opened not only its 
courts, but its arts classrooms, to women students on the same terms as men. The 
Scottish University commission now gives greater latitude to the subjects of study 
for a degree. 
As a matter of interest to those who are observing the gradual development of 
the ‘‘ mouvement feministe,” a résumé of an address is given. “It is by the Right Hon- 
orable the Countess of Aberdeen, and was delivered at a meeting of the Edinburgh 
Association for the University Education of Women on April 22, 1885. Prior to the 
commencement of the meeting, the Edinburgh University certificate in arts was 
presented to those who were successful in competing for it. The Countess first 
referred to the work accomplished by the association and to its eminent usefalness. 
She hoped that she would be excused “for feeling a pardonable pride when consid- 
ering the life and growth of the association, and all that has been accomplished by 
its means.” 
The Countess remarked that ‘(many of the young men students of the university 
might feel jealous if they heard the opinion passed by the professors on the equality 
of the work which they meet with at the ladies’ classes.” This association has always 
laid claim to the right of women to be admitted by the universities to the same 
classes and the same degrees on the same level as men, and has been unremitting in 
its efforts, along with other kindred societies, in pushing through the universities 
bill, which enables the Scottish universities to deal with the graduation of women. 
With this bill a law, the higher education of women would be recognized by the 
outward badge of a degree being conferred. The Countess of Aberdeen refers to 
the terror which some persons feel when the subject of the university education of 
women is mooted, and says: 
“Tt is incumbent on every educated woman to show that her education does not 
merely megn that she has gained so much knowledge herself, or possibly the power 
of imparting it to others, or that she is henceforth to devote herself to the main idea 
of bringing out some literary or scientific work. It may mean all this; but let it 
also mean that it has so enlarged and developed her mind and reasoning powers as 
to enable her to be more and more the bright, intelligent companion of father, hus- 
band, or brother; to be the mother who not only will know how to draw out the 
dawning powers of her infant children, but who will realize that her education has 
conferred no greater boon than the power of keeping abreast of and in touch with 
her children as they grow up, instead of being left hopelessly behind.” 
The Countess remarks: ‘How strange it is to see mothers whose care of their chil- 
dren is most solicitous, but who seem to forget that there is another time in their

lives, when they are passing from boyhood and girlhoed into men and women, on 
which much of their future depends, and when she can only retain influence by 
being able to enter into and be in sympathy with their studies and pursuits. Are 
our educated women going to realize that a new power for good on future genera- 
- tions has been intrusted to them in this respect?” 
In speaking of philanthropic and religious work, the Countess remarks that many 
such organizations have failed because the head was not cultivated as well as the 
heart, so that tho lack of executive ability was everywhere apparent. The mention 
of this field of labor shows the need women have of the highest education. The 
Countess of Aberdeen brings out many fine points in favor of the higher education 
of women, but a word which she quotes from the prime minister will suffice as a 
close to the statements made: “Education was not meant to raise men and women 
out of labor, but to enable them to raiso labor.” 
FRANCE, . 
Statistics for 1891 represent France as having 2,750,621 girls studying in primary 
schools and 11,645 in public secondary schools (lycées, colléges, and cours secon- 
daires). In 1891-92 there were 421 women in the university faculties, distributed as 
follows: Two hundred and forty-nine in letters, 29 in science, 129 in medicine, 14 in 
pharmacy. In 1894 there were 50 ‘‘lyeées or colléges de filles,” with 10,011 pupils 
under instruction! The first impetus to higher study came from the law of Decem- 
ber 21-22, 1880, that of July 26-28,1881,? from a decree of November 5, 1881, and 
from the promulgation of the law Camille Sée (so called) in 1882, which laws estab- 
lished lycées for girls, a higher normal for girls—training them for teachers in 
secondary schools—created a number of degrees for women only, and arranged that 
(when sufficiently prepared) women should be teachers in these secondary grade 
schools. 
In tho discussions before the Chamber of Deputies prior to the passage of this 
law M. Camille Sée laid stress upon the fact that the “law is at one and the same 
time a moral law, a social law, and a political law; it concerns the future and safety 
of France, for on women depend the grandeur as well as the decadence of nations.” 
Under the Empire women were allowed to follow university courses and to receive 
university degrees. In fact, the university faculties have never really been closed 
to women, but this fact has hardly been realized until within a few years. When 
women requested to cnter upon the lecture courses it was learned that there was no 
law against such admission. It was apparently between 1865 and 1875 that the 
“Cours du Collége de France” were open to women. At the Sorbonne they were 
admitted about 1872, and thero is an increased attendance each year. In 1892 the 
legal faculty conferred the degree of doctor juris on a woman. In 1889 Mile. Pal, 
botier passed a successful teacher’s examination at the Oriental Academy in Paris- 
being the first woman to pass this examination. In 1866-67 a woman passed the 
examination for the ‘“ baccalauréat és lettres,” being the first woman to obtain this 
degree; but to-day there are several who have the bachelor’s degree in letters or 
sciences, while many are licentiates in these courses. The majority of women pur- 
suing higher studies in France—among them many Russian residents—seek for 
degrees in medicine.t ‘From 1866 to 1882, 109 degrees were conferred upon women 
in France. There have been 49 bachelors of arts, 32 bachelors of science, and 21 
doctors of medicine; 98 degrees have been conferred in Paris alone.” 
Courses of lectures for the intermediate grade of instruction for young girls were

established by M. Duruy, minister of public instruction, in 1867, but the most active 
developments came after the establishment in France, in 1882, of a school system 
based upon the best phases of the school system (so called) of America. The inter- 
est manifested in the woman’s side of education is thus described by Theodore 
Stanton, who says that ‘the day before the Rouen College (lycée) was opened, in - 
October, 1882, the names of 202 girls wero already on the register. The Amiens 
College had during its first term 60 day and 40 boarding scholars. At Lyons, a 
very clerical city, although the college opened very late in the autumn of 1882, some 
AO scholars were in attendance. When the Montpellier College, tho first girls’ col- 
lege in France, was organized it had 76 scholars; at the end of the year more than 
100, and during the autumn of 1882 the lectures were attended by 215 girls. The 
college at Grenoble began on April 17, 1882, with 47 girls, and in January, 1883, 
this number had risen to 112. This same tendency is seen in the lecture courses 
founded by M. Duruy, to which reference has already been made. Whereas in 1875 
these Sorbonne studies were pursyed by 165 girls, in the collegiate year 1881-82 
there were 244, 
“But the Government and the municipalities enter as heartily into the work as the 
women themselves. The Chamber voted, in 1882, 10,000,000 frances for the creation 
of girls’ colleges. Rouen, one of tho first cities to demand a college, found that it 
would cost 1,000,000 francs; the municipality forthwith contributed half that sum 
and the Government the other half. At tho end of the first year after the promul- 
gation of the Sée law the following results had been obtained: The foundation of a 
superior normal school for women at Sévres,! the opening of four colleges, all the 
preliminary steps taken to the same end in 26 other cities, while similar negotiations 
had been begun by 38 other municipalities. 
“Tn the school (or college) at Sevres women are prepared for the lycées. Here 
they work for the certificat d’aptitude and the agrégation. The college is sup- 
ported by the State; students on entrance sign an agreement promising to teach 
under the State ten years after leaving, and the successful candidates have the first 
right to vacant posts in public schools. Private classes may also prepare for these 
examinations; in particular the Collégo Sévigné holds such.” * 
The courses of lectures in the university faculties are divided into ‘cours 
ouverts” and ‘‘cours fermés,” which, as the terms signify, are open-or closed. To 
the former all can go; to the latter only those who have passed the baccalauréat 
and taken a certain number of “‘inscriptions” are presumed to enter. There is 
great liberty, however, and few are turned away who desire to attend. At the 
Sorbonne classes are formed for those of both sexes who desire to prepare for modern- 
language examinations. In the university faculties the ordinary course for a degree 
is thus described by Miss Alice Zimmern: 
“The baccalauréat is a kind of matriculation examination; the boys’ lycées prepare 
their pupils for it, but it is open to all candidates, male and female. The licence is 
an intermediate examination, but for many it is the goal of their studies. At least 
a year must elapse before the baccalauréat and the licence. For the degree of 
doctor theses have to be written and sustained before the faculty. Buta small pro- 
portion of students proceed to this degree.” 
Compared with the number of those who are hearers, few French women have 
qualified themselves for university degrees. Medical instruction for women dates 
from 1868 in the Paris medical school, but of the 169 women students now attending 
these courses only 16 are French; the Russians and Poles outnumber any other 
nationality.? Law students and those in theology are very few in number, as women 
find no career opened to them, but still they are not forbidden such study. Then 
  1Tho normal school at Sévres, presided over by Mme. Jules Favre, wife of tho famous statesman 
of that name, is considered to have wielded much influence. Mme. Favro died in the early part of 
1896, but her influence will long be felt. Mme. Henri Marion now presides over the school.

there are industrial schools for girls, where in a three or four years’ course they 
may receive instruction in modern languages, domestic economy, industrial design- 
ing, cutting and fitting of garments, bookkeeping, and accounts. Kitchen arrange- 
ments and workshops are attached to these schools, so that both theoretical and 
practical instruction may be given. 
Woman in the medical and legal professions is treated under those heads at the 
close of this chapter. 
BELGIUM, 
The question of admitting women to the universities originated in 1875 when M. 
Delcour, minister of the interior, requested an opinion from the various faculties of 
the universities as to the advisability of admitting women. Litge and Ghent pre- 
sented no reason for their exclusion, but suggested awaiting the result of such action 
in other countries. In 1880-81 they were admitted in the free (libre) university of 
Brussels, 3 women following the course in natural sciences; this number increased to 
5 in 1882, and ten years later 75 women had received academic honors—of these 24 in 
natural sciences and 17in pharmacy. According to the laws of May 20, 1876, and of 
April 10, 1890,! women can follow the courses of any faculty and obtain the diploma. 
They may exercise the profession of doctor and pharmacist, but not of lawyer. From 
1882 to 1889 there were 156 women studying in the universities of Brussels, Ghent, 
Liege.? 
An innovation, as it was considered, took place when, in 1892, two young ladies 
received employment in connection with the law courts in Antwerp. They took 
the place of two male clerks at the tribunal of commerce connected with the civil 
courts, 
For years the Government has permitted women to act as telegraphers, telepho- 
nists, etc. 
The “Ligue Belge du Droit des Femmes” has established conferences for women 
since 1890, in which the university professors give lectures in domestic economy, 
hygiene for women and children, anatomy and physiology, medicine, the science of 
education, social economics, elements of law, art of reading, civil and economic con- 
dition of women, and on the laws as they appertain to the woman question.? 
The Belgian Association for the Advancement of Women urges a revision of the 
civil code so that both sexes may have equal rights before the law. Its members 
request the extension of professional education for women, a study of coeducation 
of the sexes in all grades of schools, equal pay to both sexes, wherever they do equal 
work, and the admission of both sexes to various official employments—morality, 
intelligence, and capacity being the only prerequisites. The discussions indicate 
the desire of the association, which now numbers more than 200 members, to benefit 
humanity by giving the woman her proper place before the law, in the hospital serv- 
ice, in connection with public charities, in all official employments, in the adminis- 
tering of school affairs, and by this onward movement to strengthen the woman’s 
position in the family circle as well as outside of it. 
An interesting presentation of this question is made by Isola van Diest, M. D.4 
She says: 
“The situation of woman in Belgium is about the same asin France. * * * 
“A word remains to be said concerning the admission of women to the walks of 
higher education, and notably to the study of medicine. There existedin Belgium 
some years ago a law which required students who would enter the university to 
pass the examination of graduate in letters (gradué en lettres). Candidates for this 
degree were expected to know how to translate Greek and write Latin. But as

there were no schools where girls could study the dead languages with the thorough- 
ness of boys, who were trained six years in the classics, the former wero almost 
entirely shut out from enjoying the advantages of an university courso. This 
graduat, however, no longer exists, and the entrance of women into our univer- 
sities is now possible. Female students are found to-day at Brussels, Litge, and 
Ghent, but their number is still very small. It was in 1880-81 that the first woman 
entered the university of Brussels, but it was not until 1883 that their admission 
became general, They pursue, for the most part, scientific studies, thereby secur- 
ing more lucrative positions as teachers, and pass their examinations for graduation 
with success. Tho higher education of women is still an open question in Bel- 
gium, and thero are those who oppose it. But the experience of Switzerland, 
England, and France, not to mention other countries on both sides of the Atlantic, 
answers Victoriously all objections. And does nct the long list of the world’s dis- 
tinguished women prove that the female sex is capable of the highest intellectual 
culture? Not to go outside of belles-lettres and the limits of Belgium, we have Miss 
Nizet, Marguerite Van de Wiele, the Countess de Kerchove de Denterghem, the 
Loveling sisters, Mrs. Courtmans, Mrs. Van Ackere, and many others.” 
  NETHERLANDS.! 
The greater part of the schools in the Netherlands are mixed schools. Coeduca- 
tion, which was prohibited in France a century ago by Condorcet, is a principle of 
pedagogy in the Netherlands. An interesting presentation of these coeducational 
schools might be made, but the intention here is to simply indicate the advance 
movements in woman’s education, Tho primary schools have 323,415 girls in 
attendance; that is, boys and girls between 6 and 12 years of age are educated 
together. Groningen has a normal school for women teachers, and there are many 
normal courses which they attend. Of the 60 ‘‘middle” schools for boys, 40 had 371 
girls in attendance in 1894, and there are 12 ‘‘middle” schools for girls only. 
Young girls who wish to devote themselyes to higher studies attend the courses of 
the gymnasia or colleges. There are in Holland 29 gymnasia or colleges, of which 4 
are nonsubsidized. These belong to the communes, which have the authority to 
decide whether a college shall be mixed or reserved exclusively for young men. 
This year the Catholic provinces Maestricht and Breda have refused to open their 
colleges to young girls. In the Protestant provinces it is different. Thus, in Amster- 
dam 26 young women are enrolled in the ‘‘lycées;” in Rotterdam, 13. In every 
instance the boys show the greatest deference for their girl companions. A little 
roguishness is sometimes apparent, for the young men refuse to consider their young 
women companions as girls, and give them boys’ names. 
The courses of the four Netherland universities are accessible to women. Between 
1880-81 and 1893-94 the celebrated university of Utrecht had 118 women enrolled. 
This year (1894-95) 55 young ladies were matriculated as students; in Groningen, 
13; in Utrecht, 16; in Leyden, 11; at the communal university of Amsterdam, 15. 
Of these women 11 study medicine, 19 philosophy and letters, 12 natural sciences, 
13 divers branches. Leyden, Utrecht, and Amsterdam universities have already 
graduated a number of women; several are following courses in fine arts; others 
follow the modern language course; still others seek the diploma entitling them 
to teach in secondary schools. Among the students at Amsterdam were women who 
pursued tho studies of French and English literature, the old Dutch language, 
Greek, and Gothic art. Women have the same opportunities as men in the univer- 
sities, and are allowed to enter for any examinations they may desire.? 
Their progress in the medical and legal professions is described under the appro- 
priate headings at the close of this essay.

  EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 915 
DENMARK, 
An article on the legal status of women in Denmark was published by Miss 
Nanna Kristensen-Randers! (exam. juris) in April, 1892, in the Woman’s Journal, of 
Boston. Among other things she says: 
“Teaching has been the principal work of women from ancient times, and they 
have not abandoned it becauso their range of oceupation has been enlarged. On 
the contrary, women have chosen by preference the work of spreading knowledge 
and instruction, and here they have really done eminent service. In this respect we 
have had an excellent pioneer, Miss Natalie Zahle, who, in 1851, foanded a school in 
Copenhagen both for children and grown-up girls. When, in 1860, women were 
admitted to appointments in public schools, she added to her institution a private 
seminary for women, from which in the course of time a great number of admirably 
prepared women have been sent out. In 1875 the University of Copenhagen was 
opened to women, and Miss Zahle immediately organized two new classes, where 
they might be fitted for the university. This largo and excellent school, or rather 
collection of schools, has excited due admiration, as well in our own country as 
abroad. It is governed exclusively by women, and the teaching is chiefly done by 
them also. On the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the school our Govern- 
ment gave Miss Zahle the gold medal of merit. Only one Danish woman, the late 
actress, Mrs. Heiberg, had previously been honored with this token of distinction. 
“Instruction is said to rank rather high here in Denmark, and this is especially 
the case with women. We haye all the more reason to bo proud of the fact, as they 
receive only a very small pecuniary support from the Government. The common 
schools are open to girls, but the higher schools are, as a rule, reserved for boys 
alone. Of late, however, a few of theso schools have begun to admit girls. 
“As mentioned above, women obtained access to the university in 1875, when they 
were given the right to pass all the examinations. Tho theological faculty, how- 
eyer, arranged a special examination for women. But they aro not entitled to obtain 
employments nor to enjoy the stipends, legacies, etc., possessed by the university. 
Seveniy-six women have passed the examination which admits to the university, and 
8 of them have continued their studies. Four of these ladies have become phy- 
sicians, two M. A.’s, and two have passed a higher school examination. 
“ Apart from these, our women students are about equally divided between the 
study of medicine, mathematics, natural science and history, philelogy,ete. One 
woman is studying political economy. Among our theologians thero is no woman 
as yet. The author of this treatise in the summer of 1887 passed the examination 
in jurisprudence, and obtained immediately a situation with a lawyer. But the 
authorities did not think it fitting to appoint a woman as attorney, and our supreme 
court of justice was of the same opinion. 
“Women who have never passed any examination frequent the University of 
Copenhagen in large numbers, as they have free access to the lectures, and two have 
received the university’s gold medal for answering prize questions.* 
“There may be mentioned, as contributing to the education or women, several 
good commercial schools, a drawing school, and an art school for women. It is also 
worthy of notice that every year from 1,600 to 2,000 girls, chiefly servants and peas- 
ant girls, spend three months at our high schools for the people. 
“Among situations held by women may be mentioned, besides the traditional ones 
appointments in banks and similar institutions and in telegraph and post offices. 
Dentistry seems to have some attraction for women. Several have become dentists, 
and women aro admitted to a school of dentistry lately opened. No woman here 
has yet become an apothecary, but one has passed an examination as assistant.

Island of Funen. 
2 Miss Anna Hude received tho medal for historical proficiency,and has been appointed assistant in 
the historical department of the Royal Archives.

“One woman has passed an examination at the agricultural school.! Instruction in 
horticulture is given to women. Among new occuputions may be mentioned that of 
stenographer? in our parliament, a position held by two women. From what has 
been told here it will be seen that Danish women are now able to choose almost any 
work that suits their wishes and abilities.” 
As is stated above, the university was opened to women in 1875. According to 
article 3 of the decree of June 25, 1875,3 women who have given satisfactory proof 
of their ability, when examined for the Artium, are permitted to follow the courses 
and present themselves for the examinations. The decreo stipulates, however, that 
the obtaining of degrees does not permit the women to {ill public positions, to 
receive university scholarships or pecuniary aid from the State. 
From the industrial standpoint there is much to interest one in Denmark. A let- 
ter from Denmark of August 10, 1895, to the New York Evening Post refers to the 
high rate of intelligence among the agricultural population. A large number of 
high-grade industrial schools for men and women (of from 17 to 25 years of age) 
graduate many pupils annually who devote themselves to cattle raising and butter 
making. The women also become proficient in embroidery, silver work, pottery, 
cooking, joining, and cabinetmaking. An exposition held in Copenhagen in 1895 
gave indications also of the intelligence displayed in these industries. 
In Iceland, chief of the dependencies of the Crown of Denmark, an ordinance of 
December 4, 1886, conferred upon women the right to receive the degree of ‘bache- 
lier és lettres,” and admitted them to the schools of medicine and theology in Reyk- 
javik. For the course in law they go to the university in Copenhagen. Women 
may practice medicine, and may present themselves for examinations in philosophy 
and theology. Their success in obtaining degrees does not permit them to become 
Government functionaries, however.‘ Since 1882 women have been permitted to 
vote in connection with local administrative offices 5 and in the selection of the 
clergy of the parish. The instruction of young children in Iceland is given by the 
fireside, the mothers being the earliest teachers. Special schools for girls exist, 
where they are taught higher branches, needlework, and housekeeping, butit is the 
mother who (together with the clergyman) watches over the daughter's education in 
her earlier years.° Should the children fail to be prepared for confirmation great 
would be the chagrin of the parents, and especially of the mother. Thelong winter 
evenings are especially devoted to reading, to the study of folklore, and to incul- 
cating knowledge of events in the country’s history.   
  
NORWAY. 
The status of women in Norway may be learned from the following statements: A 
law of May 22, 1869,7 ‘‘permitted the employment of women teachers in lower grade 
elementary schools;” a law of 1878, ‘admitted women to graduation examinations 
from the middle schools;” one of 1882 ‘‘permitted women to enter for the ‘examen 
artium’ and ‘examen philosophicum.’” This law was complemented by that of June   
1 Fréken Sofil Lauridsen passed the examination, and has been appointed manager of a farm belong- 
ing to M. Tietgen, an eminent Danish financier. This is the first instance, perhaps, of a woman’s skill 
in agriculture being officially recognized. 
2 Miss Grundtvig is stenographer of the House of Representatives (Folkething) in Denmark and 
also director of Kvinden og Samfundet,a journal devoted to the interests of women and of society, 
organ of the Danish Association for Woman’s Emancipation.

14, 1884,! which admitted women to university privileges, gave them the right of 
being examined, of taking the academic degrees, and of receiving scholarships and 
the benefit of legacies accorded to the universities. Since June 26, 1889,? they are 
also eligible to positions on school committees; in rural communes they have equal 
rights with the men in voting for the budget for all school matters, and for the 
appointment of inspectors. Women are also eligible to the position of inspector, 
and in 1890 there were four women elected on the visitors’ board for the schools of 
Christiania. In Norway women have for the last six years been entitled to study 
pharmacy and to manage and own dispensaries, subject to certain conditions. In 
Russia, Finland, and Denmark there are also female apothecaries. Women are also 
studying arts and sciences in the University of Christiania. Higher normal schools 
have lately been opened by the Government for them, as an outgrowth of the results 
of the private training schools for teachers which have been in existence for years. 
A woman’s course in manual training is now a feature of one of the largest private 
schools in Christiania. 
In the “‘Beretning om Skolevesenets tilstand i Kongeriget Norge for aaret 1890,” it 
is said that 117,089 girls were under instruction in the common schools, that 18 pri- 
vate secondary schools for girls had 3,157 students, while 365 girls had passed the 
intermediate grade examinations. Evening schools for girls had 1,246 pupils; the 
courses for teachers of gymnastics were attended by 42 women, and 83 women 
received certificates from normal schools permitting them to teach in lower grade 
schools. The school of arts and trades at Christiania had 131 women in its courses ; 
at Skien a drawing class had 23 girls attending; in three schools 28 women teachers 
were instructing in cutting, drawing, embroidering, etc.; a commercial school in 
Christiania had 58 girls in its classes. The number of women at the university does 
not appear either in that report or in the Universitets og Skole annaler. 
SWEDEN. . 
The subject of woman’s education in Scandinavia has been presented by Mesdames 
Collett? and Olivecrona.‘ The former says ‘Sweden stands first among our north- 
ern States in the movement for the elevation of women. She early outstripped them 
in a more lively and general interest in women’s rights, and the result is that to-day 
the country is blessed with many noble reforms in this direction. This striking fact 
is unquestionably due to the liberal sentiments which Swedish men entertain for 
women themselves, as well as for the cause which these women advocate. From 
early times the men of Sweden have been considered to represent the specifically 
chivalrous virtues of our northern climes, and if the daughters of the land have not 
yet reaped the full benefit of this inestimable national trait, now assuredly the 
harvest time has come.” 
Frederika Bremer, in a novel calied Hertha, published in 1856, first called attention

8Mrs. Camilla Collett, the celebrated Norwegian romance writer, whose cightieth birthday was — 
celebrated in Christiania in tho early part of 1893, is a sister of tho groat Norwegian poet, Henrik 
Wergeland. At the head of the woman’s movement in Norway, she has published many books of 
travel, literary criticism, storics, poetry, and is recognized as a woman of lofty ideas and profound 
judgment. It is said that no private person in Scandinavia, except perhaps Frederika Bremer, has 
done more to raise the respect for the northern woman. Sho died in the spring of 1895. 
4Mrs. Rosalio Ulrica Olivecrona, wife of one of the most distinguished jurisconsults of Scandinavia, 
was born in Stockholm in 1823. For four years she was a teacher in South Carolina, where her favor- 
ito study, botany, led her to collect a herbarium of American plants containing more than 400 speci- 
mens. Sho has written numerous essays on social and educational questions, biographies, stories, and 
poetry; aided in founding “Tidskrift for Hemmet;” became a member of scientific and archwological 
congresses, cte. Mrs. Olivecrona took a leading part in organizing the Swedish department of 
woman's work at the Vienna Exhibition and at the Philadelphia Exhibition. At the request of the 
Swedish commissioners her ‘“ Weiblicho Arbeiten, Schweden ” was translated into English for the 
Centennial, and into French for the Paris Exposition of 1878.

to what was considered to be injustice toward woman, and she may be considered 
the pioneer in the reforms which havo aroused attention and proven that Swedish 
women, too, desire the highest form of education. Mrs. Olivecrona says: 
“The movement for improving the education of women may be said to have been 
inaugurated by the establishment of the Wallin School, in 1831, through the efforts 
of Prof. A. Fryxell, the eminent historian. The next step was the opening, in 1859, 
at Stockholm, of higher classes for young ladies by some influential men who were 
eager to raise the level of female instruction. The tuition, which was gratis, was 
given in the form of lectures and private recitations, and embraced religious exer- 
cises, the natural sciences, mathematics, history, Swedish grammar and literature, 
French, hygiene, and drawing, the scholars being at liberty, however, to choose 
their subjects. This course of study was continued for three years, and having 
met with great success it led to the foundation of the Royal Seminary for the 
Training of Female Teachers (Kong. Seminariet fér bildande af lirarinnor), which 
was opened at Stockholm in 1861.”! * * * A normal schcol established in 1864 
served as a preparatory school to this seminary and also “with the object of afford- 
ing its students an opportunity of gaining some practical insight into the art of 
teaching.” This school has been instrumental ‘in forming a staff of able and well- 
trained female teachers, who now are spread allover the country. The result is that 
in the present day (1832) no town with a sufficient population to maintain a higher 
school for girls will remain unprovided with one.” * 
In Stockholm there are eight or more schools of high grade for girls, all with the 
aim of giving women a good and thorough education. Gymnasial or advanced 
studies aro added to the curricula of some of these schools to prepare pupils for 
university courses. In other cities of Sweden the higher education of girls is sanc- 
tioned, and it is stated that as early as 1883 there was scarcely a “ provincial town of 
note which had not ono or moro high schools due to private munificence or supported 
by the community. Most of them aro in charge of graduates of the Royal Seminary, 
at Stockholm, which is thus extending its beneficial influence all over the King- 
dom. Several good and well-organized boarding schools are also to be found in the 
country.”! 
“JTnstruction for girls is, however, not gratuitous, as is the case in the public 
schools for boys, but there is a Government grant which makes it possible to furnish 
tuition to many scholars in straitened circumstances. 
“The Swedish capital contains many special schools which are frequented by 
women. The Royal Academy of Fine Arts was, in 1864, made accessible to female 
students, but the number being limited to 25, many aspirants are annually turned 
away. The Industrial School was first opened to women in 1854. About 800, of 
whom a large proportion pursue technical studies, attend yearly this institution 
and are allowed to compete for prizes. The telegraphic school, founded by the Gov- 
ernment, has many female pupils. Thero are more than a dozen commercial and 
calligraphic institutes which admit them. Several are conducted by ladies. Tho 
Royal Central Gymnasium is open to women who desire to teach or study gymnastics. 
As early as 1820 female pupils were admitted to this institution, and about 1864 a 
regular course of training was established for women.” 
Women have been admitted also to the Royal Academy of Music since 1854, and 
they have passed the examinations for organists, which includes harmony, singing, 
playing of the organ and piano. The position of musical director has also been 
attained by one lady, at least, who passed (after five years’ study) the above-men- 
tioned examination; also in counterpoint, the history and xsthetics of music, on 
the piano, violin, ete. 
Thero are many women teachers in Sweden, and “even in grammar schools for boys 
competent women are accepted as teachers. Many have obtained diplomas as

gymnasts, and practice with success, both at home and abroad, pedagogic as well as 
medical gymnastics.”! All trades and industries are open to women, and there is 
searccly any branch of industry in which women are not found. 
The fine arts are cultivated by Swedish women, several of whom have obtained 
distinction as musicians, painters, and sculptors; they have become proficient in the 
arts of engraving on wood and glass, in wood carving, lithography, modeling, paint- 
ing on porcelain, and designing, map making, and photography. To these may be 
added art needlework, which has developed—since 1874—through the efforts of the 
Society of Friends of Manual Arts. This society aims to save ancient patterns and 
to revive modes of workmanship practiced by women of bygone days, and to intro- 
duce new modes based upon early national art. 
Feminine slojd, taught to girls of from 7 to 14 years of age, under the supervision 
of the ‘‘Sléjd Inspektorin,” Miss Lundin, was so fully described in the Report of 
the Commissioner of Education for 1891-92 (pp. 428, 429) that this phase of woman’s 
training is here omitted. 
Tho university education of women in Sweden was quite fully treated in the 
reports from the Swedish ladies’ committee to the World’s Columbian Exposition 
at Chicago, 1893. The statements are here appended: 
“In Sweden women are found as teachers, head mistresses of schools, members of 
school boards, lady inspectors, authoresses in pedagogics, etc. The common (or 
national) school education has always been the same for both sexes, but parents not 
desiring to send their girls to such schools send them to the higher schools for girls, 
or to private classes, or have them taught at home by governesses. There are 124 
‘Hégre elementarskolor fér flickor’ which fall under two heads: Endowed schools, 
haying a State annual grant not exceeding 2,000 crowns. They are under State 
control, but at liberty to plan their instruction independently. They number 76. 
Tho schools not endowed belong to parishes, corporations, or private individuals. 
Connected with these schools are continuation schools, preparing for xdmission to 
the university or to the higher training college (admitting pupils at 18 years of age 
to a three years’ course of training as teachers of the higher grade schools), They 
also train teachers or give a general education for practical occupations. Then there 
are the people’s high schools for girls, belonging to the former class. They give 
general education and training in manual work. Free lectures on ethical-religious 
subjects are given in connection with these schools. Housekeeping schools, cooking 
schools, instruction in dairy work, instruction in needlework to teachers, schools 
for home slojd, all aid in the development of woman from the Swedish standpoint. 
“The two universities in Sweden, that of Upsala and that.of Lund,’ were founded, 
respectively, in 1477 and 1668. From both women wero excluded. 
“Tt was not till the fourth decade of our century and in consequence of the move- 
ment for woman’s rights, as well as for a higher standard of female education, that 
a call arose for the abolition of such an antiquated statute. 
“At the Rigsdag of 1865 a Swedish yeoman, Carl Johan Svensén, presented a bill 
for the admission of women to the universities. This bill occasioned a lively 
debate; one side pronounced woman to lack both physical and psychical power to 
carry on Jearned studies; the other side showed how unreasonable it was to form a 
decided opinion on that question when no opportunity had been given woman to try 
the power of her intellect. Her fitness for the professions of teacher and physician 
was specially put forth. Tho result of the debate was a petition for the interven- 
tion of Government demanding for women the right to pass the examinations pre- 
scribed by the law for becoming teachers and physicians. 
“On the 3d of June, 1870, a writ was issued conferring wpon woman the right of 
1Mrs. Olivecrona, in the Woman’s Journal of April and May, 1992. 
2There are two private universities at Stockholm and Géteborg which are only a few years old. 
They admit women. The former has a department of mathematics and natural sciences, also of the 
humanities; the latter has at present a department of humanities. (Thesis of Dr. N. G. W. Lager- 
stedt, presented at Chicago Exposition.)

passing the examination for the university, and of matriculating at the universities, 
and of following the profession of a physician. Since that time the number of 
female students has been increasing year by year. This number, however, only 
comes up to about 1 per cent of that of the male students, who, however, in propor- 
tion to the population are too numerous. 
“During the first years the young ladies passed their examination at some boys’ 
school, but since 1875 the right of qualifying for the university has been conferred 
upon girls’ schools also. At the present moment there are at least five schools that 
prepare female pupils for this examination. 
“The examination for the university is passed either in the classical division 
(latinlinien) or else in the mathematical division (reallinien). 
“The classical division comprises the following compulsory subjects of examina- 
tion: Swedish composition, theology, Latin, French, German, mathematics and 
physics, history and geography, zoology and botany, and propedeutics of philoso- 
phy. Optional subjects are: Greek, Hébrew, and English; one of these languages 
is, however, obligatory. 
“Tn the mathematical division classical languages are not studied, but the claims 
on knowledge in the three modern languages—German, French, and English—in 
mathematics, and in physics are greater than in the classical department and, 
besides, chemistry has to be studied. 
“Most of the women have passed their examination in tho classical department. 
“Of the young ladies who haye passed the examination for the university only 
about 38 per cent have matriculated at the universities. Some have gone back into 
private life and some have found employment as post, railway, or bank officials, or 
else as teachers, * * * 
“The theological faculty in the universities is not open to woman. 
“At the faculty of jurisprudence there are several examinations, out of which 
the one fora ‘candidatus juris utriusque’ is the principal of those most commonly 
taken. It requires about five years’ hard study. This examination has been passed 
by one lady, Miss Elsa Eschelsson. 
“The course of study in the medical faculty extends over seven to nine years from 
the time of matriculation. Only two ladies, Miss Karolina Widerstrém and Miss 
Hedda Andersson, have hitherto finished their medical studies and are practicing as 
physicians, but a considerable number of women are studying medicine. 
“The medical faculty in Stockholm (Karolinska institutet) is opened also to the 
ladies and follows the same rules for the examinations. 
“The studies for the medical degree in Sweden are by some people considered to 
take too long atime. Surely the expensive studies are a drawback to many women 
in choosing this profession. 
“The philosophical faculty is divided into a philological section and a mathe- 
matical-scientific. 
“The examinations within both these sections are (1) baccalaureate (= filosofie 
kandidat), requiring several compulsory subjects arranged in different groups, and 
(2) licentiate, a scientific examination comprising one principal subject and two sec- 
ondary ones. 
“A licentiate, after having written a scientific dissertation and successfully 
defended the contents of it against opponents, chosen by the university, is created 
‘doctor of philosophy,’ under ceremonies which have been in practice for hundreds 
of years, 
“The baccalaureate with certain compulsory subjects and followed by one year’s 
teaching at one of the State schools, qualifies for minor tutorship at these schools, 
The licentiate entitles to higher tutors’ appointments. 
“About 23 women have passedthe examination first mentioned, whereas the licen- 
tiate has hitherto only been passed by one woman, Miss Ellen Fries, who publicly 
defended her dissertation, and was created Ph. D. in 1883.  
-P-A-G-E-979
EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 921 
“Several women have studied at the philosophical faculty without passing any 
examination, some have later on applied themselves to scientific work. The latter 
is particularly the case with those having studied zoology and botany at the faculty 
of sciences of Stockholm. This faculty, founded in 1878, has, like the faculty of 
philosophy and philology of Gothenburg, founded in 1890, from the first opened its 
lecture halls to woman. Sonja Kovalevsky, a well-known Russian mathematician, 
was for some years attached as professor to the former. 
“The Swedish universities in Upsala and Lund—in spite of their old statutes, 
having no close colleges as is the case in England, for instance—present no difficulty 
to women for matriculating as university students. 
“With their male fellow-students they have partaken in public and private 
instruction, they have also entered as members of the province clubs, into which 
the students divide themselves, and of other societies existing at the universities.” 
In Sweden among the most noted of societies for women are the Frederika Bremer 
Torbundet, which is a center for all literary and educational questions, and the 
Gift Dvinnas Eganderratt, which presents the legal side of questions. Graduates 
from Swedish universities can hold a position in all higher schools, either for boys 
or girls. In commerce and medicine woman has many of the privileges accorded to 
man in the Scandinavian countries. (Reports from these societies.) 
GERMANY. 
The subject of the higher education of women in Germany is one of interest, but 
in the German-speaking countries there is less to be said in regard to that develop- 
ment than in some of the other countries of continental Europe. Dr. Wychgram,! 
director of the higher school for girls in Leipzig, says: 
“Higher educational institutions for girls in Prussia, as throughout Germany, are 
due to private initiative, and their earliest mention was at the close of the eight- 
eenth or the beginning of the nineteenth century. Established in parts of Germany 
then under French domination, they were taken in charge by the cities after the wars 
of 1813-1815. Differing greatly in the early part of the century, it is noticeable that 
after the formation of the German Empire (1871-1872*) these schools greatly devel- 
oped. In the autumn of 1872, through the efforts of Dr. Noeldeke, of Hanover, the 
general German Association for the Higher Education of Girls came into existence. 
The unification of schools for girls, with a similar basis for all Germany, was its main 
object. Baden, Wiirtemberg, Hesse, and Saxony gave official sanction to schools of 
a secondary grade, programmes were formulated, while in Prussia (in 1873) Dr. Falk, 
minister of ecclesiastical affairs, called together directors and directresses of girls’ 
schools to deliberate upon the question of the education of women. The main 
demand made by the convocation was that of a recognition of the necessity of girls’ 
schools of a higher grade. Owing to change of university and other causes, but 
little was accomplished, and the efforts were carried on but feebly until 1893, when 
the minister of public instruction announced general regulations for the higher edu- 
cation of young girls. These regulations were published in May, 1894, but they failed 
to recognize the girls’ schools as educational institutions of a secondary grade, thus 
failing to give them the governmental sanction and position accorded in France, 
Still they are placed under the supervision of provincial school authorities. Another 
disillusion to those working for this movement was that, on plea of looking after the 
health of girls, only a nine years course (instead of ten, as formerly) was accorded 
to these schools, but, as Dr. Wychgram naively remarked, ‘in that period the girls 
were expected to learn all the studies of a ten years course.’ At the close of the 
sixteenth year the girls may join complementary courses, if they so desire, in history, 
the history of literature and art, natural history, and foreign languages, or even 
other branches, if sanctioned by the director. Thus girls may prepare themselves

for careers. Care is taken not to overburden the girls with home studies during the 
school course, an average of from one to two hours’ work being all that is allowable 
at home.”

“This programme of study is worthy of praise,” says Dr. Wychgram; ‘the pro- 
fessor is left certain individualiv7 of action. The home language (German) is taught 
analytically; foreign terms, which have crept into the language, are proscribed; the 
richness of the German literature is clearly made manifest. Composition is taught 
in its highest form, and the best types of poetry and prose are placed before the 
pupils. The arithmetical study aims to render the pupils capable of rapid solving 
of problems which deal with matters of everyday life, domestic economy, savings, 
eare of one’s fortune, etc. The study of history deals with ancient history, and 
brings one to present conditions in the different civilized nations, nor is patriotism 
neglected. Geography is studied from the physical and political standpoints; nat- 
ural history includes the most important details pertaining to living things in their 
relation to man, also general hygienic rules; natural sciences include physics and 
chemistry, with special application to home life; the term manual training signifies 
more especially feminine handiwork, repairing, planning, and executing; also capa- 
bility of judging of material employed in such work. Gymnastic exercises cover 
freedom of movement, tight lacing being avoided, swimming, skating, plays if not 
too rough, and general exercises for strengthening the body. One special course of 
satisfaction to those interested in these higher educational movements for women is 
that women are to be employed as teachers in some one of the classes of the higher 
division, for heretofore male teachers have had the preference in school work, but 
this higher educational movement is calling out the latent energies of the women, 
and the authorities are permitting her to prepare for such position and giving exam- 
inations for the purpose of teaching in theso schools for girls.- In Prussia courses 
preparing for such positions have been established at Berlin and Géttingen; women 
follow the courses for two years, during which they have opportunities for practical 
exercises, and then are authorized to take the examinations for professorships in the 
higher classes of girls’ schools. The results of this plan are not yet proven, as the 
examinations take place in ayear and a half. These efforts are watched with much 
interest in a wide circle, and at a meeting held in Berlin on October 4, 1894, the 
director supervising the schools for girls and who is connected with the ministry of 
ecclesiastical affairs, and the president of the Association for the Higher Education 
of Women discussed the situation freely. Their general attitude seemed to favor 
the new regulations, but they earnestly advocated a ten years’ course (instead of 
nine) as requisite for the higher develepment of women, the optional complementary 
courses not being considered adequate for the purposes desired. They strongly urged 
the need of scientific training for women sanctioned by the Government, and also

the necessity of women as an adjunct to the director of these higher schools for 
girls. They also regret that the highest institutions for girls are not recognized 
and officially etioned by the Prussian authorities.” 3 
Tho progressive movements in connection with the higher education of women in 
Germany have been due in part to associations having the improvement of woman's 
condition in view. Attention was first directed to the many teachers and gover- 
nesses out of employ, to the status of seamstresses, to women connected with com- 
mercial pursuits. In the early sixties a woman teacher’s position in a Berlin school 
was vacant, and 114 wemen applied for the place. A monograph was presented in 
a meeting of the Central association for improving the working classes (Central- 
Verein fiir das Wohl der arbeitenden Classe), and as a result of the discussions the 
Lette-Verein was created, which in 1866 had 332 members and in 1883-1890 about 
1,100.!. The main object of the association was to aid women to carry on industrial 
work, but gradually different kinds of schools were established—such as indusirial 
and commercial schools, cookinggschools, those for the study of telegraphy, printing, 
domestic economy, modeling, ete. By degrees the success of the undertaking led to 
the establishment, under the auspices of the Lette-Verein, of schools giving a high 
gtade of study to women, such as would prepare them for examinations similar to 
those in the gymnasia for boys and for university examinations. Other associations 
were established with the object of ameliorating the condition of women, among 
them the Allgemeciner Deutscher Frauen-Verein, located in Leipzig, which has been 
in existence since 1865, and is conducted solely by women, in contradistinction to 
the Lette-Verein, which owed its inception and organization to men. The Allge- 
meiner Deutscher Frauen-Verein presented petitions to the governing bodies of 
Saxony requesting a better status for women teachers, and as early as 1872 the higher 
education of women was advocated, so that they might be fitted for university 
courses and forthe professions. In 1884 a fund was established which paid for two 
women students in medicine at Zurich University, and other amounts for higher 
study have been received since. The Franenbildungsreform-Verein, established in 
Weimar in 1888, has scientific study, parliamentary forms, and various phases of the 
we n question as object. Various petitions were sent to the governing bodies of 
the different German States between 1888 and 1891 requesting the creation of 
gymnasia for girls (Midchen-Gymnasia) so as to prepare for university studies. 
This association recognized the developments in secondary schools for girls—such as 
lycewms for girls (héhere Téchter-Schulen), etc., but its members desired the strict- 
ness of course and examinations found in the ‘ humanistische Gymnasia” for boys. 
On September 16, 1893, a Miidchen-Gymnasium was established in Carlsruhe, 
through the efforts of the Frauenbildungsreform-Verein, with similar instruction to 
that for boys. The girls must have finished their twelfth year, have had a six years 
course in girls’ higher school. The annual fees are 200 marks ($57.60). A similar 
gymnasium for girls was established in 1893 in Berlin, but it differs from that of 
Carlsruhe, as it requires graduation from the girls’ higher schools (héhere Téchter- 
schulen), so that only a three or four years course is required in the gymnasium. 
Tis object is to prepare women for university courses and for teachers in higher 
schools and academies, and to aid them in acquiring the scientific knowledge requis- 
ite for medical study. 
In Danzig in 1891 real courses for women (Realkursen fiir Frauen) were opened. 
Girl graduates of high schools, or those having equivalent knowledge, were to be 
admitted to these courses, which are both theoretical and practical and are intended 
for women who desire to follow university courses, to prepare for a profession or for 
the teaching fraternity. Similar ‘ Realkursen” were established in Berlin several 
years ago. The new gymnasia for girls and the real courses are due in the main to 
the different women’s associations. The Berlin Vereinigung zur Veranstaltung von 
Gymnasialkursen fiir Frauen states that graduates from the ‘‘Midchen-Gymnasia” 
     
    1 Deutsche Rundschau, Miirz 1896; Lexikon der Padagogik, von Ferdinand Sander.

  924 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
will be admitted to the philosophical and medical faculties of German universities. 
The plan of studies of Midchen-Gymnasia is modeled upon that of the gymnasia for 
boys and includes Greek, Latin, mathematics, German, English, French, philosophy, 
the natural sciences. The fees for this gymnasial study are between 200 and 250 
marks ($57.60 to $69.50), and with board for nonresident students, 1,200 to 2,000 
marks annually ($285 to $576). 
According to the “Bestimmungen iiber das Miidchenschulwesen die Lehrerinnen- 
bildung und Lehrerinnen-Priifungen vom Monat Mai 1894,” women teachers are to 
be required to pass more rigid examinations in future, but if proficient they are to 
be permitted to teach in one of the three upper classes in the girls’ higher schools and 
to be associate principals with men, instead of being relegated to secondary 
positions. 
These statements point to the fact that a reorganization of schools for girls is taking 
place in Germany; the new regulations of May 31, 1894, indicate important advance- 
ment in woman’s education. Formerly women were only admitted as teachers in 
elementary schools or lower grade secondary schools. According to these regula- 
tions every place connected with secondary schools is opened to them. A second 
examination, called ‘wissenschaftliche” or ‘“ Oberlehrerinnen-Priifung,” in two 
special subjects permits the undertaking of original work. The training is similar 
to that in German universities for men. The opportunities for German women in 
the universities have been few in number, although the Prussian minister of educa- 
tion has been memorialized frequently to give women the same privileges as men in 
the universities.! 
Among the different institutions for the higher education of women is the well- 
known Victoria Lyceum, in Berlin, which has lately celebrated its twenty-fifth 
anniversary. Established through the efforts of a Scotch lady, Miss Archer, of 
Edinburgh, it is under the patronage of the Empress Frederick. Commencing with 
about 100 students, it now has 1,400, who are pursuing a higher course of study, simi- 
lar to a university course. Lectures are given in philosophy and natural sciences, 
but the lyceum is not empowered to grant degrees. 
The different associations and the women engaged in special lines of work desired 
still other educational privileges, and in 1888, through the influence “of the Empress 
Frederick, a small sum of money was granted toward establishing advanced classes 
for teachers. These were to be on the lines of what is known as a university semi- 
nar. Each course was to occupy three years; the treatment to be thoroughly scien- 
tific and lead to independent work? from original authorities. At the end of the 
three years there was to be an examination, which it was hoped would win good 
posts in schools for the successful candidates. On these lines the examination was 
first held in 1891.”? 
Soon afterwards Géttingen opened courses of lectures, which were given by uni- 
versity professors, an attendance upon which required the passing of the teachers’ 
examination, with five years’ practice as teacher additional. 
To be prepared for entrance into the German universities the maturity exami- 
nation (Abiturienten examen) of the gymnasia is requisite. This is absolutely 
necessary in Prussia, but in some of the German States “the certificate of a Real- 
gymnasium suffices.”® Even if this examination has been passed, there are still 
obstacles to overcome before women can become regular students. In Berlin the 
professors are generally opposed to women students, but, ‘‘as a matter of fact, six 
women are attending lectures here”? (1895). At Géttingen “a few women, chiefly 
Americans and English, have attended single courses by special permission.””? 
“At Heidelberg women may attend lectures in the scientific-mathematical faculty,

class with no particular object in view.

but only as Zuhérerinnen and by permission of the professors concerned. They may 
also take the doctor’s degree in this faculty, and, in special instances, in the philo- 
sophical faculty, too, the condition in both cases being that the course of study lead- 
ing up to the degree must be pursued at Heidelberg. The permission to attend 
confers no right to do so, however, and it may be withdrawn arbitrarily and at any

“At Leipzig, as heretofore, women may attend, by permission, many of the courses 
of lectures, but they may not take a degree, and they are in no case ees as 
members of the university. ! 
“At Jena similar conditions prevail, only here the required permission is still more 
difficult to obtain, application having to be mad6, first, through the university Cura- 
tel, to the grand ducal patron of the institution, and after that, in second instance, 
to the professor himself. 
“ At Freiburg women may attend as guests, Hospitantinnen (which is only another 
word for Zuhérerinnen), the lectures in the philosophical and medical faculties.” * 
The attendance at medical lectures is not of great value to women students, 
beyond the discipline of study, until the State opens its medical examinations to 
them. 
On April 29, 1895, it was cabled from Germany that Miss Grace Chisholm, an Eng- 
lish woman, had just taken the degree in philosophy at the University of Géttingen, 
with the express permission of the Prussian minister of education. This is the first 
degree ever taken by a woman at Géttingen since it became a university. It is 
stated that the Emperor has heretofore opposed the admission of women to the uni- 
versities, and this is supposed to indicate a change of policy in regard to the higher 
education of women. 
It is also announced from Berlin that Dr. Bosse, the minister of public instruction, 
has just sanctioned the admission of the daughter of an ecclesiastic to the Abituri- 
enten examination at one of the Prussian gymnasiums. Minister Bosse’s decision 
overruled that of the provincial pedagogic board, which refused the application, so 
that this decision has an important bearing on the future status of the higher 
education of women in Prussia. 
AUSTRIA. 
In the Austro-Hungarian Empire somewhat similar conditions exist in regard to 
the education of women as have been described under Germany. 
Efforts are being made by those especially interested to give a higher grade of 
instruction to women desiring it. An article by Frau Johanna Leitenberger, author- 
ess and essayist, gives the general trend of educational movements: 
“The women’s movement in Austria has had two phases,’ the economic and the 
educational. * * * Institutions for the preparation of women for active employ- 
ments are continually appearing everywhere in Austria. In the front rank stands 
the Women’s Industrial Society (Frauen-Erwerb-Verein), which was founded at 
Vienna in 1866, and which has grown every year in usefulness and importance. In 
1874 the society opened its school for the industrial training of women, and work- 
shops, art studies, schools of design, etc., soon followed. A class in lace making is 
connected with the school, and the children of the poor laco makers of the Erzge- 
birge, of Bohemia, aro taught gratuitously. But the aim of the society ‘ is not sim- 
ply to train the hand; it would also develop the intelligence of its pupils. It has, 
therefore, established a commercial school, formed classes in the French and English 
languages, and during the winter season courses of lectures on various artistic and

scientific subjects are delivered under its auspices by competent professors and 
scholars; * -* * ae 
“Tf we now turn to the general education of women, we find that great progress 
has been made.during the past ten years, especially in Austria. Tho public and 
private schools for girls are infinitely improved. The establishment of girls’ 
lyceums (Lyceen), which aim at the higher and broader education of women and 
which cover almost the same ground as the boys’ gymnasiums, was a great step in 
advance, although they are far from meeting all the demands of the new era. 
Gratz has an excellent lyceum. * * * The normal schools for training female 
teachers are of a superior order in many of the Austrian cities. * _* * 
“The Society of Austrian Teachers and Governesses (Verein der Lehrerinnen und 
Erzieherinnen in Oesterreich), founded in 1870, takes care of the intellectual and 
material interests of its members. Its work may be classed under three heads: (1) 
Normal school and scientific instruction; (2) the spreading of rational ideas on 
female education; (3) the aiding of needy members. These objects are accom- 
plished by lectures and discussions on pedagogic and scientific themes, by the use cf 
alibrary and reading room, by participation in teachers’ mectings and congresses, 
by the publication of the proceedings of the society in the newspapers. * * * 
“Although the doors of our universities are closed to females,' we possess many 
women who have pursued their studies abroad and who ‘have acquired a reputation 
for their learning. Miss Rosa Welt, of Vienna, for example, is a graduate of Berne. 
During the summer semester of 1879 she attended the lectures on ophthalmy of Pro- 
fessor Mauthner, of Vienna, was admitted to the Rothschild hospital, directed by Dr. 
Oser, and was at one time mentioned as likely to become the assistant of Professor 
Pfliiger, of Berne, on diseases of the eye. The wife of Dr. Kerschbaumer, who has 
an institute at Salzburg for the cure of diseases of the eye, studied medicine at 
Vienna, became her husband’s assistant, and now aids him in all operations and 
sometimes performs them herself. The orientalist, Mrs. Camilla Ruzicka-Ostoic, 
who has spent six years at the Imperial Academy of Oriental Languages in Vienna, 
and has passed brilliant examinations in Turkish, Russian, and Arabic, received 
from the Emperor a gold medal for her dictionary of Turkish-German transcriptions, 
and from the King of Bavaria the Ludwig’s gold medal for art and science. In 1881 
she established at Vienna a private school for instruction in the Oriental tongues, 
and gave free courses of lectures to ladies on the Turkish language. . Miss Sofie von 
Torma has done some very good work recently in the investigation of antiquities at 
Siebenbiirgen. She has a book almost ready for publication in Trench and German, 
and has lectured on her discoveries. Prof. A. H. Sayce, of Oxford, and Dr. Schlic- 
mann have both spoken in high terms of Miss von Torma’s excavations. Miss Emilio 
Hérschelmann has lectured with success to women in Vienna on the history of art. 
Miss Amalie Thilo, principal of an important girls’ institute at the capital, is well 
known for her lectures on pedagogics, that on the great names in the history of edu- 
eation being specially worthy of mention. In 1881 Miss Helene Druskovich, Ph. D., 
spoke before a large audience under the auspices of a Viennese society, and showed 
alarge acquaintance with the Italian and other foreign literatures. Miss Susanna 
Rubinstein, Ph. D., has made a name both at home and abroad by her lectures and 
philosophical works. These are a few names selected from a long list of women who 
have proved that intellectual power is independent of her sex.” 
In Vienna modern movements in favor of the education of woman are indicated by 
the opening of a gymnasium, or secondary school for girls, through the efforts of tho 
Wiener Verein fiir erweiterte Fraucnbildung. This gymnasium, opened on October 
10, 1892, has as its object the moro thorough education of young girls in the higher 
educational branches. A similar society for the educational advancement of young 
women has been established lately in Budapest; its special aim, however, is to seo 
that preparatory training for the medical and philosophical faculties of the univer- 
sity is given to young women.

EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. O77 
The syllabus for 1895-96, sent out by the Wiener Verein zur Abhaltung akade- 
mischer Vortriige fiir Damen, indicates that this lecture course covers the field of 
science and literature quite thoroughly;.even the literary study of modern’ lan- 
guages is included. Most of the lecturers are “ Universitiits-Docenten,” but a 
well-known painter will read about the history of art, and two actors from the 
Hof-Theater will give instruction in elocution and recitation. 
Mme. Josephine Humpal-Zeman describes the attempts to benefit the women of 
Bohemia who, “like all Slavonic women, were always perfect helpmates of their 
‘stronger brothers,’ good mothers and housewives, always busy. Still they wero 
not deaf to the call of rising womanhood throughout the world, and in a compara- 
tively short time they have been able to produce more than 300 volumes of literature, 
besides numberless articles in various magazines and newspapers. They have started 
societies, the most prominent ones being those of the Red Cross, women’s industrial 
unions, literary societies, and the well-known American Club of Bohemian Ladies, 
of which Miss Dix speaks in her memoirs, and the most important of all—the 
Minerva—a society for the higher education of women. 
“This society, founded in 1891, sent a petition to the Emperor, asking him to open 
the doors of the celebrated University of Prague to women. The reply was that as 
soon as Bohemia shall have her young weihen prepared, this may be dene. Thon it 
was that the brave and gifted Elecua Eliska Krésnohorské began her heroic under- 
taking. At that time there were no gymmasia in Central Europe, and the Bohemian 
women had to begin in an entirely new and untrodden path. Again, as in the time 
of Huss, Bohemia was to light the torch, so that others could see their way to progress. 
“Headed by the editor of Lénsky Listy, Eliska Krésnohorska, the poetess—the 
Bohemian Mrs. Browning—the society, composed of the best women and men of 
Prague, entered quietly upon its great and noble mission, and in about two months 
enough money was secured to turn a private house into a woman’s gymnasium with 
53 earnest young women as students, a fine faculty, a library, and a laboratory. 
This took Prague by surprise. Even the most sarcastic foes stopped talking about 
the ‘long hair and short brains of women,’ and their unfitness for any serious work. 
Such was the beginning. With persevering effort the society gained friends and 
donations. The girls worked, as the first students of Vassar had to work, and at the 
close of the year they convinced the last doubter, by their high standing in physics 
and mathematics and by their brilliant recitals in Latin and Greek. That this first 
year had not exhausted ail the brave and knowledge-loving Bohemian girls, is proved 
by the fact that this year, the second year of the school, 30 new students applied for 
admission. Seven of the first-year students wish to enter the medical profession, 
and the Minerva again sent a request to the minister of education, asking that the 
students be permitted to enter the practice of pharmacy, and follow in the footsteps 
of their honored countrywoman, Dr. Anna Bayer !—the first woman in Europe to be 
appointed by the Austrian Government as state physician to Bosnia. 
“During all these efforts, the students of the University of Prague showed earnest 
sympathy with the movement, generously offering encouragement to their sisters. 
After this successful opening to the women of Bohemia, the women of Vienna, Hun- 
gary, and other countries in central Europe began to write to Prague for information 
and advice, thus learning from the so often overlooked and ignored Bohemian how 
to prepare the way to the well-guarded road of learning for the women of Austria 
and Germany.” 
To this statement it may be added that a gymnasium, or college preparatory 
school, was opened in Prague in 1890. Its pupils have asimilar course to that of 
the gymnasia for boys; the aim is to train for medical and academic departments of 
universities. A rigorous standard of scholarship is required, and so far the work 
is fully up to the standard. The first graduating class received its diplomas in 1894. 
It is also stated that the German University of Prague has granted women the 
privilege of attending the lectures as “‘ausserordentliche Zuhérer,” but this does net 
give them any academic status.

  928 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
In Hungary the ministry has issued a decree providing for the admission of prop- 
erly qualified women to the universities of Budapest and Klausenburg. The same 
decree authorizes the training of women for “the professions of teachers in female 
secondary schools, as druggists and as physicians for women and children.” a 
SWITZERLAND. 
As indications of the educational opportunities offered to the Swiss women, we 
quote the numbers of pupils and teachers reported under the Swiss school system, in 
the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1891-92. In the elementary 
schools in 1891 there were 232,978 girl pupils; in the advanced clementary, 12,191 
girls; in the continuation schools, 3,283 girls; in normal schools, 708 women; in the 
universities, 226 women students. The number of women teachers was 8,108 in the 
lowest grade, 192 in advanced elementary work, 70 in normal-school work. Noted 
by cantons, the per cent of women teachers was: Glarus, 0; Basel Land, 0.8; Appen- 
zelli. R.,1; Thurgau, 2.7; St. Gall, 3.4; Solothurn, 4.5; Zurich and Schaffhausen, 
each, 8.4; Graubiinden, 12.2; Aargau, 13.5; Lucerne, 13.8; Baselstadt, 28.6; Appen- 
zelli. R., 29.2; Vaud, 37.6; Berne, 38.6; Freiburg, 39.7; Wallis, 45.4; Zug, 49.2; Uri, 
50; Schwytz, 55; Geneva, 56.3; Tessin, 59.5; Neuenburg, 65.3; Nidwalden, 72.2; 
Obwalden, 73.7. Average in 1881 was 30.2, which was increased in 1891 to 33.3 per 
cent, although women teachers are no longer employed in the cantons of Appenzell 
i. R. and Schaffhausen. 
‘The universities have been opened to women for the last twenty years. Zurich, 
Geneva, Berne, Neufchiitel, and lastly Basel, have one by one decided to give women 
the desired privileges. In 1894 the University of Geneva had 186 women in its 
courses, from Russia, Poland, France, Holland, America, Servia, and Armenia. 
Basel at first refused to admit women, but has now yielded to pressure, and allows 
women to matriculate regularly, but only as a matter of experiment. It is stipu- 
Jated that, if the experiment does not work well, the university will again be closed 
to that sex. 
According to statements made by Miss Marie Goegg (in the Woman Question in 
Europe, by Theo. Stanton) a petition was sent in October, 1872, to the “council of 
Geneva, asking that women be admitted to the University of Geneva on the same 
footing as men. * * * The following table gives the number of female stu- 
dents who have pursued their studies at the Geneva University:    
Letters. | Total. Year. Sciences. | Medicine. 
  
    
“This table shows that the number of students is steadily increasing.! The list, 
of female graduates up to December 31, 1882, gives 9 bachelors of science, physical 
and natural, and 1 doctor of medicine. In Germanic Switzerland, at Zurich, for 
example, the number of female students is much larger than in the universities of 
Romanic Switzerland, and they are for the most part Russians. The admission of 
women to the University of Neufchitel dates from 1878, but few have profited by 
the concession. Fifteen ladies, nonmatriculates, have listened to a course of lectures 
on general history and the history of modern literature, and 1 female student has 
  
1But still more interesting is the fact that, with one single exception, all of the female students 
have pursued scientific or medical studies rather than those of a literary nature.

EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 929 
matriculated, but up to the present time (May, 1883) no degree has been conferred 
on a woman.” 
It is generally conceded that the greater proportion of women who have studied 
at Swiss universities are Russians, hence an account of the experience of these ladies 
in their efforts to obtain the highest grade education, denied them in their own land, 
will be of interest. We quote from Russian Women in Swiss Universities,! by Louise 
Nydegger, who says: 
“While Germany is ‘still obstinately refusing women admission to her colleges, 
the Swiss universities have for a number of years received them on the same terms 
as men, and conferred upon them the same degrees. In the university laws and 
regulations there is no distinction made between male and female students. Both 
sexes assume the same obligations and receive the same rights on matriculating. 
Nearly two years ago this equality was extended a step further, when a woman was 
received as privat-docent in the faculty of law at the University of Zurich, which, 
in Europe, is a very remarkable position for a woman. The question of granting 
such a right to women was vigorously debated, not only by the faculties of two uni- 
versities, but in the Federal Council of the Swiss Republic, until Dr. Emilie Kempin 
was finally received, on her application, into the body of university instructors. In 
March, 1892, she opened her course of lectures with a large attendance. * *. * It 
is a strange fact that even in Switzerland, where the same educational advantages 
are extended to both sexes, higher education for women, parallel with that for men, 
is not viewed at all favorably. If a young girl is to continue her education beyond 
what she gets at the secondary school, which she leaves at the age of 15 or 16, she 
is sent to some female institute. There she gets courses supposed to be especially 
* adapted to the feminine mind and needs, consisting chiefl anguages, 
literature, history, and music, and there generally her education termin Indeed, 
public opinion is so strong that there are very few Swiss women as regular students 
in the universities. Perhaps the same men who sit in the Federal Council and help 
to keep the universities open to women would discourage, if not decidedly oppose, 
their daughters or sisters éntering. Still, there are every year a fair number of 
women students matriculated in the three principal universities of Switzerland, 
at Berne, Zurich, and Geneva. Women of other countries come a long distance to 
ayail themselves of the opportunities which Swiss women neglect at their own 
doors. In Berne there are at present two or three women from the interior of Sibe- 
ria, who were six weeks in traveling from their homes. Among those from a great 
distance, there is one from Australia, one from Madagascar, and one from a colony 
of southern Africa. The total number of students in Berne has been something over 
600 in the last few years, and about 80 of these are women. In Geneva there is very 
nearly the same proportion. The majority of these women are from various prov- 
inces of Russia and most of them are Israelites. * * * There a few Bulgarian, 
German, and English women. Those of other nationalities are so rare that they 
scarcely count. * * * Russian women have gone the furthest in emancipation, 
have acquired the most brilliant reputation in matters of intellect, and are most 
daring in enterprise, as compared with those of other nations. American women 
may have accomplished more, but they do not labor under the same difficulties as 
the Russians. * * * As the Russians are by far the most numerous among the 
women students, women’s standings and doings are measured according to them. 
But perhaps no class of beings has been more misrepresented than Russian women 
students; first, by the enemies of women’s higher education; secondly, by those who 
do not understand their foreign ways and character and who judge them by their 
own limited standard. Both parties have united in overlooking their merits and in 
exaggerating their faults, or even in attributing to them such as they never had. 
They succeeded in so misrepresenting the character and conduct of the Russian 
women as students that they created a strong prejudice against them, which harmed

930 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
the cause of women’s higher education more than any sound argument that could 
be advanced. Indeed, in order to understand these students, it is not enough to 
stand by and watch them, for it is true that they often may give cause for misappre- 
hension. One has to be in the midst of them and live with them in order to know 
them. 
“To one who does not regard them from the outset with a shallow prejudice above 
which he can not rise, they are interesting enough, as he observes them on the 
streets or in the university rooms and halls, conversing and gesticulating in their 
animated way. One not understanding their language might often think them 
quarreling when they aro merely expressing their opinions on entirely impersonal 
questions. Most of them wear their hair short, and are quite indifferent in matters 
of dress. This has been made a severe reproach against them by those who devote 
more time and attention to their persons and less to their minds. But a still greater 
accusation made against them is their freedom in mingling with men. In Switzer- 
land, the sexes have very few common interests, and few opportunities are granted 
them for associating before marriage. They live so much apart that as a rule they 
are embarrassed and awkward in each other’s presence, and one almost wonders 
how they get to know cach other before they are married, or at least engaged. 
“But the Russians are raised differently, there being among them much more fel- 
lowship between men and women. <Accustomed to regard cach other as comrades 
and coworkers, they treat each other accordingly, in relations where there is no love 
concerned beyond the love every human being owes to his neighbor. Intellectual 
pursuits, especially, can create between men and women relations into which love 
does not necessarily entor. As there are also a number of Russian male students at 
the university, the two sexes naturally preserve the same bearing toward each * 
other. Thus, while two young Swiss of opposite sexes can scarcely take a walk or 
attend an entertainment together unless they are engaged, the Russians think noth- 
ing of going to each other’s rooms for study, of walking together at any time ef the 
day or evening, even until late, or of assisting each other in various ways. This 
freedom, so natural and hence so allowable, has given tise to the gravest misinter- 
pretations on the part of those who are accustomed to an artificial system of inter- 
course, and who have deeply rooted in them its notions of @ecorum, On this 
account, it has even been seriously argued that the mixed attendance of men and 
women at the universities leads to immorality. To mako appearances worse, most 
of the women study medicine, and are with the men not only in the lecture rooms, 
but in the anatomy classes, in the hospitals—in fact, everywhere. It may be true 
that many things come up which are painful for a young woman when she has to 
face them in the presence of men; but science calls for the greatest objectivity, and 
a woman who is earnestly devoted to her work will soon acquire it. Does it lower 
a woman's dignity if, for the purpose of some day relieving pain, she rises above 
the idea of sex and remains calm in situations where otherwise she would be over- 
whelmed with shame? She is no more unwomanly for doing this than a man is 
unmanly under the same circumstances. 
“The Russian women are animated and excitable in temperament. Each of the 
three university cities named above has quarters where a large number of the 
Russians live near each other. Generally they rent rooms and prepare breakfast and 
supper themselves on an alcohol lamp, taking their dinners at some boarding place. 
They communicate little with those outside of their own nationality, This is due 
not so much to exclusiveness as to lack of opportunity for contact with others, and, 
to some extent, to the language. Itis not hard to make their acquaintance if any 
one seeks it, for they are cordially sociable and very hospitable. A cup of tea, which 
they prepare deliciously with the addition of a slice of lemon or some other fruit, 
is offered you at any time of the day when you may enter their room, and you are 
soon set at ease by their frank way of treating you. 
“Of those that come to the universities of Berne and Zurich, almost all have at 
least a theoretical knowledge of German when they arrive, so that they can very 
   
-P-A-G-E-989
EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 931 
nearly understand the lectures, though they may not yet be able to speak well. 
Often they understand, read and write the language much better than they can 
speak it, for want of practice, because they always converse in Russian among 
themselves and have little opportunity for conversation in another language. Some 
can speak fluently when they arrive, having studied German from childhood. It is 
the same with the French in Geneva, only a larger number know this language at 
the outset, it being more popular in Russia than German. 
“Of course, the difficulties of university study in a foreign country are much 
increased for those who come with little or no knowledge of the language, but there 
are afew such. However, the Russians have great facility in learning languages, 
and are very good at conversation. Even before they have quite mastered a lan- 
guage they can express their thoughts remarkably well, aptly steering around the 
terms with which they are not yet familiar. To this ability to express themselves 
is added that other, so essential to good conversation, that of calling forth the 
thoughts of others. They talk with a certain animation and candor that makes 
them very genial. There is scarcely a subject of general interest that one can not 
discuss with them, but they are interested especially in the social questions of the 
day. It is natural that their attention should be turned to such questions, consider- 
ing the social conflicts and wrongs which agitate their own country and from which 
so many suffer. Bellamy’s Looking Backward, for instance, is a book that was 
eagerly read by them at one time. 
“Tt is remarkable, too, how much they have read, even before coming to the uni- 
versity. The Russian girl of the better classes grows up doing scarcely anything 
about the house, for servants are very cheap and plentiful in Russia, and manual 
labor is despised. Thus she has the whole day to herself, and the intelligent spend 
it in reading and study. Even part of the night is spent in this manner, they are 
such insatiable readers, From a very early age they read enormously and indis- 
criminately, science, history, novels, poetry—everything which falls into their 
hands..7%.*-* 
“The ideal of the intellectual young girl is to go to a foreign university, where 
she can study in a freer atmosphere and have more advantages. To this may be 
added a desire to see the world, to enjoy life, and to be perfectly independent. She 
has visions of happiness and activity to be found far away, which sometimes end in 
disappointment, for even there other difficulties come up which do not enter into 
her dreams. Often she has to struggle long and hard with parents and relatives 
before they grant her wish, because, being less enthusiastic, they take more account 
of the danger and responsibility of such astep. * * * But she is determined in 
her purpose, and at last sbe gains the victory. Often she leaves home before the 
age of 20; but, as a result of her eager and varied reading, her mind has matured 
early. At that age there is scarcely anything of note which she has not read. 
Besides Russian literature, she has read the chief works of the principal foreign 
languages, either in the original or in translations. She has a good memory for 
what pleases her. Some can recite long passages, not only of such writers as Ler- 
montoff, who is a favorite among Russian youth, but also of Shakespeare, Schiller, 
Goethe, and others. Even long after having read anything they can give a clear 
outline of it, which shows that they read with understanding as well as with 
rapidity. Marvels of intelligence and precocity are not infrequent among them. 
“In Berne there is a young woman from Odessa in the law school, the only female 
law student there until last term. She left home very young. As she had musical 
gifts, she was sent to a conservatory in Vienna. She stayed there nearly a year, but 
music alone did not satisfy her, and she begged her parents to let her go to the uni- 
versity. She entered the school of medicine in Berne, and after a year’s study found 
again that it was not what she wanted. She then changed to the law school, in 
which—the studies being congenial to her—she persevered, Last year she won a 
prize in competition with her fellow-students by a dissertation on a given subject; 
and this was awarded her for real merit, not through gallantry. Gallantry is not

932 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
carried so far in Europe when woman competes with man. In the discussions of 
the class room she is also remarkable for her quickness and ability. As one of the 
other students said, ‘She speaks long before we are ready to say anything.’ Some 
time next winter she will take her examinations for the doctor’s degree; and 
she was only 22 last month. In addition, she plays well on the piano, and has 
much knowledge outside her special line of study. She is a vivacious little thing, 
very nervous, with delicate, intellectual features. When she becomes animated 
and absorbed in discussion, destruction to everything she takes in her hand just 
then. 
“ About two years ago another young woman passed a brilliant examination for 
the degree of M. D. at the age of 22; and at the Swiss universities the study of 
medicine requires at least five years’ study, besides a good preparation before 
beginning. 
“Many of the Russian students come to the university with slender means. The 
last few years especially have been hard for them, for the ruble, whose nominal 
value is 4 francs, was actually not worth more than 2.30 to 2.60 francs in foreign 
countries. Buta characteristic trait of the Russian students is their generosity 
and helpfulness toward each other. There is among them a treasury to which 
those who have abundance contribute for their less fortunate compatriots, Then, 
during each semester, there are ‘evenings’ given, the profits of which are also 
used to aid poor students. These ‘evenings’ are held in the hall of some hotel or 
restaurant, and tickets of admission are sold. There are no waiters; the students 
prepare and serve the refreshments themselves. Tea is the principal beverage, and 
the famous ‘samovars’ stand on sidetables. * * * 
“As the attendance on these occasions consists of students and their friends, the 
‘evening’ becomes a gathering for social enjoyment. They are delightful diver- 
sions from the work of the semester, and everyone seems to be gay and happy. To 
increase both amusement and profit, there is a table with trifles for which lottery 
tickets are sold. There are tables with fruits and candies and all sorts of sweet 
things to tempt buyers. When the attendance is thought to be nearly complete, 
the talk and laughter is hushed for a while and everybody’s attention is turned to 
the stage. A little drama, recitations, or tableaux are given. Later, dancing is 
begun and occupies the rest of the evening. According to traditional notions of 
womanliness, the women medical students are now ‘womanly,’ for they have laid 
aside dissecting knives and text-books, and enjoy themselves in the ballroom just 
like society women. * * * 
“The more bold and active among them take a keen interest in the workingmen’s 
movements of the city in which they study, attending their meetings and enter- 
tainments. There is often a close sympathy between the Russian students and the 
working classes. * * * 
“Another organization among the Russian students of both sexes is that connected 
with a library and reading room which they support by monthly contributions. 
When quarrels arise they even have a sort of tribunal to settle matters. Sometimes 
a punishment is inflicted, i. e., that thereafter none of the students shall speak to 
the culprit. Thus, outside the university they lead a life of their own, apart from 
the rest of the students. 
“Téis touching to see how some of them endure privations for the love of study, or 
for the sake of living with more freedom in a foreign country, or for both reasons 
combined. Such students live in a small, simple room, preparing their own meals 
on an alcohol lamp, and of course their food is very plain, consisting of little but 
porridges, bread, and tea. But, even under such circumstances, they do not forget 
to be hospitable, and would share the last morsel with any fellow-creature whom 
they considered as a guest. Indeed, they often are each other’s guests, and the idea 
of wealth or poverty does not seem to enter into their relations. In the same way, 
-hey are free about lending and borrowing money, which they usually receive in

monthly sums. Those who have money give as long as they have any, and when it 
is gone they borrow in their turn until they are again supplied. 
“The study of medicine is a long and hard study, and those Russian women who 
pursue it, even under difficulties, have little assurance that it will ever gain them a 
living. For this reason it seems strange at first that the majority devote themselves 
to it, while only a few follow other courses, such as natural science or literature. 
But medicine affords them more chances of activity than studies in another direction, 
even though women are not allowed to practice it in Rus They practice in a sort 
of underhand way, as assistants to some masculine relative or friend who is a doctor. 
But they have no right to give prescriptions, and, of course, more or less danger is 
always connected with work of this kind. Some go to Bulgaria, Servia, or Rou- 
mania, where the law allows women to practice; and a few settle in Switzerland. 
But in this latter country it is hard for them to acquire a practice unless they have 
influential connections among the professors; first, because there are plenty of good 
native doctors, and secondly, because the prejudice against feminine doctors is still 
strong. 
“Others go to America, allured by glowing reports of woman’s position there, of 
unbounded freedom and lucrative work. The destiny of these differs widely. Some 
may be fortunate in the New World, while of others rumors have floated back to 
their friends in the Old World that in spite of university diplomas and doctors’ 
degrees, they were obliged to work in factories. The latter-is quite probable; for, 
coming here without friends or protection, strang to the country and its ways, 
they fail to obtain the position for which they are qualified, and at last are forced to 
resort to manual labor. Perhaps Americans do not extend to them une sympathy 
which they merit, receiving them coldly and even with dist 
“A good many, especially of the wealthier class, study ve of 
study, without expecting to apply their knowledge. They study medicine because 
it is the most positive science there is at present, and seems best adapted to their 
bent of mind. However, that does not hinder them from acquiring much knowledge 
in other directions. It is even remarkable how they adhere to the study of medi- 
cine, in spite of other qualifications more promising. In Geneva there is a young 
woman from Odessa, now studying medicine for the third year, who has a voice of 
rare beauty, and who is very g: ful and prepossessing. She has often been urged, 
by persons highly capable of judging in such matters, to cultivate her rare gift, as 
it would be a sure way to fame and fortune. But no prospect, however flattering, 
ean induce her to abandon the study of medicine, which she pursues with the inten- 
tion of some day devoting herself to philanthropic work. Of course she does not 
entirely neglect her voice, and sometimes contributes to the entertainment on those 
‘evenings’ mentioned before, or sings at smaller gatherings of her friends. 
“As arule, the Russian student has a great capacity for work. When preparing 
for an important examination, for instance, she stays shut up in her room, lounging 
half dressed upon a sofa and studying fordays together. Her friends, knowing how 
she is occupied, visit her but little, unless to study with her. This she can keep up 
week after week for a longtime. But, ordinarily, they believe in having enjoyment, 
too, in their college life, and they have many gay times, visiting each other, enter- 
taining company in their rooms and drinking tea together, or frequenting the thea- 
ter. Sociability is highly developed in them. As they are usually lovers of nature, 
and the university cities of Switzerland have such beautiful surroundings, long 
walks and rambles are another source of pleasure and recreation. But those who 
come to the university simply for the sake of leading a freer life and having more 
enjoyment than they could at home, and who do not work seriously, are rare, though 
occasionally such can be found. 
“Often they study after they are married, and sometimes husband and wife are 
both in the university. Among the married women, two must be mentioned, 
although they are not students Seca tor the sake of the support which ee 
have been to their student husbands.

  934 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
“Recently a gentleman passed his examination for the M. D. degree at the Univer- 
sity of Berne who had been an exile in Siberia for several years. When sentenced 
he was engaged, and his betrothed followed him voluntarily into exile, where she 
was married and faithfully shared his hardships. When he was free again they 
went to Berne, where he entered the university. Their means being insufiicient, 
the wife returned to Russia as a governess, A few months before his examinations 
she came back to Berne to help him in another way. While he stayed at home all 
day studying and reviewing, his wife got their notebooks from other students and 
copied the lectures which he was missing, besides copying the thesis which he had 
to write for his degree. 
“The wife of the second gentleman has two small children, and can not go away 
to work, but nevertheless she largely supports the family while her husband studies. 
From 20 to 30 Russian students get their dinners from her everyday, and she does 
all the work alone—even sews and mends for some of them, besides having tho care 
of the two children. There are few comforts in her home, it being in a somber gar- 
ret story, yet she is not one of those women who are always complaining of being 
tired and worn out. She is always bright and cheerful, though often she does look 
worn. 
“ Pessimistic tendencies are common among the Russian students, and this seems 
inevitable in their conditions. * * * The more intelligent anyone is the more 
acutely he suffers in such a life, especially when he feels the impossibility of doing 
anything to change it. With an active mind and an intense desire for knowledge, 
the intellectual Russian girl has a constant longing, which impels her to go to a for- 
eign university in the hope of satisfying it there. She spends years of study abroad, 
enjoying the free atmosphere of the Swiss Republic as well as its natural beauties, 
and moving in a circle of congenial compatriots. Still there is in her, like an under 
current to a gayer temperament, a strain of melancholy which sometimes gains the 
upper hand. When her university career is over, the chances of a congenial activity 
to follow it are few. In Russia she is limited to the domestic sphere. * * * To 
remain for the rest of her life in a foreign country would be hard, too, in many 
respects, even aside from the fact that it often means separation from her parents. 
Thus, the longing with which many come is still unappeased, or even more intense, 
when they leave the university with a degree, unless it be terminated in happy mar-

GREECE, 
“Since 1890 the university at Athens has been opened to women; until that date 
women who desired a higher education were obliged to go to the universities of 
Europe, because they could not obtain this higher instruction in Greece.” 
This statement would seem to imply that the women of Greece had not previously 
received a high degree of education, and in a measure this is true; but, dating no 
farther back than 1836, it is stated that an educational society was formed with the 
object of educating the women of Greece. Through the efforts of this seciety, and 
“with the generous help of M. Apostolos Arsakes, an Epirote Greek, the Arsakeion! 
“was built. It has now 1,500 pupils and a capital of 1,300,000 drachmas (4250,000), 
and has yearly subventions from the Government and local governments. The 
pupils, many of whom become schoolmistresses, are supposed to spend six years in 
it after having spent three in elementary schools. There is an infant school under 
the same management. There is a similar school for girls at Kerkyra, founded in 
1868, with over 200 pupils, as well as at Eleusis, Gaurion, Kotachovon, and Menidi. 
The society has in its service altogether 40 professors and 59 schoolmistresses. 
From 1836 to 1890, 43,963 pupils have passed through these schools, of whom 2,500

haye become teachers. The number of pupils of the Arsakeion has been in different 
years as follows:

« * * * The amount of money spent on the Kerkyra school has been 1,108,379 
drachmas ($213,957), which is included in the above total. Its total pupils number 
4,648. Over 3,000 girls have passed through the other four schools, which have been 
founded nearly thirty years. Two hundred and fifty of the poorer girls receive this 
higher education without payment. The expenditure on the six schools in 1889 was 
327,044 drachmas ($63,119). There are a good many private schoois for girls in Athens. 
The result of all this effort is that Greek women get a very fair education, and can 
get avery good one. The girls, however, do not make anything like the use of the 
schools that the boys do, chiefly through parental dislike to trust them out of sight, 
a prejudice which is not yet entirely unreasonable, though it is no doubt a legacy 
from Turkish times. This is gradually being overcome, and then no doubt the girls 
will be allowed to take advantage, to the full, of the ample opportunities offered to 
them.” 
In elementary schools in 1889 there were 18,986 girls pursuing the course of study 
(boys 78,815). 
Another writer! gives an interesting description of the Arsakeion, and of the 
Ouvroir des Femmes Pauvres (half factory, half school). We quote: 
“There are two fine institutions which do much to further the interests of women 
in the famous Grecian capital. It is so natural to associate Athens with a past 
glory, and therefore with retrogression, that it is a surprise to meet with modern 
institutions of such excellence as the Arsakeion and the Ouvroir des Femmes 
Pauvres. The former is an unusual and most successful combination of a boarding 
school, private day school, and high school on an extraordinarily large scale; for the 
scholars, all told, number nearly seventeen hundred. The needs of so vast an 
undertaking are amply filled by the spacious building which was founded by a 
generous Greek in 1836, and has since been largely supported by donations, the 
boarders paying but 100 and the day scholars 35 francs a month. An air of neatness 
and order pervades the whole structure, which is of stone, with bare, austere walls, 
In that part of the building frequented by the day scholars, and which is at the 
samo time the home of a large number of girls, is a pretty chapel, a good library, a 
room full of scientific instruments, another where courses in dressmaking take 
place, and a wing which answers the purpose of a school for music, both vocal and 
instrumental. Drawing and painting are poorly taught, no freehand work being 
required. Although the curriculum includes the study of the French language, all 
the lectures and lessons on the sciences, history, and literature are given in the soft 
and melodious Greek, to which it is a pleasure to listen, even without understanding 
what is said. 
“The scholars, who belong exclusively to the middle class, are orderly and atten- 
tive pupils, but unprepossessing in appearance. There are few bright and fewer 
pretty faces to be seen; the almost entire absence of blondes is most striking, and 
the cast of features is decidedly Jewish in character. The unhealthy, sallow com- 
plexions are no doubt in part due to the fact that the windows in all the class rooms

are kept hermetically sealed. In the dormitories, however, which accommodate 
from 15 to 30 girls, the windows are left open all day. These lofty rooms are even 
barer than hospital wards, for there is not so much as a chair to be seen. 
“4 short distance from the great Acropolis, and almost opposite the mighty pil- 
lars of the Jupiter Temple, stands a modest-looking building, which gives employ- 
ment to and thereby saves from want 400 women and girls. The Ouvroir des 
Femmes Pauvres—half factory, half school as well—has existed for twenty years. 
It was first organized and has since been managed and directed wholly by women. 
Itis a charity only, inasmuch as it furnishes so many poor and ignorant women with 
the means of learning how to gain a livelihood, and the opportunity of doing so as 
soon as ‘this has become possible; for the various useful and ornamental things 
manufactured in the building find a large sale. 
“The visitor is first ushered into the sales and éxhibition department, which is 
very like those of the American Women’s exchanges, and presided over by ladies 
who are indefatigable in showing the different articles and explaining how they are 
made. There are rugs and carpets indestructible, but hideous; characteristic many- 
colored Greek table covers; pretty silk goods, both plain and fancy; silk and cotton 
crepes; muslins, with silk stripes; soft scarfs of exquisite shades; gauzy handker- 
chiefs, with borders equally delicate in color, and with ‘Athens’ embroidered in 
Greek letters in the corner; embroideries of all kinds, and a very large display of 
most beautiful underwear. These daintily stitched and embroidered garments, with 
their pretty ribbons and laces, have a truly Parisian air and are much in demand 
for trousseaux, 
“The other rooms on the ground floor are given up to the manufacture of mate- 
rials, which are spun and woven with incredible rapidity and skill by young and 
old. Hand and treadle machines are used throughout, except in the room where 
bright silks for the fabrics are spooled by machinery. On the upper floor, more 
goods are manufactured; but the chief industry is the cutting and making of 
underwear. 
“Small children are taught how to hem and tuck in one room, older little ones 
embroider the initials on the handkerchiefs, while the girls who have become 
skilled workwomen make whole garments under the supervision of one or two 
teachers.and matrons. Then there are rooms where the carpets and table covers 
are made, 12-year old girls and old women working side by side, as in the other 
manufacturing departments. The countenances of all the workers verify the asser- 
tion of the principals that they are not only industrious, but thoroughly good women 
and girls. However busily at work, they always find time to greet the stranger 
with a friendly smile or nod; and although they are all of the lower class, the girls 
are brighter looking and more comely than the pupils of the Arsakeion. Indeed, 
there are some strikingly beautiful faces with classic features, and coloring as dark 
and rich as that of the Italian maidens. There are one or two little boys among the 
workers, who exhibit their handiwork with much pride. Work begins at 8 and 
continues until noon, when a simple but hearty dinner of soup, meat, and vegetables 
is to be had for the trifling sum of 15 centimes, after which work goes on again till5. 
The wages vary according to the amount and quality of the labor, but the highest 
do not exceed 5 drachmas, which is less than half a dollar, owing to the depreciation 
of paper money. Fortunately, the cost of living in Greece is correspondingly low.” 
Mme. Callirrhoe Paren, editor of the Ephemeris ton Kyrion, of Athens, reviews the 
situation in Greece by stating that— 
“The admission of woman to the university and to the Polytechnic, the extension 
in wider circles of her industrial activity, her eligibility to membership in the 
examining committees of the public schools and in the examination of teachers for 
diplomas, the preparation already made by a progressive government for her tech- 
nical and special education, the diffusion of her philanthropic activity gradually 
through the country, the establishment of schools on Sunday for the secular education 
of girls and women who are employed during the week, are victories for which we

may raise trophies upon the thorny road we have traveled, so that we may go for- 
ward with courage in the companionship of all those truly desiring and laboring for 
domestic and social prosperity.” ! 
ITALY. 
No law of the Kingdom forbids women entering the universities and taking degrees, 
and within a few years several women have reached the doctorate in medicine and 
literature. Viewed from the historical standpoint, Italian women distinguished 
themselves in poetry and prose even prior to the Renaissance, and during that period 
they held positions as professors in the universities of Italy. 
In the fourteenth century La Donna Abella, a woman physician, had quite an hon- 
ored reputation, and in later centuries there were women professors of sciences and 
the classics; among them Bettina Gazzadini, a most distinguished savant; Laura 
Bassi Veratti, lecturer in philosophy at Bologna; Gaetana Agnesi, Clotilde Tam- 
broni, celebrated for Greek improvisation; the beautiful Novella d’Andrea, and 
Laura Cereta-Lerina, who was professor of metaphysics and mathematics in Brescia; 
Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia, of Venice (1646-1684), who became doctor in phi- 
losophy in 1678.2. These and many other learned women are grouped. ee in the 
annals of the Italy of past centuries. 
In the sixteenth century, ‘‘so rich in illustrious women,”* there was scarcely an 
important city without its poetess; the intellectual women disappeared with the 
fall of the Italian republics, but from that epoch ‘dates the creating of various 
religious orders for the education of girls.”4 As early as 1779 an institution for girls 
(Edueatorio femminile Maria-Delaide) was founded in Palermo. The professional 
instruction of women was first advocated by Laura Mantegazza, who founded the 
earliest professional school in Milan, with the object of giving girls such instruction 
in industries as would lead to independence if united to higher moral and intellec- 
tual education. When Napoleon I was in control in northern Italy a girls’ college 
(Collegio reale di fanciulle) was established in Milan. From 1822 to 1830 the Aus- 
trian Government, then dominating, organized 14 intermediate and 1,044 elementary 
schools for girls. The Casati law of 1859 placed elementary schools for girls in 
charge of women teachers, and decreed the establishment of normal schools to pre- 
pare for such work. In 1861 a girls’ college of high grade was established in Milan 
and one in Turin in 1866. A higher normal school for women in Florence dates 
from 1882.° At a later date it is stated that the higher educational institutions for 
girls and the ‘“‘ magisteria,” or special normal schools, “answer the purpose of gen- 
eral culture for women rather than that of normal training, for which they were 
created.”® The same writer states that “the culture of Italian women, as noted 
in the attendance at the normal schools, has progressed everywhere. The pedagogic 
direction of the kindergarten, of the Sunday schools, as well as of the inferior classes 
of the elementary schools, is now intrusted to female teachers. A group of distin- 
guished and well-educated women, known in literature, have undertaken, by means 
of lectures and the press, to secure such a law as will afford women the same treat- 
ment as is accorded to male pupils.” 
Signor Bodio, director of the Royal Statistical Bureau in Rome, says: ‘‘ Women 
are admitted to both classical and technical schools; in 1891 there were 1,498 women 
in attendance. There are also technical schools for women exclusively. Women 
are admitted to university privileges, and are most frequently to be found in attend- 
ance upon the faculties of natural sciences and of medicine and surgery. Among 
the women who frequent the institutes of a higher grade than secondary schools the

majority attend special courses of study, but do not endeavor to obtain academic 
degrees.”! 
While the number of women students in all grades of schools, especially those of 
the highest grade, can not be definitely stated, it is of interest to know that there 
wero 15,894 women studying in normal schools in 1891-92; in evening and holiday 
schools, 64,379; in private schools, 124,733; in the public elementary schools, 1,033,547 ; 
while the rudiments of instruction were given in the same year to 142,928 girls in 
kindergarten and infant schools. Connected with the convitti, or boarding depart- 
ments of schools, were 49,726 women, of whom 3,539 were engaged in special studies.” 
In the 5 institutes for instruction in music which receive Government subsidies 
there were 305 women students out of a grand total of 870. In some of the normal 
schools the elements of agricultural science are taught, and in 1890-91 there were 
women under instruction in11 normal schools. Studying for the position of instruct- 
ress in normal schools, or in schools above the elementary grades, were 181 women 
in 1890-91. The course of study covered Italian language and literature, French, 
German, and English languages, history, geography, mathematics, physics and 
chemistry, logic, psychology, hygiene, and drawing.’ 
In contradistinction to the statements herewith presented, an interesting article 
on the education of Italian girls is cited in part. It is from the Signora Zampini- 
Salazar, who was one of the Italian ladies at the Woman’s congress in Chicago in 
1893: 
“As regards a desire for knowledge among Italian women, it is reduced to the 
smallest proportions. Those inthe lowest station of life have become the only class 
who study at all, and these mostly obtain positions as teachers. Of all classes prob- 
ably the country girls make the best wives and mothers, and become devoted to their 
families when not led away by an imprudent ambition to seek their fortunes, and too 
often to find their loss, in the great centers of industry. Few efforts are made to 
establish local schools of technical instruction in these villages and rural communi- 
ties. Prof. Ruggero Bonghi has lately succeeded in establishing a first-class girls’ 
college at Anagni, near Rome, for the daughters of teachers, The new institution, 
patronized by Queen Margherita, and bearing her name, promises to become one of 
the most practically organized in Italy. The education given there is adapted to the 
needs of the social class to which the girls belong. One of the most recent innoya- 
tions is a special section of instruction in practical agriculture and dairy work. 
“A distinguished Italian lady, Signora Aurelia Cimmino Folliero de Luna, has also 
had notable success in establishing a rural school for girls in northern Italy. 
“The new minister of public instruction, Senator Pasquale Villari, ‘4 understands the 
need of reforming female education. His predecessor had already shown that his 
interest in it lay not by words only, but by deeds. He lately ordered all the insti- 
tutes of fine arts in Italy to be opened to women, so as to encourage them in art cul- 
ture. Having heard how deficient was female education in convents and national 
colleges, he charged Commendatore Gioda, who was at the head of ordinary and 
popular instruction, to inspect girls’ colleges throughout Italy and report officially 
on their state. His report is most valuable to anyone interested in Italian girls 
education, for it gives a very clear idea of its present state. Woe have now in Italy, 
throughout the various provinces, 1,584 female colleges, thus divided:

“In these colleges, many of which are convents, 47,358 girls are boarders, while 
29,204 daily pupils attend the schools and receive their education there. So Italy 
has at present 76,652 young girls being trained to be sensible women, the mothers of 
the future Italian generation. 
“The three royal female colleges in Naples, entirely self-supporting, deserve 
special notice. One of these three Neapolitan colleges is especially meant for girls 
of the middle class. * * * Professional schools have met with comparative suc- 
cess for girls of inferior social Conn and in some of these instruction in 
culinary mysteries has been given. 
“Queen Margherita is greatly interested in girls’ culture in Italy. If she could 
exercise more influence, her mind would be inclined to view woman’s progress favor- 
ably. Asaconstitutional sovereign, with a desire not to exceed the authority given 
her, she abstains from indulging her liberal views. Highly cultivated herself, she can 
fully appreciate the divine enjoyment of a refined mind, and her personal encourage- 
ment to anyone willing to contribute to female progress in Italy is most generous, 
She receives with the greatest interest ladies actively engaged in any intellectual 
pursuit, whether it be art, which she loves and feels deeply, or philanthropy, which 
she practices largely, or teaching, or reforms in education. 
‘‘Last May, in Florence, to celebrate the sixth centenary of Dante’s Beatrice, 
Count Angelo de Gubernatis, the distinguished Italian writer, conceived the brilliant 
idea of seizing the occasion to honor Italian women by the first exhibition of intel- 
lectual or manual work done by them during the thirty years since Italy was united. 
This exhibition proved a revelation of the capability of Italian women. Besides 
their work—mannal, literary, and artistic—many of them have shown talent by 
musical entertainments, recitations, dramatic performances, tableaux vivants, and 
choruses. Several among the best Italian female writers have given public lectures 
on woman’s position in Italy, both past and present. These lectures have just been 
published in a large volume edited by Civelli, in Florence, with the characteristic 
title of La Donna Italiana descritta da Secrittici Italiane in una serie di Conferenze 
tenute all’Esposizione Beatrice in Firenze. The book proves that the woman ques- 
tion in Italy is adyancing and that old prejudices are disappearing. Gold medals 
have been awarded to several of our cleverest Italian women—for music to Gilda 
Ruta, the composer, for her lecture on education; to Ida Baccini, the popular writer 
for children, and to the author of this article, for her literary productions. 
“The Countess Irene della Rocco de Castiglione established at Turin an excellent 
magazine for girls, receiving assistance from some of the best writers of the day. 
The review has been taken in charge by one of the first publishing firms in Florence. 
“The principal reforms needed in our modern educational system is that girls 
should be trained, not as a separate sex, but as an important part of the great 
human family. A girl’s teachers are too apt to forget that the great object of edu- 
cation is to call forth the noblest faculties of her intelligence and to lead her, as far 
as possible, toward mental perfection. We can not secure a high tone of national 
life until it is admitted that girls should be trained rationally. In no country is 
woman’s influence so Strong, for, from the cradle to the grave, men are accustomed 
to be led and swayed by women’s influence. Men of the less bigoted type would 
gladly see the dawn of an era of intelligent education for girls, Even now the 
Italian Government has given some attention to the matter, and it is proposed to 
make the royal palace Fayorita, near Naples, a first-class college for girls. It would 
require little more than a rational arrangement of the course of study to make it a 
complete success. Z 
“All these events show that a serious movement is in progress for the elevation of 
women in Italy. When this has taken place, Italian girlhood will be the happy 
vision of a poet. We want not alone the fresh, blooming colors of youth in the 
appearance of our daughters, not only the pure classical outlines of our Greco-Latin 
types. We hope to see in their clear, dark eyes the light of a noble soul; on the fair 
brow we look for the lines of thought, and in the sweet smile for the signs of a

gentle if passionate heart. And when education has done its work, elevating our 
lovely girls to the perfection they can and ought to attain, Italy will once more be 
the land of genius, of art, of poetry.” 
In an address by the Signora Zampini-Salazar before Sorosis, in New York City, in 
December, 1893, it was stated that the women of northern Italy were more progress- 
ive and more cultured than those of the southern provinces. 
About women’s organizations Signora Salazar gave numerous interesting facts. In 
Bologna the most active and progressive women were to be found, and they worked 
with a common aim. They accomplished much by their solidarity. Mazzini’s influ- 
ence was strongly felt there, and the efforts of an Englishwoman who had married 
his best friend did wonders in organizing and helping the cause of culture and prog- 
ress. In Milan also the efforts of women of intellectual attainments in behalf of 
their sisters were earnest, but they lacked the peculiar strength of those of Bologna. 
There were excellent schools for girls in Milan, but no such strong centralizing influ- 
ence as in Bologna. 
In Turin the intellectual women were, according to Signora Salazar, engaged in 
trying to organize for the advancement of their sex. In Rome there were two clubs, 
both intensely conservative, but both enjoying royal patronage. One was a sort of 
philanthropic organization, which helped working women, established day nurseries 
for the children of working women, and the like, but did no purely intellectual 
work. The other was aclub for culture, but Signora Salazar regretted to say that 
the most vital subjects ever introduced were themes from ancient history, and that 
the general effect was to deaden rather than awaken the intellects of the members. 
It was well attended, she said, because the Queen attended, but the interest the mem- 
bers seemed to take in one another's little bonnets and pretty toilets was the great- 
est one manifested. 
In the matter of educational advantages for women, Italy was behind the times. 
There were public schools for elementary culture and normal schools for teachers, 
but a painful lack of girls’ colleges. The opening of universities, lyceums, gymna- 
siums, and art schools to girls did not serve a very great purpose, as there existed a 
strong prejudice against coeducation. 
In the professions women were handicapped by public opinion and masculine oppo- 
sition. As doctors of medicine they had most liberty, especially since Queen Mar- 
gheritahad made a woman one of the honorary physicians of the court. Butin the 
legal profession the utmost a woman could hope to attain was the privilege of help- 
ing her brother, husband, or father. In music many Italian women did great things, 
but it required natural genius and the endurance of great hardships. In business 
women were employed in telegraph and telephone offices. In schools they might be 
teachers, but not superintendents. 
The end toward which she and all other earnest women were working was the 
recognition of Italian women as individuals and the granting to them the largest 
possible personal freedom. 
That the time would come when all this would be accomplished Signora Salazar 
did not for a moment doubt. Italy as a nation was young, she said, and one could 
not expect more progress among its women than had been made. ‘They possessed 
all the inherent traits of greatness, and only time and the educating influences of 
time were needed to bring them into the front ranks of women. 
PORTUGAL. 
The general consensus of opinion has been, in the Iberian peninsula, that an ele- 
mentary education and certain accomplishments were about all that young girls 
needed to make them acceptable members of society, but now that the Queen of 
Portugal herself has studied for and taken a doctor’s degree, that of M. D., it may 
be inferred that an impetus has already been given which will lead to the pursuing 
of higher studies by many of her subjects. In the latter part of 1891 Dona Amelia

Cardia obtained the diploma of doctor of medicine from the Medical College in Lis- 
bon. Her graduation thesis on hysterical fever was applauded by the faculty. 
Women are admitted to the Royal Conservatory of Music in Lisbon; they learn to 
speak the languages in the private boarding schools to which most of them gravi- 
tate; they also study the elements of mathematics, geography, history, etc., and 
some of the girls pass creditable examinations for entrance to the lyceums and col- 
leges for boys. If they choose to enter these secondary schools, the law of June 14, 
1880, permits them the same privileges as to the male sex. Portugal possesses two 
normal schools for girls, in Lisbon and Oporto; in 1890 there were 58,045 girls receiv- 
ing an elementary education, and 3,955 pursuing a higher course in lyceums and 
colleges. 
SPAIN. 
Until a late date there have been no laws admitting women to university privi- 
leges in either Portugal or Spain, and yet women were not debarred from such study 
if they so desired. In Spain, by decree of May, 1892, women are admitted as ‘‘hear- 
ers,” by order of the Queen Regent, in the name of King Alfonso. Should any 
women desire to matriculate, special arrangements may be made. There were 20 
women studying in the universities during the year 1892; the most of them were in 
the courses in medicine and pharmacy. 
In the Pedagogical Congress, held in Madrid in 1892, several noted women of Spain 
presented papers on the woman question; the trend of their discussion was to indi- 
cate the need of training in normal schools for women as one of the first elements of 
amuch needed amelioration of existing conditions. These papers are presented in 
La Escuela Moderna, but there seem to be no immediate results of the discussions 
beyond the awakening of interest in the need of a higher standard of education for 
women, 
Among those who have greatly aided the women in Spain, either through their 
own literary attainments or through efforts toward ameliorating existing conditions, 
are the Sefioras Matilda del Real, Concepcion Arenal,! and Emilia Pardo Bazan. 
The inspectress of municipal schools in Madrid, Dofia Matilda del Real, in a paper 
before the pedagogical conferences held in Madrid in 1893, clearly portrayed the need 
of first learning to understand the nature of the child—here Froebel methods are 
cited—before proceeding to educate it. She earnestly advocated such training as 
would lead the child to look back upon its youth as a happy childhood. Dofia Con- 
cepcion Arenal, in her writings, depicts the faults of woman’s education—“if it 
can be so called”—in Spain. Oftentimes in the schools for girls the school mistress 
is unfitted for such employ, and “the major part of the time is employed in manual 
branches [feminine handiwork, doubtless], and it is an exception if the school mis- 
tress knows how to read intelligently, or to write without violating the rules of 
orthography, and to explain the most elementary parts of arithmetic.” In higher 
grade schools the girls are taught geography, history, French, and music, but the 
instruction is not thorough. The lady advocated that there be similarity of educa- 
tion for men and women (Que la educacién debe ser la misma para el hombre que 
para la mujer),? and that they work harmoniously together in educational institu- 
tions. Doia Emilia Pardo Bazan, one of the best-known women of letters in Spain, 
and a novelist whose writings are distinguished by great truth of local coloring, 
adds greatly to the estimate of woman’s higher education in Spain. 
The schools founded by the Association for the Education of Women (Asociacion 
para la ensefianza de la mujer), in Madrid, are benefiting hundreds of girls who 
attend the courses in pedagogics, modern languages, and painting, or who pursue 
the business course.

In the school of music and declamation, and in that of arts and trades, both in 
Madrid, many girls have followed the courses. In the former there were 918 in 
1880-1881; in the latter, 130 in 1881.! Later statistics are not available. 
RUSSIA. 
The history of woman’s education in Russia seems to date from the accession to 
the throne of Catherine the Second, and many educational and charitable institutions 
were established during her reign, 1762-1796. In 1764 a royal order established an 
“ Educational Home for Girls of Noble Birth,” and within a year young girls of the 
middle classes were admitted to a division of that home. The course of study 
extended over twelve years, and admission was from the fifth or sixth year. Pupils 
of noble birth received instruction in the ordinary branches, in the elements of 
rural economy, in architecture and heraldry, in etiquette, and the observance of the 
laws of polite society. The girls of the middle classes had their attention turned to 
household economy, the proper management of a home, knitting, weaving, ete. 
The Empress Marie Feodoroyna (1796-1828), in turn, assumed the immediate direction 
of this educational home, and gave it an endowment of 1,300,060 rubles ($510,923). 
A number of educational and benevolent institutions for girls and women were 
established during her reign. Among others, the Kharkof Institute, founded in 
1817, which authorized the admission of girls of noble birth, of merchants’ daugh- 
ters, of paying and nonpaying pupils. These were the beginnings of the charitable 
and educational institutions, homes, hospitals, schools for the deaf and dum), etc., 
which are grouped and known as the Marie Institutions.? 
During the reigns of the Emperors Nicholas I and Alexander II (1828-1881) the 
number of institutions for the education of girls so increased that a ‘‘ Supreme 
Council of the Educational Establishments for Young Girls” was established (in 
1845), which in 1873 was annexed to the tutelar councils. In 1858 the first public 
day school, admitting girls of all conditions and religions, was established. (In 
1880 there were 459 educational establishments—including orphan homes, foundling 
hospitals, ete.—known as the Marie Institutions.) In 1891 there were 30 public 
schools for girls which, together with gymnasium and pedagogic classes, were 
attended by 10,664 pupils. The instruction is similar to that in the 32 institutes for 
girls, where 7,680 girls were giving their attention to the Russian, French, and Ger- 
man languages, geography, history, mathematics, zoology, pedagogy, calligraphy, 
drawing, music, singing, gymnastics, and dancing. Several of these institutes have 
“special pedagogic classes in which particular attention is paid to the study of 
foreign languages and to proof lessons for training the pupils in the art of teach- 
ing.” The final examinations entitle (when passed) to a diploma qualifying for 
teacher or as governess.? 
In 1891-92 there were 455,167 girls reported as receiving an elementary education 
in Russia, 89,473 in schools of a secondary grade (these include girls’ gymnasia and 
progymnasia), 3,832 in professional schools, and 400 in university colleges for 
women (in 1890).¢ 
In 1869 the minister of public instruction gave permission for the organization of 
a series of public lectures, for women, in history, philosophy, and science, at St. 
Petersburg and Moscow. In 1872 higher courses were opened in Moscow, special 
attention being given to the study of universal literature and Russian history. In 
1876 an imperial ukase authorized the foundation of higher courses, on various sub- 
jects, for women at different universities in Russia. There were no general regula- 
tions, and the organization of such courses was considered temporary. In 1884 a

committee was created to formulate the best plan of organization for the superior 
education of girls in the Empire, and in 1889 regular four-year courses for higher 
study were created. There are two divisions, the historico-philological and the 
mathematical. 
(1) In the historico-philological section are taught: Religion, psychology, logic, 
history of philosophy, Russian language, old Slavonic, history of Russian literature, 
ancient and modern theory of literary forms, Slavonic idioms and literature, uni- 
versal literature (this includes Italian, French, German, and English literatures. in 
their connection with the development of Russian literature), Russian history, his- 
tory of the peoples of Slavonic race, ancient history, history of modern times, history 
of arts; Latin language and literature. 
(2) In the mathematical section: Religion, general course of mathematics, ana- 
lytical geometry, algebraical analysis, differential and integral calculus, astronomy, 
physics, organic and inorganic chemistry, physical geography, and analytical 
mechanics. 
In the year 1891 there were 385 students in the four courses, of whom 298 were in 
the historico-philological and 87 in the mathematical section. The tendency of 
study is toward history and literature, although the philosophical and mathematical 
students gave evidence of thorough study in such theses as “On the constitution 
of our self-consciousness, according to Taine and Strahoff,” and “Euler’s formule of 
quadratics,” ete.! 
Woman in medicine is discussed under ‘‘ Woman in the professions ;” Russian women 
in Swiss universities under Switzerland. 
FINLAND, 
The educational authorities of Finland permit women similar privileges to men 
in the matter of university study, subject to the restriction that any examination 
passed by @ woman can noé¢ entitle her to other appointments than such as are in 
accordance with existing laws and regulations. Nor is any woman entitled to 
receive such free scholarships as are distinctly intended for men. 
It is stated? that as early as 1870 a woman student passed an examination for 
admission to the university in Helsingfors, another followed in 1873, and then there 
is an interregnum until 1885. Seventeen women students were in attendance in 1889, 
increased to 44 in 1891 and to 56 in 1893. In 1894 there are 5 in the law course, 5 in 
medicine, 33 in the sciences, 30 in philology and history; total, 73.3 
In the year 1893 there were 212 women obtaining a business education in commer- 
cial schools, 175 in the agricultural and dairy schools, 4,712 in secondary grade 
schools, and 263 preparing, in normal schools, for the teacher’s profession.+ 
In the earlier years women desiring to enter the university were obliged to fit 
themselves for such purpose in private schools. Since 1883 there are coeducational 
schools opened to them. 
EASTERN EUROPE, 
The chief features of the organization or fundamental laws of Turkey are based 
upon the Koran. According to it “woman’s education must be equal to man’s” 
(chapter 22, verses 33 to 35). From the beginning of the reign of Mohammed there is 
mention of well-educated women,® but it is within the last twenty years that the 
subject of woman’s progress has become of interest.

The Turkish schools for girls at Constantinople in 1893 numbered 97, ranging from 
primary to normal, with 6,545 day scholars, 320 boarding pupils, and 178 teachers. 
The studies are Turkish language, history and geography of the Ottoman Empire, 
arithmetic, drawing and piano, needlework, and embroidery. The normal school 
has been established twenty-two years, and graduation therefrom entitles to adiploma 
permitting one to teach in Turkish houses or in girls’ schools of the provinces. 
The Greek schools for girls in Constantinople graduate pupils who have become 
directresses of other Greek schools in Turkey. The studies are the foreign lan- 
guages, geography, mathematics, history, art, vocal and instrumental music, drawing, 
and painting. The Greek schools number 55, with 218 classes, 5,233 students, and 
199 teachers. 
The Armenian schools for girls in Constantinople are supported by three commit- 
tees—the Armenian Catholic, the Armenian Gregorian, and the Armenian Protes- 
tant. They include elementary and secondary grades, with 67 classes, 1,880 pupils, 
and 250 teachers. 
The schools of the Israelite Alliance educate many students free of charge. In 
1893 they reported 201 pay and 967 free students and 36 teachers. The programme 
included French, Hebrew, German (that is, the elements taught to students of those 
nationalities), history and geography, arithmetic, natural history, physics, chemistry, 
drawing, singing, embroidery, and sewing; also laundry work, i. e., ironing. The 
main aim of these schools for girls is to educate the poorer classes. 
The centers of education are at Constantinople, Smyrna, Salonica, Seres, Adrian- 
ople, Philippopolis, and Yanina. The college curriculum aims to be similar to that 
of European nations; the French tongue is compulsory in the schools; the works of 
foreign authors are studied under the direction of French and German teachers; in 
the higher elementary schools the studies include zoology, mineralogy, botany, cos- 
mography, the elements of anthropology, and physics; the body, too, is well trained 
by gymnastic exercises. Late movements indicate the establishment of high schools 
for girls in the largest cities of the Ottoman Empire, as an outcome of a movement 
in Greece proper, where the closing of the higher gymnasia for girls was met by an 
appeal of all the students to the ministry of education, where their arguments 
brought about a reopening of the same. 
In Bulgaria there were 42,206 girls receiving an elementary education in 1890 out 
of 261,968 girls of school age. Four gymnasiums for girls are also reported in the 
Statesman’s Year Book for 1896, from which these facts are gleaned: 
“Tn point of education the Bulgarian women of Macedonia and Thrace are now, 
in the towns, much on a par with their Greek neighbors. Formerly, in districts 
where Bulgarian national schools did not exist, the girls attended the schools belong- 
ing to Greek communities, but since the principality acquired its autonomy, the 
anti-Hellenic movement has succeeded, to a great extent, in substituting Bulgarian 
for Greek education in the Turkish provinces. Teachers are supplied from the 
training colleges of Bulgaria proper, where the schools are organized on the new- 
est and most approved European systems. There is at Philippopolis a girls’ lyceum, 
- established eight years ago, at which 150 girls receive a high school education, many 
of whom become mistresses of Bulgarian schools in the Turkish provinces.”! 
In Servia all the schools under the ministry of education are free, even including 
the university. In the elementary schools 11,204 girls were receiving instruction in 
1892-93; in the lower gymnasia 321 girls; in high schools for girls or normal schools, 
612 girls.

Women; Tafur Hanum is familiar with French, Turkish, Greek, Arabic, and Persian languages; 
Emineh Semich Hanum is the author of an arithmetic. [See address on education and literature of 
the women of Turkey, delivered before the World’s Congress Auxiliary, July 22, 1893, by Seftorita 
Esmeralda Cervantes.] The women of Turkey are fully described, especially as regards habits and 
customs, in The Women of Turkey*and Their Folk-Lore, by Lucy M. I. Garnett.

In Roumania, in 1892, there were 27 women who had entered the university at 
Bucharest and 26 at Jassy. The Roumanian minister of public instruction appointed 
a woman (in 1894) to the newly created position of professor of the German language 
in the university at Bucharest. 
INDIA.! 
From India comes the information that many earnest reformers are endeavoring to 
overcome the obstacles to the elevation of women in that country. In 1883 a com- 
mission was appointed to investigate the whole system of education in India. The 
education of women and the instruction of Mohammedans received special attention. 
In British India alone it is estimated that only 1.8 per cent of girls of school age 
attend school. Statistics of schools in 1893 showed that there were 3 women’s col- 
leges, with 101 students; 419 secondary schools, with 35,747 pupils; 5,399 elementary 
schools, with 284,250 girls attending; 1,496 private schools for girls, with 42,371 stu- 
dents. The census for 1891 gives 197,662 girls under instruction, 543,495 not under 
instruction, but able to read and write; 127,726,768 not under instruction and 
unable to read and write. No information was obtained in regard to 12,028,210 
women. Generally speaking, the school education of Indian girls comes to an end 
between the ages of 10 and 12, at the age when American and English girls are just 
at the threshold of learning. 
The most important movement in recent years is that aiming to give medical relief 
to the women of India. Lady Dufferin, the wife of Lord Dufferin, former viceroy 
of India, manifested great interest in this movement, which is referred to under the 
heading of medical instruction. 
Among other women who take a foremost position in India is Dr. Jagannadham, a 
native of India, who first studied three years in Madras, then two years at the Edin- 
burgh School of Medicine for Women. Having passed her examinations successfully, 
she obtained the diploma of the Scottish colleges. At Edinburgh she was demon. 
strator of anatomy, then for a year house physician in the Edinburgh Hospital for 
Women and Children. At present she is connected with the Kama Hospital in Bom- 
bay, but is to fill a position in the association established by Lady Dufferin. 
Pundita Jumnabai, a Brahmin lady, has taken an active part in establishing a 
female association at Jamnugger. This lady is a Sanscrit scholar, and is well versed 
in the Hindu Shastras. She has given readings from the Shastras before the Zenana 
jadies in Bombay. 
The Punjab Association for the Promotion of Female Education supports and 
manages the Victoria School, with its ten branches in the city of Lahore. This 
school aids in the preparation of female teachers for schools throughout the proy- 
ince. Industrial, normal, and higher courses have already been, or are about to be, 
introduced in the Victoria School. 
There are universities in Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Allahabad, and the Punjab. 
These are merely examining bodies, but they have numerous affiliated colleges. The 
number of women students attending these higher courses of training is unknown 
to date, but a few years ago 13 European women and 3 native girls were among 
the successful students for matriculation at Bombay University, while at Madras 5 
Tinnevelly native Christian girls were successful candidates at the matriculation 
examinations. This was the first time that native girls from Tinnevelly had passed 
the examination.

Although women are still in a somewhat dependent condition in Japan, the study 
of other nations, and the influx of an educated foreign population—with highly edu- 
cated women in their families, the return of Japanese students from other countries, 
all tend to indicate to the enlightened Japanese statesmen that broader fields of 
education are now open to women. 
In the school system now found throughout the Empire, girls and boys are equally 
provided for. Every morning the streets of the cities and villages are alive with 
boys and girls clattering along, with books and lunch boxes in their hands, to the 
kindergarten, primary, higher, and normal schools. Every rank in life, every grade 
in learning, finds its proper place in the new school system, and the girls eagerly 
grasp their opportunity and show themselves apt and willing students of the new 
learning offered to them. Upon the young girls the influence of the school is to 
make them more independent, self-reliant, and stronger women. The women of 
to-day in Japan who are taking the lead in the elevation of women are those belong- 
ing to the Samurai class, i. e., those who belong to military circles.!. According to 
the statement of Miss Bacon they are endeavoring to “establish, upon a broader 
and sure foundation, the position of women in their own country, for the Samurai 
women to-day are eagerly working into the position of teachers, interpreters, trained 
nurses, and whatever other places may be honorably occupied by woman.” > 
There are and have been several Japanese women studying in this country, and 
statements indicate that Japanese girl students are by no means rarities here. 
There is one at Wellesley and a second, Miss Fuji Tsukamoto, was at Wilson College 
for Women at Chambersburg, where she was considered one of the brightest students. 
She graduated in June, 1894, and on commencement day led in a debate on the inter- 
esting question, ‘‘Have the more recent influences of the Occident on the Orient 
been a benefit tothe latter?” There was still another Japanese girl, Miss Tsune Hirata 
San, at Western Maryland College, Westminster, Md., where she was graduated in 
1890. Returning to Japan, she married and is now working in the missions at 
Nagoya. Vassar College also claims a Japanese graduate. Japanese boy students 
are common enough, and the girls also appear to appreciate American educational 
institutions.

Miss Umo Tsuda, a special student at Bryn Mawr, is endeavoring to raiso money 
to found a scholarship for Japanese women in America so that they may be prepared. 
as teachers to return to their own country. The reserve of Japanese women and the 
class distinctions make it easier for the Japanese to teach women than for foreigners. 
‘ 
THE SPANISH-AMERICAN COUNTRIES. 
There is less available information in regard to the higher education of women 
in these countries than in Europe, but as social factors the Spanish women are 
preeminent. 
In Mexico a decree was promulgated in 1890 for a normal school for women teachers 
in the City of Mexico, free instruction in a four years’ course to be given to the stu- 
dents. Then a special fund was provided for 80 meritorious students, who were, 
however, to teach for three years after finishing the course. The Government has 
also provided for the education of women in a literary and scientific institute which 
has a high grade of study (including trigonometry, calculus, philesophy, chronology, 
literature, physics, chemistry, natural history, and bookkeeping). A lyceum for 
women was also founded in 1878 which takes up subjects that are considered essen- 
tial to the proper training of women. This is also supported by Government funds 
The preparatory school of San Ildefonso, which has trained many distinguishes 
men, has also received girls who desired a similar grade of educational advantages, 
The schools of arts and trades for women are also crowded with students, from the 
young girl to the woman of mature years, all of whom receive free instruction in 
such branches as printing, bookbinding, sewing, fancy work, knitting, trimmings, 
fringes, making cords and tassels, ete. Piano and vocal music are also taught, and 
the pupils have an elementary course of study. 
In 1892, according to the Boletin Semestral de la Direccién General de Estadistica, 
there were 899 Government and 927 municipal schools for girls. Enrolled in the girls 
schools were 138,037 pupils; in average attendance, 107,725. These schools appear 
to be of elementary grade, but it is not specifically stated. 
In Costa Rica, according to the Memoria de Instruccién Piiblica, aiio 1892, there 
were 65 women preparing to become teachers, and 11 had already received the 
diploma requisite for such position. In the Colegio superior de Sefioritas 75 women 
were following a secondary course of instruction; professional instruction included 
16 women students. Doubtless this does not represent the number of women inter- 
ested in higher studies, but the report does not enlarge upon this phase of education. 
According to the ‘‘Anuario de la Inspeccion general de Ensefianza, atio 1892-93” 
there were 7,421 girls enrolled in elementary grades, 5,281 in regular attendance, 
1,471 graduates. ‘Elementary instruction of both sexes is cbligatory, free, and 
provided for by the government,” so it is stated in ‘‘The Republic of Costa Rica” 
by J. B. Calvo, 1893. 
In Guatemala, as is indicated by the law! for public instruction, the same regula- 
tions apply to both boys and- girls in schools of different grades. It is stated, how- 
ever, that sewing and domestic economy enter into the course for girls, and they are 
not obliged to matriculate from the secondary grades.? Private schools and colleges 
for girls are reported,.but the number is not definitely stated. There are 434 elc- 
mentary schools for girls. 
In Honduras there are three colleges, or secondary grade institutions, for women. 
In Nicaragua of late years there has been manifest interest in regard to the educa- 
tion of girls. Among other institutions of a secondary grade in the city of Granada 
‘there is a college for young ladies, where several hundred pupils are enrolled. The 
curriculum is quite extensive, but special attention is paid to musical studies.

  948 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Several of the graduates of this college are said to be following higher educational 
courses in the United States. 
In Argentina, in 1894, there were 89,648 girls in public schools of elementary grades 
and 3,767 women teachers; in private schools, 30,473 girls and 1,161 teachers; in 
primary departments of normal schools, 6,097 girls and 260 women teachers.! The 
three higher grade normals—one for men and one for women, and one mixed— 
train professors and teachers capable of directing or superintending in the pub- 
lie schools. The programme of study is similar for men and women. Until 
within a few years ‘‘the women of Argentina were content with such instruction as 
made them fascinating members of society,”? but now they desire still higher study. 
According to Dr. Zubiaur, ‘‘a new era in the social evolution of the Argentinian 
people has dawned, and a stimulating effect upon the other Latin-American countries 
has been produced by the overcoming of ancient prejudices in regard to woman’s 
status.” The Senorita Cecilia Grierson has lately obtained her diploma as M. D., 
after six years of study at the faculty of medicine in Buenos Ayres. The sejiorita 
was the first young lady of Argentina to win such a degree. Prior to entering upon 
her medical studies she obtained the diploma of instructress from the normal school 
of the capital.? 
In Brazil the statistics appertaining to the education of girls are quite meager. 
Ten years ago there were reported to be 1,315 schools for girls throughout Brazil. 
In 1888-89 it was stated that there were 500 coeducational schools.* In the Muni- 
cipio Neutro, or federal district, which includes Rio de Janeiro and its environs, 
there were, in 1892, 120 public elementary schools of the first grade (59 for boys and 
61 for girls), with an enrollment of 4,444 boys and 4,056 girls; classed as subsidized 
schools were 32, with 667 boys and 879 girls; the normal in Rio de Janeiro had 248 
women pupils and 32 men. The Instituto Benjamin Constant had 27 men and 21 
women pursuing its course (in 1892), which included science and letters, universal 
history, and music. This is an institute for the blind. Private institutions (col- 
egios) numbered, in the Municipio Neutro, 119, with 6,073 boys and 3,628 girls. One 
is led to infer that the sexes are separated, and that these are schools for boys and 
schools for girls, but the matter is not specifically stated. It is known, however, 
that according to early laws coeducation was not allowed, but about 1885 Dom 
Pedro II established a number of schools where boys and girls recited together, but 
were kept apart outside of the recitation rooms.’ A writer on ‘“ Brazil: Its Condi- 
tion and Prospects,” describes a girls’ school in which there was a seat of honor 
“(where a pupil sits for half an hour who has her lessons the most perfect in her 
class.” The day of his visit three pupils stood up because they had been the recipi- 
ents of this favor during that forenoon.’ 
In Chile women are well educated in so far as general accomplishments are con- 
cerned. They have a special aptitude for modern languages, and many speak with 
fluency French, German, and English. In the Instituto Nacional, the oldest college 
in Chile, which received its charter from the King of Spain over one hundred years 
ago, there are many earnest, thoughtful students. Among them there are said to be 
two or more women who are studying law. In the Colegio Norte Americano, estab- 
lished under the auspices of the M. E. Church of America, there are 250 girls study- 
ing higher branches, as well as music, painting, drawing, and the languages. 
In Uruguay there were 591 women engaged in the profession of teaching in public 
schools and 549 in private schools. In the National Normal School for Girls from

EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 949 
1877 to 1891 there were 114 girls who received ‘‘the title of professor for the first 
degree,” and 29 ‘‘for the second degree.” In the public schools of various grades 
19,135 girls were under instruction. Women are also engaged in charitable and 
philanthropic work, and among such organizations is the Ateneo de la Mujer. 
In Venezuela, according to Aristides Rojas, in his Origenes de la Instruccién Piib- 
lica en Venezuel::, a college for girls was founded as early as 1768 and placed in 
charge of the civil authorities of Caracas. It was called “Colegio de Ninas Edu- 
candas,” and aimed more especially to teach orphans and poor girls some handiwork 
that would be useful to them. About the same date a college and convent school 
for young ladies of higher degree was founded and wel! endowed. Later develop- 
ments in regard to woman’s education are unchronicle., but it was stated in 1893 
that there “‘were 14 national colleges for women and a normal school for girls.” 
Pupils are not specified. 
WOMEN IN THE PROFESSIONS. 
WOMEN IN MEDICINE. 
The endeavor to present a complete account of what woman has accomplished in 
the medical profession alone would be futile; the facts presented will speak for 
themselves. 
According to Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi,! ‘the history of the movement for introduc- 
ing women into the full practice of the medical profession is one of the most inter- 
esting of modern times. This movement has already achieved much and far more 
than is often supposed. Yet the interest lies even less in what has been so far 
achieved than in the opposition which has been encountered; in the nature of this 
opposition, in the pretexts on which it has been sustained, in the reasonings, more 
or less disingenuous, by which it has claimed its justification. The history, there- 
fore, is a record not more of fact than of opinion. And the opinion expressed has 
often been so grave and solid in appearance, yet proved so frivolous and empty in 
view of the subsequent event, that their history is not unworthy careful considera- 
tion among that of other solemn follies of mankind.” 
The reasons that women naturally manifest more interest in the medical profession 
than in any other profession are, according to Dr. Jacobi, “the special capacities of 
women as a class for dealing with sick persons are so great that in virtue of them 
alone hundreds have succeeded in medical practice, though most insufficiently 
endowed with intellectual or educational qualifications. When these are added, 
when the tact, acuteness, and sympathetic insight natural to women become 
properly infused with the strength more often found among men, success may be 
said to be assured.” 
If one remembers that even in the early fifties advanced courses of study for 
women were hardly known in this country, and that even for men the standard of 
attainments, from the medical side, was low,*then one may leok with interest upon 
the following table, which shows that in 1892-93, notwithstanding all the obstacles 
that had to be overcome, 1,302 women were enrolled in the medical schools of the 
United States?:

    Add to this the fact that there are 4,555 women physicians and surgeons in the 
United States, and that 3,000 women have been licensed to practice within the last 
ten years, and that there are 7 medical schools for women alone, then one may well 
agree with Dr. Jacobi that ‘‘the change from the forlorn conditions of the early 
days has been most rapid, and those who survived the early struggle, and whose 
energies were not so absorbed by its external difficulties that not enough were left 
for the intrinsic difficulties of medicine, have been really invigorated by the con- 
test.” 
The statistics cited indicate the various steps taken in the medical profession by 
women. The question of further needs arises. ‘Future advance for the education 
of women in medicine must be in the line of their admission to the schools where 
the highest standard of education is maintained, and to such affiliation of their own 
schools with universities as may bring them under the influence of university disci- 
pline. There is no manner of doubt that, with a few unimportant restrictions, 
coeducation in medicine is essential to the real and permanent success of women in 
medicine.” 
And, furthermore, it may be said that ‘because women require the intellectual 
companionship of men, to be able to recognize the highest intellectual standards, or 
to attain them in some cases, and to submit to their influence in others, it does not 
follow that they have no special contributions of their own to offer to the work of 
medicine.” 
High standards should be the aim of women as well as men, and it may be said 
that ‘Medical education in this country is now making one of the longest strides 
forward that has occurred in its history. This step is the lengthening of the course 
to three and four years of eight or nine months, instead of the old course of two 
years of four or five months.”! Another point has also to be taken into considera- 
tion, that is, regulations governing medical education vary in the different States. 
In New York? a woman must pass the State regent’s examination in spelling, arith- 
metic, elementary English, English composition, geography, United States history, 
and physics before she can matriculate at college. After the M. D. degree has been 
obtained another State examination, covering the studies of the course, must be 
passed before she can practice. This applies to men and women alike. For exam- 
inations in other States see article on Medical Edueation.! 
The first efforts made in England by women who desired to study medicine are due 
to Miss Garrett (now Mrs. Garrett Anderson, M. D.), who in 1860 began the study of 
medicine with a view to registration and practice under the medical act of 1858. 
Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell had obtained a degree of medicine in 1849 in America, and 
was already a practicing physician in England, but Miss Garrett tried for some time 
‘to obtain admission as a student at Apothecaries’ Hall, London, where she attended 
some of the classes with male students; in lieu of attendance upon others which 
were forbidden, she paid comparatively heavy fees for private tuition by recognized 
teachers. Many difficulties were thrown in the way of her receiving hospital instrug- 
tion; these her energy and ability surmounted, and in 1865 she succeeded in obtain- 
ing registration as a licentiate of Apothecaries’ Hall. Thus she became a legal and 
‘duly qualified’ medical practitioner. Her title of M. D., however, she acquired 
from no English examining body, but from the University of Paris, where she passed 
the necessary examination with great distinction.” 
This movement initiated by Miss Garrett was soon continued by Miss Sophia Jex 
Blake, who in 1869 applied to the University of Edinburgh for admission to medical 
study with the purpose of taking a degree. The opposition then encountered was 
set aside after five mouths’ deliberation by the university court, when other women 
joined with her in desiring similar opportunities. Five women took the same courses

EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 951 
as the male students, matriculated and passed the same examinations. Again there 
was determined opposition on the part of the university authorities. As the number 
of women desiring medical study had increased to 10 in 1874, their friends introduced 
a bill into the House of Commons ‘to remove doubts as to the powers of the univer- 
sities of Scotland to admit women as students, and to grant degrees to women.” ! 
This bill was thrown out in 1875. 
“Meanwhile a strenuous and, as it proved, a partially successful effort had been 
made to further the movement in another direction. In the autumn of 1874 was 
established the London School of Medicine for Women, with a strong staff of eminent 
teachers, and the number of students who enrolled themselves on its book conclu- 
sively proved that such a school was wanted and would be vigorously supported. 
But another difficulty arose. The medical examining body considered very properly 
that students coming before them should have received practical clinical instruc- 
tion in a hospital and by the bedside. To provide such a hospital de novo and at once 
was not possible. The London School of Medicine accordingly applied to existing 
hospitals to admit students, but in every case met with a refusal. What was to be 
done? Happily public opinion had by this time begun to tell upon Parliament and 
the Government, and in 1876 Government agreed to favor a bill introduced for the 
purpose of enabling the British examining bodies to extend their examinations to 
women as wellas men. Before the end of the session the bill received royal assent 
and became a law. A few months later the Irish College of Physicians availed 
‘themselves of its provisions, and admitted to their examinations Dr. Elizabeth 
, Walker Dunbar, Dr. Frances Hoggan, Dr. Louise Atkins (M. D.’s of Zurich), Dr. 
Sophia Jex Blake, and Dr. Edith Pechey (M. D.’s of Berne), who were thus entitled to 
places on the medical register. Not long afterwards the Royal Free Hospital gen- 
erously opened its doors to the students of the London School of Medicine for 
Women, and this was followed by the resolution of the senate of the London Uni- 
versity to admit women to their medical examinations and degrees. Thus the battle 
was won in England.” 
| In 1894 the first degrees in medicine were conferred in Scotland on two ladies. 
The following is an interesting description of this event: 
“At the graduation ceremony in Glasgow University on July 26, for the first time 
in the history of Scottish universities the degrees of bachelor of medicine and mas- 
ter in surgery, M. B., C. M., were conferred on two ladies. Principal Caird, vice- 
chancellor of the university, officiated, and there was a large representation of the 
university teaching staff. The Bute Hall was filled by a numerous audience of stu- 
dents of both sexes and of the general public. As Miss Marion Gilchrist, who 
ranked third on the list of the graduates who took the degrees ‘ with high commen- 
dation,’ passed up to the dais to be ‘capped’ by the principal, she received a per- 
fect ovation of enthusiastic applause, which was warmly joined in by the professors: 
and Miss Lillian Cumming was quite as heartily welcomed. 
_ “Both the ladies who have the honor of being the first graduates in medicine of 
any Scottish university have studied for the last seven years in Queen Margaret 
College, now the woman’s department of the University of Glasgow, viz, three 
years in arts and four years in medicine. Miss Marion Gilchrist was born at Both- 
well Park, 9 miles from Glasgow, and received her education previously to joining 
the college in schools at Bothwell and Hamilton and by means of private study. 
In her college career, after distinguishing herself in her art classes, she took the 
general certificate of Queen Margaret College, the university degree in arts not 
being open to women at the time. 
“Tn the course of her medical studies she stood first in her class in zoology, prac- 
tical chemistry, anatomy, histology, physiology, surgery, medicine, pathology, and 
midwifery. She took her clinical work in the Royal Infirmary and in the Royal 
1} Woman's Work and Worth, by W. H. Davenport Adams.

  Hospital for Sick Children, in both of which abundant facilities are given to women 
students. She has now been appointed assistant to Dr. Joseph McGregor Robertson, 
a physician in practice in the west end of Glasgow. 
“Miss Alice Lillian Louisa Cumming was born at Houston, Renfrewshire, and edu_ 
cated at schools in Glasgow. Her seven years in college have been characterized by 
steady, persevering, and excellent work. She will begin her medical practice by 
acting as assistant to her father, Dr. James S. Cumming, Blythswood Square, 
Glasgow. 
“Founded in 1882 (by the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of 
Women, which was formed in 1877 with the object of bringing university instruc- 
tion or its equivalent within the reach of women), Queen Margaret College, in 1890, 
added to its faculty of arts a school of medicine for women. This was organized 
entirely on university lines, and with the view of preparing for university degrees; 
and when, in 1892, in consequence of the ordinance of the universities’ commission- 
ers authorizing the Scottish universities to admit women to instruction and gradua- 
tion, Queen Margaret College became the women’s department of the University of 
Glasgow, its classes in medicine, taken previously to its incorporation with the 
university, were recognized as preparing for the degree. 
“Hitherto it has been chiefly to the younger universities and colleges in Britain 
that women have had to look for admission to instruction and graduation in arts 
and medicine, and although instruction and graduation in arts has been granted by 
all the Scottish universities for each two years, the fact that one of the oldest uni- 
versities in Scotland (the University of Glasgow was founded in 1450) has now led 
the way in conferring its medical degrees on women taught within its own walls, 
marks a new accession to the facilities afforded for the education of women which 
will be welcomed by all who are interested in their welfare.” 
“The first French woman to take a medical degree was Mlle. Verneuil, who is still 
practicing at Paris (in 1883). She graduated from the Paris Medical School in 1870. 
Up to 1881 six more French women had followed her example, five taking their 
degree at the capital, and one at Montpellier. Since that time several new names 
have been added to the list, the last being Mlle. Victorine Benoit, who was gradu- 
ated at Paris in August, 1883, with the highest approval of the board of examiners, 
composed of such doctors as Potain, Strauss, Rendu, and Monod.” ! 
The Paris Medical Schcol was ever open to women, and this is due in part to 
Laboulaye, who, when asked, reported to the minister of public instruction: ‘‘The 
rules of the school say nothing on the subject. It would, therefore, seem the best 
and the simplest course to require of women who desire to pursue medicine the same 
preparatory studies and the same tests for graduation which are demanded of the 
male students, and thus allow both sexes to enjoy the same advantages offered by 
the school.” 
The general attitude of the public and of male physicians in France is described 
by a lady student, who says: 
“The medical faculty? of the University of Paris opened its doors to women in 
1868, but at first only a very few availed themselves of the privileges thus offered. 
In 1878 the number in attendance was 32; during the next ten years (1878-88) it 
increased to 114, and is at present 183, of whom the great majority (167) are Rus- 
sians. The remainder are Poles, Roumanians, Servians, Greeks, and Scotch, and 
only 1 German. * * * Many of. them, chiefly Russians, have been through the 
gymnasium; others have acquired a more or less thorough knowledge of literature, 
history, the natural sciences, and philology in such secondary schools as were acces- 
sible to them. As foreigners, they must all be examined in Latin and Greek before 
admission, and be able to translate passages from the easier classical writers, Cesar 
and Xenophon, at sight, and to analyze them grammatically. The courses of study

are pursued conjointly withthe young men, and this association, so far from produc- 
ing a demoralizing effect, tends to elevate and refine both sexes. * * * The pro- 
fessors and directors of the hospitals praise the conscientiousness and diligence of 
the women, and acknowledge them to be, both in general intelligence and in special 
knowledge, fully equal to the men. The latter also admit the truth of this state- 
ment, and assert that they ought to be even superior in these respects, since they 
are not compelled to waste their time in cafés and cabarets.” 
Under the heading of liberty of the professions, M. Ostrogorski! states that 
in several countries women are permitted to be physicians or pharmacists. He cites 
England, Holland, Belgium, Sweden, and Russia as having by degrees permitted 
what seemed contrary to customs and laws. The Belgian Parliament has decided 
that ‘women may be admitted to the full practice of medicine and pharmacy.” 
Between 1881 and 1891 17 women passed the pharmaceutical examination, and 14 
received different degrees in the medical faculties of Belgium. Further information 
on this subject is found in a preceding section of this chapter. 
Holland has 4 women doctors; the first, Mlle. Aletta Jacobs, having a diploma of 
Groningen University, established herself in Amsterdam on September 15, 1879, 
after having completed a very brilliant course of studies. She was authorized by 
Minister Thorbecke to practice medicine. Another medical woman, Mme. Du Saar, 
or Dusart, has obtained a great reputation as an oculist. Mme. Tuschenbrack is a 
talented gynecologist, and was for many years assistant to the first gynecologist of 
Amsterdam, M. Mendes, from Lyons. The fourth woman doctor is Mme. Johanna C. 
Spruyt. A decree of November, 1870,? admitted women to the practice of pharmacy 
in the Netherlands, and a large number of girls have studied for this purpose. There 
are 727 aids of pharmacy, of whom 414 are men and 313 women. But although 
the Dutch universities have conferred 15 apothecary diplomas on young girls, there 
is not one woman who conducts independently a private pharmacy. The first 
pharmacy conducted by a woman will soon be opened in Utrecht, by Mme. Th. 
Olivier. 
Seven women possessing an apothecary’s diploma practice their professions; one, 
Mme. Alice Grutterink, is chief pharmacist of the Coolsingel Hospital in Rotterdam; 
another is pharmacist at the Hospital Wilhelmina in Amsterdam. Since 1880 a lady 
pharmacist, Mme. Charlotte Jacobs, sister of the woman doctor, has established 
herself in Batavia, where she owns a pharmacy, and conducts it with the assistance 
of her husband. 
There are in Holland women dentists and numerous nurses, trained in the special 
schools of Croix Rouge in The Hague, or Croix Blanche at Amsterdam.* 
In Sweden a royal statute of January 18, 1861, permitted women to become sur- 
geons, and a decree of June 18, 1861, gave women the right to learn dentistry and to 
practice that profession. On June 3, 1870, by royal decree, women were granted 
tho right to be examined for admission to the universities, to study medicine, and to 
graduate as doctors of medicine at the universities, and likewise to become practic- 
ing physicians. By a resolution of June 12, 1891, women are granted the privilege 
to be admitted as apprentices in apothecaries’ shops, and after the required exami- 
nation, to enjoy the same privileges as male chemists. ® 
In Denmark women obtained university privileges in 1875, and about half of 
those who enter the university take up the medical course. It is stated that four 
women have already become physicians. 
In Iceland a decree of December 4, 1886, conferred upon women the right to the

degree of bachelor of letters (bachelier és-lettres) and admitted women to the school 
of medicine and of theology. They may practice medicine. ! 
In Norway a law of June 14, 1884, gave university privileges to women; for the 
last six years they have been entitled to study pharmacy and to manage and own dis- 
pensaries, subject to conditions, In 1894 it is reported that a lady, Miss Eide, was 
graduated from the university, and was empowered to be an apothecary, the first 
woman apothecary in Norway. 
In Finland women are admitted to the university as students under similar condi- 
tions as male students. In 1894 theré were five women in the medical faculty at 
‘Helsingfors.2. Conditions as to medical practice are not known to date, but they 
doubtless conform to those of the Russian Empire. 
In Russia an imperial ordinance of August 2, 1890, regulates the conditions of 
future medical practice for women. * 
A medical faculty for women was created in 1872, and the first year’s course was 
attended by 106 women. During the second year there were 99 in attendance. 
After five years 69 women received diplomas. Political and financial reasons caused 
the cessation of the course, although it was successful in every way. Students 
were allowed to finish their studies, but no more were to be admitted.+ In 1892 it 
was again reported that the medical school was to be reopened, or, rather, that a 
medical institute for women physicians was to be created at St. Petersburg. The 
city was to give the necessary buildings and 160,000 rubles,’ the minister of public 
instruction 70,000 rubles, the minister of war 84,500 rubles, the Society for the 
Encouragement of Medical and Pedagogical Courses 2,500 rubles. <A favorable 
report had been made by the Senate in regard to this medical institute, and later 
information indicates that the plan was carried out. 
“The privy councillor, Dr. Von Anrep, has been appointed director of the Medical 
Institute for Women at St. Petersburg, which is designed chiefly to provide female 
practitioners of the healing art for the country districts of Russia. The courses of 
study, while giving special attention to diseases of women and children, and to 
obstetrics, embrace anatomy, physiology, general and special pathology, therapeu- 
tics, diagnostics, physic, chemistry, mineralogy, toxicology, surgery, sanitary sci- 
ence, dermatology, ophthalmology, psychiatry, neurasthenia, and kindred disorders, 
and extend over five years. A school of pharmacy is also to be established in con- 
nection with the institution.” Candidates for admission are expected to be not less 
than 20 nor more than 35 years of age.” § 
Special courses of lectures were opened in 1891 at St. Petersburg, in the Alexander 
Hospital, for women who are working there as chemists’ apprentices. Women are 
allowed to serve in this capacity in Russia if they have followed the full course of a 
girls’ high school or have passed an examination equivalent to that demanded of the 
male candidates, including as much Latin as is required of the men. A practical 
difficulty arose, however, viz, that women were found to be much slower in master- 
ing the profession of chemist than men, because they wero insufficiently grounded in 
botany, chemistry, mineralogy, etc. In order to remove this difficulty the town 
hospital commission has opened special courses in the above-named hospital where 
women can receiye instruction in pharmaceutics, botany, and chemistry. The neces- 
sary funds are provided by two anonymous members of the hospital commission, 
The lectures are to be delivered by professors of the Military Medical Academy. 
The example thus set by private individuals has been speedily followed by the

Russian Government, which, in connection with the discussion on the new regula- 
tions for pharmaceutical students, proposed to organize special courses for women, 
in which they may acquire a solid preparation for the profession.!_ These courses to 
be opened to women between the ages of 17 and 40 who have passed through a high 
school or equivalent institution, and, moreover, have passed a supplementary exam- 
ination in Latin and science. After a three years’ course students receive the rank 
of assistant without having to spend time in practical training as apprentices. It is 
explained that they will gain the necessary practical experience in the laboratories 
of the universities during their three years’ course. 
At the International Hygienic Congress, held in Budapest in 1894, reports and 
essays of much scientific value were given, among them one by Professor Erismann, 
of Moscow, the renowned Russian hygienist, regarding the study of medicino for 
women and the activity of women physicians in Russia, He arrived at the following 
conclusion: ‘‘Experience has shown us that in Russia women physicians have been 
very useful, aud that in certain positions, as in female seminaries and among the 
Mahometan population, their places can not be filled by men. Experience has also 
shown us that our women physicians are not only perfectly competent to the usual 
practice of medicine in cities, but also fulfill with skill and perseverance the far 
more difficult duties which devolve upon a city physician in the dispensary work 
among the poor. Even in extraordinary cases, such as wir and epidemics, they have 
shown themselves fully equal to the heaviest demands. The fears that the women 
physicians, through the peculiarities of their organization, would be hindered from 
following their vocation in a desirable manner, have proved groundless. Finally, 
experience has also shown us that among the people not only women and children, 
but also the men, have sought women physicians with the fullest confidence, and 
that in a high degree they have won the trust and love of the public. The combi- 
nation of the tender character of the woman and her innato talent for the care of 
tho sick, with medical knowledge, is therefore to be regarded as an exceedingly 
fortunate one. For these reasons it is desirable that opportunity should be afforded 
to women to gain a scientific education in medicine, such as is given to men, and 
after fulfilling the same preliminary preparations the same rights should be accorded 
to them as the State accords to men. Also there is no moral reason for separating 
the medical schools for women from those for men, or of building separate rooms 
for them. On the contrary, it is precisely for ethical reasons that it is desirable that 
to the women be accorded directly admission to the lectures of the already existing 
medical faculties.” 
In Austria the minister of worship and public instruction, by decree of May 6, 
1878, forbade women registering as “hearers,” or matriculating as students in the 
universities of the Empire,? but women possessing medical diplomas in other 
countries were permitted to practice medicine throughout the Austro-Hungarian 
dominions. 
The position of women in Germany, as regards the professions, was given in detail 
under, ‘‘ The education of women in different countries.” It is here reiterated that 
medical lectures have been attended by women in Freiburg University, in Baden, 
but until the Government opens its medical examinations to them the attendance 
upon medical lectures is of no practical value. 
In Switzerland 4 women students were in the medical faculty of Geneva Univer- 
sity as far back as 1877-78. In all the universities it is the medical faculty which 
seems to attract the greatest number of women students. More details regarding this 
matter are foun under “Russian women in Swiss universities.” It is reported 
from Egypt that a woman, graduate of the medical faculty in Paris, was appointed 
in 1892 or 1893, physician to the mother of the Khedive.

  956 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
In Roumania a lady, Mme. Olga Sacara Tulure, has just passed her examination 
as M. D. before the medical faculty in Bucharest. Her specialty is diseases of 
children. 
In Bosnia and Herzegovina the need of highly educated women seems to be 
attracting attention, for the authorities have advertised for a woman physician 
whose appointment is to cover a one year period. 
“Dr. Anna Bayerova and Dr. Bohmuila Kectova have been appointed to the posi- 
tion of provincial physician of Bosnia. Both of these women studied the regular 
course in high schools for girls, and afterwards prepared themselves by private 
study for the university. They studied the curriculum of the gymnasium, and 
passed their examinations before a professor. Then they applied for admission to the 
famous university of Prague, but were refused admission. They then entered the 
University of Zurich, and graduated with honors—Dr. Kectova having been appointed 
assistant to Professor Rose in the woman’s department. Both returned after some 
years to Prague, and since the practice of medicine was prohibited took an extra 
course in obstetrics and followed this profession, waiting patiently for an oppor- 
tunity to open the way for their sisters. Both of the doctors were patriots and 
earnest advocates of woman’s cause, and their proceedings were watched with great 
interest. 
“The appointment which came first, Dr. Anna Bayerova, was hailed with jey by 
all the women of Bohemia. She proved herself such a success that Dr. Kectova 
was called to a similar position in pone The ladies are under military rules and 
wear a military uniform.” ! 
Women in the medical profession in Italy, Spain, and Portugal have already been 
referred to in an earlier part of this chapter, but it may be stated that ‘as early as 
the fourteenth century a female physician acquired a great reputation in medicine 
in Italy.” In 1891 the medical school of Lisbon graduated a woman as M. D., and 
last year (1895) the Queen of Portugal took a similar degree. In Spain, since 1892, 
several women are on university rolls as students, principally in medicine and phar- 
macy. One of the assistant physicians at the city hospital [presumably in Madrid] 
is Dofia Concepcién Alexandre.? 
The regulations goverring the medical profession for women are not specifically 
stated in these last-mentioned countries. 
WOMAN IN THE LAW. 
Next to the medical profession in point of interest to women comes that of law, 
and endeavors are made to trace woman’s advance in this field of action. Here at 
once difficulties are met, and one is inclined to say that woman’s position in the 
legal profession is hardly recognizable as yet, so few in number are those who have 
conquered a place before the law in this and other countries. It is amatter of record 
that there were 56 women attorneys in this country in 1882, 31 of whom had grad- 
uated from law schools. In 1894-95 there were 65 women pursuing a law course in 
professional schools, and it may be said that the majority of law schools admit 
women when requested to do so.° 
It is just to state that woman has not as yet had time to develop into a Webster 
or aChoate, and yet itis of interest to understand her present position before the law. 
As is stated by Ada M. Bittenbender,‘in regard to the full-fledged lawyer, ‘for 
various reasons quite a number of women admitted have not so far identified them- 
selves with law practice. Others have allowed themselves to be drawn into temper- 
ance and other reform movements, but the greater portion at once settled down to 
follow their chosen pursuit with no deviation, and are ripening into able, experienced

lawyers, and winning their fair share of clientage. Some confine themselves mainly 
to an office practice, seldom or never appearing in public; others prefer court prac- 
tice. Those who enter tho forum are cordially countenanced by brother lawyers and 
acceptably received before court and jury. As a rule they are treated with the 
utmost courtesy by the bench, the bar, and other court officers.” 
The first woman in this country to be recognized as an attorney at law was 
Margaret Brent, back in the colonial days, to whom, as executrix of the estate of 
Leonard Calvert! —first lord proprietary and governor of Maryland—was accorded 
the privilege of being received as his lordship’s attorney. She also appeared before 
the courts in her own affairs, as well as those of her brother. 
“The first woman since the days of Mistress Brent to ask for and obtain admission 
to the bar of this country was Arabella A. Mansfield, of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. She 
studied in a law office and was admitted to the Iowa bar in June, 1869, under a 
statute providing only for admission of ‘ white male citizens.’ ” 
The first woman to graduate regularly from a law school was Miss Ada H. Kepley, 
from Union College of Law in Chicago. This was in 1870. 
A movement of benefit to the law students of Michigan University was the form- 
ing, in October, 1886, of the Equity Club, its object being to encourage each other 
in their chosen profession. 
‘Another association of women lawyers,’ organized in 1888, is the Woman’s Inter- 
national Bar Association, having for its object: (1) To open law schools to women; 
(2) to remove all disabilities to admission of women to the bar, and to secure their 
eligibility to the bench; (3) to disseminate knowledge concerning women’s legal 
status; (4) to secure better legal conditions for women. 
“‘Women lawyers are welcomed as members of bar associations established by 
their brothers in the profession. Many have availed themselves of this privilege.” 
Women lawyers of this country are claiming the right ‘‘to practice before all 
courts, State and national, the same as male lawyers,” and when the existing statutes 
forbid they appeal to the legislature. 
The position of women in the legal profession is hardly recognizable in other 
countries as yet, and it is said that Hawaii is the only country outside of the United 
States where women can practice law. Be this a fact or not, it is well known that 
women have been permitted to study in legal faculties of the universities in several 
countries, and only when she has desired to enter the arena with men has she 
found herself debarred by laws, regulations, and edicts, then or previously pro- 
mulgated. 
In 1889 a lady graduate of the University of Michigan established herself as a 
lawyer in the Sandwich Islands, entering her father’s law office in Hawaii. Miss 
Hitchcock has also acted as sheriff ad interim.® 
In Russia, in 1875, a woman requested permission to be a “femme avocat.” 
Animperial ukase of January 7, 1876, forbade women to enter upon the profession 
(interdisant aux femmes l’accts de la fonction d’avocat). A similar attitude was 
adopted between 1886 and 1889 by Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, and Belgium toward 
women who desired to enter upon the law.! 
In Italy it seemed to be forgotten that in centuries past there were famous women 
teaching law in the universities or noted for their legal lore.®

Arguments innumerable were presented at Turin when the Signorina Lidia Poét,! 
after finishing her legal studies, claimed a place in the legal fraternity, but these 
arguments were of no avail. 
In Belgium, in 1888, Mlle. Marie Popelin, who had followed the legal course of one 
of the Belgian universities, essayed to break down the barriers against women law- 
yers, but was unsuccessful. The court at Brussels decided that women had neither 
“the leisure, force, nor aptitude necessary for the struggle and fatigues of the legal 
profession.” * 
France has but few law students as yet in the faculty of law, or rather the facul- 
ties, for, while there is only one University of France (having the degree-giving 
power), there are ‘‘ faculties” in Paris and in fifteen other centers. Seven years ago 
a Roumanian lady, desiring to practice law in her own country, took the doctor’s 
degree in Paris. A French lady obtained the same degree, and now teaches civil 
law in secondary schools for girls in Paris. It is stated that there are only 6 women 
graduates in law in France. 
In Denmark, by royal decree of May 12, 1882, women were allowed to present 
themselves for certain juridical examinations, but they were given to understand 
that they could not enter the legal profession. 
In Finland, at the University of Helsingfors, there were three women following 
the course in law in the year 1893.4 
In Sweden there are several examinations connected with the faculty of jurispru- 
dence. The one for “ candidatus juris utriusque” is the one mest commonly taken. 
It requires five years’ of hard study and has been passed by one lady.® 
In Switzerland the position taken by Dr. Emily Kempin as a privat-docent in the 
faculty of law of the University of Zurich has been considered a great step in 
advance, and her request was carried to the Federal Council. Her first course of 
lectures, commencing March, 1892, was largely attended. In the University of Berne 
a young woman from Odessa carried off a prize in competition with her fellow- 
students of the legal faculty, and it was won by a dissertation of real merit. 
In the Eastern countries a step in advance has been taken, as may be observed by 
the following statements: 
“The first and only lady lawyer of India is Miss Sorabji, a clever Parsee. She 
was induced to study law by her desire to help her countrywomen, who are for- 
bidden by religion aud custom to receive legal advice from men. The young weman 
won academic honors in India, and afterwards went to England and studied at 
Oxford, where she was successful in her work and became a protégé of the late 
Master of Balliol. So far her desire to practice in India has not been practically 
realized, but although she has accepted a good post as director of women’s educa- 
tion in Baroda she has by no means abandoned the cause to which with true 
Oriental fatalism she believes herself to be dedicated. 
“Mme. Tel Seno, a Japanese lawyer, is said to be the only feminine member of 
the bar in the land of the Mikado. She was educated in America. In addition to 
actively following the duties of her profession, she takes a great and practical 
interest in the welfare of her sex, and has founded a training school for women.” 
WOMEN IN THEOLOGY. 
Fewer women have entered the theological profession than either the medical or 
legal professions, yet “women bore an important part in the planting and early 
growth of the Christian Church. * * * In its periods of persecution the church

received no more devoted service than that given by its consecrated women. Tor its 
sake they cheerfully accepted martyrdom in its most cruel form. * * * Inall 
ages and in all lands women have given proof of a loyalty to Christianity as sincere 
as it was serviceable.”! 
To present an historical statement of woman’s efforts in the work of the Christian 
ministry would be of interest, but sufficient data are not available for the purpose. 
The entrance of women upon the work of the Christian ministry may be said to 
have begun with the preaching of Anne Hutchinson, who reached Boston in 1634, 
and there began preaching. As a result of her peculiar teachings she was banished 
from Massachusetts in 1637. Toward 1760 Barbara Heck gave the first impulse to 
Methodism in this country, and Susanna Wesley was the ‘‘real foundress of Meth- 
odism” in England; yet the Methodist Episcopal Church of America limits its recog- 
nition of women. The primitive Methodists have always employed women to reach 
the depraved classes, 
In the United States about 50 women have been ordained in the Universalist — 
Church, and all its schools and colleges save one are coeducational. In the year 1889 
there were 35 women on its register. In the Unitarian Church there are quite a num- 
ber of women preachers, some of them regular graduates from theological schools, 
others simply acting as helpmeets to their husbands. The Quakers regularly admit 
women as preachers. The Baptist clergymen freely admit women to their pulpits to 
speak upon great moral questions, but that church has taken no. steps leading to 
woman’s admission to the ministry. The Presbyterians, by a vote of 93 to 24, decided 
in 1889 that ‘tho ordination of a woman as deacon is in harmony with the New Tes- 
tament and the constitution of the apostolic church.” 
The Protestant Episcopal Church recognizes the value of the sisterhoods, while 
orthodox Congregationalists are now giving recognition to women in the theological 
field. 
In 1893-94 there were 10 women studying for the ministry in colleges of the 
Congregational denomination, 6 in Baptist colleges, and 4 in a Universalist college, 
(For further information vide chapter on Professional Education in the Report of 
the Commissioner of Education for 1893-94.) 
Woman does not appear in the ministry in foreign countries, but she is often 
allowed to take part by vote or otherwise in parochial affairs. (Vide ‘School 
legislation abroad.”) 
In the countries where she is allowed university privileges the theological facul- 
ties may or may not be opened to her, but study therein does not necessarily lead to 
the ministerial functions. 
The Greek-Oriental Church, prior to 369, admitted women to the priesthood. In 
the Occident they became deaconesses, but in the fifth century two popes and three 
councils definitely forbade the holding of such position,? 
In Iceland a decree of December 4, 1886, rendered the theological school of Reyk- 
javik accessible to women, but the obtaining of a degree did not give them the priv- 
ilege of preaching.’ 
In Finland, in 1895, a woman requested to be enrolled as a student of theology in 
the university at Helsingfors. This is stated to be the first woman who has applied 
for such study.® 
In Sweden the theological faculty in the universities is not open to women.* 
Other information is lacking in regard to women in the ministry, but each year 
brings new efforts of womankind to enter upon the professions, hence a future chap- 
ter may present more of interest on this subject.

‘WOMAN AS A PROMOTIVE FORCE IN EDUCATION. 
The gradual efforts toward improvement of educational conditions for women have 
been reviewed. The early struggles in different parts of the United States have 
been indicated, as woman recognized the many obstacles to be overcome ere a firm 
attitude toward life and life’s duties could be attained. The general conditions in 
the older continental countries have been presented, and observation indicates that 
the woman movement varies in intensity in accordance with the established customs 
of the different countries. A general statement of women in the professions has 
been added, and, while much more might be gleaned from many sources, the endeavor 
now is to indicate woman’s position as a directive force in the States and in other 
countries, as far as that information is at hand. 
SCHOOL LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
As a means of understanding the attitude of the different States toward the employ 
of women in positions where her voice is heard in educational affairs, a careful study 
of the school laws has been made, so that a clear understanding may be had of what 
the law really allows. This statement was originally compiled, by the present 
essayist, for the Woman’s Journal, of Boston, and has since been reproduced, in 
form of leaflet, and sent (by the editors) to the legislators of doubtful States. It 
has also appeared in Woman’s Work in America, and is now revised to date of 1893. 
Further revision, if there be such, will appear from year to year. 
The States and Territories which, according to the latest issue of their school 
laws, do not give women any voice in school affairs are twelve: Arkansas, Dela- 
ware, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, 
Alaska, Indian Territory, New Mexico, and Utah.! 
The States and Territories which confer certain privileges upon women are 36 in 
number. The privileges of 28 of these have been compiled from the school laws; 
the information in regard to the others is taken from returns? made to this office: 
Alabama.—W omen teachers are eligible for appointment on county boards, but are 
never appointed. (Return 1893.) 
California.—No person shall, on account of sex, be disqualified from entering or 
pursuing any lawful business, vocation, or profession. Women over the age of 21 
years, who are citizens of the United States and of this State, shall be eligible to all 
educational offices in the State, except those from which they are excluded by the 
Constitution. And more than this, no person shall be debarred admission to any of 
the collegiate departments of the university on account of sex. (School law, 1888.) 
Women are eligible on district and county boards. Women can not vote for school 
officers, but a bill was before the legislature in February, 1893, authorizing them to 
doso. (Return, 1893.) 
Colorado.—No person shall be denied the right to vote at any school district elec- 
tion, or to hold any school district office on account of sex. (School law, 1887.) 
Connecticut.—No person shall be deemed ineligible to serve as a member of any 
board of education, board of school visitors, school committee, or district committee, 
or disqualified from holding such office by reason of sex. (School law, 1888.) 
Florida.—A widowed mother or female guardian of a child of school age may vote 
for district school officers. (Return 1893.) 
Illinois. —Women are eligible to any office under the general or special school laws.

Nebraska.—W omen 21 years of age, resident of the district and owners of property, 
or having children to educate, may vote in district meetings. (School law, 1885.) 
They are also eligible as district and county officers and for city superintendent. 
Their vote affects disposition of school money.’ (Return, 1893.) 
Nevada.—Women are eligible to district school offices, and two hold such offices. 
(Return, 1893.) 
New Hampshire.—Women may vote at school district meetings if they have resided 
and had a home in the district for three months next preceding such meetings. They 
may hold town and district school offices. (School law, 1886.) 
Women are eligible to all school offices. (Return, 1893.)! 
New Jersey.—Women over 21 years of age, resident of the State for one year and 
of the county for five months preceding such meeting, may vote at school meetings. 
They are eligible to the office of school trustee. (School law, 1887.) 
They may vote for district school officers, which vote affects disposition of school 
money, and they are eligible to district school offices in districts organized under 
the general school laws. (Return, 1893.)! 
By decision of supreme court women can not vote for the election of members of 
boards of education, but may on other occasions. (Law, 1895.) 
New York.—No person shail be deemed to be ineligible to serve as any school officer 
or to vote at any school meeting by reason of sex who has the other qualifications 
now required by law. This permits women to act as school trustees and to vote at 
district meetings if residents of the district, holdin g taxable property, and over 21 
years of age. (School law, 1887.) 
The context of the consolidated school law of 1894 is more explicit. It states: 
Every person of full age residing in any school district and who has resided therein 
for a period of thirty days next preceding any annual or special meeting held 
therein, and a citizen of the United States, who owns or hires, or is in the posses- 
sion, under a contract of purchase, of real property in such school district liable to 
taxation for school purposes; and every such resident of such district, who is a citi- 
zen of the United States, of 21 years of age, and is the parent of a child or children 
of school age, some one or more of whom shall have attended the district school in 
said district for a period of at least eight weeks within one year preceding such 
school meeting; and every such person not being the parent who shall have perma- 
nently residing with him or her a child or children of school age, some one or more 
of whom shall have attended the district school in said district for a period of at 
least eight weeks within one year preceding such school meeting; and every such 
resident and citizen as aforesaid who owns any personal property, assessed on the 
last preceding assessment roll of the town, exceeding $50 in value, exclusive of 
such as is exempt from execution, and no other, shall be entitled to vote at any 
school meeting held in such district for all school district officers and upon all mat- 
ters which may be brought before said meeting. No person shall be deemed to 
be ineligible to vote at any such school district meeting by reason of sex who 
has one or more of the other qualifications required by this section. (School law, 
1894.)

EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 963 
Chio.—Every woman born or naturalized in the United States, of the age of 21 
years and upwards, who shall have been resident of the State one year and of the 
county, town, township, or other election district such time as the law provides 
for men preceding any election held for the purpose of choosing any school 
director, member of the board of education, or school council, under the general or 
special school laws of the State, shall be entitled to vote, and be voted for, at such 
election for any such officer or officers. (Amendment to school law of 1894.) 
Oregon.—Women who are widows and have children to educate, and taxable prop- 
erty in the district, shall be entitled to vote at district meetings. (School law, 
1887.) They are eligible to all school offices. (Return, 1893.)! 
Pennsylvania.—Women 21 years of age and upward are eligible not only to the 
office of county superintendent, but to any office of control or management under 
the school laws of the State. (School law, 1888.) As directors or comptrollers, 
women vote for county, city, or borough superintendents. (Return, 1893.)! 
Rhode Island.—Women can be elected to the office of school committee, and a 
women is as eligible as a man for school superintendent. (School law, 1882.) 
Women are eligible to township school offices and 6 women hold positions, (Return, 
1893.) 
Tennessee.—Women of the age of 21 years, and otherwise possessing the necessary 
qualifications, are eligible for the position of county superintendent, and twelve 
hold county school offices. (School laws 1889 and 1895; return 1893). 
Texas.—Women seem to be allowed as city superintendents, and there appears to 
be no legal barrier to women serving as district trustees. (Return, 1893.) 
Vermont.—Women have the same right to vote as men have in all school district 
meetings, and in the election of school commissioners in towns and cities, and the 
same right to hold school offices, except in cases otherwise provided. (School law, 
1893.) 
Wisconsin.—Evory woman who is a citizen of this State of the age of 21 years or 
upward (except those excluded by section 2, article 3, of the Wisconsin constitution), 
who has resided within the State one year, and in the election district where she offers 
to vote ten days next preceding any election pertaining to school matters, shall 
have a right to vote at such elections. Every woman of 21 years of age and upward 
may be elected or appointed as director, treasurer, or clerk of a school district, 
director or secretary of a town board under the township system, member of a 
board of education in cities, or county superintendent. (School law, 1885.) 
Before proceeding to quote the laws for the Territories, and those which have 
become States within the past few years,it may be well to state that the action 
taken by the constitutional conventions of the new States has, of course, superseded 
the former legislation enacted therein as Territories. Each of the State constitu- 
tions adopted by the voters contained important concessions in its favor, and no one 
of them expressly excludes women as voters. To make the matter more clear to the 
very latest date, it has been deemed advisable to place side by side the latest laws of 
State and Territory where the latter has been evolved into the former, so that steps 
in advance, if there be any, may be more easily observed. 
Arizona.—The Territorial law provides that no person shall be denied the right to 
vote at any school district election or to hold any school district office on account of 
sex. (Biennial Rept., 1883-84.) 
Dakota Territory.—In all elections held under the provisions of this act, all per- 
sons who are qualified electors under the general laws of the Territory, and all 
women of 21 years and over, having the necessary qualifications as to citizenship 
and residence required by the general laws, and who have children of school age 
under their care or control, are qualified voters. Women having the requisite qual- 
ifications are eligible to the office of school director, judge or clerk of election, town- 
ship clerk, or county superintendent of public schools. (School law, 1887.)

According to the latest State laws: 
(1) In South Dakota, the constitution grants women school suffrage, and provides 
that the first State legislature shall submit the question of full woman suffrage to 
the voters. The school offices are ali elective offices. (Return, 1893.) 
(2) In North Dakota, the constitution provides that women ‘may vote for all 
school officers and on any question pertaining to school matters, and may be eligible 
to any school office.” [At date of going to print a woman is superintendent of pub- 
licinstruction.] It also provides that any legislature may extend or restrict suffrage, 
to take effect when ratified by the voters. (School Laws, July 1, 1893.) 
Idaho Territory—The right of citizens of any school district to vote at any school 
election, or upon any school matter, or for county superintendent, or to hold office 
as school trustee or county superintendent, shall not be denied or abridged on 
account of sex. (School law, 1885.) 
In the State of Idaho the constitution grants school suffrage to women, subject 
to future revision by the legislature. 
Montana Territory—Every person, without regard to sex, over 21 years of age, resi- 
dent of a school district and a taxable inhabitant, is entitled to vote at the annuay 
school meeting for the election of trustees. All persons otherwise qualified are 
eligible to the office of county superintendent of common schools without regard to 
sex. (School law, 1887.) 
In the State of Montana, the constitution provides as follows: ‘‘ Upon all questions 
submitted to the vote of the taxpayers of the State, or any political division thereof, 
women who are taxpayers, and possessed of the qualifications for the right of suf- 
frage required of men by this constitution, shall equally with men have the right 
to vote.” 
Women are eligible to district school offices. (Vide Return, 1893; also School 
laws, 1895.) 
Oklahoma.—Women may vote for all school officers, and are eligible to district 
school offices. (Return, 1893). 
Washington Territory.—Women over the age of 21 years, resident of the school dis- 
trict for three months immediately preceding any district meeting and liable to taxa- 
tion; are legal voters at any school meeting. They are also eligible to hold or be 
elected to any school office. (School law, 1885-86.) 
In Washington State, the constitution empowers the legislature to grant school 
suffrage to women, and submitted full woman suffrage as a separate article along 
with the constitution to the voters, but it failed to receive a majority. According 
to the school law of 1893 (p.34), every person, male or female, over the age of 21 
years, who shall have resided in the school district for thirty days immediately pre 
ceding any school election, and in the State one year, and is otherwise, except as to 
sex, qualified to vote at any general election, shall be a legal voter at any school 
election, and no other person shall be allowed to vote. According to the answer to 
an inquiry, made by this office in 1893, the courts hold that women are not eligible 
to the office of county superintendent, but women have been elected to the office. 
Wyoming Territory.—Every woman of the age of 21 years residing in the Territory 
may, at every election to be holden under the laws thereof, cast her vote, and her 
rights to the elective franchise and to hold office shall be the same under the election 
laws of the Territory as those of electors. (Revised Statutes, 1887.) 
In Wyoming, the State constitution adopted by the voters grants full suffrage to 
women, and also, by a special article in its bill of rights, prohibits political distine- 
tions on account of sex. This constitution was adopted by a vote of 8 to 1. 
ScHoon LEGISLATION ABROAD. 
In foreign countries, woman’s exact position in school legislation is often difficult 
to understand. Her connection with local government administration is often 
clearly stated, and incidentally her power of voting in educational and ecclesiastical
-P-A-G-E-1023
EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 965 
affairs is mentioned. Hence, if there seems to be divergence from the main ques- 
tion it is done so as to more clearly indicate woman’s position in the different 
countries. 
Great Britain.—The local government act of 1888 admitted women to electoral 
privileges in England and that of 1889 to similar privilege in Scotland.! In school 
boards and boards of guardians (for the administration of the poor law), unmarried 
women are in the position of men. Married women can sit as members of school 
boards, but it is a questidén whether they can vote in school board elections. In 
some parts of England the officials accept their votes, in other parts they refuse 
them. In county couticil elections women can vote (if unmarried), but they can 
not sit as county councillors. In vestries (a kind of small county council) it is an 
unsettled question whether women can sit, but they vote in the vestry elections if 
unmarried. Such was the custom until the parish council bill was passed in 1894. 
This entitles women to vote for and sit on the parish and district councils and ves- 
tries, marriage being no disqualification.’ In the colonies matters have been carried 
still further, for the people in a township in New Zealand elected a woman mayor, 
and South Australia has granted woman suffrage. English women hold the place of 
churchwarden, are tax collectors, and registrars of births and deaths.? In 1873 the 
first inspectress of working establishments was appointed by the Government in 
England, and in 1875 a woman was appointed poor law guardian. 
In six parishes of England the parishioners have the right of appointing the vicar, 
and both men and women take part in the election.‘ 
Since 1869 Englishwomen possess the municipal franchise ‘for all purposes con- 
nected with and having reference to the right to vote in the election of councilors, 
auditor, and assessors.” 
In the spring of 1894 three women were appointed as members of the royal com- 
mission on secondary education. This is the first time that women have held stich 
places. 
The women of Ireland take no part in administrative offices, except in Belfast, 
where they are authorized to take part in the election of harbor commissioners, and 
about 5,000 of them have qualified to vote for councilors.‘ 
“The legal status of women in England,” a paper prepared by Eliza Orme, bachelor 
of law, University of London, for the World’s Auxiliary Congress on Jurisprudence 
and Law Reform, Chicago, 1893, gives such valuable information in regard to the 
above question that the greater part of it is here incorporated: 
“With regard to constitutional rights, English women hold a subordinate position, 
slightly improved by legislation during the last twenty-five years. The sovereign 
may be a woman. Peeresses, even those in their own right, can not sit or Yote in 
the Upper House. In the House of Commons women can not sit, nor can they vote 
in parliamentary elections. In local government their position is better, chiefly 
because the acts of Parliament relating to it are modern. 
«<(a) In school boards and boards of guardians (for the administration of the poor 
law), unmarried women are in the position of men. Married women can sit as mem- 
bers of school boards, but it is a question whether they can vote in school-board 
elections. In some parts of England the officials accept their votes; in other parts 
they refuse them. 
“(b) In county council elections women can vote (if unmarried), but they can not 
sit as county councillors. 
“*(¢) In vestries (a kind of small county council), it isan unsettled question whether 
women can sit, but they vote in the vestry elections if unmarried.

“There is an agitation on foot to make women, whether married or single, on an 
equal footing with men in respect of all these franchises. It is supported and 
opposed by members of both political parties. 
“With regard to personal rights, unmarried women are in the same position as 
men, except that under the factories and workshop acts there are certain restrictions 
of their labor. For instance, in most industries they are prohibited from working 
at night, or for more than so many hours in a week. In some cases this has resulted 
in the displacement of women by young men. In otlfer cases, where it has been 
impossible to do without women’s work, it has resulted in night work being discon- 
tinued and the hours per week reduced for the whole staff, men as well as women. 
Married women have not complete personal liberty, but their rights .are increasing 
by the alteration of the law, and it is difficult, in view of recently decided cases, to 
give an accurate account of it at the present moment. * * * 
“The laws of property give unmarried women the same position as men. Married 
women before 1870 were unprotected from their husbands except by the courts of 
equity, which upheld settlements made in their favor, and in other ways assisted 
them when property camo to them by will or otherwise. Since 1870 various acts of 
Parliament have been passed giving married women the right to contract, to convey 
property, to retain their own earnings, and in many other ways to occupy the posi- 
tion of independent owners of property. Wealthy persons continue to protect their 
femalo relatives with settlements as before, while the poorer classes derive but little 
benefit from the change of law. * * * 
“With regard to employment, women are handicapped in England more by 
custom than by law. Except for the factory acts I have mentioned, industrial pur- 
suits are freely open to them. They are employed by the Government in the post- 
office, and occasionally in prisons and other public institutions. They are largely 
employed as clerks, and no legal disqualification exists in occupations of this class, 
The professions are not open to them except in the case of medicine. The profession 
of law is in two branches with us. Persons practicing in the higher law courts are 
barristers, and those who prepare documents, advise clients, and conduct business in 
less important cases in police courts, etc., are solicitors. To enable women to 
become barristers they must be allowed to enter the terms of court as students, and 
this depends entirely on the will of the leading members of the profession. To 
enable them to become solicitors an act of Parliament would be necessary. Two 
women have been for some years practicing conveyancing, but without legal quali- 
fication. They have drawn up wills and simple agreements, which under the Eng- 
lish law may bo prepared by persons not qualified as barristers or solicitors. Other 
conveyancing, such as drafting deeds, they have done for qualified practitioners 
who have used the work in accordance with the maxim ‘qui facit per alium, facit 
per se.’ 
“T am not aware of any other important heads under which the status of English 
women is peculiar.” ! 
France.—In the Middle Ages, women of the nobility were not excluded from political 
power; in the States-General (Etats généraux) women took part in electoral reunions; 
during the Reign of Terror they claimed that as they had the right to mount the 
scaffold, they ought equally to mount “a la tribune.” Discussions followed at 
different dates in regard to their paying taxes if they were not allowed a voice con- 
cerning their own property. In 1793, in matters of local self-government, it was 
decided that ‘tout individu de tout sexe ayant droit au partage et agé de 21 ans 
aura droit de voter.” Women® in France are allowed to occupy the position of 
postmaster, prison inspector, teacher, director of infant and normal schools. Asa 
normal school director woman may take part in the election of members of the 
council in charge of elementary education and women are members of the provincial

councils. Possessing the power of the ‘‘électorat,” ' she is not ineligible to a seat in 
the higher council (conseil supérieur), which has administrative and consultative 
powers, and for several years a woman has been member of that counvil. As is 
stated by M. Paul Janet, in L’éducation des femmes, the construction of the edifice 
has only just commenced. Experience alone will indicate the outcome of the instruc- 
tion given. All progress has been attained by struggling against prejudice. Inthe 
Middle Ages the cultivation of the sciences was first considered to be sorcery; learn- 
ing was only supposed to be for the priests; at each step there was opposition—a 
struggle—but at last victory. So will it be inregard to the education of women. 
The freedom of choice is hers; knowledge is necessarily acquired without regard to 
sex; freedom of action and thought is the foundation of dignity and morality.? 
In Denmark women are excluded from taking part in the affairs of local govern- 
ment, but in Iceland, its dependency, with its 75,000 inhabitants, widows and 
spinsters of property are privileged to vote in all church and parish matters, and 
they hold an especially independent position. Iceland has an independent legisla- 
tive assembly, the “Althing,” whose decisions are to be sanctioned by the King of 
Denmark.! 
In 1895 a bill passed both houses of the ‘‘Althing” making women eligible to 
election on county and city boards. The signature of the King of Denmark is 
required to make this a law. Whether he has sanctioned this is not known at date 
of going to press.® 
For its own leeal affairs Iceland is divided into twenty-two districts (sysler), which 
are again divided into communes (krapper). The magistracy in these districts are 
appointed by the electors. According to a law of May 12, 1882, women have the 
right to take part in these elections as well as in the reunions of parishioners for 
the deciding of ccclesiastical affairs. 
In Norway women have no part in local government, except in school administra- 
tion, since 1889. In cities they are eligible to positions on school committees, and 
those who have children can vote for the election of inspectors. In rural communi- 
ties woman’s privileges are even greater; each district has an assembly which votes 
for school funds, decides other school affairs, and appoints inspectors. Women and 
men who pay school taxes take part in these assemblies. Fathers and mothers aid 
in deciding questions which do not appertain to expenditures, even if they do not 
contribute to the school funds. Women are also eligible to the position of inspector.! 
In Sweden unmarried women take part in the rural assembly meetings where there 
is no communal council, and yote at the elections which precede the formation of 
the councils. Women are eligible to positions on municipal committees for aiding 
the poor, and also as members of the school board at Stockholm and elsewhere. In 
1884 a commission was appointed to examine into the needs of higher education for 
women, and two women were appointed on the commission. Women occupy posi- 
tions as teachers, lady principals of schools, members of school boards, and as 
inspectors; in fact, if property holders, they are allowed many privileges in the com- 
munity, in trades as well as in school affairs. 
Since 1883 they have been allowed to take part in the nomination of pastors; since 
1889 they have been cligible to membership in ‘‘ the administrative council for pub- 
lic elementary instruction”; since 1861 they have had the right to serve as organists 
in Lutheran churches.+ 
In Finland women have been authorized to, act as members of school committees 
since 1869, and as active members of committees on public charities since 1889. As 
far as administrative questions are concerned, there is political equality of the sexes; 
unmarried women have the same rights as men in parochial assemblies, in so far as

the regulation of ecclesiastical matters and the nomination of the Lutheran pastors 
are concerned. They may also vote in general assembly (radhusstamma) in propor- 
tion to the amount of their taxes for municipal expenditures, but they are not eligi- 
ble for the position of municipal councilor.! 
In Russia the women of rural communities seem to have the rights of a ‘‘ feme sole,” 
to use the Anglo-Norman term; in Germanic countries* she is admitted, by proxy 
generally, to a vote in local matters where, as a property owner, she has interests, 
but how far this extends to school legislation is not clear. 
In Bohemia women are admitted into the councils of the committees having charge 
of the poor of the city or town. Inedifferent subdivisions of Germany, Switzerland, 
and Austria the electoral privileges accorded to property holders of the two sexes 
vary, and, as the educational side does not distinctly appear, the laws will not be 
cited. In the Latin countries woman is invariably excluded from participation in 
the administration of communal afiairs. In Italy,' however, she is connected with 
the administration of infant schools and, since July 17, 1890, with the administration 
of public charities. 
Investigation of the constitutions of the Central and South American countries 
would seem to indicate that women are not excluded from the exercise of political 
rights, and yet, with perhaps an exception in favor of Ecuador and Chile, it is not 
apparent that they make use of such privileges. 
MarrisGE RaTE OF COLLEGE-BRED WOMEN. 
The after life of the woman graduate from college is of interest to many, and sey- 
eral articles have appeared on this subject. Statistics of the marriage rate of women 
from coeducational and women’s colleges, by section and by country and at different 
dates, have appeared in several magazines.® A few of the main facts are here pre- 
sented. Generally speaking, the college women marry rather late, and the rate of 
marriage is Jower in the New England and Middle States than in the West. The 
percentage of marriages among the graduates of coeducational and women’s colleges 
was presented as follows in the Overland Monthly in 1890: 
Per cent. 
New England coeducational colleges - 
New England women’s colleges. -. 
New York coeducational colleges, last 12 years 
New York women’s colleges, last 12 years..... 
All coeducational colleges - . 
All women’s colleges ...-.. 
Western coeducational colleges. . 
     
      The comparative probability of marriage in the case of a coeducationally as 
against a separately college-bred girl would appear to be nearly as 5 to 3 in New 
England; in New York, as 5 to 4; on an average, as 3 to 2. There are no women’s 
colleges in the West to form a basis of comparison. The marriage rate of women, as 
represented by age, has been compiled by different persons, but neither by age nor 
section can absolutely accurate statements be presented. The conditions vary 
greatly from year to year; rates of marriage in different sections may increase or 
decrease within a few years’ period, and the question of marriage rate according 
to age is also mutable. 
“Under 25 years old,” writes Millicent W. Shinn in the Century, in 1895, “college 
women rarely marry; of 277 graduates of the latest three classes but 10 are married. 
If these youngest classes are left out of account, so that we consider only women 
who have passed 25, we find 32.7 percent married; after the age of 30 is passed,

-P-A-G-E-1027
EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN. 969 
43.7; after 35 the rate becomes 49.7, while of those who have passed 40 years 54.5 
per cent are married. The census tables do not fix exactly the general marriage 
rate for women of this age, but it is not far from 90 per cent. 
“The ultimate probability of a college woman’s marriage, therefore, seems to be 
below 55 per cent, against 90 per cent for other women—not quite two-thirds as 
great. The college woman marries later. The most rapid increase in the rate, in 
the figures just given for college women, is between the ages of 25 and 30, showing 
marriage most frequent at this period; while for women in general it is more fre- 
quent between 20 and 25. The census shows 9.7 per cent of all girls between 15 and 
20 married—an age at which virtually no college women ever marry.” 
This subject is now under discussion and research by members of the collegiate 
alumne, and hence a mere epitome is here presented. In future chapters it is 
intended to deal more fully with the question, if statements of additional value can 
be obtained. 
In regard to the marriage rate in England, an article by Mrs. J. E. H. Gordon, om 
“The after careers of university-educated women,” in the Nineteenth Century, gives. 
explicit details. She says that the total number of students who left Newnham 
College from October, 1871, to June, 1893, was 720. Leaving out 16 who have died 
and 37 foreigners who have gone back to their own countries, we find that 374 are 
at the present time engaged in teaching as a profession. Forty-seven have married, 
including 9 or 10 of the lecturers and teachers, * * * 
_ “At Girton the number of students who had been in residence since the foundation 
of the college up to the time when the report was published, in June, 1893, was 467. 
Of these, 75 had not yet completed their course of training; but of the 335 who 
obtained degree certificates, 123 engaged in teaching, 45 were married, 2 were 
missionaries, 6 were in Government employment, 4 were engaged in medical work, 
and 6 were dead. 
“Judging from the reports issued by these two Cambridge colleges, the larger 
proportion of university-educated women do not seem to make marriage their 
career in life. Of the ex-students of Newnham only 120 out of 720 have married, 
and at Girton 45 out of 335. * * * 
“Of the 79 students who have obtained the certificate for the mathematical tripos, 
6 have married; of the 97 who passed the classical tripos, 10 have married; 
of the 47 who passed the natural-science tripos, 7 have married. The only student 
who passed the theological tripos has married. Out of the 30 who passed the his- 
torical tripos, 4 have married. Of the 21 who passed the moral-science tripos, 3 
have married. But of the 40 lady students who have taken the ordinary pass degree, 
15 have married, a much larger proportion, as will be seen, than among the students 
who have obtained the honors-degree certificate. 
“From the Newnham College report I have not been able to ascertain the percent- 
ages of marriages among the ex-students who have taken merely the ordinary degree; 
but an examination of the tripos lists gives very much the same results as those of 
Girton—namely, out of 85 who have passed the mathematical tripos, 5 have married; 
of the 65 in the classical tripos, 8 married; of the 74 in the natural-science tripos, 
10 married; of the 64 in the historical tripos, 9 married; arid of the 38 in the medix- 
val and modern language tripos, 1 married. The only student who passed the law 
tripos has not yet married. 
“Tt appears, therefore, that about 1 in 10 of those who take honors at Girton mar- 
ries, as against 1 in 9 who take honors at Newnham; while about 2 in 5 marry of 
those who take an ordinary degree at Girton. Leaving out theology and law, as to 
which the data are insufficient, the order of precedence (matrimonially) of the 
various studies is as follows: At Girton, elementary studies, natural science, moral 
science, history, classics, mathematics, and, last of all, mediwyval and modern lan- 
guages. At Newnham, moral science, history, natural science, classics, mathematics, 
and again last, medieval and modern languages, * * *

970 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
“Turning to the reports furnished for our information by the women’s colleges at 
Oxford, we find that of the 173 students who left Somerville College between the 
years 1879 and 1892, 73 are engaged in teaching, 29 are married, and 1 is an assistant 
librarian of the Royal Society. 
«* * * The report printed by the principal of Lady Margaret’s Hall gives 
fewer statistics, but one gathers that the larger proportion of the ex-students now 
at work are engaged in teaching. The number of students in residence at Lady 
Margaret’s Hall averages 38. Holloway College has only been at work for seven 
years, and there has not been time for much development in the after careers of 
students; but of the 197 who have left, 7 are married, about 69 are teaching or pre- 
paring to teach, 2 are nurses, 2 are studying at the School of Medicine for Women, 
and about 47 aro residing at home.” 
From Victoria College, Belfast, Mrs. Byers sends the following particulars: ‘‘In 
addition to over 1,500 students of Victoria College, certificated by the Queen’s Uni- 
versity, Ireland; Trinity College, Dublin; Cambridge, Edinburgh, and London 
universities; the College of Preceptors, London, and the Intermediate Education 
Board, Ireland, there are 51 graduates of the Royal University, Ireland. These 
include graduates in arts and medicine. Eight former Victorians are at present 
medical undergraduates, with a view to becoming medical missionaries. 
“Many havo become wives of missionaries, and 16 unmarried ladies, former Vic- 
torians, are at present engaged in zenana medical and educational work among the 
women of Syria, India, and China. Twenty-one former students are now principals 
of flourishing middle-class schools in Ireland, in most cases of schools founded by 
themselves, while a large number who were engaged as private or other teachers 
have since married. 
“Twelve are at present head mistresses or assistant mistresses in high schools and 
other middle-class schools in England and the colonies. * * * 
“ Alexandra College, Dublin, is a large day school where girls come up to study 
painting, music, and various other subjects that are not taught at Newnham; but 
of the 61 ex-students of the college who havo taken the University of Ireland B. A. 
degreo from the college, and who would therefore be of the same standing as those 
who have left Newnham and Girton, 41 are engaged in teaching, 6 have married, 1 is 
a medical doctor, 1 is assistant to Sir C. Cameron, city analyst, and the remaining 11 
are apparently living at home. 
“The total number of ex-students from Girton, Newnham, Somerville Hall, Hollo- 
way College, and Alexandra College, whose after careers we have mentioned above, 
amounts to 1,486; of these, 680 are engaged in teaching, 208 have married, 11 are 
doctors or preparing to be doctors and medical missionaries, 2 are nurses, 8 or 9 are 
in Government employment, 1 is a bookbinder, 1 is a market gardener, and 1 is a 
ee # 
  lawyer. 
“The percentage of marriage among less highly educated women is greater than 
among university-trained maidens.”

CHAPTER XIX. 
CHAUTAUQUA; A SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL STUDY. 
By Herpert B. ApAms, Johns Hopkins University. 
Chautauqua is, first, an institution of learning, and as such has relationships to 
other sister institutions of learning. Chautauqua does not attempt to cover the 
field of secondary instruction in America, Thatis provided for by our common-school 
system. Chautauqua does not attempt to take the place of the higher institutions 
of learning. That field is also occupied. But Chautauqua endeavors to bring these 
fields together. Chautauqua has relationships with both, and is unique in its effort 
to do for the higher and for the lower a work which had not been undertaken before. 
And, indeed, in twenty years of its history, who does not see the magnificent work 
in this direction which has been accomplished? But more; Chautauqua is a sociolog- 
ical movement, and I wonder if yet we know or understand the philosophy of this 
movement that has swept over this country and over other countries, a movement 
that is in active operation in every State, a movement the beneficent influences of 
which have been felt by thousands. (President William R. Harper, University of 
Chicago, at Chautauqua’s twenty-first anniversary, August 7, 1894.)

Parr I.—Soctrau. 
Von Holst, the historian, advising a German official what to see on 
his way home from Chicago and the World’s Fair, said: “Go to Niag- 
ara and see the grandest thing in nature; then, if you want to see one 
of the most interesting things in the United States, turn the corner 
and go to Chautauqua.” 
This university of the people derives its name from Lake Chantau- 
qua, so called by the Indians from its peculiar narrows. It lies in the 
southwestern corner of the State of New York and is 85 miles from 
Niagara Falls. It requires three hours by train on the Western New 
York and Pennsylvania Railroad to turn the corner to this beautiful 
upland lake among the hills. It is 20 miles long and from one-half to 
2miles wide. It lies 700 feet higher than Lake Erie, which is seen by 
the traveler nearly all the way down the Lake Shore from Buffalo, and 
is especially lovely as you climb the Chautauqua County hills from the 
Brocton vineyards, where Thomas Lake Harris and Laurence Oliphant 
tried their unfortunate experiment in Christian socialism. 
Chautauqua may be reached in various ways: From Buffalo via Broc- 
ton and Mayville (at the head of the lake), either by the Western New 
York and Pennsylvania Railroad or by the Lake Shore parallel route. 
The Erie system touches at Jamestown and Lakewood, which latter is 
only 12 miles by steamer from Chautauqua. Thus from the East one 
can come by way of the Erie or New York Central or West Shore (via 
Buffalo); from the West by the Michigan, Erie, Lake Shore, or Nickel 
Plate; from Pittsburg by the Western New York and Pennsylvania, 
connecting at Corry, Pa., with the Pennsylvania system from Baltimore 
and Washington. The Chautauqua Lake Railway connects Chautau- 
qua with Mayville and the most interesting stations around the lake as 
far as Jamestown. Visitors should remember that Chautauqua, N. Y., 
is a definite place on the lake and on the map. That address is suffi- 
cient for railroad, postal, telegraphic, and express purposes, and should 
not be confused with “Point Chautauqua” or “ Chautauqua Lake” or 
“Takewood.” 
Decidedly the best approach to Chautauqua is by steamer from May- 
ville, Lakewood, or Jamestown. There is a freight and passenger rail- 
way terminus near the grounds for certain trains from Mayville, but 
the boat connections are better, and the lake trip is pleasanter. Com- 
ing across from Point Chautauqua or up the lake, one finds “Chau- 
tauqua” itself a beautiful and extensive sylvan town of 500 cottages, 
with some conspicuous buildings, such as the Pier House and the Hotel 
Atheneum. At the Pier the visitor must purchase a ticket of admis- 
sion to the grounds for a day, week, or month, according to the length 
of his proposed stay. Short-time tickets can easily be exchanged or 
extended if one desires to prolong his visit. 
Entering the grounds through the Pier gate, where one’s ticket is 
 
-P-A-G-E-1037
  CHAUTAUQUA. 979 
punched by the keeper, the visitor finds himself upon a pleasant, well- 
wooded peninsula, which was originally known as “Fair Point.” The 
charming situation, with its fine views over the lake and its breezy air, 
first caused this projecting point of land to be chosen for a camp meet- 
ing. Doubtless much the same motives which impel hunters and fish- 
ermen to this day on Lake Chautauqua to select breezy points of outlook 
for their tents influenced the first fishers of men who settled on Fair 
Point. It is still wonderfully pleasant, cool, healthy, and free from 
flies and mosquitoes. 
THE CHAUTAUQUA ASSEMBLY. 
The institutional and iegal basis of Chautauqua is the so-called 
Chautauqua Assembly. This is a corporation of property owners who 
intrust their interests to a board of 24 trustees, who are elected by the 
landed proprietors and cottagers of Chautauqua, and who have power 
to fill vacancies by cooptation when a quorum of electors is not present. 
Meetings of the cottagers and lot owners are actually held, and if there 
is no quorum their provisional elections are ratified by the trustees in 
power. The corporation is not a joint stock company for the purpose 
of securing dividends or booming real estate. ‘By the provisions of 
the charter, all surplus funds must be used for the improvement and 
extension of the Assembly’s work.” (Hand Book of the Chautauqua 
Assembly, 1893, p. 3.) 
How revenue is raised and profits are expended will be described 
under the heads of “Finances” and ‘‘Public improvements.” The 
philanthropic and educational characteristics of Chautauqua are its 
saving qualities. The two founders of this Christian commonwealth, 
Chancellor John M. Vincent and President Lewis A. Miller, have never 
received compensation for their services. Of course, the practical 
managers and employees of the Assembly are reasonably paid, and so 
are the teachers, lecturers, and entire educational staff. Contracts are 
usually made out in the name of the Chautauqua Assembly by authority 
of the president and chancellor. The business office of the Assembly, 
during the season, is on the premises, and several men are constantly 
employed in attending to the bookkeeping and money affairs of Chau- 
tauqua. The banking is done at Mayville, on the lake. No secret is 
made of the financial side of Chautauqua. The annual report made to 
the trustees by the secretary and superintendent of the grounds is 
printed in newspapers like the Jamestown Journal and in pamphlet 
form. Copies are given at the treasurer's office to anyone who applies, 
ASSEMBLY TICKETS, 
Everybody who pays the citizen tax for one or more days receives a 
Chautauqua Assembly ticket for the time of his sojourn. Instructors 
get a free pass, This ticket or pass is punched on one side by the gate 
keeper when the visitor enters the grounds and on the other side when   
-P-A-G-E-1038
  980 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
he goes out with the intention of returning, provided his ticket has not 
expired. A visitor may go in and out as often as he likes, but he must 
go through the regular gates and not climb over the fence; otherwise 
he might lose the proper balance of entries and exits recorded on his 
ecard. The officials are not disposed to be fussy with persons well 
known to them, and will occasionally pass a lady who has forgotten 
her ticket. One summer the writer accidentally got in without show- 
ing his pass and managed to ride out and in on horseback almost every 
day without having his ticket punched. He even went to numerous 
ball games outside the grounds and returned without serious challenge, 
thus preserving a perfectly clean score for the whole season. But the 
gate keepers understand their business and do their duty whenever it 
needs to be done. 
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS. 
An old Chautauquan, returning in 1894 after an interval of two 
years, I was astonished at the improvements manifest in the forest vil- 
lage. I noticed that many objects once unsightly had been cleared 
away. Well-kept lawns and grass plots, more open spaces, and flower 
beds now attract the eye. <A fine system of cement walks extends from 
the pier to the hotel, amphitheater, post office, and hall of philosophy. 
The streets are better graded and provided with gutters of brick or 
cement. Some of the street crossings are paved with brick. The 
grounds and buildings are lighted by electricity. A new power house 
has been built, containing a new engine and new pumps. Better drain- 
age has been secured for the cottages, and better sanitary arrangements 
in general. 
Upon inquiry of the superintendent of the grounds, Dr. W. A. Dun- 
ean, I learned that over $89,000 worth of permanent improvements had 
been made in the year 1893. I found that the grounds had been con- 
siderably enlarged by what is called the new south addition, including 
the ball ground, costing altogether over $4,000. All these improve- 
ments were made in a year of commercial panic and of great financial 
stringency. They indicate great confidence on the part of the trustees 
of Chautauqua, and convince the beholder that here is a remarkably 
successful plant, with every prospect of continued growth and useful- 
ness. When we reflect that all profits of this summer school are to be | 
put into further public improvements, our interest in the work is 
redoubled. 
THE HOTEL ATHEN ZUM. 
To one landing by boat at Chautauqua perhaps the most attractive 
building isthe Atheneum. This is a large hotel with a lofty tower and 
an imposing front piazza. The building stands on a grassy slope and 
commands one of the best general views of the lake and grounds. The 
Atheneum was built at a cost of $125,000 by a joint stock company,
-P-A-G-E-1039
CHAUTAUQUA. 981 
and one of the original investors presented one-fourth of the hotel stock 
to the Assembly. The hotel is conducted in the interest of Chautauqua 
and is an important auxiliary; it is not, however, regarded as a profit- 
able investment. The rates are not low, but are reasonable considering 
the shortness of the season and the privileges enjoyed. 
The Atheneum is the social center of Chautauqua. Here special and 
official receptions are held from the beginning to the end of the session. 
Here faculties and conventions meet. Here the officers, professors, and 
lecturers of Chautauqua are to be found. The Athenzeum parlors and 
piazzas are a general rendezvous and a social exchange for the guests 
of the hotel and the best personal elements that constitute Chautauqua 
society. Nice families come year after year to this hotel, and occupy 
repeatedly the same rooms and the same tables. Bishop Vincent and 
his family take their meals at the Atheneum. Dr. W. R. Harper, prin- 
cipal of the Chautauqua system, as well as president of the University 
of Chicago, always gathers the professors and lecturers around one 
social board. Passing through Chautauqua is a continual succession 
of interesting people—public men, well-known writers, clergymen, and 
educators. Most of them stop at the Athenzum. 
The office of the omnipresent secretary and superintendent of the 
grounds is at the hotel, and so is the general office of the Chautauqua 
Assembly. To this general office there daily pours a constant stream 
of Chautauquans who come on business matters relating to rent, cot- 
tages, lots, water rates, sewer connections, sanitation, wood, stoves, ice, 
and anything affecting the comfort of small proprietors or tenants. 
The Hotel Atheneum is thus the business as well as the social center 
of Chautauqua; and yet business never seems to interfere with pleas- 
ure. There is a place for both. Business is confined to corner rooms 
near the main entrance on the ground floor, and all the rest of the house, 
with its great hall and parlors, its long corridors and upper and lower 
piazzas, are at the service of guests. 
There is a beautiful lawn sloping from the Athenzum front to the 
water’s edge, a lawn with flower beds and great trees overgrown with 
creepers, and beyond lies the lovely, ever-changing lake; beyond that 
are peaceful blue hills and upland pastures. Dr. Richard G. Moulton, 
the English university extension lecturer, now permanently attached 
to Chicago and Chautauqua, says its lake scenery rivals that of Scot- 
land. He and the present writer lived for a month in rooms looking 
out morning, afternoon, and evening upon the same delightful views 
of lake and shore and sky. So charming, so free, so cool and quiet 
was the place that I tarried for seven days after the completion of 
my three weeks’ engagement at the college, in order to study Chautau- 
qua and let my impressions deepen. Moreover, I wanted, in my own 
mind, to contrast sharply the social life of Chautauqua with that of 
certain Canadian monasteries which I was about to visit. The way is 
not long in the summer season from a modern hotel to a medieval 
.

hospice, or from a university club to a community of monks! These 
institutions are historic kinsmen. 
NEW AMPHITHEATER. 
The new amphitheater was completed at a cost of $26,478 in the 
early summer of 1893, in time for assembly use. This solidly built but 
airy structure occupies the site of the old amphitheater, and is of the 
same width, but extends 13 feet farther down the ravine toward the 
lake and 30 feet farther up the hill. The new building is 174 feet long 
and 168 feet wide. Like a Greek theater, it is built in semicircular 
form into the side of a hill, but, unlike a Greek theater, it has a good 
roof—a very necessary thing in our climate. The roof is curved in the 
form of a turtle’s back, is 34 feet above the pit of the amphitheater, 
and is supported by trusses requiring only four rows of iron columns, 
which are so arranged on outer and inner half circles as to give a 
clear span of 100 feet in the center of the amphitheater. The rows of 
seats, with wood flooring, rise gradually from the pit, so that the outer 
circle is on a level with the top of the hill into which the horseshoe 
structure is built. A person standing anywhere upon the sidewalk, 
along the outer edge of the amphitheater, can take in at one glance the 
whole interior scene or arrangement. 
There below is the speaker’s platform projecting far out into the pit. 
Behind the platform and 9 feet higher up is the singers’ gallery, accom- 
modating 400, rising tier on tier, even higher than the ceiling of the 
amphitheater and having clearstory windows on either side for over- 
head light. The entrances into the amphitheater are various, but chiefly 
by aisles roughly concreted and radiating from the pit, like spokes from 
ahub. The singers’ gallery is accessible from both sides through gates 
and also from offices below the stage, whence singers and lecturers 
emerge with the director or manager. The amphitheater is lighted by 
electricity. The effect of the fringe or festoon of incandescent lights 
around the outer circle is very pleasing at night, but not so beautiful as 
is the light of day shining into that great amphitheater over the heads 
of 6,000 people, This open-air effect is heightened by the sight of a 
border of green trees just beyond the outer rim of seats. These trees 
wave and rustle with every breeze and afford a beautiful accompani- 
ment to the exercises inside the building. 
It is generally agreed among visitors that Chautauqua has no finer 
sight than her Sunday morning service in the amphitheater. There is 
something very uplifting in the grand chorus of voices always singing 
at the opening of the exercises: 
Early in the morning 
Our song shall rise to Thee. 
There is a certain form of responsive readings accompanying every 
morning service, and when conducted by Bishop Vincent it is particu- 
Jarly impressive. Prof. J. P. Mahaffy, of Trinity College, Dublin, thus
-P-A-G-E-1041
CHAUTAUQUA. 983 
speaks of Dr. Vincent and “the great Sunday morning service,” which 
the professor himself attended: ‘‘Though the majority—the great ma- 
jority—were what we call Dissenters, whose devotions have a some- 
what different type from those of the Church of England, he [Bishop 
Vincent] had so ordered his liturgy that every word of it was not only 
in harmony with his own kindred branches of the Christian Church, 
but with’mine and with those of every reasonable Episcopalian. I can 
honestly say it was the most impressive service I ever attended.” The 
late Professor Freeman would have called it a religious folkmote. 
There is great catholicity shown at Chautanqua in the choice of 
Sunday preachers. Phillips Brooks used gladly to accept invitations 
to preach there, and last summer Bishop Coxe was among the succes- 
sion of Protestant clergymen—Methodists, Baptists, Congregational- 
ists, and Presbyterians—who appeared upon the Chautauqua platform. 
Such liberals as Dr. Lyman Abbott and Dr. Edward Everett Hale are 
much liked by Chautauqua congregations, which are at once orthodox 
and enlightened. Religion is a very vital and very fundamental ele- 
ment in the educational work at Chautauqua. Any passing visitor will 
quickly perceive that moral and religious forces are the foundation and 
stay of the whole complex of institutions. 
The song service at 7.30 Sunday nights is much enjoyed by the peo- 
ple, but on week days the amphitheater is used for a great variety of 
purposes. There are often religious or musical exercises in the morning 
hours; an educational lecture at 11 o’clock; a popular address at 2.30 
p.m., and a concert, a dramatic reading, or a stereopticon exhibition 
in the evening. Almost everybody goes to the amphitheater at some 
hour of the day, according as one has leisure or inclination, but the 
largest audiences are usually at night, when people are free and dis- 
posed to be entertained by music or illustrated lectures. 
It is no easy task to hold an amphitheater audience. Chautauquans 
are so accustomed to good speakers and to things really interesting or 
edifying that a dull lecturer will find his audience quietly stealing 
away from him. Popular taste is generally correct as to what is worth 
hearing or seeing. Unprofitable reformers, demagogues, and bores are 
quickly found out by the people, to the great advantage of the manage- 
ment, which never engages manifest failures for a second season 
In the opinion of experts, the amphitheater is an easy one to speak 
in. Dr. Edward Everett Hale is said to be a great admirer of the 
acoustic properties of the new building. A speaker with a clear, dis- 
tinet voice is easily heard throughout the vast interior space, even 
when he talks in a perfectly natural way, without any striving for ora- 
torical effect. Dr. Hale ascribes the acoustic excellence of the amphi- 
theater partly to its having no extended system of floors. He says: 
“Mother Harth is a better sound reflector than boards.” But there is 
enough flooring for all practical and «esthetic purposes. The whole 
construction of the new amphitheater was designed for good acoustic 
effects, 
 
-P-A-G-E-1042
984 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
THE CHAUTAUQUA SALUTE. 
There is a singularly striking custom which one sees at rare intervals 
in the great amphitheater. When the presiding officer wishes to show 
special honor to some distinguished lecturer or visitor from across the 
sea, he proposes to the audience to give the honored guest upon the 
platform the “Chautauqua salute.” Immediately a thousand white 
handkerchiefs are waved in the air, and the vast interior slope of the 
amphitheater seems all alive with color and motion. ‘The effect is pic- 
turesque and pleasing in the extreme. It appeals only to the eye, and 
yet it surpasses every kind of noisy applause. 
The natural origin of this graceful custom is very interesting. Chan- 
cellor Vincent thus explains it: In the early days of the assembly, when 
the meetings were held in the auditorium in Miller Park, Professor 
Green, a deaf-mute, of Bellevue, Ontario, was giving a pantomimic 
lecture one afternoon, in which he portrayed incidents in the life of 
Christ. The audience applauded vigorously. Chancellor Vincent, 
realizing that Professor Green, being deaf, could not hear the applause, 
suggested the waving of the handkerchief, which was done with great 
enthusiasm. For the first time Chautauquans beheld the effect which 
they have seen so often since, which resembles the blooming of thou- 
sands of white lilies. This salute is not only given at the various 
local Chautauquas, but at gatherings which have no connection with 
Chautauqua, and is known everywhere as the “Chautauqua salute.” 
CHAUTAUQUA NONSECTARIAN. 
Chautauqua is not denominational. Itis not under the control of the 
Methodist Church, or of any one religious body; but Chautauqua is pro- 
foundly religious. Eliminate that element, and its present earnestness 
would be gone. Chautauqua “is thoroughly nonsectarian, and mem- 
bers of all churches meet there on a common level of mutual respect 
and esteem. Religious differences are not emphasized by public dis- 
cussions, but are for the most part ignored. Every Sunday the sermon 
is preached by a man well known in his own church, and thus in a 
single summer a half dozen different denominations are represented. 
* * * Prof. J. P. Mahaffy, of Dublin, when he visited the assem- 
bly, said he expected to see ‘an ecclesiastical bear garden, but found 
instead a happy family.’” 
RELIGIOUS CLUBHOUSES. 
Thomas Jefferson first conceived the excellent idea of surrounding a 
nonsectarian university with different theological seminaries, each sup- 
ported by its own constituency and all profiting by friendly relations 
to the central institution. Something of this relation appears in the 
religious and social life of Chautauqua. Some of the leading denomi- 
nations have erected church clubhouses, containing attractive recep- 
   
-P-A-G-E-1043

tion and reading rooms, with various church -papers and other period- 
icals which clergymen and laymen often wish to consult. Here are 
- quiet rooms where one can write letters or meet friends. Receptions, 
reunions, and religious meetings are held in the comfortable parlors of 
these clubhouses, which are nicely furnished and are a source of par- 
donable pride to the different denominational subscribers or founders 
who erected them. All day long you will see people sitting on their 
elub piazzas, amid flowering plants, and evidently rejoicing under their 
own vines and fig trees, as did people at the World’s Fair in their own 
State buildings, or as do college boys upon the front porches of their 
fraternity houses. There is a commendable comity and generosity 
shown in the social and public use of these different denominational 
buildings, which are called by such names as “Presbyterian House,” 
“Methodist Episcopal House,” “Congregational House,” etc. Conven- 
tions of teachers and specialists of one sort or another are allowed to 
hold meetings and conferences in the parlors of these modern religious 
houses, which afford in some respects a striking contrast to medieval 
monasteries and to the old-time exclusiveness of church assembly 
rooms. 
CATHOLIC SERVICES. 
In the summer of 1895 a new feature was added to the religious life 
at Chautauqua. For along time a real need and actual demand had 
existed for the occasional services of a Catholic priest. Some of the 
students were Catholics. In Chautauqua households Catholic domes- 
tics have long been employed. Various religious denominations have 
been encouraged to establish their own places of social worship at 
Chautauqua, and there was no good reason for excluding Catholics, 
who have long been appreciative students of the Chautauqua system. 
Priests have occasionally visited the place, and have always found a 
welcome. 
Bishop Vincent invited the Catholic bishop at Buffalo to send a 
priest to Chautauqua to conduct services regularly once a week. This 
was done, and at each service a number of Protestants were present. 
Indeed, there was nothing in the character of the services that could 
possibly have offended any reverent Christian. But it was certainly 
a surprising evidence of the growing catholicity of Chautauqua to find 
in the Assembly Herald for Monday, August 5, 1895, the following 
item: 
“At 8 o'clock yesterday morning in College Hall about 50 persons 
assembled in attendance upon the first Catholic Church service held at 
Chautauqua. Low mass was celebrated, the service being conducted 
by the Rev. Father E. Gibbons, of Buffalo, N.Y. Among those pres- 
ent were several Protestants. Mass will be celebrated every Sunday 
morning during the season at the same hour.” 
College Hall has been used on week-day mornings for aripel exer. 
cises preliminary to the college class work, which begins at 8 welotis
-P-A-G-E-1044
  986 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Ministers, professors, and other laymen of various Protestant denomi- 
nations and different shades of belief have officiated on these occasions. 
Chautauquans have thus become accustomed to enlightened views of. 
religious worship and of all spiritual gifts. ‘For the body is not one 
member, but many,” said St.Paul. “Areallapostles? Are all prophets? 
Are all teachers?” (I Cor., xii, 14, 29.) It is a manifest tendency of 
our time-to give students the benefit of lay preaching as well as cler- 
ical, and to employ college preachers of different denominations. Har- 
vard, Cornell, and Chicago universities are conspicuous examples. But 
Chautauqua has excelled them all in true catholicity, for it has begun 
to bring Catholicism and Protestantism together upon common educa- 
tional ground, where they must finally meet, whether in school or uni- 
versity, and endeavor to agree in the spirit.of St. Augustine, who 
sought, “In essentials, unity; in nonessentials, liberty; in all things, 
charity.” 
The time may come when there will be a Catholic building at Chau- 
tauqua; butif there should be, it would probably be so broadly cath- 
_olic in character that any Protestant denomination could go inside and, 
if desirable, hold a service. Already at Chautauqua there is the 
Chapel of the Good Shepherd, owned by Episcopalians, which has 
never been formally consecrated or set apart for a specific mode of 
religious worship. The building may be used for educational or social 
purposes, or for religious services conducted according to other forms 
than the Episcopal. <A historical student is reminded of those good 
old times when English churches were used for town and parish meet- 
ings, and when Italian cathedrals were employed for public lectures 
and addresses. In the old university town of Heidelberg, Germany, 
there is a beautiful Gothic church, which has been divided by a parti- 
tion across the nave. On one side Protestants worship; on the other 
side Catholics. But the grand old church is one and the same church 
in spite of its partitions. 
HOW CHAUTAUQUANS LIVE. 
The majority of Chautauquans board in the cottages, some of which 
are large/and capable of accommodating many guests. The cost of 
living in a cottage is from $5 to $10 a week. At the Atheneum, the 
only hotel, the cost is from $12 to $25 a week. Many people rent cot- 
tages according to their means, and live in privacy and comfort. There 
are various gradations in the Chautauqua mode of life, from the prim- 
itive tent and light housekeeping up to a well-ordered summer house 
with family servants. Tents are now very rare, and are, indeed, rather 
distinguished by their rarity. 
The territorial domain of Chautauqua comprises over 200 acres. The 
northern portion is divided by numerous “avenues” into blocks of vary- 
ing size, containing each a number of cottage lots. Upon more than 
500 of these lots cottages have actually been built, and many lots have
-P-A-G-E-1045
  CHAUTAUQUA. 987 
been selected for building purposes. The usual size of a lot is 40 to 50 
feet front. The prices range from $150 to $500. It is not unusual for 
purchasers to take two adjoining lots and build in the center. 
Lots are not actually sold, but are leased for ninety-nine years. Ten- 
ants agree to conform to the by-laws of the assembly, to submit all 
buildings for approval by local authority, to use the property for pri- 
vate and not for business purposes, and not to sublet or transfer or lease 
land or cut down trees without permission. Thus communal rights 
remain paramount. The Chautauqua Assembly is the sovereign pro- 
prietor of the premises. Assembly authority is, however, asserted 
solely in the interest of the community. The proceeds arising from 
the sale of lots are devoted to the further improvement of the town. 
Plans for building, according to the means and taste of the tenant, are 
furnished free of charge by the assembly architect. 
Contracts for building are made with private parties. Simple cot- 
tages with two ground-floor rooms, a porch, and two’ chambers are 
built for $400. A cottage with a porch, parlor, dining room, kitchen, 
three chambers with closets, and an upper balcony costs about $700, 
A house with a veranda, hall, reception room, parlor, dining room, 
kitchen, pantry, four chambers with closets, a bath room, and a balcony 
ean be built for $1,800. A very charming combination is a simple 
cottage with a front pavilion of canvas and a wooden platform for 
a piazza. Bishop Vincent’s family and his son’s family live in such 
tent houses, which are the most tasteful and attractive upon the Chau- 
tauqua grounds, and combine the advantages of outdoor and indoor 
lifein summer. On fine, warm days people live on their porches and 
baleonies. At night and in rainy weather they withdraw into their 
inner rooms, where open fires are sometimes a great comfort and an 
unfailing source of good cheer. 
Sensible Americans are returning in the summer season to lives of 
greater ease, simplicity, and economy. Chautauqua cottages are more 
comfortable and more civilized than some costly camps in the back 
woods, or than noisy, pent-up lodgings in crowded summer hotels. 
The development of this really simple life, this civilized mode of return- 
ing to nature, has only fairly begun in America. We shall see more 
and more of it, for as the poet Sill said in his Field Notes: 
Life is a game the soul can play 
With fewer pieces than men say. 
POPULAR AMUSEMENTS AND RECREATION. 
There are many varieties of amusement and recreation at Chautau- 
qua. Best of all is the healthful open-air life. People spend their 
leisure outdoors, on lawns and piazzas, in the parks and groves, in 
friendly walks and talks. Most of the public or popular lectures are 
given to open-air assemblies, under roof indeed, but in buildings open 
to the breezes and to the light of day. There are few things at Chau-
-P-A-G-E-1046
  988 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
tauqua more beautiful than the sight of waving trees around the hall 
of philosophy in the grove. Something of the old Greek spirit has 
been consciously or unconsciously revived in the free, peripatetic, 
musical, athletic, out-of-door life of young people at Chautauqua. 
There is a good gymnasium by the lakeside. There, at nearly all 
hours of the day, classes and individuals are joyously engaged in phys- 
ical training under the direction of Dr. William G. Anderson, director 
of the Yale University gymnasium. Ever since Mr. Stagg was here Yale 
men have been coaching students at Chautauqua in athletic exercises, 
in baseball, rowing, and swimming. Match games are played by select 
Chautauqua nines, who usually beat the best teams from the whole 
countryside. At these games and‘at the boat races and swimming 
matches the entire juvenile population and many of the older people 
congregate and shout for Chautauqua and their favorites. Gymnastic 
exhibitions in the amphitheater attract great crowds, as in every col- 
lege community. There is no belief in asceticism at Chautauqua. 
The mortifying and lacerating of the human body are no longer 
approved in the enlightened Christian world. A man’s body is now 
regarded as his best friend and not as his worst enemy. By proper 
‘care and training the human form divine can be made, instead of an 
abode for demons of passion and disease, a living temple for the mind 
and soul. 
It would not be easy to find, in any of our college communities, such 
a fine place for an athletic exhibition under roof as the Chautauqua 
amphitheater affords when half the benches have been removed from 
the arena. In the midst of assembled thousands of spectators, com- 
fortably seated on benches, rising tier above tier, before such a cloud 
of witnesses the modern athlete might well imagine that the Greco- 
Roman games had been revived with their original environment. But 
what a vast difference in the spirit and character of the exercises! 
Instead of abnormally developed gladiators and those fierce and bloody 
contests of old Roman days we here behold symmetrically developed 
modern men engaged with generous rivalry in graceful gymnastic and 
athletic exercises which subserve not ignoble, cruel instincts, but the 
rational purposes of health and pleasure. 
Tennis courts abound at Chautauqua, and are filled with eager players 
allday long. There isa bicycle school where old and young are taught 
the modern art of swift and easy locomotion. Horseback riding and 
quiet driving content the more conservative classes. Perhaps the most 
popular of all amusements is boating. Every afternoon and evening 
dozens of light boats may be seen gliding over the peaceful surface of 
the lake with merry crews of all ages. Sailboats are in frequent use, 
but are not so popular. Many are the excursions by steamer up and 
down the lake, and many the barge parties and pleasant evening 
picnics at cool inlets along the shore.
-P-A-G-E-1047
  CHAUTAUQUA. 989 
Occasionally there are beautiful illuminations of the grounds and of 
the hotel piazzas. The Fourth of July, the first Tuesday evening in 
August, called “Old First Night”! (when Chautauqua used to open), 
and Recognition Day, the fourth Wednesday in August (when Chau- 
tauqua graduates receive their diplomas or certificates), are usually 
celebrated at night with fireworks. The “Feast of Lanterns” and the 
“Tiuminated Fleet” are always popular spectacles. Steamers, yachts, 
sailboats, and other craft are sometimes gorgeously arrayed with fes- 
toons of various colored lanterns, while brilliantly colored fires float 
upon the lake, and rockets and fire balloons add excitement to the 
charming scene. Prizes are awarded to the lake craft making the best 
display. ‘Athenian watch fires,” a favorite institution on gala nights, 
are brilliant but well-regulated flames of gas fiercely burning, high in 
the air, upon great iron torches. 
The old-fashioned spelling school has survived at Chautauqua. 
Prizes are announced in advance, and a large number of contestants 
come forward in the amphitheater and take benches facing a sympa- 
thetic Chautauqua audience. The spellers are grouped by States, and 
are usually arranged on two sides—for example, New York and the 
Middle States against the world. The director of the department of 
elocution gives out the words, which are carefully selected in advance. 
Rare or catch words are avoided, in order to make the contest really 
profitable and to prolong the excitement. Judges sit upon the plat- 
form with Webster’s, Worcester’s, and the Century dictionaries, to 
decide doubtful cases when appealed. Any way of spelling that has 
good authority is allowed. It is surprising to see the manifest pleasure 
of the audience at the continued success of certain boys, girls, or young 
ladies, or of favorite representatives of certain States or sections of 
country. Even more interesting and quite as profitable are the pro- 
nunciation matches, conducted upon the same general plan. 
The music and the singing at Chautauqua are delightful. In the 
morning hours, from the upper piazza of the hotel, the writer used to 
hear the great chorus class of several hundred voices in training, under 
a good leader, for some evening performance or for the next Sunday’s 
services. Public concerts, vocal and instrumental, are frequently given 
in the amphitheater, attracting thousands of delighted hearers. Violin 
players, professional singers, vocal soloists, quartets, and college glee 
clubs are invited to Chautauqua every season. Organ and orchestral 
concerts and piano recitals are well attended. Toward evening the 
band plays on the upper piazza at the Pier House, and hundreds of 
people enjoy this music in the open air. Some stroll about the grove 
and shady walks on Fair Point; some sit on the grassy slopes. of 
“Mount Carmel” and other hills of little ‘‘ Palestine,” on Chautauqua’s 
shore, while others row out upon the lake and hear the music across 
the water. It is all very pleasant to hear and contemplate if one has 
ia Chautauqua now begins on the last of June or first of J uly.
-P-A-G-E-1048
  990 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
learned to like his fellow-men and has discovered how much he himself 
resembles them. 
It is best to rise early at Chautauqua, for the morning there is the 
best part of the day for a quiet stroll about the hotel lawn and along 
the lake front. You of course buy an Assembly Herald from the first 
small boy you meet and read it at breakfast, where the local gossip and 
the reports of lectures generally create some amusement. In the Her- 
ald, or on bulletins conspicuously posted in the hotel and about the 
grounds, you read the programme for the day. Txperienced Chautau- 
quans mentally resolve what they will not hear and go at once about 
their morning’s work. Everybody who is really accomplishing anything 
at Chautauqua has entered some particular class or department, and 
has definite duties. My class in history met at the college at 8.30 a.m. 
An hour later I was free, and could do what I liked for the rest of the 
day. Usually I read or wrote throughout the morning; took a walk 
before dinner and a nap afterwards; perhaps an afternoon lecture at 
4 o’clock;.a swim at 5; supper at 6; a drive, stroll, or quiet row ina 
boat with pleasant company in the early evening; and later a look at, 
and perhaps. a seat in, the amphitheater, where with friends one is 
easily entertained by a popular lecture, a concert, a dramatic reading, 
or a stereopticon exhibition. Such amusements rarely last later than 
9.30, when people return to their cottages or to the hotel for further talk 
on piazzas until the chimes ring at 10 o’clock. Soon afterwards every- 
body is expected to retire or be quiet. All persons in rowboats must 
come in from the lake before that hour. Now and then a special dis- 
pensation is made in favor of some merry launch party or belated com- 
pany of guests. The police perambulate the grounds after 10.30, and 
do not encourage others to do so. Dr. Moulton, the extension lecturer, 
after working late one night, thought he would take a promenade 
around the grounds. He was halted by a policeman and had to explain 
himself. Of course there was no further objection in his case, but the 
law-abiding Englishman gave up strolling outdoors at midnight and 
began to walk in measured paces along the upper piazza of the hotel; 
but that nightly tramping disturbed the sleep of the guests, and the 
Englishman had to conform to the established rules, which are all very 
good and sensible. 
RULES AND REGULATIONS, 
The following is the substance of the by-laws governing the village 
of Chautauqua, which is a modern commune under as strict and as 
sensible communal regulations as were ever the parishes of Old or New 
England: 
1. All who become residents of Chautauqua, for however brief a time, 
must pay the fee or citizen tax fixed by the trustees, according to the 
length of the stay. 
2, All who refuse to conform to the rules or to pay the fee may be 
   
-P-A-G-E-1049
CHAUTAUQUA. 991 
excluded from the Chautauqua limits, and they can not reenter without 
the risk of criminal prosecution. 
3. No intoxicating liquors shall be sold or permitted to pass the town 
gates. 
4, Card playing, games of chance, and dancing are prohibited. 
5. Canvassing, distributing advertisements, peddling, etc., are for- 
bidden. 
6. No unnecessarily loud talking or the making of any noise is per- 
mitted between 10 p. m. and 7 a m. 
7. Building and other work of a disturbing or unsightly nature is 
not permitted from July 1 to the close of the season. 
8. Dogs are not permitted to run at large. 
9. On Sunday pleasure driving, boating, bathing, fishing, and games 
of all kinds are prohibited. No one is allowed to enter the grounds 
except in special cases (at the road gate only), when a permit is neces- 
sary. Persons may leave the grounds Sunday afternoon by the road 
gate after 4 o’clock. No boats call at the Chautauqua pier on Sunday. 
10. No meetings, readings, concerts, classes, or other public gather- 
ings are permitted in cottages or elsewhere other than those arranged 
for by the department of instruction. No business of any kind can be 
carried on without a license from the assembly. 
All of these rules and regulations have approved themselves by a 
thorough testing during an experience of twenty years. A brief sojourn 
at Chautauqua will demonstrate their good sense to an open-minded 
observer. In particular will he commend the laws against book agents, 
posters, peddlers, brawlers, stray dogs, Sunday excursionists, and other 
disturbers of the public peace. It is generally agreed that a wise con- 
servatism with reference to dancing and card playing is best for Chau- 
tauqua, for its managers and patrons do not wish to see the place 
converted into a summer resort for people who care merely for amuse- 
ment. Nor would liquor selling improve the character or patronage of 
this educational and social commune. People who care for these things 
can be accommodated elsewhere. The lakeis surrounded by fashionable 
hotels. 
GOVERNMENT OF CHAUTAUQUA. 
The commonwealth of Chautauqua is under a benevolent one-man 
power, that of the superintendent of the grounds. He is appointed by 
the 24 trustees of the Chautauqua Assembly, whom he serves also as 
secretary. All the ordinary functions of good local government are 
performed under Dr. Duncan’s efficient direction. I used to address 
him as “Mr. Mayor,” and he always responded to this title. He does 
away with all occasion for aldermen and a common council, and com- 
pines in his person all the necessary boards and commissions, such as 
public works, fire, water, health, and police. The board of education 
is under special management. Under his authority taxes, percent-
-P-A-G-E-1050
  992 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
ages, water rates, and other local charges are collected. By his 
orders the grounds are illuminated; the streets! are repaired, swept, 
and sprinkled; sanitary rules are carried out by all the cottagers; the 
water supply is regulated; the fire department kept in training; the 
mounted police sent hither and yon, on horseback or on bicycles; and 
gate keepers are instructed as to special duties. By his watchfulness 
and penetration Chautauqua is kept free from dangerous and suspi- 
cious characters. He sees that the rules and regulations of the little 
community are carried out and that all things are done decently and 
in order. He acts as marshal on public occasions, like Recognition 
Day. By his good government and practical management during the 
past ten years Chautauqua has become a business success and a 
model municipality. 
THE CITIZEN TAX. 
Taxation is the economic basis of civic society. Great privileges are 
enjoyed by all citizens of Chautauqua, and it is quite right that some 
payment should be exacted. Every visitor who enters the gates for 
one day in July is charged 25 cents. For this small fee he can hear all 
the public lectures, concerts, and entertainments that are advertised 
for that day. He can stay a week for $1; a month for $2.50. During 
the month of August the tax is higher, the attractions are greater, and 
so is the crowd. The daily tariff now becomes 40 cents, the weekly 
tariff is $2, and the monthly $3. But one can buy a ticket for the 
entire season for $5. These charges do not admit the visitor to any 
branch of class instruction, but only to the public courses and exercises 
that are posted from day to day on the printed bulletins. 
FOOD AND OTHER SUPPLIES. 
Chautauqua is fed from local markets. The neighboring farmers 
bring their milk, butter, cheese, fruit, and vegetables through the vil- 
lage gates and occupy convenient stalls where the cottagers come to. 
make purchases, exactly as townspeople go to market. There are local 
butchers, bakers, grocers, confectioners, and dealers in all desirable 
commodities for household use. The meat supply is brought from 
Chicago. During the July strike, when connections with the West 
were broken, Chautauqua had no fear of famine, for she could get a 
sufficient meat supply from her own neighborhood. 
Besides her own markets and provision stores, Chautauqua has a good 
bookstore, a drug store, soda fountains, various bazaars, a jeweler, an 
excellent optician, doctors, lawyers, ministers of all denominations, a 
millinery shop, a ladies’ tailor, a gentlemen’s furnishing store, a livery 
stable, public and private baths, and a barber shop. 
  
1The street cleaning of Chautauqua is especially well managed. Every Saturday 
afternoon all the avenues and streets are thoroughly cleaned. Men with shovels 
and carts make the rounds of the place and scrape up all dirt and litter. Nota 
scrap of waste paper is left in sight.
-P-A-G-E-1051
CHAUTAUQUA. 993 
WATER SUPPLY. 
The village of Chautauqua, like the great city of Chicago, gets a 
permanent water supply from an adjoining lake; but, unlike the 
metropolis of the West, does not poison its own well. An 8-inch sue- 
tion pipe is extended 600 feet out into Lake Chautauqua, which is fed 
from pure streams 700 feet above the level of Lake Erie. The entrance 
to this suction pipe is 40 feet below the surface of the water, and the 
supply is drawn in and forced some distance upward into a high sery- 
ice reservoir, from which the hotel and cottages are supplied by pipes. 
The water is pure and of excellent quality. No sickness has ever been 
occasioned by its use. : 
The reservoir lies among the hills back of the town, and when full is 
about 900 feet long, 300 feet wide in the broadest place, and about 22 
feet deep. Its estimated capacity is 10,000,000 gallons, This reservoir 
is filled for ten months in the year by a little stream which runs 
through the center of it, but in the summer months the brook sup- 
ply is increased by water forced from the lake by steam pumps, as 
above described. There is an upper dam by means of which, if neces- 
sary, the surface and storm water can be entirely excluded from the 
lower reservoir and carried around it by a waste pipe. Thus, if desira- 
ble, the reservoir can be entirely filled from the lake, while a good 
supply of water remains in the upper pond, ready for use at any 
moment in case of fire. These gravity waterworks have a head 175 
feet high. Connections with the water system are made at the cottage 
holder’s expense. The annual charge for the use of water and for 
sewer connections is $10. 
SEWERS. 
There are few towns or cities in this country so well provided with 
means for good drainage as is the academic village of Chautauqua. 
During the year 1893 there was introduced an extensive system of sew- 
ers 44 miles long, with disposal works costing nearly $41,000. Most 
towns are content with an inadequate system of drains and sewers 
emptying into some adjoining river or body of water, thus polluting 
the whole vicinity and perhaps the water supply of othe: towns. Chau- 
tauqua has adopted the English or Coventry process of treating chem- 
ically, with sulphate of alumina and milk of lime, the sewage as it flows 
out from the main. By means of settling vats and filter presses the 
whole mass, to the extent of 300,000 gallons daily, can be rendered inof- 
fensive. Itis separated into liquid and solid portions, the first running 
off as clear and odorless water, and the second appearing in the form 
of dry, hard cakes suited for removal and use in fertilizing land. The 
same remarkable results that the modern traveler sees accomplished 
for the sewage of the great cities of Europe he may see upon a smaller 
scale at Chautauqua. The application of chemistry and the filter press 
to the treatment of sewage is comparatively new in America, and some

of our city engineers and boards of health might profitably take a sum- 
mer course of instruction at Chautauqua with object lessons by the lake. 
FINANCES. 
The ways and means of supporting such a vast and complex insti- 
tution as the summer school at Chautauqua are interesting objects of 
inquiry. From the annual report of the secretary and superintendent 
of the grounds, presented at a meeting of the trustees held in Buffalo, 
N. Y., January 30, 1894, some interesting information may be derived. 
Although the year of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago and of the 
commercial panic was not favorable to Chautauqua, she enjoyed a total 
revenue of over $93,000. Of this amount, over $32,000 came from the 
sale of tickets of entrance to the grounds or for temporary sojourn, 
nearly $16,000 were so-called “O. L. 8. O. percentages,” nearly $8,000 
from Chautauqua privileges, and nearly $3,000 from other ‘“percent- 
ages.” The chief sources of income are, then, gate money, the profits of 
certain publications, local privileges, and local taxation. Ten per cent 
is collected from all persons who enjoy any money-making rights or 
economic privileges at Chautauqua. Every boarding-house keeper, 
storekeeper, market man, milkman, or ice-cream and pop-corn vender 
upon the premises pays his 10 percent. ‘There is a regular office where 
these percentages are paid and where a cash rebate of 2 per cent is 
allowed, thus securing prompt payments. 
The expenses for the general programme of the Chautauqua Assembly 
for 1893 were nearly $25,000. The cost of running the college of liberal 
arts was over $20,000, of which cost not one-fiftieth was covered by 
actual income from tuition. The general expenses of the Assembly 
for 1893 were over $24,000, not including legal expenses, interest, and 
repairs. 
Chautauqua has never been a money-making enterprise for the trus- 
tees. Indeed, it has always been more or less under a burden of debt 
until December 1, 1892, when it was virtually free. During the year of 
the Chicago Exposition the income was less than the expenditure by 
nearly $3,000, but the trustees of Chautauqua had such confidence in 
the future that they issued bonds to the amount of nearly $60,000 to 
pay for needed public improvements. 
The year 1893 was, however, not a good year financially. The pre- 
vious year was better. It appears from Secretary Duncan’s report, pub- 
lished in the Jamestown Journal January 24, 1893, that the total income 
of the Chautauqua Assembly for that year was over $120,000. The 
Chautauqua literary and scientific circles brought in nearly $17,000 and 
the college of liberal arts nearly $4,000. Altogether the revenue for 
1892 was $141,803.89. The sale of tickets that year yielded $56,396; 
C.L.S. C. percentages, $37,783; Chautauqua privileges, $8,038; per- 
centages, $5,099; sale of lots, $6,025; sundries, $6,932. 
The assembly outlay in 1892 for the general programme was $26,611;

for the college, $31,716; for incidental and legal expenses, $4,338; for 
repairs, $4,384; for general expenses, $23,206; for interest, $1,367. 
That year there was a profit of $29,288, but it was nearly all expended 
by direction of the trustees as follows: For improvements, $14,342; for 
the purchase of property, $3,016; for real estate, $1,877; for payment 
of Chautauqua debt, $10,000. Thus, in one year permanent improve- 
ments and additions of property were made to the amount of nearly 
$20,000, and the existing debt was entirely wiped out, with the exception 
of a mortgage of $3,500 on a tract of land recently purchased. 
Secretary Duncan’s report for 1892 shows that during the nine years 
of his ineumbency a total indebtedness of $90,000 had been liquidated, 
with $27,480 for interest, making the total payments for debts during 
that time $117,480. He expended for improvements during those nine 
years the sum of $183,323. 
Recent seasons at Chautauqua have been attended with financial 
success, and ws may expect to see the present bonded indebtedness 
extinguished at an early date and new improvements inaugurated. 
A summer assembly, with an income of $120,000 and with landed prop- 
erty rapidly increasing in value, may look forward with a reasonable 
hope to a prosperous future. There are many colleges and some 
universities that can not show annual revenues equal to those of 
Chautauqua. 
Part II.—HISTORICAL AND EDUCATIONAL. 
American summer schools of the Chautauqua type are historical 
evolutions of the Southern camp meeting. This latter institution was 
perhaps first suggested by the open-air life of hunters’ camps, but its 
first actual appearance was in 1799, on the banks of the Red River in 
Kentucky. This first camp meeting was made necessary by a remark- 
able overflow of religious enthusiasm resulting from the evangelistic 
work of two Scotch-Irish brothers named McGee, one a Presbyterian 
and the other a Methodist, supported by the Rev. Mr. McGreedy, a local 
Presbyterian pastor, whose church proved teo small to hold the gather- 
ing multitudes, Kentucky hunters and frontiersmen immediately mas- 
tered the situation by reverting to bivouacs and open-air meetings, such 
as Daniel Boone held under the great elm tree at Boonesboro. And 
thus on Red River a religious folkmote assembled day after day in the 
heart of the forest. In so doing these pioneers were unconsciously loyal 
to the religious as well as the democratic instincts of their Germanic 
forefathers. 
Popular education sprang from religious democracy in New England 
in the seventeenth century. A similar phenomenon greets the world in 
this nineteenth century educational evolution of the “general camp 
meeting.” It should be remembered that those open-air religious 
assemblies were called general because they embraced various denomi- 
nations, not alone Methodists, but also Baptists and Presbyterians, 
 
-P-A-G-E-1054
  996 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Like the first “great and general court” of Massachusetts, the “gen- 
eral camp meeting” was a democratic folkmote; in fact, more demo- 
cratic than any popular assembly in early New England outside of 
Plymouth and Rhode Island. While recognizing the larger toleration 
and the widening circles of popular education now represented in all 
parts of this country, we would call attention to that peculiar educa- 
tional democracy which has arisen from the Ohio Valley, where the cur- 
rents of Northern and Southern religious and intellectual life first met 
and mingled. 
The idea of utilizing the camp meeting for educational purposes, the 
thought of a “camp-meeting institute,” where methods of teaching 
should be cultivated, was suggested by Silas Farmer, the antiquary and 
historian, of Detroit, Mich., in the Sunday School Journal, as early as 
April, 1870; but a similar and perhaps larger idea was early cherished 
by Lewis Miller, of Akron, Ohio, the inventor of the Buckeye mower, 
which has revolutionized the farming machinery of America. This 
practically minded, large-hearted, and wealthy man, who all his life had 
been actively engaged in Sunday-school work, and who was one of the 
earliest and stanchest promoters of mechanical and agricultural educa- 
tion in Ohio, joined hands with Dr. (now Bishop) John H. Vincent for 
the improvement of Sunday-school teaching by a generous alliance with 
science and literature. Dr. Vincent, for many years a leader in Ameri- 
can Sunday-school work, believed most strongly in the increase of 
“week-day power” by the intimate association of secular and religious 
learning. He believed in the harmony of religion with everyday life. 
In the summer of 1873 the two men, Mr. Miler and Dr. Vincent, visited 
the Fourth Erie conference camp meeting! of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, held at Fair Point, on Lake Chautauqua, in southwestern New 
York. They chose that Fair Point for a local establishment of “The 
Chautauqua Sunday-School Assembly.” 
THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL ASSEMBLY. 
As an educational institution Chautauqua began in 1873 as a Sunday- 
school assembly for the training of teachers according to the normal 
methods. The next year it was determined to organize a permanent 
assembly for the encouragement of Sunday-school and allied work. A 
charter was secured from the State of New York. Twenty-four trustees 
or directors from various parts of the country were named. They were 
substantial men, sincerely interested in the proposed work. Prominent 
among them was Mr. Lewis Miller, who became the president, and the 
late Francis H. Root, of Buffalo. The latter was “one of the few men 
who attended every meeting of the board. In the days when it looked 
1The Chautauqua Assembly at Ottawa, Kans., still presents the camp-meeting 
type as did once the original Chautauqua. At Ottawa, where the assembly is held 
in a public park granted by the city, most of the people in attendance live in tents 
and fully 1,500 sleep on the ground. (Chautauqua Assemby Herald, August 9, 1894.)

dark for Chautauqua he was one of the few who put their names to the 
paper that gave us means, and who said this institution must live.” 
(Chautauqua Assembly Herald, August 21, 1893.) He was one of the 
eight men who erected the Atheneum. He gave his stock to the assem- 
bly, and remained to the last one of its stanchest supporters. 
Students at the college and members of the C. L. 8. C. and of the 
various classes sometimes forget the real founders of Chautauqua and 
the original character of its work. Atareunion of the Normal Alumni 
Association, August 17, 1893, Dr. J. L. Hurlbut said: 
“Tn the earlier days of the assembly the normal class was the great 
institution of Chautauqua, and was attended by many hundreds of 
people. At one examination at the close of the course there were 300 
persons who took the examinations required. * * * Now that 
Chautauqua assumes the wider work of general education, the normal 
course does not stand in quite the same prominence, yet the study of 
the Bible, with which Chautauqua began, is as thorough and as ear- 
nest as ever—more thorough and more earnest than ever. More people 
are studying the Bible now at Chautauqua than ever in those early 
days, and the normal classes of to-day, though not so large as they 
were when there were fewer interests at Chautauqua, are still large 
and still fall of enthusiasm.” 
At the same reunion Dr. B. T, Vincent said: 
“You members of the C. L. 8. C. are outcomes of the normal depart- 
ment. The normal class is peculiarly the one idea of the old Chautau- 
qua. Everything else that has grown up out of the Chautauqua 
movement has grown up outof this root idea, to make the people intel- 
ligent about the word of God and the works of God.” 
This characterization is worthy of historic attention, for it reveals 
the genesis of the whole Chautauqua system—Bible study, the appli- 
cation of normal methods to Sunday-school work, the popularization of 
these methods, the development of the international system of Sunday- 
school lessons, the infusion of a religious spirit into week-day work, the 
growth of the literary and scientific circle, and the final evolution of 
the college of liberal arts. It is interesting to notice not only the 
development but the vigorous survival at Chautauqua of the original 
normal and Sunday-school classes in their varied forms—the assembly 
Sunday school, often conducted in the amphitheater Sunday afternoon 
by its first president, Mr. Lewis Miller; the primary department, 
guided by Mrs. J. W. Ford,! at 9 a. m. in Kellogg Hall (a memorial 
building devoted to children’s education, the kindergarten, etc.); the 
Sunday school proper, at 9 a. m., under the direction of Dr. W. A. 
Dunean, secretary of the assembly, in the so-called “Temple”; the 
young people’s Bible class, often led at the same hour in the hall of 
' Mrs. Ford, of St. Louis, regards the primary and religious training of little chil- 
dren as the most important part of the work at Chautauqua, and regrets that people 
think so little about it.

998 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
philosophy by Mr. A. M. Martin, one of the secretaries of the C. L. 8. C.; 
the Society of Christian Ethies; the popular morning class for Bible 
study in the amphitheater, where Dr. William R. Harper, the principal 
of Chautauqua, attracts vast audiences by his enlightened exposition 
of the Old Testament, and, lastly, the flourishing week-day schools of 
sacred literature, where the Bible is studied in the original Hebrew 
and Greek and also in its English form, together with biblical history, 
under the direction of Principal Harper, aided by a staff of expert 
biblical teachers, like Profs. George S. Burroughs, D. A. McClenahan, 
W. W. Moore, Charles Horswell, and R. G. Moulton. 
“The Sunday-school nermal class for the training of Sunday-scheol 
teachers, both in biblical knowledge and in pedagogical principles,” 
still lives and thrives under the able and daily direetion of Dr. J. L. 
Hurlbut. But how wonderfully expanded has the whole work now 
become in the enlarged schools of sacred literature, which attract 
clergymen, theological students, and mature men and women, as well as 
young teachers and pupils. Through Dr. Harper’s institutes of sacred 
literature this higher educational work has pervaded the whole coun- 
try, and will foster more and more the enlightened and reverent study 
of the Bible. 
To understand the historical development of the modern Chautau- 
qua, with its many-sided educational and social features, we must 
never lose sight of its original democratic and religious foundations. 
Whatever may be the tendencies and aspirations, the variations and 
specializations of this popular educational experiment, the folkmote 
remains the basis of all. The Chautauqua Sunday-school assembly 
began its sessions on the first Tuesday evening in August, 1874, and 
that evening has continued to be the time for the regular “assembly 
opening,” although fully one month of educational work along seeular 
lines now precedes this memorable date in the Chautauqua calendar. 
The first distinctive objects of Chautauqua are inseparably connected 
with biblieal study in a Sunday-school normal institute. The early 
programmes of the assembly show a rich succession of lectures on prac- 
tical Sunday-school work and on the Bible, with conferences and dis- 
cussions on methods of teaching. Into the religious current came, in 
suecessive years, more and more tributary streams representing mod- 
ern science and literature in their relations to life and thought. One 
can distinetly trace in the reeords of Chautauqua the beginnings of all 
its modern educational tendencies, whether in pedagogics, art, social 
science, or the higher education. Map drawing, blackboard sketch- 
ing, the study of biblical geography in a great relief map of Palestine 
made of turf and stones, open-air talks, concerts, and even popular 
entertainments, were not absent from those early programmes. Promi- 
nent among the early features of Chautauqua were its wonderful catho- 
licity, its broad spirit of toleration, its democratic and widely repre- 
sentative character. From the very outset members of all the leading 
 
-P-A-G-E-1057
CHAUTAUQUA. 999 
Protestant churches joined in the work. Church congresses were held 
at Chautauqua and prominent clergymen from various denominations 
addressed the assemblies. Among the 600 students the very first year 
there were representatives from twenty-five States and from the prov- 
inces of Canada. 
THE GENERAL PROGRAMME. 
Before studying in any detail the educational work actually going 
on at Chautauqua the observer will be greatly aided by noting at the 
outset the distinction between the general programme and special-class 
courses of the college and various other schools. The original and still 
characteristic educational feature of Chautauqua for the passing vis- 
itor is the daily programme of public lectures, concerts, dramatic 
recitals, and other entertainments, to which everybody has access by 
virtue of paying for his ticket of admission to the grounds for one or 
more days. 
Bearing in mind the stranger who is within the gates for a single 
day, the management endeavors to offer a model daily programme 
throughout the season of nearly two months. Well-known lecturers 
are early engaged by the chancellor of the Chautauqua Assembly to 
give popular lectures upon attractive themes—religious, historical, 
biographical, social, and educational. While there is a growing tend- 
ency to increase the number of “connected, serious, and thought- 
compelling lectures, as opposed to more popular addresses,” stress is 
still wisely laid upon individual though related subjects, so that there 
may be a certain definite and finished character for each lecture in 
the public course. Very often outside specialists and professors from 
the Chautauqua college of liberal arts give to the public continuous 
courses upon the university extension plan, but the lecturers are always 
announced from day to day with fresh topics of general interest. 
What a generous, general programme is daily offered by the Chau- 
tauqua Assembly to its patrons may be seen from the following speci- 
men which appeared in the Chautauqua Herald for August 13, 1894. 
All these appointments were quite distinct from the special-class 
courses in progress during morning hours at the college, the teachers’ 
retreat, and elsewhere, for which special fees are paid. The criticism 
will undoubtedly be made that this bill of intellectual fare would cause 
indigestion, but it may be as easily replied that very few hungry people 
attempt to exhaust the entire menu at any good hotel table, and that it 
is easy for grown people as well as for children to be temperate in 
mental if not in physical ways. 
The daily bulletins are much simpler and less confusing than the 
following complete schedule, which serves as a reminder to all sorts of 
students and public workers. The general programme, with the

THE OC. L. 8S. C. 
In 1878, the fourth year of the Chautauqua experiment, which still 
retains all its original characteristics, the now famous CO. L. 8. C., or 
Chautauqua literary and scientific circles, began to widen from that 
beautiful highland lake all over the country. More than 60,000 stu- 
dents are now enrolled in these Chautauqua reading circles! They 
may be found not only throughout the United States and Canada, but 
in Great Britain, Russia, India, Japan, the Sandwich Islands, and 
South Africa. They are simply local unions, self-organized upon a 
1A good article on Gietuaas eee circles, by Dr. Haward Hiverett Hale, may

CHAUTAUQUA. 1001 
very democratic plan, for the purpose of reading good works of 
literature, science, and history under the central direction and guid- 
ance of Chautauqua. The members are for the most part persons 
past the school age. Many of them are graduates of local institutions 
seeking a broader outlook upon the world of knowledge. Very many 
are persons who have never enjoyed higher educational advantages. 
Although busily engaged in the employments of everyday life, they 
nevertheless crave some kind of intellectual and moral inspiration. 
Too many even of the more fortunate class who have enjoyed a school 
or college training sink into a local slough of despond in the years fol- 
lowing graduation. They revert to original ignorance, like the German 
peasantry after leaving the Volksschulen, or else they begin to subsist 
upon the husks of literature, as do the great masses of under-educated 
men and women. One of the very best features of the C. L. 8. ©. 
attempt to raise the educational level of ordinary society is the awak- 
ening of a generous and helpful spirit on the part of the better edu- 
cated, especially of college men and women, who are sometimes willing 
to review their former studies in readable English “by the side of less 
favored neighbors, giving them needed help in an unpretentious and 
unpatronizing way.” (Dr. Vincent, in the Chautauqua Movement, 
peti.) 
CHAUTAUQUA FOR THE PEOPLE. 
Chautauqua goes to the people when people can not come to Chau- 
tauqua. Thousands of readers who are unable to spend a summer 
season at Chautauqua Lake pursue from year to year the prescribed 
courses of private reading. The simple facts are eloquent. Since 1878, 
when the*first class was organized, 225,000 readers have joined. Every 
year 10,000 or more new readers are enrolled. There are at least 1,000 
local reading circles, miniature Chautauquas, where, year after year, 
systematic courses of private reading and class discussion are enthusi- 
astically maintained. The State of New York alone has more than 100 
Chautauqua local unions. The wholesome, quickening influences of 
these little neighborhood circles of organized intelligence upon the 
surrounding communities are not overstated by the friends of the 
Chautauqua movement. 
Not alone to neighborhood groups and to communities remote from 
Chautauqua does her uplifting power proceed, but also to isolated 
individuals and lonely toilers. ‘Many a frontier cabin, Southern plan- 
tation, ship on the seas, has felt the influence of the Chautauqua circle. 
Wherever there are earnest people who would make life more than dull 
routine or idle play Chautauqua is ready to go with a definite plan of 
reading, with specified books, with hints and suggestions, with a 
monthly magazine, and other means of stimulus and aid. Individual 
readers may join, even though there be no ‘circle’ in the community.” 
The strong hold which Chautauqua has upon individual students is 
indicated by the simple fact that in the exciting year of the Columbian 
ED 95——32*
-P-A-G-E-1060
1002 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Exposition more than 1,000 graduates of the four-years course in the 
C.L. S.C. continued their private reading under Chautauqua direction 
along more special lines. Such graduate individual work goes on for 
years. 
It is a good thing for isolated students or sluggish communities to 
have a well-managed course of prescribed reading. Any definite, 
well-considered plan is better than no plan. The main advantage of 
all school and college training comes from its methodic, regular charac- 
ter. There are doubtless many mistakes in the choice of teachers and 
text-books, but, in spite of mistakes and defective theories, the great 
process of human education is still going forward by courses of curric- 
ula far better than by spasmodic, jerky, capricious efforts. The same 
rinciples of method and continuity which guide all school and college 
training should be applied to higher popular education. In times past 
the Chautauqua counselors may not always have discovered the best 
text-books, but they did what they could, and perhaps they understood 
their popular constituency far better than did some educational crities 
and would-be advisers, who in satisfying their own high ideals, overshot 
the mark. 
THE GREATER CHAUTAUQUA. 
President Merrill E. Gates, of Amherst College, is a believer in the 
larger idea of Chautauqua pervading the home and neighborhood life 
of the American people by means of good reading in history, science, 
and literature. He says: 
“The true significance of the Chautauqua movement seems to me 
not to lie chiefly in the great summer gatherings, in the crowded lec- 
tures, the enthusiastic conferences, and the inspiring comméncement 
addresses at Chautauqua itself, nor in the diplomas awarded there. 
But the Chautauqua circles throughout the land mean useful, wisely 
directed home reading and intelligent general conversation in the home 
circle wherever their influence extends. Not only is it true that neigh- 
borhoods which have been stagnant for the lack of any common themes 
for conversation higher than the local gossip have been stirred to new 
intellectual life when the circles met to consider the facts of science or 
history and the noble thoughts and perfect forms of the best literature 
of all time, but in the home circle as well, in the family life of thou- 
sands of homes, children and parents have new themes brought into 
their horizon and talked about with a common interest at the table and 
in the evening. More than is yet realized has been done to purify and 
strengthen that intelligent, Christian home life which is the hope of 
our land.” 
CHAUTAUQUA A LIVING FORCE. 
The Chautauqua Assembly Herald, August 23, 1894, emphasized this 
point of view: 
“The recent social disturbances emphasize the need for greater and 
 
-P-A-G-E-1061
CHAUTAUQUA. 1003 
more widespread intelligence among the great body of the people. 
Among the beneficent developments of the past twenty years perhaps 
no movement has arisen which is destined to exert a wider or more 
healthful influence upon the public mind than that of the Chautauqua 
Literary and Scientific Circle. All over the land thousands of reading 
circles have, during the past sixteen years, carried on discussions upon 
historical, literary, and economic subjects, and their influence has been 
felt in stimulating other literary movements throughout the country, 
while the Chautauqua circle itself is only in the beginning of its use- 
fulness. The plan of the work for the current year is peculiarly attract- 
ive, as it deals not only with the growth of the English nation, but 
with the study of Europe in the nineteenth century, especially a timely 
subject in view of the stirring events which at present involve so many 
European nations. As is the case in every great movement, the power 
of the C. L. 8. C. may be indefinitely increased by adding to the num- 
ber of those who are willing to serve as leaders. Many young men and 
women have more of the quality of genuine leadership than they appre- 
ciate, and such are often surprised to find that a handful of earnest, 
determined students have almost without effort so added to their num- 
ber as to leaven the whole community. There are few persons who can 
not influence at least one other, and it is by this personal influence that 
power is to be generated which will in time revolutionize society. The 
C.L. 8. C. is a present living force and needs only a great number of 
active disseminators of that force to extend its influence through all 
classes of society. Ministers, teachers, and professional men and 
women of all classes are already enlisted in the work as helpers. But 
the field is wide and more are needed. Let all who are interested in 
the future welfare of the nation look carefully into this plan for the 
self-education of the multitudes.” 
THE CHAUTAUQUA CIRCLE. 
Let us now inquire exactly what Chautauqua proposes to accomplish 
for higher popular education and how she goes about her work. We 
quote from daily announcements in the Chautauqua Assembly Herald: 
“The 0. L. 8. C. (Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle) aims to 
promote habits of reading and study in history, literature, science, and 
art; to give college graduates a review of the college course; to secure 
for those whose educational privileges have been limited the college 
student’s general outlook upon the world and life, and to encourage 
close, connected, persistent thinking. 
‘A definite course covering four years. 
“ach year’s course complete in itself. 
“Specified volumes approved by the counselors. 
“ Allotment of time by the week and month. 
“A monthly magazine with additional readings and notes. 
“A membership book with review outlines and other aid. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1062
1004 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
“Individual readers may have all the privileges. 
“Local circles may be formed by three or more members. 
“Time required, about one hour daily for nine months. 
“Certificates granted to all who complete the course. 
“Seals to be affixed to the certificate are granted for collateral and 
advanced reading. 
“The OC, L. S. C. maintains that the higher education should be 
extended to all, young and old, rich and poor, and that education, best 
begun in academy, college, and university, is not confined to youth, but 
continues through the whole life. The circle is not in any sense a col- 
lege, either in its course of study or in its methods of work. Yet it 
puts into the homes of the people influences and ambitions which will 
lead many thousand youths to seek colleges and universities. The 
circle is unsectarian and unsectional, promoting fraternity and inspiring 
help to the home, the church, and the state. 
“The C. L. S. C. is for busy people who left school years ago, and 
who desire to pursue some systematic course of instruction. 
“Individuals may prosecute the studies of the ©. L. S. C. alone, but 
their efforts will be greatly facilitated by securing a local circle of two 
or more persons who agree to meet as frequently as possible, read 
together, converse on the subjects of study, arrange for occasional 
lectures by local talent, organize a library, a museum, a laboratory, ete. 
A local circle may give attention to the cultivation of taste, cleanliness, 
etc., in towns and villages, and discuss sanitary and other questions 
tending to public health and social progress. 
“Jt is for high-school and college graduates, for people who never 
entered either high school or college, for merchants, mechanics, appren- 
tices, mothers, busy housekeepers, farmer boys, shop girls, and for 
people of leisure and of wealth. 
“Many cultivated men and women, whose reading covers a wide field, 
keep up regularly the C. L. S. C. work, finding that this comprehensive 
review every four years gives to their other reading a value often lost to 
the unsystematic reader. Several members are over 80 years of age; 
comparatively few are under 18. 
“The circle has gradually secured a class of graduates (classes of 
1882-1895) who wish to pursue the current year’s course of reading with 
the undergraduates. 
‘An annual fee of 50 cents will entitle a graduate to all communica- 
tions from the central office for that year, including the 12-page memo- 
randa on the regular year’s reading. 
“Tn this way two seals can be earned— 
“(1) For reading the books of the regular course and filling out the 
regular 4-page memoranda, a special seal. 
““(2) For filling out the 12-page memoranda on the reading of the reg- 
ular course a white seal will be given if 80 per cent of the questions 
are correctly answered.
-P-A-G-E-1063

“The membership book contains duplicate sets of question papers, 
called memoranda. These are not examination papers, but are review

ing out of these memoranda is not essential to graduation. 
“The 4-page paper gives a brief condensed review of the whole course, 
and members who fill out this paper for each of the four years receive

THE FOUR-YEARS COURSE. 
General subjects of the four-years course.—1895-96: American history, 
literature, and institutions; beginnings of civilization — psychology. 
1896-97: French history—astronomy; oriental and Greek civilization. 
1897-98: German history—political economy; Roman history, litera- 
- ture,andart. 1898-99: English history, literature, and art; nineteenth 
century history—geology. 
Each year of the Chautauqua four-years reading course bears a dis- 
tinetive or characteristic name. 1894-95 is called the “English year,” 
because chief attention is paid to English history, English literature, 
and English composition. The subject of Europe in the nineteenth 
century has been wisely added to this course. Special attention is 
devoted by The Chautauquan (the organ of the C. L. 8. ©.) to articles 
on English and nineteenth century history, and a new department bas 
been added to the magazine, namely, a special study of current topics. 
THE COURSE FOR 1894-95. 
The prescribed reading for 1894-95 is as follows:

The total cost of books and the Chautauqua magazine is, therefore, 
$7. Considering the field covered and the excellent character of this 
educational material, one can not pronounce this charge excessive. 
Usually the cost is defrayed by a group of people who consent to use 
the same text-books. The importation of this choice collection of read- 
ing matter into a family circle or little neighborhood amounts to the 
institution of a library or book club, somewhat superior to the cheap 
novels and expensive subscription books which find their devious way 
into rural households.

1895 and closing in the early summer of 1896 will be: The first year for 
the class of 1899; the second year for the class of 1898; the third year 
for the class of 1897; the fourth year for the class of 1896.

0. L. 8S. 0. OFFICES, BUILDINGS, AND ORGANIZATION. 
The visitor at Chautauqua will find the busiest office work in progress 
at the new and attractive C. L. S.C. building. Here come students for 
programmes and information regarding classes and special courses of 
every sort. Some of the rooms of this building are used for class work 
and special conferences. Opposite the C. L. 8. ©. offices is the building 
devoted to the editorial and publishing departments of the Chautauqua 
Assembly Herald. Here may be found the various publications and 
text-books used in connection with the work of the C. L. S. C. 
In one quarter of the grounds may be seen class cottages and other 
buildings devoted to class rooms and reunions of the C. L.8.C. Con- 
siderable class spirit is developed in these vast reading circles scattered 
throughout the country. They have their mottoes, their colors, class 
badges, and class flowers. Through the columns of The Chautauquan, 
the monthly magazine devoted to the interests of the C.L. 8S. C., the - 
various classes are represented by personal letters and official commu- 
nications. During the summer season open-air conferences or so-called 
“round tables” are held in the hall of philosophy in the interest of 
the C. L.8. 0. 
When recognition day approaches, toward the last of August, class 
rallies become frequent, and a surprising enthusiasm is developed. 
Sometimes a large number of the earlier classes are present. It is cus- 
tomary from time to time to call the roll of all the classes, from the very 
first which graduated in 1882 down to the one which is in process of 
formation. There are class presidents, class secretaries, a general sec- 
retary, and an executive secretary, all of whom combine to promote 
class spirit and progress from year to year. The recruiting stations for 
the C. L. S. C. are the local Chautauquas (about 50 in number) and the 
round table conferences, at which well-known speakers represent and 
encourage the Chautauqua idea. 
The best source of information regarding the character and usefulness 
of the C. L. S. C. work may be found in the annual reports (published 
in the Chautauqua Assembly Herald) by Miss Kate F. Kimball, who has 
been for some years the executive secretary and practical leader of this 
deservedly popular educational work. Miss Kimball is the author of a 
bright remark, quoted at Chautauqua by a Smith College graduate as 
the cause of her own conversion to “0. L. S. C. ism,” and recommended 
to all other college graduates: “The C. L. 8S. C. is the best thing to 
keep your background fresh.” 
Miss Kimball, the sister of'a Johns Hopkins physicist, now professor 
in Amherst College, is at the head of a large staff of clever and efficient 
young women at the central office of the C. L. 8S. C. at Buffalo, N. Y.
-P-A-G-E-1066
1008 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The passing visitor will find that office the scene of busy correspond- 
ence with Chautauqua pupils who are scattered throughout the world. 
From this center circulars of instruction and directions for study are 
distributed, and to this center all reports of progress are returned. 
The methods of classifying and preserving the records of Chautauqua 
work are businesslike and suggestive of good administration. At the 
central office may be seen a full set of the outlines for various courses 
of study in connection with the C. L. 8. C. 
CIRCULATION AND USE OF BOOKS. 
At the fourteenth anniversary of the founding of the Chautauqua 
Literary and Scientific Circle, August 6, 1892, Principal J. C. Hurlbut 
said: 
“The Chautauqua Circle has aided in the circulation of good books. 
If the man who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew 
before is a benefactor of the world, what shall we say of him who is 
able to put one good book in the hand of a reader? The Chautau- 
, gua Circle has circulated something like an average of 30,000 sets of 
books every year, or near that amount, and sometimes, indeed, more, 
and in some years perhaps a little less; but that number would per- 
haps be the average figure. In fourteen years 30,000 sets would be 
about 180,000 volumes per annum, and in fourteen years it would come 
to nearly 2,000,000 copies of good books that have been circulated 
under the auspices of the Chautauqua Cirele. It is something to have 
put one good book into the hand of a reader. It is more to have 
put 2,000,000 good books into the hands of the people; and that is 
something which nobody can gainsay the Chautauqua Circle has 
accomplished. 
“They are books that would not have been circulated, and very nearly 
all of them would not have been written, if it had not been for the 
Chautauqua Circle. I remember when the first order was sent from 
Chautauqua for the first book in the C. L. 8. C. course. A telegram 
was sent to the great firm of Harper Bros., in New York, asking them 
to send to Chautauqua 300 copies of Green’s Short History of the Eng- 
lish People. They thought some wonderful mistake had been made; 
that it was probably 3 copies that were needed, or at the outside 30, 
They were almost paralyzed at the order—that an institution sup- 
posed to be something of a camp meeting should send for 300 such 
books at one time. The 300 grew to thousands before the class of the 
first year had finished its readings. These books have been circulated, 
and a great many books are in libraries that would not otherwise have 
gone. Many books in libraries are allowed to become dusty with age, 
and a great many are put away on center tables and opened about 
once a year. These books of the Chautauqua Circle—2,000,000 of 
them—have been read during the last fourteen years.

CHAUTAUQUA. 1009 
“Tf you should go among the homes of the people who purchased 
them you would find them, not on the upper shelf, or the shelf that is 
locked up, or in the case which no one can open, but you would find 
them on the shelf where people can get at them, find copies lying on 
the sewing tables of women, upon the counter, or in some other conven- 
ient place accessible to the clerk in the store. More than that, you 
would find that these books have been read. There are very few books 
circulating in large numbers but in a very little while they also, in very 
large numbers, come back to second-hand bookstores—in two or three 
years after the book has been published and perhaps widely circulated. 
If you go into our second-hand bookstores you can always find a large 
number of copies of such books. Iam one of those people who spend 
much time in second-hand bookstores looking for books, and sometimes 
seeking some particular work; and I have rarely found copies of the 
books issued under the auspices of the Chautauqua Circle in such 
places. Those books have been kept, they have been read, and bear 
the signs of use; been read over and over again, and sometimes passed 
from hand to hand; and if you go to the homes in this country you 
will see the shelf of Chautauqua books, the nucleus of a library. It 
has done more than circulate books; it has led people to read, led 
people to think as the result of reading. 
“You can not read a book of power without its having some sort of 
influence upon your character. I read the lives of eminent men and 
find how often a book, at some critical period in their history, has given 
abent to their nature and their entire after life. A man, of science 
happened in his youth to pick up some scientific work, and had his 
attention and thought turned to that line afterwards, which began with 
the reading of that book. A man read some book upon religion, upon 
the relation of man with God, and became an honest living Christian 
as a result of it. So we find all over the world that books influence 
character. What has been the influence of the Chautauqua books 
upen those who have read them? If you were to obtain their testi- 
mony, you would find they will tell you with surprising unanimity that 
not only their minds have been enlarged, not only has the world of 
thought in which they live been widened, but their hearts have been 
lifted up, their characters have been strengthened, they have become 
the better because of this institution which was established fourteen 
years ago on this very place. I believe there is a direct result of the 
Chautauqua Circle that not many people realize, although many peo- 
ple feel it. Here is a father and mother who have been reading the 
books of this course together. It has given them something to think 
about. It has lifted up their minds, and as a result in the family the 
themes of conversation around the table and around the fireside are 
thoughtful and intelligent themes. They talk about the heroes of the 
past; they talk about the principles of science, and the sons and daugh- 
ters and others in the family receive an impetus and inspiration toward
-P-A-G-E-1068
  1010 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
education. And I believe if you could go through the colleges of 
America to-day, East and West, you would find many students there 
who, through the influence of their parents, received their first shaping 
toward the intellectual life from the Chautauqua Circle.” 
DR. J. G. FITCH ON READING CIRCLES. 
A competent judge of educational matters, Dr. J. G. Fitch, Her Maj- 
esty’s chief inspector of the training colleges of England, and author 
of Lectures on Teaching, said to an audience of 5,000 people at Chau- 
tauqua, August 7, 1888, on the opening night of the assembly: 
“One feature of your work specially interests me. I mean the serv- 
ice which your reading circles render to remote students, who have not 
access to great libraries nor to great teachers, to colleges, or to univer- 
sities, but who in silence and at a distance from these opportunities 
are nevertheless trying, with God’s help, to improve their minds and to 
get something of the treasures of wisdom that lie enshrined in books. 
Ido not think that any of us have adequately realized the great change 
that is going on in the intellectual life of Europe and of this country 
through the multiplication of cheap books. I do not think that we 
have ever rightly appreciated the wealth that there is in books, and 
the power there is by which they may do what universities and oral 
teaching were once the only means of doing. * * * It seems to me 
that you have hit upon one of the most admirable and fruitful devices 
ever yet adopted when, by means of reading circles and correspondence 
helps, the solitary student has opened to him what he shall read and 
what use he shall make of his reading when he has it. This is a great 
work on which you have often invoked the divine blessing. * * * I 
earnestly trust that it may continue to go on and prosper, that this - 
great assembly may be one of the most notable agencies by which you 
may encourage the love of truth, the devotion to knowledge, and the 
help and guidance of the people of America.” 
CHAUTAUQUA AND GREEK CULTURE. 
in these days, when not a few college men are turning away from 
classical to modern studies, it is gratifying to find the Chautauqua lit- 
erary circles still directing attention to old Greece. Of the seven 
books required for the Greek year in 1888-89, three related to the his- 
tory and literature of Hellas. The Chautauquan magazine, which has 
a circulation of nearly 70,000 copies, announced for its readers in the 
C. L. S. C. a series of nine articles on Greek biography by Prof. T. D. 
Seymour, of Yale University, and a number of papers on modern 
Greece by J. P. Mahaffy, of Dublin; also sketches of Greek art and 
archxology, with some account of physical training and the position of 
women among the Greeks. In a special or graduate course of private 
reading in connection with the four-years course in the ©, L. S. ©, it
-P-A-G-E-1069
  CHAUTAUQUA. 1011 
is interesting to note Mahaffy’s Old Greek Education. This entertain- 
ing little volume it is well to read with Chautauqua in mind, and some 
may have the curiosity to examine the Outline History of Greece, pro- 
posed for the C.L.8.C. It gives one a curious feeling toward these little 
books to think that they are the means by which a knowledge of Greek 
civilization and Greek culture is transmitted to thousands of eager 
minds in our great modern democracy. Is this knowledge superficial? 
So is all knowledge. American education hardly scratches the surface 
of things either in school or college. The ancient Egyptians, we are 
told, obtained very good crops of grain without plowing in the fertile 
mud left by an inundation of the Nile. American pioneers have raised 
a great deal of wheat in their rough way from the virgin soil of forest 
clearings. ‘ Behold the sower went forth to sow.” Some seeds fell by 
the wayside, others upon rocky places, others among thorns, but still 
others upon good ground and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold. “He 
that hath ears, let him hear.” 
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL CIRCLES. 
Perhaps a few of the following suggestions may, prove helpful in the 
foundation and management of local reading circles in this country. 
Most, if not all, of the points have been derived from actual knowledge of 
and experience with Chautauqua circles. The general secretary, Mr. 
A. M. Martin, has collated fifty such points in the “Chautauqua Pocket 
Manual. Local circles; how to organize and how to conduct them. 
Office of the C. L. S. C., Buffalo.” At Chautauqua the present writer 
saw, after it had been to the World’s Fair, a scrapbook full of original 
manuscript or typewritten programmes, representative of the work of 
these local reading circles scattered throughout the land. The variety, 
originality, suggestiveness, and educational interest of these pro- 
grammes, invented by the people and for the people, were really mar- 
velous. They surpassed most systems of theoretical pedagogies, and 
show what vital powers of educational self-help are now springing up 
in America. 
(1) A local circle is an organized meeting for mutual improvement. 
It may be formed of any number from 3 to 20, It should hold regular 
meetings, weekly and fortnightly, to review the subjects and encourage 
members in daily reading. 
(2) A simple organization is the best. All the officers needed are a 
president, a secretary and treasurer, and an instruction or executive 
committee to plan the work in advance and arrange the programmes 
for class meetings. 
(3) Circles should meet in the church lecture room, or in the school- 
house, or in Y. M. ©. A. parlors, or wherever good accommodations can 
be freely obtained. 
(4) Occasional public meetings should be held in the church or town 
hall, and. general invitations issued to hear a lecture by some person
-P-A-G-E-1070
1012 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
not a member of the circle. Social receptions and literary, musical, or 
art exhibitions may also be held. 
(5) At all local meetings the minutes should be read, the roll should 
be called, and reports of progress asked from each member. 
(6) Ten or fifteen minutes should be devoted by the president or 
class leader to general drill. Questions should be asked upon the class 
reading in such a way as to bring out concisely the pivotal points of 
the lesson. : 
(7) Questions left unanswered at the previous meeting should be 
revived and settled. 
(8) Debate should be encouraged. It is well to appoint leaders or 
disputants on each side of a mooted question and to limit the time of ° 
each speaker to a few minutes. 
(9) A competitive question exercise is sometimes profitable. Two 
appointed leaders should choose sides and ask questions alternately, on 
the required reading, of the persons on the opposite side. A record of 
the questions answered or missed by each side affords all the interest 
of an old-fashioned spelling school. 
(10) Put questions to the whole circle which shall awaken serious 
thought and bring out a series of good replies, which may be formulated 
by the secretary for class use or reference. 
(11) Require the members in turn to give each an interesting fact 
noted in connection with the reading under discussion, and continue 
the exercise until each person has had five opportunities to contribute 
to the general stock of knowledge. 
(12) Listen to résumés of the whole matter by appointed members, 
or to essays or short talks upon special subjects. 
(15) Require some one to write upon the blackboard an analysis, 
synopsis, or outline of the topics considered at each meeting. 
(14) Receive from members questions for investigation and report at 
the next meeting. 
(15) Make use of written questions, carefully prepared in advance by 
the leader or by appointed members for testing the knowledge of the 
class. The questions may be drawn or distributed, and answers given 
orally or in writing. 
(16) Hold “round tables,” or conferences, for the general improve- 
ment of thecirele. Here helpful suggestions may be introduced. Here 
special topics and historical characters can be discussed. Here the 
meaning and pronunciation of words should be explained. Here all 
practical difficulties are presented and mooted questions solved. 
(17) Select readings from general literature bearing on the subjects 
in hand may be introduced. 
(18) Imaginary tours through the countries and cities studied will 
awaken great interest if accompanied by maps, photographs, or lan- 
tern views, with picturesque descriptions of travel from entertaining 
authors. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1071
CHAUTAUQUA. 1013 
(19) Declamations, readings, recitations, and brief extracts from prose 
or poetry relating to subjects that interest the class will prove very 
stimulating. 
(20) Vocal or instrumental music, solos, duets, quartets, choruses, or 
amateur orchestras will enliven and entertain the circle. Home talent 
should always be developed or pressed into social service. 
(21) Utilize all available local talent. Secure for the circle helpful 
and relevant lectures by clergymen, physicians, lawyers, teachers, col- 
lege graduates, and passing visitors. Try to preserve as far as possible 
the unity of work undertaken by the reading circle and do not let it 
degenerate into a “variety show.” 
(22) Encourage local history in the “American year.” Have papers 
upon local topics. Publish them, if approved, in local newspapers. 
Keep scrapbooks of such local contributions. 
(23) Begin, or help develop, a museum in connection with a town or 
local library. Collect rare old books, portraits, prints, maps, manu- 
scripts, historic letters, or records. Cultivate local pride and interest 
in historic places and old traditions. Mark historic sites or buildings 
with simple memorial tablets. 
(24) Identity the circle with the higher intellectual, moral, and social 
interests of the community. A little group of public-spirited Chau- 
tauquans may uplift a whole neighborhood, promote village improve- 
ment, good taste, neatness, sanitation, in short, the public health and 
welfare, in countless ways. 
(25) Do not neglect contemporary history and the progress of the 
outside world. An occasional synopsis or digest of current events 
will help to make members more alert and intelligent in the reading of 
newspapers and magazines. 
(26) Make excursions to battlefields and other historic places. Visit 
museums, libraries, art galleries, and public buildings whenever an 
opportunity is afforded. Report what you have seen to your circle and 
stimulate others to use their powers of observation in travel or visitation. 
(27) Keep records of all meetings. Preserve the history of your own 
circle and all its doings. Make the journal of each evening so interest- 
ing that members shall delight to hear it read at the opening of the 
next meeting. 
A JEWISH BRANCH. 
One of the most novel developments of Chautauqua C. L. S.C. work 
was the establishment of a Jewish branch in 1893 by Rabbi Henry 
Berkowitz, of Philadelphia. The origin of this new and interesting 
movement is described by Rabbi Berkowitz in an interview published 
in the Chautauqua Assembly Herald August 4, 1893. He said the 
work started with a lecture given by himself in the Rodef Sholom 
congregation at Philadelphia. He there urged self-culture along Chau- 
tauqua lines. As a result the Young People’s Society of his congre-
-P-A-G-E-1072
  1014 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-95. 
gation issued a call which resulted, April 18, 1893, in the appointment 
of a joint committee from the various Jewish societies of the city. By 
means of this committee an organization for the encouragement of 
Jewish self-culture was effected. Later, at the suggestion of Rabbi 
Berkowitz, who had been in correspondence with Chancellor Vincent, 
the organization was placed upon a C, L. 8. C. basis. It was thought 
wise to profit by the long experience and existing methods of Chautau- 
qua and to adopt her four-years course of reading, with some modifi- 
cations to meet the special needs of Jewish students. Two new courses 
were added: (1) Jewish history and literature, and (2) readings in 
Jewish literature. The first and more advanced course was prepared 
by the learned rabbi, Prof. Richard J. H. Gottheil, of Columbia College, 
who has delighted Chautauqua audiences by his liberal views. His 
syllabus of instruction is very suggestive, and was used by the writer 
for review purposes in connection with a collegiate class course in Jewish 
history at the Johns Hopkins University. A popular course of reading 
in Jewish literature was also instituted for the “Young Folks’ Reading 
Union,” after the model of the Chautauqua Young Folks’ Course. 
While the local headquarters of this new educational work among 
the Jews is at Philadelphia, enroilments are reported to the central 
C.L. 8. C. office at Buffalo. Jewish members receive the C. L. S.C. 
membership book and all other official communications. In Miss Kim- 
ball’s report, published in the Chautauqua Assembly Herald August 
23, 1894, is the following statement from Dr. Berkowitz: “We have 
enrolled some three hundred members, and a great many are following 
the readings who are not regularly enrolled. One hundred and forty- 
seven of these members belong to the general C. L. 8. C. course, the 
others to the two special courses. The membership extends throughout 
14 States of the Union and 15 circles have been reported from various 
cities and towns. The membership includes persons of the most diverse 
callings in life, and the courses of reading are found to be suited to the 
needs and tastes of readers from 20 to 70 years of age. * * * This 
has been a year of planting. The promise of the harvest in the future 
is excellent.” 
More recent reports show that this Jewish work has been extended 
through 18 States and that the membership has reached about 500. 
The work has kindled great enthusiasm not only among earnest- 
minded Israelites who have been encouraged by the Jewish press and 
pulpit, but also among Christian Chautauquans. 
There are now special courses in Jewish history and literature coy- 
ering the entire range of these subjects from Bible times to the present. 
Very elaborate syllabi of instruction and of recommended readings 
have been prepared by Professor Gottheil, of Columbia College, who 
has based his outlines upon Graetz’s famous History of the Jews, a 
work now published in English by the Jewish Publication Society of 
America.

  CHAUTAUQUA. 1015 
A Young Folks’ Reading Union was organized for the encourage- 
ment of home study by Miss Diana Hirschler, of Philadelphia. The 
object of the union is to foster an interest in Jewish history and liteta- 
ture. Among the books required for the first year are the Outlines of 
Jewish History, by Lady Magnus; Stories from the Rabbis, by Dr. A. 
8. Isaacs; and The Hammer, a Story of the Maccabees, by A. J. 
Church. Other good books are recommended. 
An enrollment fee of 25 cents is required from each member. <A leaf- 
let of instruction is then issued, arranged for eight months and out- 
lining the course of study, with suggestions for semiweekly mectings 
in local reading circles. The leading features of the Chautauqua sys- 
tem have been adopted, including the custom of sending memoranda 
to the central office in answer to specific questions. A certificate is 
given to all who complete the two-years course. 
Thus the example and influence of Chautauqua have made them- 
selves felt for good in the encouragement of higher popular education 
among the oldest historic people of the world. This fact is paralleled 
by the institution of a Catholic Chautauqua along precisely the same 
lines as the original C. L. 8. C., including the summer school. This 
Catholic movement will be described under Part II of this report. 
PRISON WORK. 
For many years the work of the Chautauqua literary and scientific 
circles has been faithfully carried on in the prisons of Stillwater, Minn., 
and of Lincoln, Nebr. The Look Forward Circle of this latter place 
began the Chautauqua year 1893-94 with 60 members, of whom 32 were 
new accessions, 14 had read one year, 11 had read twoyears, 2 three years, 
and i had received his certificate asa graduate. Of this persistent Chau- 
tanquan a correspondent in Lincoln writes to Miss Kimball, secretary 
of the executive committee: “He is a remarkable man, though he has 
had few opportunities for education. He has from the outset applied 
liimself most diligently, and at the class exercises has shown himself 
thoroughly prepared and his ambition and carnestness have exceeded 
anything I have seen even in other circles.” Miss Kimball says the 
prison circle has had the aid and cooperation of professors from the 
Nebraska State University and others who have made the programmes 
interesting and helpful. ‘The Prison Reform Club, which is the out- 
growth of this circle work, is composed of a few Lincoln Chautauquans 
who have shown their genuine interest in the Look Forward Circle 
by helping those who are discharged from prison to enter fields of 
honorable employment and to make them feel that they have friends 
who are really interested in their welfare. The Pierian Circle at Still- 
water, Minn., publishes each week in the Prison Mirror reports of the 
circle meetings and papers written by the men. * * * During the 
year more than thirty papers written by members were published in 
the Mirror, and all of these show thought and care, and many of them

decided originality.” (Miss Kimball’s report for 1893-94, published in 
the Assembly Herald August 22, 1894.) 
LANIER AND THE CLASS OF 1898, 
Miss Kimball, in her report of the growth and progress of the Chau- 
tanqua Literary and Scientific Circle for 1894-95, says: 
“While the distractions due to the World’s Fair and to the prevailing 
financial depression were not without their influence upon the member- 
ship of the C. L. S. C., the circle has been quick also to feel the impulse 
of better times, and this has been strikingly shown during the past 
year in the increased membership of the new class of 1898, which 
exceeded that of 1897 by more than 2,000 students. arly in the 
summer of 1894 a request came from one of the Southern Chautau- 
quas that the class might be named in honor of the two Southern 
poets, Sidney and Clifford Lanier. The suggestion was very gladly 
accepted, and the class adopted as its motto a line from a poem of 
Clifford Lanier, ‘The humblest life that lives may be divine’ <A 
decided increase in the membership of the C. L. 8. C. in the far South, 
especially in Alabama, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, is 
pleasant evidence of the appreciation in which the name of Lanier is 
held. In certain other portions of the country also the gain in mem- 
bership has been unusually large. Illinois, Connecticut, Kansas, and 
Oregon have a larger enrollment than for several years past. In New 
York, always a strong State, the gain has been much greater in pro- 
portion than usual, while in foreign lands the membership is nearly 
double that of last year. The subjects of study for the year, English 
and nineteenth century history, proved very attractive, and this 
fact, together with the activity of State and county ‘secretaries and 
©. L. S. C. workers in all parts of the country, awakened widespread 
interest.” 
GRADUATE COURSES FOR THE OC. L. 8. C. 
A remarkable and encouraging fact in the C. L. 8. C. work is that so 
many of its graduates continue their studies after completing a four- 
years course and receiving their certificates. For the year 1888-89 
Miss Kimball, the secretary, reported that one-tenth of the whole pre- 
vious graduate constituency of Chautauqua had been pursuing various 
lines of work under the direction of their alma mater. Some were 
taking the new and improved courses of the C. L. 8. C. Some were 
uniting in graduate circles for special and advanced work in history, 
literature, or science, and some were working alone, but still under 
Chautauqua direction. 
“These graduate circles,” says Miss Kimball, “stand as the perma- 
nent representatives of the Chautauqua movement in hundreds of com- 
munities.” It is the declared purpose of the C. L. 8. 0. “to develop 
each year some one special course of study to which the attention of 
all graduates shall be directed for that year. Facilities for advanced 
 
-P-A-G-E-1075
CHAUTAUQUA. 1017 
work and a limited amount of personal direction from able instructors 
will be one feature of these special courses, in order that graduates may 
keep ever in mind the high attainments which are possible to them. 
By this means the unity of the graduates’ work will be largely 
increased, although circles having special preferences in any one line 
of work will still be at liberty, as heretofore, to make their own selec- 
tion of courses.” Special recognition in the form of “seals” or certifi- 
cates are given for this extra work. A combined course in English 
history and English, prepared for Chautauqua graduates by college 
professors, has proved very attractive and helpful. A new course on 
modern European history, to be studied by means of standard authori- 
ties with a syllabus of topics and suggestions, was prepared in 1895 by 
Dr. H. B. Adams and G. B. Lynes, of Johns Hopkins University. 
Special attention is directed to current history in the magazine called 
The Chautauquan, by Mr. Ned Arden Flood, son of Dr, Theodore L, 
Flood, the editor. A new course in foreign travel through England 
has been devised by Miss Susan Hale, of Boston. The student will, by 
the aid of good literature and pictures, maps, etc., take an imaginary 
journey through the most interesting historical places of our mother 
country. ; 
Among the special or “séal” courses of reading designed for grad- 
uates and others are the following: (1) General history; (2) English 
history and literature; (3) oriental history and literature; (4) Greek 
history and literature; (5) Latin history and literature; (6) Ameri- 
can history and literature; (7) modern history; (8) political science; 
(9) geography and travel; (10) biblical literature; (11) secular normal 
course for teachers; (12) astronomy; (13) geology; (14) chemistry; (15) 
microscopy; (16) botany; (17) zoology; (18) physics, two courses; (19) 
psychology; (20) philology; (21) art; (22) the house and home; (23) tem- 
perance; (24) missions; (25) Sunday-school normal; (26) advanced nor- 
mal; (27) physiology; (28) the Bible; (29) Shakespeare; (30) French 
history and literature; (31) stories of the nations; (32) agriculture; (33) 
anthropology. 
Each course is accompanied with a kind of suggestive syllabus of 
topics or questions, upon which answers or so-called “‘memoranda” are 
written. Many of these helpful outlines and topical arrangements for 
private study were prepared by experts, and are excellent guides for 
individual students or classes who are compelled to work at a distance 
from any established institution of learning. The scheme of study in 
anthropology, prepared by Dr. Frederick Starr, of the Deere of 
Chicago, is particularly good. 
GRADUATE WORK AT PORTAGE, WIS. 
In her report of the C. L. 8. C. for 1888-89, Miss Kimball, the exec- 
utive secretary, describes a remarkable educational experiment under- 
taken by Chautauqua graduates in Portage, Wis. In that busy
-P-A-G-E-1076
1018 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
manufacturing town a distinct circle was organized for a comprehen- 
sive study of Germany, its geography, history, biography, literature, 
and art. ‘Topics for study were carefully arranged in advance and 
printed upon a leaflet, with lists of desirable books of reference. A 
course of stereopticon lectures was suggested as an aid to study, and 
almost unawares the society found itself carrying out a broad educa- 
tional scheme which embraced a large portion of the intelligent part of 
the community. The opera house was secured for a course of lectures, 
a stereopticon and slides were rented, and all available local talent— 
clergymen, lawyers, and teachers of the city—pressed into service as 
lecturers. Season tickets were sold at $1 each, entitling the holder to 
20 lectures, illustrated by from 20 to 50 views, at an expense of 5 
cents for each lecture. Single tickets were sold at 50 cents each, and, 
though the expense of the course amounted to nearly $400, the circle 
closed the season free of debt. Increased interest in the lectures was 
manifested as the season advanced, and many weary and burdened 
men and women came to look forward to the lecture evening as the one 
bright spot in their lives. The influence upon the community was very 
marked, and the members of the circle were so encouraged by their suc- 
cess that a similar plan for the study of the British Isles was suggested 
for the next year. The undergraduate cirele worked heartily with their 
comrades in pushing the enterprise, at the same time keeping up their 
regular meetings, while the graduates met once a week and studied up 
the topic for the coming lecture.” 
GRADUATE MEMBERSHIP IN 1895, 
Writing in August, 1895, Miss Kimball said: 
“The graduate membership of the C. L. 8. C. now exceeds 35,000, 
and, while many of these have naturally drifted into other lines of work, 
a large number are interested in the C. L. 8S. C. special courses, and in 
many communities graduate circles exert a wholesome influence in edu- 
cational affairs.” : 
CHAUTAUQUA EXTENSION AND THE C. L. 8. CG. 
A remarkable adaptation of university extension methods to the local 
work of the Chautauqua literary and scientific circles is described by 
Miss Kate F. Kimball in her report for 1892-93 (see Chautauqua 
Assembly Herald, August 24, 1893): ; 
“A new phase of C. L. 8. C. work was intreduced during the winter 
of 1892-93 as a sort of experiment in the general line of university 
extension, although disclaiming entirely so ambitious a title. 
“The modified plan, known as the ‘Chautauqua extension,’ did not 
originate in America, having been first attempted in Great Britain, 
without, however, resulting in the same degree of success which has 
been accorded to it here. The details of the plan as carried out during 
the winter of 1892-93 by the Chautauqua Circle included a single course 
of six lectures on Greek social life, prepared by Prof. Owen Seaman. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1077
CHAUTAUQUA. 1019 
The lectures were a modification of a similar course which Professor 
“Seaman had delivered at Chautauqua with great acceptability during 
the summer of 1892. Each lecture was printed separately in large, 
clear type, the course including the following topies: 
“1. Introductory. 
“2. Religious beliefs and ritual. 
“3, Home life—Dress—Status of women. 
“4. Marriage customs—Rites of burial—The great games. 
“5, The games (continued)—The theater. 
“6, The slave question—Publie life—Conclusion. 
“Any community proposing to give the course of lectures was pro- 
vided with as many announcements for general distribution as were 
desired, course tickets to be sold at 50 cents each, and a 16-page syl- 
labus for every ticket holder. The syllabus contained a full outline of 
each of the 6 lectures, a list of recommended books, a set of questions 
to be used as a quiz, and several illustrations to elucidate the character 
of the Greek dress as set forth in one of the lectures. 
“ By this arrangement as many as possible of the essential features 
of the university extension idea were carried out—namely, the lectures 
and syllabus prepared by a university extension lecturer, and oppor- 
tunities for a quiz and an examination. The only essential feature 
which was lacking was that of the personal presence of the lecturer 
himself, and it was the elimination of this feature which made it possi- 
ble for many small communities to reap the advantages of the univer- 
sity extension idea in other respects. The expense of the course was 
so adjusted that no community undertaking the scheme incurred any 
‘financial risk. One-half of the gross receipts from the sale of course 
tickets at 50 cents each (the whole amount in no ease to exceed $25) 
was all that was required by the Chautauqua office. This arrangement 
made it possible for a small community which could not sell more than 
20 tickets to give the course in a parlor, incur no expense whatever, 
and seeure a fund of $5 for the purchase of books, maps, or other helps 
of value to a reading circle. 
“Nearly 70 courses were given, and it is interesting to note the 
practical workings of the plan. The problem of a lecturer was solved in 
various ways, according to the opportunities offered by the community. 
“Pastors and high-school principals gladly gave their services, and 
in one town the professors in the theological seminary presented the 
lectures. In Denver, Colo., a professor at the State University took 
charge of the course, a large number of tickets were sold, and the eir- 
cles were able to secure the use of a lantern and of a rare collection of 
Greek views. A home-missionary circle in Connecticut gave the lec- 
tures as a parlor course, and netted $12.50 for the desired object. Ina 
town in southern New Jersey the lectures were given in the parlors of 
a hotel, and with such success that application was made for 30 exami- 
nation papers.
-P-A-G-E-1078
  1020 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
“From a town in New York State, where the lectures were delivered 
in the Congregational Church, the pastor sent an interesting report. 
He wrote: ‘We have given three of the lectures in the Chautauqua 
extension course, which was inaugurated by the West Side C. L. 8. C., 
and it has been a source of gratification that we have found 70 who 
would purchase course tickets, Our city can barely sustain a popular 
lecture course once in three or four years. This kind of work, if con- 
tinued, will furnish a constituency for that, as well as for university 
extension. We have two papers read each evening from the questions 
in the syllabus of the preceding lecture, and our hour is voted all too 
brief.’ In a town in Ohio, where men and women of special ability were 
invited to conduct the quiz, this part of the lecture is reported as espe- 
cially valuable and interesting. One more report will show how the plan 
was carried out in a large city church in Pennsylvania. The report 
came from the pastor of the church, who was the leader of the circle: 
‘I write to let you know of the great profit and enjoyment afforded the 
Whittier Circle of the 0. L. S. ©. by the lectures on Greek social life. 
The lectures themselves are written in popular vein, and, while showing 
research and familiarity with the subject, are such as the ordinary out- 
sider enjoys, while to the Chautauquan in this Greek year they area 
delight. Last evening our programme consisted of music, lecture third 
on Greek costume and domestic life, followed by a most interesting 
quiz, not of the audience, but of a local artist who goodnaturedly con- 
sented to answer any question we might thrust at him concerning Greek 
costumes or modern dress as related to art in sculpture or in painting, 
A very lively half hour spent in the exercise brought to a close a most 
interesting and helpful evening. We congratulate you upon the whole 
plan of these lectures, and hope that the system may be extended.’ 
“The plan was not confined to a limited area, but was tested in no 
Jess than 27 States, in communities numbering from a few hundred 
to many thousand inhabitants, and has proved: itself capable of filling 
so real a need that additional courses have been arranged for the season 
of 1893-94, These will include, in addition to the course on Greek life, 
6 lectures on the poetry of Robert Browning by Prof. Owen Seaman, 6 
lectures on social science by Prof. A. W. Small, of the University of 
Chicago; 3 lectures on great periods of medieval history and art by 
Prof. William H. Goodyear, of the Brooklyn Institute, and 6 lectures 
by President William R. Harper, of the University of Chicago, on 
prophesies concerning the fall of Jerusalem. The whole plan fits in 
admirably with the C. L. 8. C. courses of reading, since non-Chautau- 
quans can be induced to take up a part or all of the C. L. 8S. C. course 
as a preparation for the lectures, while regular C. L. 8. C. students find 
that the course admirably supplements their work.” 
In her report of progress for 1894-95 Miss Kimball says: 
“The Chautauqua system of ‘read lectures’ has been continued with 
marked success during this, its third year. Nearly 40 courses were
-P-A-G-E-1079
  CHAUTAUQUA. 1021 
given in as many cities and towns. The social science lectures proved, 
as usual, the most popular of the series. The pastor of a Congrega- 
tional church in Wisconsin wrote of this course: ‘The lectures have 
been a great help to me, and I believe a great help to my people. I 
can not commend them too highly; they have enlisted a good deal of 
interest, and my church has been crowded.’ 
“Tn Paterson, N. J., the literary committee of the Epworth League, in 
cooperation with the church organization, gave the course with great 
success. The pastor of the church wrote: ‘The course is producing a 
marked impression” Under the auspices of a Congregational church 
in Pittsfield, Mass., the course was given during the winter with an 
attendance of nearly 100. The lectures were so much appreciated that 
they were also utilized by a workingman’s club in connection with a 
factory district. A social science club of 19 men took the 6 lectures as 
the basis of their winter’s study and discussion. In addition to this 
series, courses on great periods of medieval history and art and on 
the poetry of Robert Browning have found an appreciative hearing. 
A club of high-school teachers in Minnesota used the lectures for club 
work instead of giving them as a regular course. In New Hampshire 
a company of ladies belonging.to a magazine club used first the course 
on Greek social life and met with so much success that they followed 
it with the social science lectures. The members of the club came 
together from quite widely scattered country homes, and in spite of 
inclement weather the interest was maintained to the close, and papers 
showing much careful thought were presented by several members. In 
Montana the Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian ministers are com- 
bining their churches and people in the interest of social science, and 
the “Friends in Council” of Berlin, Wis., write that the Browning course 
has given great pleasure as well as profit. Churches, clubrooms, and 
private parlors have been utilized, and many different organizations 
have tried the plan on a greater or less scale. The New Century Club, 
of Utica, N. Y., used the social science course for a group of 20. A 
similar number took the course under the auspices of a political equal- 
ity club in Iowa. The Doane College Y. M.C. A., in Nebraska, had an 
average attendance of 60. In Lancaster, Pa., the course was given in 
the interest of a proposed club for studies in municipal government. 
Other courses were given by Chautauqua circles, Epworth leagues, or 
under general church auspices. The plan seems to possess great possi- 
bilities, and other courses will undoubtedly be added in the near future.” 
OPINIONS OF THE C. L. 8. C. 
[Principal A. M. Fairbairn, of Mansfield College, Oxford, England.] 
The C. L. 8S. C. movement seems to me the most admirable and effi- 
cient organization for the direction of reading and, in the best sense, for 
popular instruction. To direct the reading during a period of years 
for so many thousands is to affect not only their present culture but to
-P-A-G-E-1080
  1022 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
increase their intelleetual activity for the period of their natural lives, 
and thus, among other things, greatly to add to the range of their 
enjoyment. It appears to me that a system which can ereate such 
excellent results merits the most cordial praise from all lovers of man. 
[Rev. Dr. Jesso L. Hurlbut, of New York.] 
The ©. L. 8. C. leads each of its members tu read the equivalent of 
15 books of 300 pages each every year, or 60 volumes in four years. 
Any institution which leads a great multitude of people each year to 
read this amount of good, thoughtful, uplifting literature has brought 
an invaluable blessing to the age. 
[President W. R. Harper, of the University of Chicago.] 
I think there can be but one opinion regarding the influence of the 
C. L. 8. C. movement. It seems to me the most powerful and far-reach- 
ing of the popular educational forces of this country. It stands alone, 
and must everywhere be acknowledged to be an admirable agency for 
general culture among all thinking classes throughout the land. 
[John Fiske.] 
Ihave always been very heartily in sympathy with the movement. 
It brings certain people in relations with the literary and scientific 
world which they could not possibly maintain without such assistance. 
As a stimulating and suggestive agency toward mental eulture I regard 
it as admirable, and I am convinced it has not been equaled by any 
other system of popular education. 
[Hamilton W. Mabie, editor of the Outlook.] 
The characteristic which distinguishes the American who has not 
enjoyed the advantages of a high intellectual training from men of his 
class in Europe is his aspiration, This must be wonderfully stimulated 
by an educational agency so comprehensive as the ©. L. S.C. It is, in 
my opinion, am exceedingly efficient force for directing intellectual sys- 
tem in planning one’s life. 
[Prof. Albert S. Cook, Yale University.] 
No agency for the diffusion of education among adults is so effeetive, 
in my judgment, as is the C.L.S.C©. There is no one beyond its reach, 
and few, in proportion, are they who would not be helped by following 
the course. 
COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS. 
The highest development of Chautauqua is seen in her College of 
Liberal Arts. This institution stands upon the highest land of her 
broad domain of 225 acres. It is a breezy summerhouse built in a 
Moorish style of architecture, and looks out upon Chautauqua Lake 
and the charming hillside landscape beyond. The site is a veritable 
acropolis for natural beauty.  
-P-A-G-E-1081
CHAUTAUQUA. 1023 
The interior of the college building is simple and unfinished except 
with a library, an open fireplace, chairs, and long tables. The plain 
class rooms, with their desks and blackboards, are good enough for 
summer work. The long door-like windows open directly from the 
ground floor upon the piazzas, and the students never complain of bad 
air, as they often do in American colleges and German universities. 
The Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts is a historical outgrowth 
of the Normal School of Languages, first opened in 1879, the same 
year as the teachers’ retreat. At first each school of language was 
independent of all the rest, but they are now coordinated with other 
subjects into one institution, embracing various special departments, 
with professors borrowed from the various colleges and universities. 
For example, in the summer of 1894 the schocls were organized as 
follows: : 
1. English language and literature. (Profs. A. S. Cook, of Yale, and 
R. G. Moulton, of Chicago.) —Courses were given in July and August 
of 1894 in Old English (5 hours a week), Tennyson (5), Browning 
(5), with interpretive studies in Spencer and Milton (5). For many 
years the English department at Chautauqua was most suecessfully 
conducted by Prof. W. D. McClintock, a former pupil of Professor 
Cook at the Johns Hopkins University. They are both experienced 
Chautauquans. 
2. German language and literature. (Prof. Henry Cohn, of the Chi- 
eago School of Languages.)—Various elasses were well conducted: 
Beginning German (10 hours), intermediate German (10), advanced 
German (5), six German lectures on Faust, scientific German for 
advanced students. A German club was maintained for conversation, 
singing, and dramatic entertainment. A German table was provided 
at one of the cottages. The whole department impressed me as very 
efficient and well directed. Under such excellent guidance a faithful 
student could make wonderful progress in German in six weeks. 
3. French language and literature. (Prof. A. de Rougemont, Adel- 
phi Academy, Brocklyn.)—Beginning French (10 hours), intermediate 
French, advanced French (with French composition), Cercle Francais 
(outdoor class for French conversation), French lectures. Long expe- 
rience at Chautauqua has tested and approved this practical and schol- 
arly work. 
4. Preparatory Latin, (Prof. F. J. Miller, University of Chicago.)— 
Beginning Latin (10 hours a week by the inductive method), Virgil 
(5), teachers’ advanced training course (5 hours, with sight reading 
and topical studies of syntax). Professor Miller is an experienced 
Chautauquan, and is very successful in his methods of work, which 
eombine the best features of construction and analysis. 
5. Preparatory Greek. (Prof. W. E. Waters, University of Cincin- 
nati, president of Wells College, ‘Aurora, N. Y.)—Beginning Greek (10 
hours a week, inductive method), Anabasis (10). :
-P-A-G-E-1082
1024 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-95. 
6. Physics. (Prof. J. H. Montgomery, Allegheny College.)—General 
physics (3-hour lectures, with laboratory work), electricity (2). 
7. Chemistry. (Prof. L. H. Batchelder, Hamline University, St. 
Paul, Minn.)—Systematic chemistry (10, lectures with Remsen’s intro- 
duction), qualitative analysis (10), quantitative analysis, organic chem- 
istry (text-book, Remsen). 
8. Geology—For many years this department has been most suc- 
cessfully conducted by Prof. Frederick Starr, of the University of 
Chicago, the eminent specialist and experienced lecturer in anthropol- 
ogy. In the summer of 1894 his place was taken by Miss Anna A. 
Schryver, of the Teachers’ College, New York. 
9, Biology. (Dr. H. P. Johnson, Des Moines College.)—Elementary 
zoology (10), advanced zoology (10). 
10, Mathematics. (Prof. William Hoover, Ohio University, Athens, 
Ohio.)—Algebra (5 hours), geometry (5), trigonometry (5), analytical 
geometry (5), differential calculus (5), astronomy (5). 
11. History and political science. . (Profs. George B. Adams, Yale; 
H. B, Adams, Johns Hopkins; H. E. von Holst, Chicago, and Bernard 
Moses, California).—Outlines of mediwval history (5 hours for 3 weeks, 
G. B. Adams, with 5 public lectures on English colonization and 
empire), history of Prussia (5 hours for 3 weeks, H. B. Adams, with 
5 public lectures on political revolutions of the nineteenth century), 
history of France during the restoration (5 hours for 3 weeks, H. E. 
von Holst, with 2 public lectures on “Utopia” and “Should the United 
States Senate be abolished?”) principles of polities (5 hours for 3 
weeks), and Spanish economic and political administration in America 
(5 hours for 3 weeks, B. Moses, with public lectures on South Amer- 
ican history and other subjects). The above work, collectively, was 
called the “Specialized department for 1894,” and represents an earnest 
attempt on the part of the college to promote class work as well as 
popular interest in the allied subjects of history and polities. 
12, Economics and social science. (Profs. R. T. Ely, University of 
Wisconsin; J. R. Commons, University of Indiana; C. R. Henderson 
and George E. Vincent, both of University of Chicago.)—Money (5 
hours for three weeks, R. T. Ely, with 6 public lectures on private prop- 
erty), political economy (5 hours for 3 weeks, J. R. Commons), intro- 
duction to the study of society (5 hours for 6 weeks, G. E. Vincent), 
social pathology and its place in general sociology (4 hours for 3 weeks, 
©. R. Henderson, with public lectures upon social problems). 
The reader of this condensed programme will doubtless be surprised 
at the extent, character, and variety of the class courses offered at 
Chautauqua during the six-weeks summer séason. The classes in 
English and the modern languages are the largest. The classics also 
draw a good number of students and are very helpful to teachers and

request special collections of books are now loaned to Chautauqua 
from the State library in Albany by the board of regents, who are fos- 
tering local lectures by lending so-called “traveling libraries,” each in 
its own bookease. At Chautauqua in one season there were such 
special loan collections of books for the study of French history, United 
States history, political economy, and English literature. 
In addition to the regular class work the departments of literature, 
history and politics, and economies and social science always offer to the 
Chautauqua public short courses of popular lectures, very often upon 
the same general themes as are treated in class rooms at the college. 
This policy helps to defray the cost of college lecturers by charging 
their public services to the general programme of the assembly, and it 
also helps to increase and strengthen the college classes and gives 
their work and lecturers a healthy popularity. If college professors 
everywhere could be thus utilized occasionally for public purposes, it 
would benefit them personally and undéubtedly improve the character 
of their class instruction, for oftentimes the public standard of excel- 
lence is higher than the professor’s private standard in the class room. 
The Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts is not and never can be a 
financial success. It will always need aid and support from the Gen- 
eral Assembly, but the college is doing work at once honorable and 
helpful to the larger Chautauqua. The college has greatly improved 
the general tone of the place, and has given better methods and greater 
continuity to the more popular forms of instruction in the hall of philos- 
ophy and the great amphitheater. A higher standard of public enter- 
tainment has become necessary, and even the Sunday-school work feels 
the stimulus of acknowledged leaders like Dr. Harper and his corps of 
assistants from the college world. Chautauqua is now developing new 
life in its original field of instruction. 
The cost of tuition in any one department at the college is $5 for the 
summer session. No student is allowed to take studies in more than 
two departments without special permission from the principal. His- 
tory and political science count as one department, and so do economics 
and social science. 
It should be distinctly understood that the College of Liberal Arts 
is quite distinct from the Chautauqua literary and scientific circles and 
from the teachers’ retreat. The province of the latter is to teach edu- 
cational methods. The C. L. 8. C. attempts to give a general outlook 
upon the world of literature and science by means of systematic courses 
of reading in English. The college is a long step forward from these 
beginnings. The college has introduced classical and other linguistic 
courses, including French and German. The reading circles are still 
under general direction through correspondence with a central secre- 
tary. The college has distinct departments, each under individual 
direction. In the local circles intellectual stimulus comes from the 
contact of members and from joint discussion, as well as from private 
ED 95 33

reading. In the college there is direct contact between special students 
and individual instructors in lecture or laboratory courses during the 
summer session of six weeks. Afterwards, if the student desires it, 
there is careful supervision of home studies along specific lines by 
means of correspondence, written reports, or examinations at least once 
a month. 
SPECIALIZED DEPARTMENTS. 
Chautauqua has always laid particular stress upon biblical studies, 
teaching, and lectures, and ancient and modern languages. In recent 
years special attention has been given to history, politics, economies, and 
English literature. In the summer of 1894 representatives were engaged 
from the historical departments of the following universities: Califor- 
nia, Chicago, Yale, and Johns Hopkins; and earnest efforts were made 
by the management to give the study of European and American his- 
tory a prominent place in the Ghautauqua system. 
‘Whatever may have been the practical results at the summer school, 
it is now clearly manifest that history is the prevailing element in most 
of the Chautauqua reading courses, and rightly so, for history repre- 
sents the real life and experience of mankind. Matthew Arnold omit- 
ted the most vital element of human culture when he defined it as a 
knowledge of the best that has been thought and said in the world. 
He should have added the best that has been done. It is not thinking 
and saying merely; it is doing that makes culture possible and life 
worth living. History is the knowledge of man’s deeds. “Be ye doers 
of the word, not hearers only.” 
Next in importance to law and religion and other forms of historical 
and political science, upon which all good government and the very 
life of society depend, come literature, art, and natural geience. Chau- 
tauqua has rightly given more prominence in her system of popular 
culture to historical, intellectual, and religious things than to material 
nature. This is the way in which mankind has made progress out of 
savagery, and along this ancient pathway of law, religion, philosophy, 
and letters every new generation of man must walk. Man has con- 
quered nature by his deeds, his works, and his inventions, but he is 
always seeking new worlds to conquer in the domain of ideas, of art, 
literature, and science. The true, the beautiful, and the good are 
gradually revealed to him in fields of observation, expression, and 
conduct. 
It will be a long time before first-rate, popular work can be done in 
natural science except, perhaps, in summer laboratories by the seaside, 
but Chautauqua has made good beginnings in observational study. It 
has provided modest, inexpensive laboratories for physics, geology, 
chemistry, and biology. Very superior instruction in the historical 
science of anthropology has been given at Chautauqua by Professor 
Starr, now of the University of Chicago.
-P-A-G-E-1085
  CHAUTAUQUA. 1027 
By far the best specialized department at Chautauqua is that of Eng- 
lish literature. Begun years ago in scholarly but popular ways by 
Prof. Albert S. Cook (before his connection with Johns Hopkins, Cali- 
fornia, and Yale universities), developed by his Hopkins pupil, Prof. 
W. D. McClintock, it reached in the summer of 1895 its highest suc- 
cess. The combination of special talent then brought together for 
teaching English, one of the noblest studies in the world, is indicated 
by the following names, which speak for themselves to those who know: 
Professor Cook, of Yale; Professor Winchester, of Middletown, Conn.; 
Professors Moulton and Lewis, of the University of Chicago, and Pro- 
fessor Sherman, of the University of Nebraska.

THE SEASON OF 1895. 
The sessions of the Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts closed in the 
open air with, as Chancellor Vincent said, the benediction of the sun- 
shine upon it. The season of study here was marked by two most 
encouraging features. The attendance has been greater than ever 
before, and the earnestness and willingness to work shown by the stu- 
dents have won the warm approval of every teacher. Of the 2,000 
pupils at work here this season in all departments of the college and 
special schools, 451 were in the College of Liberal Arts. They were dis- 
tributed among the different departments as follows: English, 130; 
German, 84; Latin, 72; French, 67; Greek, 31; mathematics, 30; art 
history, 20; chemistry, 10; sociology, 10; physics, 9; American his- 
tory, 10; biology, 9; philosophy, 2,and general, 25. The largest enroll-

Buchtel, Bethany, Rollins, Beloit, and Mount Holyoke colleges, and 
the Womaw’s College of Baltimore. 
Fifty-two of those in attendance studied in other summer schools in 
former years, 99 were college graduates, and 32 have taken a second 
degree; 53 were graduates of normal schools, 23 were members of 
the Chautauqua Correspondence College, and 40 were members of the 
0. L..8. 0. 
CORRESPONDENCE SYSTEM. 
The correspondence system of college teaching is based on (1) printed 
instructions sent out by the department in which the student has 
chosen to work, (2) on skillfully constructed examination papers which 
test the student’s understanding of what he may have read, and (3) on 
written answers or reports sent in to the department at least once a 
month and then carefully corrected and returned to the student. The 
system develops independence of character, habits of investigation 
and self-help, and the power of accurate and exact statement on the 
part of the pupil. It necessarily involves thoroughness of preparation 
and complete command of the entire month’s work, which has covered 
the ground of what would ordinarily occupy many recitations in a class. 
Class work, although undoubtedly superior, has its evils, as every col- 
lege student well knows. ‘The oral recitation is hurried and covers for 
each individual only a narrow range of knowledge. In large classes 
students are infrequently called up, and when they have recited they 
sometimes become inattentive and take a long mental rest before begin- 
ning to calculate the probabilities of another call. Itis usually thought 
by students and instructors that written examinations are, on the 
whole, the best and fairest all-round test of a man’s ability and attain- 
ments. Such severe trials of the knowledge of the pupil and of the 
patience of the teacher are these written examinations that they are 
not generally resorted to more than once or twice a term; in fact, under 
the old college régime only once a year, in the dreaded “annuals.” It 
should be remembered that the correspondence system requires at least
-P-A-G-E-1088
  1030 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
monthly written examinations from October to June. These are rarely 
if ever taken by persons who have shirked their duty, who have 
crammed and cribbed for a special test, or who are disposed to cheat in 
the absence of a proctor. Correspondence students are generally per- 
sons of mature years, who are very much in earnest, and who have 
studied for self-improvement or a genuine love of the subject rather 
than for a diploma or for class rank. 
Of course the correspondence system is no adequate substitute for 
the constant drill, perfect regularity, personal supervision, suggestive 
power, active stimulus, and generous rivalry of class-room work in the 
very sight and hearing of a vigorous and enthusiastic instructor day 
after day and throughout four years. No sane man would ever think 
of advocating education by correspondence as superior to education by 
contact. It is for the very sake of establishing personal relations 
between master and pupil, between the individual and society, that the 
summer session of the Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts was devised. 
Although a six-weeks course of lectures and of class work seems very 
trifling as compared with the thirty-six or more weeks of the college 
year, it should be remembered that one college lecture or one sermon is 
sometimes enough to determine a life choice. If a college professor 
can sometimes strike sparks of intellectual light in fifty minutes, he 
ought to be able to kindle some sort of a fire in a course extending 
from three to six weeks. If a man’s scientific career, like that of Prof. 
Joseph Henry, once secretary of the Smithsonian, is sometimes deter- 
mined by the reading of a single book, “although by no means a pro- 
found work,” as he himself admitted, it is possible that the suggestion 
of a course of good reading for an earnest student at Chautauqua may 
bear rich fruit in coming years. Many a university student in Ger- 
many, England, and America will admit that the best results of a pro- 
fessor’s teaching are introductions to special literature and to new 
vistas of scientific interest. Many a doctor of philosophy, returning 
from years of foreign note taking, has left his voluminous notebooks 
unused and has sought fresh knowledge and inspiration in books reeom- 
mended by his professors or in more recent literature. 
Finally, it should be borne in mind that the Chautauqua correspond- 
ence system is designed for those and for those only who, by the force 
of circumstances, are prevented from attending a regular college. As 
Principal Harper truly says: “‘There are thousands of men and women 
unable to avail themselves of oral assistance who, nevertheless, are 
eager to study. It is surely an advantage of the correspondence sys- 
tem that it can aid this large class who otherwise would have no help 
and would make no progress.” 
CERTIFICATES AND DEGREES. 
Upon the completion of the four-years course of reading in the 
Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle a certificate to that effect is 
awarded. This certificate is not a college diploma and “has not the 
   
-P-A-G-E-1089
CHAUTAUQUA. 1031 
remotest connection with a degree.” (Official report to the regents of 
the University of the State of New York, 1891.) The Chavtauqua 
idea is to encourage people to pursue continuous courses of reading. 
In recognition of work of special merit, as indicated by the individual 
reports or memoranda returned by pupils to the central office, special 
seals are attached to the above certificate. To graduates of the C. L. 
S.C. are offered advanced courses of private reading, in connection 
with a syllabus prepared by some good authority. Seals are given for 
this work also, and a good Chautauquan may carry on privately special 
studies for many years; but these so-called “seal courses” do not lead 
to any final degree. They are simply advanced reading courses which 
satisfy a growing demand for opportunities of specialization in history, 
literature, or natural science after the student has enjoyed a four-years 
general outlook through the C. L. 8. C. 
By the charter granted in 1882 by the regents of the University of 
the State of New York Chautauqua-has the degree-giving power, but 
she has shown no disposition to abuse the privilege. ‘No honorary 
degree has been or can be conferred under the rules of the board of 
trustees.” But they may confer ordinary college degrees through the 
College of Liberal Arts, although this is rarely done and never except 
in cases absolutely worthy of recognition, Department work, begun 
at Chautauqua in the summer season, is sometimes continued through- 
out the year under the direction of college professors, who employ 
circular letters of instruction, with frequent written examinations upon 
assigned reading. This is usually guided by a syllabus of topics, with 
the aid of standard text-books and works of reference, chiefly helpfal 
in historical and literary courses. Laboratory courses are more difficult 
to secure. 
All candidates for degrees are now examined by the regents of 
the University of the State of New York. Sixteen full courses are 
required after admission to the college for any baccalaureate degree. 
The following ten courses are prescribed: Latin, Greek, German 
or French, mathematics, English, history, mental science, political 
economy, one course in physical science, one course in biology. 
Six electives, subject to approval, may be chosen in regular depart- 
ments. Not more than two courses from one department may be 
counted toward a degree. A single course is regarded as equivalent 
to ten hours’ study a week. The number of circulars of instruction 
sent out in each course varies with different instructors; but in all 
cases the lessons cover enough ground for thirty-two weeks of serious 
work in one subject. Written examinations of a searching character 
oceur at monthly, fortnightly, or weekly intervals, according to the 
nature of the subject. Such written tests are more thorough and sat- 
isfactory than the usual infrequent oral recitations of lazy students 
in large classes. Chautauquans are generally earnest, faithful, and 
conscientious. They have no desire and no motive to shirk. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1090
  1032 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95, 
Before the completion of any department course a written examina- 
tion is required covering the entire work. <A certificate is then given 
by the college examiner and the registrar to the successful candidate. 
Sixteen such certificates entitle him to the degree of bachelor of arts, 
bachelor of philosophy, or bachelor of science, according to his combi- 
nation of studies. Latin and Greek are both required for B. A.; Latin 
and German or French for B. P.; three modern languages for B. 8., 
besides such literary, historical, and scientific courses as those above 
mentioned. 
Under such conditions as the Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts 
imposes very few degrees will ever be won, but when won they will 
represent more honest work and higher attainments than many a 
college diploma awarded in course or by academic grace. In 1894 
only two college degrees were awarded by Chautauqua: One B.S. to 
Mrs. H. L. McChesney, of Albion, N. Y.; and one B. A. to F. B. Waite, 
of Wyoming, N. Y., who had been three years at Hamilton College, 
and who, for extra work, received the same degree from his alma mater. 
In some summer seasons at the Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts as 
many as one-quarter of the entire number of students enrolled have 
already received college degrees from well-known institutions. Chau- 
tauqua University is already a school for college graduates as well as 
for the people. 
SCHOOLS OF SACRED LITERATURE. 
In connection with the college and in cooperation with the American 
Institute of Sacred Literature (directed from Chicago by Dr. W. R. 
Harper) are the summer schools of sacred literature at Chautauqua. 
Considered as a special department of the college, the schools of sacred 
literature are by far the strongest and best patronized. In the season 
of 1894 some 200 students were enrolled for biblical studies. Adding 
this number to the 405 registered in the other 12 departments of the 
college, we have a total of 607. The registration fee in the English 
Bible schools is only $1. Regular tuition for the class study of Hebrew 
or Greek is $5, the same charge as in each of the college and most of 
the special departments. 
In the schools of Hebrew and the Old Testament and of the New 
Testament Greek a large number of practical linguistic courses are 
given, all more or less upon the inductive method, which, under Princi- 
pal Harper’s leadership, runs through all the schools of language at 
Chautauqua. With Dr. Harper is closely associated in the teaching. 
of Hebrew Prof. D. A. McClenahan, of the United Presbyterian Theo- 
logical Seminary, Allegheny City, Pa., and Dr. W. W. Moore, the weill- 
known biblical scholar of Hampden-Sydney. The teaching of New 
Testament Greek is chiefly done by Prof. Charles Horswell, of North- 
western University, Evanston, Ill. 
The general subjects taught in the schools of sacred literature for 
six weeks are: (1) The Bible in English; (2) the Bible in Hebrew and
-P-A-G-E-1091
CHAUTAUQUA. 1033 
Greek; (3) biblical literature; (4) biblical history; (5) biblical the- 
ology; (6) the Hebrew language; (7) New Testament Greek. The 
specific themes of instruction vary somewhat from year to year. In 
the English Bible school the work is sometimes centered upon the 
Pauline Epistles. During the summer session of 1894 the entire work 
was concentrated upon Jesus, the Messiah. Principal Harper lectured 
upon Messianic Prophecy; President George S. Burroughs (formerly 
of Amherst College, now president of Wabash College) reviewed the 
political, social, and religious aspects of the Times of Christ; Prof. 
Charles Horswell, the Historical Life of Christ; Rev. O. C. S. Wallace, 
of Toronto, the Teachings of Christ. All this class work was carried 
on in the morning hours in the college chapel, and was well calculated 
to train students and teachers for efficient cooperation in Sunday” 
schools, where lately the international lessons have been specializing 
upon the Life of Christ. d 
A very interesting and instructive aspect of the work of the English 
Bible school is the popular presentation in the amphitheater on Sunday 
morning at 9 o’clock of “ Bible studies” and “ Bible lectures,” each com- 
plete in itself, by eminent specialists. In the whole work of Chautau- 
qua nothing impressed me more profoundly than those enlightened 
expositions of Hebrew prophecy and Hebrew thought by Principal 
Harper. Professor Horswell’s lecture on St. Paul was also wonderful 
for its historical insight and spiritual illumination. Prof. R. G. Moul- 
ton’s Interpretive Recital of Job attracted a large, sympathetic audience. 
Anybody who doubts the educational value and social expediency of 
critical and dramatic presentations of religious subjects should go te 
Chautauqua and attend a Sunday morning class in the amphitheater, or, 
on a week day, see and hear Professor Moulton present a noble Greek 
drama like Alcestis. Through Macmillan & Co. he is now issuing the 
Modern Reader’s Bible, a series of handy little volumes presenting the 
sacred scriptures in modern literary form. Matthew Arnold conceived 
the same idea in his school edition of Isaiah, but he did not carry it 
out so practically and so fully as Professor Moulton has done. 
HIGHER CRITICISM AND STATISTICS, 
At the closing exercises of the Chautauqua schools of sacred litera- 
ture, August 15, 1894, Chancellor Vincent said that the so-called higher 
eriticism may seem, by emphasizing the human elements in the Bible 
and in the processes producing the Bible, to weaken its divine author- 
ity, but that in reality it brings the Bible itself and the divine life in 
it nearer to the human heart. 
Chancellor Vincent read the following statistics with relation to the 
schools of sacred literature, which will prove of general interest. The 
total number of students enrolled was 200, and the largest attendance 
181. Many States and countries were represented by the students. 
The following is a brief summary: Connecticut, 6; New York, 42; New

THE TEACHERS’ RETREAT. 
Hvery branch of the educational work at Chautauqua is an historic 
outgrowth of the original (1874) normal training class for Sunday- 
school teachers, which, as we have seen, still survives. It was natural 
and necessary that normal work should be extended from religious to 
secular subjects. The whole art of teaching was better promoted by 
comprehensive than by one-sided training. 
The introduction and development of a pedagogical department at 
Chautauqua were first accomplished in 1879 under the direetion of Dr. 
J. W. Dickinson, superintendent of education in Massachusetts. Then 
it was that the so-ealled “Teachers’ Retreat” was instituted. The 
name was perhaps derived, whether consciously or unconsciously, from 
the well-known religious custom of nuns and sisters who, from time to 
time, enjoy in convents what are called “retreats” for spiritual refresh- 
ment and renewal under helpful guidance. To one familiar with the 
Catholic model the contrast between a religious and a pedagogical 
retreat must ab first seem rather violent; but teachers who regard their 
profession as a high and noble calling will find new inspiration in the 
academic groves of Chautauqua and discover new spiritual meanings 
in their withdrawal from active teaching to learn their art anew. Not 
always in seclusion but sometimes in a busy crowd is there a retreat 
from the world. The normal hall at Chautauqua, filled with 250 atten- 
tive and thoughtful teachers from the United States and Canada, listen- 
ing to talks by men of insight on the psychology of children, is a very 
different place from a church or a chapel, but it may be equally good 
for human souls to be there, and it is perhaps not far from the kingdom 
of heaven. : 
In the summer of 1891 I heard Col. Francis W. Parker, principal of 
the Cook County Normal School at Chicago, lecture to a vast audience 
of school-teachers upon the unity of all education, and the need of the 
harmonious development of body, mind, and soul. After the lecture 
his wife recited Emerson’s poem Each and All: 
All are needed by each one; 
Nothing is fair or good alone. 
I thought the sparrow’s note from heaven, 
Singing at dawn on the alder bough; 
I brought him home, in his nest, at even; 
He sings the song, but it cheers not now, 
For I did not bring home the river and sky; 
He sang to my ear, they sang to my eye. 
Colonel Parker is the man who reformed common-school education in 
Quincy, Mass. The school committee there said of him: “He found
-P-A-G-E-1094
  1036 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
our schools machines; he left them living organisms. He breathed 
life, growth, and happiness into the schoolroom.” It is a great thing 
to discover how children think and learn, how their minds play and 
grow amid pleasing natural environments, how the human garden is 
best perfected by studying nature and returning to her ever anew for 
guidance and health. The children are learning most and fastest in 
natural play; their own fancies are in their way as correct as the 
instincts of savages or the speculations of philosophers. Education is 
all one process. Mankind must go through it as does the child, the 
savage, the sage. 
In the summer of 1894 Mr. Walter L. Hervey, president of the 
Teachers’ College, New York City, became principal of the teachers 
retreat at Chautauqua. He gave daily talks and lessons for four weeks 
upon psychology and pedagogics, supplemented by individual reports 
of observations of children. Such books were used for reference as 
James’s Briefer Course in Psychology, Preyer’s Infant Mind, Tracy’s 
Psychology of Childhood, and G, Stanley Hall’s Contents of Children’s 
Minds. A course of public lectures upon psychological subjects was 
also given by Mr. Hervey, who was thus enabled to represent the 
character of his work before the Chautauqua Assembly. Twelve gen- 
eral lectures, conferences, and talks were given by the heads of depart- 
ments and were open to all students in the teachers’ retreat. The 
principal encouraged the teachers to concentrate their work in single 
departments, where definite work was laid out and a definite aim was 
attainable. 
A corps of ten teachers was associated with the principal for the 
conduct of various departments, like manual training; English; form, 
drawing, and color. Three courses were offered in natural science: 
(1) Physics; (2) botany; (3) geology and mineralogy. In all three 
attention was paid to methods of teaching as well as to subject-matter. 
Lectures were given upon the ways and means of developing the scien- 
tific spirit among young pupils. Chautauqua has long been efficient in 
this direction. The class work, object lessons, and geological excur- 
sions of Prof. Frederick Starr were particularly successful. His popu- 
larity among small boys was unbounded. 
One summer there was a Walking Science Club for children, con- - 
ducted through the groves and fields of Chautauqua by Miss Mary B. 
Dennis, who taught her young and enthusiastic pupils to observe the 
leaves of trees, the life of insects, how to catch and preserve the latter, 
and how to classify plants, flowers, etc. All this was a novel feature 
of summer study at Chautauqua and was keenly appreciated by small 
boys and girls. 
During the season of 1894 Miss Schryver conducted class excursions 
for the study of botany and geology. Teachers were taught how to 
conduct field lessons with children. A good beginning seems to have  
-P-A-G-E-1095
CHAUTAUQUA. 1037 
been made in Chautauqua vacation classes for children and in boys’ 
classes for manual training. 
The statistics of the session show that in 1894 the total number 
enrolled in the seven courses of the retreat was 186. Of these one-half 
were in the department of psychology and primary methods, 43 were 
enrolled in English, 21 in form, drawing, and color, 44 in the three 
courses in science, and, counting children and teachers, 14 in manual 
training. Only 10 were enrolled in two departments. 
One hundred and five of the members of the retreat were teachers 
of special subjects; 113 were teachers in public schools, and there was 
a considerable sprinkling of teachers in normal schools, superintend- 
ents, and principals of private schools. 
There were 51 Methodists, 46 Presbyterians, 20 Baptists, and mem- 
bers of 13 other denominations. 
Pennsylvania sent 49, Ohio and New York each 39, and 27 other 
States and countries were represented, including Canada and South 
Africa. 
At the closing meeting of the teachers’ retreat, August 1, 1894, brief 
addresses were made by the heads of the five departments and the 
season’s work was reviewed. The following points were emphasized: 
(1) The plan of specialization which forbids teachers taking too much 
work; (2) the policy of continuity and development in chosen lines of 
work; (3) the desirability of small classes; (4) personal contact between 
teachers and pupils; (5) laboratory work. 
G. STANLEY HALL AT CHAUTAUQUA. 
In July, 1895, the president of Clark University gave a course of five 
lectures at Chautauqua on child study and biblical teaching. Like his 
brilliant articles in the Forum in the year 1894, these lectures were in 
themselves a sufficient justification of the new institution at Worcester, 
Mass., and of all the money that has been expended upon its dominant 
department of psychology and pedagogics. Only the briefest extracts 
from the meager general digest, as reported in the Chautauqua Assem- 
bly Herald, July 29, 1895, can be quoted here: 
“T,—CHILD STUDY. 
“The systematic observation of children began in America in 1879, 
with the publication of the measurements of the height and weight of 
several thousand Boston school children, by which it appeared that at 
about 14 the average American girl was both larger and heavier than 
the boy, who excelled before and later, but that both were larger than 
children of other nationalities. From this has developed many very 
comprehensive studies, showing that growth in height is chiefly in the 
large bones in the legs, is faster in the spring than in the fall, that the 
period of most rapid growth is that of least disease, that precocious 
children are on an average larger than dull children of the same age,
-P-A-G-E-1096
1038 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
ete. Many more special measurements have been made since, as of 
hand, face, ete. 
“In 1880 was published the first American study of children’s minds, 
based upon my own list of 123 questions applied to 6-year-old children 
on entering Boston schools. This showed an amazing lack of what 
children are supposed by primers to know. ‘Large per cents had never 
seen hen, chicken, robin, sunrise, stars, domestic animals, growing 
cereals, fruit, common trees and shrubs, ete. This new science of igno- 
rance has been developed in many directions since. Children and 
moral conceptions have been especially investigated, their idea of God, 
angels, ete., always associated with physical heavens; their concep- 
tions of punishments, rights, favorite stories, etc., have been specific- 
ally investigated. This line of work has made very great progress 
and children’s anger, fears, superstitions, likes and dislikes, dolls, ete., 
have each been investigated.. Their feelings for others, for nature, etc., 
are also studied. * * * 
“11,— ADOLESCENCE. 
“The more we know of the history of education the more clearly we 
see that in every age and land its history begins with adolescence. 
Savages have then their rites and ceremonies of initiation everywhere. 
The Greek, Russian, Lutheran, Catholic, and Episcopal churches con- 
firm, bringing home their strongest sanctions to aid the new desires, 
feelings, and passions awakened at this age; most conversions occur at 
this period; it is a time of physiological regeneration and the point 
where the soul is vastly deepened by new temptations, desires, feelings, 
ete. The sense of sin and personal uncleanliness is far deeper than at 
any other time, so that conscience is first brought into full function. 
“T1I,—PEDAGOGY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT. 
“We need here (1) the professional Bible story-teller. Since print 
came in this is almost lost, but it has marvelous power in good hands. 
A. good story is a kind of anthem played upon the heart. Thirty-six 
Old Testament stories, I think, if told professionally, without notes or 
antiquarian details, would reveal wondrous power. Personally I should 
not object to a few powerful and venerable stories appealing to rever- 
ence for Deity, from the Apocrypha, Targum, Catholic saint legends, 
Buddhism, and other faiths. 
“2, Love of nature should be taught as a basis of appreciating Old 
Testament ideas. For children the sky is full of angels, God, heaven, 
ete. All Aryan deities are named from heavenly bodies and clouds. 
Our hymns are full of celestial imagery. The undevout astronomer or 
child is mad. Roger Bacon alternated the study of nature and writing 
of prayers. Beda turned from astronomy to write Gloria in Excelsis. 
Do you personally love nature or are you a stranger and an alien from 
her sanctities? The relation of nature to the Old Testament is some-
-P-A-G-E-1097
  CHAUTAUQUA. 1039 
what like that of thelatter to the New Testament. In the Old the New 
lay concealed, in the New the Old stands revealed. * * * 
«5, Finally, I hesitate to add a seeret and personal conviction that 
steadily grows upon me as a psychologist, that ritual, forms, and lit- 
urgy are essential organs of understanding the Old Testament. Mr. 
Neale, in his masterly work on the history of church ceremonials, has 
shown us the best elements of the Greek chorus out of which the Greek 
drama grew. Ancient sacred dances, the best music and costumes were 
combined in the processions and forms by which the early church sang 
and marched to its triumphs at the time when it was spreading fastest 
through Europe. The new psychology of the emotions shows these are 
bound up with attitude, gesture, external forms, and even dress in a 
way we had not expected. At the Musee Guimet, the best school of 
comparative religions in the world, I attended a Confucian ceremony of 
the greatest impressiveness, but of which I understood nothing. The 
new psychology of symbols, and especially that of rhythm, suggests a 
new pedagogy in this element. 
“TV,—PEDAGOGY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT. 
“Nothing can be more superficial than the hints at these great sub- 
jects in an hour. You will see that I place the Old and the New Testa- 
ments on slightly different bases pedagogically, and would lay the chief 
stress on the Old Testament before and the New Testament after ado- 
lescence. Not but the New should be taught very early and the Old 
very late, but the deepest meaning of the New Testament can not be 
felt till the birth of those emotions that come at puberty. The heart, 
out of which are the issues of life, the Pauline charity, the higher Eros, 
is the essence of life. 
“T plead from this new, high, and unbiased standpoint of pedagogy 
for the reseue of this grandest and most divine of all cults called con- 
version, the new birth, change of heart, to the central position which 
it once had and should regain in the church. There is something 
before it and after. It should be a more universal experience, deeper 
and more regenerating, fuller of the divine life, possible to every soul. 
There is no other possible way to do this than for many people, care- 
fully, honestly, and prayerfully, to record their own experiences sug- 
gested by the syllabi offered to all who desire to make returns, that 
these may be no less reverently and carefully compared, studied, 
enlarged, etc. Each individual who will thus answer will, I believe, 
contribute to the cause of the New Testament in the world. 
“We have grown morbid and almost prurient about the supernatural. 
All the arts and literature, ancient and modern, are full of it; but of 
the Bible many are ready to say that if Jonah’s whale really had a 
small throat their faith is weakened. The supernatural is the only pos- 
sible régime and treatment of the heart by which it can be kept—as it 
always should be—larger than the intellect. If the supernatural did 
 
-P-A-G-E-1098
1040 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-95. 
not exist we should have to invent it for the education of the deeper 
elements of the soul. The days of Tyndall and the}jprayer gauge are 
long since passed, and there is @ new spirit of harmony abroad. In 
Homer, Dante, Plato, in every art, on the stage, in the nursery, the 
supernatural exists, not only unchallenged, but is psychologically the 
promise and potency of larger things for the soul. Those who have 
capacities for growth feel miracles and later know nature. The word 
supernatural, if it could be changed to supernormal, or even higher 
natural, would not interfere with the conception of Jesus as the super- 
man, the culmination of the entire organic series. 
“The church now needs nothing more than a Neo-Christian move- 
ment that shall rescue and develop our academic youth, now every- 
where lapsing into indifference. No class of men or women so need 
the higher influences of Christianity. To them the higher criticism is 
a godsend. What Matthew Arnold calls Metabiblia is the same as 
the Neo-Christian movement represented by Paul Desjardins, De Vogue, 
Wagner, and others. 
“(V,—INCREASING THE POWER OF THE BIBLE. 
“Modern education almost begins with Pestalozzi’s tale ‘How Ger- 
trude Teaches Her Children.’ It describes the regeneration of a dismal 
hamlet by a good teacher as the principle by which nations are made 
great. Fichte lit his torch here and made Germany the strongest State 
since ancient Rome by becoming the educational State of the world, 
and France has now imitated her example. Nowhere is research so 
relentless—nothing has been spared from it, but nothing has been 
injured. 
“The lecturer protested against the fears, panics, and ‘phobias’ 
that still beset Christians. Once it was the dread of the Moslem; then 
of the Catholic, of materialism, of myth, of human nature, of agnos- 
ticism, pantheism, and what not. Our faith is feeble; let these all 
have their full fling; they can do no harm, and the oracles of God burn 
brighter. 
“ Self-sacrifice, a self-renunciation, is the moral of all morals, the end 
of the Bible. Let human nature go in all its faculties and it will end 
with God, with prayer, and with unselfish devotion. The new psychol- 
ogy is full of this faith and belief.” 
REGENTS’ EXAMINATIONS. 
Under the provisions of the New York State laws the higher educa- 
tional department of Chautauqua is designated as an organic part of 
the University of the State of New York. The regents of the univer- 
sity have established a system of examinations in all academic sub- 
jects. Such of these examinations as may be called for are given at 
Chautauqua at the close of the college session in August, and official 
pass certificates are issued to those who submit acceptable papers.
-P-A-G-E-1099
CHAUTAUQUA. 1041 
The same plan has been adopted in the correspondence department of 
the college, in which all students are required to pass the regents’ 
examinations. All students who desire examinations at Chautauqua 
file applications (designating subjects) with the principal on or before 
July 15. 
For several seasons examinations have been held at Chautauqua in 
studies preparatory to college. The following letter from Prof. J. G. 
Allen, of the Rochester (N. Y.) high school, shows the results, as 
officially reported, of the regents’ examinations of the University of 
the State of New York, held at Chautauqua, August 16, 1894: 
CHAUTAUQUA, August 16, 1894. 
Dear Sir: As a result of the final examinations given by the board of regents of 
the University of the State of New York, August 15 and 16, at the College of Liberal 
Arts, I have the honor to report that a larger number of students took these exam- 
inations than ever before at this place. There were seventy-three! different exami- 
nations in fifteen different branches, as follows: 
Wednesday, August 15, 1.30 p. m., algebra, 6; plane trigonometry, 3; Latin prose 
composition, 3; first-year German, 9; first-year French, 4. 
Thursday, August 16,9 a. m., advanced algebra, 2; plane geometry, 3; second- 
year German, 8; second-year French, 5; Cesar’s Commentaries, 2; Xenophon’s 
Anabasis, 5. 
Thursday, August 16, 1.30 p. m., third-year German, 8; third-year French, 6; 
Homer’s Iliad, 5; Virgil’s Aneid, 4. 
There is no reason why all the departments of the Chautauqua University may 
not be represented and the students thereof receive the benefit of the regents’ 
examinations in the coming years. Doubtless before another year arrangements 
will be made whereby the students pursuing higher college subjects may have the 
benefit of examinations at the close of their term here. 
All of which is respectfully submitted. 
Jno. G. ALLEN, Regents’ Examiner. 
Bishop Joun H. VINCENT, 
Chancellor of the Chautauqua University. 
SPECIAL CLASSES. 
Among the numerous special classes for members for which a fee is 
paid are the following: Piano, violin, organ, voice, banjo, mandolin, 
guitar, zither, elocution and oratory, Delsarte’s system of symmetrical 
development, drawing and painting, industrial drawing, china dec- 
oration, tapestry painting, water-color designing, wood carving, art 
of letter writing, photography, school of cookery, phonography, ste- 
nography, typewriting, penmanship, bookkeeping, and kindergarten 
classes. 
THE NEW ELOCUTION. 
For many years Chautauqua had an excellent and practical school of 
elocution and oratory, conducted by the well-known Professor Cumnock, 
of the Northwestern University. Hundreds of teachers and clergymen 
were trained by him to use their voices in ways more natural and more 
effective in public. Every season public readings in a pleasing variety 
' In 1893 about 50 persons applied for the regents’ examinations.
-P-A-G-E-1100
1042 ~ EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
were given by the Professor in the amphitheater for the entertainment 
and instruction of the people. 
Reading and speaking in easy, agreeable ways are fine arts, and com- 
paratively few persons acquire them either in public or private life. If 
a college or university man will reflect for a moment upon his own cir- 
cle of acquaintance, he will realize how few men are really good lectur- 
ers, preachers, or debaters; how few students can deliver an original 
oration or read an essay in a manner that attracts and holds attention; 
how few persons in ordinary life can even read aloud a novel or a news- 
paper in a way that will not distress the sick and tire the well. Our 
schools of oratory often teach men to mouth their words, to rant and 
bellow rather than to speak as nature meant human beings to speak. 
In the summer of 1894 a new school of elocution was organized at 
Chautauqua, and it is called a “School of Expression.” Mr. 8. H.Clark, 
of Chicago University, represents both at Chicago and at Chautauqua 
the new elocution, which he regards as the basis of the science of ped- 
agogy. The new teaching starts with psychology rather than with 
mimicry and mouthing. Perception and feeling must precede natural 
expression. Reading, recitation, declamation, oratory, and acting are 
viewed simply as interpretations, hence the first importance is attached 
to literary appreciation. There must be some thought in the mind, some 
life and feeling in the soul, before a man or woman can truly express 
anything. All elocution that depends upon mere externals, whether 
vocal mechanics or pump-handle gestures, is unnatural and artificial. 
True oratory is like aspring—spontaneous. Mr. Clark lays much stress 
in his teaching, as does Dr. R. G. Moulton, upon interpretive recitals. 
Students are incited to penetrate to the inner life, the very heart of 
poems and plays, and to throw genuine thought and feeling into the 
art of expression. This was the secret of the wonderful success of 
Professor Corson, of Cornell University, in rendering Tennyson and 
Browning, whether to popular or select audiences. He felt what he 
read, 
The amphitheater during the Chautauqua season is one of the best 
places in the country for the student to observe different styles of read- 
ing and oratory. Hither come public men (e. g., Hon. Andrew D. 
White, Theodore Roosevelt, Carroll D. Wright), preachers (Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale, Dr. J. M. Buckley, Dr. Frank Gunsaulus, Dr. W.S. Rains- 
ford, Rabbi Gottheil, Ballington Booth), teachers and professors (Henry 
Drummond, R. G. Moulton, Owen Seaman, Von Holst, Boyesen, M, C. 
Tyler, George H. Palmer, Dr. Edward Eggleston), college presidents 
(M. E. Gates, J. W. Bashford, Charles F. Thwing, Alice Freeman Pal- 
mer), and a great host of other representative men and women. 
SCHOOL OF PENMANSHIP AND BUSINESS. 
One of the most helpful of the minor schools at Chautauqua is that 
of Mr. C. R. Wells for teaching penmanship, bookkeeping, and good 
business methods. The present writer has derived so much practical
-P-A-G-E-1101
CHAUTAUQUA, : 1043 
benefit from Mr. Wells’s instruction that it seems almost a duty to nar-_ 
rate the following bit of personal experience. 
One morning at the Athenzeum Hotel Mr. Wells was writing upon 
a large blackboard the lecture announcements for the day. Observing 
with admiration his rapid and legible writing, I said impulsively: “TI 
would give $500 if I could write like that.” 
Mr. Wells laid down his chalk and looked at me in astonishment. 
“Would you?” he asked. ‘Yes; I was offered that sum when I was a 
boy if I would only learn to write a decent hand, but I never could do 
it. Now I would give that sum myself if I could dispense with type- 
writers and write half as well as you do.” 
“ Why don’t you learn, and save your money?” asked the penman. 
“Tt is too late now,” said I. 
“It is never too late tomend a bad handwriting,” he replied. “Good 
writing is nothing but a trick, which anyone can learn.” 
“T don’t believe that,” said I. “Handwriting reveals character. 
Good penmen, like poets, are born, not made.” 
“ Nonsense,” said Mr. Wells. “TI tell you good handwriting is noth- 
ing but a muscular trick, and an easy one at that.” 
“Well,” said I, “itis not muscle that I lack, but proper control of 
my fingers. I have written so much in my awkward way that the 
process has become actually irksome.” 
“Let me see you write the word ‘Chautauqua,’” said Mr. Wells, 
giving me a pencil and a bit of paper. 
I did it in my best style, and the penman said: “I see. You make 
your thumb and forefingers do all the work, and you will certainly have 
‘writer’s cramp’ if you keep on writing in that way. But you can cor- 
rect yourself. Let me show you the trick. Sit down at this table, 
open your hand, and rest the palm flat upon the surface of the table. 
That isright. Now shove out your forearm from the elbow and move 
your palm back and forth without stirring your cuff. Good. Now 
shut your fist and continue the same motion. Right. Now take this 
pencil lightly between your thumb and two forefingers. Make circles 
without letting your thumb and fingers do any independent work 
whatever. Let the whole hand and forearm execute the movement. 
Keep your thumb and fingers still. Ah, that is harder, but that is the 
trick. You will learn it. You can not break up the habit of years in 
a moment, or a day, or a week; but you can do it in time with a few 
simple exercises.” 
I saw the point in an instant and determined to learn the trick. I 
went to Mr, Wells’s class rooms, took a few simple lessons, and prac- 
ticed them diligently for weeks like a schoolboy, until I acquired a free 
and easy swing, that up-and-down motion of my whole right hand and 
forearm, without a tremor of the thumb and forefingers. I have since 
discovered that this is the trick of vertical handwriting which experts 
are now everywhere urging on hygienic grounds. I have found that
-P-A-G-E-1102
  1044 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
this excellent trick is a cure for tendencies to writer’s cramp. Ladies 
often have this affection without knowing it. I have taught several 
persons this natural remedy. 
Probably I shall never become an elegant penman, but I would not 
unlearn for $1,000 the muscular trick which Mr. Wells taught me without 
money and without price. Ihad to go to Chautauqua to learn what I 
ought to have learned when a boy at school. A decent handwriting 
is really elemental in all education; but many college men of my 
acquaintance would do well to take a course in reading and spelling as 
well as in vertical penmanship at Chautauqua before writing an illegible 
thesis, applying for the degree of doctor of philosophy, and attempting 
university-extension lectures for the improvement of the American 
people. 
Bookkeeping is also well taught at-Chautauqua. Here is another 
important subject that is practically ignored in the school and college 
training of many young men and women, who sometimes inherit or 
assume financial responsibilities for which they are in nowise fitted. 
The most rudimentary facts regarding the theory and practice of 
accounts are often unknown to college graduates. I once knew a New 
York lawyer, a graduate of one of our best New England colleges, who 
deliberately set to work years after he had obtained a good law practice 
to master the intricacies of bookkeeping, in order better to grasp the 
details of certain cases that he had in court. And he did it finally to 
the confusion of certain witnesses who professed to be experts. The 
theory of Chautauqua is that it is never too late to learn what one ought 
to know. It was the theory of old Cato, when he began the study of 
Greek at the age of 80. 
AMERICANIZED DELSARTE. 
Herbert Spencer says: ““We have had something too much of the 
gospel of work; it is time to preach the gospel of relaxation.” This 
needed doctrine is taught at Chautauqua by Mrs. Emily M. Bishop, 
assisted by Miss Dorothy Bishop, in the Americanized system of Del- 
sarte culture. This “seeks relaxation, rest, reposefulness, conservation 
of vital energy, nerve and brain reenforcement, health, symmetrical 
bodily development, easy and controlled motion, gracefulness, self-con- 
trol, natural expression.” The fundamental principle of the Delsarte 
system is economy of force. This principle is practically applied to 
ordinary physical actions, such as breathing, talking, standing, walk- 
ing, going up and down stairs, rising, sitting, kneeling, ete. 
In a lecture given by Mrs. Bishop at Chautauqua (see Assembly 
Herald, August 4, 1893) she said. Americanized Delsarte culture is a 
scientifically arranged series of exercises designed to give the over- 
worked nervous man or woman such intelligent exercise of the nerves 
and muscles as will rest the tired body and help the will to regain 
entire control of its servants. Elsewhere she maintains that American-

ized Delsarte culture teaches vital economy. ‘Conservation of nerve 
force is the fundamental principle of this teaching. By the freeing or 
relaxing exercises nerve tension is removed from the muscles when 
they are notin use. Nerve force thus drawn from the extremities and 
exterior muscles is conserved at the nerve centers, giving ‘strength at 
the center, freedom at the surface’—Delsarte’s law.” 
There are in the Delsarte system various rhythmical exercises, which 
exert upon the nervous system a quieting and soothing influence. 
Violent movements and unnecessary expenditure of force are not 
encouraged. Easy, graceful motions are taught. Bad physical habits 
are broken up and easy natural ones established. In her lecture Mrs. 
Bishop called attention to the simple fact that many writers will clutch 
a penholder and exert far more nervous force than is actually necessary 
in writing. This leads to writer’s cramp. The same squandering of 
vital energy is often seen in playing the piano, in working a telegraphic 
instrument, or in other finger movements, which sometimes lead to 
partial paralysis or nervous exhaustion from simple waste of energy. 
The Delsarte system has proved of great service in connection with 
the Chautauqua school of expression, elsewhere described under the 
head of the “New elocution.” For mechanical exercises are substituted 
natural, easy, graceful gestures and bodily movements. Freedom and 
beauty of expression are sought and attained. 
MUSEUM OF ART AND ARCH AIOLOGY. 
In 1882 Chautauqua formally dedicated a museum for the illustration 
of biblical archeology and art history. Subscribing to the Egyptian 
exploration fund, Chautauqua has secured for herself many valuable 
and original specimens of ancient pottery and other arts. She is the 
owner of various facsimiles of biblical manuscripts and of an interest- 
ing collection of plaster casts—for example, the Rosetta Stone, the Black 
Obelisk of Shalmaneser II, the Winged Lion and Winged Bull of 
Nineveh, bas-reliefs of Assyrian and Egyptian gods, the Deluge Tablet, 
the Moabite Stone, the Siloam Stone, and many other ancient monu- 
ments. There is also a large collection of photographs representing 
ancient, medieval, and modern periods of art and architecture. 
Classes in history occasionally meet at the museum for the better 
illustration of class lectures. During the assembly season, in the 
month of August, explanatory and well-attended lectures are given 
almost daily in the museum by Rey. C. M. Westlake. The secretary is 
the Rey. J. E. Kittredge, D. D. Illustrated art lectures on sculpture 
and architecture are given in the amphitheater at Chautauqua by Prof. 
W. H. Goodyear, of the Brooklyn Institute, whose book on the Renais- 
sance and Modern Art is now used by the Chautauqua Literary and 
Scientific Circle. Thus art ideas may quicken the American people. 
The present museum building at Chautauqua is an unpretentious 
wooden structure with galleries and is already crowded with illustra-
-P-A-G-E-1104
  1046 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
tions of history and ethnology, as well as of art and archeology. 
Better classifications and descriptions of material and a larger fireproof 
building are urgently needed for this growing and popular museum at 
Chautauqua. Next to libraries and laboratories, museums are among 
the best agencies for the higher education. of the people. 
From the very first Chautauqua cultivated the museum idea by 
intelligent object lessons, models of architecture, relief maps of Pales- 
tine and Jerusalem, and exhibitions of interesting objects from Egypt 
and far-off lands. There has always been a certain oriental coloring 
about Chautauqua shops and bazars. There used to be an “Oriental 
House,” with a flat roof and lattice work and lounges around the wall. 
There was once a “Tabernacle,” with its Holy of Holies, its altars and 
brazen vessels, its cherubim and seraphim. But these things, with 
Noalh’s ark, oriental lecturers in fez eaps, and Arabian camel drivers, 
haye all passed away. The museum is the place where some bizarre 
objects still linger. A really fine model of the city of Jerusalem, under 
a kiosk near Palestine Park, was destroyed only a few years ago in a 
gale of wind, which toppled over great trees and ruined the image of 
the Holy City; but the ground is now cleared for a beautiful park. 
PALESTINE PARK. 
A striking reminder of the Orient may still be seen at Chautauqua 
in the great relief map of Palestine. The hilly country is accurately 
represented, according to the surveys of the Palestine Exploration 
Society, by mounds of stone and turf extending for 300 feet along the 
shore of Lake Chautauqua, which serves for the Mediterranean Sea. 
The Dead Sea, the Jordan Valley, Lake Tiberias, the waters of Merom, 
Tabor, Hermon, are conspicuous features. All the cities from Dan to 
Beersheba are represented by miniature towns of painted iron. Joppa, 
Tyre and Sidon, Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Bethlehem are easily found 
by the local explorer. Mount Carmel, the pastures of Gilead, and the 
hills of Moab are favorite seats for Chautauquans at evening when they 
seek the lake shore to hear the open-air concerts at the pier. Small 
boys climb the dizzy peaks of Mount Hermon, and thoughtful Sunday- 
school teachers follow the dangerous path from Jerusalem down to 
Jericho. The elevations of this great relief map are rather exaggerated 
by seale in order to bring out clearly the contour of country. It is not 
quite safe to stroll along the footpaths of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee 
on a dark night. The lonely traveler may miss his footing and go roll- 
ing down into the Jordan or into its upper sourees. Frequent lectures 
on Palestinian geography are given in the month of August to waiting 
groups of modern pilgrims through this miniature Holy Land. The 
student will, however, get a much better conception of the physical 
and historieal geography of Palestine from a relief map and wall maps 
which are always accessible in the museum building. Chautauqua has 
always been fond of devices for the study of the geography of the Bible. 
Popular and individual ignorance upon the subject is so profound that 
 
-P-A-G-E-1105
CHAUTAUQUA. 1047 
any legitimate agencies for teaching a knowledge of “the Land” as 
well as of “‘the Book” deserve to be encouraged. 
THE BOYS’ CLUB. 
It is no easy task to employ and amuse the growing number of small 
boys who come to Chautauqua with their parents for the summer season. 
Various experiments have been tried, all more or less successful; but 
at last the management seem to have hit upon just the thing, namely, 
a boys’ club in connection with and under the absolute control of the 
department of physical culture. : 
Near the gymnasium, by the lake shore, a large tent has been erected, 
and there the boys meet for all sorts of juvenile exercises under com- 
petent direction. Good leadership is the one essential principle in the 
training of youth. As in tribes of Indians, so boys, young and old, 
obey their chiefs or natural leaders and follow them through thick and 
thin. Boys’ standards of honor and conduct are always those of the 
ring leaders of their tribe or gang. Hence the importance of utilizing 
authority and the tribal or social instinct among lads for their moral 
and intellectual improvement. A born leader, with high ideals of fair 
play and square dealing among boys, can do almost anything with 
them. For example, an athlete and successful ball player like Capt. 
A. A. Stagg in straightforward talks to clubs of large and small boys 
has accomplished wonders in the line of physical, moral, and even reli- 
gious training. He and other well-known Yale men at Chautauqua are 
doing fine educational work in this direction. 
Dr. Anderson and his assistants in the Chautauqua gymnasium put 
the boys through a daily military drill, which is one of the very best 
agencies for teaching habits of order, precision, and quick obedience to 
authority. Gymnastics and field sports are taught the boys by Yale 
College men. Swimming lessons are given under perfectly safe condi- 
tions. The boys are taught to row boats, splice ropes, tie saflors’ knots, 
and to practice all those useful tricks and accomplishments which 
rejoice the hearts of young spertsmen and savages, Colonel Parker at 
Quincy, Chicago, and Chautauqua early showed teachers the importance 
of utilizing the natural instincts of boys in their education. Itis a 
simple fact that they are savages or barbarians throughout their school 
and often throughout their college years. Nothing will develop lads 
faster and better than good physical training under fine personal lead- 
ership and under strict Spartan discipline. It used to be a great joy at. 
Chautauqua to see and hear Stagg train boys upon the ball field. No 
military leader could have received more absolute and ready obedience. 
Good team work, or good morale, is perhaps the secret of Yale success 
in athletics. It has certainly been introduced at Chautanqua, and it 
usually carries the day whether in baseball or boating. 
Three nights each week during the season of 1894 members of the 
Boys’ Club were taken in small relays by boat down the lake to Pen- 
dergast Creek, where they camped out under the authority of Mr. J.A.
-P-A-G-E-1106
  1048 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Babbitt or some other experienced leader of mature years. Here, 
amid the woods along the shores of creek and lake, the small boys 
have splendidtimes. Ranging the forest and fishing the streams by day, 
building camp fires and tenting at night are occupations which fill 
these young savages with joy. They expressed it, however, in a model 
academic yell one evening after sunset when a little company of friends 
with good supplies rowed up the inlet to call upon the camp: 
Rah, rah, rah! 
Rah, rah, rah! 
Bas leBaCst 
Chau-tau-qua! 
The appearance of the boys’ class at the athletic exhibition August 
10, 1894, excited favorable comment: “The boys’ class—80 strong—filed 
in, and under the leadership of Mr. H. 8. Anderson went through a 
series of educational gymnastics, the beauty and grace of which called 
forth a constant storm of applause. The movements were made with 
excellent precision and reflected great credit upon the thorough work 
of Mr. Anderson and the class.” (Chautauqua Assembly Herald, 
August 11, 1894.) 
THE GIRLS’ CLUB. 
In the summer of 1892 a girls’ club, called “The Outlook,” was 
organized by Miss Mather, a graduate of Smith College in the class of 
1883. She has been for some time intimately associated with the social 
movement of the Y. W. C. T. U. It should be remembered that the 
Chautauqua idea and the W. C. T. U. originated at the same time and 
place, in 1873 at Chautauqua. There is now a strong and practical 
tendency toward the promotion of temperance by educational, social, 
and sanitary measures. Miss Mary Mather, of Wilmington, Del., was 
for some time a leader in organizing health meetings and devising tem- 
perance entertainments. Her success in interesting girls in home life 
and useful social work was phenomenal. She was greatly aided in her 
work by Miss Alice Smythe, of Wilmington, Del. Miss Agnes Lathe, 
of the Woman’s College of Baltimore, became the leader of the girls’ 
club in the summer of 1895, 
The design of The Outlook, as indicated by its name, is to broaden 
the vision of girls into life and to apply this vision practically in their 
own environinent. To this end topics are discussed relating to the 
girls themselves, their homes, and their neighbors. The club is not a 
class or a Sunday school, and has no course of reading; but it is social, 
helpful, educational, inspirational. Such themes as the.following are 
discussed by leaders and members: “Realism and romanticism in 
housekeeping ;” “Business methods;” ‘‘Bread;” “What shall we do 
with our great-grandmothers” (or how to modify or eliminate heredity? ; 
“ What to do in the evening;” “Kindergarten glimpses;” ‘Our intel. 
lectual compass;” “The ideal house;” “The ideal guest;” “The ideal 
hostess.” Invited guests sometimes give short talks to the club. One

summer, when Miss Alene M. Skinner, of Marshalltown, was in charge 
of the club, Miss Jane Adams, of Chicago, described her experience in 
the Hull House settlement. Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer spoke of the 
“Ethics of the schoolroom,” likening the teacher’s arduous position to 
that of a mother in her household. Miss Kate F. Kimball, executive 
secretary of the ©. L. 8. C., talked to the club on “After graduation.” 
She spoke of the graduate in the school and home, urging deference to 
parents and consideration and helpfulness to the other members of the 
family. Her hints on reading were to read biography and to commit to 
memory poetry. A suggestion to magazine readers was to study illus- 
trations and learn something of the artists. The country girl was 
urged to start a public library and to weed out the Sunday-school 
library; the city girl to aid in college settlements, philanthropic asso- 
ciations, working girls’ clubs, free kindergartens, the Chautauqua circle. 
Receptions, readings, music, and other forms of entertainment have 
made The Outlook very enjoyable to its members and their friends. 
The Woman’s Journal, in a letter from Chautauqua, dated August 20, 
- 1894, says: “The club is now in its third summer, and has a varying 
membership of from 50 to 200. The conditions of membership are to 
attend the daily meetings, to pay 10 cents, which goes to defray the 
expense of the weekly Saturday teas, etc., and to wear the club badge, 
which is a modest bow of white and pale-green ribbon. As the club is 
largely social, it is divided into tens, each ten choosing a patron saint, 
and to these tens is often referred business coming before the club. 
The patron saints chosen for this year have been Kate Douglas Wiggin, 
Mrs. Alden (‘Pansy,’ who lives here), Lady Henry Somerset, Elizabeth 
Barrett Browning, ‘H. H’ (Helen Hunt Jackson), Alice Freeman 
Palmer, Jean Ingelow, and others. Each ten has its own special 
device, emblematic, if possible, of the life and work of the woman 
chosen, and each in turn gives a quotation, the Ingelow circle giving 
‘It is well for us to be as happy as we can,’ and the Palmer circle, 
‘There is no greatness but goodness; there is nothing lasting but love, 
for love is the measure of life.’” 
One minister’s wife went away from a club meeting saying grate- 
fully, ‘Now I shall know what to do with a lot of girls in our church.” 
The religious training of boys and girls at Chautauqua is provided 
for in the various Sunday schools. The boys’ and girls’ class meets 
daily during the first fortnight in August for the study of Bible geog- 
raphy and history. 
Chancellor Vincent occasionally talks to the Girls’ Club. At one 
meeting in their clubroom in the Presbyterian House he urged greater 
concentration. ‘‘Take one thing and center your attention and power 
upon it. Do it magnificently. Attempt few things, but do them well. 
Woman’s greatest power as arule is in the home life, in the kitchen, 
nursery, parlor, and church parlors. Any emancipation of women 
which leads them to despise domestic duties is slavery for both men
-P-A-G-E-1108
1050 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
and society. Patience, gentleness, forbearance, tenderness are to 
woman like jewels. Get ready for good homes. Nothing is needed so 
much as wifely, skillful women.” 
The Outlook now enjoys spacious accommodations in the new build- 
ing called the Higgins Memorial Hall, erected for special work and 
classes in social science or applied sociology. Speaking of this new 
building dedicated August 14, 1895, the Assembly Herald of that date 
said editorially: 
“While the building adds another hall for services, lectures, and 
social meetings, itis to find its largest usefulness in the service of young 
girls. It is to be their social home while sojourning in our summer 
city, their school, library, drawing room, and cosy corner where. they 
ean sit apart in girlish quiet and seclusion. Some one once said that 
children were discovered only about fifty years ago. The young girl 
discovered herself hardly five years ago. The woman-child is the 
coming woman, wise above all her sisters, strong, vigorous, not afraid 
of the fine education of oar and wheel, touched with the inspiration of 
the arts—and yet a woman. The clubable girl is with us, her clear, - 
brave eyes looking forward to a new girl life, knowing and using the 
education, refinement, and unselfish humanity a girls’ club can give 
her in all sweetness and maidenly dignity. The Girls’ Club has com- 
pletely overturned the old definition of club life. Higgins Memorial 
Hall is to be the coming Chautauqua girls’ clubhouse. Its solid walls 
will typify to her the permanence and dignity of home and home life, 
its fireside corner the sweet companionship of home. Its Gothic roof 
will suggest that broader spirit that will some day invite her to the life 
of the club, the church, and society,” ‘ 
WOMAN’S WORK AT CHAUTAUQUA. 
From the beginning women have taken a prominent part in the 
educational work of Chautauqua. Coeducation has always prevailed, 
and probably the majority of pupils in most departments of instruction 
are ladies. Male teachers and professors are chiefly employed in the 
college work and in the schools of sacred literature, but women are 
prominent in many specialized branches of teaching, especially those 
relating to children and the domestic or household arts. There is at 
Chautauqua a house called the “Jewett Home” for women teachers 
and those preparing to teach. It is under the management of Dr. W. A. 
Dunean, secretary of the assembly, and will accommodate thirty or 
forty guests, who manage their own housekeeping upon a cooperative 
and inexpensive plan. 
There is one building, the Keilogg Memorial, entirely devoted to 
woman’s work. Upon the first floor is the kindergarten, elsewhere 
described. On the same floor are the parlors of the Woman’s Christian 
Temperance Union. On the floor above is the department of china 
painting. Water-color designing and tapestry painting are also 
encouraged, An excellent school of wood carving still flourishes at
-P-A-G-E-1109
CHAUTAUQUA. 1051 
Chautauqua under feminine management. Constructive and free-hand 
drawing and the designing of ornaments are well taught by ladies. 
For many years a school of cookery has been maintained at Chautanqua 
by Mrs. Emma P. Ewing, who often gives public lectures upon this 
important art. The Delsarte classes conducted by Mrs. Emily M. 
Bishop and her assistants are deservedly popular. The Woman’s Club 
holds frequent morning sessions, under the guidance of Mrs. Emily 
Huntington Miller, for the discussion of household economics, social 
ethics, health, and missionary and temperance work. 
Speaking of woman’s work at Chautauqua, Mrs. Emily Huntington 
Miller says: 
“As the tendency of Chautauqua seems to be more and more to unite 
in special departments associated lines of study and research, we find 
the latest outgrowth of its wisdom to be an attempt to organize what 
may be specifically called ‘woman’s work,’ so as to present without con- 
flict its various interests. Woman’s missionary work, both home and 
foreign; the temperance reform, especially in its fundamental educa- 
tional work; all that pertains to home and home making; questions of 
dress and family economics, the physical care and training of children, 
their intellectual, moral, and religious education; the administration of 
charities and methods of permanent help to the ignorant; familiar lec- 
tures to mothers upon the care of their own bodies; talks upon the 
selection and preparation of food, and systematic lessons in cooking— 
these and kindred topies held last year the attention of the Woman’s 
Club. Such work must tell upon the home life. It gives new insight 
into methods; it awakens thought and stimulates research; it gives to 
women a consciousness of mutual aim and interest; it tends to the har- 
monious development of character. : 
“Tf the Chautauqua movement has been a special boon to one class 
more than another, it has been to the women, and especially the mothers 
of America. The zest and eagerness with which they welcomed and 
entered upon its course of study, and the rapidity with which its cir- 
eles widened and multiplied, must have been a surprise even to the 
prophetic vision of its originator, and is sufficient demonstration of 
need and adaptation. 
““Who can estimate what the sense of comradeship and association 
with others has been to women whose lives are necessarily isolated? 
They had gone on thinking their own thoughts and bearing their own 
burdens, regretfully conscious that they were dropping out of sympathy 
with intellectual life and progress, yet seeing no escape, until suddenly 
a hand reached out to clasp theirs. They were drawn into a magic cir- 
cle that brought them into fellowship with thousands of others, all lis- 
tening to the same truths and pondering the same questions, and they 
found in the companionship help and strength. Many a lip that had 
long been conscious of thirst found satisfaction in the fresh draft 
presented to it; many a soul has been awakened to a new sense of
-P-A-G-E-1110

delight by the rousing of dormant powers and the developing of unsus- 
pected resources in itself. 
“Intelligent young women are employed to a large extent in all the 
office work of Chautauqua and in the business management at the rooms 
of the C. L. 8. C. and of the Chautauqua Assembly Herald. Miss Kate 
F, Kimball has long been the executive secretary of that vast nexus of 
local reading circles and her numerous assistants at Buffalo are clever 
young women, some of them graduates of our best schools and colleges. 
Miss Chamberlin is the executive secretary of the College of Liberal 
Arts and is assisted by college graduates. She is also secretary of the 
American Institute of Sacred Literature. Chautauqua experience in 
the employment of women for expert service in offices has proved of 
great advantage to the rising University of Chicago under the efficient 
direction of President W.R. Harper, who is also principal of the Chau- 
tauqua system.”

THE KINDERGARTEN. 
One morning I visited the Chautauqua kindergarten and was de- 
lighted with the gracious, winning manners of the teachers and the 
quick responsive ways of the little children as they bowed and courte- 
sied, advanced, retreated, and circled around in beautiful rythmie 
motions, all intent upon action and all unconscious of self. Then, for 
the first time in my life, I obtained a glimpse into the new heaven of 
child nature when properly cultivated in a kindergarten. 
“Vifty sweet child faces, twice fifty tiny busy hands and nimble feet 
tripping in ‘pretty, pleasant play.’ If the ghost of Frederick Froebel 
could take the place of his picture on the walls of the kindergarten 
room at Kellogg Hall, it would pray to be reembodied that it might 
express its gratification that the principles he formulated are accomplish- 
ing so much, Under Miss Newton’s care these tender human plants 
grow fair and symmetrical. The teaching looks to a kindly nurturing of 
mind and body and true character building. The “Walk and talk” man 
followed with a keen interest the thread of unity which runs through 
it all. Water is the subject for the season. Every exercise of scissors 
or pencil, each play and amusement, relates to it. In their rambles 
together through the grounds the classes investigate it. The five-year- 
olds visit a locomotive at the station and study steam, The four-year- 
olds learn the uses of ice from refrigerators. They are taught to use 
their senses, to analyze, to investigate. 
“T learned from Miss Frances E. Newton that there are over thirty 
teachers in the kindergarten training class, a larger number than ever 
before. More children, too, desire to enter the kindergarten than accom- 
modations will allow. Referring to the kindergarten work of the coun- 
try, Miss Newton said that it is bound to come into the public-school 
system, although it would not be for the best interest of the kinder-
-P-A-G-E-1112

garten to become so. The pinch of the machinery would injure its 
freedom and the spiritual investiture which is now its glory. Miss 
Newton has taught the work here five years. She will, during the 
coming year, be one of the faculty of the Kindergarten Institute, 
Chicago, which is cooperative with the social settlement of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago.” (“Walks and talks,” see Chautauqua Assembly 
Herald, August 4, 1894.) 
CHAUTAUQUA EXTENSION LECTURES. 
The following general statement is taken from the report on the 
Chautauqua System of Education, prepared for the educational exhibit 
of the World’s Columbian Exposition: 
“The Chautauqua extension lecture plan is a modified form of uni- 
versity extension, adapted to the needs of all communities which do. 
not support a regular university extension course. The details of the 
plan, as carried out during the winter of 1892-93, included a single 
course of six lectures on Greek social life, prepared by Prof. Owen 
Seaman, a graduate of Cambridge, England. Any community desiring 
to give the course was provided with general announcements, course 
tickets to be sold at 50 cents each, a 16-page syllabus for every ticket 
holder, and the six lectures printed in large, clear type: The syllabus 
contained a full outline of each lecture, a list of recommended books, 
and questions to be used as a quiz. Hach community provided its own 
reader and a competent person to conduct the quiz. No financial risk 
was incurred, as the Chautauqua office required only one-half of the 
gross receipts (in no case to exceed $25). More than seventy courses 
were given during the winter of 1892-93. 
“ Additional courses were prepared for 1893-94: 
“ Social sciences, by Prof. A. W. Small, of University of Chicago, 
“The Bible, by President W. R. Harper, of Chicago. 
“Poetry of Browning, by Prof. Owen Seaman, Cambridge. 
“Great periods of medizval history and art, by William H. Good- 
year, Brooklyn Institute.” 
An interesting report of progress from the pen of Miss Kate F. 
Kimball appears in her report of the work of the Chautauqua Literary 
and Scientific Circle for 1893-94 (see Chautauqua Assembly Herald, 
August 23, 1894): 
“The Chautauqua extension lecture plan which was inaugurated so 
successfully in the fall of 1892 has met with equal acceptance during the 
past year. It will be remembered that by this plan courses of lectures 
prepared by university professors were furnished in typewritten form 
to any community wishing to givesuch acourse. Tickets and announce- 
ments were also provided, the latter for general distribution, the former 
to be sold at 50 cents each. Every ticket holder was given a printed 
syllabus covering the entire course, and in the necessary absence of the 
lecturer himself the lectures were read by some member of the commu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-1113

nity. One half of the proceeds was retained and the remaining half 
paid to the Chautauqua office. In 1892-93 70 courses were given, and 
during the past year, in spite of the prevailing financial distress, the 
record has been equally good, the courses reaching in all about 3,000 
people. More than 50 communities used the lectures on “Social science,” 
by Prof. A. W. Small, of the University of Chicago. Six made use of 
those on “Great periods of medieval history and art,” by Professor 
Goodyear, of the Brooklyn Institute. Five took “Greek social life,” 
and two the “Poetry and teaching of Robert Browning,” by Owen 
Seaman, of Cambridge, England. The lectures were given under the 
auspices of a great variety of organizations—Chautauqua circles, 
Epworth leagues and Christian Endeavor societies, Y. M. C. A.’s, 
women’s clubs, and other literary associations. Wherever possible, 
persons of special ability were secured to present the lectures, and in 
other cases the lectures were read by club or circle members. In30com- 
munities the course was followed by a quiz or discussion. In many cases 
the lectures were given in churches, but public halls, clubrooms, and pri- 
vate parlors were also utilized. Twenty-three States were represented, 
including an area from New England to California, Montana to Texas. 
“Tn a small Massachusetts town two college graduates, representing 
Wellesley and Vassar, undertook the course in social science for the 
benefit of the community. The lectures were given as a parlor course, 
with an average attendance of 25, and the following report was received 
from this center: ‘The lectures have been a great success and just what 
the people needed to arouse them. Chautauqua is doing a wonderfully 
good work in enabling people of all sorts and conditions to come in 
touch with the best thought.’ Out in a small Nebraska town 40 tickets 
were sold for a similar course, and the secretary writes: ‘They were a 
rare treat to us who do not often have an opportunity to hear a lecture.’ 
A political economy club in Ohio gave the lectures.as part of their reg- 
ular work. A debating club of young men in Delaware took up the 
study of Professor Ely’s Outlines of Economics in connection with the 
lectures. A Congregational minister in Connecticut who enlisted 40 
people in the study of the course writes: ‘Sunday evening I studied 
with my young people by the aid of a blackboard and map society on 
2 miles of country road, 15 miles from any railroad. Results were very 
apparent and I am sure all present drew lessons which they will not 
soon forget.’ In another Connecticut town the course was very appro- 
priately given for the benefit of home missions, and the report gives the 
following facts: ‘We have sold 51 tickets for the social science lectures 
and have bad a very delightful time, meeting in the parlors of private 
residences. The fourth and sixth lectures were particularly fine. The 
Jast lecture and discussion were a crowning success. There wero 
professional men and manufacturers in attendance, and at 11 o’clock the 
people were sorry to go home.’ A considerable number of the courses 
were given under the auspices of Chautauqua circles. In a Vermont 
town where the lectures were given a year ago a circle was organized 
as a result of the interest thus awakened and a part of the proceeds
-P-A-G-E-1114
1056 EDUCATION REPORT, 1694-95. 
of the course was devoted to a set of books for the use of the society. 
The Chautauqua unions of Jersey City, New York City, and Buffalo 
also made use of the course in social science. In Buffalo each lecture 
was given in a different church, so that the course as a whole touched 
many elements in the community. The average attendance was about 
300, and both workingmen and employers took part in the discussions. 
“The Browning lectures were given under the auspices of two clubs 
in Harrisburg, Pa., and Topeka, Kans. The president of the former 
wrote: ‘Our club has enjoyed the lectures very much indeed. Every 
member is enthusiastic over them. They have been a most admirable 
introduction to Browning and we are all stimulated to do independent 
work in the writings of the poet ourselves.’ In Topeka the lectures 
were given under the auspices of the Friends in Council. About 100 
persons attended the lectures, which met with hearty appreciation both 
from students of Browning and also those who were making their first 
real acquaintance with his works., 
“The success of this important feature of the work of the C. L. 8. C. 
will make it possible to extend the plan indefinitely by the addition of 
courses adapted to the needs of many different classes of people.”

CHAUFAUQUA. 1057 
. THE CHAUTAUQUAN. 
The literary organ of Chautauqua is now a monthly magazine, called 
The Chautauquan, It is of the same size as the Century Magazine, 
and is published at Meadville, Pa., by Theodore L. Flood, the editor 
and proprietor. He deserves all the success he has won in this enter- 
prise, for he alone, in the days of Chautauqua’s weakness, had the 
courage to assume the financial responsibility of publishing the needed 
educational material for the C. L. 8. C. Beginning experimentally, 
Dr. Flood has gradually widened the scope of the magazine and so 
improved its literary character and appearance that it now is the suc- 
cessful rival of some of the leading popular magazines. 
The Chautauquan commands writers of the best talent and reputa- 
tion in the educational fields cultivated by its readers. English as 
well as American authors contribute to its columns. The late Prof. 
Edward A. Freeman wrote for it a long series of historical articles. 
Among the contributors for the current volume, 1895-96, are Prof. 
John W. Burgess, of Columbia College, on the Constitution of the 
United States; Prof. N.S. Shaler, of Harvard University, on geolog- 
ical subjects; Profs. Albert S. Cook, of Yale, and L, A. Sherman, of 
the University of Nebraska, on literary themes; Prof. A. B. Hart, of 
Harvard, and Prof. Henry E. Bourne, of Western Reserve University, 
on historical topies. 
In addition to the required readings for members of the C. L. 8. C., 
The Chautauquan contains each month a variety of general reading of 
an instructive character, special departments called the ‘“Woman’s 
council table,” the “ Editor’s outlook,” ‘Current history and opinion,” 
“Talks about books,” and specific directions and instructions for the 
guidance of the C. L. 8. C. 
THE CHAUTAUQUA ASSEMBLY HERALD, 
After the season has fairly opened at Chautauqua a daily newspaper 
called the Chautauqua Assembly Herald is published on the grounds. 
A preliminary issue contains the entire programme and appointments 
fortheseason. The regular issues contain reports of lectures, addresses, 
conferences, concerts, readings, receptions, entertainments, in short the 
news and history of Chautauqua from day to day. There are short 
editorials on topics of special interest to visitors and residents, with 
personals, “Walks and talks,” and the drift of the day. Twenty vol- 
umes of this Assembly Herald. have now been published, and they are 
one of the best sources of information regarding the history of the 
great summer school on Chautauqua Lake. They are the abstract and 
brief chronicle of the whole work. The files are really of great prac- 
tical value to teachers as well as students, for the columns contain 
digests of all the best things said and done in this great summer ren- 
dezvous of educators and specialists. It is no slight privilege to have 
good reports of such admirable educational talks as those given by

President G. Stanley Hall in the summer of 1895, or of the various 
lectures that season by Principal Fairbairn, John Fiske, Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale, and Prof. R. G. Moulton. 
THE CHAUTAUQUA CENTURY PRESS. 
For some years the text-books and publications designed for the 
C. L. S. C. were issued by Hunt & Eaton, or the Methodist Book Con- 
cern, in New York City. A few years ago the Chautauqua Press was 
organized, with headquarters in New York City. This organization is 
now known as the Chautauqua Century Press, with headquarters at 
Meadville, Pa., but with a New York office at 150 Fifth avenue. From 
this press proceeds the Chautauqua Reading Circle literature, not only 
the regular annual series of required text-books, but a great variety of 
general literature used in connection with the various courses. In 
former years it was not unusual for Chautauqua to adopt certain books 
issued by great publishing houses and to secure from them special edi- 
tions for Chautauqua readers. The amount of good literature which 
has been put into popular circulation in these ways is beyond all present 
estimate. 
BISHOP VINCENT. 
An excellent article, by Miss Ida Tarbell, on Bishop Vincent and 
his work, appeared in McClure’s Magazine for August, 1895. It 
appears that he is descended from a Huguenot family which was driven 
to America by the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He was born in 
Alabama, February 23, 1832, and was early consecrated to the Christian 
ministry, which for him embraced not only the Gospel, but the ministry 
of higher popular education. He owed much to the early influence of 
his mother, and has recorded in a little memorial volume the follow- 
ing wods: ‘‘My mother was an incarnation of consistency, fidelity, self. 
sacrifice, and serenity. I never heard her speak one harsh or foolish 
word.” 
From Alabama the Vincent family removed to Pennsylvania when 
the boy was only 6 years old. He was educated at home and in the 
best schools of his neighborhood. Good reading, close communion with 
nature, and association with people older and wiser than himself early 
matured his mind and judgment. He became a school-teacher at 15 
and a minister at 18. He traveled on circuits, read eagerly, and deter- 
mined to devote his whole life to liberal studies in connection with his 
ministerial labors. Not having enjoyed a college education, he sought 
to secure the equivalent by private study, special teachers in Greek 
and Hebrew and other subjects, and by foreign travel. His whole 
life has been for him an educational process. Books, men, nature have 
been his constant companions. The Chautauqua system of popular 
education is the historic outgrowth of an intensely human experience 
and of a practical knowledge of what the American people need.
-P-A-G-E-1117
  CHAUTAUQUA. 1059 
In an article on Chautauqua, its aims and influence, published in 
the Forum, August, 1895, Prof. Albert S. Cook, of Yale University, thus 
speaks of one of the two founders of this great educational democracy : 
“No account of Chautauqua would be complete without a word con- 
eerning the very pulse of the machine, John H. Vincent. On February 
23, 1895, he was 63 years of age. In early life he became aware that 
he had an intellect and longed for culture; but he also had a con- 
science, and, with the views of life that had been instilled into him, 
gave up his dreams of college and betook himself to the work of the 
ministry. Though successful in this, he never ceased to educate him- 
self by every means in his power, and pursued his own C. L. 8. C. 
course long before he recommended a similar, though much less severe, 
one to others. Finally he arrived at the reconciliation of the two 
things—culture and religion—which he had been wont to think alien, 
if not antagonistic. He came to recognize God in nature and in human 
life as well as in the Bible. The reconciliation thus effected in his own 
soul is expressed in the motto inscribed on the banner of the C. L. S. C.: 
‘We study the word and the works of God.’ He is spiritually 
minded, but possessed of an extraordinary fund of common sense. 
Patient, indefatigable, and decisive as an executive, he is winning and 
magnetic before an audience. He is a man of the people, and his heart. 
goes out to them; he tickles them with his humor, warms them by his 
greeting, draws them by his sympathy, and fires them with his ideals. 
He is not only receptive of advice, but seeks it from every source. He 
aims to be the channel through which humane impulses shall accom- 
plish their beneficent work. He is two men in one. As an organizer 
of victory, he has some of the characteristics of Napoleon. Yet he 
might equally be compared with such founders of medieval brother- 
hoods as Benedict or Francis of Assisi. Comparisons like these must 
not, of course, be pressed. It is merely that certain qualities in 
him suggest their consummate embodiment in such celebrated names. 
More often I think of him in the same breath with Lincoln. ‘God 
must love the plain people, he has made so many of them,’ is a senti- 
ment ascribed to the great President, and it is one that would sound 
equally appropriate in the mouth of the good bishop. Lincoln knew 
how.to bide his time and not prematurely advance the day of great 
things. Lincoln relaxed the severity of duty with the kindly play of 
humor, and his approach to the people was largely through this chan- 
nel. Habitually serene and good natured, he could be stern and reso- 
lute at need. In all these respects I trace a likeness between the two 
men. It was given to both to be in some sense, in different measure, 
itis true, the conduits of destiny, or, as they would have preferred to 
say, of Providence. Both will be remembered for their patriotism, 
their humanity, their catholicity, for both have borne, though under 
different circumstances and in different degrees, the burden of a people 
struggling upward, painfully and with many checks, to a serener vision 
and a larger life.”
-P-A-G-E-1118
  i060 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Some of his views.—At the fourteenth annual commencement at 
Chautauqua, August 21, 1895, after a noble oration to the graduating 
class by Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie, editor of the The Outlook, Chan- 
cellor Vincent made a few impromptu remarks, all the more character- 
istic because unstudied, and expressive of some of the deepest and final 
convictions of the educational leader of Chautauqua: 
“T do not intend to make a protracted address. We hada good, solid, 
brilliant address this morning, to be long remembered for the emphasis 
which it placed on life and on character; for the emphasis which it 
placed on the educating power of simply being, for God is our teacher 
aletherwhile:. *"* 7 * 
“T said to myself, there are two or three things which we must be 
after. We must first of all pursue our course of reading, whatever it 
may be—professional reading by those engaged in professional lines, 
Chautauqua reading by those engaged as members of the C. L. 8. C.; 
but, secondly, in connection with this, we must all begin to read some 
of the literature to which Mr. Mabie referred as the literature of life, by. 
which we may be guided in the study of character, by which we may 
be brought into sympathy with those profound realities of human 
experience which we may all enjoy, and by which we may be uplifted 
and strengthened. We must read works of fiction, because that will 
bring before us, stimulating the imagination, creating ideals, warming 
the heart, making the will firm in purpose, the books which will give 
us deeper insight into life. But, thirdly, with our professional reading, 
with our special reading for the benefit of the imagination and the 
enrichment of the ideal, we must ourselves have experience in life and 
in the things which make for true life. It is one thing to read a book, 
it is one thing to hear a sermon, it is another thing to live out in per- 
sonal experience the truth of the book or the truth of the sermon. 
Therefore, in my home, in my family, in my business with my neighbors 
every day, whether conditions are favorable or unfavorable, I must 
make bold war against myself and sin, and do my level best to be right 
and to help my fellow-men to be right.” 
OPINIONS OF CHAUTAUQUA. 
° [James A. Garficld.] 
It has been the struggle of the world to get more leisure, but it was 
left for Chautauqua to show how to use it. 
[William Cullen Bryant.] 
I perceive this important advantage in the proposed organization, 
namely, that those who engage in it will mutually encourage each 
other. It will give the members a common pursuit, which always 
begets a feeling of brotherhood. They will have a common topic of 
conversation and discussion, and the consequence will be that many 
who, if they stood alone, might grow weary of the studies which are
-P-A-G-E-1119
CHAUTAUQUA. 1061 
recommended to them will be incited to perseverance by the interest 
which they see others taking in them. It may happen in rare instances 
that a person of eminent mental endowments which otherwise might 
have remained uncultivated and unknown will be stimulated in this 
manner to diligence and put forth unexpected powers, and, passing 
rapidly beyond the rest, become greatly distinguished and take a place 
among the luminaries of the age. 
I shall be interested to watch, during the little space of life which 
may yet remain to me, the progress and results of the plan which has 
drawn from me this letter. 
[Rey. Howard Crosby, D. D.] 
Your scheme to induce business men and others to pursue useful 
courses of reading in science and history is worthy of all commenda- 
tion. While we can not expect to make such persons scientists or 
scholars, we may expect them to become appreciative of things scien- 
tifie and scholarly, and to be able to discriminate between the false and. 
the true. 
(Rey. John Henry Barrows, D. D.] 
What John Calvin did for the higher education it will yet be seen 
that John H. Vincent accomplished for popular education, 
[Rey. David Swing.] 
The work improved upon a nearer view and a more careful study. 
With such a man as Bishop Vincent to lead the army, Chautauqua 
awakens, inspires, and transforms thousands of persons. It makes the 
young more thoughtful and makes education continue through life. 
[Rey. Edward Everett Hale, D. D.] 
After the general system of public .school instruction, the Chau- 
tauqua system is the most important organized system of education at 
work in the nation. I see no reason why its range should not be 
extended much further. Indeed, I look to it for the accomplishment of 
John Adams’s hope that every man and every woman in the nation 
might receive a liberal education. 
[Rey. Lyman Abbott, D. D.] 
No man in this country has done more to promote good habits of 
reading and thinking and resultant breadth of intelligence, and espe- 
cially largeness of home culture, than Dr. Jom H. Vincent. The essen- 
tial characteristic of the Chautauqua idea is the possibility of giving 
to those who can not take the collegiate education something of the 
collegiate horizon-largeness of view to those whom thoroughness of 
knowledge is impossible. This ideal has been more or less realized 
through Dr. Vincent in innumerable homes.

  £062 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
[Rev. John Hall, D. D.] 
The place is attractive; the atmosphere is healthy; the arrange- 
ments are sensible; the variety of subjects touched is large, and many 
people, at less cost than they expend on ordinary summer vacation, can 
there enjoy intellectual, moral, and religious means of improvement of 
ahigh order. Bishop Vincent there, as elsewhere, has done much good. 
[Phillips Brooks."] 
Iam much interested in Chautauqua, and value very highly the work 
which it has done and is doing and will do for our people. 
[Prof. H. H. Boyesen, Columbia College, New York City.] 
Iam a strong believer in the Chautauqua movement. It brings the 
light of knowledge and higher interests to thousands, nay hundreds 
of thousands, who have had scant opportunities for culture in child- 
hood and youth. It elevates and dignifies their lives, lifting them out 
ef the dull routine of soul-erippling toil and giving them an appre- 
ciation of spiritual and intellectual value. The intellectual activity 
into. which they are stimulated through the agency of the Chautauqua 
lectures, books, and periodicals is making itself felt as a power for 
good in many communities throughout the land. 
[Rt. Rev. Boyd Vincent.] 
Fifty years ago Thomas Carlyle said: “The true university of these 
days is a collection of books.” It seemed a most paradoxical statement 
right in the face of all existing ideas and facts. Universities had 
always been collections of men, of professors and students. Thirty 
thousand students went to hear Abelard lecture. “Give me President 
Mark Hopkins sitting at one end of a log and myself at the other,” 
said a Williams College student, “and I have all the university I want.” 
But Carlyle was right, after all. “The facility of getting books, the 
facility of distributing the knowledge of books, has changed the whole 
conditions of the business from top to bottom.” His paradox has 
already become a reality, combining both advantages in one, and its 
name is Chautauqua—“the Chautauqua university system of educa- 
tion.” I glory init for my own name’s sake. I rejoice init for the sake 
of every fellow American. (Sermon at Chautauqua, August 6, 1893.) 
[Dr. Edward Eggleston.] 
I think Chautauqua was the beginning, perhaps, of that extraordi- 
nary intellectual movement that has been agitating the people all over 
10ne who heard Phillips Brooks preach at Chautauqua writes: ‘‘Those of us who 
were at Chautauqua in 1888 and heard that wonderful sermon by Phillips Brooks.on 
Christ the Perfector of Humanity will never forget it. I remember very well the 
testimony of a prominent Englishman who sat by my side during the service. Said 
Ito him: ‘What do you think of that sermon?’ Said he: ‘I don’t know what to 
think. I am stunned, overwhelmed. I have heard all of our great preachers, 
Liddon, Spurgeon, Newman Hall, ete., but I never heard anything like that.’”

this country and Europe. I do not know any other country in the 
world where so many grown people are seeking to improve their minds 
as in this country to-day. * * * There are two forms of intellectual 
activity. There is that for which Bishop Hurst stands in the building 
of the great university at Washington. The university stands for the 
acquisition of knowledge. Chautauqua stands as the great diffuser of 
knowledge * * * ina democratic way, to the busy people who can 
not and never could go to the university. That is a magnificent idea, 
and it is magnificently realized in some ways to-day; that diffusion is 
taking place through our country, and that diffusion reacts again upon 
scholarship. (Recognition day, August 23, 1893.) 
[A. M. Fairbairn, principal Mansfield Colleg,, Oxford.] 
Bishop Vincent’s work at Chautauqua seems to me wise, statesman- 
like, and beneficent. It is only the most superficial who fail to see into 
the heart of things that can speak of it with disrespect. It does not 
profess to be a substitute for academic culture or the higher education, 
but it does profess to regulate the reading of thousands and to direct 
into useful and thoroughly helpful channels intellects and interests 
that would be wasted by either dispersion, undue distribution, or neg- 
lect. If out of 60,000 readers controlled more or less by Chautauqua 
10,000 could have selected their own literature, 50,000 at least would 
have simply, by miscellaneous and discursive and often idle reading, 
wasted their time and still more dispersed their intelligence. Bishop 
Vincent, by guiding their reading for a few years, helps to form habits 
of study, guides them in wide selection of books, and enables them, 
instead of merely using fiction to fill a vacant hour, to use literature to 
furnish the mind. Chautauqua is an attempt to carry educative, reli- 
gious literature into the homes and into the hearts of the people. It 
was a magnanimous enterprise to attempt; the success that has come 
to it has been thoroughly well-deserved, and there is no man I more 
gladly salute with honor. The men who from this side have visited 
Chautauqua have come away impressed with the work it does. It does 
not profess to be a university in the English or European sense, and no 
man would measure it by such a standard, but what it seeks to do no 
university here has ever thought of doing. * * * I hail Chautauqua 
as one of the great means of spiritualizing America, of creating within 
it a people devoted to high ends, to holy purposes, to rich aspirations. 
May it multiply and grow, and out of the high ends, the readings, and 
the studies may a new, great, moral, and spiritual people grow up, and 
in those days the name of Bishop Vincent will not be forgotten. 
[William R. Harper, president of University of Chicago.] 
I have been intimately connected with the details of the Chautauqua 
work. I have had the best possible opportunities for discovering its 
weak as well as its strong points. I have come in contact with all the 
different classes of students and readers who have come under the

influence of the Chautauqua instruction, Still further, I have been in 
a position to judge of the spirit of the work, whether looked at from 
the point of view of the management or of those who have been assisted, 
and I have become thoroughly acquainted with the principles under- 
lying the movement. I mention these things in order to show that, 
although an outsider, I speak with a knowledge of the facts which only 
one from the inside could possess. 
The work inaugurated by Bishop Vincent and Mr. Miller has, in my 
opinion, already exerted an influence beyond all possible estimate. 
This influence, while primarily of an intellectual character, has been 
also in the truest sense moral and religious. The movement has exerted 
in a thousand ways an indirect influence which can not possibly be 
indicated, although it can very clearly be felt. That it has been in any 
sense a rival of any kind of intellectual work is absurd. On the other 
hand, it has supplemented intellectual work already being done, has 
led many to undertake a higher grade of intellectual work, and has 
imbued the minds of multitudes with a desire for intellectual disci- 
pline, the thought of which had not before entered their minds. That 
Chautauqua in the future will become more and more a power can not 
for a moment be doubted. (Mail and Express, February 22, 1890.) 
[Dr. J. L. Hurlbut.) 
There are two things that have brought me to Chautauqua. There 
are two great facts of this movement represented by this gathering 
here to-night, and those are the two great facts which bring together 
nine-tenths if not ninety-nine hundredths of the people who come here. 
One is the great fact that Chautauqua helps to bridge over the great 
gulf between the illiterate and literate classes; between the multitudes 
of people who do not read, and therefore do not think, and the compara- 
tively few who are leaders and thinkers. * * * But there is another 
great thing that Chautauqua has done. It has, more than any other 
institution of our time, made popular the study of the word of God, and 
because Chautauqua lifts people out of ignorance into intelligence 
I rejoice in it, and I pray a thousand blessings upon it now and in the 
years to come. (Chautauqua’s twenty-first anniversary, August 7, 
1894.) 
[Dr. R. D. Roberts.] 
I want to call your attention to a very interesting circumstance. The 
university extension movement in England reaches its majority this 
year. We are one year older than you are in America. Here are 
two movements that started in countries thousands of miles apart and 
quite independent of each other. We knew nothing of what you were 
doing and you knew nothing of us, yet fundamentally the two move- 
ments had the same great purpose. They march along the same lines, 
studying to the same end, increasing these means for all. That is a 
curious circumstance. It shows that these two movements are the
-P-A-G-E-1123
CHAUTAUQUA. 1065 
natural outcome of forces that lie deep down in the very roots of 
society. They have grown, they have evolved, they are growing. No 
one can tell how great a future may lie before them. I come here 
hoping to learn something from your way of doing things. You in 
America have taken some hints from us and we are helping one 
another, and we are marching to the same-great end. (Address at 
Chautauqua, August 1, 1893.) 
Part III.—THE CarnoLic SUMMER ScHOOL OF AMERICA. 
One of the most interesting and hopeful developments of higher pop- 
ular education in America may be seen in the Catholic Summer School 
at Plattsburg, N. Y. The adoption of the Chautauqua idea by Catholic 
educators, with the approval and encouragement of the present Pope, 
shows the wonderful adaptability of the Chautauqua system, as well as 
the progressive tendencies of Catholicism in this country. The New 
York Sun, commenting, May 29, 1892, upon the original project of 
“The Catholic Chautauqua” at New London, Conn., said editorially: 
“The camp meeting idea has borne rich and abundant fruit, but the 
most remarkable of all is this Roman Catholic enterprise. By means 
of it the Catholic Church may be brought into sympathetic relations 
with the purely American spirit and with American methods and tra- 
ditions, which will have a powerful influence upon its future in this 
country. The establishment of a Catholic Chautauqua is an event of 
high importance and great significance.” 
INFLUENCE OF CHAUTAUQUA. 
The close connection between this new educational enterprise and 
the historic Chautauqua is clearly indicated by the following extracts 
from an article by Mr. Warren E. Mosher, secretary of the Catholic 
Summer School of America, who, with other writers, contributed to The 
Rosary in 1894 good accounts of the beginnings of the whole movement: 
“A retrospective view of the Catholic Summer School of America 
takes me back to an evening in the fall of 1885, when, for the first time 
in my life, the Chautauqua system of education was brought to my 
attention. The information was imparted to me by a friend who had 
just joined a Chautauqua reading circle, and who urged me to become 
a member also. This I was very willing to do upon learning of the 
many advantages of the system. 
“At the first meeting of this circle which I attended I was favorably 
impressed with the methods of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific 
Circle, this being the title of the department of reading circles under 
the Chautauqua system, and from that time the desire took possession 
of me to institute such a system of popular education for our Catholic 
people. 
“For four years I was a member of this local Chautauqua circle, in 
the management of which I took an active part, serving as presiding 
ED 99. 34*

officer two years. The study of the system occupied much of my 
attention, and I became familiar with its various departments, includ- 
ing the reading circle, summer school, college of liberal arts, and other 
departments. As the knowledge of this vast and admirably planned 
institution grew upon me, the difficulties of establishing a similar one 
on Catholic lines seemed overwhelming. The opportunity to make the 
attempt to organize did not present itself until the spring of 1889, when, 
after consultation with my pastor, the Rev. E. Mears, an organization 
was effected on April 6, and the institution named The Catholic Educa- 
tional Union. Father Mears was its first president. He was succeeded 
by the Rey. Morgan M. Sheedy, of Pittsburg, Pa., the present incumbent. 
About two weeks previous to the establishment of the Educational 
Union a Catholic reading circle was formed, for the purpose of giving 
an object lesson of the-system. ‘This circle was called The Home 
Reading Circle, and still exists. 
“Tntelligence cf the aim and methods of this union was spread 
throughout the land through the Catholic and secular press, by corre- 
spondence and personal visits to many places by myself. The project 
met with much favor and encouragement, but obstacles barred its 
progress also at every turn. There was not a dollar behind the insti- 
tution, yet I had determined to devote my whole time to the enterprise 
and make it a life work. 
“In October, 1889, a number of circles which had been organized — 
under the auspices of the Educational Union entered upon the course 
of reading prescribed. [rom the time of the establishment of the union 
until January, 1891, the connection between the various circles and 
the union was kept up by means of leaflets issued monthly, containing 
the order of reading, directions, etc. In January, 1891, the first num- 
ber of the Catholic Reading Circle Review, official organ of the union, 
made its appearance.” 
A CATHOLIC CHAUTAUQUAN. 
The above Review mentioned by Mr. Mosher reminds one of the 
magazine called The Chautauquan. It is edited by Mosher himself who 
deserves great credit for his successful enterprise. The Review is pub- 
lished monthly at Youngstown, Ohio, and is the recognized organ of 
the Catholic Summer School as well as of the Catholic Educational 
Union. Asin the Chautauquan, general and required readings are pub- 
lished in this Catholic Review. It contains valuable articles relating 
to history, science, religion, literature, art, and philosophy. Some of 
the leading Catholic scholars in America contribute to its columns. 
Its influence must be for good upon the development of general intelli- 
gence and a broader culture among its American readers. There is 
a reading-circle department in the magazine for the guidance and 
encouragement of local literary societies. There is also a Catholic 
teachers’ council for the discussion of educational questions of a prac- 
tical character and for the dissemination of correct ideas of pedagogy.
-P-A-G-E-1125
CHAUTAUQUA. 1067 
It was through the Catholic Reading Circle Review, founded by Mr. 
Mosher in 1891 and still edited and published by him, that the idea of 
a Catholic summer school was most strongly promoted. ‘Two features 
of Chautauqua had already been reproduced: (1) Reading circles, pur- 
suing a definite and prescribed course under central direction; (2) a 
monthly magazine devoted to the educational interests of the Catholic 
Educational Union, which corresponds to the Chautauqua Literary and 
Scientific Circle. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT. 
The idea was for some time under discussion, but, according to Mr. 
Mosher, it was not until January, 1892, that the project was given 
public mention. This was in the shape of a letter to the Catholic 
Review, of New York City, by the Rey. James I. Loughlin, D. D., of 
Philadelphia: 
“A few weeks ago Mr. W. E. Mosher, the secretary of the Catholic 
Chautauquamovementand editor of the Catholic Reading Circle Review, 
consulted with me as to the feasibility of choosing some desirable place 
_ where the Catholic educators of the country and those who are inter- 
ested in reading circles might assemble during the summer vacation and 
devote some time to the discussion of educational matters, listen to 
addresses from prominent and experienced teachers, etc. With that 
characteristic of American Catholicity which immediately ‘sits on’ every- 
thing which looks like a novelty, I answered bluntly that ‘the project 
was visionary.’ ‘The time may come,’ said I, ‘when such schemes may 
work, but not in the present posture of affairs.’ I venture to say that 
ninety-nine out of every hundred Catholics in the country would have 
treated the proposition precisely as I did, for there are few of us who 
feel able or willing to ‘run a hotel” And yet, when we take a second 
thought, what is there wild or impracticable about Mr. Mosher’s project? 
There has been an immense and widespread awakening of interest dur- 
ing the past couple of years in the improvement of Catholic pedagogy 
and the cultivation of Catholic literature. How to perfect our schools, 
how to interest our young men and women in mental culture, are the 
questions uppermost in the minds of clergy and laity. Why not hold 
an informal congress for the discussion of such questions? And what 
better plan than a general assembly during vacation time? As the 
Catholic Young Men’s National Union will hold its annual convention 
toward the end of August in the city of Albany, Mr. Mosher suggests * 
that the headquarters of the Catholic Chautauqua might be fixed some- 
where in that neighborhood, either on the Hudson or at Saratoga. 
Every Catholic interested either in the improvement of self or of Cath- 
olic youth might be invited to attend. A special invitation might be 
extended to that valuable and much neglected body, the Catholic teach- 
ers in the public schools.” 
From the time of the publication of the above letter the development
-P-A-G-E-1126
  1068 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of Mr. Mosher’s project was rapid. He says in the article already 
quoted: 
“The matter was at once taken up and discussed in all its bearings. 
Many eminent prelates, priests, and laymen gave expression of their 
opinion in the Reading Circle Review, and a meeting was called under 
the auspices of the Educational Union at the Catholic Club, New 
York City, May 11, 1892. About 25 assembled in response to the call. 
* * * The Catholic Summer School is the outgrowth of the reading 
circle movement, and the reading circle movement, as it now exists, may 
be said to have originated with the Chautauqua system, while the Chau- 
tauqua system, although in a modern guise, bears many traces of the 
system of education in yogue before the Christian era and carried to 
perfection under the influence of the church in the scholastic age. 
“T have mentioned the Educational Union particularly because of 
my connection with that institution, but the Catholic reading-circle 
movement is not due altogether to the influence of the Educational 
Union. The establishment of Catholic reading circles was attempted 
shortly after the Chautauqua circles became known. In 1885 an 
attempt was made to carry on a reading circle in the Young Ladies’ 
Sodality at Youngstown, Ohio, but it did not continue long. Other 
attempts were made in different places and with better success. In 
1888 the establishment of Catholic reading circles was advocated by 
Miss Julia Perkins (recently deceased), of Milwaukee, Wis., through 
the Catholic World, and in June, 1889, the same magazine announced 
the establishment of the Columbian Reading Union, under the direc- 
tion of the Paulist Fathers, having for its object the propagation of 
Catholic reading circles. The first attempt at organized effort, how- 
ever, was made in 1889, with what success the reading public already 
knows.” 
ORGANIZATION. 
The Catholic Summer School was organized in May, 1892, and held 
its first session, as proposed, at New London in July, 1892. The pro- 
gramme for the first season embraced many interesting and valuable 
features. 
The first temporary president of the Catholic Summer School in 1892 
was the Rey. Morgan M. Sheedy, of Altoona, Pa. The first president 
was Rey. James F. Loughlin, D. D., of Philadelphia. 
In February, 1893, the Catholic Summer School received its charter 
from the regents of the State of New York, and in May selected Platts- 
burg, on Lake Champlain, for its permanent site. The land, some 450 
acres, 24 miles from the city, was presented by the Delaware and Hud- 
son Railroad. The grounds, now called “Cliff Haven,” fronting on 
Lake Champlain, have been laid out and improved to a considerable 
extent, although for the second, third, and fourth summer sessions, 
1893-1895, most of the lectures and classes were held for convenience 
in the city of Plattsburg.
-P-A-G-E-1127
CHAUTAUQUA. 1069 
The first building erected at Cliff Haven was for administration pur- 
poses. It stands fronting the lake at the northeast corner of the 
ground and cost about $2,500. It contains an auditorium accommodat- 
ing about 300 people. The managers intend to build a chapel on a 
beautiful forest knoll overlooking the water, and’ to christen the chapel 
“Our Lady of the Lake.” A larger auditorium is in prospect. Cot- 
tages are now planned, with boarding houses and restaurants. Soon 
we may expect to see reproduced at Cliff Haven, on the border of Lake 
Champlain, an academic village worthy of its historic prototype on 
Lake Chautauqua. 
In August, 1893, the Rey. Thomas J. Conaty, D. D., of Worcester, 
Mass., was elected president, and he has since continued in that elective 
office. Clergy and laity appear to be about equally represented on the 
present board of trustees. The summer school at Plattsburg is under 
the direction of the Catholic Church. Bishop Gabriels, of Ogdéns- 
burg, in whose diocese the school is planted, is its ordinary or episcopal 
superior. Archbishop Corrigan is the metropolitan, for Plattsburg is 
in his ecclesiastical province. 
SESSION OF 1895. 
The following account of the third session of the Catholic Summer 
School was written by the Rev. Morgan M. Sheedy, of Pittsburg: 
“The third session of the Catholic Summer School of America opened 
July 14 and closed August 13, 1894. It was in every respect the most 
notable and successful assemblage of the students and friends of higher 
education on strictly Catholic lines who, during the past three years, 
have been following the summer school course of lectures. 
“In the increased attendance over preceding years, in the widely 
~ separated sections of the country represented, in the range and variety 
of the subjects discussed, all of which were of present and practical 
interest, in the growing favor with which the summer school idea has 
been received by the clergy and hierarchy of the church, which was 
manifested by the presence of priests and bishops deeply interested in 
the daily work of the school, in the many pleasant reunions of former 
students of college and academy and the happy hours of sweet inter- 
course of highly cultivated men and women, in the beautiful spirit of 
social harmony that prevailed everywhere, there was nothing wanting 
to make the session that just closed at Plattsburg, on the eve of the 
feast of our Lady’s Assumption, the most successful in the short history 
of the Catholic Summer School. 
“Tn the brief space allotted to the writer it is only possible to note a 
few things that contributed to this success. The increased attendance * 
was largely due to the conferences of reading circles held last winter 
and spring in Boston, Philadelphia, Rochester, New York, and Chicago. 
In these conferences the work done at the summer school and the 
meais of doing it were fully and clearly set forth. The aims and objects
-P-A-G-E-1128

of the school were made known to Catholic students interested in the 
problems that are at present stirring men’s souls; and many were 
desirous of knowing how those problems were to be met and answered. 
by- Catholic teachers, men of rare and acknowledged ability, each in 
his own department of science, art, history, law, philosophy, and reli- 
gion. Accordingly they came in large numbers and set themselves 
down by the placid waters of Champlain to drink in, during the four 
weeks of the session of the school, truth and wisdom. 
“ As was to be expected, the majority of the students came from New 
England and Middle Atlantic States, though there were representa- 
tives from States as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky 
and Louisiana. Brooklyn, among the cities of the country, had the 
honor of having the largest delegation, while New York, Rochester, 
Buftalo, and Boston sent a large number of students. The personal 
efforts made by individuals was also felt in this year’s attendance. 
Those who come one year return home determined to make known-to 
their friends the many advantages to be gained by attendance at the 
school. 
“Of the lectures there is space only for a short summary. By refer- 
ence to the syllabus we find a wide range and much variety. Hthics, 
law, science, American institutions, Catholic literature, early educators 
and missionaries, studies among famous English authors, work in Sun- 
day schools, social problems, young men in public life, astronomy, Chris- 
tian art, Catholic organization of intellectual forces, artists and their 
masterpieces—these were the subjects discussed during the first three 
weeks of the school. The fourth week, which was chiefly intended for 
teachers in our schools, had a special normal course, a series of lectures 
on logic and pyschology, language and literature, mathematics, history, 
and a series on the Bible and the encyclical of Pope Leo XIII on the 
study of the Scriptures. This list will give the reader some idea of the 
value and importance of the work done at the school. It is no child’s 
play, nor is it a hard task voluntarily imposed by those in attendance, 
for the subjects that may be considered difficult and abstruse are, by 
the skillful treatment of the lecturers, so handled as to be easily com- 
prehended by the ordinary mind. 
“Not the least important, and certainly one of the most pleasing 
features of the school, was its social side. There were many receptions 
to distinguished friends and visitors, such as those tendered to his 
grace the Most Reverend Archbishop of New York, to the bishop of 
the diocese, to Bishop Watterson, and the newly consecrated Bishop 
of Albany, N.Y. There were readings, musicales, and a special recep- 
tion to the Catholic authors and writers present at Champlain. Various 
excursions to points of interest in this historic and romantic region—to 
Au Sable Chasm, to Saranac, to Montreal, Burlington, and to the 
shrine of Ste. Anne de Beaupré, which were undertaken by the whole 
school or by small parties—filled in profitably and pleasantly, indeed, 
the hours needed for recreation and rest. * * *

“What rendered this session most notable was the laying of the 
corner stone of the new administration building on the ground of the 
school by Archbishop Corrigan, of New York, on the afternoon of Sun-_ 
day, July 29, and the communication to the school, by the apostolic 
delegate, of the letter of the Holy Father approving the movement. 
We subjoin both the letter of Archbishop Satolli and that of the Pope: 
[Letter from Archbishop Satolli.] 
WASHINGTON, D. C., July 14, 1894. 
REVEREND Dear Sir: With no little surprise I find that the letter of His Holiness 
Leo XIII commending with highest praise the Catholic Summer School of America 
has come to me. Most undoubtedly the institution over which you preside is one in 
every way worthy of commendation and encouragement. If before the session closes 
it be possible to visit you, I shall give you notice. Meanwhile be assured that I am 
ready and willing to render your Champlain school any service in my power. 
Wishing you a full measure of success, I am, devotedly, yours, in Christ, 
FRANCIS, ARCHBISHOP SATOLLI, 
Apostolic Delegate. 
Rev. THomas J. Conary, D. D. 
[Tho Pope’s letter.] 
To our Venerable Brother Francis, Archbishop of Lepanto, Apostolic Delegate in the 
United States of North America, Washington, D. C. 
Venerable Brother, health and apostolic benediction: It has recently been brought 
to our knowledge that, among the many movements so opportunely set on foot in 
the United States for the increase of religion, a Catholic summer school, through the 
cooperation of clergy and laity, has been established on Lake Champlain, at Platts- 
burg, in the diocese of Ogdensburg. We have also learned that the school has been 
affiliated by the board of regents of the University of New York, and empowered to 
confer degrees upon those who follow its courses of study. There were many reasons 
for the founding of a school of this kind; one affecting the good of religion, that 
Catholics by their union of thought and pursuits may the more effectively defend 
the Catholic Church, and induce our brethren who are separated from us concerning 
the Christian faith to make their peace with her; another, that by means of lectures 
from learned teachers the pursuit of the highest studies may be encouraged and pro- 
moted; finally, that through the principles laid down by us in our encyclical on the 
condition of labor, and by their practical illustration and application, the peace and 
prosperity of your fellow-citizens may be secured. We are aware that bishops have 
been the promoters of these things because they saw that in many ways notable 
benefits would result therefrom. Moved, nevertheless, by our great desire that the 
best interests of the people of the United States may be furthered by the constant 
addition of new helps, we are pleased to give our commendation to the trustees of 
this summer school, and to exhort them not to depart from the road which they have 
already taken, but to go forward in it with braver confidence. Since we have been 
informed, also, that in a short time the third annual session of the school will be 
held, and that bishops, priests, and members of the laity will be present, we send to 
those who will attend our heartiest greeting, praying God to bless their undertaking 
and purposes. We trust, venerable brother, that in this your aid will not be want- 
ing, and that by constant assistance you will encourage these assemblies of Catho- 
lies, and see that the largest benefits accrue therefrom to religion and good citizen- 
ship. May the apostolic benediction, which we impart most lovingly, be an earnest 
of the many heavenly blessings with which we pray the Almighty to reward your 
zeal, and that of the other bishops, priests, and people.

  1072 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
SESSION OF 1895. 
A syHabus of lectures, given at the Catholic Summer School at its 
fourth session, July 6 to August 19, 1895, was published in the shape 
of a small pamphlet of 40 pages by D. C. Heath & Co. It contains 
also the names of the board of trustees, the executive committee, the 
board of studies, the directing board of the Reading Circle Union, and 
the women’s auxiliary committee. 
A noticeable effort has been made at Plattsburg to systematize popu- 
lar instruction. The lectures are all arranged in courses, each with an 
elaborate and printed outline for the convenience of students. No 
single lectures find a place in the schedule. Thrée distinct courses 
were given each week of the summer session in 1894. The mistake of 
surfeiting the public was not made. To illustrate the plan of work the 
following examples will suffice: 
The first week there was a course of five lectures at 9.30 a. m., by 
_ the Rey. W. H. O’Connell, of Boston, upon the “External relations of 
the early church.” At 11 a. m., from Monday till Friday, there were 
lectures on the “Philosophy of literature” by Conde B. Pallen, Ph. D., 
of St. Louis. On four evenings in the week there were popular scien- 
tific lectures by Rey. T. J. A. Freeman, of Woodstock, Md. Saturday 
evening was usually devoted to social receptions or other festivities. 
There was manifest method and continuity in the make-up of the 
programme from week to week. The “Internal development of the early 
church” was presented by James I’. Loughlin, D. D., of Philadelphia, 
in a course of five morning lectures. Then followed the beginnings of 
English literature, French literature, Spanish colonization of America. 
Evening lectures on popular science gave way to lectures on the Bible. 
As at Chautauqua, so at Plattsburg, manifestly great importance is 
attached to religious as well as to scientific studies. ‘The impetus,” 
says Dr. Conaty, “that hasbeen given to the study of the Bible by the 
recent encyclical of Leo XIII called for a special line of work upon the 
sacred Scriptures.” 
Lighter and entertaining subjects were not left out of the programme. 
Col. Richard Malcolm Johnston, that charming story-teller from Balti- 
more, gave a course of five lectures on the “Evolution of the novel.” 
The history and evolution of music were illustrated in a pleasing 
manner. The possibilities of this kind of popular education are just 
dawning upon the American cities and summer schools. The history 
and philosophy of art were represented at Plattsburg in evening 
lectures. 
Special courses were also offered in drawing, elocution, cooking, 
botany, and other popular subjects. In a résumé of the summer’s 
work, published in the Worcester Spy, August 25, 1895, the Rey. Dr. 
Conaty, president of the school, said: ‘“ Miscellaneous subjects, the 
single lecture, the ordinary topic of current interest, all were carefully 
eliminated from the programme. It was felt that the summer-school
-P-A-G-E-1131
CHAUTAUQUA. 1073 
idea was not so much to please the fancy or to follow the facts of every- 
day society, nor to scatter the thought of the students over a variety of 
matters, but rather to concentrate thought upon a definite line of study 
which would give to the summer school something of the character of 
a systematic college instruction, covering a period of years. * * * 
The programme had init a harmony of thought and a unity of purpose. 
The subjects were subjects which commend themselves to the higher 
lines of thought and adapt themselves as well to the ordinarily edu- 
cated mind.” : 
Regarding the social side of the Catholic Summer School, its presi- 
dent remarks: “The receptions given by the ladies on the Saturday 
evenings of the session have been sources of delight and pride to the 
‘school, for they have proved that among our Catholic people there is an 
undeveloped social strength, which gatherings like the summer school 
will tend to develop. Catholics coming together from all sections of 
the country are led to know one another better, to become acquainted 
with the men and women who have earned distinction in lines of study 
and success, men and women of literary prominence, distinguished in 
church and state, and thus the social elements of the Catholic people 
are welded together into a mighty mass, which must tend toward the 
uplifting of our people into that position which they should occupy as 
a part of this great nation.” 
The attendance upon the summer session in 1895 was highly gratify- 
ing to the friends of this Catholic school. About 1,500 different per- 
sons were registered. They came from regions as far west as Salt Lake 
City; from Canada on the north and Florida on the south. Twenty- 
eight States were represented. New York led with 713 students. 
Massachusetts sent 190; Pennsylvania 55. New York City and Bos- 
ton had the largest municipal delegations, although Brooklyn, Phila- 
delphia, Buffalo, Rochester, Springfield, and Worcester were not far 
behind. When the accommodations become more adequate, when cot- 
tages and summer hotels are erected at Cliff Haven, we may expect to 
see an even larger,attendance. The Catholic Summer School meets a 
recognized want for both clergy and laity. It will afford a popular 
retreat from the routine labors and social or business distractions. 
There is something irresistibly attractive to human nature in the 
idea of a summer encampment on lake or stream. Men like to get 
away from towns and cities and to enjoy communion with nature. 
When to the charms of the lake shore are added the comforts of home 
life, the attractions of literature, art, and music, neither the creature 
discomforts of savage life in the woods nor the jejune pleasures of the 
summer hotel, with all its piazzas and social inanities, can successfully 
vie with the summer school, if rightly managed, as a rational mode of . 
recreation and enjoyment. One who has tried the experiment will 
confess the advantages of pleasant intellectual occupation and of 
civilized life in summer vacation over social dissipation and expensive 
savagery.

1074 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
FUTURE OF THE WORK. 
The Rey. Thomas J. Conaty, now president of the Catholic Chautau- 
qua, writes concerning its future: 
“The Catholic Summer School of America is an assured fact. Cath- 
olics have long called for it, and in its existence it corresponds, in some 
measure, to their ideas, and satisfies their desires. They have recog- 
nized its necessity and its usefulness, and now they are appreciatingly 
grateful for the efforts made to establish it. As an intelligent force in 
Catholic educational work it has demonstrated its power. It is not a 
college, much less a university, but it aims by lectures and correspond- 
ence to give opportunity for study along special lines of advanced 
thought; to open up fields for research in science and philosophy; to 
bring together representative teachers of all branches of learning, who 
will give to students the results of life work; to unite in social inter- 
course Catholics from different parts of the country; in a word, to 
mold a Catholic student element into a strength and influence for good 
which will save not merely the individuals composing it, but will reach 
out into society and save it. This will redound to the credit of the 
church and provide able and intelligent defenders of sacred truth 
against the falsehoods of heresy and agnosticism. The purpose of the 
school is to supplement and complement the work of education, so well 
eared for in our schools and academies. It will serve to repair, on the 
one hand, the injury done by defective education, and on the other to 
broaden and more generally embellish what is already good. It reaches 
out to our busy men and women and offers them the privilege of special 
study which will supply for them much which they long for but can 
not obtain without great danger to the principles of truth and right 
action. In this the prospective of our summer school is that of a quasi 
university of special knowledge—a people’s university—to enter which 
the only requisite is heart and mind seeking greater light and fuller 
development of .truth. The colleges and universities which train the 
minds and hearts to the enjoyment of higher education open their doors 
to the very few who alone have time, means, and ambition to pursue their 
courses of study. Shall the many be left to content themselves with 
the pittance which comes from fewer years at school? Has higher 
education nothing for them? The summer school answers that ambi- 
tion. Desire for self-improvement among the people, even among those 
who have already received more than the average, must be and is 
answered in the summer universities, where all tastes are sought to be 
satisfied. The movement is in its infancy among us Catholics, but 
Chautauqua has demonstrated its usefulness and its success. Its pos- 
sibilities are as vast’as the wants of our people. It may become an 
attachment of school, academy, college, and even university. It may 
serve as a valuable assistant to lyceum and association, to literary,
-P-A-G-E-1133
CHAUTAUQUA. 1075 
scientific, and philosophical research in reading circle or at the fireside’ 
of one’s home. It brings at once into our private and public Catholic 
life the results of the intellectual endeavors of our best scholars, our 
most profound thinkers, who, under the inspiration of our holy faith, 
have sounded the depths of secular knowledge, and who come to 
us with arms full of sheaves of ripe scholarship with which to orna- 
ment the education of our schools and homes. The prospective of the 
Catholic Summer School is a parent home by the banks of the beauti- 
ful Champlain and branch schools throughout the country, permeating 
our social life and bringing near to our people, in all sections of our 
great country, the many advantages which have now to be sought for 
at much sacrifice. 
“Champlain, the first attempt of Catholics, is the pioneer school—first 
inissionary, as it were, in the endeavor for higher education for the 
people. We are but sowers of the idea, reaping, indeed, some of the 
results; but those who come after will reap them in the fullness of a 
ripened harvest. A college city, a university town, will rise up upon 
the banks of the lake; halls of science will welcome to their lecture 
rooms the thousands of students who, like pilgrims of old, will journey 
thither seeking knowledge. Hospitality will spread its pleasant cheer 
before all, and enjoyment and mirth will make the hours of relaxation 
pass amid the joys of innocent friendship. Days will come and go, 
and learned travelers will delight the student world with the tales of 
discovery and research; philosophers and seers, with the illumination 
of faith upon their words, will separate the dross from the gold in the 
principles of life; and a purer and higher knowledge of God and of 
themselves will come to the earnest seekers. The warriors of faith, 
while discoursing of the deeds of old, will help prepare the weapons of 
defense for all to use in the battles of the present; builders of a true 
life will train mind and heart in the skill necessary for the building of 
the structure of faith. In a word, the Catholic Summer School of 
America has a future which may be made a potent factor of our reli- 
gious and social life as American Catholics, opening to them their place 
in the great intellectual movement which is destined to bring to our 
church and our people the treasures of mind and heart which truth 
transmits across the ages as our inheritance. Our duty is to drink 
deep at its springs, equip ourselves well for our responsibilities as 
American Catholics, and, by the true education of intellect, add luster 
to our church, happiness to our homes, and salvation to our great and 
glorious country. 
“Tts location, somewhat remote from the haunts of great travel, is 
an advantage in the exclusiveness of student life which it guarantees. 
None but those who are in sympathy with the work will seek its quiet 
shades. It will have no attractions for those governed by curiosity or 
pleasure alone, and the earnest student will not have his life marred 
by the interruptions which come from hordes of pleasure seekers.

* Education itself makes the community exclusive, and that which is 
purchased with sacrifice is most appreciated. Our Catholic Summer 
School in its future is the home of Americans seeking all that truth 
can give.” 
CATHOLIC READING CIRCLES. 
The following suggestions for organizing and conducting reading 
circles have been published in the Catholic Reading Circle Review. 
They are very practicable, and may be applied in any neighborhood 
where there is social intelligence: 
“A reading circle is several or more persons who meet together for 
mutual intellectual help and improvement. A circle may be confined 
to the family circle; it may be formed among members of a sodality or 
other organizations, or it may be made up of persons of many organ- 
izations. It may be exclusively of young men or young women, or 
both, and it may include old and young. They may be formed in 
academies and colleges for supplementary reading, and by alumni 
societies. é 
“A circle may be formed by calling a public meeting through the 
press or by an announcement in the parish church, or it may be formed 
by a few persons quietly, and the membership limited. No person, 
however, should be excluded. Generally better results are obtained 
in circles of not more than thirty members than in larger circles, but 
there are successful circles of the C. E. U. [Catholic Educational Union] 
with more than fifty members. 
“The organization should be simple, and so conducted that all may 
feel at home and take part in it. 
“The officers usually are a president, vice-president, secretary, treas- 
urer, and a programme committee. As much of the success of a circle 
depends npon its officers, care should be taken in their selection. 
“Adopt a constitution containing only the simplest rules necessary 
for system and order, and select a name and -motto significant and 
appropriate. 
“Small circles sometimes meet at the homes of the members in turn. 
A permanent meeting place is generally found in a pleasant room of 
some association. 
“Meetings should be held weekly, if possible. 
“The manner of conducting a circle has much to do with its success. 
There are as many ways of interesting and instructing a circle as there 
are successful methods of conducting classes in schools and colleges. 
“The requirements of circles are as varied as their membership, and 
leaders must select and follow methods suitable to their special needs. 
“The following plan has been tried with success: | 
“A leader is appointed for each study, and the responsibility of con- 
ducting exercises on the study placed upon him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1135
CHAUTAUQUA. 1077 
“The circle is divided into sides, and a competition entered into for 
the following credits: 
“(1) Attendance at meetings. 
“(2) Promptness in being present at the appointed time. 
“(3) Responding to the roll call with a quotation. 
“(4) Performance of duties assigned. 
“(5) Keeping up to date with the required reading prescribed by the 
Cc. E. U. : 
“(6) When discussing current events to relate some matter of cur- 
rent news not previously mentioned at the meeting. 
“(7) Answering the question drawn at the previous meeting from 
the question box. 
“The president, whe is not on either side, keeps a record of the 
merits, and at the end of the year’s reading the winning side is ban- 
queted by the losers.”

CHAPTER XX. 
PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 
_It has not been the custom in this country to pension civil officials, 
but of late years a movement has been on foot among teachers to pro- 
mote the payment of annuities or pensions to teachers disabled by 
illness or old age. In a few cities this movement has resulted in laws 
passed by the legislatures of the respective States which authorized 
the city authorities to raise a pension fund, the proceeds of which are 
to be used in paying pensions to teachers after a certain number of 
years of service. The intention is evidently to secure a longer tenure 
of office to teachers, to weed out disabled persons, and secure better 
talent by holding out the inducement of provision for old age or sick- 
ness. 
The following is an extract from the fifteenth annual report of the 
superintendent of Boston public schools. It states the conditions pre- 
vailing in Massachusetts, or rather in Boston: 
The Boston Teachers’ Benefit Association.—Among the unsolved practicai questions 
connected with the public school service in large cities is that of making suitable 
provision for superannuated teachers. Men and women who have spent the prime 
and strength of their lives in the public school service have claims to consideration 
which only the most barbarous could deny; and yet, as things are now managed, it 
is often impossible to regard these claims without sacrificing the best interests of 
the children in the schools. ‘The problem is to devise some practical method whereby 
teachers who have passed their prime shall receive all merited consideration for long 
and faithful service, without at the same time impairing the efficiency of instruction 
in the schools. No one acquainted with our schools will affirm that there is any such 
method in use now. There are no pensions for those who retire; nor is there any 
way of giving reduced work and reduced pay, for a while, to teachers whose useful- 
ness, though impaired, is not gone. 
Several years ago the school committee took up this matter seriously, and devised 
a system of pensions for retiring teachers, but nothing came of it, except that the 
eyes of many people were opened to the need of some such system. The argument 
for a pension system does not rest alone or chiefly on the claims that long-tried and 
faithful servants have to considerate and merciful treatment, strong as these claims 
may be; it rests chiefly on the interest which the public has in securing the highest 
character and efficiency in the public school service. Probably the school commit- 
tee could do nothing which would more enhance the dignity, the attractiveness, and 
the efficiency of the public school service in this city than to put in operation a good 
system for the gradual retirement and pensioning of teachers. Why should not the 
management of the public school service be as wise as that of the best colleges and 
the most successful private corporations? The professor emeritus is paid a salary 
(a reduced salary, perhaps) more in consideration of his past than of his present 
1079 
 
-P-A-G-E-1138
1080 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
service. Would it not be a wise policy to encourage teachers with the prospect of 
a like dignified and honorable retirement after long and faithful’service? Would 
not the schools be enough better managed and taught to make it in the long run an 
economical policy? 
In the school system of a great city it should be impossible to distribute duties in 
such a way that less exacting cares may fall to the share of those who, though already 
worn, are not yet wholly incapacitated for useful service; and if well-managed private 
corporations find it for their pecuniary advantage to take good care of aged and 
enfeebled employees, why will not the city gain by a similar policy—not money, 
indeed, but increased efficiency in the public school service? The difficulties in the 
way of beneficial action in this matter do not seem insurmountable—would probably 
sink into insignificance in presence of a hearty determination to overcome them. It 
may not be unreasonable to hope, therefore, that this vitally important matter may 
be taken seriously in hand by the leaders in city and State affairs. Boston and Mas- 
sachusetts should lead the way in placing the public school service on a better basis 
than it has ever yet stood upon in this country. 
So much I have thought it fitting to say by way of preface in a notice of the 
Boston Teachers’ Mutual Benefit Association, an organization that has no official 
connection with the school committee, yet one which is doing a work that has a direct 
bearing on the welfare of the schools. I do not think that this voluntary organiza- 
tion of the teachers answers the needs I have pointed out; but it mitigates the ills 
that arise from the present irregular and haphazard mode of treating superannuated. 
teachers. For the information which follows I am indebted to a member of the 
association. 
The Boston Teachers’ Mutual Benefit Association is based upon a similar organ- 
ization in New York, the plan of which was brought before some of the teachers of 
this city in February, 1888, by Miss P. Catherine Bradford, of the Franklin School. 
In February, 1889, Granville B. Putnam, of the same school, brought the subject to 
tho attention of the masters, Asa result, a joint committee, consisting of 8 women 
and 8 men, was chosen, with authority to prepare a constitution and organize an 
association. Ata meeting of the committee held April 27, 1889, an organization was 
perfected and a constitution adopted under the laws of Massachusetts. 
In aid of the permanent fund of the association, a most successful bazaar was held 
in Music Hall for the week beginning December 5, 1892. The cooperation of public- 
spirited citizens, and especially of many of the philanthropic ladies of Boston, was 
secured, and as a result more than $56,000 was added to. the fund. Success has 
attended the association from the beginning. It has a membership of about 950 
and funds amounting to about $80,000. Most of this is invested in first mortgages 
in Boston and immediate vicinity. The income from assessments of members is 
about $8,000 a year and from investments nearly $4,000. The $12,000 of annual 
income thus secured is expended in annuities paid to disabled teachers, or those 
who, having taught for thirty-five years, desire to leave the service. About 50 
teachers have thus received annuities amounting to 40 per cent of their salaries at 
the time of resignation. 
But for this beneficent institution many of these teachers would still be in the 
employ of the city, althongh unable to do satisfactory work because of ill health or 
the infirmities of age. They have now given place to younger and more efficient 
teachers, and the city secures the benefit, while from the association they receive a 
comfortable income. Nor is this all. The nearly 1,000 members, feeling far less 
anxiety for the future because of membership, are daily doing better work than 
they could do if the shadows of coming adversities were ever resting upon them. 
Prompted by a wise forethought in guarding against their own possible necessities, 
as well as by a generous impulse to help associates in need, these teachers are banded 
together in the spirit of common brotherhood, a blessing to such of their number as 
shall avail themselves of its annuities, and a constant advantage to the schools which 
they have in charge.

7 PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. - 1081 
The following is the text of a pension law passed by the legislature 
of the State of Illinois. The teachers of Chicago had proposed it and

and employees as aforesaid, and shall have charge of and administer said fund, 
and shall have power to invest the same as shall be deemed most beneficial to said 
fund, in the same manner and subject to the same terms and conditions as township 
treasurers are permitted to invest school funds in article (4) of an act entitled ‘An 
act to establish and maintain a system of free schools” in force May 4, 1889, and

tributed under the law. 
Detroit, Mich.—The teachers of the city schools of Detroit secured 
provision for pensions from their State legislature in a clause of the 
school law passed in May, 1895, which contains the following provisions: 
Sec. 27. The said board of education shall establish what shall be known as the 
public school teachers’ retirement fund, which fund shall be administered according

retired teachers. any one who has taught in said schools for thirty years. The presi- 
dent and secretary of said board of education shall once in three months certify to 
the treasurer of said board all amounts deducted from the salaries of teachers in 
accordance with the provisions of this act, which amounts, as well as all other . 
moneys contributed to said fund, shall be set apart and held by the treasurer as a 
special fund hereinbefore specified, subject to the order of said board of education 
and superintendent of schools, and two representatives as aforesaid, and same shall 
be paid out upon warrants signed by the president and secretary of said board of 
education. It shall be the duty of said board, at the time it is required by law, to

  PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 1093 
Louisville, Ky., has an incorporated body known as the Louisville 
Educational Association. There has never been any attempt on the 
part of this association to pay pensions or annuities to teachers. It 
has, however, paid out quite a large suin of money in cases of sickness 
and death among the teachers. If a teacher in the Louisville public 
schools is taken sick and requires any aid, the association renders all 
necessary service in the way of paying for nurses, physicians, and, in 
the case of death, defraying funeral expenses. This is all that has been 
attempted to aid the teachers in Louisville, Ky. 
In Ohio the teachers are alive to the desirability of creating a pen- 
sion fund by authority of the State. They are at present petitioning 
the State legislature to pass a law similar to those in force in Illinois 
and Michigan. Their petition outlines the provisions requiring time of 
service and sources of pension fund, namely, twenty to thirty years of 
service and 1 per cent tax on teachers’ salaries. Like the teachers 
of other cities, those of Cincinnati maintain a society, with voluntary 
membership, which dates from 1891. This society pays an annuity to 
superannuated or retired teachers as well as aiding teachers in cases 
of sickness and death. In Cleveland a similar society pays sick ben- 
efits but not annuities. 
In Washington, D. C., and in Baltimore, Md., the teachers maintain 
voluntary societies. They have succeeded in raising funds by holding 
bazaars, the proceeds of which gave them a capital to start with. 
Milwaukee, Wis., Denver, Colo., Indianapolis, Ind., Pittsburg, Pa., 
Omaha, Nebr., Kansas City, Mo., and St. Paul, Minn., all report that 
neither State nor city authorities pay annuities; nor that the teachers 
have formed annuity societies. 
In New York a law concerning pensions to teachers in rural common 
schools is found in an addition to the general school law, which is 
entitled: 
AN ACT to provide conditional compensation for teachers of common schools in any town of the 
State who have taught therein continuously twenty-five years or more. 
The people of the State of New York, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as 
follows: 
Section 1. Upon the petition of twenty-five or more taxpayers of any town in 
the county of the State requesting the submission, at the next ensuing annual town 
meeting of such town, made not less than ten days before the accruing thereof, of 
the question of making provision by taxation upon the taxable property in such 
town for a sum of money sufficient to pay such teachers resident of such town, who 
have been employed in the common schools thereof for not less than twenty-five 
years, and have rendered continuous service in teaching for such period, with such 
intermission only as may have occurred in the allotment of school terms or from 
sickness, the town board of such town shall cause to be submitted to the taxpayers 
of such town, at the next ensuing town meeting, upon due notice thereof published 
in a newspaper printed in such town (if any paper be published therein), or printed 
or written notices posted in not less than ten public places in such town, the ques- 
tion whether a sufficient sum of money be raised from the taxable property within
-P-A-G-E-1152
  1094 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
such town to pay said teachers, as compensation for long and meritorious service, so 
long as said teachers reside in such town, upon the conditions, at the times, and in 
the manner hereafter provided. 
Src. 2. In the event of such petition being so made and presented to the supervi- 
sor of any town, and notice being given as provided in section one of this act, the 
town board shall furnish the necessary ballots in number and forms for the use of 
the voters of such town at the next ensuing annual town meeting, and shall provide 
separate ballot boxes for the reception of ballots cast thereat on the question sub- 
mitted. One-half of the number of said ballots shall have printed thereon, respec- 
tively, ‘‘for teachers’ pension fund,” and the other half shall have printed thereon, 
respectively, ‘‘against teachers’ pension fund,” and such votes as may be cast shall 
be counted and returned by the officers presiding at said town meeting the same as 
other votes are counted and returned. If a majority of the votes so cast be found 
to be in favor of raising a sum of money sufficient to provide for such fund, and not 
otherwise, the town board of such town shall immediately thereafter proceed to 
ascertain what teachers of such class are entitled to the benefits conferred by this 
act and to receive their proportionate share of the money so voted to be paid; and 
said board shall require of every person applying therefor, who has taught in the 
common schools of such town for the period of twenty-five years or more, to make 
concise statement of the term of service, the districts in which he or she has taught, 
and the wages, monthly or weekly, received during the last year in which said 
teacher taught; which statement shall be acknowledged before any officer qualified 
to take acknowledgments, and filed in the office of the clerk of such town. There- 
upon, and at the next annual mecting of the board of supervisors of the county, 
and at every annual meeting thereafter, the said board shall include in the tax levy 
of the town so voting as hereinbefore provided in favor of a teachers’ pension fund, 
the amount necessary in each year, as estimated and reported by the town board of 
such town; which sum, when collected, shall be paid over by the collector of such 
town to the supervisor thereof, who shall pay out the said money to the teachers 
found to be entitled thereto in amount to each such teacher, in monthly payments, 
equal to one-half the sum received as teachers’ monthly or weekly wages by each 
such teacher during the last year such teacher was employed to teach in the com- 
mon schools of such town. And such teachers sharing in the money so appropriated 
and paid shall be allowed such amount in installments herein provided as long as 
they continue to reside in such town, but no longer; and they shall, in receiving the 
benefits conferred by this act be deemed to be retired from teaching and placed upon 
aroll kept by the town clerk of the town as superannuated and retired teachers; 
subject, however, if not physically disabled, to perform such service in the place 
of any teacher temporarily absent or disqualified as the school commissioner may 
require and direct, without additional compensation. 
Src. 3. When a vote has been had on the proposition provided to be so submitted 
by this act in any town, and such vote shall have been against the teachers’ pension 
fund, anothor vote on the same question shall not be taken again within z three years 
of the first vote so taken. 
Sec. 4. This act shall take effect immediately. 
For the city of New York a special law exists which empowers the 
educational authorities of that city to retire men at the age of 60; 
women at the age of 55 years, or after 30 years’ service. This State 
law also empowers the board of education of that city to retain 1 
per cent of the teachers’ salaries. The law authorized the board of 
education of that city to retire, upon annuities, female teachers who 
have served in the city schools for 30 years or more, and male*teachers 
who have served 35 years or more; but no teacher can be so retired

PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 1095 
unless the city superintendent of schools shall first recommend the 
retirement, stating that “the teacher is mentally or physically inca- 
pacitated for the performance cf duty.” 
The “retirement fund” consists chiefly of the following, with the 
interest and income thereof: “(All money, pay, compensation or salary, 
or any part thereof, forfeited, deducted, or withheld from any teacher 
or teachers for or on account of absence from duty for any cause.” The 
law is here quoted in full. 
The people of the State of New York, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as 
follows: 
SEcrion 1. Section ten hundred and twenty-cight of chapter four hundred and 
ten of the laws of eighteen hundred and eighty-two, entitled ‘An act to consolidate 
into one act and to declare the special and local laws affecting public interests in 
the city of New York,” is hereby amended by adding thereto the following subdi- 
vision, to be known as subdivision seven of said section: 
7. The board of education of the city of New York is hereby given the general 
care and management of the public school teachers’ retirement fund created by 
this act. ; 
The comptroller of the city of New York shall hold all money belonging to said 
fund, and by the direction of the said board of education shall invest and pay out 
the same. 
The board of education shall have charge of and administer said public school 
teachers’ retirement fund as it shall deem most beneficial to said fund, and is empow- 
ered to make all necessary contracts, and take all necessary and proper action and 
proceedings in the premises, and to make payments from said fund of annuities 
granted in pursuance of this act; and shall from time to time establish such rules 
and regulations for the administration of said fund as it may deem best. And the 
comptroller of the city of New York shall report in detail to the board of aldermen 
of the city of New York annually, in the month of January, the condition of said 
fund, and the items of the receipts and disbursements on account of the same. 
The public school teachers’ retirement fund herein provided for shall consist of 
the following, with the interest and income thereof: 
(1) All money, pay, compensation or salary, or any part thereof, forfeited, deducted, 
or withheld from any teacher or teachers for and on account of absence from duty 
for any cause. The clerk of the board of education shall certify monthly to the comp- 
troller the amounts so deducted from the salaries of teachers during the preceding 
month. 
(2) All moneys received from donations, legacies, gifts, bequests, or otherwise, for 
and on account of said fund. 
(3) All such other methods of increment as may be duly and legally devised for 
the increase of said fund. 
On and after the passage of this act the board of education shall, by amending its 
by-laws relating to the excuse of absence of teachers with pay, so provide that the 
aggregate of the several sums deducted or forfeited on account of absence from 
duty shall be fully adequate to meet the demand made upon the public school 
teachers’ retirement fund, for the payment of annuities as herein provided. 
Said board of education shall have power, by a two-thirds vote of all its members, 
and after a recommendation to that effect shall have been made by the city superin- 
tendent of schools, stating that the teacher is mentally or physically incapacitated 
for the performance of duty, to retire any female teacher of the grammar and pri- 
mary schools, including special teachers in the same, who shall have taught therein 
during a period aggregating thirty years, and to retire any male teacher of said 
school who shall have taught therein during a period aggregating thirty-five years.
-P-A-G-E-1154
1096 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Any teacher so retired shall thereafter be entitled to receive as an annuity one- 
half the annual salary paid to said teacher at the date of said retirement, not to 
exceed, however, in any case the sum of $1,000 per annum. 
The board of education is hereby given the power to use both the principal and 
the income of said fund, and to manage, accumulate, and otherwise control the same 
as said board shall provide by its by-laws, and to pay the annuities hereinbefore 
mentioned, and shall have power from time to time to reduce the amount of annui- 
ties of all beneficiaries of said fund, provided only that such reduction shall be at 
the same rate per centum. 
Sec. 2. All acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed. 
Src. 3. This act shall take effect immediately. 
The superintendent of schools in the city of Buffalo, Mr. Henry P. 
Emerson, reports that there is a bill before the legislature of his State 
creating a retirement fund for public school teachers of Buffalo. This 
bill is here inserted because it shows decided differences from the 
special law passed for the city of New York. It contains no pro- 
vision for retiring a teacher for breakdown before the expiration of the 
limit of twenty-five years. The women teachers of Buffalo have 
formed a mutual benefit association which pays to members who 
become totally disabled, or to their heirs in case of death, a sum 
raised by.an assessment on each member of $1. The number of mem- 
bers is about 250. The following is the bill referred to, which has 
found the indorsement of the teachers of the city of Buffalo by a 
vote of 785 to 161: 
Section A. The mayor of the city of Buffalo, the superintendent of education, 
the chairman of the board of school examiners, the president of the Principals’ 
Association, and the president of the Women Teachers’ Association shall constitute 
a board of trustees, who shall have general care and management of the public 
school teachers’ retirement fund created by this act. 
Src. B. The said board of trustees is empowered to make payment from said fund 
of annuities granted in pursuance of this act, and to take all necessary and proper 
action in the premises, and from time to time establish such rules and regulations 
for the administration and investment of said fund as it may deem best. 
Src. C. The public school teachers’ retirement fund, created by this act, shall con- 
sist of the following moneys, to wit: 
1. An amount not to exceed one per cent per annum of the respective salaries paid to 
the superintendent of education, supervisors of grades, special teachers, principals, 
and assistant teachers, to be taken from said salaries in four equal installments. 
2, All moneys received from donations, legacies, gifts, bequests, or otherwise for 
and on account of said fund. 
8. All moneys which may be derived by such other methods as may be duly and 
legally devised for the increase of said fund. 
Src. D. All persons employed in the department of education and hereinafter 
mentioned as contributors to said fund shall become annuitants under this act in 
manner following, to wit: 
Any female teacher who shall have taught in public schools for 25 years, and any 
male teacher who shall have taught in public schools for 30 years may be retired by 
the superintendent and become an annuitant of this fund during life: Provided, how- 
ever, That four-fifths of such service shall have been rendered in the public schools of 
the city of Buffalo. 
And any female teacher who shall have taught in public schools 35 years, and any
-P-A-G-E-1155
PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 1097 
male teacher who shall have taught in public schools for 40 years, shall have the 
right to retire and become an annuitant of said fund during life: Provided, however, 
That four-fifths of such service shall have been rendered in the public schools of 
said city. 
Suc. E, Any teacher so retired or retiring shall receive as an annuity an amount 
not to exceed one-half of the annual salary paid to said teacher at the time of such 
retirement, said annuity to be paid quarterly: Provided, however, That such annuity 
shall not exceed the sum of six hundred dollars ($600) which shall be paid by the 
said board of trustees out of the fund created in accordance with this act, in the 
manner proyided by law for the payment of salaries. 
Sec. F, No teacher shall become an annuitant under this act until he or she shall 
have paid into the retirement fund an amount equal to 20 per cent of his or her 
annual salary at the time of retirement. 
Src. G. Said board of trustees is hereby given the power to use both the principal 
and the income of said fund for the payment of annuities hereinbefore mentioned, 
and shall have power to reduce, from time to time, the amount of all annuities: Pro- 
vided, That such reduction shall be at the same rate in all cases. 
Sec. H. If at any time a teacher who shall be willing to continue to teach shall 
net be reemployed or shall be discharged before the time when he or she would, 
under the provisions of this act, be entitled to an annuity, then such teacher shall be 
paid back all the money which may have been deducted from his or her salary under 
the provisions of this act. 
Suc. I. The superintendent of education shall, quarterly, in making the pay rolls 
for the school department or the persons entitled to share in the fund hereby created, 
deduct a sum not to exceed 1 per cent of the amount of salary of such persons, and 
shall certify the amount of such deductions and the names of the persons from 
whose salaries such deductions shall have been made; and such certificate shall 
accompany the pay roll, and a warrant for the amount of the deductions so certified 
shall be drawn payable to the order of the city treasurer, who shall retain the same 
subject to the disposal of the said board of trustees hereinbefore mentioned. 
Sec. J. The treasurer of the said city shall be custodian of said fund and he shall 
execute a bond to the city with good and sufficient securities to be approved by said 
board of trustees conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of his office. 
Such bond shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the city, and in case of a breach 
of the same or the conditions thereof, suit may be brought on the same in the name 
of the city for the use of said board or of any person or persons injured by such 
breach. The said treasurer shall report to the said board of trustees the amount 
and condition of said fund on June 30 of each year. 
This act shall take effect September 1, 1896. 
The retention of 1 per cent of the salaries per month seems to be gen- 
erally accepted as the proper premium. Portions of the constitution of 
the Teachers’ Mutual Benefit Association of the city of New York are 
here inserted owing to their peculiar fitness for the purposes for which 
they are intended.

‘In Brooklyn, N. Y., the teachers have formed a society (entirely 
voluntary), but its funds are not yet adequate to pay annuities. 
_ In St. Louis, Mo., the first steps toward the establishment of an annu- 
ity fund have been taken; the State legislature has authorized the 
board of public schools to establish such a fund; the money is to be 
supplied by a voluntary tax of about 1 per cent on salaries paid.! 
= In California a State law exists for the purpose of creating and 
administering a “‘ Public school teachers’ annuity and retirement fund 
in the several counties and cities of the State.” Up to January 1, 1896, 
six teachers have retired under this law. This being a general law for 
the entire State, it seems desirable to publish it in full. 
The people of ithe State of California, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as 
follows: 
Section 1. The superintendent of public schools, the county treasurer, and the 
chairman of the board of supervisors of each county, or city and county, and their suc- 
cessors in office, are hereby constituted a board of irustecs of the ‘‘ School teachers’ 
annuity and retirement fund,” to provide for the disbursement of the same, and to 
‘designate the beneficiaries thereof, as hereinafter directed, which board shall be 
known as the “School teachers’ retirement fund commissioners.” 
Src. 2. They shall organize as such board by choosing one of their number as 
chairman and one as secretary. The county treasurer shall be ex officio treasurer of 
such fund. Such board of trustees shall have charge of and administer said fund 
and order payments therefrom according to the provisions of this act. They shall   
1The Missouri State legislature, in March, 1895, passed an act authorizing the 
teachers and the school board of St. Louis to organize for the purpose of providing 
incapacitated teachers with pensions or annuities. By this act female teachers who 
have served twenty-five years and male teachers who have served thirty years are 
entitled to annuities, which are derived from (a) a deduction of not exceeding 1 per 
cent of the teachers’ salaries, (b) donations, bequests, ete., (¢) money derived from 
other legal methods of increment. The teachers of St. Louis are about to organize 
under said act. The relief fund is to be controlled by a board of trustees, to consist 
of the superintendent of public schools, four members of the school board chosen 
by that body, and two representatives chosen by the teachers who may signify their 
desire to become members of the organization.
-P-A-G-E-1159

report annually in the month of July to the board of supervisors the condition of 
such fund, and the receipts and the disbursements on account of the same, with a 
full and complete list of the beneficiaries of said fund, and the amounts paid to each 
of them. 
Src. 8. Whenever any teacher entitled to the benefits of this act has taught in the 
public schools of this State for a period of twenty years, and shall become incapaci- 
tated from performing the duties of a teacher, such teacher shall, at his or her 
request, and may, in the discretion of the board of school trustees, without such 
request, be retired as a teacher, and shall thereafter receive an annuity out of said 
fund of forty-five dollars per month; and if such teacher has taught for twenty-five 
years or over, shall, under the same circumstances, be retired upon an annuity of 
fifty dollars per month, such payments to be made out of the fund in the different 
counties in proportion to the length of time taught by such teacher in each county; 
but in case any teacher should be retired within three years after the passage of this 
act, he or she must, in order to receive the benefits thereof, pay into the fund pro- 
vided for in this act the sum of three hundred dollars; And provided further, Thatif 
at any time there shall not be sufficient money in said fund to pay the warrants 
drawn thereon as presented for payment, the treasurer shall register said warrants, 
and mark on the back of each these words: ‘Presented for payment this —— (giving 
day, month, and year) and not paid for want of funds.” 
Treasurer of County. 
And such warrants shall be paid in the order of registration and bear interest at five 
per cent per annum from date of registration. 
Src. 4. The board herein provided for shall hold quarterly meetings on the chicd 
Saturday of January, April, July, and October of each year at the office of the 
county superintendent of public schools. Such board shall biennially, at the meet- 
ing in January, select from its members a president and secretary. It shall issue 
warrants, signed by its president and secretary, to the persons entitled thereto for 
the amount of money ordered paid to such persons from such fund by said board, 
stating therein for what purpose such payments are made, It shall keep arecord of 
all its proceedings, which shall be public. It shall at each quarterly meeting send 
to the treasurer of the county, or city and county, and to the auditor of such county, 
or city and county, a list of all persons, if any, entitled to payment out of the fund 
provided in this act, stating the amount of such payments and for what granted, 
which lists shall be sworn to as correct by the president and secretary of said board,

Pensions paid to teachers in Hurope.—A review of the pension laws in 
force in European countries will show that in Europe the conviction is 
prevalent that it is a wise policy to pension teachers. It aids in estab- 
lishing the profession of teaching, and thus aids materially in securing 
good results in public education, which otherwise might not be secured. 
All European countries follow this policy except Spain and Great 
Britain; but in Great Britain the teachers themselves have recently 
established a union which in form of a mutual aid society pays annuities 
to disabled teachers. A similar enterprise is on foot among the teachers 
of other states where pensions are granted by the government, so that 
Spain is the only country where the teachers have no hope for relief in 
old age or in case of breakdown. ‘ 
The German states may be mentioned first. All the 26 states that 
form the German Empire pay pensions both to teachers and their widows 
and orphans. Their pension funds are nearly one hundred years old. 
The conditions of the various funds are not the same throughout the 
country. In Prussia, for example, the fund is formed by the state and 
the community, and the teachers pay a nominal annual premium. 
Early breakdown, say after ten years, is usually met by an annuity 
equal to one-fourth, and the maximum pension is fixed at three-fourths 
of the salary. In every case a teacher is obliged to pay as an entrance 
fee the first month’s salary of his definite employment; after that the 
fee is very trifling, and the state bears not less than one-half of all the 
expenditures for pensions. But in Germany there exists a provision 
stranger than can be found in the whole of the examination of this 
question. The community may recover part of its contribution to the 
pension of its teacher from the salary of his successor. A system of 
 
-P-A-G-E-1161
PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 1103 
compulsory retirement produces a steady flow of promotion, but it seems 
hard for a teacher to be fined for his own promotion. The teachers’ 
unions, which are quite numerous and which form a national union num- 
bering some 65,000 members, make a series of contributions toward a 
fund for life insurance, and this is paid out in the form of an annuity 
to the family of the contributor. It is a characteristic of the parental 
government of the states in Germany that defaulters of pensions and 
defrauders of pension funds are not known in the history of the fund 
since its beginning. 
In Austria the pension schemes vary in different parts (crown lands) 
of the Empire. One example will suffice: The teachers pay annually 
2 per cent of their salary, and the first tenth of the first year’s salary, 
as well as the first tenth of every increase; the remainder of the fund 
is supplied by the state and the communities. The pensions vary from 
a fixed amount equal to one and one-half times the salary paid once 
for all when incapacitated after less than ten years’ service to an annuity 
of the full salary after forty years’ service. Annual payments are also 
made to the widow and children of any teacher, no matter what length 
of service; the amount thus paid varying from one-fourth to a little 
more than one-half of the salary enjoyed by the teacher at his death. 
The policy of pensioning teachers in Austria proper—that is, the Ger- 
man portion of the Austrian Empire—is as old as it is in Germany, 
Austria having been a part and parcel of Germany and of the German 
Confederation until 1866. 
In the other part of the Austrian Empire, in Hungary, the pension 
scheme dates from 1875. During the first three years the Government 
gave a subsidy of $25,000 annually, of $50,000 each for the next three 
years, and after that a yearly donation of $75,000. The teacher worn 
out at an early age finds relief, and 40 per cent of the husband’s pen- 
sion passes to the widow and children. Here there is a sort of sur- 
render value given, but only on proof of inability to continue in the 
service. It is small in amount and limited to the first ten years of 
service. After that time provision for superannuation comes into play. 
Sweden,! Norway,’ and Denmark,’ and also most of the cantons of 
Switzerland have recognized the advisability of removing worn-out. 
teachers. In Russia‘ the teachers in town schools also may look for- 
ward to a pension. It seems to be the general policy in Russia, as well 
as in the western countries, to secure a long tenure of office to the 
teachers whom the state has prepared for their profession. In Ger- 
many it is claimed that the teacher being an officer of the state must 
owe his professional preparation to the state, and the prospect of being 
pensioned will prevent him from deserting the profession, for contri. 
butions to the pension fund are never returned in case the teacher 
leaves the profession. ‘

  1104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
Holland has had a state scheme of pensioning teachers since the year 
1878, and teachers can claim retirement with a pension if incapacitated 
after ten years of service, or for old age at 65. The pension is calculated 
at the rate of one-sixtieth of the last year’s salary for eight years of 
service up to a maximum of two-thirds of the salary. To provide a 
fund for this purpose the teachers contribute 2 per cent of their sal- 
aries and the state provides the remainder. Two per cent paid from 
the twentieth to the sixty-fifth year of age will purchase an annuity 
equal to 38 per cent of the salary on which the deduction has been 
made. Every pension received before reaching the age of 65 must be 
paid entirely by the state, as well as a large portion of all pensions paid 
at the age of 65. There is no repayment, and voluntary efforts on the 
part of the teachers have secured annuities for widows and orphans. 
In Belgium the fund is formed in this way: Two-fifths is paid by the 
community, two-fifths by the state, one-fifth by the province, and noth- 
ing by the teacher. The pension may reach $1,000 per annum. The 
amount of annuity is calculated at the rate of one fifty-fifth of the 
average of last five years’ salary for every year of service, together 
with this peculiar addition: The possession of certain certificates, i. e., 
for drawing, music, etc., counts for further years of service to a maxi- 
mum of four. Teachers may retire after five years of service if inca- 
pacitated through school work, but if not so disabled the superannua- 
tion begins at the age of 50 with thirty years of service; or at the age 
of 60 with only fifteen years’ service. The teachers contribute nothing 
to the pension fund, and naturally they have no claim on it for repay- 
ments of any sort; but the moment they commence to receive salary 
from cither of the contributing bodies mentioned above they are com- 
pelled to submit to a deduction of about 4 per cent of their salaries to 
provide a fund for the widows and orphans. The widow of a teacher 
who had seen thirty years’ service would receive from this fund an 
annuity equal to 36 per cent of the husband’s average salary. A 
smaller amount is paid for each minor child. 
In France the teachers are on the same footing as other servants of 
the state; the salaries are paid subject to a deduction of 5 per cent, 
plus one-twelfth of the first year’s salary, plus one-twelfth of each 
increase of salary for the first year of such increase. This second form 
of deduction is productive of great evil. A teacher does not receive 
any salary until the end of the second month after his appointment, 
and it is said that they are frequently compelled during that time to 
contract debts with all their consequent worry and degradation, Asa 
rule, the pension is payable after thirty years’ service, the other factor 
being incapacity or 60 years of age. The amount of pension depends 
on years of service—one-sixtieth of the average of the last six years 
for every year served. There is some provision for meeting the case of 
those who break down while employed, but itis small in amount and 
surrounded by a multitude of conditions. The widow of a teacher may 
receive one-third of the pension to which her husband would be entitled.

PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 1105 
In Italy teachers have but recently enjoyed the aavantages of pen- 
sions, payments from the fund beginning in the year 1889, For ten 
years prior to this contributions were being made in order to form a 
capital sum from which to commence payments. The communities, 
provinces, and the state each paid to the central fund 5 per cent on the 
minimum salary of the various grades of teachers, and during the same 
period the teachers paid either 3 per cent or 2 per cent, according to 
the age of the contributor. In addition to this the state appropriated 
a subsidy of $60,000 per annum during these ten years. The contribu- 
tions have now reached their normal seale of 2 per cent on the minimum 
salary, such amounts being paid by each of the contributing bodies 
mentioned above, or 8 per cent in all. The pensions are, as a rule, 
payable when the teacher reaches the age of 60 with forty years’ ser- 
vice, or 65 with thirty-five years’ service; the amount of the annuity 
should be noted, for it is equal to the average salary of the last five 
years. Cases of difficulty are here also recognized. It is seen that 
something must be done to meet the requirements of those who break 
down before reaching the pension age of 60, and therefore a reduced 
scale of superannuation is applied to those who have seen twenty-five 
years’ service. With less than twenty-five years’ service the teacher 
has no claim, nor does any provision appear to exist for repayment of 
contributions at,death, or for any annuity for the family of the deceased. 
In Greece teachers contribute 5 per cent on the salaries, and the 
state finds the remainder in order to superannuate teachers after 
twenty-one years’ service, regardless of age. , 
In Portugal provisions are made for pensioning those engaged in edu- 
cation, but the details are not available, except this one fact, that no 
arrangements are made for meeting the requirements of the deceased 
teachers’ families. 
From the foregoing exposé it is seen that there is no uniform scheme 
of pensioning, but they all seem to follow leading principles, namely, 
that thirty-five to forty years is the average maximum of teachers’ serv- 
ice, and 60 to 65 years the maximum of age. The amount of pension 
varies from one-third to the whole of the teachers’ average salary. 
Generally it is found that where a pension scheme is maintained that 
there also pensions are paid to the widows and orphans. 
This Bureau is indebted to the State Department for a statement on 
Government pensions for public teachers in Belgium, sent by Hon. 
George W. Roosevelt, United States consul at Brussels. The document 
is here subjoined, because it offers an insight into the minutic of the 
pension laws in force in that country: 
Government pensions for public school teachers in Belgium.—In 1842 there was estab- 
lished in this Kingdom a fund destined to pay pensions to retired or disabled public 
school teachers. 
The fund was supported by reserving a certain percentage of the yearly salary of 
each employee of the public schools. On May 16, 1872, there was a law passed sup- 
pressing this fund, and making the Government responsible for such pensions; that 
 
-P-A-G-E-1164
  1106 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
is, the State was taxed two-fifths, the province one-fifth, and the commune two-fifths 
of the amount necessary for the appropriation without permitting contributionfrom 
the parties interested. Those entitled to enjoy the benefit of this law are teachers 
who have served thirty years, and who are 50 years of age. Ten years’ service and 
incurable disease preventing the teacher from ever resuming his functions, or five 
years’ service and incurable infirmity received in the discharge of his duty, or 60 
years of age, with fifteen years’ service, entitle to the pension. Professors of secondary 
Government schools enjoy the same rates of pension, except in cases of infirmity, 
when the beneficiary must have arrived at the age of 55 years. Tho pension is cal- 
culated by years of service at the rate of one fifty-fifth per cent of the average salary 
during the last five years of active work. Teachers and professors connected with 
the high schools are retired and pensioned when permanently incapacitated on 
account of infirmities coming from acceptably performing their duty, or when they 
have attained the age of 70 years. 
Professors and other members of the teachers’ corps of the Government universi- 
ties or special schools annexed thereto, normal, grammar, and scientific schools, 
veterinary and agricultural schools, as well as civil professors and other members of 
the civil corps connected with the Government military schools, are entitled to 
pension, as well as Government inspectors of State universities, directors and inspec- 
tors of classes in special schools annexed to Government universities, directors of 
normal, grammar, and scientific, veterinary, and agricultural schools. When these 
functionaries have reached the age limit they may, if they desire, be authorized to 
continue their labors or certain courses as they may elect. The authorization to 
continue duty is at all times revocable. 
When they may ask to be retired.—When they have had thirty years’ academic 
service, irrespective of age; when they have reached the age of 70 years and have 
had ten years’ academic service;-after twenty years’ academic ‘service if suffering 
from permanent and serious infirmity. 
The retired pension is estimated by the amount of salary and extra pay received 
during tho last five years of active service. 
Professors and other members of the teachers’ corps who on account of infirmities 
are prevented from continuing their functions, but not having reached the age limit 
or number of years of service requisite to demand pension, may be pensioned irre- 
spective of age, after five years’ service. The pension for such applicants, likewise 
for professors and others who have reached the age of 70 years, but are not entitled 
to be retired, is estimated and rated at one-sixth of the salary and extra pay received 
during the last five years of service. 
Each year of academic service above five years is rated at y's per cent over and 
above the salary. 
No pension can exceed the average or mean salary which serves as a basis of 
estimation. 
Widows and orphans’ pension fund.—There is established in the department of pub- 
lic instruction, under the immediate supervision of the minister of the interior, 
a pension fund for the benefit of widows and orphans of professors, teachers, and 
employees connected with all public institutions of learning in Belgium. 
‘The fund is maintained by a yearly assessment on the salary of each person con- 
nected with the Government or public schools. The fund is administered by a coun- 
cil composed of seven members, as follows: A secretary-general, or director-general, 
acting as president and appointed from the department of public instruction, ono 
member selected from among the academy professors, two members from the inter- 
mediate schools, one from the primary schools, and two chosen indiscriminately from 
among the contributors. The members of*the council are appointed by royal decreo 
for the term of six years. The commissions are, however, always revocable. 
All the rules formulated by the council are subjected to the approval of the minis- 
ter of public instruction. All salaries, or extra salaries, incidental or extra pay of
-P-A-G-E-1165
PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 1107 
professors, teachers, supernumeraries, and substitutes connected with Government 
ov public schools are assessed as follows for the benefit of the fund: 
Salary of 3,000 francs (#579) or more, 3 per cent; salary of less than 3,000 francs, 
2} percent. Teachers who have not contributed to the fund, and whose compensa- 
tion amounts to 1,200 francs ($231.60) per year, are taxed one month’s pay, or if less 
than this amount, fourteen days’ pay. 
In the event of increase of salary, extra salary, incidental or extra pay, the first 
two months of such compensation is deducted for the benefit of the fund, as well as 
all sums derived from leave of absence, absence, or disciplinary punishment. 
When functionaries of the schools are already married or marry subsequently, and 
desire to participate in the fund, they must submit to a yearly assessment of 1} per 
cent on their salary, extra salary, incidental or extra pay, during ten years, com- 
mencing from the first day of the month following his marriage, or from entry upon 
duty if married. After the expiration of the ten years the functionary continues to 
pay a permanent tax of 1 per cent; also an additional tax of 1 per cent for each 
year’s service prior to marriage. The last sum is calculated on all compensations 
which the functionary may have received before his marriage, or, according to the 
case, from his assumption of duty. If, however, a written declaration is made of 
the intended marriage, or expected appointment three months prior to either event, 
a sinaller percentage is deducted. 
In case of death or divorce of the wife, the amount of 1 per cent following the ten 
years ceases after the first of the month following the death or divorce. In case of 
death of a contributor, leaving a widow entitled to pension, the amount deducted 
from the salary of the contributor is estimated by the 1} per cent paid during ten 
years, as well as the 1 per cent following. If the total exceeds, or falls short of, the 
amount of one year’s pension for the widow the difference is deducted or added. If, 
however, the contributor has not fulfilled his obligations to the fund, 10 per cent is 
deducted from the widow’s pension until such obligations have been paid in full. 
To a great extent the amount received by a widow is estimated by the difference 
in ago existing between her and her late husband. For instance, if there is a ditfer- 
ence of from twenty to twenty-five years, a deduction of 1 per cent is made, from 
twenty-five to thirty years 1} per cent, from thirty to thirty-five years 2 per cent. 
Contributors cease to pay into the fund at date of death or divorce of wife, unless 
there are minor children under 18 years of age. 
Functionaries actually in service who may anticipate marriage, or for those desir- 
ing to contribute who may be thirty-five years older than the wife, neither the widow 
of such contributor nor children issue of said marriage are entitled to pension. 
During marriage, or after dissolution of same, and until the children have reached 
the age of 18 years, a deduction is made on the retired pension of contributors as 
follows: two per cent if the pension is or exceeds 2,000 francs ($386), 1} if the pension 
is from 1,000 ($193) to 2,000 franes ($386). 
Contributors who may resign, be dismissed or suspended from their functions, and 
who desire to reserve the right to pension for wives and children, must within six 
months following the severance froma duty, promise to pay quarterly in advance to 
the fund a sum equivalent to the amount assessed on their last salary. 
Right to pension.—No widow is entitled to pension unless the functionary has con- 
tributed during five years to a fund established by the Government for widows, nor if 
the marriage was less than three years, unless there are children issue of said marriage. 
If a woman marries a functionary who may have resigned or been dismissed, 
and if there are children issue of such marriage, neither mother nor children are 
entitled to pension, Children of contributors, whether by first or second marriage, 
are entitled to pension as orphans until they are 18 years old, where there is no 
widow admissible to pension, and where the contributor has subscribed to the fund 
during five years. 
When the wife of a functionary dies after having contributed to the fund for five 
 
-P-A-G-E-1166
  1108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-95. 
years or less, and at her death leaves minor children, they are entitled to pension 
from the mother’s contributions even though the father still lives. If the husband 
is also a contributor the children are, at his death, entitled to pension by reason of 
the amount paid into the fund by him, notwithstanding the fact that they receive a 
pension from the mother’s contribution. Only legitimate or legitimatized children 
are entitled to pension. Widows and orphans of functionaries deceased through 
accident or infirmities incurred in the discharge of their duty, independent of length 
of service, are entitled to pension. 
Basis of pension.—The average pension is fixed at 16 per cent of the average salary. 
It is increased 1 per cent of the salary for contributions for cach year after ten years. 
This increase, however, is not permitted to exceed 100 francs ($19.30) per year. 
A divorced woman or widow who remarries forfeits all right to pension. When a 
widow is no longer entitled to pension the children enjoy the rights to same, exactly 
as if they were orphaned of both mother and father. 
Application for pension is addressed to the minister of public instruction and must 
contain the address of either the widowed applicant, the guardian of the orphans or 
minor children. 
The widow without minor children incloses copies of certificates of her birth and 
birth of deceased husband, certificate of marriage, as well as certificate of death of 
husband, and a legalized certificate from the communal authorities testifying that the 
marriage was not dissolved by divorce. A widow having children under 18 years of 
age incloses in her application, besides the certificates above mentioned, certificates 
of, birth of children and certificates showing that the children are still living. 
, A guardian for the orphans incloses in his application similar certificates. The 
length of time permitted wherein to file application for pension is three years from 
date of death. Payments are made quarterly and commence from the first day of 
the month following date of death. 
The widow upon drawing pension must produce the following papers: Certificate 
of life; certificate showing that she has notremarried. If she has children under 18 
years of age, a certificate stating that each child is alive. 
Donations and legacies made to the fund are accepted by the minister of public ~ 
instruction, under the rules prescribed for acceptance of donations and legacies to 
public institutions. 
Gro. W. ROOSEVELT, 
= United States Consul. 
UNITED STATES CONSULATE, 
Brussels, November 12, 1895. 
The daily press of the United States has taken up the question of 
“paying pensions to civil officers,” and discusses it with all fairness, but 
rarely adds any new facts or arguments either in support or opposition 
to pensions. The Newark (N. J.) Evening News, however, published 
(May 20, 1896) an article prepared by one of the most competent insur- 
ance experts, who is likewise thoroughly informed on the various phases 
of public education. The article refers to the law in New Jersey and is 
here reproduced on account of the well-arranged mathematical caleu- 
lations it contains. The author claims that the fund created by the 
retention of 1 per cent of the teachers’ salaries is insufficient to meet 
the demands which will inevitably be made upon it in future. A much 
higher percentage of contributions, he thinks, is necessary if it is to 
meet its promises; and he argues that State aid will have to be 
invoked, or large outside contributions be received, to make the pen- 
sion fund a success. The editor discusses the article at length. Since  
-P-A-G-E-1167
  
PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 1109 
his comments seem to reflect public opinion, they are here inserted also 
at the close of the article: 
In view of the fact that during the next two or three weeks the public-school 
teachers of Newark must decide whether or not they will avail themselves of the 
recent State law providing for a retirement fund, it may be of some value to con- 
sider tho plan of this law in a practical way and see if it can accomplish all that is 
claimed for it. 
In the first place, there can be no reference to any other experience in which the 
conditions sufficiently resemble the present ones to form a precedent. Two or three 
States have passed teachers’ pension laws, but so recently that as yet no data from 
that source are available. In Europe the retirement of teachers under pensions has 
been going on for many years—in one country for eighty years, at least. But there 
the State provides all, or almost all, of the fund. The societies merely supplement 
the work done by the Government. 
In all of the following European States provision is made from the State funds for 
pensions for teachers: England, Scotland, France, Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, Austria- 
Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, 
Sweden, Finland. In New Jersey, however, there is no assurance of help from the 
State, and we must look at the plan of the fund itself to see how much it will do for 
those who put their trust in it. 
Tho general plan of the ‘‘teachers’ retirement fund” is this: Teachers desiring to 
receive the benefits under the law shall subscribe 1 per cent of their salaries 
monthly as long as they remain in the school service. Subscribers who have taught 
twenty years may, upon being judged incapacitated for teaching, with or without 
their own request, be retired upon an annuity of half their average annual salary 
for the last five years of teaching. This annuity, however, must not excced $600 
nor be less than $250, and teachers of twenty years’ standing retiring under this 
plan within five years of the establishment of the fund must pay 20 per cent of 
their annual salary upon retiring.- Teachers resigning after being subscribers five 
years or more may withdraw one-half of all they have paid in. Provision is also 
made for the possible emergency of there being no money on hand to pay the annui- 
ties as they falldue. They are to be paid in their order, as soon as there is a suf- 
ficient amount on hand, together with 5 per cent interest from the date when due. 
It is the object of this article to estimate the progress of this fund for the next 
twenty years, and Newark as the largest city in the State will serve as a good illus- 
tration, especially as there are at hand as data tho reports of the city board of 
education since 1856. 
One’s first impression from a cursory reading of the law is that the whole scheme 
is absurd. One per cent of a salary for twenty, thirty, or forty years surely can not 
pay for 50 per cent of a larger salary for life after age 40, 50, or 60. The average sal- 
ary of Newark teachers, of both sexes, at the end of 1895, was a little less than $791. 
Tho average salary of those who have taught twenty years is more than $900. One 
per cent of $791, for, say, thirty years, amounts, with compound interest at 5 per cent, 
to $552, while, supposing the age of the teacher at appointment to have been 20, the 
value of an annuity of $450 at ago 50, using the same rate of interest, is $5,547. 
Even if we suppose the teacher to have been active for forty years, 1 per cent of 
salary on the samo basis would amount to $1,003, as against $4,381, the value of the 
annuity. 
In the foregoing illustrations, however, there has not been taken into account the 
money left in the treasury, because of the many who resign or die before earning an 
annuity, and who take with them from the fund either nothing at all or one-half of 
what they have paid in. In the table given below an attempt has been made to 
illustrate the working of the scheme for the next twenty years in Newark, introduc- 
ing all the elements of income and outgo. If any exaggeration has been indulged 
in, it has been in favor of the scheme rather than against it.

It has been assumed in the table that all the teachers would join in the enterprise. 
If any do not join, they will naturally be the ones who would have to pay longest, 
and whose need of the annuity seems most remote, and not those who may expect 
to become incapacitated soonest. 
Columns 2 and 3 represent the probable number of teachers and their salaries on 
the basis of the increase since 1886. Column 4 is the annual cost to the members, 1 
per cent of their salaries. Column 5 represents 29 per cent of the annual salaries of 
those adjudged incapacitated during thé first five years. Column 6 shows the total 
amount paid into the fund from the beginning. 
Column 7 represents the number having taught twenty years or more and eligible 
for annuities, caleulated from the reports of the city superintendent. They are 20 
per cent of the entire number employed,-less those who have commenced to draw 
annuities. Column 8 is an estimate of the number who would commence to draw 
annuities each year. It is supposed that one-twentieth, or 5 per cent, of those 
eligible for annuities would become incapacitated. 
Columns 9 show the amounts drawn by annuitants, on the supposition that their 
average annual salaries during their last five years of teaching were $900, and that 
one annuitant in each group dies every other year. Column 10 is the estimated 
number that would resign after teaching from five to nineteen years. Column 11 
shows the amounts drawn out by those represented in column 10. It is supposed 
that the first group going out have paid into the fund for five years, the second 
group six years, and the rest seven years. The number of years is under rather 
than over estimated. Column 12 shows the amount paid out of the fund each year, 
and 13 the total amount paid out from the beginning. 
A comparison of columns 6 and 13 shows that after the second year the disburse- 
ments exceed the receipts, and that before the end of the fifth year the fund is 
exhausted. After ten years the total receipts are almost $35,000 less than the total 
disbursements, and are falling behind at the rate of $7,000 per year. In twenty 
years the liabilities are $144,000 greater than the assets, taking no account of interest 
on unpaid annuities, and the debt is growing larger at the rate of $13,500 yearly. 
In order to meet all obligations, it would be necessary to get from outside sources 
an annual sum of money gradually increasing and averaging $7,000 a year for the 
twenty years. As the law applies to the whole State, it seems not improbable that 
there would soon develop an average annual deficit of at least $20,000. It is said 
that fairs are to be held throughout the State and donations solicited in order to 
meet any deficiencies. It is, to say the least, extremely doubtful whether these 
large amounts can be raised annually in such uncertain ways.
-P-A-G-E-1170
  1112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
It should be remembered that in this investigation all estimates are purposely 
made very favorable to the plan of the fund. For example, in the table it appears 
that 15 teachers will commence to draw annuities during the first three years, while 
the probabilities are that at least 30 would doso. As a matter of fact, $40,000 a 
year, rather than $20,000, would represent the annual deficit throughout the State 
if the only source of income were the 1 per cent of the teachers’ salaries. 
Surely the plan can not commend itself as being founded on sound business prin- 
ciples. More than half tho income needed to meet obligations is provided for only 
by hopes. Possibly those who urged the passage of the bill before the legislature 
expect the State to go farther in the future, and make an annual appropriation as 
a pension fund. However this may be, the teachers of the State who go into the 
scheme should realize that they have no guarantee whatever that their annuities 
will be paid when due, or even that they can draw out half of their contributions 
if they resign after five years. 
If the law provided that Newark and Jersey City and perhaps two or three others 
of the larger cities could haye separate organizations, sufficient local pride and 
enthusiasm might be aroused to secure to the fund large amounts through donations 
and entertainments, but it will be hard to stir up so much interest when it is known 
that all extra money raised will go into the gencral State fund. 
‘There is a flourishing Teachers’ Annuity and Aid Association in Philadelphia. 
It was established December 20, 1890, and is therefore less than five and a half years 
old. It has 885 members enrolled, and although it did not commence to pay annui- 
ties until it was three years old, there are now seventy-two annuitants on its books. 
The fact that this association is strictly local has been one reason, no doubt, for the 
liberal donations it has received from the citizens of Philadelphia. But even with 
such large contributions from outside friends and with a State appropriation of 
$20,000, the charge for membership is 2 per cent of all salarics up to and includ- 
ing $1,000, and 1 per cent of higher salaries. 
Nothing has been said in this article of the provision made by the law for the 
manner of deciding whether or not a teacher is incapacitated, although the method 
is open to criticism; neither has any substitute for the present plan been suggested. 
It might be said concerning the latter that at least 5 per cent of the teachers’ 
salaries would be necessary to establish the fund on a sound financial basis. 
Following are the comments of the editor of the Evening News, of 
Newark, N. J.: 
THE TEACHERS’ RETIREME 
  LAW. 
In another column of the News there appears an analysis of the probable income 
and expenditures of the proposed teachers’ retirement fund as applied to this city. 
It is made up according to the figures and statistics by which an insurance or 
annuity company would calculate the results of attempting to do business on such 
aplan. It shows, what has been apparent from the start, that the fund raised 
under the law will not be self-sustaining; that it will be pitifully inadequate to 
meet the demands likely to be made upon it. In this city it must also be borne in 
mind that the conditions are more favorable than they would be in the State at 
large. The calculations give every advantage to the fund. There is no sentiment 
about the mathematics of insurance and annuities, but the formulw and the meth- 
ods which are employed in arriving at conclusions in regard to business of that kind 
have experience back of them, and reliance can be placed upon their results. 
It is true that those who have been most active in securing legislation providing 
for this fund admit its inadequacy. They believe that by giving fairs and enter- 
tainments and enlisting the support of those who are interested in the public schools 
and the teachers large amounts of money can be raised. They hope for additional 
legislation and for State appropriations. The law was obviously intended as an
-P-A-G-E-1171
PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 1113 
entering wedge for a system of pensioning of teachers. It was passed, however, 
after repeated attempts to secure the enactment of a teachers’ pension law had 
failed, and one of the pleas made in its behalf by its advocates was that it would 
simply lend the aid of the State to an effort by the teachers to themselves provide 
for those among their number who might be forced to retire after years of faithful 
service. Is it likely that the State will come to the aid of the fund by making 
appropriations’ for pensions? 
The question of the advantages to teachers and to the public offered by a teach- 
ers’ pension fund it is needless to discuss. With here and theré a rare and devoted 
exception, men and women who teach school follow that occupation because it is the 
best and most available means that they have to earn their livings. To pay higher 
salaries or to provide pensions would mako positions in the public schools more 
desirable. The latter plan would enable educational authorities to retire superan- 
nuated teachers without feeling that the act was a cruel one, or would bring suffer- 
ing to those who could no longer do their accustomed work. 
To go that far, or, on the other hand, to say that teachers, like workers in other 
fields, ought to try by care and frugality to provide for their own old age, is to cover 
tho grounds of the controversy over the question whether pensions should or should 
not be paid by the public to school teachers. 
Apart from its failure to promise to be self-supporting, the scheme outlined by the 
law has twoobjections. One is that the law makes a teacher once a contributor 
always a contributor, as long as he or she remains in the public-school] service. 
There is no way provided for those who have agreed to contribute to stop contribut- 
ing, even though it should appear speedily that only those first retired had any 
prospect of getting annuities. The other point of unfairness is that in the event of 
a deficiency, the plan isnot to divide the money proportionately among those entitled 
to receive it, but to pay the claims in full in order of priority, letting later appli- 
cants wait for their money. Both of these defects could be corrected by legislation; 
and teachers who think that they should be corrected, and who join in contributing 
to the fund, would do well to express their opinion. If those who start the move- 
ment unite in demanding changes obviously dictated by fairness and proper regard 
for others, the amendment of the law in those respects can no doubt be relied upon. 
Teachers who believe that the State will aid this fund, or that private assistance 
will come in liberally, together with those who desire to assist their fellow-teachers, 
even if they do not themselves expect to derive any benefit, near or remote, will 
doubtless join the association. It may succeed in securing the help that will fairly 
put it on its feet and make it a strong reliance for teachers, an efficient ally of 
the public-school system, but those who join should do it with their eyes open to 
the crudity and insufficiency of the plan as it stands alone, and to the fact that it 
must be greatly supplemented if it is to succeed. It is fair to say that Miss Allen, 
the foremost champion of the law, dwelt with force upon this aspect of the case in 
the address which she delivered in this city last week.

COEDUCATION. 
United States.—The report of the Commissioner for 1891-82 presented 
a detailed statement as to the policy of coeducation, or the education 
of the two sexes in the same class, as practiced in the schools and col- 
leges of the United States. To sum up briefly the facts as there pre- 
sented, it appears that in the elementary or public schools of the 
United States boys and girls are educated together. The only excep- 
tions to this rule are found in a few cities,! less apparently than 6 per 
cent of the total number. Even in these cities separation seldom takes 
place below the high school. 
In the few cases in which boys and girls are instructed separately 
in the lower grades the system has generally resulted from the original 
plan or location of the building, and is regarded as a necessary evil. 
San Francisco affords the only notable example of a system of city 
schools in which the separate instruction of boys and girls is maintained 
and advocated as the wisest course. 
Considering private schoels, it appears that coeducation is the policy 
in nearly two-thirds the number and that these enroll a little more than 
two-thirds of all the pupils in private schools. 
As to higher institutions—i. e., colleges and universities—65 per cent 
of the number reporting to the bureau are coeducational. Every year 
sees some addition to the number so classified. The latest reporting 
the admission of women to their privileges are Furman University, 
Greenville, 8. C., which adopted the policy in 1893, and Beloit College, 
Beloit, Wis., 1895. 
Great Britain.—Coeducation is practiced in a large proportion of the 
elementary schools of England and Wales and Scotland, but the sta- 
tistics do not enable us to determine the proportion of pupils in mixed 
schools. In the schools and classes for infants—i. e., children under 7 
  
1In the report for 1891-92, p. 788, it is stated that in the city of Denver, school 
district No. 1, boys and girls are educated in separate classes. This is an error aris- 
ing from a mistake in the reply to the inquiry sent out from the office. Coeducation 
is the practice in all the Denver schools. 
2Erskine College, Due West, S.C., announces that the trustees have authorized 
the admission of women, if they apply for the privilege.

years of age—there is no distinction of sex. As regards England, it 
appears that out of 22,848 departments for older pupils under separate 
head teachers 65 per cent are coeducational, and of the same for Scot- 
land 97 per cent. The distribution between board and private schools 
was as follows in 1894-95:

Statistics for Ireland show that 51 per cent of the national schools 
have a mixed attendance of boys and girls. 
Secondary schools attended by both sexes generally have separate 
departments for each. Itis noticeable that the royal commission on 
secondary education advocate the extension of the coeducation policy.' 
The university colleges established in England since 1868 are open to 
men and women. By the universities act of 1889 the Scotch universi- 
ties were authorized to open their doors to women. Edinburgh admits 
them to the classes with men. Glasgow has affiliated Queen Margaret 
College for women, and more recently (1895) opened all lectures in the 
faculty of arts towomen. The University College of Dundee, affiliated 
to St. Andrews, is coeducational. 
In the British colonies, with very few exceptions, both mixed and 
separate schools are found. In Ontario all the schools are mixed; in 
Quebec the schools for English children are, as a rule, mixed, but in 
those for the French the sexes are separated. In the Australasian colo- 
nies the tendency to separate departments for boys and girls is notice- 
able in cities. In Cape Colony, while nearly all schools are mixed, 
separate schools for girls are encouraged. 
France.—There is a slow but apparently steady increase in the number 
of mixed schools in France—that is, schools in which boys and girls are 
educated together. More significant still is the fact that this increase 
is taking place among private as well as among public schools. In the 
case of the public schools, the increase is confined to the secular schools, 
1See p. 593.
-P-A-G-E-1175
COEDUCATION. 1117 
but this is not the case with private schools. In the class of private 
secular schools, mixed schools have increased by 10.5 per cent, and in 
the class of parochial private schools, by 7.5 per cent since 1886-87. 
While the actual number of pupils in the mixed or coeducational public 
schools diminished in the decade 1886-87 to 1891-92, the relative pro- 
portion of the enrollment increased slightly—i. e., from 16.5 to 16.6 per 
cent. The enrollment in private coeducational schools has increased 
absolutely, but the ratio of enrollment in mixed private schools to the 
total private-school enrollment has declined slightly, i. e., by 0.4 per 
cent. 
Custom and sentiment in France favor the separate education of 
boys and girls, and the law (1836, 1850, 1865, 1886) obliges every com- 
mune to maintain a separate school for girls unless authorized by the 
departmental council to substitute therefor a mixed school. 
The number of communes having no special school for girls, either 
public or private, was a slightly smaller proportion of the total number 
of communes in 1891-92 than in 1886-87, the ratios being, respectively, 
3.4 per cent and 3.7 per cent. Hence it would appear that the number 
of communes seeking to be relieved from the burden of a special school 
for girls does not increase, and that the increased enrollment in mixed 
schools is due to the rise of new communes having less than 500 inhabit- 
ants or to the growth of schools in which coeducation is a fixed policy. 
It is noticeable also that mixed schools are found chiefly in rural dis- 
tricts. Cities, as a rule, maintain separate schools for boys and girls; 
the entire department of the Seine, which is occupied by Paris and its 
environs, reported in 1891-92 for public schools only 0.2 per cent of the 
pupils enrolled in mixed schools, and for private schools 9.2 per cent. 
In the department of secondary education, public and private estab- 
lishments, separate education is the universal rule. As regards the 
universities, however, France has adopted a very liberal policy. The 
law has never prohibited the admission of women to the French facul- 
ties (universities), and since 1863 they have been practically open to 
women. 
The numberof women entering as matriculated students is neces- 
sarily small, since, apart from the absence of powerful incentives to 
severe effort, such as social honors, the certainty of lucrative careers, 
ete., it is difficult for women to secure the required preparation and its 
final sanction, the bachelor’s degree or equivalent; nevertheless, a 
goodly number of women have successfully completed courses in the 
faculties of letters, of science, and of medicine, and received the degree 
of licencié, and, in a few instances, that of doctor. = 
Even the law faculty at Paris numbers women among its graduates. 
“From 1875-76 to 1887-88, inclusive, university degrees to the number 
of 262 were granted to women. These included 39 in medicine, 130 in 
the sciences, 89 in classics and belles-lettres, 1 in pharmacy, and 3 in
-P-A-G-E-1176
  1118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
law. Of the whole number, 137 were obtained in Paris and the 
remainder in the provinces; 207 were conferred upon French women.” 
In the eapacity of hearers or unmatriculated students a large num- 
ber of women are found in attendance upon certain faculty courses at 
Paris and other academie centers. 
Germany.—Separate education is the preferred policy in the German 
States, but coeducation is the rule in the primary schools of cities and 
in the country schools.!. In Saxony, only the two lowest classes are 
mixed, so that separation occurs generally at the tenth year of age, 
always by the twelfth. 
Other continental countries—Similar conditions prevail in the remain- 
ing countries of Europe, the tendency toward separation being most 
strongly marked in the Catholic countries. In Italy, the law calls for 
separate schools for boys and girls, and if they attend at the same 
building, it must be in separate departments, each provided with its 
own entrance door. The lowest classes, however, may be, and often 
are, mixed. : 
In Norway, and to a less extent in Denmark, girls are securing 
admission to secondary schools formerly reserved for boys.” 
The South American Republies follow the precedent of the Latin 
States of Europe. Brazil, like Italy, requires separate schools for the 
two sexes. In 1888 the experiment of admitting boys and girls to the 
same class rooms was made in a few schools, but they were seated in

The admission of women to university privileges characterizes the 
recent history of higher education in Europe. The status of women in 
this respect in France and Great Britain has already been noted; addi- 
tional countries in which women are admitted to the same university 
courses as men are Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, 
Norway, Sweden. Except in Switzerland, comparatively few women 
avail themselves of these privileges. Recent movements looking to the 
extension of similar privileges in German universities, also in Austria, 
Hungary, and Greece, are treated in extenso in another chapter of this — 
report.® 
COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
The report of the Commissioner for 1888-89 presented a chapter on 
the compulsory attendance laws in the United States, which was 
brought “as far as practicable” to March, 1891. At that time 27 
States and Territories of the Union had compulsory attendance laws 
in operation. The important changes that have taken place in respect 
to this matter since that report was prepared are a new compulsory 
education law for New York, enacted May 12, 1894, and a compulsory 
law for Pennsylvania, the first in its history, bearing date May 16, 1895.

COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 1119 
Comparison of the new law for New York with the previous law of 
1894 shows the following important changes: 
The age of required instruction, formerly 8 to 14, is extended two 
years (8 to 16). Under the former law the required annual term of 
school attendance was fourteen weeks, eight of which were to be con- 
secutive. Under the present law, every child between 14 and 16 years 
of age, and “in proper physical and mental condition to attend school,” 
and who is “not regularly and lawfully engaged in any useful employ- 
ment or service,” and every such child “between 8 and 12 years of age 
shall attend upon instruction as many days annually, during the period 
between the first days of October and the following June, as the public 
school of the district or city in which such child resides shall be in 
session during the same period.” 
Every such child between 12 and 14 years of age “shall attend upon 
instruction during such period at least eighty secular days of actual 
attendance, which shall be consecutive, except for holidays, vacations, 
and detentions by sickness, which holidays, vacations, and detentions 
shall not be counted as a part of such eighty days, and such child 
shall, in addition to the said eighty days, attend upon instruction 
when not regularly and lawfully engaged in useful employment or 
service.” The penalties for violation of the law are increased. In place 
of a fine of $1 for the first offense and for each succeeding offense, a 
fine of $5 for each week not exceeding a total of thirteen weeks, the 
present law exacts a maximum fine of $5 for the first offense, and for 
each subsequent offense a fine not exceeding $50 or imprisonment not 
exceeding thirty days. The penalty for employing a child in violation 
of the law is the same as under the former law, but the employment of 
“any child between the ages of 8 and 12 years in any business or 
service whatever, during any part of the term during which the public 
schools of the district in which the child resides are in session,” is 
strictly forbidden. Special officers are designated for the enforcement 
of the law and special schools provided for “the confinement, main- 
tenance, and instruction of truant children.” Moreover, the State 
superintendent may withhold from any city or district which, in his 
judgment, “ willfully omits and refuses to enforce the provisions of this 
act,” one-half of all public school money. Thus the law starting with 
parental obligations recognizes in the end that the welfare of the child 
is a common responsibility. 
The indifference in the matter or absolute opposition to compulsory 
legislation which formerly prevailed among us is evidently passing 
away. On this point the Commissioner’s report already quoted says: 
Tho principle of compulsory education is steadily gaining ground. Steps in 
advance are being taken here and there all along the line. Since 1886 no less than 
16 (now 17) States and Territories have cither enacted laws for the first time or 
have made their former laws more stringent. The arguments and discussions of 
thirty years or more have been gradually silencing opposition, and public sentiment 
is slowly crystallizing in the direction of requiring by law all parents to provide a 
certain minimum of school instruction for their children. This tendency is unmis- 
takable.
-P-A-G-E-1178
  1120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
The most convincing proof of the correctness of this opinion is found 
in the recent legislation in Pennsylvania. The law of May 16, 1895, 
requires that— 
Every parent, guardian, or other person in this Commonwealth having control or 
charge of a child or children between the ages of 8 and 13 years shall send such child 
or children to a school in which the common English branches are taught, and that 
such child or children shall attend such school during at least sixteen weeks of each 
year in which schools in their respective districts shall be in session, unless excused 
from such attendance by the board of the school district in which the parent, guard- 
ian, or other person resides, upon the presentation to said board of satisfactory evi- 
dence showing such child or children are prevented from attendance at school, or 
application to stndy, by mental or physical or other urgent reasons: Provided, That 
in case there be no public school in session within two miles of the nearest traveled 
road of any person within the school district, he or she shall not be liable to the 
provisions of this act: Provided, That this act shall not apply to any child that has 
been or is being otherwise instructed in the common English branches of learning 
for a like period of time: And provided further, That the certificate of any principal 
of any school or educational institution, or of any teacher, that any child has been 
or is being so instructed, issued to such child or its parents or guardians shall be 
sufficient and satisfactory evidence thereof. 
For every neglect of duty imposed by the foregoing section of this 
act, “the person in parental relation offending shall be guilty of a mis- 
demeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof before a justice of the 
peace or alderman, forfeit a fine not exceeding $2 on the first convic- 
tion, and a fine not exceeding $5 for each subsequent conviction.” 
The defendant has, however, privilege of appeal to the courts. The 
act authorizes boards of school directors or school controllers in cities, 
boroughs, or townships to employ attendance officers, “whose duty it 
shall be to look after, apprehend, and place in such schools as the per- 
son in parental relation may designate, truants and others who fail to 
attend school in accordance with the provisions of this act.” 
Provision is made for an annual census of the children of school age 
(8 to 13 years), and teachers are required to— 
report immediately to the secretary of the board of directors or controllers, and 
thereafter, at the close of cach school month, the names of all children on the list 
previously furnished by the secretary, who were absent without satisfactory cause 
for five days during the month for which the report shall be made, when, if it shall 
appear that any parent, guardian, or other person having control of any child or 
children shall have failed to comply with the provisions of this act, after due notifi- 
cation in writing, as provided in section 2, the secretary, or attendance officer, if 
there be one, in the name of the school district, shall proceed against the offending 
party or parties in accordance with law by complaint before any alderman or justice 
of the peace. 
Moreover, the secretary, or attendance officer, if there be one, of 
any board of directors or controllers, who fails to comply with the pro- 
- visions of the act, is to be judged “guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon 
conviction thereof before an alderman or justice of the peace shall for- 
feit a fine not exceeding $25.” 
In his report for 1895, the State superintendent, Hon. Nathan C. 
Schaeffer, says, with reference to this measure: 
But the most far-reaching of all the recent laws is the act making education com- 
pulsory. Under this act children between the ages of 8 and 13 are required to attend

AMERICAN STUDENTS IN FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES. 
Americans intending to pursue a course of higher education in Europe 
chiefly attend German and Swiss universities. Comparatively few 
attend French and English institutions of learning, but for art studies 
they naturally prefer the French schools to the German, while for 
technical branches the German and English schools are preferred. 
Admission to German universities being dependent upon a course of 
preparation in a German classical secondary school (so-called gymnasia), 
Americans are rarely matriculated as regular students, but as hearers 
who have all the privileges of regular students, except that they are 
barred from state examinations which open the way to the learned pro- 
fessions in Germany. The French authorities propose to draw the cur- 
rent of American students to France.’ In Paris a committee of the 
Sorbonne are active in calling the attention of Americans to the advan- 
tages offered in France. They particularly dwell on the fact that 
admission to schools of learning in France for foreigners is facilitated. 
Lately a committee has been organized in Washington working to the 
same end. However, several journals in the United States advocate 
the continuance of the practice in vogue, urging that the German 
language is acquired more easily, hence that an American can more 
easily familiarize himself with the working of a German university, 
and, furthermore, that the German university is a complete institution, 
while a French provincial university is rarely composed of more than 
one or two faculties. The following figures may be of interest:

CONTINUATION AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. 
In Germany, it is well understood that an elementary education, such 
as the common school offers, barely suffices to prepare for the duties of 
life the children of the poorer strata of society. The time between the 
fourteenth and, say, eighteenth years of life is a period during which 
the children are apt to forget what they learned in school, not having 
immediate application of their knowledge in daily pursuits. The vari- 
ous state and communal governments of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, 
and some other States in Europe having recognized the necessity of 
bridging over that period, established what is known as “continuation 
1 For detailed account of this movement see pp. 305 et seq.
-P-A-G-E-1182
1124 EDUCATION REPORT, 1894-95. 
of supplementary schools.” These schools are either day, evening, 
or Sunday schools. In most cases they offer reviews of elementary 
branches, and in addition to these a number of generally useful 
branches of practical knowledge, such as drawing and manual labor. 
When they offer this manual instruction, which is also called instruc- 
tion in trades sometimes, these schools are classed among the industrial 
schools. If they have no such addition, and confine themselves to the 
common school branches, they are called continuation schools only. 
In industrial centers, such as Saxony, Thuringia, and Rhenish Prus- 
sia, as well as in large cities with extensive industries, these continua- 
tion schools are most generally industral schools also, and are specially 
designed to give opportunities to apprentices in workshops and fac- 
tories to prepare themselves better for their pursuits than they could 
otherwise, and the parental governments in central Europe are very 
much concerned about apprentices and the thorough preparation of 
skilled labor. They even prescribe for the boys a compulsory attend- 
ance in these evening or Sunday schools. The State law gives com- 
munities the right to insist upon a compulsory attendance where ample 
provision is made, and where the State gives a subsidy for the mainte- 
nance of such schools. It is the rule, generally accepted in all German- 
speaking nations, that the community establishes the school—that is 
to say, furnishes the house and equipments, light and fuel, as well as 
furniture and tools, and the State pays the salary of the teacher. Thus 
communities and government join hands in maintaining a vast system 
of supplementary schools chiefly designed to prevent the deterioration 
of the elementary common school work, and secondly to facilitate and 
aid industries in the city and in the country, for these schools are not 
industrial schools only but also agricultural, many of them being situ- 
ated in agricultural districts. 
Now, it must not be understood that any of the supplementary or 
continuation schools and industrial and agricultural schools, as they 
are called, are anything more than elementary. The real and actual 
trade schools are of a higher order. These latter schools presuppose 
a thorough common school education, and build upon that by introdue- 
ing higher arithmetic, business methods, a great deal of industrial 
drawing, and the elements of certain trades. These trades are not 
chosen by the State authority, but they are invariably the choice of 
authorities of the community or of certain societies, the aim of which 
is to encourage trade and industry. Many of such schools are there- 
fore established by trades union. Afterwards they were adopted, as it 
were, by the city or communal government, and as such came under 
the State law which provides for the State aid or subsidies. 
Though these schools are primarily established and maintained for 
boys, it must be stated that during the last twenty years the fact that 
women are employed in various industries in factory and shop work 
makes it necessary to extend the benefits of continuation and indus-
-P-A-G-E-1183
SCHOOLS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 1125 
trial schools to girls also. But the Germans recognize the fact that 
woman’s skill lies in different directions from that of man’s skill, and 
they therefore aim to meet the several necessities of woman’s skill in 
school work by carefully discriminating between shopwork for boys 
and for girls. In the models used in drawing, for instance, it is plainly 
seen that a thoughtful discrimination is made. The same is done with 
reference to the work in arithmetic and in commercial branches. 
In some portions of the Empire the continuation schools are very old, 
having begun shortly after the general revival following in the wake 
of the dethronement of Napoleon I. In other parts of the Empire, as 
well as in Austria and Switzerland, and notably in the agricultural 
districts, the continuation schools are of more recent origin. Their 
attendance is not at all uniformly regular, owing to the fact that 
attendance is not everywhere compulsory, and owing also to the fact 
that the skill and popularity of the teacher has much to do with the 
attendance at a school for boys and girls in the critical age between 14 
and 18. It is well understood that this period is a time of storm and 
stress, and subjugation under strict rules and discipline in that age is 
more difficult with children of the lower strata of society than it is 
found in higher schools and colleges, where a higher culture and a more 
refined atmosphere aids the discipline and the general habitus of 
the students. In paragraph 3 of chapter on “ Education in Central 
Europe,” in this annual report, an extensive article on the subject of 
supplementary schools is found. It contains some statisties which 
show the extent of the system.

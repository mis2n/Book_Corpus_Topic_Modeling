    CLASSROOM PRACTICE IN DESIGN 
James PARTON HANEY. 
NY discussion of classroom practice in applied design naturally 
A divides itself into a consideration of the problems to be solved 
and the methods to be employed in solving them. ‘The sequence 
of problems constitutes what is familiarly known as the course of study, 
and to the principles which underlie such a ‘course’ attention must first 
be directed. These principles may be stated as follows: (1) The 
designs made must be for use. (2) The forms decorated must admit 
decoration. (3) The designs must be based on structure. (4) Their 
treatment must be conditioned by material. (5) They must permit 
individual interpretation. (6) Each problem in the sequence should 
develop through a similar series of steps with increasing complexity in 
the relations of the elements employed. 
THE DESIGN MUST BE FOR USE 
All designs made should be for is principle is the first and 
most important consideration in the teaching of applied design to young 
students. When design is taught as a series of abstract patterns, or 
when problems are developed which are not applied, but remain “paper” 
patterns, the work is taken out of the realm of the real and becomes a 
mere school exercise. In this guise it is robbed of half its interest, and 
more than half its value. Until the pupil is brought into contact with 
the form to be decorated the real problem of design is not presented. 
Teachers whose habit it is to teach design through formal exer- 
cises are frequently astonished and discouraged to see their pupils who 
have been schooled in abstract principles, work out for their own delec- 
tation wierd naturalistic decorations for pillows, tidies, book-covers 
and box-tops, in fancy stitch or pyrographic line. Dismay is felt that 
previous teachings have made so little impression, but the truth is they 
have not been teachings. ‘The school work has not been real work. 
The design taught has not been seen by the pupil as a real design, but 
only as school design to be done and laid aside without a thought, when 
one comes to decorate something one really wishes to be “fine” or 
“pretty.” Z

  The moral of this is evident. Design is an agent chiefly of value 
for the teaching of taste, and taste is not to be taught as an abstraction. 
It must be developed as a power to discriminate between things good and 
bad, as they surround us in our daily life. The lessons through which 
it is taught must be lessons dealing with concrete models, and the 
decorations made, must be seen as essential to the success of the forms 
decorated. 
Some teachers object to this approach because they feel that so few 
designs may be made for actual application that their work, if limited to 
these, would be hampered and restricted. Such would prefer to have 
the whole field of the Arts—cabinet-making, iron-smithing, textile weav- 
ing, and the like—in which to roam with their tyros. This objection is 
short-sighted. Any careful scrutiny of classroom conveniences, of forms 
made in school workshops, or commonly devised for gifts at holiday- 
time, will soon convince one that in these objects there is opportunity to 
teach the principles of design, in problems much more significant to the 
child than cabinets, gates, weaves, and wall papers, never to be developed 
further than the paper on which they are drawn. 
To make the teaching of design live teaching, it must rise from life. 
The course of study should condition the difficulty of each pattern, but 
necessity should determine the thing for which the pattern is made. 
That thing when furnished should play a real part in the life of the 
maker. School designs, like designs made out of school, should rise 
from necessity, and disappear—worn out—in use. The teacher who fails 
to see this must always fail to secure vitality in his work. Though 
the finding of suitable problems may at times offer some difficulty, it is 
his very business to discover them, and to lead to them by natural paths. 
‘The most satisfactory conditions are present when the work in con- 
struction and design can proceed hand in hand, the earlier exercises in 
‘making’ taking the form of useful models in paper, cardboard, textiles. 
leather, or thin metal, and the later in wood, in clay or in forms of book- 
binding. But many schools have no course in constructive work. Under 
such circumstances it will be necessary to develop forms to be decorated 
out of paper or cardboard. A number may be so made, as the program 
cover, honor roll, menu, book-plate, class motto, book-cover, book-mark, 
portfolio, poster, invitation card, decorative shield for the school festival, 
etc. Other objects, as doilies, mats, curtains, table covers, etc., may be 
very simply made of linen, canvas, denim or other textile. More ad- 
vanced types of models suitable for decoration are shown in Fig. 1.

  Simple shop work models suitable for decoration are shown in Fig. 2. 
Attention is called to the very simple forms of the designs applied to 
them. 
FORMS DECORATED MUST ADMIT DECORATION 
Not all constructed forms may be decorated with propriety. In gen- 
eral it may be said that only those may be so treated which themselves 
serve a decorative purpose. ‘The use to which the model is to be put 
controls in large measure its decoration, for all decoration must be subor- 
dinate to utility. 
Decoration is for interest’s sake, but when added, it should serve to 
increase interest legitimately, without making an exaggerated plea for 
attention. The enrichment should seek to catch and charm the eye by 
play of light and shade of color, by harmonious masses and quaint con- 
ceits of pattern. The form decorated must not war with its suroundings. 
The paper-knife which is to lie upon the drawing room table may have 
its handle carved or inlaid, while the handle of the kitchen knife should 
be devoid of ornament, that it might be readily cleansed. The kitchen 
box to hold salt or spices should be of the plainest description, while 
the library rack to hold paper may, in keeping with its surroundings, be 
soberly enriched. 
Included in the list of forms which may be properly decorated under 
the conditions stated above, are various shapes and sizes of posters, 
mottoes, cards, covers, doilies, bags, pillows, books, portfolios, cases, 
boxes, racks, brackets, frames, trays, stands, etc. Some of these forms 
may be made of cardboard, some of textile, some of wood or metal. The 
box is a type. It may be made of heavy paper, or of cardboard covered 
with textile, or of wood or metal. Its design may be a simple decoration 
of lines or straps, or an elaborate pattern in repousse or carving. As it 
may thus be made to serve in various situations as a basis for applied 
design, so many of the other forms suggested may be adapted to the 
needs of different classes. 
WHEN NOT TO DECORATE 
In general it may be said that the lowly form, or one subjected to 
constant use, to wear and soil, should not be decorated. The following, 
sometimes selected by class teachers, are therefore better undecorated: 
Foot-stool, knife-box, flower-stick, string-winder, key-tag, etc. The 
question as to the part it is to play—its use or function—is the one 
determining whether a form is to be decorated or not. The object whose

function it is to be interesting and attractive may have such interest 
enhanced by applied pattern; that which plays the part of a drudge, one 
soiled by constant handling, should, indeed, be good in its propor- 
tions, but unadorned by fret or arabesque. 
THE EXTENT OF DECORATION 
Over decoration is more to be feared than under decoration. There 
should be a reserve in every applied design. It should not make an in- 
sistent call for attention by huge growths, eye-wearying interlaces, or a 
twinkling chequer of lights and darks, There is a beauty in quiet spaces. 
The effort should be to secure the minimum of pattern which will suffice 
to make the form interesting and save it from the charge of being 
“empty.” 
There need be little fear of making a design “too simple;” the less 
involved it is, the more the fine relations of lines and spaces stand out. 
That pattern which consists merely of a strap or two emphazing the 
outline of a square, and blossoming here and there into a flower or fret, 
will tax the skill of the best pupils. ‘The use of the “strap” as a 
decorative element, is, by the way, much to be commended. It serves 
to accent edges and develops equally well into formal fret or convention- 
alized leaf or flower. Patterns so devised may be incised, carved, stained, 
or treated with any special tool. They are useful on wood, textile, clay 
or metal, and form one of the most serviceable and appropriate types of 
design which may be developed in the classroom. 
APPLIED DESIGN MUST BE BASED ON STRUCTURE 
The structural elements of the form decorated should always appear 
as the basis of the decoration. The design should be seen to rise out of 
the structure, the model appearing to demand the decoration, rather 
than to exist merely for the sake of being decorated. The decoration 
should serve to give structural emphasis to the form; boundary lines 
should be strengthened by it, and corners supported. Each model should 
be carefully considered from the standpoint of structure, and joints, 
edges, feet, locks, hinges—all those things which particularly charac- 
terize it—should be examined to see which offer the greatest advantages 
as points of force, “‘start” or “growth” points, from which the pattern 
may spring. 
It must be the effort to make the decoration appear as an intrinsic 
part of the model. The form itself must condition the design and such 
10
-P-A-G-E-9
  
design must not take precedence over the function of the object. The 
latter must still declare itself, rack, mat, or box-top. The design must 
support and strengthen the idea of function while it serves to create 
a greater ‘interest in the surface on which it is placed. 
The illustrations of this law.are vatious. The plan of a design for 
a book-cover may, for instance, be gotten from the stitches which hold 
the leaves together (Fig. 8), that for a box from the edges, feet and lock 
escutcheon of the model (Fig. 9). Racks which stand, may properly 
have the design rise from the points on which the pressure comes, while 
forms which are to hang should have their pendant quality made plain. 
  
  
  Others which are to enclose a space, as dishes, trays, etc., may have this 
holding quality indicated, the pattern aiding, as the sides of the form it- 
self, to contain the things within. The portfolio held together by metai- 
lic fasteners may have the design spring from such points, while the closet 
door hung on hinges may have the latter extend into ornamental bands 
that divide the door into interesting spaces and call attention to the 
points which support the form itself. (See Fig. 4, 5, 6.) 
No part of the development of applied design calls for more attention 
than the question of structure. To be in a position to guide pupils 
aright, the teacher must learn to see all forms in terms of structure, and 
must call upon his class to interpret and reinterpret models in great 
variety, in such terms. Applied design must, in its teaching, be based 
upon a power of analysis, a power of dissecting constructive elements 
and of supporting them with motifs, which display the structural ex- 
cellence of the model they seek to decorate. 
It is to be remembered, however, that no one pattern exhausts the 
decorative possibilities of any given form. Constructed forms possess 
11
-P-A-G-E-10
  divers structural elements, some of which may be emphasized by one 
pattern, some by another. A book-cover may thus have its back or bind- 
ing quality developed in one design, (Fig. 8), its edges and corners 
strengthened in another, or the oblong nature of the surface treated in a 
variety of ways in others still. (Fig. 3). Yet all of these designs may 
be in perfect structural propriety.

That pupils may be led to appreciate te truth of the foregoing state- 
ment, it is well, in practice, to consider various possible methods of dec- 
orating any given form, basing each design upon a different characteristic 
of its function and structure. It will also be of advantage to require the 
young designers now and again, to plan or sketch without assistance a 
variety of suitable patterns for some form they have not previously con- 
sidered. Their designs they should then be required to explain and de- 
fend agreeable to the law of structure. The habit of self-criticism thus 
developed forms one of the best methods of learning what makes for 
sound practice,
-P-A-G-E-11
  
N APPLIED DESIGNS MUST BE CONDITIONED BY MATERIAL 
Where the models decorated differ in the material of which they are 
constructed, the applied patterns must also differ in their treatment. 
The finer and smoother the texture of the material, the more delicate 
must be the elements of the design. A coarse surface, as canvas or bur- 
\ POUNT FOR: 
BONO ROLL 
  FIG. 5. 
lap, necessitates, a broad and simple treatment, while the denser and 
more resistant surface of metal or of leather, must have its design plan- 
ned with consideration for the light and shade produced by the tooling. 
Natural beauty of texture must not be destroyed by the decoration. 
Applied stains should thus serve in the case of wooden models to bring 
out the grain and not to conceal it. Large designs and those which are 
to carry some distance, as borders for table cloths, piano covers, curtains, 
etc., will as a rule require simple, yet forceful treatment with masses of 
good size, and strong connecting lines. (See Fig. 22.). 
So far as possible, a course in applied design should include work in 
more than one material. No one can truly be said to have a knowledge 
of the subject until he has come into contact with a variety of textures, 
and has learned the limitations which texture enjoins upon pattern. No 
13. 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
design can be transferred unchanged from one material to another; each 
ae must see a re-adaption made necessary by the new material. 
\ 
PROBLEMS MUST PERMIT INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATION 
This principle, it would seem, might almost go without saying, yet a 
word relative to it may not be amiss. It is in the possibility of making

each pattern the designer’s own that one of the chief advantages of the 
subject appears. It is through failure properly to govern this personal 
element that one of the chief difficulties in teaching is experienced. 
All problems offered should aim to present the elements to be modi- 
fied in very conservative and carefully considered fashion. In the 
earliest exercises, the personal equation should play a restricted part. 
Only one or two lines or spaces should offer for modification and the 
solution of the problem should turn upon the treatment of such line or 
space. As the pupil progresses, he is to be allowed more and more lati- 
tude until he finally determines the size, shape and arrangement of spaces 
and their development into conventionalized forms of more or less com- 
plexity.

It is well to remember when a class ‘‘goes to pieces” in its efforts to 
devise original designs that the chances are all in favor of the real short- 
coming being chargeable, not to the pupils but to the teacher, who did 
not sufficiently guard the problem in its statement, but permitted so many 
opportunities for individual treatment that a multiplied series of errors 
became possible. ‘The problem which proves too difficult is one in 
which there are more elements than the teacher can properly consider 
and review in the work presented for criticism. A limited field for the 
beginner does much to insure successful class-work. Illustration of the 
increasing part which the pupil may be permitted to play appears in the 
outline which follows. 
\ N EACH PROBLEM SHOULD DEVELOP THROUGH A SIMILAR 
SEQUENCE OF STEPS 
No very sharp lines serve to distinguish any one series of problems 
from those which follow. In the general sequence offered, it has been 
the effort to illustrate several groups of problems, in which the same 
principles are presented in designs applied to a variety of forms. The 
problems within each group are about of equal difficulty. In developing 
a course of study, three or four examples from each group should be 
offered to the pupils before those of the succeeding group are attempted. 
Especial attention is called to the fact that the world of applied 
design teems with examples of arrangements of masses perfectly suited 
to the purpose of the elementary teacher, if the latter but offer them in 
simple form, without the involved conventionalized matter of the orig- 
inals. One on the outlook for good mass arrangements will find scores 
to supplement those shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7, many requiring little 
change to adapt them admirably to classroom use. 
Group I. These problems (Fig. 4) offer (1) a given space (2) to 
be decorated by a given unit or series of units (3) arranged in a given 
manner and (4) requiring only modification of the outline of the unit 
or repeat. 
‘The emphasis in these problems is to be placed on the change in the 
single side of the unit, which may be cut from folded paper, unfolded 
and traced as often as may be necessary. Many illustrations of good 
units should be offered to the pupils, each of whom should cut out 
several and choose the best for use. 
Group II. These problems (Fig. 5) offer (1) a given space (2) 
to be decorated in a given manner, (3) requiring in the simpler problems 
16
-P-A-G-E-15
that the mass be broken up without modification of outline, and in the 
more advanced, that the mass be individually modified as to size and 
placing, and as to width of connecting band, if such is to be used. 
The emphasis in these problems should fall on the development of 
simplicity and strength in the lines which break up the mass. The prin- 
ciple of growth should be shown to underlie the good divisions of masses 
and solutions showing twisted and uncertain dividing lines, and num- 
erous and badly related elements should be deprecated. 
  Group III. These problems (Fig. 6) offer (1) a space whose pro- 
portions are to be determined by the pupil, (2) the space to be decorated 
by masses individual as to size, outline and placing, (3) and broken up 
or developed in minor elements individually treated. 
The effort in these problems should be to secure simplicity and dig- 
nity of treatment. In the case of each, the pupil’s attention should be 
directed to the various masses which contribute to the design, and in 
criticism of his own design he should be called upon to reveiw the rela- 
tions of such masses to one another, in the terms of balance, rhythm, 
variety and unity. His attention must also be strongly drawn to the 
principles of structure. Hitherto the structural success of his designs 
has rested upon the teacher, who offered the masses ready for modifica- 
tion; now the pupil must seek to secure such structural quality for 
himself. 
17
-P-A-G-E-16
  Group IV. These problems (Fig. 7) offer space similar to those 
in Group III, to be decorated by masses planned in individual fashion 
and developed into simple conventionalized forms. 
Relations and structure are to be emphasized and efforts made to 
secure subject matter, individual in treatment and marked by subtle ” 
rhythms and fine proportions. The conventional elements will, for the 
most part, have to be developed from charts of natural forms, and some 
practice in adapting the natural forms to different spaces will be required, 
before the masses can be filled with success. In connection with these 
problems the laws of growth must be developed, and consideration given 
  FIG. 9. 
to the forms of conventional treatment suitable to the different materials 
(wood, textile, leather, metal) which present themselves for decoration. 
‘The range of school work is completed in this group. Pupils who 
can successfully solve the more advanced exercises are possessed of 
principles having a wide range of application. ‘They should to a reason- 
able degree, be prepared to analyze and state the excellencies and defects 
of any pattern placed before them. This power is well worth striving 
for, be the possessor’s future station and occupation what it may. 
METHODS IN CLASSROOM PRACTICE 
Essential to the successful development of any given problem in the 
classroom is: (1) Adequate preparation by the teacher. (2) Appro- 
priate illustrative material. (3) An analysis of the problem by the pupil, 
followed by its definite statement by the teacher. (4) Systematic de- 
velopment of the steps of the problem. (5) Critical review by the 
pupils. 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
    
       
-P-A-G-E-18
  ADEQUATE PREPARATION BY THE TEACHER 
Adequate preparation by the teacher requires that he consider in 
detail the elements of the problem to be solved by his pupils. Upon him 
rests the determination of the propriety of the design in question. He 
must satisfy himself that the model to be decorated will have its beauty 
enhanced by the proposed decoration, and must settle upon the exact type 
of pattern which the pupil is to develop. If more than one scheme of 
1s MI

FIG, 11, CONVENTIONAL ne FROM FLOWERS AND SEED-PODS 
decoration presents itself, it may be possible for him to have part of his 
class solve the problem in one way, while another part develops a differ- 
ent arrangement. As a rule it will not be wise to attempt more than two 
such variations. 
Emphasis is to be laid upon the preliminary determination of the 
problem by the teacher. It is he who is responsible for the main ele- 
ments of the pattern. It is his business to lead his pupils to make de- 
signs which are good in arrangement, and original only so far as his 
pupils are prepared to do original work. He should solve the problem 
20  
-P-A-G-E-19
  himself, that he may learn the most satisfactory arrangement of masses 
and the manner in which they may be best developed. So doing he 
will have revealed to him, the difficulties his class will experience—diffi- 
culties which lie in those steps that call for original work. In the 
simplest problems such difficulties are found in the modification of the 
masses, in the more difficult, they involve questions as to the size and 
placing of the masses, their development and conventional treatment. 
Through his own solution the teacher is prepared to prevent egregious 
errors of performance by his pupils,

ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PROBLEM 
What is termed originality in design is largely a matter of recombina- 
tion. The professional designer has a broad background of experience 
and has recourse to examples from the hands of other artists. The child 
has a limited experience made up chiefly of recollections of bad examples 
which he has seen at home or in the shops. It is essential, therefore, 
that many well-chosen illustrations be placed before him, when he is 
called upon to work for himself. 
21
-P-A-G-E-20
Good illustrations are.essential to good design. ‘They not only offer 
technical suggestions but they establish standards of performance by 
which the child can judge his work. Without suitable illustrations he 
solves his problem in the dark. By means of them he can be shown ex- 
actly what is wanted. 
The illustrative matter offered should take three forms—charts, 
blackboard drawings, and examples of pupils’ work. In the lower 
grades, the charts (made on good sized sheets of wrapping paper) should 
show various simple arrangements of masses, simply divided. “They may 
be painted with ink or water-color, or drawn with colored chalks. In 
the upper grades, a variety of these illustrative sheets will prove of value. 
Some should offer drawings of plant forms and illustrations of growth 
and the details of flowers and leaves (sce Fig. 10.) ; others should show 
conventional elements derived from such plants. (See Fig. 11.) Small 
hectographed reproductions of flower parts, mass arrangements, etc., will 
also prove useful. These should be on oak-tag that they may stand the 
wear and tear of constant handling by many pupils. (See Fig. 12.) 
Still other charts, made by mounting illustrations on large sheets of 
cardboard, will be of service. ‘These examples should be taken from the 
work of professional designers in art magazines, catalogues, advertising 
circulars and the like. The pupils themselves should be led to aid in 
making such charts, designs being solicited from them, which offer good 
illustrations of mass arrangements. Not only is the search for these of 
great value in developing the taste, but as they show the practical appli- 
cation of the principles of decoration, they cause the pupils to realize the 
importance of their study. (See Fig. 13.) ; 
Blackboard illustration should be constant during the development 
of any problem. Those drawings to which it is desirable repeatedly to 
refer, should be made with colored chalk on large sheets of wrapping 
paper. The color is attractive, and the drawings, if carefully handled, 
may be saved from lesson to lesson. ‘This, when a single problem in de- 
sign carries over several lessons is of no small advantage. 
Perhaps the most serviceable of all aids are good examples of pupils’ 
work. These should be collected from term to term until the teacher has 
two or three score of them. They may readily be pinned up during the 
development of any lesson, and removed when actual work begins, that 
mere copying may be prevented. Later they may again be displayed, 
that the work of the class as a whole may be compared with the best re- 
sults previously secured. (See Figs. 14 and 22.)

ANALYSIS AND STATEMENT OF PROBLEM 
Before the pupils take the first step in the development of any desigin, 
it should be studied in a general way. ‘The pupils should be interested 
in the problem as a problem, led to see the propriety of the proposed 
decoration, and the nature of its service as an aid to the structure and 
beauty of the form decorated. The steps involved should be next con- 
sidered in the order followed by the teacher in his own study. 
23
-P-A-G-E-22
The class should first be led to discover the mass or masses which 
will best serve the desired purpose, these being considered in the light 
of structure, balance, rhythm, variety, unity. ‘The masses decided upon, 
the pupils should next consider how they may best be broken up, and 
if conventional matter is to be used, the particular plant or flower which 
is best suited to the pattern. In the light of such study they should be 
prepared to understand exactly what the lesson includes, and to solve the 
problem when stated to them in definite and specific form, as—‘‘Make a 
design for a book-cover measuring 5 x 9 inches, the design to consist of 
the word ‘Notes,’ and a square decorative unit beneath the title, etc.” 
Much advantage lies in this specific statement. By it the problem 
is taken out of the realm of the abstract and made concrete, in terms 
with which the pupil is familiar. The professional designer always has 
a distinct problem before him; the beginner should see his own work 
as definite. The latter should never be directed to “make a design” with- 
out being completely informed as to the nature and purpose of the pat- 
tern. ‘Through such statement he learns that every problem can be 
reduced to simple and definite form, and learns, too, that the questions 
he has to solve are identical in kind with those of the practiced designer. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
It was pointed out that, in his analysis of the problem, the pupil is 
to be led to discover certain steps as essential to the solution. These 
should be taken up seriatim. 
1. The planning of the masses. The main masses should be de- 
cided on with careful attention to the structural qualities of the space 
decorated, the elements planned being seen to confirm structural rela- 
tions.. Simplicity is a virtue to be constantly referred to. If the design 
is at all a complex one, careful consideration should be given to the 
various spaces created in the background of the pattern. The back- 
ground it is to be remembered always forms a part of the design, and 
should receive as much attention as the decorative elements placed up- 
on it. F 
To assist the pupil to realize how far small changes in the mass ar- 
rangement effect the design, it will at times be found convenient to cut 
out of paper, two or three of the chief elements of the pattern. These 
may be placed on the space to be decorated and moved about until sat- 
isfactory relations of background and pattern are established. If the 
masses thus planned are not right in size or shape, others may be made. 
When the best arrangement has been decided upon, a pencil may be run

  around the edges of the paper templates, and the pupil led to consider 
the next step in his work. 
Some cautions are to be noted in regard to the planning of the pat- 
tern. As a general rule the design should not crowd the edge of the 
space decorated. If there is a panel within, such as occurs in box-top 
or similar designs, greater color unity will result if the tone of the panei 
is repeated in a narrow mass surrounding the entire design. (See Fig. 
15.) A similar margin will lend to the effectiveness of nearly all pat- 
terns; its value lies chiefly in the fact that it emphasizes the outline and 
so lends to the structure of the space decorated.

It is surprising to what extent strength of structure may be alterea 
by lines which are allowed to impinge on the border of an enclosing 
space. Fig. 16 shows a rectangle which has its squareness entirely de- 
stroyed (in a) by a curve which draws in the sides, and (in b) by radial 
lines which contract the corners. The dotted lines show the direction in 
which the sides appear distorted. The third figure (c) has had the 
squareness of the form strengthened by the small masses which support 
the corners. The angles of this and similar forms, are structurally their 
most important elements. 
In general the development of very large masses is to be deprecated, 
as is the development of large elements connected by very slender straps, 
or large straps connecting masses which are insignificant. Also to be 
avoided is the creation of strap or leaf-like forms which do not follow 
and support the lines of the main space, but introduce a number of 
curved lines, which draw the eye out of the enclosing boundary. Such 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  
elenients, common enough in pupils’ designs, destroy the strength of the 
enclosing line and weaken the entire pattern. (See Fig. 17a.) 
Of the various devices for expediting class work, two or three may 
be mentioned. The first looks to the development of the symmetrical 
halves of a pattern having masses with subtlely drawn curves. Such 
symmetry may be secured by folding the paper on which the trial draw- 
ing is to be made, and indicating the general outline on either side of 
the fold. After the main masses have been planned and very carefully 
drawn on one half of the pattern, the latter may be folded on the mid- 
foo”

crease, and a reproduction of the mass arrangement made by rubbing. 
The design for a square or oblong may similiarly be made by creasing 
the paper at right angles and developing one quarter of the pattern, 
which may be transferred by rubbing to the other corners. (See Fig. 23.) 
Decorated units, especially the simple forms. of the lower grades, 
may also be made by folding and cutting. The tablets thus devised wil! 
serve as templates and may be traced as frequently as desired. 
2 ie development of the masses. In the development of the 
masses the téacher should have.constant recourse to the blackboard, the 
pupils also being called upon to illustrate their understanding of the 
problem by sketches made before their fellows. 
Particularly should the advantage of a growth point be emphasized 
in the development of each mass. Radial growth it will be well to have 
developed from a definite mass and not from a mere point. ‘The latter 
lacks the strength of the former. (See Fig. 18.) The necessity of 
having but two or three leading lines, and of securing rhythm, variety 
and unity in the forms created must be strongly brought to the attention 
of the pupils.* 
The chief cautions to be observed are, the avoidance of contrary 
motion in the patterns, the avoidance of small elements and of explosive

movements caused by too many radial lines. Also to be deprecated 
are the weak and uncertain lines, adversely criticized in a foregoing para- 
graph. The pupils must learn that every line in a design should have a 
definite function and definite movement, and that no “‘feebly flapping” 
element, born of a line which does not know where it is going, is to be

tolerated. When the young designers come to separate the minor 
elements, one from another, they are also to be cautioned not to open 
wide spaces between them. Should they do so the strength of the 
original masses will be destroyed. (See Fig. 17e.) 
28 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
At this stage of the pattern it will be well for the pupils critically to 
review their work. The best of the examples should be shown and 
commended for excellencies of structure, growth, rhythm, consistency 
of elements, etc.; the poorer should also be examined that the cause of 
their failure may be determined. After such review, the pupils should 
be required to refine their patterns, making commonplace curves more 
subtle, perfecting rhythms and strengthening weak points in structure.

3. Introduction of subject matter. Anything like a thorough study 
of conventionalization cannot be taken up in the elementary school nor 
in the high school unless unusual time offers for its teaching. The ele- 
mentary teacher will, therefore, be wise if he attempts to secure little 
beyond the individual adaption of conventional elements to the masses of 
the pattern already devised. The elements referred to should be offered 
in the form of charts. The source of the various forms should be ex- 
plained, but it is not necessary, nor is it often possible for the pupil to 
develop elements directly from natural forms. If he adapt well the 
forms offered him, there will be abundant cause for congratulation. 
Before the worker is called upon to use such conventional elements, 
it will be well that he have some practice in shaping them to various 
spaces. This practice may be given by having him make a number of 
units with brush strokes, using the motifs offered combined in various 
ways to make flower forms resembling those shown him by the teacher. 
(See Fig. 19.) Some little practice in this way will enable him to make 
a sheet or two of original elements very similar to those shown on the 
charts. He may then proceed with promises of success, to the develop- 
ment of similar forms in the masses of his design. 
29 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
In adapting the subject matter to his pattern the pupil should be re- 
minded to suit the character of the element to the peculiar nature of the 
design in hand. The more rigid and formal the pattern, the more formal 
should be the conventionalized material. This desired formality can be 
secured by the use of right lines and square angles in the place of curves 
and rounded forms. (See Fig. 15)

  FIG. 19. PRACTICE UNITS MADE WITH BRUSH 
The devices used by skilled workers to simplify patterns containing 
subject matter, can only be learned by a study of a large number of pro- 
fessional designs. ‘Two, however, may be mentioned as particularly help- 
ful. The first is the agglutination of details which overlap or impinge 
apon one another. (See Fig. 20.) This produces what is virtually a 
motif in silhouette. The second is the surrounding by a strong outline, 
of those particluar masses which play an important part in the rhythm of 
the pattern. (See Fig. 21.) When circumspectly applied, this outline 
will materially strengthen a confused and unsatisfactory design. 
30
-P-A-G-E-29
SYMBOLISM 
‘The use of motifs particularly related to the form decorated, or to 
the designers themselves, is to be commended. This gives to the subject 
  
  FIG. 20. AGGLUTINATION OF ELEMENTS OF SUBJECT MATTER 
FIG. 21. PATTERN SHOWING USE OF FINE LINES FOR DETAILS AND STRONG 
LINES FOR MASSES 
matter a symbolic significance. Such practice, will for example employ 
Indian motifs in a design for a note-book on Indian life and legends, or 
loaves and fishes for a collection of receipts made in the school kitchen. 
The wide application of symbolism cannot be discussed here, but class 
teachers will find it lends an added interest to all work in which it enters. 
31
-P-A-G-E-30
  it contains the hint of hidden meaning, and the suggestion of the personal 
—very attractive to the youthful worker. Symbolic elements associated 
with the school may be devised and adapted to this end. These may in- 
clude the school flower, the school pin, banner or favorite tree. For the 
most part, the skilled utilization of this material must be left to the older 
pupils. 
TRACING 
When the design has been completed by repeated correction, it will 
have to be traced upon the form to which it is to be applied. Various 
devices offer here. If it has been made with a moderately soft pencil 
and presents sharp clear outlines, a satisfactory rubbing may often be 
made upon paper, wood, or any light colored and smooth surface. If this 
is impossible, the black may be blackened with a soft pencil, and the 
tracing made with a hard sharp-pointed one, or tracing paper may be 
used as purchased, or as manufactured of thin wrapping paper which has 
been given a coat of stove polish. ‘The latter paper is easily prepared, 
costs but a trifle, and forms a satisfactory substitute for the commercial 
article. 
Zz CLASS CRITICISM 
During the development of any pattern the pupils should be re- 
peatedly called upon to criticise their work. So far as possible, this 
should be a class exercise, the examples being placed where all may see 
them. It is important that this critical review be undertaken: first after 
the masses have been developed, and again after the subject matter has 
been introduced. 
The steps of the criticism should be systematic, the pupils being 
called upon to examine the work from the standpoint of structure, bal- 
ance, rhythm, variety and unity. It is not enough for those who criticise 
to say that they do not like this or that element in the design. They 
should state their reasons, and indicate the principles that have been 
violated and the manner in which the correction is to be effected. They 
should, in other words, criticise in terms of design. 
It is impossible to note all the forms of error which may be present 
in the work of a class, but two or three examples may be suggestive as 
to types of mistakes and their correction. 
Fig. 17a shows a decorated unit designed for a book-cover. This is 
poor in structure, its outline weakening the enclosing oblong. It is far 
too large a unit, and the title which it presents appears relatively un- 
important.

      No minor change can make 
this into a satisfactory form. 
Correction may perhaps best 
be effected (see b) by reduc- 
ing the size of the unit, by 
strengthening the boundary 
line (developing it as one 
smooth flowing curve), drop- 
ping the lowermost element 
altogether (fusing it with the 
bounding mass), rhythmically 
relating the space with the 
initials to the nearby elements, 
and simplifying the smaller 
masses shown above. Finally, 
the word “Notes” may be made 
to play a definite and import- 
ant part in the design. “Thus 
while the original idea has 
been retained the design as a 
design is improved. ‘The im- 
provement, however, has neces- 
sitated complete redrawing. 
Fig. 17c shows a design 
which requires less change. 
The mass arrangement is here 
well placed but too large and 
uncertain in its inner line, the 
enclosing panel being poor in 
shape. The latter is also 
weakened by the hanging unit 
above, which is not well re- 
lated to the general mass. 
Correction is to be effected 
(see d) by reducing the size of 
the mass, strengthing the inner 
line into one decided move- 
ment and simplifying the panel 
by the inclusion of the hanging unit in the mass of the pattern.
-P-A-G-E-32
  Fig. 17e shows a pattern in which the mass arrangement has been 
well planned, but one in which the pupil has failed to develop the details 
properly. The minor elements have the appearance of being simply 
drawn over the original mass and not developed by tentative lines of 
division. Rhythm is lacking in the elements, and contrary movements 
appear; there are too many small parts and growth is not well main- 
  FIG. 23. A COMMUNAL EXERCISE—PIANO COVER DE- 
SIGNED BY A GROUP OF 8TH YEAR PUPILS 
tained. The separate elements are also so far apart that they have a 
scattered appearance. Variety has been secured, but improperly secured 
at the expense of unity. 
This design is to be corrected (see f) by uniting the smaller elements 
with the larger, by reducing their number and establishing a definite 
movement of growth from the ends of the lower strap of the pattern. 
The original mass arrangement is left unchanged, but the minor elements 
are welded and have the lines between them refined in curvature. This 
form of error will be apt to appear in any case where a class teacher has 
carefully supervised the planning of the decorative mass, but has not led 
his pupils by definite steps to its development. 
SUMMARY 
In the foregoing discussion two general principles appear as essential 
to the success of the teacher who essays to teach design, the first, that 
he know exactly what he wants to do, the second, that he bring his pupils 
to know what he wishes them to do. The one requires analysis of every 
pattern before it is presented, the other can be insured by developing 
34
-P-A-G-E-33
  
each problem step by step, remembering always the abiding merit of good 
example. So led, the pupil can be made to assume greater responsibility 
in each new lesson. If at any time he fails to do right, it will be, nine 
cases in ten, because he does not know what is right. 
Some may be prepared to cavil at so slow procedure along the path 
which leads to the doing of original work without let or hinderance, but 
the advantage of the method appears when a class so instructed is re- 
quired to devise, unaided, decorations for forms which are new to them. 
It should be the practice to give such “test problems” from time to time, 
to the more advanced pupils. The results secured should be criticized in 
the same manner as the other class-work. Experience has shown that 
when these tests are given to pupils taught as suggested, they reveal a 
power to devise commendable decorations, far in advance of pupils in- 
structed on “free” lines. After all, the proof of every pudding lies in 
its eating.

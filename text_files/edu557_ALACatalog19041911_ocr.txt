PREFACE 
In consulting this list its limitations of date should be kept in mind. With a 
very few exceptions, to be mentioned later, it includes no works earlier than 1904, 
the date of the original Catalog, and less than a half dozen 1912 works, which have 
been added where there existed no book of earlier date that was equally good. 
The general plan of the Catalog and the routine of cooperation in the selection of 
titles practically coincide with those of the original work (see p. 6, 8 of Editorial 
preface to Class list) except that the whole routine, from the preliminary selection 
to the final preparation for printing, has remained in the hands of one person. The 
list of cooperating librarians and experts has been much less extensive, owing to the 
fact that in the A. L. A. Booklist the editor had at hand a body of titles, covering 
nearly the whole period, which had already had the benefit of a certain amount of 
cooperative opinion, 
All titles have been submitted to the publishers for latest information, so that the 
list should be dependable for prices. As a result of this examination by publishers 
a considerable number of useful works have had to be rejected because out of print, 
but, as a whole, the Catalog has suffered less in this respect than the 1904 publica- 
tion did, 
Classification. The sixth edition (1899) of the Decimal Classification has been 
followed. This decision was made on the understanding that the smaller libraries 
had not to any extent adopted the seventh edition. It is to be hoped that when the 
revision of the 1904 Catalog is undertaken there may be at hand a complete revised 
edition of the ‘‘D. C.’’ simplified for the requirements of the smaller libraries. The 
larger libraries which have adopted the new edition need no help in classification. 
Titles have been more minutely classified than the small library practice demands, 
for two reasons: (1) the closer classification makes the list of greater value for 
reference purposes; (2) the majority of libraries using the Catalog subdivide more 
closely than the small library and it is a simpler matter to reduce a number than 
to expand it. 
Subject headings. The addition of subject headings (not given in the Class 
list of the 1904 Catalog) was determined on before the decision to print only a class 
list was made. It has been a freyuent request from’ the librarians of smaller ,li- 
braries, who need help in this matter and who found it difficult to find the headings 
chosen for the Dictionary list in the 1904 Catalog. The new edition of the List of 
subject headings has been followed, with some additions. It is quite possible that 
not as many headings are suggested as many libraries use, an effort having been 
made to follow a medium course between the duplication and very full analysis that 
only the very small library can afford and the briefer entry of the large library, 
with its elaborate cross reference system. Where. the subjects of analytics are 
easily ascertainable, they are only recommended. Neither the classification nor sug- 
(5) 
 
-P-A-G-E-6

gestions for headings should be taken too seriously. There are many books which 
can be classed with perfect consistency in any one of three or four places. The li- 
brarian alone can decide which is the proper place in her library. The same can be 
said of the choice of subject headings. 
Notes. In quoting notes the phraseology has been freely changed for the sake 
of brevity, and no attempt has been made to indicate omissions. 
Proportion by subject. While in the beginning the attempt was made to 
adhere fairly closely to the proportion of titles to each subject given in the 1904 
Catalog, it was found impossible to do so without impairing the usefulness of the 
list. The output of books in the subjects grouped under Sociology has been so 
great, and the demand for them so heavy, that it seemed better to include a larger 
number than was originally planned rather than risk weakening the usefulness of 
the section. The greatest increase has been in Useful Arts, and this was intentional, 
since there is no division where the average librarian is more in need of help, nor 
where it is more difficult to find the ‘‘best book’’ on short notice. The proportions 
for the 1904 and the present Catalog are printed here for ease of comparison.

In the 1904 Catalog the children’s books were included in the main list. The num- 
ber of volumes cited for this Catalog does not include titles mentioned in the notes. 
Special lists. Two special lists are incorporated in the Catalog, both in answer 
to definite requests, One is a selection of about 50 titles of religious books specially 
chosen for Catholic readers. Two preliminary selections were made, one by an as- 
sistant in the St. Louis Public Library at the request of the librarian, Dr A. E. 
Bostwick, and the second by Rev. W. J. McMullen of Pittsburgh, at the request of the 
librarian of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Mr H. Wi Craver. Both lists were 
then incorporated into a much more extensive one, covering all subjects, compiled by 
Mr William Stetson Merrill, of the Newberry Library. The final selection, limited 
with a few exceptions to religious books, was submitted to Archbishop Ireland, and 
at his request was examined by the Reverend J. A. Ryan, of the St. Paul Seminary, 
St. Paul, Minn.

  PREFACE 4 
The second list consists of about 50 titles of modern drama and books about it. 
It was impossible to get any unanimity of opinion on such a brief selection and the 
editor is aware that it will satisfy a very small proportion of libraries. It is allowed 
to stand, however, for the assistance it may give to the perplexed librarian of the 
smaller library. In most libraries the selection in this subject must be based largely 
on the local demand, and if activity in play-writing and reading continues to increase 
as rapidly as in the last two years the problem of selection bids fair to rival that of 
fiction. 
Selection. It is hardly to be imagined that any one ever prepared a list of this 
character and extent without wishing to ask the indulgence of possible crities and 
to explain why it is so much farther from perfection than it was expected to be. It 
seems a fairly simple task to select 3000 titles from the books published in eight 
years, but a list based on the cooperation of about 75 librarians and 100 experts, all 
fully engaged with their own work, and selected, edited and prepared for printing 
in intervals of work having a prior claim, is bound-to progress but slowly and te 
suffer many changes of fortune. One needs to have been this sort of clearing house 
of opinion but once to realize how far apart our libraries are in the matter of book 
selection. In many cases what is one library’s meat seems to be another’s poison, 
and one soon reaches the conviction that there are no ‘‘best books’’ on any subject 
for a library of any size—if librarians alone are to be consulted. Happily, pro- 
fessors, special students and experts in general are less at variance. It is only fair 
to say that the Fiction and Children’s lists represent librarians’ votes only. It is 
to be doubted if the Fiction, at least, would have retained the proper amount of 
“light reading’’ if it had passed through the hands of literature professors. If it 
does not prove a good ‘‘working’’ selection the editor will be greatly disappointed, 
for it was on that ground alone that many titles escaped the deleting pencil. 
Acknowledgments. First the editor wishes to express her gratitude to the 
men and women who, without the special interest to be expected of librarians, gave 
of their valuable time—some of them with great generosity—in order to perfect the 
selection in their special subjects. That not all the titles recommended are included, 
nor all the titles receiving adverse criticism thrown out, does not argue that their 
opinions were not seriously considered, but is due to the many limitations of such a 
list—in number of titles, date, expense, availability, degree of difficulty or special 
nature of the books. In Philosophy and Ethics, thanks are due Professors Hugo 
Miinsterberg, G. H. Palmer, F. G. Peabody, Joseph Jastrow; in Religion, Profes- 
sors J. H. Ropes, F. G. Peabody, C. 8. Thayer, and the Reverends W. J. McMullen,

Cordial thanks are extended also to the librarians and library assistants, representing 
large and medium-sized libraries in all parts of the coufhtry except the extreme 
South, who criticized the preliminary lists. Individual mention must be made of 
those of whom assistance was requested in special subjects because of their extensive 
acquaintance with the literature: Mr A. C. Tilton, formerly in charge of the docu- 
ment department of the Wisconsin State Historical Library, who made the first se- 
lection of government documents; Mr E. H. Virgin, librarian of General Theological 
Seminary, New York, and Mr A. C. Zenos, librarian of McCormick Theological Semi- 
nary, Chicago, for criticism of the titles in Religion, and Mr W. S. Merrill, head 
classifier of the Newberry Library, Chicago, for assistance in the selection of Catholic 
books; Miss Elizabeth Baldwin, librarian of Teachers College, New York, and Miss 
Irene Warren,.librarian of the School of Education of the University of Chicago, who 
criticized the books on Education; Miss O. M. Imhoff, of the Legislative Reference 
Department of the Wisconsin Library Commission, for aid in the selection of titles 
in Sociology and Government; Mr E. H. McClelland, technology librarian of the 
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and Mr E. D. Tweedell, reference librarian of the 
John Crerar Library, Chicago, who gave very generously of their time to the selec- 
tion in Science and Useful arts; Mr G. W. Lee, librarian of Stone & Webster, Boston, 
and Miss L. B. Krause, librarian of H. M. Byllesby & Co., Chicago, for criticism 
of Engineering works; Miss C. R. Barnett, librarian of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, and Mr Clarence Hean, librarian of the College of Agriculture Library 
of the University of Wisconsin, for criticism of Agriculture titles; Mr E. R. Smith, 
librarian of the Avery Architectural Library of Columbia University, and Miss 
Katharine Patten, librarian of the Minneapolis Athenaeum, for criticism of the Fine

arts list; Miss L. M. Hooper, librarian of the Brookline (Mass.) Public Library, for 
criticism of the Music list; Dr R. G. Thwaites, director of the State Historical So- 
ciety of Wisconsin, for criticism of the titles in American history and travel; Dr 
B. C. Steiner, librarian of Enoch Pratt Free Library, for criticism of the titles in 
American history and biography. 
Acknowledgment is made of the services of the Annotation Section of the New 
York State Library, and especially of its head, Miss M. T. Wheeler, in selecting and 
mounting titles of current works to be used as a basis for the proposed supplement 
to the 1904 Catalog, from the time of the publication of that work to the summer of 
1909, when with the decision to have the later catalog prepared directly under the 
auspices of the A. L. A. Publishing Board, this valuable material was transferred 
to the editor. Of even greater assistance have been the files of the annual Best books 
lists, which have been drawn on very considerably for notes. 
To Mrs H. L. Elmendorf, vice-librarian of the Buffalo Public Wier and presi- 
dent of the American Library Association, appointed from the A. L. A. Publishing 
Board as the committee of one to whom all questions of policy and details of execu- 
tion could be submitted, grateful recognition is made for the willingness and prompt- 
ness with which she has met all requests for advice or assistance. Gratitude is also 
due to the three regular assistants of the A. L. A. Booklist staff, to whom for some 
portion of each month during the past year this Catalog has meant an extra burden, 
to be met only by additional hours of work.

bird-lover.

This biography, by Hamilton’s grandson, con-

Exhaustive, scholarly biography, the most com-

The life of William Thomson, baron Kelvin of

Tells the story of Charles and Mary Lamb as

editorial comment, rather than a systematic 
biography. Jerrold’s Charles Lamb (Bell’s minia- 
ture ser. of great writers, Macmillan, 1905, 112p., 
50c, W6-78) is an excellent introduction to the 
study of Lamb, briefly sketching his life and

Lee, Robert Edward. Recollections and letters. 
1904. 461p. illus. Doubleday $2.50 n 
Gives some important new information on Lee’s 
military service, but more on his post-bellum life 
and work as teacher. Page’s Robert HE. Lee, man 
and soldier (Scribner, 1911, 734p., $2.50 n, 
11-31778) is a picturesque but uncritical biogra- 
phy, dealing more with Lee’s military career and 
with a glowing picture of Virginia life than does 
Bradford’s Lee, the American (Houghton, 1912, 
324p., $2.50 n, 12-7039), which is less a biogra- 
phy than a well documented study of Lee’s per-

with many of England’s most famous figures in 
art, literature and politics. Not wholly satisfac- 
tory as a life of Miss Terry but a breezy recital 
of experiences and frank, discriminating judg- 
ments of fellow actors.

The most detailed account of Tintoretto’s life 
and work that has yet appeared, but no more 
discriminatingly critical than Osler (in A. L. A.

Holborn (1908) or in Thode (1901) though they 
are not so representative as in the latter work.

Intimate and sympathetic but by no means 
blindly partisan biography, meant to be “rather 
a plain narration than an attempt to rectify or 
correct opinions and theories.” Based chiefly on 
Tolstoi’s supposedly autobiographic writings and 
the biographies by Maude, Behrs, Steiner and 
Birukoff. The best single-volume biography for 
American readers. The most comprehensive biog: 
raphy in English is Maude’s Life of Tolsto: 
(Dodd, 1910, 2v., $6 n, A11-564), a large part 
of which was read and approved by Tolstoi him- 
self. 
Tolstoi, Liov Nikolaevich, graf 11-29393/2

A sympathetic study of Turgenev, the early 
influences which shaped his conceptions of life 
and his real self as shown in his works, takes 
up two thirds of the volume, the rest of which 
is devoted to a similar study of Tolstoy, with 
some slight comparison of the two men.

Two series of letters written from Rome, 1880—

greater value than many of the biographies but 
not a volume that will attract the casual reader. 
Wagnerjs My life (Dodd, 1911, 2v., $8.50 n, 11- 
16280) is an exceedingly frank and simple auto- 
biography covering Wagner’s life to 1864 only, 
thus containing nothing concerning his last 19

Vivid, dramatic and intensely interesting ac-

was connected. An unsatisfactory compilation of 
letters, reports, etc., with explanatory comments 
by his wife, complete the account from 1864.

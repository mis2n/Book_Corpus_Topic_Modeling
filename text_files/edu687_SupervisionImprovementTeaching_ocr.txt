    PREFACE 
This book is an attempt to discuss concretely the prob- 
lems and procedures of the elementary-school supervisor. 
The problems have been organized into related groups, the 
underlying principles briefly summarized, and a super- 
visory procedure outlined. Every effort has been made to 
keep the discussion concrete and specific, though in some 
places a generalization was all that could be advanced. 
The theory and practice of supervision outlined are based 
upon several years of experience as teacher and supervisor. 
All the outlines and score cards were evolved and used under 
practical conditions in regular graded schools. Exact, ex- 
perimentally determined evidence has been used to support 
statements wherever it was available. Failing such evi- 
dence, recourse has been had to expert opinion. The manu- 
script was read by a number of men prominent in education 
and many of the suggestions they kindly made have been 
incorporated in the discussion. The reports on some things, 
however, were quite bewildering, because the suggestions 
from different men were so flatly contradictory. Hence 
material criticised by some reviewers has been retained be- 
cause the nature of the reports led me to believe that the 
points were not so much incorrect as controversial. On 
the other hand, I am keenly aware that later critics may 
find a number of real errors which have escaped my notice. 
Nothing that is said is meant to be dogmatic, nor is it to 
be regarded as final. The discussion is designed, rather, to 
stimulate supervisors to study their problems and to im- 
prove their technique. No apology is made for the several 
generalizations given. As much concrete material as pos- 
vu

sible has been included, but a complete detailed treatment 
would necessitate a library rather than a volume. 
A few reviewers suggested that a better organization 
would be to outline a definite plan of supervision for a 
year or half year, and then deduce the principles and 
procedures by means of a discussion of that plan. This 
would be undoubtedly an excellent scheme, but I do not 
feel that the scheme adopted is any less logical, namely, 
to attempt a definition of the field of supervision, to collect 
the information bearing upon it, and to point out that the 
supervisor should organize his own plans within the limits 
set up. A definite plan of supervision is an absolute essen- 
tial, but it must be organized in terms of the situation 
involved and should be organized anew rather frequently. 
Such plans are discussed several times in the later chapters. 
It may be felt that the treatment of teaching method 
given in Chapters V to XI is out of place in a text in 
supervision. Strictly speaking, this criticism is justifiable. 
On the other hand, it is undoubtedly true that the super- 
visors who are thoroughly expert in modern teaching 
» method are in the minority. Hence this body of material, 
which can be omitted by the few supervisory experts, 
should be valuable to a large number of untrained and 
partly trained supervisors. Furthermore, one of the prin- 
cipal purposes of this book is to try to bring teachers and 
supervisors more into accord and to break down, if pos- 
sible, the antagonism that is quite marked in many situa- 
tions. Accordingly the teachers’ method, problems, and 
viewpoint are given considerable space and attention. On 
the other hand, supervision is presented as much for the 
teacher’s reading as it is for the supervisor’s. Something 
may have been sacrificed of theoretically correct organiza- 
tion for the sake of practical benefit to a larger number 
of readers. Because of actual experience, and because of 
opinions expressed by many teachers and supervisors in 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
( 
  PREFACE ix 
my classes, I am convinced that this treatment of both 
sides of the question will prove more useful than a some- 
what more scientific organization confined strictly to super- 
vision. My point of view is summarized in the report of 
one reviewer: ‘‘This book is written for supervisors as they | 
are, not as they should be.’’ 
The book is designed, first, for superintendents, building 
principals, and grade supervisors. Ideally, the building 
principal should be the chief supervisory officer, but his 
efforts must necessarily be supplemented by those of 
regular grade supervisors. This group will find their chief 
benefit in study and use of the supervisory outlines at the 
close of the chapters on method and in the remaining 
chapters dealing with the other functions of supervision. 
The body of the chapters on method will probably be 
familiar to the better trained of the group and can be 
used as reference material for their teachers. The question 
outlines in terms of teacher and pupil activity can be 
used in observing or discussing teaching. It should be 
noted in passing that the supervisor should supplement this 
summary of general method by constant use of the many 
excellent texts on special method. Rural supervisors and 
special supervisors, particularly the former, will find con- 
siderable material that will prove useful though the dis- 
cussion was not planned with their specific problems in 
mind. 
Second, the book is so written that teachers may receive 
two benefits from its study. Beginning and inadequately 
trained teachers can profit from a study of the principles 
of method, the principles of learning, and the discussion 
of subject matter. All teachers can gain an insight into 
the supervisory problem and point of view. This latter is 
the more valuable, because, as stated above, supervision 
should be a codperative procedure, and antagonism between 
the two groups involved should disappear. 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
    x PREFACE 
Third, the book should appeal to students of supervision 
and teaching method. College and normal-school classes 
in either supervision or general method will, it is believed, 
find it an interesting and helpful textbook. 
Attention is called to the annotated bibliography at the 
end of each chapter. Each title listed has been carefully 
examined, and its nature is indicated in the note. Sup- 
plementary material on any point can be quickly found, 
and because of this fact several chapters have been pur- 
posely abbreviated. Chapters III and IV contain only 
brief summaries of the salient points in the fields treated. 
Such summaries will recall the supervisor’s knowledge and 
focus his attention, but students using the book should do 
considerably more reading than is there outlined. Chapter 
XII does not contain any examples of specific tests or scales. 
Despite criticism by some reviewers, such material is de- 
liberately omitted, because it is easily obtainable elsewhere, 
and because its inclusion would unduly lengthen the book. 
I am forever indebted to Professor Thomas H. Gentle, 
sometime student at Jena, Germany, later director of 
various normal training schools in this country, now resid- 
ing near Independnee, Oregon. Not only did my first and 
best explanation of the aim of education and of pedagogical 
principles come from Professor Gentle, but his friendship 
and kindly counsel have been for many years sources of 
pleasure and inspiration. 
A second important influence came through contact with 
Professor S. C. Parker of the University of Chicago. I 
gained much in scientific attitude and in enthusiasm for 
teaching through my classes and individual work with him. 
His kind permission has made possible much direct quota- 
tion from his textbooks.

colleagues, Dr. Cliff W. Stone, Washington State College, 
and Professor W. A. Owens, Winona State Teachers Col-

lege, kindly read part or all of the manuscript and sug 
gested a number of improvements. My wife, Virginia 
Burton, a teacher with considerable experience under dif 
ferent systems of supervision, supplied many valuable cor- 
erete illustrations. Thanks are due Superintendent George 
W. Hug of Salem, Oregon, for the free hand given me 
in experimenting with supervisory devices in the schools 
of McMinnville, Oregon, while they were under Mr. Hug’s 
direction. Finally, much credit is due the advanced 
students and graduates of the School of Education of 
Washington State College for aid in making and correcting 
through trial in real situations many of the theories and 
procedures advocated.

CHAPTER I 
THE NATURE OF SUPERVISION 
What is Supervision?—The superintendent of a certain 
town spends a considerable part of his time in reading

critically such grade texts as come to his desk. He attends 
most of the professional gatherings in his locality and 
brings to his own system as many prominent speakers as 
he can obtain. His aim is to collect all the material possible 
that bears directly upon the improving of classroom pro- 
cedure among his teachers. Frequent meetings are held at 
which the teachers discuss what—has been presented 
previously, or material to which they have been referred. 
Free discussion is encouraged at these meetings and many 
of the suggestions made are put into effect. Frequent 
visits are made to the classrooms, followed by conferences 
on the problems of pedagogy, of classification and grading, 
of discipline, ete. The sum total of these activities, briefly 
outlined here, this superintendent calls supervision. 
While most teachers could not formulate, on the spur 
of the moment, a definition of supervision, or summarize 
it briefly, they would probably agree, upon reading the 
above paragraph, that it included in the main their ideas 
on supervision. But is the idea of supervision there out-

lined universal? Would it be accepted by all teachers or 
administrators? How much of supervisory practice con- 
forms to it? Let us examine some uses of the term. 
In another city a course in mental testing was given to 
the grade teachers in order that they might be reasonably 
familiar with the uses of mental tests and with the interpre- 
tation of results. One of the grade principals dropped in 
and was asked if he wished to participate in the actual 
work of the course; he replied: ‘‘Oh no, I’ll just look on 
a few minutes so that I may be able to supervise my teachers 
as they use the tests.’”’ His remark indicates an idea 
regarding supervision quite different from that of the first 
illustration. 
In a prominent technical school, one of the deans directed 
his department heads to undertake the supervision of in- 
struction in their respective departments. The instructors 
were visited and so-called supervisory reports were turned in. 
One instructor spent the entire period reading aloud from 
the textbook. Not only was the book the same as the one 
in the hands of the students, but the reading was so rapid 
as to prohibit note-taking had it been new material. The 
students asserted that this was the usual method of teach- 
ing. The supervisor in this case felt that the requirements 
of good supervision had been fulfilled in the following brief 
report: ‘‘Mr. V- is a remarkably fine teacher because 
his delivery is so clear-cut and distinct.’’ 
In a certain training school there was once a president 
whose abilities were more political than pedagogical. His 
chief service to the school seemed to consist in what he 
called supervision of his faculty. Incidentally he taught 
one class in school management, a subject in which he was 
unfortunately somewhat ignorant. The students opened 
their books and one was called upon to read aloud the 
first paragraph of the assignment. Another student was 
then called upon to give in his own words the gist of the   
 
-P-A-G-E-25
THE NATURE OF SUPERVISION 5 
paragraph read. This procedure varied not a jot, regard- 
less of the length of the paragraphs, and continued through 
the course. Not a single supplementary idea entered, not 
a minute was given to discussion. The president called this 
the ‘‘textbook method’’ of teaching. 
During his spare time, which was quite abundant, he 
engaged in supervision. This consisted of visiting the 
members of the faculty, expounding to them the merits 
and excellences of the ‘‘textbook method,’’ at the same 
time pointing out the errors in such fads as the socialized 
recitation, the project method, and the adaptation of in- 
struction to individual differences. These activities and 
attempts at the unification of pedagogy were for him the 
essentials of supervision. 
It is evident that each of the school men here referred 
to had an idea of something called supervision, and prob- 
ably each could have formulated a definition if asked. It 
is also evident that the definitions, if true to practice, 
would have differed quite materially. This is the first 
thing that strikes the student upon delving into the litera- 
ture on supervision, namely, the numerous differing defini- 
tions. This is due in part to the fact that supervision is 
evolving, and also to the fact that its importance has been 
recognized only rather recently. 
Early Definitions.—There seem to be no studies devoted 
primarily to the history and development of supervision, 
though many isolated pieces of this history can be found 
in recent articles and books. - : 
The duties of a school head were at first mainly man--~~ 
agerial, that is, concerned with running the school plant, 
adjusting routine factors, advising with the board, buying 
material and equipment, selecting and rejecting teachers, 
ete. Within the last generation, however, there arose an 
insistent demand that the schools should be related more 
closely to the activities and needs of the particular com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
6 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
munity. The advertising of the school system and its work 
became prominent. All of this coérdinating, socializing, 
and advertising was added to the work of the administrator. 
But with both of these functions performed faithfully and 
efficiently, it was found that a school was not necessarily 
successful. It did not, in many instances, produce certain 
definite results that the community had a right to expect. 
Thus was opened up that field of educational activity known 
in general as supervision. The attention of the adminis- 
trator was directed to this new duty, namely, the improve- 
ment of the instructional processes and the improvement 
of teachers in service. At first the work involved in this 
new departure was simply added to the already numerous 
tasks of the administrator. This relationship to adminis- 
tration is shown by the careless use of the two terms 
“administration’’ and ‘‘supervision’’ by educational writ- 
ers and speakers. Many undergraduate students, and not 
a few graduates, confuse the two terms, as shown by their 
rejection of courses in supervision with the remark that 
they ‘‘took administration last semester.’? The present 
tendency, however, is to make a definite separation of the 
supervisory duties, and in many places they are coming 
to be regarded as the most important duties, relegating the 
others to the background to be taken care of by a business 
manager, secretary, or specially trained clerk. More and 
more time is given the superintendent or principal for this 
work. In large cities assistant superintendents are ap- 
pointed whose work is largely supervisory. In addition, 
school officers specifically designated as supervisors have 
come into being, at first for the so-called special subjects, 
and later for the regular subjects of the elementary 
curriculum. 
Very probably some contribution was made to the theory 
of supervision and to the evolution of supervisory officers 
‘from the other side of the system. Here and there in
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE NATURE OF SUPERVISION 7? 
isolated schools, or for peculiar local conditions, one teacher 
was selected and made responsible for certain things. This 
served to make prominent the possibility of improving 
routine factors and, later, instructional elements by turn- 
ing over such tasks definitely to some one individual. 
The word ‘‘supervision’’ first appeared, according to 
Coffman, in the early ’70’s, but the attempts to define 
supervision were, he states, ‘‘ grimly humorous.’’ As sam- 
ples he cites the following,? some of them gathered from 
writers of distinction: 
The business of a supervisor is to cast a genial influence over 
his schools, but otherwise he is not to interfere with the work. 
Supervision is taking a broad view, the general view, and 
seeing the back and middle grounds as well as the foreground , 
with its details. . . | Supervision is the vision in the old and \ 
beautiful sense of seeing things invisible. 
The supervisor, in relation to the scholarship of his schools, is 
as a traveler going into a far country to earn wages and to bring 
back tréasures from its vast stores-of wealth. In relation to the 
children and youth, the supervisor is as a pioneer going into a 
great wilderness of primeval forests to make there a home of 
civilization. In relation to the schools, the supervisor is as a 
sea captain of the medieval time upon a chartless sea. 
Tentative Statement of the Nature and Scope of Super- 
vision.— The above samples are typical of the meaningless 
platitudes that passed as definitions, and they fully deserve 
Coffman’s description, ‘‘grimly humorous.’’ However, 
many of the more recent definitions are more objective, 
specific, and exact. Supervision as a school activity is in 
full swing in practically all of the larger cities and is 
spreading to smaller systems. Rural supervision has long 
since proved its worth and is in operation in many states.

8 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
The functions of supervisory officers are set forth with 
more and more agreement in recent articles and survey 
reports. ‘ 
As yet there are practically no studies in print showing 
the results of supervision in mathematically precise, ob- 
jective terms. The pioneer article in this line, that by 
Courtis,? presents some measured conclusions based upon 
a comparison of supervised and non-supervised schools. 
The experiment was carefully controlled and extended 
over a sufficient length of time to be authoritative. The 
results showed that the geography work in specially super- 
vised schools was, when measured by standard tests, 
markedly superior to the work in schools with ordinary 
supervision. The latter schools were again superior to 
those having no supervision at all. Other experiments are 
to be made to determine more specifically the worth of 
certain supervisory devices. Courtis’ experiment is a 
promise of what is to come and points out a wide field 
for the experimentalist. Supervision will ultimately rest 
upon a set of principles and standards and comprise pro- 
cedures that have been experimentally demonstrated and 
proved. Then good and bad supervision will not be a 
matter of opinion, but a difference in the possession of, 
and skill in the use of, these demonstrated principles and 
arts.® 
Awaiting the evolution of experimentally determined 
definitions of supervision and its functions, we turn to 
expert opinion. Many excellent statements as to the 
nature of supervision are to be found in the very recent 
literature, any of which would serve satisfactorily as a

and Society, vol. x.

apeared too late for discussion here, will be found in M. 8S. Pittman, 
The Value of School Supervision (Warwick and York, 1921).
-P-A-G-E-29
THE NATURE OF SUPERVISION 9 
starting point. The one quoted below is from an article 
by Gray: * 
The function of supervision is the improvement of instruction, \ 
the encouragement of good work, and the constructive elimination 
of ineffective efforts and misapplied energy . . . Expert super- 
vision should lead teachers to a broad vision of teaching prob- 
lems, to a broad range of experience, so that the work of one 
grade may be seen in relation to the work of other grades, to an 
understanding of needed revisions, of necessary growth, and 
of the final outcomes of instruction. 
  The general statements regarding supervision, as typi- 
fied by the above, can be made more specific by a study 
of the causes of success and failure in teachers as reported 
by careful and competent observers. The chief quali-\ 
fications for successful teaching seem to be instructional 
skill, ability to discipline, initiative, experience. The 
chief causes of failure may be summarized as follows: 
poor instruction, weak personality, poor discipline, lack of 
professional interest, failure to codperate, a schol- 
arship, poor health.® 
Based upon a careful review of the literature, some of 
which is referred to in the preceding paragraphs, and 
upon experience as a supervisor and teacher of super- 
visory theory, the following tentative statement regarding 
the nature of supervision is advanced. Supervision has 
to do with: ji 
1. The improvement of the teaching act. The super- 
visor is concerned with bettering the teacher’s knowledge 
and use of the principles underlying the pupil’s learning

process and the teacher’s method. Such routine factors as 
affect the operation of the learning process are included 
here. 
2. The selection and organization of subject matter. 
8. Testing and measuring. The supervisor should use or 
direct the use of standard intelligence tests in order to 
determine mental fitness, individual difference, etc. The 
same is true of the use of standard educational measuring 
scales and tests for the measurement of instructional results 
and for the diagnosis of certain pupil difficulties. 
4. The improvement of teachers in service. The means 
of improvement included here will be those not already 
included above, such as meetings, lectures, correspondence 
courses, summer schools, bulletins, intervisitation, ete. 
5. The rating of teachers. 
This brief statement will be made more specific in the 
next chapter through the listing of a series of problems, 
classified in terms of the definition above. The remainder 
of the book will attempt to show as specifically as possible 
how the supervisor may best accomplish the work allotted 
to him. 
Principles That Should Operate in Supervisory Pro- 
cedure.—The following’ principles or theses may be 
regarded as underlying any good programme of supervi- 
sion; they are not all mutually exclusive, nor, in all prob- 
ability, is the list complete: 
1. The aim of supervision is the improvement of teaching. 
2. Supervision will inspire and encourage the good 
teacher to further study, to experimentation, to prepara- 
tion for higher positions and more responsibility. 
3. Supervision will re-direct and improve the work of the 
average and mediocre teacher. It wil eliminate those 
teachers who fail to measure up to definite standards of 
good teaching. 
4. Supervision proceeds upon the basis of definite, well
-P-A-G-E-31
       THE NATURE OF SUPERVISION il 
  understood standards. As stated above, there do not exist 
for some things any proven standards. Many attempts 
have been made to set up standards of opinion and to pro- 
vide for reasonably accurate judgment in terms of them. 
In the formal subjects there are now many tests and meas- 
urements which the supervisor may use, with some qualifica- 
tions, in judging the worth of teaching. For other sub- 
jects and phases of school work supervisory summaries will 
be found at the conclusion of each chapter in this book. 
They are designed to provide a definite and controlled 
scheme for the forming of intelligent opinions, in the ab- | 
sence of mathematically precise standards. 
5. Supervision proceeds upon the basis of a definite, 
organized programme, Just as there is a course of study for 
the teachers there should be a programme for the super- 
visors, setting forth the objectives for the semester or year 
and the means of attaining them. This programme must 
be progressive from year to year. 
6. Supervision must supply the means of enabling , 
teachers to live up to the standards set and to carry out the 
programme outlined. That is, by securing subject matter, 
materials, ete. The supervisor must be ever available and . 
in readiness to give assistance or advice. 
7. Supervision is essentially a codperative procedure. It 
organizes and codrdinates the efforts of all who are con- 
cerned with the instructional side of the system. The 
standards and programme of supervision must be fully un- 
derstood by those supervised as well as by the supervisors. 
Teachers may participate in determining some of the 
standards and a part of the programme. They should be 
free to discuss supervisory judgments and to make such 
contribution as experience and training entitle them to. 
8. While the application of the standards and the realiza- 
tion of the programme must be authoritative, scientific, and
-P-A-G-E-32
  Vv 12 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
impersonal, there must be manifest a kindly and sym- 
pathetic spirit. 
9. Supervision must develop and encourage on the part 
of the teachers, initiative, self-reliance, intelligent independ- 
ence, and the successful assumption of responsibility. It 
must capitalize the teacher’s ability and experience. 
10. The administrative aspect of supervision is secondary 
to the pedagogical. 
11. When supervision is inspectorial, it should never be 
simply that and nothing more. Judgments should not be 
passed upon the basis of brief inspectorial visits. Before 
such visits are possible and safe, the supervisor must have 
spent considerable time becoming acquainted with the par- 
ticular situation and its background. Given a thorough 
acquaintance with the situation and an expert knowledge 
of the principles that apply, much purely inspectorial work 
can be done in short order. 
12. Supervision must be judged by its results. Checks 
can be devised by administrators, and teachers must also be 
called upon to express their opinions. 
13. The supervisor must be specifically and definitely 
trained for his work. 
14. The type of democratic leadership involved in super- 
vision demands the very highest type of well rounded, 
poised personality. 
Criticisms of Supervision—This book proceeds upon 
the assumption that supervision is an integral, necessary, 
and vital phase of an educational programme. No space will 
be taken to support this assumption, other than to state 
the two chief reasons for it. First, the standards of 
teacher training in this country are absurdly and disgrace- 
fully low. Asa corollary to that, the average of technical 
training possessed by teachers is pitifully inadequate. 
Second, the work of educating and training great numbers 
of future free citizens is too intricate, delicate, and vital a 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  
  THE NATURE OF SUPERVISION 13 
phase of government to be allowed to proceed without 
highly trained, expert leadership. If these two facts are 
not sufficient basis for the assumption, there would be no 
gain from arguing the matter at greater length. 
However, it must be noted in passing that there are 
many, and sometimes violent, criticisms of supervision. 
Some of the criticisms are due to a deadening, non- 
inspirational type of supervision which is in reality mere 
routine inspection by inexpert and untrained individuals. 
This was a product of the first stage in the evolution of 
supervision, when this duty was added, as noted above, 
to the already heavy load of the overworked adminis- 
trator. It must be admitted that this type of supervision 
is still very common. Better training of supervisors and 
higher standards of performance will progressively elim- 
inate it. 
The persistence of the wrong type of inspectorial super- 
vision has been due in part to another cause than the con- 
ditions under which supervision came into being. We 
have not yet completely imbued our practice with our best 
theory. The trend in all human relationships to-day is 
democratic, but many administrators are not yet com- 
pletely free from ideas of benevolent despotism or from 
ideas regarding the excellence of autocratic direction from 
above. The medieval ideas regarding the infallibility of 
those in power seem to permeate the thinking of many 
people even at this late day. It seems fair to say that 
much that is to be criticised in supervision is due to the 
persistence, consciously or unconsciously, of the ideas just 
mentioned. Teachers, however, should not allow the idea 
to possess them that this is a fault peculiar to school - 
administration and supervision. Most of the conflict in 
the world to-day, the World War, the issues between cap- 
ital and labor, the legislative battles for laws and amend- 
ments, are attempts more or less direct to adjust present
-P-A-G-E-34
  4 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
conditions more nearly in accord with democratic ideas 
of leadership. The school teacher is in no worse a con- 
dition, and usually in a far better condition, than is the 
worker in any other field of human endeavor. A more 
detailed discussion of this and other criticisms of super- 
vision will be found in Chapter XVI.

  CHAPTER II 
THE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION 
We have advanced a somewhat general definition of 
supervision—that it is concerned: with improving the teach- 
ing act, selecting and organizing subject matter, testing 
mental fitness and instructional results, improving teachers 
in service, and the rating of teachers. How can this be 
made more specific? What things shall the supervisor 
look for? How may he know whether his assistance is 
needed, desired, or. unnecessary? What questions will be 
asked of him? What problems will confront him? What 
procedures shall he use in a given situation? 
Gray? reports a study in which teachers were asked to 
list the problems on which they needed help. The problems 
listed below, approximately in the order of their frequency, 
are typical of those that will confront the supervisor : 
1. How to teach pupils to read silently and to study effectively. 
2. How to conduct supervised study periods effectively. 
3. How to secure an adequate amount of appropriate reference 
material. : 
4. How to teach problem-solving exercises effectively. 
5. How to conduct a socialized recitation effectively. 
6. How to keep bright pupils busy and slow ones up to stand- 
ard. 
7. How to secure better home work when there are no super- 
vised study periods. 
8. What are the most prominent outcomes of instruction in 
each subject?

9. Where to place the emphasis in each subject and how to 
progress with sufficient rapidity. 
10. What are appropriate standards of work for each grade? 
11. How to find out the most effective helps, references, maps, 
devices, materials, etc., for teaching each subject. 
12. How to interest and control unruly pupils. 
13. Special problems relating to particular subjects: 
(a) How to teach such texts as Tarr and McMurry’s 
Geography when pupils are unable to read them 
understandingly. 
(b) How to make language work as interesting as arith- 
metic. 
(c) How to make the work in geography interesting to all 
pupils. 
(d@) How to make knowledge of correct forms in English 
function in free expression. 
(e) How much time should be spent in map study in the 
seventh grade? 
(f) How to teach long division effectively. 
(g) How to stress industrial and commercial geography in 
a vital way. 
(h) How to secure correct movement and letter form in all 
written work. 
Problems Involved in Improving Classroom Procedure. 
—tThis field of supervisory activity involves not only ques- 
tions of method, but also problems relating to routine 
factors and to discipline, both of which vitally affect 
eee bee the problems that will present 
themselves, or that will be raised by teachers, will vary 
from the simplest matters, which can be cared for in a few 
minutes, to questions involving several people and requir- 
ing the utmost skill and tact for adjustment. 
Some of the younger teachers are certain to need advice 
and direction in such matters as passing their pupils 
through the halls, to the basement, to the blackboard, ‘to 
the cloakroom, ete. Some teachers seemingly cannot in- 
elude in their automatic activities the regulation of heat 
and ventilation. Still others are very careless of supplies,

-P-A-G-E-39
  THE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION 19 
and show an inability to organize _a monitor system or 
other device for passing and collecting such supplies as 
are needed. 
There are teachers in every system known for their 
ability to ‘‘straighten out’’ a difficult room. No class is 
too rude or undisciplined for this type of teacher; she 
soon has them behaving themselves, and liking it. When 
a teacher can thus handle a room and retain the genuine 
affection and respect of the children, she is looked upon as 
a good disciplinarian. So far, so good. But in many cases 
the children revert to their previous undisciplined attitude 
immediately upon being transferred to another room. Some- 
times they are as rude as ever on the playground, although 
behaving in the room of the strong teacher. In this latter 
situation, what is the supervisor’s problem? What prin- 
ciples are to guide him in analysis? How shall he discuss 
the matter with the teacher? e 
A young teacher may make a good start; the children 
like her, behave well, and work hard. Apparently without 
cause a change takes place; the order deteriorates faster 
and faster until the room is wild and undisciplined, and 
the pupils learn nothing. The teacher feels that she has 
not changed her methods or viewpoint and is genuinely 
distressed by her apparent failure. Again the supervisor 
is presented with a difficult situation to analyze, for which 
he must evolve a solution. 
In the field of method the problems are innumerable in 
type. Quite a large percentage of normal-school grad- 
uates will try to apply their notes and lesson plans regard- 
less of changed conditions. A common illustration of this 
type of error is drill upon a language error not present 
in the vocabulary of the class but for which the teacher 
has a good lesson plan from the normal school ‘‘special- 
method’’ course. On the other hand, some experienced 
teachers will insist on teaching some things a certain way
-P-A-G-E-40

20 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  because they ‘‘have done it this way for the last eleven 
years.’’? A nature-study enthusiast will insist on teaching 
this subject exactly as she did in a totally different geo- 
graphical region. Art and music teachers do a number of 
things they claim will develop an appreciation of the 
beautiful, but which seem to the unprejudiced observer to 
be a waste of time. What attitude should the supervisor 
take in such a case? Has he a right to insist on some 
definite statements in regard to the nature of appreciation 
and the means of obtaining it? Will appreciation be 
Killed by definiteness, or can some intelligent statements 
be made in regard to it without danger of formalism? A 
teacher will observe a socialized recitation and be greatly 
impressed by the interest, enthusiasm, and apparent power 
on the part of the children. But when she tries it, she will 
be amazed at the inability of her pupils to gather and 
evaluate evidence and to verify conclusions. She cannot 
understand why it does not go. In this case the super- 
visor can be of immediate assistance. Teachers will be 
constantly asking for explanations of the project method 
and for examples of its use. Supervised study also will 
furnish many of the supervisor’s problems. 
¢ In his rounds the supervisor will surely see a new and 
extremely beneficial drill device or an original exercise 
evolved by some grade teacher. He will soon learn that 
some of his teachers are extremely skillful in a particular 
line of work, for example, drill work in arithmetic or 
training children for pageants or plays. A number of 
problems are centered here. Supervisors are often criti- 
cised for stealing good things as they may see and intro- 
ducing them as personal contributions. Will mimeo- 
graphed circulars describing new devices be effective? 
Should round-table discussions be given? Should the 
supervisor teach demonstration lessons, elaborating upon 
new exercises? Should intervisitation be encouraged?
-P-A-G-E-41
THE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION 21 
Should it be insisted upon? ‘Will a teacher be jealous if 
asked to visit another in order to observe some skillful 
teaching? 
~ Problems Involved in Selecting and Organizing Subject 
Matter—A teacher or parent may state that certain 
material is not fitted for the grade to which the course of 
study assigns it. A teacher may claim that it is impossible 
to cover the amount of subject matter assigned for the 
term. Another teacher in the same grade may assert that 
she can cover the assigned work and introduce consider- 
able supplementary work in addition. Are these problems 
of subject-matter selection? Of teaching method? Of 
teacher training? Of personal bias or habits? After 
analyzing the situation and determining the trouble, what 
is the best procedure? Some of the younger teachers may 
be unable to find supplementary material, and, on the 
other hand, some of the older ones will reject any addi- 
tions as ‘‘fads.’? There may be ordered a sweeping 
change in a subject or procedure, affecting all teachers 
alike, and the supervisor will have the task of explaining 
the matter. 
New texts are selected regularly by most school dis- 
tricts and the teaching staff is being called into consulta- 
tion more and more frequently. What are the principles 
underlying the selection of subject matter? How may 
they be applied to textbooks? Does it make any differ- 
ence how large the type is on the pages of first readers? 
How does one know when the illustrations in a text are 
good? 
Problems Involved in Testing and Measuring.—The 
youngest teacher soon learns of the fact known as ‘‘indi- 
vidual variation,’’ but she does not always understand 
thatthe results are often beyond her control. Should a 
teacher worry over and struggle with a number of willing, 
earnest, but hopelessly dull pupils? How can the teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  22 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
be shown that some pupils cannot in any circum-. 
stances do the work of the average student in the same 
grade? What should be done with a class in which ten 
per cent of the children fail to complete the assignment in 
twice the allotted time, but in which another ten per cent 
of the children finish with time to spare? Will extra drill 
aid the slower ten per cent? If so, what kind of drill, 
since the usual drill does not seem to get results? If not, 
what shall be done? 
A youngster in a certain grade turns out to be lazy, 
stupid, and, in general, a bad influence? How is the 
supervisor to determine which of several possible causes 
is to blame for the situation? The cause located, what is 
the proper procedure? One pupil excels in a subject but 
is below average in most of the others. Is this due to an 
unwillingness to exert himself except in a subject he 
likes, or is he fundamentally unable to do some things as 
well, as the average? Should retarded children fail of 
promotion after repeating a grade once? Should pupils 
fail of promotion in all subjects because of failure in one? 
In two rooms under observation the work may seem to 
go with equal vim and vigor, both teachers and pupils 
being alert and active. But measured by standardized 
tests one room falls far below the other. Does this mean 
that one of the teachers is skillfully concealing poor teach- 
ing? Or should the previous history of the class be 
obtained before a judgment is passed? Are the measured 
results of instruction a fair measure of teacher efficiency 
or not? If a room scores well below the average, what 
should the supervisor do about it? 
Problems Involved in Training Teachers in Service —A 
teacher may ask permission to experiment with a new 
method of teaching, a new series of drill devices, or a new 
departure in disciplinary cases. Should the supervisor 
resent this as an implied criticism of the assistance he has
-P-A-G-E-43
         THE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION 23 
been giving, or shall he encourage the teacher and codp- 
erate to the extent of his power? To what extent shall 
experimentation be encouraged? What attitude shall a 
supervisor take toward a teacher who refuses to try any 
experiments or new methods? Some teachers object to 
coming to departmental or grade meetings. They do not 
take part in the discussions and resent any interference 
with their teaching following a demonstration lesson. 
Others are eager to find out more about their specific 
problems and desire a wider acquaintance with under- 
lying principles. What knowledge of available corre- 
spondence courses, or nearby summer schools, should the 
Supervisor be expected to have? Should he encourage 
some teachers to take summer-school work? Should he 
require some to do so? Some teachers insist that they 
have no time for professional reading, while others com- 
plain that they have no time for recreation and play. 
Shall teachers teach the same grade over and over, or 
should an occasional change of assignment be made? 
A sixth-grade teacher recently remarked to me: ‘‘Do 
you know, I’ve taught the sixth grade now for four years 
but I find that even yet there is a point or two that I have 
to look up.’? What inference might a supervisor legiti- 
mately make regarding that teacher’s ideas of profes- 
sional training? Will her training soon be complete or 
will there be a ‘‘point or two’’ still to be looked up for 
some time to come? 
Problems Involved in the Rating of Teachers——Should 
teachers be rated at all? What elements legitimately 
enter into a judgment of teacher efficiency? Should a 
teacher have any part in constructing the score card by 
which she is to be rated? Should she see the card after 
it has been checked? Has she any right to differ with the 
supervisor in regard to any of the items? How many 
different people should rate the same teacher? Can the
-P-A-G-E-44
  24 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
visitors tell anything on the basis of one visit? How many 
visits are necessary in order to form a fair estimate of the 
teacher? 
~ What weight shall be given to personality, to teaching 
skill, to preparation, to experience? Is it any of a super- 
visor’s concern with whom a teacher spends her leisure 
time? Has the supervisor a right to inquire into the hours 
kept by a teacher outside of school? 
What are the dangers in rating? The abuses? The 
benefits? Should rating be a factor in promotion? In 
salary increase? What is the relation of teacher-rating 
to improving teachers in service? Might teachers profit- 
ably rate themselves at the same time that the supervisor 
is rating them? 
Should supervisors themselves be rated? If so, by 
whom? What elements should enter into a supervisor’s 
efficiency rating? 
Problems Involved in Visiting and Conferring with the 
Teacher.—Problems in this group will vary from such 
simple ones as are involved in entering and leaving a 
room up to those involving clashes of personality that 
may disrupt a whole school or wreck a system of super- 
vision. One teacher will think the supervisor remiss if he 
does not furnish minute details as to methods and ma- 
terials, while another teacher in the same building will 
complain bitterly that her initiative and originality are 
eramped because the supervisor does furnish such details. 
Some supervisors believe something should be found to 
commend during every visit, while others take the good 
things for granted and concentrate on the errors. Which 
is the better procedure? Shall the criticism be in writing 
or by means of personal conference? If by conference, 
shall it be given at once or later on? Should there be a 
friendly colloquial tone. during the conference or must 
the supervisor maintain a certain reserve? Should teach-
-P-A-G-E-45
ee, ee 
THE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION 25 
ers be encouraged to ask questions? To keep notes and 
ask for special help on difficulties that do not present them- 
selves during the visit? 
Problems Involved in the Administrative Relationships 
of the Supervisor—Is the supervisor to regard himself as 
an administrative officer clothed with the power of such 
officers, or as an officer chiefly concerned with improving 
teachers through codperative efforts? How far should 
the supervisor be responsible for reporting teacher senti- 
ment to the administration? For how much of the man- 
agerial work of administration should the supervisor be 
responsible? Should the supervisor appear in public 
meetings? Is he responsible in any way for a share in 
educating school patrons to the needs and accomplish- 
ments of the schools? 
Plan of This Book.—The foregoing problems are but a 
very few of the great number that will present themselves. 
This book is an attempt to organize the problems of super- 
vision into related groups, briefly to set forth the under- 
lying principles, and to advance a supervisory theory, 
based thereon. 
There are two sources of information upon which to 
draw in formulating a supervisory theory. The first of 
these is that summary of principles, experimentally de- 
rived, which underlie the effective and economical teach- 
ing of various grade-school subjects. The groups of 
principles relating to the different subjects have been 
summarized here and there in books and _ periodicals. 
Probably the best statement is to be found in the 
Eighteenth Yearbook, Part 2, of the National Society for the 
Study of Education. Material of the same nature, though 
less well stated, is also contained in the Fourteenth Year- 
book, Part 1, the Sixteenth Yearbook, Part 1, and the 
Seventeenth Yearbook, Part 1. 
The other source of information is thé set of principles
-P-A-G-E-46
t 
| 
26 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
that underlies the teacher’s method and the pupil’s learn- 
ing process. These principles, also, have been summarized 
in part by different authors. The present volume will 
be confined to this body of information. The summaries of 
special-method principles, for instance, the Eighteenth 
Yearbook, are too long for inclusion and they cannot be 
abbreviated to advantage. Supervisors should be familiar 
with both types of information, and the Yearbooks referred 
to should be used in conjunction with such formulations of 
principles as are contained in this book. 
Chapters will be devoted to each of the groups of 
supervisory problems. For instance, in the discussion of 
the supervisor’s activity in improving classroom pro- 
cedure, the problems of method, of routine and discipline, 
ete., will be discussed separately. In each case there 
will be a summary of principles, together with illustra- 
tions, which would serve the teacher equally well. This 
is the supervisor’s body of text material. At the end of 
each chapter there will be an outline for the supervisor 
which should focus his attention on the vital points in the 
teacher’s procedure. Specific statements of supervisory 
procedure will be found in the body of the chapter 
as well as in the concluding outline. Where the inferred 
procedure is quite obvious, direct statement of it has been 
omitted in order to avoid too much repetition of such 
statements as ‘‘the supervisor should do thus and so,’’ or 
“the supervisor must in this case proceed as follows.’’ 
Each of the groups of problems will be treated in the same 
manner. Special chapters will be devoted to the training 
and personality of supervisors, as well as to the rating of 
their efficiency. 
Some of the discussion will apply more directly to the 
regular supervisor who travels from building to building, 
some of it to the special supervisor, and some of it prob- 
ably will apply batter to the building principal as super-

visor. Still other problems discussed will usually fall only 
to the superintendent in his supervisory capacity, or to 
his assistants who are engaged in supervision. For the 
sake of clarity of discussion and economy of space, how- 
ever, no such segregation of problems will be made. In 
most cases the proper application will be obvious. 
As stated before, experimentally determined state- 
ments have been used wherever available; failing such 
authority, the opinion of recognized experts has been 
utilized. Many things are so dependent upon ingenuity 
and adaptability that they may be learned only through 
practice. Human nature does not respond well to mimeo- 
graphed directions, so that definite pronouncements can- 
not be made in many cases. However, it is hoped that 
such statements as are made, while in no wise final, will be 
of some assistance to supervisors and will stimulate their 
best thinking toward evolving better principles of super- 
visory procedure.

CHAPTER III 
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
A certain grade-school principal is famous throughout 
the system in which he works because of the ‘‘order’’ in 
his school. He usually stands on the playground, bell in 
hand, watching over his flock. If he sees the slightest 
sign of disorder, or should he desire to hold converse with 
some child, the bell is tapped, and the children, sometimes 
three or four hundred of them, stand stock-still. The 
boys engaged in football or baseball stop in their tracks, 
or if it be marble season, the lads remain on one knee 
until permission to arise comes from the upper regions. 
Outsiders have always believed that this principal is in- 
wardly chagrined because he cannot stop the spinning 
tops, or halt the flying football in mid-air even as Joshua 
stopped the shining sun. The children march into the 
building in perfect order, and out the same way. The 
lines are straight and there is no scuffling in the cloak- 
room. There is no laughter in the halls or classrooms— 
and little on the playground. 
In the same city is another grade school which has its one 
lone rule in plain view in the assembly hall: ‘‘Be careful 
of others’ rights; do your work; or leave.’’ The children 
in this school do not march in and out in serried rows, 
there is some scuffling in the hallways, the floors and 
furniture get scratched up occasionally. There is, of 
course, adequate regularity in passing from room to room or 
to the basement, but throughout the whole school there 
31

is a remarkable minimum of signals and routinized pro- 
cedure. 
Without going into the results achieved by these two 
schools, suffice it to point out that they represent the two 
extremes in school management. Hach school, to certain 
groups of school people, would be the ideal school. The 
oat at to how much of rule and regulation, of 
Tigi routine, shall obtain in-school has raged loud and 
long. Both the ‘‘idealists’’ and the ‘‘formalists’’ have 
searched psychology, ethics, sociology, business procedure, 
and even philosophy, for arguments. It is not our purpose 
to go into the details of this controversy. The weight of 
evidence seems to be clearly on the side of those who favor 
the routinizing of the fixed mechanical aspects and who 
stand for the intelligent application of the laws of habit 
formation to all but the variable factors in school pro- 
cedure. Smoothness and efficiency are gained and 
economy of time is effected. The initiative and originality 
of children is in no wise injured, nor need the exponents 
of democracy be alarmed if children are required to 
march into and out of rooms in regular and orderly man- 
ner in response to arbitrary signals. But injury and 
injustice will result if all children are expected to cover 
exactly the same amount of work in the same time, or if 
the teacher provides but one approach to a subject for 
all children. There is not so much danger of too much 
routine, as there is of the application of routine procedure 
to activities in which it is not desirable. 
The Mechanical Aspects of School Management.— What 
then are the more or less fixed factors in school manage- 
ment with which the teacher and supervisor will be con- 
cerned? Briefly, they seem to include the following: (1) 
the physical conditions; (2) the seating, passing, and 
marching of pupils; (3) keeping grades, records, and 
registers; (4) storing, distributing, and collecting ma-  
-P-A-G-E-53
  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 35 
terials and supplementary books; (5) discipline; (6) the 
daily programme; (7) preparation for the first day of 
school. 
1/ The Physical Conditions —These include temperature 
and ventilation, amount and direction of light, appearance 
and decorations of the room. 
(a) Temperature and ventilation. Survey reports cite 
instances of schoolrooms kept at temperatures of from 58 
degrees to 86 degrees. I recently visited a school building 
early in the morning before the teachers arrived and found 
the temperature in several rooms to be well over 90 degrees. 
Teachers told me that they were unable to get the tempera- 
ture down to normal by the time school began even by 
opening every window. 
In some places teachers are prohibited by rule from 
opening windows or doors or from otherwise inter- 
fering with the heating and ventilating system. Such 
systems are the cause of much complaint, because it seems 
impossible to discover in the janitorial genus the requisite 
amount of intelligence to adjust the amount of heat to the 
weather. If three cold days are followed by a warm one, 
the amount of heat turned into the school rooms will not 
vary a whit. Janitors, in epymmon with many other ap- 
parently intelligent individuals, seem unable to learn that 
a rainy day in winter is not colder but much warmer than 
a clear one. Such situations, however, do not excuse the 
teacher from attention to the conditions under which she 
and her class must work. She might keep a record of the 
temperature in her room, taken twice a day, and present 
it as evidence of bad conditions. She should appeal to 
the supervisor to bring as sharply as possible to the atten- 
tion of the administration defects in physical conditions 
that are beyond teacher control. 
In schools where the heat and ventilation are within the 
jurisdiction of the teacher, she should be checked up as to
-P-A-G-E-54
  34 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
her attention to window-boards, registers, radiators, doors, 
ete. It is very easy to become adapted to warm or close 
air, but both common-sense observation and experimental 
evidence point to the necessity of maintaining the proper 
temperature and humidity, together with a current of fresh 
air. The best temperature seems to be about 68 degrees. 
Humidity should be about 50 per cent and this factor 
can be easily measured by any one of several devices. The 
correction of insufficient humidity is somewhat difficult. 
The old device of a pan of water on the radiator is now 
said to be ineffective. A better device probably is to place 
a large pan over the register or near the wall grating, with 
either a desk blotter rolled into a cone or a towel used as 
a wick. 
(b) Lighting. Within recent years there has sprung up 
in the architectural field the school architect, specializing 
in school buildings. One of the chief problems of this 
expert is to arrange the building so that in most of the 
rooms certain requirements as to amount and direction 
ef light will be satisfied. This is a radical change from 
the days when schools were built with no particular 
thought as to such minutiae as the number and kind of 
windows, the relation of floor space to window space, the 
relation of coloring to lighting. Nowadays, most teachers 
are familiar with the demands in lighting: that the window 
space be approximately one-quarter the floor space, that 
the light preferably come from one direction, that, where 
possible, desks should be shifted so the children may receive 
the light from the left, ete. Some of these conditions, like 
those in heating and ventilation, are beyond the teacher’s 
control, due to the location of the room or the placing of 
the desks. However, she should be alert to such devices 
as will better conditions in any way, such as manipulating 
the shades, changing seats, etc. Both teacher and super- 
visor should note the possibilities involved in changing the
-P-A-G-E-55
  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 35 
arrangement of desks, painting the walls, surfacing the 
blackboards, darkening some of the windows, and urge 
such changes and improvements upon the administrative 
officer responsible. 
Teachers should avoid standing near a window or lean- 
ing on a window sill while listening to a class, because this 
forces the pupils to look squarely into the light. 
(c) Appearance of the room. It would seem that the 
general appearance of a room would depend largely upon 
the janitor. This is true, of course, but often rooms cared 
for by the same janitor will vary markedly in appearance 
and in the impression made upon the visitor. The differ- 
ence seems to be due to the varying ideals of neatness and 
habits of work manifested by the respective teachers. Some 
rooms always look ‘‘mussed up,’’ while others present the 
opposite appearance. A certain amount of displacement 
of books and materials is necessary and is an indication of 
healthy activity, and such a condition is not to be confused 
with the confusion and disorder due to lack of system. 
Children soon acquire the habits and ideals of a teacher 
and either aid in keeping the room clean or contribute 
to its general unkemptness. A legitimate function of super- 
vision is to aid a teacher whose room does not present 
a reasonably neat and orderly appearance. <A good system 
of monitorial help is a helpful device. This matter will 
be discussed again under the heading concerned with the 
handling of materials and supplementary books. 
Probably the best initial approach to such a problem is 
through the general teachers’ meetings, in which general 
remarks can be made without offense to any teacher. Ref- 
erence can be made to it in supervisory bulletins. The next 
step might be a series of tactful suggestions made to the 
particular individual who did not make application from 
the general discussions. Continued failure to attend to the 
matter must result in specific directions as to what to do,
-P-A-G-E-56
    36 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
when and how to do it, together with insistence that it be 
done. 
When caricaturists draw a schoolroom scene, there is 
always among the decorations a picture of George Wash- 
ington and one of Abraham Lincoln. Vaudeville artists 
often refer to pictures of ‘‘George’’ and ‘‘Abe’’ as the 
“‘props’’ of the schoolroom. ‘Though teachers are quick 
to resent such light treatment of famous men, they are 
themselves partially to blame for the condition. Schoolroom 
decorations, particularly the ancient chromos of famous 
men, have been fit subjects for the cartoonist and jokesmith. 
It is a sad commentary upon the teacher, supposed to be 
training the children in appreciation of the tasteful and 
the beautiful, that she herself has been sometimes so unob- 
servant of the effect of dull and drab surroundings. Many 
schoolrooms to-day are, of course, beautiful in harmonious 
tone and color, tastefully decorated with copies of the mas- 
‘terpieces and with excellent portraits of our famous men. 
But despite the many beautiful rooms, it is still possible 
for pupils to be promoted from a room decorated with 
eopies of Corot and Landseer to one adorned with rows 
»f£ smudged posteards or with crépe-paper streamers. 
Many teachers utilize the pupils’ art work for room 
decoration, and when properly used this is a good device. 
But in too many cases the drawings or paintings are poorly 
placed and are left in position too long for either decora- 
tive or pedagogical effect. Plants and flowers, in window 
boxes or inside the room, make pleasing decorations for the 
classroom, though care must be taken to avoid inartistic 
arrangements. 
The supervisor might borrow a hint from the schemes 
used in standardizing rural schools in many states, which 
provide for the purchase of one standard picture each year. 
Ideas on decoration, as well as magazines and pamphlets 
bearing on the topic, can be brought to the teacher’s at-

tention by meaxis of the supervisor’s mimeographed or 
printed bulletihs. 
2. The Séating, Passing, and Marching of Pupils—A 
grade building visited by a class in supervision had recently 
““peen. departmentalized in the upper grades. The passing 
of pupils from class to class was a riotous proceeding, the 
uproar continuing several minutes into each period. In 
some of the rooms there was open impertinence and dis- 
order. All the teachers blamed the departmental plan for 
the deterioriation of the school, but members of the super- 
vision class who were assigned the problem for quiet in- 
vestigation found that when the school had been changed 
from one plan to the other, no one had thought to provide 
a new system of signals and routine procedure to replace 
the old one. The blunder was clearly the principal’s; it 
probably is not a common one but it illustrates the im- 
portance of attention by supervisory officers to routine 
matters. A new plan of room registration, a new system 
of signals, the assignment of hall duty to teachers, together 
with an explanation of the situation to the pupils, quickly 
worked a change. Not only should the passing of pupils 
through the halls be standardized, but the manner of going 
to and from the blackboard, through the cloakrooms, etc., 
should be carefully routinized. The arrangement of fire 
drills affords a good opportunity for the codrdination of 
individual and group efforts. 
The opposite condition, of too much routine, too many 
and too minute signals, should be guarded against just as 
earefully as the situation outlined above. The teacher 
who has an elaborate and intricate set of signals with which 
to control every movement involved in putting away work, ~ 
getting wraps, turning, rising, and passing, is as much in 
need of supervisory help as is the teacher with no signals 
at all. Economy of time and efficiency of instruction is 
furthered by routinizing passing and marching, and many
-P-A-G-E-58

sources of disorder are thus eliminated. Dk most buildings 
such matters are worked out by the prindipal, and the 
teacher should be thoroughly familiar with the building 
regulations in order to codperate with them. Within the 
room each teacher should evolve her own system. \.--*— 
Poor work and bad posture are induced by improper 
seating, but teachers are often very careless about such 
matters. Where adjustable desks are provided, or where 
there are seats of different sizes, the teacher should be 
held responsible for seating all pupils to the best advan- 
tage. Where conditions are not within the control of. the 
teacher, both she and the supervisor should combine efforts 
to secure proper desks and seats. 
The supervisor can be of assistance also in the case of 
the beginning teacher who has not yet learned to separate 
certain children, or to so place a youngster who is a source 
of disorder that his efforts are circumvented. The taking 
of roll and checking up on absences can also be made easier 
rough proper seating. 
3. Keeping Grades, Records, and Registers—The grad- 
ing of pupils, both for daily recitations and for tests, pre- 
sents some difficult problems which are often overlooked by 
the teacher. Usually, of course, the grading system in any 
school has been fixed by regulation and has been in use 
for some time, so that the supervisor’s chief duty in this 
respect will be to see that the proper marks are used and 
to explain the system to new teachers) Such systems will 
vary widely. Some require daily grades for each pupil 
in each subject, weekly tests, and monthly summaries, to- 
gether with estimates upon ten or a dozen attitudes such 
as application, courtesy, perseverance, ete. Others are 
satisfied with a weekly grade and monthly summaries of 
each subject, with probably a grade for. deportment and 
records of tardiness and absence. 
However, grading is far from perfect, and there is a lit-
-P-A-G-E-59
     
  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 39 
| 
erature of goodly size on the topic, with which the super- 
visor should be familiar in order that intelligent changes 
may be advocated. Wherever the teacher is free to grade 
as she wishes, she may well consult the supervisor. It is 
almost impossible to make definite pronouncements, though 
a few may be risked. | Unless a daily grade is prescribed, 
it is probably better to grade once a week, summarizing 
on the monthly report card. The grading of papers, how- 
ever, cannot be settled so easily. Studies of the subject 
show that there is the utmost variation in weighting ques- 
tions and in grading the answers. In general, the teacher 
should evaluate each question in relation to the content 
involved and in, relation to the other questions in the list. 
» Almost never should the old practice of valuing each ques- 
tion at ten be utilized. When the questions have been 
evaluated and the points totaled, values for ‘‘A,’’ ‘‘B,’’ 
ete., or for 75, 80, ete., can be worked out. The total number 
of points made by a pupil is then located in the scale and 
the paper graded ‘‘B”’ or 85 per cent, as the case may be. 
Or, the papers may be read and placed in four or five 
piles on the basis of the teacher’s judgment. Those in the 
best group are then read and given a grade, such as ‘‘A”’ 
or 90 per cent. The other groups are then evaluated in 
terms of the best set. Those in the best set are not neces- 
sarily ‘‘A’’ papers and may be assigned a lower value in 
some cases. 
The old method of grading, using each point in the 100 
per cent scale, is almost useless and is open to numerous 
criticisms. Even the children are keen enough to see that 
there can be no real difference between 86 and 87, and 
very little between 81 and 86. Teachers who use this 
system plus a decimal are reducing grading to the utterly 
ridiculous. (Experimental data show that the best grading 
plan involves five points, four for passing students and 
one for failures. The marks may be either, ‘‘A,’’ ‘‘B,”’   
-P-A-G-E-60
  FS RONEN ee em ee 
40 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
60,22 De §¢iR}?? or “<Bxcellent,’? “*@ood,”’ ‘Fair,”? 
‘*Poor,’’ and ‘‘Unsatisfactory,’’ or any other such classifi- 
cation. Not only are such, grades better in theory, but 
they save considerable time.) 
There seems to be no use whatever to attempt to get 
agreement among a group of teachers as to the value of 
any one grade or unit in the seale. In addition to the im- 
possibility of arriving at such agreement, grading is sub- 
ject to variation due to all manner and kind of outside 
influence. The weather, the state of the teacher’s health, 
the conduct of the pupil, the appearance of the pupil, his 
social status, the teacher’s whims and prejudices, all enter 
into a grade. Furthermore, a teacher is often’ entirely 
ignorant of a pupil’s school history and home conditions. 
The distribution of grades in any large unselected group 
will be roughly 3 per cent ‘‘A,’’ 22 per cent ‘‘B,’’ 50 per 
cent ‘‘O,’’ 22 per cent ‘‘D,’’ and 3 per cent ‘‘E.’? In 
small classes and in selected groups the distribution will 
vary from the normal above. Whenever marked varia- 
tion is found, the supervisor should investigate to see if 
the teacher is grading too severely or too leniently, or if 
there is present a legitimate reason for the variation. A 
large foreign element in ‘a room, a large group from a poor 
district or a large number from a very good section, many 
retarded children, are all factors that will disturb the 
normal frequency of grades. 
Beginning teachers may have trouble filling in all the 
grades and marks called for and in keeping the room reg- 
ister correctly, but such difficulties are easily corrected. 
4. Storing, Distributing, and Collecting Materials, Sup- 
plies, Supplementary Books, etc—In a room recently 
visited an observer reported that the supplementary 
readers appeared as if by magic and that she was not at 
first aware of where they came from and how. Everyone 
has seen the contrasting condition, in which the passing of
-P-A-G-E-61
  
  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT @ 41 
books or materials is a period of noise, confusion, and in- 
cipient disorder. In many cases an altogether dispropor- 
tionate amount of time is used. The supervisor should aid 
in devising monitorial systems, and should demonstrate 
some of the many things that may be done to retain atten- 
tion while the monitors are distributing supplies. 
Many schools are not equipped with rooms or elosets for 
storing books, ink, chalk, drawing supplies, ete., but even 
where they are, some teachers seem unable to find needed 
materials quickly. Others keep the storeroom in such order 
that anyone may be sent to locate what is wanted. Need- 
less to say, both time and effort are saved and habits of neat- 
ness and order are inculeated by keeping the material 
room in good order. There are a few teachers who need 
to be cautioned because they confuse a fussy primness with 
orderliness. 
3) 5. Disvipve,.Cuhciee seem to be three factors in the 
maintenance of good order, namely, the administration of 
the routine elements in school management, the personality @~ 
and teaching skill of the teacher, and, lastly, the adminis- 
tration, of rules and regulations relating directly to be- 
havior. 
Obviously, a thoroughly routinized procedure in regard 
to passing and marching and the distribution of supplies 
will eliminate chances for disorder. Proper regulation of 
the heat, light, and ventilation also contributes to good 
order. Many cases of bad behavior are not due to any- 
thing very seriously bad in the children, but to the loop- 
holes allowed in a poor system for the explosion of excess 
energy and for the exercise of otherwise commendable 
ingenuity. This is one of the first places for the supervisor 
to look for the underlying causes of disorder. 
(Probably the most important of the three factors is the 
personality and teaching skill of the teacher.) These two 
things might well be discussed separately, but since they - 
—
-P-A-G-E-62
  42 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
are so closely interrelated they are here placed together. 
‘When the supervisor finds a teacher who is constantly using 
formal means to secure order, one who is constantly tap- 
ping with her pencil or calling on pupils to ‘‘pay atten- 
tion,’’ ete., the task is usually the improvement of teaching 
skill and not one in the enforcement of rules and regula- 
tions. Here the supervisor should probably give a friendly 
discussion on child psychology, upon instinctive appeals 
that beget attention, upon traits of children prominent 
at one age or another, etc. Many earnest, conscientious 
teachers whose organization of subject matter is fair fail 
miserably because of their complete ignorance regarding 
the nature of the child being taught. Normal-school and 
college classes in psychology are too often somewhat formal 
and the applications to real situations are not made promi- 
nent. Reading-circle work and discussion groups under 
the leadership of a practical psychologist will help, and 
the supervisor must in some measure be the practical 
psychologist. 
The effect of the teacher’s personality upon the order 
of the room is too obvious to need extended discussion. 
Even among adults some people ‘‘rub us the wrong way’? 
and bring the desire to do something contrary. On the 
other hand there is the colleague or leader with whom it 
is a pleasure to work and whose personality inspires to real 
effort. Such reactions are more intense and more open 
in children because they have developed less inhibition 
of what they really feel and think. The observation of 
the two types of individuals gives a clue as to the personal 
characteristics that are to be avoided and those that are 
to be cultivated.+ ( The improvement of the teacher’s per-” 
sonality will present some difficult problems to the super- 
  
  
1See Chapter XV for a further discussion of the teacher’s per- 
sonality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
    
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 43 
visor, because most teachers are at an age when their 
personal habits and reactions are more or less fixed. Ef- 
forts to change them are almost without avail except with 
younger teachers, though there are some instances cited 
in which remarkable changes have been wrought. Again 
we may follow the formula of attacking the problem first 
by means of general discussion in teachers’ meeting, fol- 
lowing this by tactful demonstrations of the proper atti- 
tude, and as a last resort giving the teacher specific 
correction in regard to her mistakes. In these intimate 
matters of personality it is probable that the general dis- 
cussions will rarely have an effect, because it seems to be a 
universal human trait that directions so given are never 
applied by the persons toward whom they are directed. 
‘Another device worthy of trial is transferring the teacher 
from one grade to another, or from one building to another, 
since such changes often alter certain outside factors which 
have been irritating the teacher and causing the unpleas- 
ant personal reactions. Failing any sign of adaptability 
in a teacher, shé should be eliminated from the system. 
To digress for a moment, this matter of eliminating or 
dismissing a teacher is one that must be handled with the 
utmost fairness and justice. Every possible device should 
be tried first and the judgments of two or more super- 
visory officers taken into account.? 
The last factor in maintaining good order, the enforce- « 
ment of rules, has been until recent times the most promi- 
nent. This has probably been due to the old autocratic 
habits of thought and also to the almost complete ignorance 
of child psychology. There can be no doubt that a too 
elaborate set of rules relating to all matters of behavior 
is worse than useless. No one can remember them and: 
many pupils are guilty of breaking rules they did not know 
? This problem will be discussed again in Chapter XV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
    fq 
44 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
existed. Furthermore, the matter of flexibility must be 
considered. There are times when it is much better and 
wiser not to enforce a rule. The best policy seems to be 
to have a few broad rules that are thoroughly understood 
and so constructed as to admit of flexible administration. 
This last factor will not, as some formalists fear, engender 
a lack of respect for law, but it will rather make for in- 
telligent appreciation of the principle of individual differ- 
ences and for good thinking in the matter of considering 
all elements in any situation. When correction or punish- 
ment is necessary and everyone understands that it is, 
then it should follow as swiftly and surely as circumstances 
will permit. In the mind of the pupil the punishment 
should be connected clearly and distinctly with the offense 
and be in keeping with the gravity of it. A teacher was 
recently cited as having forced children who had used bad 
language to hold red pepper in their mouths, but such 
unusual punishments are practically unknown in most 
places. Keeping pupils in at recess or after school is to 
be frowned upon, likewise forcing them to stand at atten- 
tion or to remain silent or idle. Punishment should not be 
inflicted unless the teacher is practically certain of the 
pupil’s guilt, and it is not wise to punish a whole class 
for the offense of one individual. As far as possible, the 
teacher’s whims, religious or racial prejudices, regard for 
social status, etc., must be left out of disciplinary cases. 
Many teachers are still unaware that children slightly 
deficient mentally or physically are to be regarded differ- 
ently from their normal classmates. Practically no teacher 
makes the blunder of treating a cripple or a low-grade 
moron as she would a normal child, and this same principle 
must be applied to those who are more nearly normal. Hye 
strain, defective hearing, adenoids, very slight mental de- 
ficiency, are all common causes of bad behavior, and ob- 
viously such cases should not be treated under the rules
-P-A-G-E-65
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 45 
  laid down for normal children. The supervisor during his 
observations and tests should be on the alert for such cases 
and should advise the teacher concerning them, so that they 
will not be made to suffer an injustice. 
In the actual administering of punishment we are again 
concerned with that vitally conditioning factor, the 
teacher’s personality. All through the work of a teacher 
there should be manifested a friendly firmness and de- 
cision, and in disciplinary cases she should be as impartial 
and objective as she can. As nearly as it is humanly pos- 
sible, anger and passion should be eliminated. Correction 
and punishment should be a social matter wherever it 
ean be made so, and every precaution should be taken to 
prevent the pupil from feeling that there is a personal clash. 
While discussing the maintenance of order it is to be 
remembered that a room can be ‘‘disciplined to death’’ 
in some cases, and such a condition is little better than too 
much disorder. 
Finally, it should be emphasized that the supervisor 
should judge the whole disciplinary procedure in the light 
of this principle: Is the sum total of the teacher’s efforts 
constructive and directed toward the formation of habits 
of good behavior, courtesy, and intelligent obedience? 
6. The Daily Programme.—The making of the daily pro- 
gramme was, and still is, with many teachers a matter of 
whim, personal preference, or convenience. However, there 
is a vast amount of experimental data available from which 
guidance may be obtained, and which is well summarized 
in the following statements from Sears :* 
1. That the day’s work should open with some brief but in- 
teresting and stimulating exercise which requires little mental 
exertion. 
2. That the first lessons should be perhaps reading and spelling, 
that is, the simplest of the formal subjects.   
#J. B. Sears, Classroom Organization and Control, Boston, 1918,
-P-A-G-E-66
46 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
3. That the next should likely be arithmetic, the most difficult 
of the formal studies. 
4. That recreation should follow immediately, or at least soon 
after arithmetic. 
5. That the periods immediately following the morning recess 
should be given to arithmetic or grammar. 
6, That writing should precede rather than follow a recreation 
period. 
7. That the most diffieult of the remaining studies, say grammar 
or history, should come between noon and the second recess. 
8. That such studies as nature study, manual training, domestic 
Science, etc., should be placed later in the afternoon. 
  The supervisor should be familiar with some of the studies 
upon which the foregoing conclusions are based because 
there is some difference of opinion on some of the details. 
Where there is more than one section or class in a room, 
obviously some of the recitations must come at inopportune 
times. While this is inevitable, effort should be made to 
construct a programme as nearly in accord with good 
theory as possible. 
The programme should be typed or written on a ‘card 
and posted, preferably on the outside of the door and 
also in some convenient place within the room. The teacher 
should then follow the programme unless there is some 
unusual disturbance. Supervisors and other visitors should 
consult the programme on the door and try to enter and 
deave rooms at the times scheduled for class changes. In 
passing let it be said that there seems to be no reason why 
a supervisor, regular or special, should disrupt a room or 
building schedule with his visits. This practice is a source 
of considerable hard feeling on the part of teachers and 
rightly so. On the other hand, a teacher should not change 
her programme in order to avoid certain lessons during 
a supervisor’s visit.* 
  
*These features will be dealt with at length in Chapter XVII.

  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 47 
7. Preparation for the First Day of School_—The amount 
of time devoted to preparation for the opening of school 
shows a most interesting variation. Many young teachers 
who lay awake planning their first opening day can 
scarcely be induced to think of it after three or four years 
of service. The waste of time at the opening of most 
schools and the bad impression made upon the children 
are almost immeasureable. The abuse has grown so that 
many school boards date contracts ahead of the opening 
of school and require the teacher’s presence in advance. 
Teachers’ meetings are held in many places from one to 
three days in advance of the opening day. There is no 
reason why the first day in most schools should not be a 
regular school day. The teacher should be familiar with 
her room, its location in relation to the passing of lines, 
with the signal system, with the heating and ventilating 
apparatus even if it is a mechanical system beyond her 
control. While schoolroom supplies are usually placed by 
the janitor, the teacher should see that they are placed 
and ready. Wherever possible the register from last year 
should be studied and an effort made to be somewhat fa- 
miliar with the make-up of the prospective class. She 
should have her own register, book lists, record blanks, 
ete., ready and arranged. While these matters may seem 
trivial to some, the facts are that an enormous amount of 
time is wasted and the most stupid blunders are made. 
There is no excuse whatever for negligence or inefficiency 
here, and the supervisor or principal should check up as 
closely as possible between the teachers’ meeting and the 
opening day, as well as upon that day. 
In addition to the foregoing formal details there should 
also be a tentative programme arranged and work pro- 
vided. It is an easy matter to arrange exercises for the 
different subjects that will serve as an introduction, will 
give the teacher an indication of the nature of her class, 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
    48 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
and above all will indicate to the children that the school 
jis a businesslike institution which starts work with the first 
bell. Of course, many things may happen in a first day 
jn the way of interruptions, but apart from such accidents 
the first day should be a day of regular work. 
The supervisor or principal should call a meeting dur- 
ing the week preceding the opening, and instruct the 
teachers in regard to all routine matters and indicate what 
will be done. The supervisor should be careful, however, 
not to waste an hour on matters already familiar to his 
group, as this is one of the chief sore points with teachers 
and creates a bad impression at the start. 
SuMMaRY FOR THE SUPERVISOR \ 
Below will be found a blank or outline for the super- 
visor’s use in assisting teachers with the points discussed 
in this chapter. Each chapter relating to supervisory 
activity will have such a summary. It is to be emphasized 
here that these summaries are not to be regarded as com- 
plete or final, but as suggestive, and they should be 
adapted to the needs of any particular situation. Some 
of them will be in the nature of scorecards or rating 
blanks, while others will contain a series of questions which 
are not to be scored individually but which will guide the 
supervisor in observing a teaching process. Hither type 
will be found very good as bases for conference with the 
teacher. When extended discussion is not necessary, they 
may be checked and handed to the teacher or filed. 
Whatever use is made of them, they should be open to the 
inspection of the teacher, and any question she may have 
should be answered fully and cheerfully. 
Supervisors will probably find it an advantage to ‘ee 
these outlines, or ones like them, printed or mimeographed. 
Classes in supervision should be supplied with them and 
given much practice in applying them.

        CHAPTER IV 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES AFFECTING THE LEARNING PROCESS 
Before taking up the more specialized types of teaching, 
we will examine a number of factors operative to a greater 
or less degree in all the types. These factors are apper- 
ception, motive, self-activity, and individual difference. 
The technique of questioning will also be discussed in this 
connection. 
APPERCEPTION 
This psychological principle states, in brief, that the 
learner’s understanding of anything new depends upon 
his past experience in general, and upon that particular 
phase of his past experience that is uppermost at the time. 
The emotional attitude of the mind as well as the ideas 
present will affect the interpretation of the new. 
Good illustrations of the working of this principle 
are to be seen in the so-called ‘‘funny answers’’ of chil- 
dren, in their seemingly peculiar viewpoints, and in the 
well known ‘‘schoolboy howlers.’’ A youngster in the 
lower grades, usually perfect in number work, was unable 
to work the following problem: ‘‘If each schooner is given 
three masts, how many of them could be fitted out by a 
shipyard that has 4,698 masts on hand?’’ His teacher was 
at a loss to understand his inability to solve such a simple 
example until he made the remark, ‘‘I can’t work this, 
because schooners don’t have three masts.’? In some 
unknown manner he had learned that the real schooner is 
a boat with only two masts, and the idea was so strong

    54 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
with him that it prevented his working a simple arith- 
metical process which obviously did not depend on the idea 
at all. 
A group of tenement children from New York’s East 
Side were much interested in a fairy story that contained 
a vivid description of a witch. They hung upon every 
word as the story-teller described the wrinkled old woman, 
with hooked nose and sharp chin, bright eyes, yellow 
teeth, gray hair, and long black cape. Excitement grew 
as each item was added, and when it was related that the 
witch smoked a pipe and was very mean to little boys and 
girls, the group burst forth, ‘‘We know one of dem dere 
witches, she lives over by de Williamsboig Bridge.’* 
An eighth-grade class failed the question, ‘“How many 
books have you read during this semester?’’ because their 
teacher had always used the word ‘‘term,’’ instead of 
“semester.” 
A girl who had recently come from a rural school, after 
reading how the Colonial troops hurried to Concord and 
Lexington to capture the military stores there, asked why 
they should wish to capture a ‘‘lot of hat stores.’? Ques- 
tions brought out the fact that she had never met the word 
“‘military’’ before and now supposed it to be the word 
“millinery,’’ which she had heard many times. 
It might be said in passing that college students are not 
beyond the stage where the teacher can safely disregard 
the implications of the principle of apperception. A col- 
lege senior used in his paper the expression, ‘‘first 
straight’’ in place of ‘‘first rate,’? meaning very good. 
Asked what he meant, he explained that he had always 
used the expression because he had heard others do it, but 
that he had never quite understood why it fitted the situa- 
tion. Another junior student wrote on his paper that he 
had only a ‘‘half-hazzard’”’ idea of what the questions 
called for. There is no question that he was right.
-P-A-G-E-75
THE LEARNING PROCESS 55 
These examples show how vital it is that teachers know 
the approximate limits of the pupil’s*vocabulary and store 
of information. In all teaching the past experience of the 
learner is a vital factor. Care should be taken to 
see that all words used in class are understood. Dif- 
ficult words that will be met in the advance assignment 
should be explained and illustrated. In addition to the 
minor applications of this principle to single words and 
phrases, there is the more important application to the 
assignment of a large topic. The more ground to be cov- 
ered, the more ideas to be met, the more complicated the 
thinking to be done, the more careful the teacher must be 
in preparing the class for the coming work. 
If the teacher finds that some of the pupils do not have 
some pieces of information that are essential to the under- 
standing of the lesson to come, she should endeavor to 
supply them as effectively as possible. Many teachers 
have an almost uncanny knowledge of what. goes on in a 
youngster’s mind and ean direct their teaching most ac- 
eurately in consequence. On the other hand, many earn- 
est, conscientious teachers are handicapped because of 
inability to determine what children are concerned with, 
or because of failure to appreciate the significance of 
apperception. Some teachers who realize the value of the 
principle are slow to see concrete applications, as the fol- 
lowing instance shows. <A primary teacher discussing the 
Eskimos was having difficulty in explaining that in the far 
north the water is not entirely covered with ice, but that 
where the water flows or moves there will be found open 
lanes or ‘‘leads.’’? How such a condition could be, with 
ice all around, was beyond the comprehension of the class 
until a ragged youngster finally discovered what the 
teacher was driving at; and said: ‘‘Why you can see that 
in the ditch at the corner; there is a lot of ice over the 
water at the sides but out in the middle it’s running 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
    56 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
water.’’ The teacher had crossed that ditch four times a 
day without realizing that it was not merely a ditch but 
a piece of teaching material as well. : 
The same difficulty is manifested in the teacher’s dis- 
regard of children’s ‘‘funny sayings.’’ These sometimes 
afford the very best clues to the pupil’s ideas and thought 
processes. 
The supervisor’s assistance will be along the lines of 
discussing the general principles of child psychology, of 
referring the teacher to studies on the content of chil- 
dren’s minds, and in pointing out specific things in the 
pupil’s environment or outside activity that can be turned 
to schoolroom use. Those teachers who continue to regard 
children’s ideas and viewpoints as peculiar, and who are 
unable to realize that their information differs materially 
from that of the oq It, will always have trouble with 
teaching. | 
The supervisor should also have his teachers on the 
alert to see from the children’s expressions and answers 
that words beyond their comprehension are being used. 
A fifth-grade teacher was surprised at the difficulty her 
geography class had in answering an apparently easy 
question, until a little girl spoke up: ‘‘Us kids don’t know 
what those two big words mean!’’ In this case the chil- 
dren had no chance to get the meaning and had to say so. 
The opposite situation is just as dangerous, in which the 
words are used correctly without any understanding of 
the meaning. Pupils will often manifest an astonishing 
ability to use words and phrases and to make combina~ 
tions the meaning of which has never entered their heads. 
The teacher must guard against this especially while she 
is presenting new words to a class. It is difficult to de- 
velop the ability to throw out check questions with which 
to break up such a situation, but the supervisor can be of 
help in noting such situations, overlooked by the hurried  
-P-A-G-E-77
a ae 
THE LEARNING PROCESS 57 
teacher, and in discussing them afterwards. It is easy to 
see such things from the supervisor’s detached position, 
and the teacher should not feel that such criticisms are 
of great weight with the critic. They are merely devices 
to aid her in developing the ability to detect such situa- 
tions while on her feet before the class. 
The principle of apperception should be borne in mind 
when reading textbooks designed for grade classes. 
Motive 
Interest and Attention.—No argument is necessary to 
support the contention that learning takes place best under 
conditions of clear, undivided attention. The forced and 
divided attention that is given in response to a demand 
from the teacher, tapping on the table, fear of punishment, 
etc., is not effective for learning. 
The words ‘‘interest’’ and ‘‘attention’’ are used inter- 
ehangeably by many teachers, and with others there is 
confusion as to which of the two comes first. (i Spontaneous) 
attention and interest are two names for practically the 
same thing. The things we are interested in are those that 
attract our spontaneous attention. (Voluntary attention, 
however, precedes interest, instead of following it as pop- 
ularly believed. We attend voluntarily to things long 
enough to discover they are of use to us or otherwise 
vitally concern us, ‘and then we become interested. If they 
do not concern us, we shall not develop much interest. 
After interest has been developed in anything through 
attention, it is proper to say we are interested in it, not 
forgetting that attention preceded. 
The teacher’s problem is to get attention, either that 
kind which is equivalent to interest, as explained above, or 
such a degree of voluntary attention that interest will 
develop. Violent discussions have raged in the academie
-P-A-G-E-78
58 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
world regarding the legitimacy of different methods of 
securing interest. At one end of the scale is the head- 
master who recommends a certain type of classical private 
school because in ay schools there is no ‘‘toadying to 
interest, no pampering of the learner, who is assigned 
definite, dull, distasteful tasks in order that he may de- 
velop mental and moral fiber.’? A good answer to the 
doctrine of difficulty in education is found in Hall-Quest: + 
  One hears it frequently said . . . that the pupil must rely upon 
himself. Grappling with a problem until eventually he solves 
it, gives the pupil confidence and ambition. “It makes him 
think.” It happens only too frequently that travelers in a new 
country lose their way. They know many things about traveling. 
By tedious, arduous, discouraging, and perhaps injurious attempts 
they eventually may find familiar paths and havens. Doubtless 
they did considerable thinking, and their satisfaction upon at: last 
finding the right way was, of course, a natural state of feeling. 
But would it not have been better never to have lost the path? 
If the pupil’s power to think depends on tedious, prolonged, and 
all too frequently unsuccessful effort, then it is small wonder that 
so few high-school pupils think—nay more—it is the possible 
explanation of the dearth of thinking among the masses. The 
doctrine of difficulty has its martyr-host as numerous and pathetic 
as the victims of untested opinion and ideas in religion and gov- 
ernment. The learning process is difficult enough without putting 
a special premium on difficulties. 
Advocates of the strenuous life in education at times seem to 
ignore the fact that effort for its own sake is sheer waste. Effort 
is a means, not an end. The automobile stalled in a mudhole will 
grumble and roar and pull. There is effort a-plenty and there 
is a waste of “gas,” tires, nerves, time, and good disposition as 
well. But direct this effort by chains, boards, or special devices 
for overcoming such mishaps, and effort proves successful. 
Hall-Quest is speaking principally of the difficulty of 
the undirected study process but his remarks apply 
1A. L. Hall-Quest, Supervised Study, New York, 1916,
-P-A-G-E-79
THE, LEARNING PROCESS 59 
equally well to interest. His remarks are opinion, of 
course, but the opinion is based upon sound psycholog- 
ical theory and is supported in considerable measure 
by statistical data derived from supervised-study experi- 
ments. 
We need fear no weakening effects upon the children 
merely because work is made interesting, and furthermore 
it is to be pointed out to the advocates of difficulty that 
difficulty and interest often go together. Both children 
and adults engage in most difficult tasks calling forth 
every energy and resource and are at the same time 
intensely interested. The very efficacy of difficulty, if 
there be such, will be enhanced because of the clear atten- 
tion resulting from interest. There is far more danger 
of children’s acquiring a distaste for thinking and work- 
ing because of the lack of interesting opportunities for 
expression than because of such opportunities. 
At the other end of the scale is the half-trained peda- 
gogue who believes that the pupil should do nothing in 
which he is not interested, typified by the institute speaker 
who made the ill-chosen remark that ‘‘any method of 
securing interest, even a dog fight, is legitimate.’’ This 
idea of interest is just as incorrect and dangerous as is the 
one set forth above. 
Parker, in his texts on method, takes the bull by the 
horns and sets forth logically and emphatically that the 
so-called ‘‘sugar-coating’’ to secure interest is not a 
namby-pamby procedure as many think, but, properly 
applied, is a coldly scientific efficiency measure.? Such 
sugar-coating directs the undivided attention just where 
it is wanted, upon the material to be learned. No one is 
more fully aware than Parker, however, of the abuses 
2See 8. C. Parker, General Methods of Teaching in Elementary 
Schools, New York, 1919, pp. 205-208. See the same author’s book 
on high-school methods, pp. 337-340,

that have lead to widespread criticism. He cites the case 
of the children who became so interested in the fireworks 
and squirting water incident to a demonstration of vol- 
canoes and geysers that they no longer cared for the 
prosaic bays, maps, capes, and mountain ranges. Interest- 
getting devices should emphasize clearly and distinctly 
the nature of the thing to be learned and should not par- 
take of the nature of vaudeville. 
It must be noted that at the present writing there are 
more and more articles appearing in the periodical liter- 
ature that demand better training in accuracy, thorough- 
ness, perseverance, obedience, industry, ete., etc. Many 
of these pleas come from leading men in the field of edu- 
cation who make no apology for referring to ‘‘old- 
fashioned virtues.’? Some of them blame the trend of the 
times for the disappearance, or supposed disappearance, 
of these characteristics of the individual, but others blame 
the doctrine of interest. They feel that coddling a pupil, 
or ‘‘jollying him into doing his work,’’ as one of them puts 
it, is detrimental. These articles serve to emphasize the 
caution expressed above that application of the doctrine 
of interest must be made with extreme care. Properly 
applied, its friends believe that it will beget the very 
virtues that its enemies feel it destroys. There can be no 
question that there is need for attention to some of the 
‘‘old-fashioned virtues’’ at the present. 
Sources of Interest: Instincts—The chief source of the 
spontaneous attention which is so beneficial for learning is 
in the instinctive interests possessed by all normal human 
beings. Parker in his discussion of this topic, which 
should be read by all teachers and supervisors, proposes 
the following classification of instinctive interests, based 
upon Thorndike’s analysis of human instincts; he has 
departed from Thorndike’s more technical terminology in 
order to be more clearly understood by the beginning 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
THE LEARNING PROCESS 61 
teacher and the teacher unacquainted with more advanced 
discussions in psychology :* 
1. Interest in adventure and romance. 
2. Interest in actions of people and animals. 
3. Desire for social approval. 
4. Interest in rhythm, rhyme, jingle, and song. 
5. Curiosity, wonder, puzzle interest, problem interest, mental 
activity. 
6. Interest in expression and communication. 
7. Manipulation and general physical activity. 
8. Collecting instinct. 
9. Imitative play. 
10. Interest in games.* 
He advises against the use of the instinctive fear of 
physical pain, of fear of sarcasm or ridicule. Emulation 
must be used very carefully, as it is susceptible to wrong 
focus by the learner, though in some cases it may be used 
to advantage. 
The experienced supervisor can be of material assistance 
to beginning teachers and to older teachers who are not 
adept at seeing applications of these instinctive sources 
of interest. He should be constantly on the alert during 
his visits for examples of skillful use, complimenting the 
teacher concerned and passing the illustration on to 
others. 
Examples.—tThe interest in adventure and excitement is 
shown in the request of a lower-grade pupil at the library 
for a book ‘‘full of blunder and thunder.’’ The teacher 
ean find an unlimited number of books and stories that 
will provide an outlet for this natural interest and that will, 
in addition, give much practice in silent reading, even 
though they are not quite so full of ‘‘blood and thunder”’ 
as they might sound. : 
  
38. C. Parker, General Methods of Teaching in Elementary Schools, 
p. 214, 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  62 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
The interest in rhythm and jingle as well as the interest 
in games can be combined and utilized in dozens of drill 
devices, in learning phonics, words, tables, combinations, 
ete. 
The problematic aim, so important in good teaching, is 
based in some measure on the pupil’s puzzle interest and 
desire for mental activity. It should be noted in passing 
that the psychological reasons back of the problematic aim 
are equaled if not outweighed by. the sociological. 
The interest in construction finds a ready outlet in 
making farms, towns, mountain ranges, castles, ete., on 
the sand table; in constructing miniature villages, weav- 
ing, making doll dresses, or cutting out illustrations for 
stories. The construction of scenery and costumes for 
dramatizations in the upper grades utilizes interest in 
play and social approval as well as in construction. 
Here and there is an application to discipline as well as 
to the learning process. Definite construction problems 
given to the lad with the jackknife will keep him from 
exercising his desire for motor activity in destructive and 
annoying ways. The youth who rolls his eyes, wiggles 
his ears, and creates an uproar by appearing in a battered 
derby hat can be made an ally and an exponent of good 
order if his talents are utilized in dramatization. A third- 
grade ‘boy, who was a constant source of turmoil in the 
room, became so interested in dramatics that he asked 
permission to go to the basement to practice roaring for 
his part as a lion in ‘‘Daniel in the Lion’s Den.’’ The 
request was made in all seriousness and earried out con- 
scientiously. Many teachers might have blundered seri- 
ously in ridiculing such a request or in regarding it sus- 
piciously. In the same school the behavior of a number 
of intermediate-grade boys was greatly improved because 
of the fact that no one who manifested a cowardly or 
bullying attitude upon the playground was permitted to 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
THE LEARNING PROCESS 63 
play the part of Robin Hood in a series of little plays 
being given. 
Many teachers make the mistake of repressing and 
over-riding such interests as do appear instead of turning 
them to account. In discussing apperception it was 
pointed out that many of the so-called ‘‘funny answers’’ 
are really clues for the teacher and the same is true of 
some of the seemingly odd reactions among students. 
The instance is cited of the high-school principal who was 
in despair over the behavior of the ninth-grade boys. 
Control seemed about to be lost because there seemed to 
be no appeal that would have any effect. One morning, 
however, several of the boys appeared at the office and 
asked if a mirror could be placed in the boy’s basement; 
they wished to comb their hair and ‘‘slick up.’’ The 
mirror was placed as quickly as possible with inward 
rejoicings on the part of the harassed principal. His 
skillful use of appeals based upon social approval there- 
after proved more and more effective in winning these 
boys back to loyalty and good behavior. It may be em- 
barrassing in certain situations to have the young gallants 
paying attention and devotion to the young ladies of the 
class, but the wise teacher will recognize that here are 
manifestations of an instinctive interest that can be 
turned to pedagogical ends. 
The Selection of Instincts to be Used.—In addition to 
discussing opportunities for using these instinctive inter- 
ests, the supervisor should guide the teacher in the selection 
of the proper ones in any situation. They vary somewhat 
with age and between individuals. Nothing is more unfor- 
tunate than the attempt of an upper-grade teacher to utilize 
interests that have been outgrown, unless it is the im- 
patience of a lower-grade teacher trying to appeal to an 
interest not yet developed. The teacher must make sure 
that the interest being appealed to is active with a majority
-P-A-G-E-84
  64 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
of the class. She should also be sure that there are no bad 
effects to be aroused together with the desirable ones. Some 
uses of emulation, for instance, while beneficial for learning, 
are likely to engender selfishness and bad feeling and to 
cause much embarrassment. 
The Worth of the Subject Matter as a Source of Motive. 
—Many educators condemn absolutely such use of in- 
stinctive interests to secure motive as outlined above. 
Others place it secondary to stressing the intrinsic worth 
of the subject matter. Many teachers who happen to be 
popular with their pupils cite the fact that the class does 
exceptionally well when brought to a realization of the 
need and worth of the subject matter itself, but such 
teachers often overlook the fact that a large factor in the 
situation is the children’s intense desire to do well in 
order to please the teacher or otherwise gain social ap- 
proval. This element is difficult to estimate and is prob- 
ably overlooked even in experimental studies. There can 
be no question whatever that the realization of the need 
and worth of certain subject matter is a powerful and 
excellent source of motive, and ideally perhaps it should 
be the principal if not the only source. On the other hand 
it is a pure waste of time to decry the use of instinctive 
interests that function vitally in this capacity all through 
life. 
Se.F-Activity 
A baby learns to walk by actually trying to walk. No 
amount of demonstration or discussion will enable him to do 
it. He must do it himself in order to learn. This is a 
simple proposition, applying to mental activity as well as 
motor, and many teachers would think a supervisor mildly 
insane if he stated that they, the teachers, did not assent 
to it. But what does a teacher believe who constantly calls
-P-A-G-E-85
THE LEARNING PROCESS 65 
upon her pupils to ‘‘think,’’ sets the materials before them, 
and then does the thinking herself? What does a teacher 
believe who arbitrarily discourages and disregards inde- 
pendent questioning and discussion in her classes? She 
must believe that the pupils are going to learn to think by 
some telepathic transference from her own mind, some 
hocus pocus or other magic. She evidently does not believe 
that they will need to think themselves in order to learn 
to do it well. 
The principle of self-activity, or the idea that the learner 
learns by doing, whether it is motor or mental activity, is 
a primary principle of teaching and yet is disregarded in a 
tremendous amount of school work. In addition, participa- 
tion in doing adds mightily to interest. Many a hard work- 
ing teacher is puzzled and sometimes hurt by the lack of 
interest in the class and by the evident lack of progress, not 
realizing that by doing all the work herself she gives them 
no chance to progress. 
Motor Learning.—In the case of learning involving 
objective manipulation and bodily activity, the principle 
would seem to be more obvious than in the case of reflect- 
ive thinking. Nevertheless, violations are fairly common. 
The active, quick moving teacher is apt to take a piece 
of paper-cutting out of the child’s hand to demonstrate 
and proceed to do a large share of the little problem. The 
water-color enthusiast often loses patience with a slow 
pupil and paints the most of the picture. Even where 
the actual work is not done, the directions are sometimes 
so minute and exact that there is little real independent 
activity left for the pupil. 
Mental Activity—The stimulation of real activity in 
thinking is much more difficult than it is in motor learn- 
ing. One of the most difficult problems of the beginning 
teacher is the determination of how much real mental ac- 
tivity has taken place in the mind of the pupil. That
-P-A-G-E-86
  66 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
this remains a problem for many teachers is one of the 
most general defects in teaching. It will require pains- 
taking work by the supervisor in order to assist in the 
matter. He must have the ability to discuss the psycho- 
logical processes in a simple, concrete manner, and above 
all must be able to show the teacher clearly how to check 
up by asking other questions. Many children acquire the 
ability to talk fluently in class and the casual observer 
would think that some excellent learning was taking place. 
An interpretative question or two, a call for implications 
of what has been said, will reveal in some cases that the 
pupil had no real understanding of the matter discussed. 
The supervisor should emphasize, also, the fact that 
self-activity, especially in reflective thinking, takes time. 
It is very difficult for the quick, nervous teacher to wait 
for answers, but she must do it. Teachers who take sen- 
tences out of the mouths of pupils soon discourage attempts 
to answer. Certain commercial teachers harp constantly 
on the making of quick decisions, and insist that the busi- 
ness man is noted for the ability to think quickly and 
accurately. They do not know enough psychology to un- 
derstand that the ability to think quickly and accurately 
is the product of a long period of practice, experimenta- 
tion, trial and error, ete. 
On the other hand, the supervisor should warn the 
teacher against devoting too much class time to the ac- 
tivity of one pupil. Many teachers think it an index of 
pedagogical expertness to pursue a pupil with a series of 
questions while he struggles with a difficult thought process. 
This is legitimate in cases where the majority of the class 
would have the same difficulty but a serious blunder when 
most of the children are eager to answer. Even in cases 
where such procedure is proper, the teacher should be on 
the alert to observe the point at which the law of diminish- 
ing returns enters into pupil activity. Keeping the class
-P-A-G-E-87
‘THE LEARNING PROCESS 67 
activity above this point is an index of skillful question- 
ing. The special difficulties of the few slow pupils are fit 
problems for supervised study periods and should not be 
allowed to waste the time of the class. 
In this matter of activity we again have the problem 
of the utilization of spontaneous reactions from the pupils. 
Even that activity manifested in opposition to the wishes 
of the teacher and the welfare of the school can be directed 
and turned to pedagogical ends. A great cartoonist, known 
to all Americans to-day, was soundly thrashed almost every 
week in a rural school because he persisted in drawing 
cartoons for the amusement of the other children. The 
school did its best to knock out of this boy his great talent, 
instead of developing it and using it to the advantage of 
everyone concerned. Such a pupil can be of material as- 
sistance in making blackboard illustrations, posters, ete. 
We have already mentioned the utilization of the activity 
manifested by the boy with a jackknife. Much of the 
bullying and domineering on the playground is leadership 
activity gone wrong and from his broader experience the 
supervisor can suggest ways and means of utilizing it. 
Self-Control, Self-Restraint, and Inhibition, as Forms 
of Self-Activity—The following quotation‘ calls atten- 
tion to a phase of self-activity that is often overlooked: 
Finally, activity may as well result in the inhibition as in the 
production of ideas and feelings and movements. <A fifth-grade 
schoolroom in which the children sit quietly reading or move about 
in a businesslike way may represent more rea) activity than a 
room in which the children are waving their hands, incessantly 
making comments and asking questions. The first room may, it 
is true, represent mere repression and absence of interest and 
work; but it may represent interest, thought, and work plus the 
inhibition of aimless expressions thereof. It must not be for~ 
gotten that not to think the foolish, irrelevant thought is the 
*E. L, Thorndike, Principles of Teaching, 1906, p. 40.

      SUPERVISION ANID TEACHING 
essential of reasoning; that not to follow the wrong impulse is the 
essential of character; that not to|make the aimless and crude 
movement is the essential of skill. Success is in great measure no 
making failures. What a man does depends upon what impulse: 
are neglected or overcome. We are what we are by reason 0: 
what we are not—what we do not permit ourselves to become, 
Activity is inhibitory as well as impulsive. 
Thorndike’s remarks do not imply that the teacher sere 
restrain and control. The pupils must be allowed a cer- 
tain amount of experimentation and trial and error iH 
order to learn self-control and self-restraint. The teacher 
will interfere, of course, when there is the possibility o: 
wasteful or disastrous errors. 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCE 
Probably a very early generalization on the part of eve 
child is to the effect that one parent is more easily handle 
than the other. It is soon learned that some people are 
good-natured, others not, some quick, others slow, ete. 
This fact of individual variation is one of the most obvious 
and is observed everywhere. No teacher is so slow-witted 
as to fail to note very early in her experience that hi 
pupils vary materially in many different ways. Altho es 
children of any age group have certain fundamental char- 
acteristics in common, thus making possible group instruc- 
tion, they differ markedly in many details, so that all 
possible attention to them as individuals is necessary. i 
two children in any class will have exactly the same i 
herited tendencies, and they will furthermore have be 
influenced by all the myriad factors in differing hom 
school, and street environments. The differences ma: 
fested will be in general intelligence, in special abiliti 
and capacities, in temperament, in image type, ete. Some- 
times the peculiarity will be due to heredity and will thus      
   
   
      
  
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 69 
be permanent. In other instances it is a temporary thing 
due to sickness, absence from school, remediable physical 
defect, poor teaching, etc. Chapter XIII will be devoted 
to the use of tests and measurements that determine the 
nature and amount of such differences, and to a discussion 
of remedial measures. The differences themselves will be 
illustrated briefly below. 
General Intelligence—The differences between im- 
beciles, morons, ordinary children, and very bright children 
are obvious, and no one denies that they need differing 
treatment and do differing amounts of work. But in the 
ordinary schoolroom the differences are much less marked 
than those listed and more difficult to detect. Even when 
the teacher divides the class into three rough groups, slow, 
average, and fast, these groups shade off imperceptibly into 
each other. With a normal distribution of intelligence, the 
lowest ten per cent of the class is not eapable of doing 
anything like the amount of work covered by the highest 
ten per cent, or even as much as the middle ten per cent. 
Sometimes the distribution will be such as to place the 
majority of the class towards the lower end of the curve, 
sometimes well toward the upper end. 
Special Abilities and Capacities—If any group of chil- 
dren is given a set of simple arithmetic problems, well 
within their grasp, one or two pupils will do from three 
to six times as many problems as one or two other pupils, 
the rest of the class falling in between. Actual instances 
show one pupil doing three problems while another in the 
same class was doing twenty. In another case one pupil 
did five while his seatmate did forty-four. Even the 
median student in this class was four times faster than the 
slowest one. In spelling one boy got twenty words right 
while his classmate got ninety-six, the median pupil getting 
seventy. Wide differences can be seen in written composi- 
tion, in art and in music, though they are more difficult to
-P-A-G-E-90
70 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  express in objective terms. The same differences are notice- 
able in motor skills also. 
Image Type—People vary as regards the kind of 
images, visual, auditory, motor, ete. that they use in 
their mental processes. There are a number of easily ad- 
ministered tests for the determination of image type, and 
there was for a time great interest in attempting to utilize 
the results of such tests in teaching. Teachers were adyised 
to stimulate the pupil through the sense in terms of which 
the imagery was carried on. While this sounded logical 
to the amateur psychologist, the facts of the matter are 
that an individual may not remember and think in the 
same terms in which the original material was received. 
Many people who are clearly visual in imagery learn 
easily through auditory perception; others who are 
markedly auditory or motor in imagery learn best through 
visual presentations. In other words, imagery and percep- 
tion do not necessarily proceed in the same sense modality 
equally well. In addition, practically everyone is more 
or less mixed in type, capable of imaging rather well in 
any of three types. In regard to adaptation to image type 
Thorndike says :> 
The wise course then is to arrange stimuli to appeal through 
several sense avenues, but to let the emphasis be on the kind 
of response of action or inference that the pupil makes, not upon 
the kind of imagery by means of which he proceeds to that 
response. 
Although the cultivation of the capacities for imaging is hardly 
worth while, the methods commonly taken to cultivate them are 
for other reasons very useful. Thus it is an excellent exercise to 
have one pupil describe a tree that he has seen and let the others 
decide what kind of tree it is. The value of such exercise does 
not, however, lie in the improvement of the capacity for imaging. 
In our illustration the boy who describes and the others who

THE LEARNING PROCESS 71 
decide what is described may or may not base their conclusions on 
visual images. But they must, to describe clearly and to infer 
correctly from the description, know certain realities about trees. 
To ask a student, “If you were a creature who could see clearly at 
a distance of two thousand miles and were hundreds of miles in 
the air above St. Louis, what would be some of the important 
features that you would see to the west? To the east? To the 
north? To the south?”; to say, “Suppose that you had lived in 
Tilinois 200 years ago, how would the country have looked, what 
would you have seen the inhabitants doing?”; to say, “Think now 
of just how the oak leaf and the chestnut leaf look so as to tell me 
the difference between them”—these are useful exercises because 
right responses to them mean real knowledge, but it is of little 
consequence what sort of images arouse the responses. 
Temperament.—The traditional temperaments are the 
sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic. These 
are found in many degrees and combinations, of which 
but a few can be mentioned. The too sanguine individual 
is usually rather quick but superficial, tending to shift at- 
tention rapidly and to be satisfied with mediocre results, 
which he maintains are good. He usually needs to be 
held somewhat rigidly for results and to be made to under- 
stand that his judgment of the results is not sufficient. The 
choleric temperament, as the name indicates, is quick to 
anger but usually as quick to cool off, usually very positive 
in likes and dislikes, narrow in judgment. They may be, 
however, very good thinkers in some instanees when not 
excited. They need to be trained in self-control by social 
means, and in the suspension of judgment. Difficulties 
with this type will probably arise more often in discipline 
than in learning. The phlegmatie type is slow and more 
difficult to arouse to interest and effort, though they may 
be fair thinkers. The melancholic tends to be self-centered, 
narrow in range of thought and interest, slow in getting 
results. 
Some first-rate thinkers are puzzled and discouraged by rapid
-P-A-G-E-92
  72 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
questions or drills. Some children think and feel so intensely that 
they need the bit of calmness, humor, and relaxation rather than 
the spur of excitement or rebuke. Some children cannot think 
of more than one thing at a time and are lost in a lesson if the 
teacher introduces side issues or comparative references which 
broader-minded children follow easily.® 
Kirkpatrick suggests the following caution in regard to 
the nervous child :? 
It is especially important that the nervous child should not be 
scolded, found fault with, or in any way induced to work hard 
or worry about his work. A teacher who is loud of voice, un- 
attractive in dress, and sudden and variable in manner is espe- 
cially irritating to a nervous child, and may be the chief occasion 
of the nervousness. Although a teacher should be quick to note 
signs of nervousness, she should avoid making the child con- 
scious of his condition. The establishment of regular habits of 
work and of rest or amusement are of great value in decreasing 
nervousness. 
On the other hand, the quiet and soothing manner of 
some teachers works a benefit to the nervous child that 
needs no elaboration here. Supervisors should read Thorn- 
dike, Kirkpatrick, and other writers on child psychology. 
Differences in Leadership, Management of People, Un- 
derstanding of Social Situations, ete.—Pupils differ most 
markedly in these personal qualities, and the school should 
do its utmost to develop capacity for leadership and the 
ability to understand other people. In some instances the 
teacher will have to repress or re-direct a wrong type of 
leadership that will appear. 
These qualities are not susceptible of exact measurement 
but can be easily detected by both teacher and pupil. In 
a certain sixth grade made up largely of the ‘‘rough and

  THE LEARNING PROCESS 73 
  ready’’ type of boy, there was one lad of somewhat better 
social status and home training. He manifested an ability 
to talk to teachers and visitors without embarrassment, to 
think on his feet, and to carry off difficult situations in a 
way that put to shame the more boisterous members of the 
class. Though not a ‘‘sissy’’ in any way, this boy was 
unpopular with his mates and was rarely, if ever, chosen 
for a prominent place on the playground or in pupil activ- 
ities. But when the entire grade was caught in a serious 
misdemeanor which necessitated appearing before the au- 
gust presence of the principal, they, with one voice, chose 
the suave young diplomat to present their case. 
This recognition of the different types of leadership has 
its lessons for the school. Pupils can be made conscious 
of the problem involved and be stimulated to develop the 
necessary qualities through the study of great leaders in 
history and fiction, in social and political affairs. The 
socialized recitation, the committee work done by pupils, 
the accurate portrayal of certain characters in dramatiza- 
tions, all afford opportunities for training in some of the 
capacities under discussion here. . 
There are, of course, many more of these personal char- 
acteristics than those mentioned above. Parker mentions 
self-control, energy, precision, thoroughness, originality, 
coéperation, self-denial, self-reliance, refinement, sym- 
pathy, ete., ete. 
Age-Grade and Age-Progress Differences.—The school 
entrance age has been traditionally six years and progress 
thereafter was thought to approximate a grade a year. 
The analytic, objective studies of the past decade, how- 
ever, have made clear that six is not necessarily the best 
age for all pupils to enter, and that the grade-a-year pro- 
cession through the school is but a pleasant fiction. 
A great number of unsuspected facts came to light when 
this supposedly simple factor of age was investigated. The
-P-A-G-E-94
  74 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
simple but very important discovery was made that the 
very method of computing school age was careless and 
imaceurate. Strayer and Engelhardt in The Classroom 
Teacher® present elaborate tables for determining more 
exactly the age group in which it is proper to classify a 
given pupil on a given date and for establishing more 
accurate age groups for the school grades. 
A study of mental age in relation to chronological age 
makes clear that six is not universally the best age for 
entrance. The tables referred to above should be inter- 
preted when possible in the light of mental age, since 
progress and achievement at any chronological age is quali- 
fied by the mental maturity of the individual, or his 
mental age.® 
By examining any grade in the light of these tables, the 
exact number of under-age, normal-age, and over-age 
pupils can be determined. Obviously the type of material 
presented, the mode of instruction used by the teacher, 
the progress of individuals and of the class, will all be 
vitally conditioned by the relative size of the groups within 
amy grade. The supervisor’s problem is more complicated 
than that of the teacher because no two grades will pre- 
sent quite the same age-group make-up. For instance, 
Strayer’s figures show a certain 7B grade to contain 18.7 
per cent under-age pupils, 25 per cent normal-age, and 
56.3 per cent over-age, while a fourth grade examined 
contained 17.5 per cent under-age, 62.5 per cent normal- 
age, and but 20 per cent over-age pupils. Any three or 
four grades of the same level may present to the supervisor 
radically different situations. 
While the facts regarding the age groups in any grade 
are of assistance in adapting instruction to that grade, they 
  * New York, 1920, pp. 124-162. 
*See Chapter XIII.
-P-A-G-E-95
THE LEARNING PROCESS 75 
should be supplemented by the facts regarding differences 
in pupil-progress. Such facts, of course, can only be made 
available when there are complete and accurate records 
for the pupils concerned. These records should show for 
each pupil the date of entrance, continued absences, if any, 
regular and irregular promotions, failures whether grade 
or subject, ete. A compilation can then be made for any 
given class showing how many pupils and which ones have 
made normal progress of a grade a year, how many have 
failed of promotion one or more times, how many have 
“‘skipped’’ or been promoted to a grade or half-grade 
higher than the one next above. The study should be 
earried further to discover in which grades the majority 
of failures take place and at what places in the system 
pupils seem to ‘‘skip’’ with the greatest ease. The number 
of failures in individual subjects should be determined. 
These latter facts are valuable for guidance in revising the 
course of study, in examining the marking system, or in 
remodeling the teacher’s method of presentation. The 
facts regarding grade failures or ‘‘skips’’ should direct 
attention to the pupils as well, so that their native intelli- 
gence, health, home conditions, opportunities, ete., may be 
investigated. 
When all the facts concerning age distribution and indi- 
vidual progress have been gathered, the two faetors can 
be combined to show even more clearly the nature of the 
class under discussion. This combination will place the 
pupils in nine groups, since slow, normal, or rapid progress 
is possible for any child in any of the three age groups. As 
a rule the over-age pupils rarely, if ever, make rapid 
progress, and only a small per cent make normal progress. 
The under-age pupils usually make normal or rapid prog- 
ress. The fact that they are under-age for the grade is in 
itself one indication of rapid progress. The bulk of the 
class will usually fall in two groups, over-age-slow-progress
-P-A-G-E-96
  76 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
and normal-age-slow-progress. Every effort should be 
made to bring the normal-age group at least into the normal- 
progress list. 
The foregoing discussion can be made somewhat more 
conerete by examining the following figures. About 100 
seventh-grade children in Summit, New Jersey, were given 
the Terman Group Tests for mental ability and were found 
to range in score from 24 to 167, with a median of 72.36. 
Since the standard median is 67, and since the curve of 
distribution was nearly normal in shape, the class can be 
adjudged about normal. 
Using an age-grade table, computed for the proper date, 
however, 50.9 per cent of the group were found to be of 
normal age, 9.9 per cent were under age, and 39.2 per cent 
were over age. Examining the grade-progress statistics, 
49.14 per cent were found to have made normal progress, 
15.25 per cent, rapid progress, and 35.34 per cent, 
slow progress. This shows, disregarding other factors for 
the moment, that age and intelligence do not necessarily cor- 
respond, nor do progress and intelligence. 
The foregoing figures were kindly furnished by Super- 
intendent H. A. Sprague of Summit, as was the following 
abbreviated statement of the remedial measures to be 
applied by administrative and supervisory officers: 
Pupils of high intelligence quotients as shown by test are being 
promoted immediately after examination, provided that their 
classwork is of high grade.~ These children are inspired by such 
promotions and invariably succeed ... The children who are 
doing particularly strong work, but for whom we cannot secure 
sufficient evidence for immediate promotion, are brought together 
into small coaching groups and are invariably promoted at the 
end of two months . . . Pupils at the low end of the scale are 
placed in a special school where they may receive a more varied 
type of training, or are brought together in small groups for 
special coaching in order that they may be promoted with their 
grades... . It may be seen that the low positions in the age- 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
THE LEARNING PROCESS 7 
grade and grade-progress tables should be overcome by intensive 
and persistent work. It is our plan to overcome such distribu- 
tions by special treatment. 
‘When in the beginning of the term classes are necessarily over- 
size, the director of this special work is asked to reclassify or 
grade the children on the basis of their achievement and intelli- 
gence ratings. A progressive class for especially rapid promotion 
has been organized. The work of these pupils will continue under 
one teacher for a long period of time. A considerable saving is 
expected to result from this organization. 
Education quotients will be obtained in order that pupils may 
be instructed according to their capacity for good work... 
Special attention is given to the pupils in the first and fourth 
quartiles of all grades by way of follow up work... All new 
pupils are tested and recommended for placement. 
The Teacher’s Reaction to Variations.—There are two 
errors made by many teachers in this matter of individual 
difference. One type of teacher ruthlessly over-rides any- 
thing of the sort and teaches as she wishes to teach or as 
the plan book says to teach, regardless of intelligence level, 
special ability, or any other element of variability. The 
second type of teacher makes the somewhat natural error 
for the naive thinker, namely, of thinking principally in 
terms of herself. Those pupils in the class who approxi- 
mate the teacher in speed or slowness, narrowness or 
breadth, or temperament, fare very well, while upon the 
others is visited the wrath of the ruling goddess, who is 
unaware that minds differ materially in speed and nature 
of reaction. However, the vast majority of teachers are 
keenly aware of the problem and sincere in their desire 
to adapt instruction within reasonable limits to meet the 
situation. 
The Supervisor’s Assistance to Teachers: Testing.— 
The first function of the supervisor in this field is to ad- 
minister, or assist teachers in administering, standardized 
intelligence tests and educational measurements. Giving 
* these tests and interpreting the results in order to de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
    78 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
termine the nature and extent of difference among pupils 
is the first step toward meeting the problem. As stated 
above, a chapter will be devoted later to this phase of su- 
pervisory activity.?° 
In addition to testing, the supervisor should gather such 
information as is available regarding the previous school 
history, disease record, and home conditions of unusual or 
marked cases. Usually this duty cannot be performed by 
either supervisor or teacher very well because of the time 
involved, but the supervisor should urge the matter upon 
the administration in an effort to see that this information 
is gathered and kept on file by some competent school 
officer. Many of the intelligence tests now have blanks 
ineluded for this information, as it is regarded as a vital 
part of the diagnosis. Bahn 
Teaching Devices——One of the most intelligent devil 
so far evolved is the division, as far as the teacher is con- 
cerned, of the class into two or three groups. Sometimes 
these groups are organized separately into ‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B”’ 
divisions, or into ‘‘slow,’’ ‘‘medium,’’ and ‘‘fast’’ sections. 
In other cases the class is kept together for recitation. In 
either case the teaching is adapted as far as possible to 
these three groups) Whatever the difficulties in the way 
and however poor the manipulation of this device may be, 
it would seem to be admittedly better than adapting the 
instruction to one group only, namely, the middle of the 
class, as it is now in most cases. Actual figures show that 
under the present system the brightest students have from 
one-fourth to over one-half of their time to waste, while the 
slower pupils who are dragged over the ground much too 
rapidly can do better work and earn higher grades when 
given more time and some assistance bearing on their in- 
dividual difficulties. 
  
See Chapter XIII. }
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 79 
The elements in the scheme are: division into three 
groups, a minimum assignment for all to complete, sup- 
plementary assignments for the bright pupils, a scheme 
of individual help for the slow ones. The minimum as- 
signment should be the bare essentials without which the 
pupil cannot progress in the subject and failing which he 
must be judged incapable of further progress. The system 
of individual help for the slow ones involves some form 
of supervised study, which will be discussed in Chapter IX. 
The organization of supplementary assignments presents 
the opportunity for considerable variation and originality 
on the part of teachers. In the formal subjects involving 
much drill, proficiency can be determined by means of 
standardized tests, and the leaders excused from further 
drill other than an occasional test to see that the associa- 
tions are firmly fixed. Such pupils can then be given other 
work, such as lists of problems applying the drill facts. 
Problems can be mimeographed and supplied, or the 
teacher can have a list of references to other texts. Pupils 
ean even be given work in other subjects, such as supple- 
mentary reading, construction, ete.1* 
In geography the minimum essentials would consist of 
the usual facts contained in the text that are necessary for 
understanding future work. The brighter ones can be 
given reading upon which to report to the class, thus 
bringing to the class much worth-while material. The 
pupils reporting gain the information and in addition the 
skill in reading, organizing, and reporting on data. The 
slow ones benefit materially from hearing interesting ma- 
terial not contained in the text. History presents the same 
opportunity. 
There are two objections to the plan outlined. The first 
is that no teacher has time to organize any sufficient system 
4 See Chapter VIII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
    80 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
of supplementary assignments. This is in a measure true, 
but such a system is the product of a period of growth and 
of the joint efforts of several people. A group of teachers 
working under the direction of a supervisor can very well 
organize such a system without undue expenditure of time 
or energy. The effort will take time, of course, but 
need not necessitate the teachers’ giving up afternoon and 
evenings to extra school work, though it will pinch the 
teacher who is proud of the fact that she forgets her work 
when the last bell rings and does not think of it again 
until 9 a.m. Between the two extremes there is ample 
room for much good constructive work by teachers that 
is neither a tax nor an imposition. In addition, there is 
much excellent material summarized here and there which 
might be collected, ready to use. A good example will 
be found in the Nineteenth Yearbook, Part 1, National So- 
ciety for the Study of Education. 
A second objection to any plan involving division into 
groups is that it is undemocratic and stigmatizes those 
pupils in the slow group. Many such objections are based 
upon theoretical and highly sentimental reasons, and it is 
the duty of the administration to conduct a careful edu- 
cational campaign through any agencies that offer. There 
is no reason to see dire consequences for democracy in group 
divisions when those divisions are based upon incontro- 
vertible, mathematically precise evidence. If parents object 
to their children being placed in the slow group when in- 
telligence tests, special-ability tests, the opinion of half 
a dozen teachers and supervisory experts place them there, 
then the parents must be tactfully educated and made to 
see that it is more efficient and better for the child. If 
they cannot be so educated, they will have to be left with 
  
”Such a plan is described in an article by Dr. Gray, in the 
Elementary School Journal for December, 1919, p. 268. 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
    THE LEARNING PROCESS 81 
their objections. Sometimes such people will be numerous 
and powerful enough to affect public opinion and break 
up the system. As soon as they have broken it up, it should 
be started over again as quietly and carefully as possible.1* 
However, much of the criticism can be averted by proper 
administration of the scheme. No one outside the school 
officers need know the real nature of the divisions. In 
places where difficulties have arisen, they have often been 
traced back to injudicious remarks by teachers. Scrupu- 
lous care should be taken to avoid any derogatory designa- 
tion of the slow groups. There is an advantage in this 
respect in cases where the whole group is kept together, 
the brighter ones being excused from some recitations and 
drills. 
Even when the division is actually made and the idea 
underlying it is known, trouble is often avoided. Tactful 
introduction and explanation of the plan prevents many 
untrue and unfair ideas and foolish remarks from being 
circulated. Such a plan was organized in Arlington, Mas- 
sachusetts, and the following list of benefits, listed after a 
trial, indicates that the underlying idea was known to all 
concerned without ill effects: 
1, Stimulates pupils to more and better work; those in high 
group wishing to retain their places, those in lower groups 
wishing to rise. 
2. Temptation removed for teacher to concentrate on bright 
pupil. 
. Net amount of work is greater than under usual plan. 
. Possibility of discovering unusual ability is increased. 
. Fewer failures. (Only 5.2 per cent in Arlington as against 
an average of 20 per cent in many states.) 
6, Stimulates increased interest on part of parents and friends 
of pupils. OU oo

N. E. A. Proceedings, 1918, pp. 298-314.
-P-A-G-E-102
  82 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
7. Initiative of pupils increased. Ordinarily bright pupils do 
most of the work. In this plan they are grouped by 
themselves and slower ones get chance to shine. 
8. Elimination is reduced and a larger percentage graduate. 
Administrative Devices.—Adaptations to individual dif- 
ferences by means of administrative devices are becoming 
more and more common and are accepted by all but the 
most formal school people. One such device is the pro- 
vision:: that allows the pupils markedly advanced or 
markedly slow in one subject to take that one subject 
with a grade other than the one they are in regularly. 
Many slow, retarded pupils can be given a large amount 
of wood-work or other manual training and in such sub- 
jects keep up with grades well in advance. Transferring 
over-age boys to the junior high school has been beneficial 
in many instances. There is always a sprinkling of pupils 
who are remarkably poor spellers, or poor in number work, 
but who can keep up otherwise. In many places even yet 
such failure in one subject prevents the pupil from pass- 
ing to the next grade. Such practice is obviously without 
rational basis, is unfair and detrimental to the student. 
Another device is to pass pupils from one grade to another, 
not for one subject, but permanently at other than the 
regular promotion periods. Many of the very bright 
pupils are entirely competent to carry the work of a grade 
beyond where their age level ordinarily places them. On 
the other hand, many authorities object to this, holding 
that pupils are happier when with others of their own 
age. This group would take care of the bright pupils by 
enriching the curriculum with much extra material. Where 
such enrichment is possible, this is undoubtedly a good 
thing, but there are many small systems where it is out of 
the question. Some retarded pupils are often helped in 
the same manner by being passed regardless of the fact 
that they have failed in everything. It is fairly safe to
-P-A-G-E-103
       THE LEARNING PROCESS 83 
say that the retarded child should not be held in the same 
room for the third year. The organization of the ungraded 
room is the natural outcome of finding a large percentage 
of abnormally slow or defective pupils in a system. 
This discussion does not mean that the regular and 
orderly procedure of the school should be broken up in 
order to promote individuals by subjects or irregularly by 
grades. The cases calling for such treatment are not 
numerous enough to disrupt the system but numerous 
enough to be cared for when they do appear. 
Individual Variation in Teaching Ability—The super- 
visor will have to adjust himself to many differences in 
personality and temperament among his teachers, and to 
take note of their differing professional abilities. These 
factors will be discussed in detail in Chapters XIV to 
XVII, inclusive, but one of them should be emphasized 
here, namely, the differing abilities manifested by teachers 
in teaching the so-called special subjects, such as art and 
music. More and more attention is being given to these 
subjects in the training of teachers, but there will be for 
some time yet many teachers who are quite unable to teach 
them well. The best solution for these teachers is to ex- 
_change classes for a period a day with someone who likes 
the special subjects and teaches them well. Supervisors 
should assist in organizing such plans for exchange, rather 
than oppose them, as is sometimes the case. 
Number of Children in a Room.—Discussion of the 
varations in children, and of the difficulties of adjusting 
instruction to them, raises a question in regard to the 
proper number of children to assign to one teacher. A 
very prominent administrator has stated that he has no use 
for any teacher who cannot handle 40 children without 
trouble. Most schoolrooms are built and equipped with a 
limit of 40 in mind. While there are no experimental data 
upon which to base conclusions, it seems safe to say that 40
-P-A-G-E-104
  84 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
is far too many for one teacher to instruct efficiently. This 
number would present difficulty even if the distribution 
of intelligence were normal and be out of the question with 
any group drawn largely from the lower end of the curve. 
Inquiries made of many experienced teachers elicit the fact 
that they regard 25 or 30 children of normal distribution as 
a proper number, and 40 as too many even as a maximum 
number in emergency cases. 
QUESTIONING 
Early discussions regarding the technique of questioning 
were confined, with a few notable exceptions, to classifica- 
tion and description of types of questions. They were about 
as valuable, according to De Garmo, as was the formula for 
learning French in 11 days: divide the language into 11 
parts and learn one part each day! There are now, how- 
ever, many excellent studies of questioning, statistical as 
well as theoretical, and some pronouncements can be made 
safely. 
Thoroughly good questioning is a most difficult problem, 
and it remains a problem, at least in part, for many good 
teachers. It requires the ability, native or acquired, to 
think quickly and easily while facing a class, to shift and 
change as thought progresses, and to phrase questions 
clearly and unambiguously. These requirements puncture 
in some measure the pleasant fiction that the slow but 
efficient thinker can, in the end, do anything that the quick 
person can. A slow thinker, no matter how efficient and 
conscientious, will always have difficulty with a class of 
normal pupils. Furthermore, these requirements point to 
the necessity of lesson planning whether elaborately or in 
brief. Very few people are gifted enough to be able to 
follow the thought of a group, to shift and turn quickly 
enough, to guide the lesson to the desired end, without some
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 85 
previous preparation. Careful planning involving a study 
of the subject matter cannot fail to suggest to the teacher 
many of the possible questions and digressions with which 
she will be confronted. Planning for these in advance saves 
much time and energy during the class period, in addition 
to preventing some erroneous thinking. 
Questions can be grouped roughly in two classes: thought 
" questions designed to stimulate the pupil’s reflective proc? 
esses, and drill questions designed to test the pupil’s mem- 
ory of isolated facts or arbitrary associations. The follow- 
ing discussion applies generally to both types, though they 
are markedly different in respect to number and speed in a 
given period. Drill questions may be numerous and rapidly 
given, the answers coming almost immediately. Thought 
questions, on the other hand, require time, and the teacher 
must school herself to wait patiently until the thinking is 
done. 
Characteristics of Good Questions—Use words well 
within the vocabulary of the pupil. The first element in 
good questioning, freedom from unknown and ambiguous 
words or obscure expressions, involves the principle of 
apperception discussed above. Foreign or obsolete words 
will probably not be found in grade-school questions but 
the best of teachers often use common words that are still 
beyond the comprehension of a majority of the class. Many 
children are badly confused by being asked to ‘‘Discuss the 
influence of ... ,’’ or ‘‘Compare the industries of ... ,’’ 
since the words ‘‘influence’’ and ‘‘compare’’ are not yet 
understood. The illustration given above of the class fail- 
ing a question because of the word ‘‘semester’’ used in 
place of the word ‘‘term”’ is a case in point. 
Closely allied to this element of freedom from unknown 
words is the matter of avoiding words that may have more 
than one meaning, or that do not: direct thought clearly to 
what is wanted. In a lower-grade geography class working 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
    86 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
with direction and distance the question was asked, ‘‘How 
would you get from the depot to the Elberton Hotel?’’ The 
teacher became very angry when a boy answered without 
any trace of impudence, ‘‘I’d walk.’’ 
Avoid involved phrases and digressions. If questions 
are to direct thought they must be directly to the point, 
avoiding long and involved phrases or supposedly facetious 
digressions. Several excellent examples of questions open 
to criticism in this respect, too long to quote here, may be 
found in De Garmo, Interest and Education, pages 184-185. 
Certain questions, clear enough as regards language, are 
confusing because they call for more or less final answers 
when such answers are not available or can only be guessed 
at by the pupils. They are directed at the causes and 
solutions of certain historical events—wars, revolutions, 
economic upheavals, political movements, etc., or call for 
moral judgments to be passed upon such events, If super- 
ficial answers are accepted, the pupils are being trained in 
poor thinking, because the real answers to such questions 
have puzzled the best thinkers of the day. Such questions 
are permissible when it is clearly understood that they are 
to stimulate discussion, to stimulate a search for data and 
their organization, and to train in suspension of judg- 
ment. There should be permitted difference of opinion 
regarding the proper answer. It is to be regretted that 
certain textbooks set forth definitely explanations and solu- 
tions of events that have never been explained to the satis- 
faction of expert thinkers. 
Another type of question that lacks clarity is one involv- 
ing two ideas. ‘‘Why is alcohol not a food and why is it 
bad for us?’’ ‘‘Did the German submarine have a right 
to enter our ports and what ought we to do about it?’’ 
A type of question that is clear enough but extremely 
poor is that which calls for but one small item. Usually such 
questions come in a series, four or five being used to extract
-P-A-G-E-107
THE LEARNING PROCESS 87 
from the pupil an answer that should have been given in a 
complete statement and in answer to one question. 
Half-trained teachers often decry the use of ‘‘yes’’ or 
no’’ questions. Such questions are to be criticised only 
when the thinking stops there; followed by questions re- 
lating to the reasons for the stand taken, they are quite 
legitimate. 
Adapt to individual differences. There has been con- if ' 
siderable debate in regard to the distribution of the more 
difficult thought questions. Many teachers held that they 
should be given to the weak student in order to spur him 
to effort and to give him practice in analyzing difficult 
situations. Success is said to bring satisfaction and con- 
fidence. On the other hand, the poor student is seldom 
able to solve such questions, and while he may get some 
practice in thinking, he is more likely to become embar- 
rassed and confused. The time of the class is wasted as 
well. The better plan is probably to distribute these ques- 
tions among the brighter pupils. Their analysis of the 
situation is of value to the slower students, who can follow 
their fellow students better in many cases than they can the 
teacher. The weaker pupils should then be given the easier 
questions which they can solve with some degree of facility. 
Such questions will probably afford them as much oppor- 
tunity for thinking as they are capable of profiting by. 
The flashy, superficial pupil should be given difficult 
questions and held rigidly for results, in order that he may 
appreciate the value of good work and correct analysis. 
Mechanical Features.—Questions should be addressed to 
the whole group and the pupil designated in a moment or 
two, thus inducing everyone to attend and at least to start 
thinking about the answer. Alphabetical or other fixed 
orders of calling on pupils should be avoided, though some 
device to insure fair distribution must be provided. 
Glancing over the roll just previous to class and noting “ce 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-108
/ 88 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
those who have been missed lately will help. Writing those 
names on a card is even better. Shuffling class cards is 
another good device. One of the chief reasons for failure 
to distribute questions is the fact that teachers very nat- 
urally tend to favor those children who ask questions them- 
selves, who volunteer, and who contribute to the recitation 
period, and this can be adjusted by some such device as 
suggested above. 
It might be noted in passing that many teachers dislike 
the pupil who asks questions and strive to discourage such 
activity. Careful distinction should be made, of course, 
between the interested, alert pupil who asks intelligent and 
legitimate questions and the bluffer who wastes time with 
many foolish and irrelevant ones. Teachers who consist- 
ently discourage the first type of pupil indicate either great 
laziness or complete ignorance regarding their functions as 
teachers. If they will not or cannot encourage, guide, and 
enter into the learning process of the pupils, they should 
be summarily dismissed. 
Questions should not be habitually repeated because this 
makes for lack of attention. However, care should be taken 
not to offend or embarrass the conscientious pupil who 
occasionally asks for repetition of a question he could not 
hear or did not understand. Curt refusal to repeat is 
legitimate in the case of the consistently inattentive pupil. 
Many teachers tend very naturally to repeat the answers, 
either for emphasis or to better the wording. This is a 
most difficult fault to eradicate, but it should be attended 
to as it tends to encourage fragmentary, incomplete, and 
poorly worded answers. 
It has long been customary for teachers to demand that 
pupils’ answers be in the form of complete statements. 
This is undoubtedly a good thing in most instances, espe- 
cially in content subjects involving class discussions, but it 
is to be noted that there are other ‘class exercises in which 
  Le

such a procedure slows down the lesson materially. In 
addition, like situations in real life would not demand the 
complete answer. 
SumMMaRY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
Obviously the general principles discussed here will be 
observed in their proper setting as factors in regular lessons. 
Outlines for these lessons will be given in succeeding chap- 
ters, but the summary of questions below will serve to focus 
the supervisor’s attention on the salient points. Sometimes 
it may be well to observe a teacher for some particular 
feature, such.as’provision for self-activity in the pupils, and 
at such times:the questions may be used by themselves. 
Students in supervision will also find them useful in early 
observations when only one or two phases of a lesson can 
be observed successfully. Written criticisms can be made 
and conferences held, using such outlines as a basis, provid- 
ing the teachers are also supplied with them. 
Ozsservation Ourtuine IncuupiIne Some or THE GENERAL 
PrINcIPLES OF LEARNING 
Apperception 
1. Does the teacher make use of the pupils’ immediate environ- 
ment and past experience: use words within their com- 
prehension? 
2. When necessary can she supply new experiences quickly and 
easily? Does she use stories, other books, pictures, real 
objects, excursions, the sand table? Does she herself 
thoroughly understand the new experience she is pre- 
senting? 
3. Is she quick to see that she has used words and illustrations 
the pupils do not comprehend—‘‘has talked over their 
heads’’? 
4. Does she carefully investigate and determine the reasons 
for pupils’ odd statements or peculiar answers? 
§. Does she use test or check questions designed to get real 
understanding on the part of the pupils instead of parrot- 
like repetition of words? 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Motive (Interest and Attention) 
. Does the teacher make skillful use of pupils’ instinctive 
interests? 
. Is she judicious in selecting interests to use; in regard to 
their general value; in regard to their value in the par- 
ticular instance? 
. Does she utilize, neglect, or over-ride those interests which 
show up spontaneously ? 
. Does she use the intrinsic worth of the subject matter or 
the pupils’ need for it as sources of motive? 
. Does she avoid mechanical devices and forced attention? 
Does she avoid using ridicule, sarcasm, harmful individual 
emulation, ete.? 
. Is the sum total of her efforts such as will train children 
to attack new and serious tasks efficiently? 
Self-Activity 
. Is the teacher active and alert, at the same time keeping 
her hands off pupils’ work? Does she stimulate and guide 
motor activity without domineering it? 
. Do her questions stimulate real mental activity? Does she 
avoid answering her own questions? | 
. Does she allow time for mental activity to take place? 
. In both motor and mental activity are experiments and mis-_ 
takes allowed for, and that self-correction stimulated 
which leads to self-restraint, self-control, and inhibition 
of undesirable forms of activity? 
. Does she take advantage of and utilize the spontaneous 
activities of the pupils? } 
. Is the sum total of her efforts toward independent and 
intelligent self-activity in the pupils? 
Individual Differences 
. Does the general attitude of the teacher in questioning, 
illustrating, helping, disciplining, indicate that she knows 
what individual differences are? | 
. In disposing of particular instances does she indicate that 
she understands the difference between children per- 
manently backward through inherited defect, and those
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 91 
temporarily backward because of absence, sickness, poor 
teaching, ete.? 
3. Does she make use of, or call for the use of, standard educa- 
tional measurements and mental tests in order to deter- 
mine the nature and amount of the differences? 
4, Is there plainly a minimum essentials requirement for all 
pupils; supplementary work or other provision for the 
bright pupil; some system of supervised study or outside 
help for the slow pupils? 
5. Is she in favor of, and will she codperate in, administrative 
schemes for individual and irregular promotion? 
Questioning 
1. Does the teacher manifest ability to word questions clearly 
and concisely? Avoid series of short, fragmentary ques- 
tions? 
2. Can she adjust easily to legitimate interruptions, disposing 
of them or following them up with clear-cut direct 
questions? Does she encourage independent questioning 
by the pupils? 
3. Is she quick to see when her language or construction is 
confusing to the class? Can she re-word statements 
quickly ? 
4. Does she use thought and drill questions in right propor- 
tion? Directed at proper material? Does she vary the 
pace? 
5. Does she distribute questions over the class fairly well? In 
terms of individual differences? 
6. Does she avoid answering the questions herself? Avoid 
repeating them except in legitimate cases? Insist on 
clear, intelligent answers? Avoid repeating the pupil’s 
answer? 
The Children 
Observations of pupils’ activity are of vital importance 
since their activity is the end toward which the teacher’s 
activity is directed. Such observations should be made 
during every visit of the supervisor, even those during 
which he is principally concerned with physical and routine 
factors, 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
92 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
1. Number in the room? 
2. Apparent social status? 
3. Approximate age distribution—number retarded, normal, 
accelerated? 
4, Apparent attitude toward the teacher? Courteous, indif- 
ferent, impertinent? 
5. Are they orderly and systematic in their work? Do they 
participate enthusiastically? Ask questions and discuss? 
Are they prompt and accurate in answering to routine 
signals? 
OxsERvaTION OUTLINE IN TERMS oF Purm ActTIvITY 
The foregoing outline in terms of teacher activity focuses 
the supervisor’s attention upon the method side. Much 
additional information and guidance can be obtained from 
observing critically the activities of the pupils, since they 
will reflect rather faithfully the work of the teacher during 
the weeks past. 
It is impossible, of course, to make an arbitrary differen- 
tiation of the pupils’ activities, and therefore many ques- 
tions under one of the headings below would fit as well 
under another. They are grouped for convenience in ref- 
erence. The supervisor will observe a total complex 
activity with no thought of separation. 
Apperception 
1. Do the pupils’ reactions indicate that they can interpret 
directions given them? Understand talks and questions? 
2. Are they able to reproduce in their own words stories they 
have read or heard? Do they recognize pictures and 
other book material as applicable to the story? 
3. Do they work out in concrete form new ideas received in 
instruction? In dramatization, in oral and written com- 
position, on the sand table, ete.? 
4. Do they indicate understanding by voluntarily relating per- 
sonal experiences or supplying illustrations that further 
the discussion? Do they check up on contributions that 
are not related to the lesson?
-P-A-G-E-113
    THE LEARNING PROCESS 93 
. Do they ask questions freely and confidently when they do 
not understand, or when they can go no further without 
assistance? 
. Do they offer to answer each other’s questions? To explain 
each other’s difficulties? 
. Do they consistently think, answer, question, illustrate, etc., 
in terms of relation between school subject matter and 
life about them, or only in terms of the subject matter 
abstractions? 
. Does the vocabulary of each pupil when tested measure up 
to standard for age and grade? 
Motive (Interest and Attention) 
. Do the pupils ask questions freely about things in and out 
of school that interest them? Do they seem confident, 
that the teacher will assist them with anything they are 
interested in? 
. In pursuing their interests do they avoid flighty, erratic 
and spasmodic attention to a variety of activities? 
. Do they work enthusiastically and consistently upon the 
work before them? Do they ask questions? Discuss 
with each other; with the teacher? 
. Do they voluntarily make use of books, pictures, maps, 
other people, ete., in order to obtain more information? 
Have they a normal interest in ‘‘what happens next’’? 
. Does their interest seem to be in the activity and results, 
rather than in the grades, marks, ‘‘getting out early,’” 
ete. 
. In pursuing their interests is there a growing recognition 
of the group interests? Do they try to compromise 
individual interests with those of the group? Do they 
raise problems and make contributions of interest to the 
majority? Drop topics in which but a few are interested? 
. Do they follow out such individual interests as are strong 
in such way as to benefit themselves and the group? 
Avoid emphasis on a selfish personal interest? 
. Do any pupils seem to be repressing interests through fear 
of sarcasm, ridicule, ete.? 
. Is the sum total of their activity of such nature as to 
interest them in the things they should be interested in?
-P-A-G-E-114
SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  Self-Activity 
1. Do the pupils manifest a real and aggressive interest in 
their work? Go about it with a minimum of direction 
from the teacher? Follow simple directions, or do what 
is needed without needless questions? 
2. While enthusiastic and hearty are they orderly and sys- 
tematic? 
3. Do they voluntarily use books, pictures, maps, other people, 
in order to obtain more information? Do they use these 
sources intelligently and independently? 
4. Do they suggest ways to do things, new sources of infor- 
mation? Do they try out suggestions, aid each other, 
work together? 
5. Do they take advantage of opportunity to work independ- 
ently without abusing the privilege? 
6. Do they discuss, argue, question, make contributions freely 
and confidently? 
7. Do they manifest a growing power to refrain from irrel- 
evant suggestions and disconnected remarks? To check 
up on each other in this matter? 
8. Do they learn through their mistakes in motor manipula- 
tion? Avoid making the same mistake over again? 
9. How does the type of activity, individual and group, in the 
schoolroom compare with that on the playground? 
10. Do any seem restrained for any reason? 
11. Is the sum total of their activity toward independence, self- 
reliance and initiative, coupled with proper respect for 
verification and good authority? 
Individual Differences 
1. Do the quick, bright pupils contribute actively and intelli- 
gently? Do they receive the contributions of the slower 
ones without manifesting impatience? 
2. Do they find extra work to do? Keep busy at additional 
assignments? At new sources? Practice skills and asso- 
ciations in which they are weak? 
3. Do the slow pupils seem confident that they may ask ques- 
tions or make contributions, ete.? 
4, Do they try to determine their own difficulties in recitation 
or in formal skills, and attack them in practice?
-P-A-G-E-115
  
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 95 
5. Do any of them seem timid, or afraid to contribute? 
6. Do pupils refrain from criticism or discontent when they 
are treated differently? (That is, is there a recognition 
of the justice of different treatment for different indi- 
viduals in the same situation?) 
7. Is there recognition by the class of special ability possessed 
by some individuals in the group? Are the artists, 
authors, diplomats, leaders, etc., used when the oppor- 
tunity presents itself? 
Answering Questions 
1. Are all pupils alert to each question? Do they avoid asking 
for unnecessary repetitions? 
Do they volunteer frequently, or wait to be called upon? 
Do they frankly state the fact that they do not know 
occasionally? Avoid ‘‘stalling’’ or ‘‘bluffing’’? 
Do they make complete, coherent answers when such 
answers are necessary? Do they manifest the ability to 
stand and talk for a minute or so in explaining a point? 
Do they answer with a word or phrase when this type of 
answer is legitimate? 
5. Do they avoid repeating themselves? Avoid repeating 
r what a pupil has already said? 
6. Do they answer with reasonable speed to drill questions? 
Take such time as is necessary to construct answers to 
thought questions? x 2p

  CHAPTER V 
LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 
A youngster about five years of age, traveling on a motor 
stage through the foothills of western Oregon, was in- 
tensely interested in the herds of cattle which were being 
brought down from the forests and mountain pastures. At 
intervals during the day the stage had to pull out over the 
side of the narrow road to pass herds, varying from 10 
to 50 head of cattle, each accompanied by one or two men 
in the picturesque dress of cowboys. Each herd was the 
occasion for a volley of questions from the small boy, the 
principal ones being, ‘‘What are those men doing?”’ 
““Where do they come from?’’ ‘‘Who are they?’’ After 
several such inquiries the lad’s father told him that the 
men were cowboys. After several minutes of quiet this ques- 
tion came: ‘‘Daddy, are cowboys men what wears leather 
pants, and guns, and big hats, and has ropes on their 
saddles?’’? There were several more parts to the long 
and involved question regarding the nature of the cow- 
boy. 
Later in the day the owner of the cattle rode by with 
some of his men and the boy immediately noted that this 
man did not wear ‘‘leather pants’’ and did not carry a 
rope. ‘‘Daddy, daddy, there’s one that isn’t a cowboy!’’ 
The entire passenger list enjoyed the ensuing argument 
in which the boy learned some of the less obvious essen- 
tials in the concept cowboy. 
Now what had taken place? The child had been brought

in contact with a number of illustrations or examples, or, 
we may say, had had a number of experiences. He had 
crudely abstracted the outstanding features of the differ- 
ent cases and tried to make a general statement or defini- 
tion that would fit all cowboys. He had then applied his 
definition to a new case, presenting slightly different as- 
pects, and had been forced to reconstruct the definition. In 
doing so he solved a problem and bettered his general 
idea as well. 
This incident illustrates well some of the phases of one 
of the most important learning processes. People learn 
definitions, laws, abstract meanings, etc., in just that way: 
by coming in contact with a number of illustrations or 
examples, eventually abstracting the essentials and form- 
ing a general statement. Sometimes the generalization 
springs into the mind upon meeting the first example and 
is reconstructed rapidly as others are met. The most in- 
telligent people deliberately suspend the process of gen- 
eralizing until they can find other examples with which to 
check the first. In some cases it is many months, or even 
years, until the idea is fully formed. 
On the other hand, people learn to use their ideas and 
to check up their correctness just as the child did, by apply- 
ing them to new cases as they are experienced. Some- 
times, as with the child, the idea itself has to be recon- 
structed; in other cases it fits and classifies the new ex- 
ample. Difficult cases of such classification give oppor- 
tunity for problem-solving thinking, involving the analysis 
of a strange new situation. 
One of the big tasks of the schools is to expedite these 
processes so that the individual may learn quickly and 
accurately many abstract meanings and definitions, which 
in real life might take months, and which might then be 
inaccurate because of the long unguided learning process.

The school must also afford opportunity for the learner 
to practice applying his ideas and to practice analyzing 
situations preparatory to such application. How may the 
school do this?) What are the essential steps involved in 
speeding up the natural learning processes? Many differ- 
ent answers have been made to these questions. 
Tue Movements or THOUGHT 
  In practically every textbook on pedagogy or general 
method there will be found a discussion of two types of 
teaching, one called the inductive lesson and the other 
the deductive lesson. The names are derived from the fact 
that induction and deduction are the names given to the 
two principal movements of thought. (When an individual 
is considering a number of particular experiences or ex- 
amples and trying to draw a general conclusion that will 
cover all such instances, as was the small boy above, he 
is said to be making an inductive inference. On the other 
hand, when he has one specific experience or example and 
a number of general conclusions, and is trying to classify 
the puzzling case under some known rule or principle, he 
is said to be making a deductive inference. The series of 
steps or procedures in arriving at a conclusion or in apply- 
ing one is fairly clear and is fundamentally the same for 
all people. The details and circumstances may differ most 
materially and cause many variations in the big movement 
of thought, but the essentials remain the same. Based then 
on the movements the mind goes through in making induc- 
tions and deductions, there have been worked out teaching 
procedures that aim to give the pupil opportunity to ex- 
ercise these natural processes in learning. 
However, when one tries to follow a movement of thought 
through from beginning to end, he is struck, if he is good 
at introspection, with the great difficulty of clearly differ-
-P-A-G-E-121
  LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 101 
entiating between the two movements, They persist in 
‘working together, now one and now the other uppermost. 
Every inductive movement involves deduction and vice 
versa. Furthermore, in his Methods of Teaching in High 
School, Parker brings out a point that has evidently been 
overlooked by other pedagogical writers, since none of them 
mention it: namely, that a careful reading of Dewey, How 
We Think, particularly pages 82 and 83, reveals the fact 
that Dewey’s use of the term ‘‘deduction’’ is materially dif- 
ferent from the average writer’s interpretation of it. Tak- 
ing Dewey as an authority in the matter, it would seem 
that the use of the term is unwise. This fact, together 
with the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between the 
two, has led Parker to discuss the lessons heretofore called 
inductive and deductive under the general heading, ‘‘Les- 
sons Involving Reflective Thought.’’ His treatment of 
lessons aimed at the acquisition of abstract meanings, while 
much better, corresponds in some measure to the older dis- 
cussions of inductive lessons. His discussion of problem- 
solving lessons corresponds roughly to the so-called de- 
ductive lesson. This more accurate terminology will be 
used in the present treatment, though the names for the 
lesson steps will be retained from the older treatments, for 
the sake of brevity and ease of organization. 
It must not be thought from the foregoing that the dis- 
cussion of inductive and deductive lessons is clearly beside 
the point and a waste of time. Despite great improve- 
ment, school work will always have an element of the arti- 
ficial and arbitrary in it, and the separation between induc- 
tion and deduction made by most writers is of value in 
that it provides teachers with a definite procedure that 
does in the main approximate the processes of reflective 
thought.

THe Maxine oF GENERALIZATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF 
AsstRACT MEANINGS, GENERAL NOTIONS, ETC. 
‘The Steps in the Process.—In the case of the youngster 
and the cowboys, interest was spontaneous. In most teach- 
ing exercises, interest or attention must be aroused and 
focused. In many cases, also, knowledge already in the 
possession of the child must be called up into the focus 
of attention so that he may the more readily grasp the 
new. The new material is then set before him or he is 
directed where to find it. He must observe carefully, ab- 
stract by comparison the common elements, and frame a 
general statement to fit the cases. His generalization is 
then applied to still other cases to verify it and to make 
the association automatic. This procedure gives us the 
famous ‘‘five formal steps of instruction’’ | preparation, 
presentation, comparison, generalization, and application. 
We are here concerned with the first four only. As was 
briefly noted above, these steps are not rigidly fixed, but 
may be varied as circumstances demand. Much of the 
criticism of them has arisen because of improper handling 
by teachers who were not thoroughly acquainted with the 
psychology back of them. Sometimes one step is so short 
as to be hardly noticeable, or again one step may occupy 
several days. The whole process may be finished in a 
few minutes in some lessons and take days in another. 
What are the principal things a teacher should do under 
the different steps? What things should she avoid? What 
shall the supervisor look for, and what devices shall he 
use to better the teacher’s procedure in this type of lesson? 
Preparation.—As the name of the first step indicates, it 
prepares the learner for the work to come. It usually has 
three phases, or three things to accomplish, namely, arous- 
ing interest, recalling old ideas with which to interpret 
the new, stating the aim.
-P-A-G-E-123
  LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 103 
1. Arousing interest. Here is the first application of 
the general principle of learning discussed in the section 
on Motive in Chapter IV, the relation of interest and at- 
tention to learning. It will suffice to summarize here from 
that discussion. The teacher must obtain clear, undivided 
attention to, or interest in, the lesson, either by appealing 
to the instinctive interests of the pupils or by bringing 
them to a realization of their need of and use for the sub- 
ject matter. In appealing to natural interests she must 
be careful to see that attention is not directed to other 
phases of the subject than the one she wishes to teach. For 
specific examples of attention-getting devices re-read the 
discussion in Chapter III and in some of the references 
there. 
2. Recalling the necessary old knowledge. Here again 
is the application of a general psychological principle, ap- 
perception. Briefly summarizing from the discussion in 
the section on Apperception in Chapter IV, the individual 
tends to interpret in terms of past experience that with 
which he comes in contact. If‘he has no past experience 
related to the new, he is likely to make a mistaken associa- 
tion and get a mistaken notion. The teacher must be adept 
in knowing the range of pupils’ information and in calling 
to the forefront of consciousness what is necessary for 
understanding what is to come. If she thinks the pupils 
do not have the information necessary, or if she discovers 
after the lesson is under way that most of them do not, 
she must supply the background as rapidly as possible. 
3. The aim. The word ‘‘aim’’ used promiscuously 
and without further definition is misleading and is re- 
sponsible for some of the difficulties experienced in plan- 
ning and discussing lessons. There are in the main three 
uses of the word: the teacher’s general aim; the teacher’s 
specific aim; the children’s aim. The first two are state- 
ments in terms of subject matter of what the teacher is
-P-A-G-E-124
  104 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
going to do. The latter is a statement of what the children 
are going to do. The children’s aim and the teacher’s 
specific aim are usually statements of the same thing from 
different points of view. 
The teacher’s general aim is sometimes, though rarely, 
just a statement of the subject to be taught. More com~ 
monly it is a statement of a unit of subject matter which 
is large enough to occupy some time in covering it. The 
teacher’s specific aim is a statement of what is to be done 
in one day, or one lesson. As for instance: 
Teacher’s Aim.—General: To teach the multiplication tables. 
Specific: To drill on table of 4’s.. 
In some cases in which a topic occupies a class for some 
time the specific aim becomes somewhat general and is in 
turn divided into smaller specifies for each day’s work, as 
in the following: 
Teacher’s Aim.—General: To teach the noun. 
Specific: Properties of the noun. (Monday, 
gender; Tuesday, number; Wednesday, 
nominative case.) 
The teacher’s specific aim must be stated in definite, 
concrete, simple, and brief terms. 
The correct wording and introduction of the children’s 
aim is one of the most important things in teaching. It 
eannot be emphasized too strongly that the children’s 
aim must be stated from the viewpoint of the learner. It 
is usually in the form of a question, though a direct state- 
ment of what is to be done is often sufficient. Whenever 
possible there should be a definite statement of the aim, 
but it sometimes happens that a lesson flows smoothly and 
correctly with no such direct statement. This is not wrong 
but is rarely necessary. Even in these cases there will be 
a statement in the preparation step that indicates what is 
going to be done. The principal purpose of the children’s 
aim is to set the thought processes of the learner to work
-P-A-G-E-125
    LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 105 
in the right direction. It should be the climax of the prep- 
aration step, whether arrived at in a few minutes or in 
half an hour. 
The skillful teacher will so manipulate her preparation 
that the children will ask a question that will contain the 
essence of the aim she desires to have them work upon. 
Under ideal conditions the pupils will bring forward aims 
or problems for study. There has been much discussion 
regarding the possibility or impossibility of working upon 
problems other than those discovered by one’s self. What- 
ever may be the theoretical aspects of this question, iv 
seems absurd to waste time debating the practical aspects. 
All around us are people working with willingness and 
interest, achieving real and important results, in tasks 
and problems discovered and set before the worker by 
another. A person can be so interested and inspired by 
another that he will take up important and arduous tasks 
he himself would never have discovered. It is true, 
of course, that people do work best upon problems they 
themselves feel to be vital. The practical guidance for the 
teacher is that she use the utmost skill to bring the learner 
to a realization of the problem in such way that he will 
feel that it is his own. It is not only legitimate, but ab- 
solutely necessary under practical conditions, for the 
teacher to so manipulate the situation that the learners 
feel that they discovered the problem themselves. 
The children’s aim must be problematic, attractive, con- 
crete, definite, simple, and brief. The following examples 
show briefly some devices in developing and stating aims. 
In an upper-grade class soon after the war, an item was 
read during the current-events period regarding the pro- 
posed sales tax and revised income tax, together with an- 
other item stating the amount of money necessary to pay 
a soldiers’ bonus. The teacher skillfully led a discussion 
in regard to the sources and collection of revenues in which
-P-A-G-E-126
  106 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
the pupils stated their opinions, usually what they had 
heard at home. It was evident that they possessed but 
the vaguest ideas regarding the details of levying and 
collecting taxes. In addition there was marked difference 
of opinion in regard to the few facts presented, and it was 
very easy to set up the aim, ‘‘Let us see how the Govern- 
ment gets its money.’? This was broken up into a number 
of smaller units relating to the school district, the town, 
the county, ete., and served as an.aim for the intensive 
study of taxation in the civics class. Because of the dif- 
ference of opinion at the start, and because of the teacher’s 
skill in utilizing concrete, everyday material, local prob- 
lems and sources of information, this somewhat dull topic 
was attacked with considerable interest. In like manner 
the history and development of the local street-car com- 
pany was studied. Later on the geography of Mexico was 
attacked in an endeavor to answer the question, ‘‘Should 
we endeavor to help Mexico by armed intervention or by 
education?’’ In these cases the pupils were led to differ 
and thus apparently discover a problem. It is to be noted 
that the first statement of the aim as given above does 
not contain all the necessary elements in a good aim. The 
smaller aims, however, were made concrete and definite. 
Sometimes it is only necessary to state the aim in order 
to focus interest at once and beget motive. The mere 
statement to a lower-grade class that they are going to 
write a story, or learn to read a piece, or dramatize a well- 
known rhyme in order to entertain another grade is 
usually sufficient. Statements in regard to making sleds, 
boats, bird houses, etc., will prove effective with inter- 
mediate boys. Advertisements from the daily papers, 
statements of figures and statistics can be used to motivate 
drill lessons. 
A problem already before one class can be utilized in 
another subject with the same class: ‘‘Let us read (name
-P-A-G-E-127
  
  LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 107: 
story) to see if it will help us in writing our story 
about ——.’’ 
A very common error in stating aims is to include two 
thoughts or problems, thus getting what is known as a 
double aim. Examples would be: ‘‘Let us see what damage 
the codling moth does and if we can eradicate it’’; ‘‘Let 
us find out how England oppressed the Colonies and how 
they won their freedom’’; and ‘‘Let us find out how Ponce 
de Leon searched for the Fountain of Youth and served 
Spain.”’ 
The aims in the following list are not perfect but may 
be suggestive. They are taken from actual lessons ob- 
served by classes in supervision. Some of them were to 
over several days’ work, others were for but one recitation; 
some of them were isolated, while others were parts of a 
series of lessons. The background for most of them. is 
obvious. They are taken from several subjects and grades 
and may be of help in suggesting others in various subjects. 
Let us see how the Central States can aid us in winning the 
war. 
‘Let us see why Russia wants India. 
Let us find out why the Missouri Compromise failed. 
How did Airlie (Oregon) get its name? 
Why did the Southern Pacific Railroad build a line into 
Marshfield (Oregon) ?

railroads? 
Why did England colonize in America? 
Let us find out if Roger Williams founded a liberal govern- 
ment in his colony (Rhode Island). 
Why does the Government insist that the soldier’s uniform 
be all wool? , 
Let us find out how the dandelion seed finds a new home. 
We are going to find out how the Eskimo builds his house. 
What effects do the pampas lands have on the industries of

Let us see how the colonists received the Stamp Act. 
Let us see how pigweed travels across the country. 
Let us see if it would pay McMinnville to buy a supply of 
good mountain water. 
After the aim has been stated, either of two pro- 
cedures may be followed. In one case there may be a 
discussion of the sources of information bearing on the 
problem, of methods of organizing data, of difficulties 
that will be met, ete. The aim may be broken up into 
smaller units and these units assigned to individuals or 
groups for reports. After thorough discussion of the prob- 
lem, methods of attack, etc., the class studies as usual at 
their seats, at home, or in the library. In this case the 
preparation step partakes of the nature of an assignment. 
The elaboration of the preparation step into an assignment 
lesson will be discussed in Chapter VIII. 
The second possibility is that, upon statement of the aim, 
the class starts immediately to work upon the problem 
under the guidance of the teacher. There may be the 
discussion and use of sources as a part of the class exer- 
cise, or material already in the possession of the children 
may be developed and reorganized. Thus the teacher is 
either guiding a supervised study procedure or following 
the so-called ‘‘developmental method’’ of presentation. 
Both lessons are sometimes called socialized recitations. 
The meaning and use of these terms will be found in Chap- 
ter XI. 
A point remains here that is a source of considerable 
eonfusion for beginning teachers or for older ones who 
have not fully broken away from textbook teaching. It 
is embodied in a question often asked during teachers’ 
meetings or in conferences: ‘‘How do you use the textbook 
if you teach according to this method?’’ The answer would 
seem to be that the teacher must have the lesson in mind 
as it is in the text and then look around for a connection
-P-A-G-E-129
LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 104 
  between it and the pupils’ everyday experiences and in. 
terests. Basing the preparation step on some concrete 
experience or real interest, she must then lead up to the 
material in the book. Sometimes it may be very difficult 
to find a connection, and sometimes it may seem a little 
far-fetched to the casual observer. Often material must 
be studied in a different order or form from that in the 
book. The text then is:introduced with the aim or assign- 
ment at the end of the preparation step. Study of the 
traditional type may follow, or the text may be used im- 
mediately in the class exercise. Ideally many texts and 
reference books should be utilized. 
A fairly certain index of a teacher’s skill is her ability 
to make smooth connections with the text material, which 
is but another way of stating the teacher’s task in the 
preparation step: arousing interest, recalling old knowl- 
edge, and developing an aim. 
Occasionally there is heard a minor criticism of lesson 
aims to the effect that they cannot be made to cover or 
bring into the lesson all the material called for by the 
course or text. For instance, an aim asking ‘‘how Spo- 
kane became a trade center’? might not seem to admit of 
discussion of Spokane’s public parks or her commission 
form of government, though it enables the teacher to bring 
in most of the important facts about the development of 
the city. Such a criticism detracts in no way from the 
great advantages that accrue from the use of aims. The 
material in any lesson that does not easily come under a 
good aim will be found to be small. Furthermore, it is 
easy to set up a secondary aim at the end of the series of 
lessons in order to bring in those things not already cov- 
ered, as, for instance, in the case cited: ‘‘Let us see how 
Spokane’s present goverpment differs from that of pioneer 
days.’’ 
The supervisor’s work in improving the preparation step
-P-A-G-E-130
110 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
lies in aiding the teacher in applying the principles in- 
volved in apperception, interest, and attention as discussed 
in the previous chapter. He can also render effective 
  service in assisting her to find and develop aims for dif-, 
ferent lessons. His work here is not limited to suggestion 
but should include demonstration teaching. 
Presentation.—In this step the new material is presented 
to the class. This statement must not lead anyone to sup- 
pose that the material is given to the pupil without effort 
on his part. As stated in the discussion of self-activity, 
the learning process is an active one and the pupil must 
always participate. The teacher skillfully sets the condi- 
tions, but the pupil must acquire the new material through 
his own efforts. 
It is not often in real life that a series of examples will 
be placed before the learner rapidly and consecutively as 
in the case of the lad and the cowboys. Months, or even 
years, might elapse before certain rules, generalizations, 
or abstract meanings were learned by experience. The 
school must present rapidly and effectively a number of 
specific examples so that the generalization may be arrived 
at quickly and correctly. Many teachers blunder here in 
presenting a large number of specifics that are practically 
alike. { The best procedure is rather to present one, or at 
‘most two or three, broadly typical illustrations, and then 
only such others as make clear the few points not empha- 
sized in the first ones. Too many examples usually con- 
fuse the mind. One occupies the focus of attention, and 
the mind makes excursions to others to note likeness or 
difference. Sometimes an illustration of the direct oppo- 
site will serve to make clear what is being taught. Any 
device of this nature is preferable to the mere multiplica- 
tion of illustrations. Care should be taken to secure suf- 
ficient, varied, typical examples. 
The well-known ‘‘type method’’ is based largely on the
-P-A-G-E-131
  
  LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 111 
psychological principles just explained. In place of taking 
the time in school to discuss a great many cities, river 
systems, geographical regions, transportation systems, etc., 
one example of each case is taken and studied in such detail 
that the normal individual can apply at once the general 
notion learned to any new cases. The type method is not 
a separate method, as some teachers apparently think, but 
an illustration of the type discussed here, namely, the 
learning of abstract meanings or, in the older terminology, 
of an inductive lesson. 
How then shall these new experiences be placed before 
the class for attack? A most important source of material 
and one of the best for thorough understanding is the past 
experience of the pupils. They have a great number of 
experiences that have not hitherto been organized into 
abstractions and generalizations. The latter constitute the 
new knowledge and the recounting and reorganizing of old 
knowledge is probably the best basis for them. Here again 
is an illustration of the developmental method or the social- 
ized recitation. 
Failing such a store of experience, the school must ap- 
proximate the real-life situation as closely as possible in 
giving the new material. Experimental work in the labo- 
ratory was an effort to meet this requirement, and poor as 
such work has been, the laboratory still presents a great 
opportunity to the teacher in presenting new matter. Pupils 
should perform the operations as a rule, but demonstrations 
must often be made by the teacher in the case of expensive 
materials or complicated processes. 
The excursion to mill, factory, farm, store, forest, lake, 
or beach is another device for presenting new material 
which, like the laboratory, is badly misused. An unorgan- 
ized excursion not only fails to give the pupil the material 
to be learned but has a detrimental effect upon routine 
and good order. Excursions should be used far more than 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
112 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  they are but should be definitely planned to the last detail. 
The teacher should go over the ground beforehand and 
make sure that everything is ready. Signals and move- 
ments should be definitely explained to the children. Indi- 
vidual assignments to different children in addition to the 
general assignment for all will help in maintaining atten- 
tion and order. There is more need for assigning carefully 
and exactly for an excursion than for a textbook lesson. 
When well organized the excursion is an exceptionally 
good teaching device, but the teacher who is weak in organ- 
ization and routine should not attempt it. 
Probably the most common way of presenting the new 
material will be to have the pupil read in his textbook or 
in references. This may be supplemented by the use of 
pictures, stories, real objects, graphs and curves, or dem- 
onstrations. The lecture method should be used very 
rarely, if at all, in the grades. Writing sentences or ex- 
amples on the blackboard or throwing illustrations upon 
a motion-picture screen are still other methods. The points 
in regard to presentation made in the preceding para- 
graphs apply to these latter methods as well. Even greater 
eare is necessary to make the illustrations sufficient, typical, 
and varied, because these methods are further from the 
real experience than are some of those discussed first. 
When the presentation step extends over any great 
length of time and when the pupils are engaged in some- 
what complicated analysis, they should be trained to stop 
and take stock occasionally. The aim should be recalled 
and the work summarized in an effort to see how much has 
been done to solve the problem, and how much remains 
to be done; not only the amount but the method of work 
should be scrutinized. This will aid in keeping the class 
on the main problem and in preventing digressions. 
To summarize the presentation step: The pupil should 
actively attack and analyze a number of varied and iypical
-P-A-G-E-133
LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 113 
‘illustrations of the generalization to be learned. The 
teacher may present these for his attack in any of several 
ways, seeking always to come as near to real. experiences 
on the part of the pupil as the nature of the material will 
permit. Outlines and summaries should be made from 
time to time in order to determine progress. 
Comparison.—An attempt to discuss what goes on during 
the process of comparison brings out clearly the point al- 
ready referred to a number of times, that the steps in 
lesson procedures are not fixed and rigid. The teacher 
who regards them as rigid is on the road to failure. It 
is correct to say that comparison began during the presen- 
tation step and continues on into the step of generalization. 
Rigidly and artificially we may think of the pupil as 
having the specific examples before him, discussing them 
fully, and then comparing to find the likenesses with which 
to make the general statement. But as a matter of fact 
the mind begins to generalize at once, on presentation of 
the first example. The common fault of ‘‘jumping at 
conclusions’’ is just this normal activity of the mind ar- 
riving at a conclusion without sufficient examination and 
comparison of data. In lists of sentences illustrating the 
parts of speech, in lists of spelling words presenting the 
same difficulty, or in lists of problems for teaching simple 
arithmetical processes, the similarity leading to the defini- 
tion or rule can be made to stand out very clearly. It is 
quickly grasped and there is little comparison as such. 
However, in the content subjects each specific illustra- 
tion might take several days to present, or they might even 
come in different parts of the course. In that case they 
must be called up together after each has been presented 
and a careful comparison made to determine the underly- 
ing likeness. Here is involved a difficult thought process, 
and one that distinguishes the real thinker from the in- 
dividual who is always wondering what it is all about. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  114 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Data had been before the human race for untold ages before” 
they were compared and generalized into the Darwinian 
theory. The same may be said of the Copernican theory. 
The specific examples were not alike in externals, they 
were scattered all over the world or out in space, but the 
great mind called them up together for comparison. A 
good example of this type of comparison is cited by Miss 
Earhart :* 
Thus the pupils in history who were studying the French 
Revolution found during the step of presentation that the 
French people had objected to long continued tyranny, and had 
set up a new government in which the rights of the people were 
to have more recognition than under the old form. In the step 
of comparison, they found that the English under Charles I had 
done the same; that the Americans under George III, and the 
Cubans under Spanish control, had worked for and attained 
similar results. They discovered tyranny on the part of all 
governments, various attempts to overcome it on the part of the 
people in each nation; and, as it happened in each of these 
eases, they found that the oppressive power was finally over- 
thrown after protracted struggle. 
Another example taken from American history could be 
made in a series of lessons teaching the section of the Con- 
stitution that relates to treason. The cases of Benedict 
Arnold, Aaron Burr, and Charles Lee could be recalled 
and examined in detail. They would be found to be alike 
in fundamentals, and references to the Constitution would 
show that the definition of treason and the provision for 
punishment embodies these fundamentals. In cases of 
comparison such as those cited here, there is need for or- 
ganization and summary as in the presentation step ; other- 
wise discussion will wander. 
The chief duty of the teacher is to refrain from doing

-P-A-G-E-135
Ree a ees ORT eee ne OE Re Te Te Re oe Ere one ee er re eel 
LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 115 
the work herself. If she makes the comparison, the learner 
is robbed of the opportunity to do the thinking involved. 
There is no need to present data carefully and elaborately 
unless the learner is going to exercise his mind upon them. 
Great skill is often required to direct the pupils to the 
essential points without telling or ‘‘giving it away.’’ Con- 
trasts are sometimes effective here as in the preceding step. 
Time, of course, is the big element in determining how 
elaborately the teacher may allow the pupil to follow his 
own route to the essentials. This leads directly to a con- 
sideration of the next step. 
Generalization—The pupil should formulate the result 
of his observation and comparison into a statement that 
will be a definition, rule, or some form of generalization. 
This process has been going on ever since the first observa- 
tion took place. Small children illustrate this continuous 
process of generalizing very well in learning about com- 
mon objects. The first definition of a dog, a cat, a table, 
a mama, is in terms of the first example, and many children 
are tenacious of the first specific idea, being slow to admit 
other specifies as being cases in point. This tendency to 
retain the specific in the generalization persists some little 
time in the grades, as shown by the child who stated that 
“Gravitation is when an apple falls off the tree.”’?’ A 
higher stage is reached when pupils themselves begin to 
introduce general terms. 
The utmost skill must be exercised by the teacher in aid- 
ing pupils to state and restate their findings until the 
definition is worked over into satisfactory terms. Many 
irrelevant and unwarranted suggestions will be made which 
must be rejected in an orderly and systematic way. The 
pupil should be led to correct his own mistakes if possible 
before the teacher resorts to dogmatic rejection. By suggest- 
ing implications or throwing in a new fact or two the teacher 
ean train in the suspension ef judgment. The class must    
-P-A-G-E-136
    116 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
be made to realize that judgment must wait until all data 
are in. There is always a great temptation to make the 
statement for the learner, or at least to speed it up. This 
must be scrupulously avoided unless the time element is 
really pressing. The crude results, the experimentation, 
the working over of the generalization are all vital parts 
of the learning process, and, as pointed out above, they 
must be done by the learner. Care should be taken, how- 
ever, that their part of the lesson does not degenerate into 
mere guessing, replacing worth while trial-and-error learn- 
ing. 
The teacher should step in and polish the statement, sup- 
plying the technical wording only when the class indi- 
cates clearly that it has grasped the underlying idea. 
Teachers are often impatient with the so-called funny 
answers of children and often blunder in refusing to con- 
sider the oddly worded statement. A class should not be 
expected to give the exact statement that is in the mind 
of the teacher. She must be flexible and quick enough in 
her thinking to realize that the proper idea is there even 
if the words are odd. The boy who said that the ‘‘the 
centaur is half infantry and half cavalry’’ made an odd 
but not an illogical statement. The foreign student who 
translated ‘‘The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak’’ 
into ‘‘The ghost is willing but the meat is feeble’’ had the 
idea if not the vocabulary. The statement that ‘‘Gravita- 
tion is that which if there were none we would all fall up 
into the air’’ indicates an understanding of the idea despite 
inability to phrase it correctly. These, of course, are ex- 
treme instances but they serve to emphasize the fact that 
the teacher must not expect or insist on a correctly worded 
statement. In some cases of peculiar answers the teacher 
and not the child is at fault, as in the ease of the boy who 
said that: ‘‘Lincoln had a woman make him some shirts 
from rails that he had split. They were hickory rails,
-P-A-G-E-137
LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 117 
hence hickory shirts.’? Probably insufficient or confused 
presentation had been made by the teacher and the pupil 
confused meanings and ideas. 
The supervisor should discuss difficult. cases of compari- 
son and generalization that he sees, showing the teacher 
how questions will aid and direct the class thinking. He 
should also demonstrate the use of outlines and summaries 
in checking progress and taking stock of work done. 
Application.—This step usually consists of an assignment 
of drill material. It may, however, involve a problem- 
solving (deductive) lesson or a series of such lessons as 
extensive and rich as those involved in the original learning 
of the generalization now being proved. 
Limitations of this Method of Teaching. — Many 
teachers feel that the somewhat lengthy process here out- 
lined for learning abstract meanings is a waste of time. 
Such an argument is based on a misunderstanding of the 
applications of the method. In many lessons the procedure 
is brief, though true to the thought process involved. It 
can be adapted to many lessons in the crowded programme 
of the rural school. In cases where it does take some time 
it is justifiable because in the end time will be saved on 
account of the better retention of material and the gain 
in the use of the process itself. Telling may be shorter 
at the time, but there is no guarantee of retention or under- 
standing. In many cases time is actually wasted in the 
end by the seemingly quicker lecture method. 
However, the method should not be used in the case of 
abstractions or rules so simple as to be grasped immediately 
upon explanation. Also the teacher should avoid wasting 
time in teaching at length a generalization that is already 
known to the class. Some normal graduates from schools 
where this method is improperly exploited seem to have 
the idea that any piece of subject matter can be treated 
thus. Obviously this is absurd. Only material that leads
-P-A-G-E-138
  118 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
to laws, rules, definitions, principles, or generalizations of 
one sort or another is susceptible of such organization. 
Much material is never carried further than the presen- 
tation step. The other illustrations and the abstract prin- 
ciple itself may be so remote as to be non-essential. The 
presentation of pictures, the telling of stories, the study 
of common objects are all examples of material that in- 
volves only preparation and presentation. In some cases, 
of course, such as the lessons quoted above from Harhart 
or with a series of stories, there will be a series of lessons 
involving the first two steps and then a comparison exercise 
later on. 
ProsiemM SoLvine 
The acquisition of abstract meanings and the making of 
generalizations is, however, but one of the phases of re- 
flective thinking. There is also the application of these 
general ideas to puzzling situations. Sometimes both the 
general idea and the case to be solved are quite simple, as, 
for instance, applying rules in arithmetic to a page of 
problems or applying newly learned grammatical defini- 
tions in the task of filling in correctly a page of incomplete 
sentences. Such exercises are commonly known as drill 
lessons and will be treated separately in Chapter VII. 
We are here concerned with those deductive exercises itt 
which the specific case to be solved is not clear and must 
be analyzed in detail, or in which the general law to apply 
is not immediately apparent. In some cases both difficul- 
ties will be presented at once. The problematic individual 
must be studied and analyzed most carefully, while several 
generalizations must be experimentally applied. Such 
problems as ‘‘Why is it cheaper to ship by water than by 
rail?’’ introduce pupils to principles and laws that are 
unknown to them though more or less obvious to the adult.
-P-A-G-E-139
    LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 119 
Another of the same nature would be, ‘‘Why can New 
Zealand sell butter more cheaply in Portland, Oregon, than 
ean the Oregon dairymen?’’ 
How does the mind go about solving such a problem? 
Just as a generalization comes to mind almost immediately 
upon presentation of the first illustration, so here an an- 
swer or guess is formulated as soon as the problem is 
thoroughly understood. The individual then casts about 
him for information with which to disprove or uphold his 
hypothesis. He may examine the problem closely, or he 
may turn to his own past experience, or he may examine 
any promising source of information. A difference between 
good and bad thinking may be pointed out here. The poor 
thinker is satisfied with the first information he meets or 
with a haphazard solution which brings him to grief later. 
The careful thinker suspends his judgment, even in the 
face of seeming certainty, until the analysis of the problem 
and the search for information are completed. He may 
even wait until verification by experiment is under way 
before fully accepting an answer. The implications for 
teaching are obvious. The inspection of the problem, the 
gathering of data, and the formulation of probable out- 
comes go hand in hand, no line being sharply drawn be- 
tween the three. The systematic organization of data as 
they are discovered and applied to the tentative solution 
narrows the search more and more. In those cases where 
verification consists in garnering still more data, this fourth 
process is intimately interwoven with the others. Where it 
involves experimentation, computation, or the analysis of 
implications, it is then set off more sharply. 
The problem-solving process, or so-called deductive les- 
son, is, then, organized into four steps: problem, inspection, 
inference, verification. All that has been said about flexi- 
bility and interrelation of steps in the process of acquiring 
abstractions is of even greater importance in considering 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
    120 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
problem solving. In some of the former lessons the steps 
can be made to stand apart, but in the problem-solving 
exercises the movement is, as Dewey has called it, ‘‘shuttle- 
like.’? There is a constant movement back and forth: 
data are gathered, they affect the hypothesis, a little veri- 
fication movement is started to confirm or eliminate the 
data, further search is made, and the process repeats itself. 
For this reason there is great need for taking stock occa- 
sionally, for organizing data as they are discovered and 
used. Great care must be taken in this matter, since all 
sequence and relation to the problem will be lost unless out- 
lines, graphs, tables, or other devices are used to organize. 
What shall the teacher do in each of these steps in order 
to enable the pupil to engage actively in problem-solving 
activity? How shall she give the class opportunity to do 
active analytic thinking? What things must she avoid? 
What are the supervisory problems involved? 
Problem.—A better but less well-known name for this 
step is the ‘‘approach.’’? Hither of the two names is used 
in order to avoid confusion with ‘‘preparation’’ as used 
in the other process. In this step the class is brought to 
a clear realization of the problem in much the same manner 
that it was prepared for work in the preparation step. 
The interest is aroused, old knowledge recalled, and an aim 
developed. The embodiment in the aim of the real prob- 
lem is more difficult than is the statement of the aim in the 
acquisition of abstract meanings. Otherwise the discussion 
of the elements in the preparation step as given in the 
preceding chapter applies almost exactly and need not be 
repeated here. 
Inspection.—During this phase of the lesson the prob- 
lem is thoroughly inspected. This involves Observation 
and analysis of the puzzling situation together with a 
search for related information. As in the acquisition of 
meanings, the work must be done by the pupil. The
-P-A-G-E-141
LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 121 
teacher may assist by indicating sources of material, or by 
focusing attention upon aspects of the situation that are 
not immediately noticeable, but if learning is to take place, 
pupil activity must dominate. 
In his Methods of Teaching in High School, Parker sum- 
marizes the ways in which the teacher may assist as: (1) 
analyzing the problem or picking it to pieces; (2) stimu- 
lating the formulation of hypotheses and the recall of 
general principles that might be applicable. Thorndike 
on the same topic says that the teacher may assist by: (1) 
systematizing the search; (2) reducing alternatives; (3) 
suggesting a useful alternative; (4) suggesting conse- 
quences. All of these, obviously, will lead to a mone care- 
ful examination of the problem. 
Here more than ever there must be organization of data. 
The pupil must form the habit of looking back over what 
has been accomplished, of ‘‘sizing up the situation.’’ This 
will make for systematic discussion of information re- 
ported, of the suggestions and hypotheses, and of methods 
of verification. Suggestions and inferences may have to be 
held in mind for some time in complicated problems until 
more information is found or until a lengthy process of 
verification is finished. 
The concrete applications of these general statements 
can be seen in the procedure of the class that worked upon 
the problem stated above regarding the price of New 
Zealand butter in Portland, Oregon. The pupils themselves 
evolved the method of inspection and suggested the fol- 
lowing things for investigation: the climate, area avail- 
able, and labor costs in both places; supply and demand; 
transportation routes and costs; quality of product and 
laws relating to making and selling dairy products; laws 
relating to the entry of products from another country; 
ete. These, together with others suggested, were given 
definite problematic statement and assigned to groups of
-P-A-G-E-142
  122 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
individuals for examination and report. Magazines and 
books were searched, letters written for bulletins or detailed 
information, reports made, and data organized and re- 
viewed from time to time. Motivation was supplied for 
work in geography, both new and review, for oral and 
written composition, for reading and library work. The 
civics class was even called into action duying the discus- 
sion of laws and tariffs. An excellent pjece of research 
was done with little guidance from the tedcher. 
Another problem, ‘‘Let us see if the 
pendence and Monmouth is suitable for growing sugar 
beets,’’ was solved in much the same way. This was a real 
problem in the communities mentioned since an extensive 
hop industry had been eliminated and no one know what to 
substitute. Samples of soil were taken from various fields 
of different elevations, exposures, and drainage conditions 
and sent to the agricultural college for analysis. The 
method of sugar-making was reported in detail, together 
with the amount of capital necessary, the probable market, 
and a brief history of sugar-beet enterprises in the West.” 
Inference.—As stated in the beginning of this section, 
the steps are interwoven rather intimately and cannot be 
separated except in simple problems and for short lengths 
of time. The making of inferences, like the making of 
the generalization, starts almost as soon as the problem 
arises. In fact, most people think of an answer first and 
then work to prove or disprove. 
The teacher’s skill will be shown in the way that infer- 
ence is called for when sufficient information is in sight 
to justify it. The principle of self-activity is again promi- 
nent; the pupil must make the inferences himself even 
      
2It may be noted in passing that such lessons as the two outlined 
above are referred to by some writers as ‘‘projects.’’ The discussion 
in Chapter X will make clear the intimate relationship between the 
older lesson types, familiar to most teachers, and the project.

though he plagues the teacher with seemingly irrelevant 
guesses and suggestions. Rather than reject these state- 
ments, she should lead the pupil to criticize them himself. 
Questions involving implications or verification of what 
has been said are good devices. The reduction of irrelevant 
suggestions to the absurd is more difficult, of course, in 
the case of reflective thinking than in the case of motor 
activity. One member of a class making motor-boat models 
was unusually set in his determination to make his boat 
his own way and would listen to suggestions from none. 
Visits to the river for the observation of larger boats 
seemed to have little effect. Though he pursued his project 
enthusiastically and worked hard, his boat had one fatal 
defect—it would not remain right side up when placed in 
the water upon completion. Thereafter he was much better 
as a coworker with other boys in the class. The teacher 
must also be on the alert for suggestions logically somewhat 
justified in the child’s mind but which do not aid in the 
work on hand. Such suggestions must be disposed of by 
explanation instead of by dogmatic rejection. 
Verification.—When an inference has been settled upon 
as the one most likely to be true, it should be proved. Some- 
times verification is as simple as applying it immediately in 
a new situation similar to the one that produced it. In 
other cases it may take as long to prove the hypothesis as to 
find it. It may involve lengthy experiments, the gathering 
of much new data, writing of letters, or consulting of author- 
ities. References may be made to books, other people, ete.

Self-Activity—Mention has been made from time to | 
time of the necessity of arousing real self-activity during 
learning, and the following striking statement from Strayer 
will be sufficient here to reémphasize the point: * 
The element which needs most emphasis in deductive (prob- 
lem-solving) teaching is the realization on the part of the 
teaeher that the success of the process is directly proportional 
to the independence with which the pupil discovers for himself 
that which is essential in the situation under consideration, his 
attempt to fit or relate the particular case to the principle or 
generalization by which it will be explained, and his willingness, 
when he discovers his error by an attempted verification, to 
repeat the process. We do not think logically by having some- 
one else do our thinking for us, nor is our growth measured by 
the uniformity with which we hit upon the correct solution of 
the problem at the first attempt. Rather we may measure suc- 
cess by the power of our pupils to criticize the reasoning which 
appears plausible until carefully scrutinized, and by their 
readiness to retrace their steps and to search for firmer ground 
when they have of their own accord given up a scheme of rea- 
soning which has proved invalid, 
Individuality versus Authority.—It will be observed 
everywhere in school, from the primary grades to the col- 
lege, that some individuals manifest at different times and 
in different ways an astonishing lack of self-direction. They 
seem unable to proceed on their own initiative, or to do the 
simplest things without explicit direction. At the other 
extreme will be observed the individuals who manifest an 
impertinent independence, which in college often develops 
into stupid arrogance. 
The first type is illustrated by the children who seem 
unable to look up words unless directed to do so, to start 
work unless the directions are minutely explicit, to find the

place to sit, stand, or work without being told over and 
over again. College students will often ask an instructor, 
“Now just what is it you want in this paper you have 
assigned?’’ They excuse a failure with the wail, ‘‘Well, if 
I’d only known what you wanted, I would have done it that 
way.’’ There seems to be no thought of initiative, inde- 
pendent thought, or expression of individuality. The 
school, of course, is in a great measure to blame for this 
attitude, since much administration and instruction is of 
such nature as to produce just this condition. But it is a 
relic of the Middle Ages and of mistaken theological ideas 
regarding the nature of the individual. Studies of original 
nature, of individual difference and variation, have shown 
the vast importance of training the individual for what he 
is. The individual’s contribution will be made in terms of, 
and because of, the particular talent or ability he may 
possess. Modern psychology and pedagogy have stressed 
this fact for some time now. Progress seems to be served 
by individual contributions. Individuality is a benefit to 
the group rather than otherwise. A very readable summary 
of this topic will be found in McMurry, How to Study and 
Teaching How to Study, Chapter X of that book containing 
many practical suggestions. There can be no doubt that 
interest will be generated and work more keenly motivated 
if there is provision for individual initiative and expres- 
sion. Accomplishment will be greater, and habits and view- 
points valuable both in and out of school will be acquired. 
But we have also the other side of the situation to deal 
with. The spoiled child is famous everywhere for imper- 
tinence to parent and teacher, for disregard of others’ 
rights, and for inability to respect any authority in any 
line. A teacher of psychology once addressed a college 
class on a difficult and little understood phase of the sub- 
conscious, and called for class discussion afterwards. The 
first remark by a sophomore student was, ‘‘It stands to   
t 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
  126 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
reason that a good deal of this isn’t true.’? On another 
occasion a college junior was assigned an article by one of 
the most eminent thinkers in America, and reported to his 
instructor confidentially that ‘‘The article is bunk. The 
author must be a poor nut with a warped view of life!’’ 
Another senior who had never taken psychology, had never 
heard of intelligence examinations or of experimental 
psychology, was given an intelligence test much like the 
army tests and later expressed himself at great length orally 
and in the college paper upon the absurdity of such exam- 
inations. All of these students were blithely unaware of 
the extreme stupidity of their opinions. All around us are 
men expressing opinions, and acting upon them, in regard 
to affairs they do not understand and never can. In street 
ears, in hotel lobbies, in offices, at social gatherings, every- 
where that people meet, the humblest clerks will be heard 
expressing emphatic opinions in contradiction of experts 
who have worked in the particular field for a lifetime. By 
some this tendency is mistakenly called ‘‘ American inde- 
pendence.’’ Certain it is that no other nation would claim 
it as a trait, and good Americans must disclaim it. It is not 
maintained that the expert is infallible, but it can be main- 
tained that in case of difference between the average citi- 
zen and the expert, the chances are probably one thousand 
to one that the expert is right. In a field where experts 
are available and have demonstrated their expertness, there 
is no occasion for so-called independent thinking by the 
average individual. However, no one wishes blind worship 
of authority, of dicta from above, or undue worship of the 
pronouncements of the oracle. The bad effects of unthink- 
ing acceptance of propaganda from supposed experts have 
been thoroughly demonstrated, not only in Germany, but in 
America and other countries as well. Respect for author- 
ity can be perverted sometimes to further the selfish pur- 
poses of designing and unscrupulous leaders. The proper,
-P-A-G-E-147
LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 127 
absolutely necessary, and vital display of independent 
thought is to be exercised in discovering who the experts 
are, and what makes them expert; in analyzing the evidence 
set forth, and in determining whether pronouncements 
made: are really made by experts or by self-interested 
individuals posing as experts. 
Between the two extremes, then, there is a desirable 
type of individuality, initiative, and independence which 
should be trained to the utmost. These traits are not mani- 
fested, however, as some seem to think, in impertinent dif- 
ference of opinion, in stubborn obstinacy, but in the rigor- 
ous suspension of judgment, in the careful and exhaustive 
search for data, in critical analysis of these data, and in the 
insistence upon reasonable verification. Thorndike believes 
that independence is not unreadiness to obey, but the 
tendency to contribute more than is called for; not refusal 
to believe, but the tendency to examine carefully the basis 
of the opinion. Initiative is not unwillingness to codperate, 
but the readiness and ability to speed up, or to go ahead 
working along lines of intelligently determined thought and 
action.* 
The lessons involving reflective thought seem to afford 
some of the best opportunities for training these desirable 
traits. The elements in the thought process can be made 
clear. It can be shown that authorities are entitled to 
respect because of the exhaustive, verifiable evidence upon 
which their conclusions rest. The learner can be taught to 
choose his authorities on the basis of impartial, objective, 
precise, verifiable evidence, and that he may differ with these 
experts only on the basis of a critical examination of their

data and inferences. New evidence, an error in the old 
evidence, or a fallacy in the reasoning process must be found 
before intelligent difference of opinion can arise. Differ- 
ences of opinion or expression of opinion based upon hopes, 
fears, desires, emotions, whims, prejudices, personal inter- 
ests, superstitions, or what not, cannot be regarded as com- 
mendable expressions of independent thinking or of indi- 
viduality, but rather as expressions of the direct opposite. 
Suspended Judgment: the Critical Evaluation of Data, 
Sources, and Proof.—Mention has been made from time 
to time of the necessity for suspending judgment while 
gathering data and making proof; of the critical evaluation 
of statements and processes. Dewey states that the essence 
of thinking is just this point, and it is undoubtedly true 
that dreadful blunders are made and disasters precipitated 
because of the unwillingness or the inability of the average 
citizen to examine patiently all phases of situations before 
acting. Dewey says:* 
. . . the difference, par excellence, between good and bad think- 
ing is found at this point . . . Reflective thinking is always more 
or less troublesome . . . it involves willingness to endure a con- 
dition of mental unrest . . . it means judgment suspended during 
inquiry, and suspense is likely to be somewhat painful ... The 
most important factor in training good mental habits consists in 
acquiring the attitude of suspended conclusions and in mastering 
the various methods of searching for new materials to corroborate 
er to refute the first suggestions that occur. To maintain the 
state of doubt and to carry on systematic and protracted inquiry 
. . . these are the essentials of thinking. 
A common fault with teachers is dogmatically to reject 
or accept answers made by pupils, or to take a stand upon 
disciplinary questions and refuse to consider further evi- 
dence. This tends to stifle any thinking that might be done, 
  
*John Dewey, How We Think, New York, 1910, pp. 12 and 13. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  LESSONS INVOLVING REFLECTIVE THOUGHT 129 
and to set up instead the arbitrary, dogmatic mental atti- 
tude in the pupils. As far as time permits the teacher 
must school herself to endure patiently the ‘‘more or less 
troublesome, somewhat painful condition of mental unrest’’ 
involved in good thinking in order that the pupil may 
obtain all possible exercise in thinking. ‘ 
Skillful discussion of conflicting evidence quoted by dif- 
ferent pupils is an excellent device in training for complete 
inquiry under suspended judgment. 
Individual Difference—We have emphasized earlier 
that the pupil must do the thinking. This is true, and so 
far as time permits, all should be given an opportunity to 
work out problems and to think through to generalizations. 
Obviously there must be much time allowed for trial and 
error, for gathering data, for inspecting problems, for con- 
sulting authorities or other forms of proof. Schools are not 
so organized that an ideal amount of time can be given for 
all to do this, but every opportunity possible must be ob- 
tained for the slow thinkers to do some thinking, even if 
such opportunities are very few. They cannot learn other- 
wise. The fast thinker, the bright pupil, can learn much 
by following the teacher through a problem, or from 
organizing material found in the texts and references. 
Group lessons with individual assignments are a good de- 
vice to provide everyone, in proportion to his ability, an 
opportunity to participate. In assigning and questioning 
the teacher must distribute opportunities for thinking so 
that both types of pupils get all the opportunities that time 
will allow. : 
Organizing the Material of Thinking.—Lack of organ- 
ization often handicaps an otherwise intelligent individual. 
Many people really know a great deal about a subject but 
are so incoherent that they can neither use the facts them- 
selves nor impart them to anyone else. One of the most 
common reasons for getting off the problem, getting lost
-P-A-G-E-150
q jj 
  130 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
during a lesson, for wandering in a discussion, is the lack 
of some scheme of organization. It should be borne in mind 
that organization is not classification. It is not the group- 
ing of a great number of facts under heads and sub-heads 
supplied by teacher or text. It is not the writing of a cum- 
bersome, detailed, and useless notebook. It is not even 
logical sequence in some cases. The pupil should be stim- 
ulated to stop and clean house occasionally. Some material 
gathered and noted can be dispensed with, and some can be 
replaced or reémphasized. Rough outlines should be made 
in terms of the pupil’s ideas, rather than on a prescribed 
form. Underlining in the text is superior to taking notes 
in many cases. Graphs, outlines, and charts are efficacious 
devices for keeping the thinking process on the problem; 
they assist in rejecting related but unimportant suggestions, 
in systematizing the search, and in indicating how far the 
class has come and what remains to be done. 
SUMMARY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
The outlines for the guidance of observations on lessons 
involving thought include only those questions relating 
directly to the particular process involved and refer only 
incidentally to the general principles of learning active at 
different times. For guidance with the latter the super- 
visor should refer to the questions at the end of Chapter IV.

pupils? 
Preparation 
1. Does the teacher “set the stage”: 
(a) By calling up related ideas, or by supplying necessary 
background for interpreting the new? 
(b) By arousing the proper mental attitude, either through 
use of the pupils’ instinctive interests, or by means 
of the intrinsic worth of the subject matter? 
(c) By the statement of a clear-cut, concise aim, indicating 
the line of activity, mental or motor, for the coming 
period? 
2. Is the aim set by the teacher, or made to grow out of a sit- 
uation developed by her so that the pupils feel the prob- 
lem to be theirs? 
3. Does the teacher check to see that all have and understand 
the aim? 
Presentation 
Possible methods of presenting the new are: developing 
pupil experiences; lecturing or telling stories; having 
pupils report readings, observe experiments, make excur- 
sions; presenting pictures or objects. 
1. Is the method used the one best fitted to the subject matter? 
Was it properly administered? 
2. Are the examples given sufficient, avoiding extremes of too 
many or too few? Are they varied? Do they involve 
pupil experience? Do they show clearly the element to 
be abstracted and generalized? Are contrasts effectively 
used ? 
3. Does the teacher provide for active aggressive analysis by 
the pupils? Distribute opportunity to contribute in rela- 
tion to ability? 
4, Does she guide pupils in evaluating statements found? In 
criticizing their own suggestions? In discriminating be- 
tween conflicting arguments? Does she herself manifest 
suspended judgment in dealing with pupils? 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    132 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
5. Does she stimulate the class to be systematic and orderly, to 
take stock occasionally? Does she stay on the topic her- 
self? 
6. If the presentation is not finished within the period is there 
definite provision for reopening the discussion or for out- 
side work? 
Comparison 
1. Does the teacher refrain from doing this herself? Show 
skill in guiding pupils to proper comparisons without 
‘‘oiving it away’’? Are contrasts introduced if neces- 
sary? 
2. Is she alert to see from pupils’ statements that in some 
eases she has made insufficient presentation? 
| 
Generalization 
1. Does the teacher show skill and patience in guiding pupils 
through a series of crude, poorly worded formulations 
toward the completed definition? 
2. Does she wait patiently until they indicate clearly that they 
have grasped the underlying idea, before she supplies the 
technical name or wording? 
3. Does she, on the other hand, avoid a standstill in the learn- 
ing process while trying to stimulate the class to for- 
mulate the statement? 
4. Does she differentiate wisely between lessons that require 
exact scientific definitions and those that do not?

OBSERVATION OUTLINE IN TERMS oF PupPrL AcTIvVITY 
‘Again let it be emphasized that a real lesson is one con- 
tinuous thinking process and is not divided rigidly into 
steps as some normal schools would have it. The following 
division into steps is solely for ease of organization and 
reference. The supervisor will observe a continuous piece 
of learning, actively participated in by the pupils and 
energized by their purposes rather than by those of the 
teacher. Any phase of the thinking process may be seen 
at any part of the lesson.

ceding chapter are not referred to directly in the lesson

sonal experiences, by gathering and stating information 
from books, magazines, encyclopedias, other people, ete.?

CHAPTER VI 
LESSONS INVOLVING IMITATION: THE ACQUISITION OF ARBITRARY 
ASSOCIATIONS AND OF MOTOR SKILLS 
There are a great number of lessons to be learned in 
school, a great many activities to be participated in by the 
pupil that do not involve reflective thinking as the principal 
factor. While thinking and individual variation enter in, 
these exercises involve mainly imitation of a model. Some- 
times they take the form of learning or making automatic 
the arbitrary association of symbol and meaning; some- 
times the acquisition of a motor skill; in still others a com- 
bination of both. 
The learning of arbitrary associations is illustrated in the 
multiplication tables, silent reading, spelling, dates and 
events in history, use of globes, maps, and charts in geog- 
raphy, etc. The acquisition of motor skill is chiefly involved 
in learning to write, in manual training and shopwork, in 
physical training and athletics, singing, drawing, etc. Com- 
binations of both processes will be found in dramatization, 
in expressive reading, in memorizing poetry, in the formal 
side of composition, in the learning of foreign languages, 
ete. 
_ Enthusiasts in some of the more esthetic fields mentioned 
above may disagree that. the imitation of a model is the 
chief thing involved in their work. But it is to be noted 
that there is ample room for the expression of individuality 
and for legitimate variation within the limits set by the 
requirements of models that exemplify the best methods of 
doing certain things. 
141 
   
-P-A-G-E-162
  
  142 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Steps in the Process.—What do people do in learning 
arbitrary facts or in acquiring skills that are by their 
nature fixed and dogmatic? What are the steps one goes 
through in making the arbitrary associations into automatic 
reactions or in acquiring useful motor reactions? The first 
step is usually to get a clear and exact idea of what is to be 
done. This may be obtained from a book or other printed 
set of directions; it may be had from other people either 
by explanation or demonstration. In short, the learner gets 
clearly before him a model, plan, or formula which he at- 
tempts to imitate. He may, and probably should, par- 
ticipate in the setting-up of the model. Even where the 
model is the crystallized result of experiment and experi- 
ence he should be free to ask questions on points that are 
not immediately clear. During the imitation the teacher 
may give further instructions or demonstrations, may make 
verbal criticisms or lead the pupil to criticize his own 
results. In some instances improvement will come through 
trial and error, in others by volitional effort exercised 
directly upon the difficult part. This process of imitation 
and criticism is kept up until greater and greater facility is 
attained. Even after the model can be imitated with a good 
degree of accuracy, practice must ensue to make the associa- 
tion or skill automatic and permanent. 
The steps in this type of lesson would then seem to be: 
setting the model, imitation, criticism, drill. These steps 
are not mutually exclusive but are interwoven rather in- 
timately. In one case a step may be prolonged, while in 
another all the steps may be completed in a short time. 
Some teachers are misled by the apparent dissimilarity of 
many school tasks and do not believe that the problems 
involved can be summarized in groups indicated in the 
steps set forth above. On analysis, however, does it not 
seem that the high-school boy learning to drop kick and 
the high-school girl learning to hemstitch present to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  | LESSONS INVOLVING IMITATION 143 
teacher a series of similar problems? Coach or teacher sets 
before the learner what is regarded as the best and most 
economical method of procedure, that is, sets the model. 
The learner then imitates and is corrected by demonstration 
or verbal direction. Practice follows until facility is gained. 
Undoubtedly the two models will differ completely, there 
are all sorts of variations in detail, but the task of the 
teacher in each case is to find and set before the learner the 
very best way of doing the thing. Criticism and correction 
of the learner’s attempts must then be made in accord with 
‘psychology as applied to the particular task in hand. The 
teacher’s knowledge of apperception and individual differ- 
ences. and her understanding of children’s interests and 
motor development are all called into play. But however 
intricate and different in detail the processes may be of 
teaching people to give expressive readings, to bunt a base- 
ball, to learn a poem, to copy a painting, or to build things 
on the sand table, the problems in each case can be organ- 
ized into related groups and summarized under the steps 
set forth above. The questions relating to finding and 
setting the model, to criticizing the imitation, to direction 
of trial-and-error learning, to verbal directions and actual 
demonstrations, will send teacher and coach alike on the 
search for the answers that apply in the particular fields 
involved. What then are some of the things that should 
properly be done in each of these steps? What procedures 
are evidence of good teaching and what indicate a lack 
of understanding of the process by the teacher? What are 
the questions that will be asked the supervisor? 
Setting the Model.—It is sometimes argued that since the 
facts dealt with in this type of lesson are fixed and arbi- 
trary, there is no need to recall old knowledge to aid in 
interpretation. It is further stated that because of the 
nature of the material, there can be little interest aroused 
‘and therefore little attention to motive and aim is neces- 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
t 
144 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
sary. As a matter of fact, the recall of old knowledge is very 
necessary and can very well be made to supply both under- 
Standing and motive. To make pupils keenly aware of their 
andicap in lacking a certain formula or skill is a good 
preparation for setting the model before them. Natural 
interests can be appealed to just as in the lessons involving 
thought. The mere statement to a lower-grade class that 
they are going to make May baskets to hang on the doors 
will motivate for most children an otherwise dogmatic 
exercise in paper cutting and folding. Practicing expressive 
reading for the purpose of entertaining another grade is 
effective. Much material of this type can be worked into 
games of one sort or another though care must be taken to 
See that the game really drills the association or skill being 
learned. Usually the aim, if one is stated, is merely a state- 
ment of what is to be done. It can be made to grow out of © 
a discussion, however, as in the lessons discussed in the last 
chapter. 
_ In setting the model for a motor activity there are three 
questions, attention to which will materially aid the teacher. 
First, is there one best way of doing this thing, backed 
by good evidence, or are there several ways equally 
good? Second, shall the whole procedure be presented at 
once and the class required to imitate it in that way or may 
it be broken up into parts for special attention? Third, 
how much use shall be made of actual demonstration of the 
skill and how much of verbal directions? 
1. Best methods. In most fields the experience of ex- 
perts indicates that there are certain ways of doing things 
that are most effective and economical, though in music and 
drawing there is considerable disagreement as to these best 
methods. Individuals may be found who are certain that 
saws, planes, pens, needles, ete., may be handled in any of 
several ways, but there can be no doubt that energy is use- 
lessly expended and time lost through lack of attention to 
   
-P-A-G-E-165
LESSONS INVOLVING IMITATION 145 
this phase of motor learning. In addition, mistakes that do 
not educate the learner will be made in struggling with 
different methods in an attempt to determine the right one. 
A danger in regard to this matter is pointed out by 
Thorndike: + 
A... danger in teaching form is to exaggerate the impor- 
tance of some particular way of doing a thing and to spend 
much of the time and effort that ought to be given to concrete 
execution in insistence upon rigid adherence to some method. 
If we knew the one best way to write, the one right way to 
sing and the like, the devotion of much time to form could well 
be pardoned. But in fact the way a child takes of his own 
initiative may be nearly as good a way for him as the method 
his teacher devotes weeks to enforcing. A moderate skepticism 
about methods of securing proper form in motor accomplish- 
ments is healthy. As in reasoning many different processes 
may all reach the same conclusion, so in motor skill many dif- 
ferent ways of doing a thing may be equally good, one way 
being the best for some and another way best for others. 
Much has been done since the above was written in 1905 
along the lines of determining experimentally and by ex- 
pert observation the best methods of performing certain 
acts, making necessary an even more ‘‘moderate skepticism 
about methods of securing form.’’ However, two valuable 
points are included in the quotation. Many teachers devote 
so much time to insisting that margins be the requisite num- 
ber of sixteenths of an inch wide on compositions and devote 
so much time to the position of the fingers in writing that 
little writing is done. Secondly, the allowance for indi- 
vidual differences is vital. 
2. Whole vs. part of the movement. Ordinarily it is 
best to practice the whole movement at once and as a whole, 
though this seems in contradiction to everyday observation. 
In lengthy or complicated skills, however, it is often eco- 
  
1K. L. Thorndike, Principles of Teaching, 1906, p. 221.
-P-A-G-E-166
    146 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
nomical to break the model into several units or to isolate 
a part for special practice. Care must be exercised in this 
to see that greater damage is not done by setting up wrong 
associations which make it difficult to work the special piece 
back into the big movement. 
3. Demonstration vs. verbal directions. The compara- 
tive value of these two factors is shown in the statement 
of the young teacher who was in despair over the failure of 
her class to do well in manual work: ‘‘I just can’t get my 
pupils to do things right. I explain and explain but of the 
three who do the best work, two are deaf and one can’t 
understand English!’’ Thorndike says on the same point: ? 
The chief danger in teaching form is the neglect of imita- 
tion. There are so many things in school work which require 
explanation that a teacher gets used to explaining everything. 
But young children rarely, if ever, learn well such things as how 
to hold a pen or to cut or to sew by being told how; they have 
to be shown how. This does not mean that understanding what 
they are to do, or even why that is the best way to do it, is not 
valuable. It is valuable for pupils to learn to follow directions 
about technique such as are given in books; e.g., to comprehend 
why a certain position is taken in planing, or why deep breaths 
are an essential of good form in running or singing. But such 
learning is valuable more for the knowledge it gives than for its 
direct influence in improving form. Imitation of a concrete model 
is necessary to that end, at least with a majority of pupils. 
Demonstration by the teacher is usually the most effective 
method of setting the model, but verbal directions are very 
helpful and, with some pupils, quite necessary. 
Examples.—In demonstrating to a lower-grade class how 
to make a ‘‘eut-out picture’’ the teacher should be careful 
to turn partly away from the class and hold the model as it 
will appear to them as they work. Children have great 
difficulty in imitating a piece of paper cutting, or other like 
  
? Thid. 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
    
LESSONS INVOLVING IMITATION 147 
  work, when the model is held in front of the teacher. Even 
with the older children and adults this is an important 
factor. Many men in the army were cursed for stupidity by 
drill sergeants for throwing the gun across the body from 
left to right instead of vice versa when the fault really lay 
with the sergeant, who was too ignorant to understand his 
own blunder in presentation. 
In setting up a model to be copied, as in drawing, care 
should be taken that the light and angles are favorable to 
the class. Too much or too little light, glares, or shadows all 
alter the model materially. Perspective is also affected 
radically by the location of the model or the seating of the 
pupil. Placing several copies of the model in such cases 
will help. 
The model in lessons involving the memorization of 
poems, either for personal enjoyment or for expressive 
recitation later, is, of course, the book supplemented by the 
teacher in the case of expressive rendition. It must be 
noted in passing that all memorization is to be preceded by 
a thorough analysis of the thought content of the material 
involved. Sometimes this may precede the actual mem- 
orization in a brief discussion. In other cases involving 
lengthy and important selections there may be regular 
problem-solving exercise based upon the content; in still 
others it may be presented as if it were the first two steps in 
arriving at a generalization. In the learning of tables, 
arbitrary associations, paradigms, ete., the model is the 
printed formula, and the teacher’s efforts are not so much 
needed in setting the model as in arousing and sustaining 
interest during imitation and drill. 
An excellent concrete discussion of good and bad ways 
to conduct such lessons as are discussed in this chapter will 
be found in F. M. McMurry, Elementary School Standards, 
pages 27 to 41. 
Imitation—After the teacher has set the model, or indi-

cated the material to be memorized, and has checked to see 
that all have a clear idea of what is to be done, the pupils 
attempt to direct their activity along the lines laid down. 
In motor learning there are two questions for the teacher 
to bear in mind. First, how much trial-and-error learning 
shall be allowed? Second, should the attention be on the 
objective result or upon the movement as it takes place? 
1. Trial and error. As long as a pupil is progressing 
and learning through his mistakes, he should be allowed to 
proceed by trial and error. At the point, however, that the 
law of diminishing returns enters, that is, when mistakes are 
being made and time wasted without commensurate return, 
the teacher must redirect activity. A good deal of trial- 
and-error learning that would be inevitable in real life may 
be eliminated through correct setting of the model. 
Thorndike points out that there must be some oppor- 
tunity to make mistakes in order to teach the avoidance of 
them. Teachers who carefully safeguard their pupils from 
possible errors not only stifle real activity but also prevent 
the pupil from acquiring habits of caution, self-restraint, 
and inhibition of useless movements. 
When activity is redirected by the teacher, it should be 
in such manner as to guide the pupil in finding and criti- 
eizing his own mistakes, rather than to point out the mis- 
takes and demonstrate the correction. Of course as a last 
resort with pupils who are getting hopelessly lost the cor- 
rect method must be given outright. 
It is to be noted that trial-and-error learning will differ 
materially depending on whether it is exercised upon a 
mental association or upon a motor skill. In the case of 
the mental association the model can be exactly perceived 
by the learner and imitated correctly rather early in the 
process. Correct repetition is then necessary to make it 
automatic and there will be little of error. Correction is 
gained by reference to the model. As a matter of fact, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
    LESSONS INVOLVING IMITATION 149 
term ‘‘trial-and-error learning’’ probably should not be 
applied to this type of learning. In the case of motor skill, 
however, the model cannot, technically speaking, be cor- 
rectly perceived, or at first approximated by the learner. 
An extended period of progressive learning, or practice, 
then ensues, involving a good deal of trial and error, in 
which each correct response aids in inhibiting wrong re- 
sponses. 
2. Attention upon the result or upon the movement? 
‘A good summary in answer to this is found in Parker :* 
Ordinarily the learner’s attention should be centered on the 
objective result of the movement, not on the movement itself. 
An elaborate analysis of the movements in terms of the anatomy 
and operation of the parts of the body concerned is generally a 
waste of time and often prevents the attaining of the best results, 
Musical technique and pronunciation furnish good examples. 
Oceasionally explicit attention to the character of the movement 
seems to be helpful. 
The routine factors involved in imitation should be given 
attention. All materials, tools, apparatus, etc., that will be 
used should be on hand and in place. Much time is lost and 
confusion invited by neglecting this phase of preparation 
for work. 
Criticism.—Many points regarding criticism and correc- 
tion have already been made in discussing imitation. Ob- 
viously, both steps occur simultaneously in most cases. 
Sometimes at the end of the lesson there is a definite period 
of comparison and discussion concerning good and bad 
points. Good pieces of work should be commended as well 
as errors corrected. Often a piece of good work by a pupil 
is more efficacious in making clear what is to be done, or in 
correcting errors, than is discussion by the teacher. 
The teacher must work for skill in detecting the real

nature of the difficulty whenever a pupil is in trouble. Then 
effort must be made to so direct the activity that the pupil 
participates in the actual discovery and correction of the 
error. The dominating principle in correction is that the 
teacher’s efforts be directed toward the development of 
intelligent self-criticism by the pupil. 
The criticism of pupils’ errors in learning an association 
or in memorizing consists principally in calling attention to 
the errors and in suggesting better distributions of study 
time and of repetitions and better methods of memorizing. — 
Drill_—After the motor skill can be exercised with a fair 
degree of accuracy, or the series of associations repeated, 
there must be a number of repetitions of the perfect 
process in order to make the activity or association auto- 
matic. This is the bugbear of school and is a learning 
process which has been overworked and misused. probably 
more than any other. Great numbers of students have 
been discouraged and have disliked school because of the 
drudgery of drill. Teachers often abhor it, which does 
not make it easier for the pupils. However, much time 
and effort have been expended by psychologists and peda- 
gogues in an endeavor to make this absolutely necessary 
and vital process more easily administered. Their experi- 
ments and theories have resulted in a body of informa- 
tion, formulated into principles, the understanding and 
application of which are a fundamental part of the teaching 
process. These principles are important enough and their 
discussion lengthy enough to warrant the separate dis- 
cussion that will be found in the next chapter. 
It should be remembered that lessons of the type dis- 
eussed in this chapter are not the only sources of materia] 
that must be drilled upon. The generalizations, rules, 
definitions, ete., gained through lessons for that purpose, 
as well as important facts arrived at during problem- 
solving exercises, must also be made permanent by drill.
-P-A-G-E-171
LESSONS INVOLVING IMITATION 151 
Limitations of This Method—This method of teaching 
is easily perverted into a dogmatic * setting of the model 
by the teacher, followed by slavish imitation on the part 
of the pupil. It can also be applied easily to material that 
should be taught by the more difficult lessons involving 
reflective thought. These perversions, very common in the 
past and still far too prevalent, have been responsible for 
much repression of individuality, much poor thinking, and 
much of the dislike of school by children. They have 
also been responsible for much bad behavior. The reac- 
tion against them threatened for a time to sweep imitation 
and memorization out of the school altogether. Many 
teachers go to the other extreme and believe in having no 
imitation and no drill. They argue that such facts as are 
now drilled upon can be acquired as well by incidental use. 
Experimental data show the futility of such procedure. 
This same group of teachers decry memory and would 
throw overboard all memorization of dates, locations, for- 
mulas, ete. This also is absurd; the point involved is not 
the non-use of memory but the proper use of it. 
Applied to dogmatic, arbitrary facts, formulas and 
skills, with proper care taken to safeguard individual 
variations and to provide for independent reactions, this 
method will be found justifiable and efficacious. 
Summary For THE SUPERVISOR 
Below will be found the usual outline of questions to be 
used by the supervisor in observing and improving lessons 
of this type. 
  
*The lesson based upon imitation, outlined in this chapter, is often 
referred to as the ‘‘ dogmatic lesson.’’ If this term is used, it should 
be carefully explained to young students that ‘‘dogmatic’’ is used 
technically. It does not mean that the lesson is dogmatically and 
arbitrarily administered. If there is danger of too literal interpre- 
tation of the word, it should probably be avoided.

General Questions 
1. Does the subject matter being taught demand this type of 
treatment? 
Setting the Manet | 
. Does the teacher “set the stage’: 
(a) By bringing the class to a realization of their lack of, 
and need for, the association or skill to be taught? 
(b) By arousing the proper mental attitude by appealing, 
if necessary, to their instinctive interests? 
(c) By the statement of a clear-cut, concise aim, indicating 
the line of activity for the coming period? 
. Does she set before the class what is generally accepted as the 
best possible method of procedure? 
. Does she break the model up into parts when necessary? 
. Does she demonstrate clearly and effectively what is to be 
done? Supplement with verbal directions when necessary? 
Take care that all can see plainly? Is the model held so 
pupils will view it as they view their own work? 
. Does she check up before starting the class to work in order 
to see if all know exactly what to do? 
Imitation 
1, Is the teacher quick to note those children for whom the 
common method is evidently not the most efficient? Is she 
skillful in adapting the procedure for them? 
2. Is she skillful in detecting when trial-and-error learning has 
gone far enough? Does she redirect activity rather than 
correct directly? Does she correct directly when necessary? 
3. Does she stress attention to the completed association or skill, 
rather than to the details? Does she stimulate flagging 
interest efficiently? 
4, Are all materials, tools, apparatus, etc., in place and ready 
for use? Are ihey distributed, collected, cared for, quietly 
and efficiently?

Criticism 
Imitation and criticism go largely hand in hand. Group 
exhibitions and criticisms should supplement individual 
criticisms from time to time. 
1. Is the teacher skillful in seeing the real difficulty when a 
pupil is held up or stopped? Does she inquire into his 
ideas and processes? 
2. Are her efforts, toward the development of intelligent self- 
analysis and self-criticism by the pupil?

OBSERVATION OUTLINE IN TERMS or Popm AcTIvITY 
No distinction is made between the questions that bear 
upon the learning of a motor skill and those bearing upon 
the acquisition of an arbitrary association of facts. The 
applications are obvious. Furthermore, no real distinction 
can be made between questions bearing upon imitation 
and criticism. The two processes, as has been said, go hand 
in hand and the formal division is made merely to facilitate 
discussion. In actual practice the process will be observed 
as a whole. 
Setting the Model 
1. Do the pupils ask questions that show their realization of 
the lack of and need for certain associations or skills? Do 
they suggest learning them in order to be able to proceed? 
2. Do they ask to be shown how to use certain tools? To make 
drawings? To play desired games? To make necessary 
measurements and computations? 
3. Do they suggest ways and means of learning and practicing 
the new associations and skills? 
4. Do they break the model up if too much is given them? 
Adapt it freely to their individual capacities? 
5. Do they ask further explanations if they do not understand? 
Call for demonstrations? Avoid, however, too many de- 
tailed questions?

6. Can they restate the aim in clear-cut fashion, or tell what is 
_ to be done? 
T. Do they arrange materials and tools in a businesslike manner 
and get ready to start work? Avoid, however, undue 
precipitancy in proceeding before the model is clearly 
understood? 
| Imitation 
1. Do the pupils actively attack the assocjation or skill to be 
learned? Avoid undue dependence on direction from the 
teacher? 
2. Do they try out methods of procedure confidently? Go at 
it again after making an error? Try to find new ways to 
proceed? Avoid giving up after a blunder? 
3. When they make errors or have difficulty are they able to 
detect the error? If so: 
(a) Do they rectify the mistake, learning by means of it? 
(6) Do they, if necessary, seek aid from classmates or 
teacher? 
(ce) Do they avoid trying to cover up, or slip by with poor 
or incorrect work? 
4. Do they practice by themselves such things as number com- 
binations, multiplication tables, spelling words, drawing, 
writing, ete.? Ask permission to practice together in small 
groups? 
5. While seeking aid from the teacher when necessary, do they 
avoid asking too many questions? 
6. Are they handicapped by poor methods of procedure pre- 
“, » viously learned? Do they attempt to work over into the 
new ones? Do any refuse to give up the old procedure? 
7. If they become confused, mixed up, lost, or rattled, do they 
stop and organize for a fresh start? Look for a cue from 
the teacher or in the work of classmates? Avoid sulking, 
giving up, or crying? 
8. Are some uninterested and doing poor work? Are any afraid 
to ask for more directions or help? 
Criticism 
1. Do the pupils tend to stop work occasionally and inspect 
_ what they have done? Hold it off to get better view? 
Repeat what they have memorized?

2. Do they help each other voluntarily? Ask for criticism of 
their own work to be made by classmates or teacher? Do 
they analyze \helpfully the mistakes in a piece of work held 
up by the teacher for criticism? 
3. Do they avoid careless, laughing, or sneering criticisms of 
each other’s work? Avoid laughing at, or making fun of, 
those who are not expert? 
4. Do they avoid unfair praise of a friend’s work, or unfair 
condemnation of an unpopular pupil’s work? 
5. Do they profit by their own and each other’s mistakes? 
6. Do pupils comment on the degree to which their work approx- 
imates the teacher’s model? Approximates the best work 
done by a pupil? 
7. Do they use standard scores in the formal skills as a goal? 
Work toward them? Do they use writing scales, drawing 
scales, etc., as measures of the excellence of their work? 
8. Do they try for further improvement after the standard score 
or scale value has been reached?

  CHAPTER VII 
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE DRILL PROCESS 
The types of lessons discussed in the preceding chapter 
are practically always followed by periods of drill in which 
the associations or skills are repeated over and over again 
until they are permanent and automatic. Other types of 
lessons are also productive of some material that must be 
drilled upon. As has been stated, the drill process by its 
very nature is prone to become monotonous, dull, and dis- 
tasteful. Some teachers even believe that it is not good 
drill unless it is ‘‘hard’’ for the pupil. Since the principal 
purpose is repetition which must be done, they say the pupil 
would better learn to do this distasteful thing with the best 
possible grace. Some of them argue further that the learning 
is better and that there are benefits to the moral fiber accruing 
from forcing one’s self through the dull, uninteresting task. 
The latter point is now an exploded theory, and in regard to 
the first points there is now much experimental evidence 
with which to contradict them. 
Some of these experimental results have been combined 
with James’ famous laws of habit formation by different 
authors who have formulated principles for the conduct of 
drill lessons. The majority of authors have held rather 
closely to James’ laws, which are the classic pronouncement 
in the field. Excellent as they are, they have needed elab- 
oration and addition for some time. Such a treatment, 
making these laws more specific and exact, adding much 
from recent experiments, will be found in Parker, General 
Methods of Teaching in Elementary Schools, Chapter X, or 
156
-P-A-G-E-177
    PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE DRILL PROCESS 157 
in Chapter VIII of the same author’s text on high-school 
method. The first reference seems to be the most practical 
and explicit discussion available for the elementary teacher. 
The present discussion of the supervision of drill is based 
largely upon it, and, through the kind permission of Pro- 
fessor Parker, much of it is quoted directly. 
Obviously the drill lessons will not have sequential steps 
as have the lessons discussed previously. They are con- 
cerned with but one thing, the repetition of the same 
material over and over again. The teacher’s task is to 
secure as many correct repetitions as possible, accompanied 
by the highest degree of attention and interest that can be 
maintained. To enable her to do this the following prin- 
ciples, based upon Parker, are laid down: 
1. A correct start followed by correct practice must be 
insured. Speed should be subordinated to accuracy. 
2. Zeal, interest, and concentration of attention must be 
secured and maintained. 
8. Feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction must be 
considered as they vitally condition the results of a drill 
lesson. ¢ : 
4. Avoid waste of time on accessory and non-essential 
processes. Drill must be on the association or skill in- 
volved, 
5. The facts drilled on in games and devices must be 
applied in real situations. 
6. The drill periods should be short and distributed over 
a considerable length of time. 
7. In memorization there should be an analysis of the 
thought content first. Correct recall should be the prin- 
cipal method used; the ‘‘whole’’ instead of the ‘‘part’’ 
method. 
‘What are the procedures on the part of the teacher for 
which the supervisor should watch that will indicate to 
him her mastery of, or ignorance of, these principles?  
-P-A-G-E-178
  158 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
How shall the supervisor bring about a better understand- 
ing and use of them? 
A Correct Start Followed by Correct Practice; Speed 
Subordinated to Accuracy.—The old rule ‘‘practice makes 
perfect’’ needs some analysis and change before accept- 
ance; practice can as easily make one imperfect if the 
wrong thing is practiced. Every precaution must be taken 
to see that all have exactly in mind what is to be done. 
One or two of the brighter pupils may be called on to state 
for the class what is going to be done and others from the 
slower group asked to repeat. Devices such as having the 
girls tell what is to be done, or the boys, or the different 
rows, all have for their purpose making clear the pro- 
cedure to be followed. Finally a few check questions 
should be asked to see that a correct start will be made by 
all. 
The danger of incorrect practice is well illustrated by 
the case of the teacher whose class could patter. off the 
little rhymes in the primer and first reader but had 
no real understanding of the words. A supervisor cut the 
pages in one reader so that the picture of Little Red 
Riding-hood came above the words relating to Little Boy 
Blue and vice versa. One of the glib readers was then given 
the book—and she repeated word for word the selection 
about Little Boy Blue, though she was, as a matter of fact, 
looking at the words concerning Little Red Riding-hood. 
This teacher’s work was poor in word drill, and the children 
had quickly memorized tlie oral model and were not reading 
off the page at all, though experts at pretending. Such an 
example is extreme, of course, but there is great danger in 
lower grades that through incorrect practice children will 
learn to patter off a series of words or string of numbers 
and not really be gaining the knowledge or power desired. 
With motor skills there will often be an astonishing lack 
of comprehension of what is to be done even when the
-P-A-G-E-179
  PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE DRILL PROCESS 159 
movement is demenstrated and worked out in detail. After 
a teacher has stood directly in front of a class and made 
lines with a crayola across the page, calling their attention 
to the direction and motion, some are sure to draw lines up 
and down or round and round. Much material will be 
wasted in drawing, sewing, and manual training, or injury 
will result in gymnastics or athletics, if the pupil does not 
see clearly what to do before he starts. This matter is 
emphasized, of course, during the original learning (set- 
ting the model) but must be reémphasized at the begin- 
ning of drill periods. 
This matter of making clear what is to be done and 
getting a correct start is related to the second part of the 
principle, the subordination of speed to accuracy. It is 
(2 great temptation usually to start work before making 
sure that every single pupil is ready, but impatience must 
be restrained. There is danger also in adapting the pace 
to the very quick members of the class, thus dragging the 
slow pupils over the ground at a pace incompatible with 
accuracy. The discussion of individual differences applies 
here and should be re-read. 
Speed must be emphasized but not until sufficient ac- 
curagy has been attained to give the pupil confidence. 
Courtis says on this subject :* 
The surest sign of faulty use of the practice tests is the speed 
which is due to excessive effort and nervous strain. The speed 
that is desired is the perfection of execution produced by thor- . 
oughness of preparation. The speed: that is merely hurry makes 
for exhaustion. Do not force speed. Inspire conscientious prac- 
tice and the question of speed will take care of itself. 
In regard to writing, Freeman says: ?

1919, p. 4. 2 National Society for the Study of Education, Highteenth Yearbook, 
1919, p. 15.
-P-A-G-E-180
  160 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
The speed of writing should be low at the beginning and should 
gradually increase . . . Pupils should maintain a balance between 
attainment in form and speed, so as not to develop one quality 
to an extreme degree at the expense of the other. 
Gray points out in regard to reading that: * 
The rapid readers usually read more effectively than slow 
readers ... but for a given pupil the comprehension of what 
is read decreases as the rate of reading increases above his 
normal rate. : 
Evidence on this point is not unanimous, however, since 
Monroe states in regard to arithmetic: * 
In the operations in arithmetic emphasis should be placed upon 
rapid work rather than upon accuracy ... Of course accuracy 
should not be neglected. Tell pupils to be accurate but do not 
suggest that increased accuracy is to be secured by working more 
slowly. The greater emphasis should be placed upon the rate of 
work. There are doubtless exceptions and there is a limit beyond 
which this relation does not hold. 
A good summary of this first principle of drill which 
points many practical applications is found in Earhart: * 
It is most desirable that teachers who consciously train pupils 
in habit-formation should take pains to see that the first associa- 
tions are correct, and that the first acts are those which are to be 
fixed by drill. The position for writing, the manner of holding 
the pen, the forms of the letters, the forms of figures, the order 
of letters in words, the utterance of sounds in phonie drill, the 
tones used in singing and reading, reading connectedly instead of 
in a choppy, word-at-a-time fashion, the pronunciation of new 
words, the number combinations, and the many other details which 
should become automatic, are all matters which should be 
started in the right way. To say, “Never mind for the present. 
That matter will take care of itself by and by”; or, “When the 
pupils are old enough to know better, they will do differently” is

-P-A-G-E-181
  PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE DRILL PROCESS 161 
to disregard the force of habits when once they are formed, and the 
probability of their continuing as they are begun. It is safer far 
to begin with the correct habit and thus make sure of it... 
When the correct habits have once been started, it is often neces- 
sary to consider how they may be made to operate quickly. 
Zeal, Interest, and Concentration of Attention Must Be 
Secured and Maintained.—The old story about the boy 
who was kept after school to write upon the board ‘‘I 
have gone’’ 150 times and who concluded with a note to 
his teacher, ‘‘I have went home,”’ illustrates the result of 
drill without interest and attention. Despite the opinions 
of a few teachers who believe that interest cannot be 
aroused for drill lessons, it can and should be secured. 
Ordinarily it is better to drill a few times with a high 
degree of interest than to drill a great number of times 
with little or no interest. The same problem is presented 
here that has been discussed before; there must be an 
appeal to instinctive interests or a realization of the 
intrinsic worth of the subject matter. An aim may or may 
not be stated, but when a snappy, interesting aim can be 
devised, it aids greatly in focusing attention and arousing 
curiosity. 
An unlimited number of games and devices that have 
for their purpose the arousing and maintaining of interest 
during drill periods, have been worked out by teachers 
through the years. Primary number work and reading 
afford almost continuous opportunity for the use of such 
games, with which teachers should familiarize themselves. 
They may be found in such texts as Parker, in magazines 
dealing with method, or they may be obtained from other 
teachers. The supervisor should see to it that the young 
teachers acquire a store of them in different subjects. 
Those he finds in use by older teachers, especially if de- 
vised by them, should be complimented and passed on to 
others. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  162 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
As an example might be cited the simple game of naming 
the leaves on a tree drawn on the blackboard. Attention 
ean be held several minutes on pronouncing the words 
written on the leaves, each correct one counting a score 
for the pupil. Sometimes real leaves can be given with 
which to keep score. Having one child think of a word 
and the others guess it by pronouncing is another device 
in word drill. Any number of counting games and types 
of spelling matches can be devised. Flash cards not only 
hold attention but are very economical of time. These 
few examples are cited merely as illustrations; a whole 
volume would be necessary to recount all that are in 
use. 
The game or device should be changed as often as cir- 
cumstances seem to demand, as for instance when interest 
flags or begins to be focused elsewhere. When the period 
is so short as to admit of but one game per period, new 
ones should be used each time for several days. Some- 
times the children will manifest a liking for some of the 
games and a helpful device is to allow them to choose the 
one to use. The teacher must be careful not to confuse 
these devices with method or to allow them to become 
more important than the process being drilled. 
Feelings of Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction Must 
Be Considered.—Responses accompanied by satisfaction 
tend to be repeated and stamped in, while responses 
accompanied by dissatisfaction tend to be avoided and 
lost. This may seem to some teachers and supervisors to 
be a part of the preceding principle. The matter of in- 
terest and the matter of satisfaction are closely related, 
of course, likewise flagging attention and dissatisfaction. 
If this were all, the two points would be the same and no 
separate principle would be necessary. However, children 
ean be intensely interested and still be: dissatisfied. On 
the other hand, one of the teacher’s bugbears is the child
-P-A-G-E-183
  PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE DRILL PROCESS 163 
who is quite satisfied and happy but who is neither paying 
attention nor doing any learning. 
The first group of children, those who are interested 
and trying their best but who are dissatisfied and un- 
happy, suffer a real handicap in their learning. Slow 
children can often suffer a great deal of humiliation with 
disastrous results to their work when brought into com- 
petition with brighter ones. Administrative or teaching 
devices to bring children of corresponding intelligence 
level or special-ability level into competition with each 
other should be worked out and applied. The skillful dis- 
tribution of assignments so that each may accomplish 
something and feel the satisfaction of achievement will 
help. Another good device is to train the individuals to 
compete with their own records. 
In the case of the pupil who is satisfied and happy but 
doing nothing there should be an examination to see if 
he is mentally normal. In most cases he will be and the 
case is really a disciplinary one. Either at home or in 
previous grades he has been allowed to loiter, to evade, 
and to shirk. Every effort should be made to enlist his: 
attention and effort and to cure his attitude of com- 
placence. Failing legitimate attempts, he must be dealt 
with in such manner as to force him to participate and do 
his share. Such a case is complicated, of course, by the 
workings of the very principles here discussed. His forced 
work will be attended by feelings of dislike and dissatis- 
faction which will make his codperation poor and his work 
slow. However, persistence will probably arouse a latent 
pride, an interest in competition, or a real liking for doing 
well. 
Avoid Waste of Time on Accessory and Non-Essential 
Processes.—Probably everyone remembers from grade- 
school days the laborious copying of problems from the 
board preparatory to working them. In manual training, 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  
164 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
drawing, nature study, ete., it often took more of the period 
to get the materials and put the tools in shape than was left 
for the actual work. In language long paragraphs and 
sentences were copied for purposes of correction. Prob- 
ably there are grown men whose fingers will ache as they 
recall the endless copying of missed words in spelling, or 
the rewriting of compositions because the margin was a 
sixteenth of an inch too wide or because the commas got 
mixed up with the semicolons, All of this was looked on 
as a necessary part of the school procedure until recently 
but is, as a matter of fact, an atrocious waste of time. 
Another example of wasted time is found in drilling on 
an error that is not present or upon a skill that is fairly 
well perfected by all of the class. Many young normal 
graduates have excellent plans for the elimination of com- 
mon errors in language or for teaching some motor skill, 
and they apply these plans to classes that have never 
heard of the error or who will have no possible use for 
the skill involved. 
In many drill games there must be considerable passing 
back and forth by the children. This should be routinized 
and speeded up so that undue time is not given to it. 
One of the most intelligent devices in this matter of 
concentrating drill upon the real processes is the use of 
flash cards. Practically every teacher has made a few or 
purchased some for one subject or another. The limits 
of the teacher’s ingenuity and originality are the limits 
of what can be done in this field. In one or two subjects 
there are excellent ready-made systems of drill cards on 
the market which have been worked out by experts and 
are based upon a long period of experimentation. Super- 
visors should know where these can be purchased and 
which ones to recommend. A good summary of sources 
of this material will be found in Parker, General Methods 
of Teaching in Elementary Schools, page 267.

The Facts Drilled Upon in Games and Devices Must Be

often frightened by real situations that call for skills and 
associations that have been drilled on in class in isolation. 
Children can be drilled until they are letter perfect in 
such things and still be unable to use them coherently. 
They are sometimes unable to recognize situations that 
involve them. This point is illustrated by the child who 
came home and told his parents, ‘‘We had the ‘guzintas’ 
at school to-day.’? Asked to explain, he replied: ‘‘Why 
don’t you know? Two ‘guzinta’ four two times, three 
‘guzinta’ nine three times, and like that. It’s lots of fun 
having the ‘guzintas.’’’ There was no thought that the 
‘‘guzintas’’? were for any other use. Some children can 
spell words well in columns but miss them when writing 
sentences; others recognize words in word drill very well 
but do not read them well in the book. In arithmetic the 
point is doubly important because of the many formal 
skills and combinations involved. Much of the shift in 
emphasis from formal grammar toward language work is 
a result of recognizing the difficulty here discussed. 
The supervisor should assist teachers in providing 
clothed problems and supplementary exercises that in- 
volve the application of skills and associations learned 
elsewhere. Many opportunities for such applications can 
be found in regular problem-solving lessons or in the mak- 
ing of generalizations. Drill itself can sometimes be carried 
on by means of clothed problems, provided they are short 
enough to allow for repetition, which is essential in drill. 
In an effort to make school processes identical with real 
life there is often a foolish attempt to have used in school 
none but real problems from the community about the 
pupil. Far-fetched applications are made to the measure- 
ment of bins in the new barn, to fields that are to be 
fenced or seeded. The gable angles of new houses and the
-P-A-G-E-186
166 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  shingling of the kitchen roof are also made to supply 
“‘real’’? problems in mensuration. Wherever such prob- 
lems in which the answer is really serviceable to someone 
ean be brought in, it is unquestionably a good device. 
Failing a great supply of them, and that will be the case 
im most instances, the teacher can and must provide drill 
problems of her own or take them from other books. The 
proper use and construction of such auxiliary problems 
will guarantee a reasonable degree of transfer to the prob- 
lems that will be met in real life. Problems that call for 
computations and results that are in no way useful or con- 
nected with possible situations should be ruled out. 
Drill Periods Should Be Short and Distributed Over a 
Considerable Length of Time.—Twenty-five years ago drill 
periods in practically all subjects were of long duration. 
This is the case even yet in some schools. If a pupil did 
not do well, the period was lengthened. This latter device 
seemed to be practically the only reaction teachers made 
to poor drill work. The beginnings of change appeared 
when Superintendent Rice created a furore by presenting 
figures showing that children drilled ten minutes a day 
did as well in spelling as children drilled forty minutes a 
day. His findings were greeted with ridicule and abuse, 
but there has been a steady shift of opinion until now 
there is a vast mass of experimental data supporting the 
theory of short, intensive drill periods. It should be noted 
in passing that while the majority of experiments favor 
this theory there are some important studies that seem to 
contradict it. Individual differences also enter in and 
condition the workings of the idea: ° 
For any one habit in any one person there is some one best 
distribution of time over the series. For one habit or set of habits 
it may be best to give ten drills of twenty minutes for the first 
  *Tbid., p. 169.
-P-A-G-E-187
  PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE DRILL PROCESS 167 
week, ten drills of ten minutes the second week, ten drills of five 
minutes the third week, five drills of eight minutes the fourth 
week, and one drill of ten minutes a month for four months. Or 
it may be best to distribute the 460 minutes in a very different 
way. 
In the lower grades experiments tend to show that from 
five to ten minutes is the best period and this can be 
gradually increased in the upper grades. In the lower 
grades, again, the periods will probably be more frequent, 
in some cases two or three a day. The higher the interest, 
the longer the period can run. This, in fact, should be the 
teacher’s guide in large measure; when interest flags, 
there should be a change of game or device. After one or 
two such changes attention will flag somewhat despite the 
new game and a halt should be called. The danger of 
catering to whim and indifference instead of a genuine 
flagging of interest must be guarded against. 
As more and more power is gained the interval between 
drills can be lengthened. Drill should not end abruptly 
but taper off with tests at intervals to determine the 
amount of retention. These tests may take the form of 
clothed problems or of standardized formulas for the 
purpose. Practically all the systems of ready-made drill 
material, discussed above, have with them standard scores 
for age and grade, together with standardized tests for 
determining where the pupil stands in relation to these 
norms. The theory is that when the pupil reaches a cer- 
tain norm, drill is for him no longer necessary. As fast 
as pupils reach this score they should be excused from 
drill and given other tasks. These may be drill in other 
subjects in which they are not up to par or outside reading 
in a content subject or manual work. Much time is 
wasted and bad behavior invited by retaining a pupil in 
a drill class after he has attained proficiency. However, 
these excused pupils should be called back at regular 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  168 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
intervals and given tests to determine whether the skill or 
association is being retained properly. 
In Memorization There Should Be an Analysis of the 
Thought Content First.—The whole matter of drill is, of 
course, memorization of one kind or another. In cases where 
the associations are dogmatic and arbitrary they must be 
acquired by repetition and the power of rote memory 
aided by the application of all the foregoing discussion. 
The invention of mnemonic systems to aid this process is 
often helpful, though there are certain dangers accom- 
panying such procedure. Much of the material, however, 
will be of such nature that there will be some kind of 
logical association, connection, or sequence. Poetry or 
prose selections illustrate this type of material. In such 
cases the drill period should unfailingly be preceded by a 
thorough discussion of the thought content. This is often 
a separate lesson under a separate aim, involving either 
reflective thought or enjoyment. In addition to supplying 
information or enjoyment, such lessons are definite aids to 
memory. 
The Method of Correct Recall Should Be Used.—The 
method of correct recall is involved when the pupil 
reads or studies the material and then attempts to recall 
it without assistance from the book or model. Many chil- 
dren and adults constantly deceive themselves by keeping 
their eyes on the printed page as they repeat the selection. 
Failing to distinguish between perception and memory, 
they are discouraged by the apparent lack of power when 
independent repetition is attempted. This method of read- 
ing and looking away to recall will be difficult at first 
and may seem to be wasteful and disconnected, but in the 
endetime will be saved. 
The ‘‘Whole’’ Instead of the ‘‘Part’’ Method.— 
‘Another memorization process that seems wrong to the 
beginner is to learn by ‘‘wholes’’ instead of by ‘‘parts,’’
-P-A-G-E-189
  PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE DRILL PROCESS 169 
that is, to learn the selection by reading or studying the 
whole thing and then attempting to recall as much as pos- 
sible. It is astonishing how long a selection can be mas- 
tered more quickly by this method than learning it line by 
lime, paragraph by paragraph, or verse by verse. Attention 
is better and wrong associations are not formed. In learn- 
ing by parts there is danger that the last line of a para- 
graph or verse will become firmly associated with the first 
word of the same paragraph or verse, whereas it should 
be connected with the first word of the division that fol- 
lows. When the selection is unusually long, there must be 
division into parts, but the same theory holds good, for 
these parts are in themselves complete wholes or thought 
units. Divisions should not be made arbitrarily by verse 
or pages; some may be two pages long, while others are 
only a half-page. The experimental evidence shows that 
as many as six pages of poetry can be learned faster by 
working on the whole six pages than by dividing it up into 
pieces. With children the amount will be less but the 
principle remains the same. 
SUMMARY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
A slight formal variation will be found in this outline, 
in that the principles are numbered instead of the ques- 
tions, making for ease of reference. This outline is to be 
used as the preceding ones, either as a basis for discussion 
or report, or to be checked and left with the teacher. 
OBSERVATION OUTLINE FoR Dritt Lessons 
General Questions 
(a) Are the associations or skills being drilled upon valuable 
enough to justify making them automatic? 
(b) Is the sum total of the teacher’s effort toward the intelli- 
gent selection of associations and skills and the in- 
dependent automatizing of them by the pupil in the 
future? 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  170 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Application of Drill Principles 
1. A correct start followed by correct practice must be insured. 
Speed must wait upon accuracy. 
(a) Does the teacher check to see that all have the correct 
response or reaction before starting drill? 
(b) Is she painstaking and patient in securing accuracy 
from all, rather than a high speed from a few? 
2. Zeal, interest, and concentration of attention must be secured 
and maintained. 
(a) Is there an aim stated, as in the teaching lessons? (This 
is often not present, but where possible an aim should 
be set up based upon the intrinsic worth of the ma- 
terial or upon such instinctive interest as fits the case.) 
(b) Is interest initiated and maintained, either by this aim, 
or by other legitimate means? 
(c) Is the teacher quick to note flagging of attention? Does 
she change games and devices? Avoid deadening 
repetition? 
(d) Does she show wide knowledge of, and skill in the use 
of, simple devices such as games and plays; of more 
pretentious devices such as group contests, exhibitions, 
independent work, ete. 
3. Feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction must be consid- 
ered, as they vitally condition the results of a drill lesson. 
(a) Is there regard for the principle of individual differences 
so that the slow ones are not dissatisfied because of 
comparison with the faster ones? Are pupils grouped 
where possible? Do they compete with their own 
records? 
(b) Are handicap games and contests used to give everyone 
a chance to show progress and success? 
(c) Does the teacher use or call for the use of diagnostic 
tests in order to determine the nature and amount of 
drill necessary? 
4, Avoid waste of time on accessory and non-essential processes. 
(a) Does the teacher make use of ready-made, scientifically 
constructed drill systems, sheets of problems, flash 
eards, games, completion tests, ete.? Failing these, 
does she construct her own, modeled after the ready- 
made systems? 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE DRILL PROCESS 171 
(b) Does she avoid writing long lists of problems, words, 
paragraphs, etc., on the board? Avoid having the 
pupils copy such things preliminary to the real drill? 
(c) Does she have a well organized routine for the handling 
of such material as is indispensable? For calling on 
the pupils or the group? For moving them to the 
board, about the room in games, etc.? 
(d@) In those drills involving books, references, vocabularies, 
notes, etc., are they at hand and is their use well 
routinized? 
(e) Does she avoid drilling upon processes already fixed? 
Avoid drilling on errors that are not present, ‘or 
upon skills that will be of little use to the group in 
question? 
5. The facts drilled upon in games and devices must be applied 
to and used in real situations. 
(a) Does the teacher make sufficient and intelligent use of 
clothed problems, new completion tests, other books, 
real-life situations, etc., in which the new associations 
and skills are put to use in an appropriate setting? 
6. The drill periods should be short and distributed over a con- 
siderable length of time. 
(a) Do the drill periods approximate the length of time 
that has been found experimentally to be the best for 
the particular subject? (Usually about ten minutes.) 
(b) Is the distribution of these periods through the day, 
week, or other interval in accord with the needs of the 
situation? 
(c) Does the teacher make use of the standard score that 
accompanies most of the ready-made drill systems 
to determine the amount of drill necessary? To 
determine individual differences? To stimulate work? 
As a basis of comparison? 
(d) Does the teacher end drill abruptly or taper off? Does 
she check from time to time after stopping in order 
to determine the retention by different individuals in 
the group? 
7. In memorizing meaningful material there should be an 
analysis of the thought content first. The method of correct recall 
should be used; the “whole” instead of the “part” method. 
(a) Is the analysis of thought skillfully introduced? Sep- 
arately or as part of the lesson? 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  172 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
(b) Does the teacher explain to pupils the method of correct 
recall and stimulate them to use it? 
(c) Does she stimulate learning by the “whole” method? 
Break up too long selections into thought units?

THE ASSIGNMENT OF LESSONS 
  A fourth-grade youngster once said to his parents: ‘‘I 
like school this year, Miss A—— gives us so many things 
to do. Last year Miss M. just said, ‘Open your books 
and go to work.’’’ The two teachers mentioned repre- 
sent two of the many classes into which teachers fall in 
regard to assigning lessons. The common idea of the 
assignment, to which practice still conforms in too many 
instances, is that it is that part of the teaching exercise 
where just as the bell rings the teacher says hurriedly, 
“Work the list of problems on page 76,’’ or, ‘‘Take the 
next six pages for to-morrow.’’ Even when practice is — 
better than that, as it is in many cases, the idea still pre- 
vails that an assignment has to do with the textbook. A 
better idea is set forth in Earhart :+   
\ 
(The assignment) may be the acquiring of knowledge from 
some source, whether from books, people, observation, or reflec- 
tion. It may be the collection of materials for an object lesson. 
It may be the application of principles as in geometry, arithmetic, 
or grammar. It may be a private drill exercise in spelling, 
multiplication tables, penmanship, oral reading, music, or sewing, 
or some other subject which requires practice to insure skill. It 
may be the performing of certain exercises to correct physical 
defects or to assist physical development, as bending, stretching, 
and drawing deep breaths. Any teaching which involves work 
outside of the class period must evidently require an assignment; 
hence to limit the discussion to textbook lessons is to treat the 
subject too narrowly. The assignment may be a part of an

  THE ASSIGNMENT OF LESSONS 
inductive or deductive exercise, an object lesson, a drill lesson, a 
review lesson, or any form of class exercise which conforms to the 
conditions above stated. 
The Assignment in Lessons Involving Reflective 
Thought.—In discussing the preparation and problem 
steps in the two exercises involving reflective thought it 
was pointed out that these steps may be of either of two 
natures. In one case they may be the first phase of a 
conversational or developmental recitation, in which event 
they are not commonly thought of as assignments. But 
equally often these steps prepare the class for independent 
work outside and are in reality assignments. 
, It will be recalled that the work of these steps is to 
i (recall th the necessary old knowledge, arouse interest, and 
et an al aim | indicating what is to be done. ‘Sometimes all 
tliree purposes can be served by encouraging an argument 
that will lead to the statement of an aim, the solution of 
which promises to settle the argument. After the prin- 
cipal problem has been stated, considerable discussion 
might ensue regarding the data that would have to be 
gathered and their sources. A half-dozen minor assignments 
in the nature of individual or group problems might have 
to be made, leading to a contribution or socialized recita- 
tion later. In such cases there is much valuable pupil 
participation not only in finding the aim or problem but 
also in suggesting ways and means to solve it. 
Examples——During the war an upper-grade class study- 
ing the geography of their own state, Oregon, were led into 
a discussion of Hoover’s call to save food. Meat substitutes 
were discussed and fish mentioned. The question was asked 
whether Oregon, by substituting, could contribute anything 
to the food-saving movement. The salmon fisheries of the 
Columbia River were mentioned, but discussion revealed 
the fact that no one knew exactly how the fish were caught
-P-A-G-E-198
  178 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
and canned. The matters of hatcheries, of fights between 
officers and illegal netters, ete., were mentioned by different 
pupils. The aim was quickly set up, ‘‘Let us see how the 
salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are carried on.’’ 
The class then, worked out a list of things they would have 
to find out about. Individual and group assignments in- 
cluded the following: ‘‘How the fish are caught,’’ ‘‘How 
they are prepared for the cannery,’’ ‘‘How they are put in 
the cans,’’ ‘‘How the hatchery at Bonneville is operated.”’ 
These are but a few samples of the topics studied. The class 
gathered pictures, bulletins, magazines, in all a remarkable 
amount of information. One boy discovered that a student 
in the high school had lived on the Columbia and suggested 
that he be asked to visit the class and tell what he had 
seen. Another boy found in the library Jordan’s Life of a 
Salmon and the teacher herself gained some valuable infor- 
mation from it. 
A similar lesson during the war, which resulted in 
several assignments that necessitated the gathering of 
data from all sources and involved considerable corre- 
spondence, had for its aim, ‘‘How the American Red Cross 
is carrying on its work.”’ 
~The local history of a region is a good opportunity for 
a real assignment lesson. Making a poster or set of posters 
to illustrate the products of a group of states or to illus- 
trate the phases of an industry will also involve the 
assignment of a number of sources and provide for indi- 
vidual and varied work. The class can often participate 
in outlining sources and the teacher should refer them to 
  others she has prepared in advance. In many of the | 
assignments of the type here discussed there will be a 
definite outline of topics and sub-topics. Again an oppor- 
tunity for pupil participation is afforded, though in some 
eases mimeographed outlines should be passed out after 
the class have opened the topic as far as they can.
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE ASSIGNMENT OF LESSONS 179 
“ The assignment will also prepare for difficulties the 
pupils may meet in their independent work. Hard words, 
idiomatic phrases, and other linguistic difficulties should 
be explained. Lists of study questions may be prepared 
and passed out in mimeographed form which will materially 
aid the pupil in searching for information and organizing 
it for presentation in class. Other aids to study can be 
given, of course, and they will be treated in Chapter IX. | 
Each assignment cannot stop, of course, to clear up all 
difficulties; it cannot even indicate all possible sources of 
information in some cases. But the pupil should master 
by means of a series of properly made assignments the use 
of dictionaries, cyclopedias, supplementary books, tables 
of contents, indexes, marginal headings, graphs, charts, 
pictures, ete. Intelligent use of such mechanical details 
will clear up many study difficulties. The pupil should 
also acquire the ability to outline properly and to discrim- 
inate between facts in the making of the outline; to know 
when to read all of an article or chapter and when to read 
rapidly, skipping detail. He should learn to find other 
sources than those given him and to make intelligent com- 
parisons. These things are all elements in the study 
process and will be discussed in detail by themselves, but 
it is to be emphasized here that proper assignments must 
take them into account. Closely related to outlining 
is the matter of taking notes, few of which should be 
ealled for. It is usually better to advise pupils to under- 
line their own textbooks rather than to make notes from 
them. 
The Assignment in Lessons Involving the Acquisition 
of Associations and Skills—In this type of lesson there 
is rarely an elaborate assignment. It usually consists of 
setting the model clearly before the class and setting them 
to work upon it. There should be attention also to the 
supply of materials and tools.

180 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
    y Where Should the Assignment Be Placed in the Lesson 
Period?—As the preceding discussion makes clear, the 
assignment more often comes at the first of the period than 
at the last. However, after a topic has been outlined and 
is in full swing, the work may progress at varying speeds 
for the different parts, making it necessary for the teacher 
to take the last few minutes to sum up what has been 
done and to refocus attention on what is to be done during 
the next study period. /When the work progresses evenly 
or when the next day’s work does not depend in any way 
upon the present discussion, the assignment should come 
at the first. In the case of drill problems in arithmetic, 
spelling, ete., the assignment should also come first. In 
either case, however, sufficient time must be allowed. 
Assignments may take ten minutes or they may take two 
thirty-minute periods, depending on the subject, grade, 
and type of pupils. Especially, when the assignment does 
come at the end of the period, the teacher must avoid being 
caught with too little time at her disposal. Such an out- 
come necessitates a hurried, unorganized assignment which 
is detrimental to work and unfair to the pupils. 
The most skillful assignments are those made in answer 
to a question that arises during a lesson. The teacher 
should try to manipulate the situation so that such ques- 
tions will arise, a procedure that can be used very suc- 
cessfully in the content subjects such as history and 
geography. This point is well summarized in Harhart:? 
It frequently happens that the questions which constitute the 
problems to be solved in the new lesson are raised during the 
course of some lesson a day or more in advance of the period 
when the subject is to be discussed in class. When not too remote 
from the day of recitation, it is worth while to make the assign- 
ment when the questions are raised, even if it interrupt the les- 
son for a few minutes. The motive is in the proper setting then, 
2 Ibid., p. 82.  
-P-A-G-E-201
  THE ASSIGNMENT OF LESSONS 181 
and the new lesson will be all the better prepared on that account. 
If the assignment keeps thus cropping out during the course of 
an exercise or several exercises, there should be a definite re- 
statement of it as a whole before the study period, so that all 
pupils may know just what they are to do and how they are to 
do it. 
‘As Miss Earhart indicates, the principal problem is 
stated as it arises, while the details, sources, individual 
assignments, etc., are worked out later when the topic is 
taken up in earnest. 
All points considered, a definite and rigid rule cannot 
be laid down for the placing of the assignment. The pre- 
eeding discussion will cover many cases, but where con- 
ditions are shifting rapidly, necessitating daily adjustment 
to the progress of the class, the teacher should bear in 
mind that a careful assignment must be made and she 
should not allow the closing bell to call her attention to 
the fact that she has not made it. 
Adapting to Individual Differences.— Reference has 
been made several times to group and individual assign- 
ments. In many eases, of course, there is but the one 
assignment for the whole class, but wherever possible 
there should be/varied assignments adapted to different 
groups within the class. Attention has already been called 
to the device of a minimum-essentials requirement for all, 
supplemented by extra work for the brighter individuals. 
Sometimes the supplementary work will be more of the 
same kind as covered in the minimum essentials; or 
again,/the more lengthy reports requiring more reading 
and organization can be given to the brighter pupils, and the 
shorter, more easily organized ones to the slower group. 
This avoids open division in the class since the latter 
group rarely recognizes that their assignments are less 
difficult than the others. In addition they thus obtain 
experience in gathering data and organizing and in

reporting to the class in terms of their abilities. There are 
other benefits in self-confidence, fun of participating, and 
time saved. 
Excellent examples of such assignments will be found 
throughout Mabel E. Simpson’s Supervised Study in Amer- 
can History, of which the following are illustrations :* 
Lesson Aim: What were the results of the Crusades? 
I. Minimum assignment: The effect of the Crusades on com- 
merce. 
1. Why did the Italian cities such as Venice and Genoa 
profit as a result of the Crusades? (p. 220.) 
2. Make a list of the articles the Venetians transported: 
a. From the East to the West. 
b. From the West to the East. 
3. How were these Eastern products distributed among the 
peoples of Europe? (p. 221.) 
II. Average assignment: What the people of Europe learned 
from the people of the East. : 
4, What were some of the things adopted by the people of 
Europe as a result of the journeys to the Holy Land? 
(W. and M., p. 171; G., p. 222.) 
5. In what other ways were the Crusades a benefit to the 
people during the Middle Ages? (G., pp. 223-228; 
N., pp. 223-231.) 
(A list of references is inserted here.) 
II. Maximum assignment: Questions prepared for to-morrow’s 
review. Pupils completing I and II may serve on a com- 
mittee which will prepare the questions for the class. 
These pupils should be allowed to work together quietly 
in one section of the room. The questions should aim to 
cover the important points in the lesson studied. If a 
large number reach the maximum, two committees might 
be formed—one to prepare the questions, the other to 
judge of their worth. 
Another type of assignment, involving a slightly differ- 
ent maximum report, will be found in the following: +

Lesson Aim: Why did European nations wish to explore and 
colonize the New World? 
I, Minimum assignment: 
1. Using Montgomery’s Leading Facts of American History 
as reference, find the countries of Europe most con- 
cerned in exploring the New World. 
2. Under the name of each country, make a list of all the 
explorers you can find who rendered valuable services. 
3. Write the date of exploration after the name of each ex- 
plorer you have found. 
4, After each name, list pages to show your source of 
information. 
II. Average assignment: 
5. Verify the work you have done by using Gordy’s History 
of the United States as a reference. Make any addi- 
tions necessary as a result of consulting the second 
reference. List all pages as directed in I. 4. 
III. Maximum assignment: : 
6. Write a paragraph at the board telling whether or not 
you consider our problem under consideration to-day 
to have been solved. Give your reasons for your 
answer. 
These two will serve to illustrate Miss Simpson’s gen- 
eral procedure and her book should be consulted by those 
interested in utilizing this scheme of assignment. 
In conclusion there should be noted a type of error very 
common with young teachers and with college teachers 
untrained in method; namely, assigning too much for any 
one to finish. The opposite error of assigning too little is 
less frequent. 
SuMMARY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
OBSERVATION OUTLINE ON THE ASSIGNMENT OF LESSONS 
1. Does the teacher show skill in placing the different types of 
assignments where they belong in the period? 
(a) Does she place at the beginning of the period those 
assignments that do not depend on the day’s lesson? 
   
-P-A-G-E-204

arise during the course of the recitation? Can she do 
this and slip back into the recitation with a minimum 
of disruption?

   OxsERVATION OUTLINE IN TERMS or Pup AorTivrry 
The following outline is merely a brief summary empha- 
sizing the principal points. The supervisor should review 
the outlines for the preparation step and for setting the 
model, both of which often partake of the nature of assign- 
ments. : 
1. Do the pupils raise new problems for solution as outgrowths 
of the one under discussion? Do they ask such questions 
as lead to such new problems? 
2. Do théy attempt to get better understanding and clearer 
wording of the problem by asking questions about it? By 
rewording themselves? 
3. Do they develop the finished statement of the problem, sub- 
heads if any, and the method of attack, through a dis- 
cussion freely participated in by all members of the 
group? 
4, Are they active and aggressive in outlining the problem? 
In suggesting methods of procedure? Do they assist in 
breaking the main problem into smaller ones, and in 
assigning these to groups within the class? 
5. Do they volunteer to be responsible for one of the sub-aims? 
For certain sources of information? For such extra work 
as arises in the course of the discussion? 
6. Do they volunteer information already in their possession? 
7. Do they ask questions that indicate a realization of the 
problems that will confront them when they attack the 
sources and begin to gather evidence? Do they recall 
any study rules or hints which may have been given them?
-P-A-G-E-206
186 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
8. Do they use notes or written outlines in lengthy assign- 
ments? 
9. If they ask each other questions about the assignment, do 
the questions indicate inattention by the pupil or insuffi- 
cient and hurried assignment by the teacher? 
10. Can they restate or outline briefly the problem? The general 
line of attack in summary form? 
11. The supervisor should note also the effect of varied assign- 
ments on the class. Whether they take it as a matter of 
course. Regard the longer assignments as a burden, a 
challenge, ete.? Do the slower ones hurry in an effort 
to do more than their ability warrants, become dis- 
couraged, ete.?

  CHAPTER IX 
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 
What Is Study?—Ever since books have been used in 
school, teachers have said to classes, ‘‘For to-morrow 
study pages 67 to 75,’’ or they have issued special warn- 
ings, ‘‘You will have to study hard on this lesson.’’ Be- 
fore books were used, lecturers referred to their classes 
as studying certain problems or topics. In everyday inter- 
course we often hear people say, ‘‘I’ll have to study on 
that a while before deciding.”’ ’ 
We are often astonished because people who are study- 
ing. the same problem in life as we are come to conclu- 
sions differing widely from our own. Why do some 
people make odd and peculiar blunders while studying 
out situations? Why do others become noted for their 
ability to take in hand a knotty situation and study it 
through to a just and fair conclusion? 
What do teachers mean when they say to a class, 
*‘Study pages 8 to 12,’’ or ‘‘Study hard’’? What do 
people do when they ‘‘study a thing over’’?? What en- 
ables sume people to study it out satisfactorily? What is 
responsible for faulty study processes on the part of 
others? These questions and other related ones, together 
with the great importance of the study process, have 
focused. attention on this phase of the learning process. 
Inquiries on the topic among teachers justified the con- 
vlusion that by study they themselves often meant 
memorization. In many cases children who studied in 
reality memorized and did little else. An analysis, how- 
ever, of what people do when they study on a problem in

-P-A-G-E-208
  188 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
real life and analysis of what children do when they study 
work upon problems of their own, unhampered by hay- 
ing to live up to what they know the teacher will call for, 
reveal a process quite different from memorization. 
Confronted with a problem, people usually form a con- 
clusion as to the solution very quickly. The untrained 
or stupid individual is satisfied with this first solution. 
he person who studies the problem, however, attempts to 
find the reasons back of his conclusion; he looks for addi- 
tional evidence with which to reject or uphold his tenta- 
tive solution. There is a process of searching for data; the 
individual ‘‘casts around in his mind’’ as we say. There 
is a movement back and forth between evidence and solu- 
tion until enough facts have been found to justify or break 
down the guess first made. In cases of considerable diffi- 
eulty, where no solution presents itself immediately, the 
individual who studies carefully before making a decision 
casts about for all the information he can find, weighs and 
organizes, and, finally, comes to a conclusion. During this 
study process he preserves open-mindedness. 
The following reports will show that children do some 
of the same things in so far as they are able when set to 
study upon problems in which they are interested, even 
though the problems themselves are not well assigned. A 
twelve-year-old girl in the seventh grade known as a good 
student stated that she did the erm’ things when she 
studied: 
(a) Read the lesson over. 
(b) Read about it in other books. 
(ce) Look up the words I do not know. 
(d) Make an outline or plan of each topic. 
(e) Put myself in place of one of the characters (history or 
literature). 
(f) Shut my eyes; think of it as a eerie one scene at a time. 
(g) In battles sometimes draw a plan. 
(h) Locate places mentioned on a map.
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 189 
A good student in the tenth grade reported his pro- 
cedure: 
(a) Read each separate paragraph to get main points. 
(6) Diseuss freely to. myself the main points and try to see 
relations. 
(c) Read it all over again to see if I have overlooked a point. 
(d) Look up the words I do not know. 
(e) Look in atlas for places mentioned. 
Poor students show a lack of any such system or plan 
of procedure: 
(a) Read the lesson over. 
(b) Read it again to see if I have it. 
Even worse is the youngster who writes, ‘‘I just hop 
to it till I get my lesson.’’ 
These reports and many more like them when analyzed 
show that the good students were trying to find additional 
data and relate them to their problems, or were trying to 
think in several ways regarding the data already found. 
From a careful analysis, then, of what people do in real 
life when confronted with problems requiring study and 
of what pupils do when not held rigidly for memorization 
of facts, the conclusion seems justified that the study 
process is the process of reflective thinking. This state- 
ment has probably been so transparently obvious to many 
people for a long time that it may sound absurd to state 
it directly. But the direct implication, namely, that ‘the 
technique of supervising study is the same as that involved 
in teaching lessons involving reflective thought, has not 
been so obvious, if we are to judge by some of the 
numerous attempts to discover the technique of supervised 
study. A vast number of experimental classes have been 
conducted, much theory has been advanced, and many 
administrative devices have been applied, all directed at
-P-A-G-E-210
  190 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
discovering ways and means of supervising study. An un- 
usually large number of the classes have been so conducted 
and much of the theory has been so written as to give the 
impression that something new, different, and unique was 
being evolved, whereas the matter of guiding and helping 
the student as he studies seems to be a matter of applying 
to him and to his individual difficulties much the same 
technique that is applied in the lessons that formulate 
generalizations or solve problems. 
Classification of Schemes for the Supervision of Study. 
—As stated above, there have been a large number of 
experimental studies of the study problem. Boiled down 
and analyzed by people not directly interested in the 
experiments, the results seem to reduce to this—that the 
slow students alone are helped and the bright ones are 
actually hindered by supervision. In very few of the 
accounts is any space or attention devoted to the most 
important phase of the matter, namely, the detailed tech- 
nique of supervision—what went on during the period. 
Attention seems to have been focused on the subject mat- 
ter used, the administrative devices, and the testing at the 
end of the experiment rather than upon what happened to 
bring about these results. This is well shown in the set 
of conclusions advanced by Breed? on the basis of an 
extensive and highly scientific experiment. The careful 
work of this experimenter has done much to clear away 
the smoke screen of enthusiastic but unscientific claims 
advanced by many less exact workers. 
1. On the basis of average results for the whole class, work in 
algebra was a little less efficient under supervised study, English 
composition a great deal less efficient, and Latin alone stood out 
as showing great benefit from supervision. & 
2. Supervised study facilitated the progress of the slow pupil

Review, vol. 28, pp. 186-204 and 261-284.
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 191 
but to a correspondingly greater degree hindered the bright 
" one. 
3. The divided, or double-period, plan is not to be recom- 
mended until its efficiency is better proved than it has been to 
date. 
: 4, There should probably be a selective or differential plan 
concentrating on the slow pupils. 
5. The technique of supervising poor pupils needs to be im- 
proved; that of supervising bright pupils needs to be developed. 
An excellent summary of other experiments in the field, 
together with an analysis of theories and administrative 
devices, will be found in Hall-Quest, Supervised Study. 
This volume should be studied by supervisors interested in 
this matter. An analysis of Hall-Quest’s summaries, to- 
gether with a study of recent magazine reports, of which 
Breed’s is a good example, will lead the reader to classify 
all of the schemes for supervision into two big general 
groups. Hither the emphasis is upon the supervision of 
students who are studying at their desks, or the emphasis is 
upon adapting methods of instruction in the regular classes 
to the end that students will be trained in the elements of 
the study process. 
Supervision of Pupils Who Are Studying at Their 
Desks.—This point of view is well discussed by Parker, 
whose treatment is summarized by Hall-Quest : 7 
1. The supervision of individual students who are studying 
silently at their seats should replace a considerable part of the 
time now spent on recitations and home study. 
2. Poor students especially fail to profit under the system of 
recitations based upon home study. 
3. Precisely measured, experimental investigations show that 
supervised study improves the work of the poor student.

-P-A-G-E-212
192 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
    vised study, should be arranged as regular parts of the daily pro- 
gramme in most high-school subjects. 
5. Conditions favorable to study are those favorable to con- 
centration of attention. 
(a) Physical conditions and certain routine habits may be 
easily improved. { 
(b) Spontaneous attention and concentrated thinking are 
more difficult to secure, but are essential. 
6. A special technique of supervising study should be mastered. 
by teachers. It should include: 
(a) Skill in determining the character of progress being 
made by students while they are studying. 
(6) Skill in stimulating and aiding this progress by means 
of questions and suggestions, without aiding too much. 
Breed’s experiment, published later than Parker’s book, 
easts some suspicion upon the divided period, but this is 
still probably a good device provided that the time is 
utilized skillfully by an expert teacher. The last con- 
elusions noted by Parker seem to point to the guidance of 
reflective thinking as the central element. Several plans 
attempting to realize these conclusions have been worked 
out and are in operation. Most of them apply to the high 
school but contain suggestions for the upper grades as 
well. Conferences may be provided for; either poor 
students are required to report or they ask for help as they 
need it. Teachers are provided with time for such work 
or part of each period is used. Closely related to this 
plan is the one of having two teachers in charge of a room, 
one to teach and one to help those studying. Or, an 
extra teacher can be given two or three grades to coach in 
study habits. 
The directions given for the teacher’s procedure in these 
different schemes all stress the matter of finding the 
student’s difficulty and aiding him to solve it. He should 
not have the difficulty pointed out for him or the solution 
given to him unless the situation is hopeless. The diffi- 
culties cited all revolve around some element in thinking,  
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 193 
finding the real problem, sources of information, organ- 
ization of evidence, or the discovery of obscure and hidden 
relationships between facts. 
Training Pupils to Study by Means of Better Instruction 
in the Regular Lessons.—Attempts have been made in 
many places to so administer the method of teaching in 
the subjects requiring reflective thinking that the student 
would acquire through example and practice the process 
of studying out problems by himself. Such lessons are 
often called ‘‘how-to-study’’ lessons or contribution or 
socialized recitations. Obviously the technique of the 
teacher would be that outlined in Chapter V. 
After thorough training in such lessons the teacher 
might call the attention of the class to the factors in the 
process, so that the process might be applied independ- 
ently. Many hot arguments have raged regarding the pos- 
sibility of such recognition and application. No one 
claims that pupils will acquire and transfer a technique 
that does not stand out clearly or one of which they are 
not clearly aware. However, there can be no doubt that 
older students, after having been through many lessons 
involving the process of gathering and organizing infor- 
mation, making and verifying inferences, or analyzing 
instances for the purpose of arriving at general laws, 
should be able in some measure to see the process separate 
from the material upon which it has been exercised and to 
apply it to new problems. This will be especially true if 
their attention is called directly to the procedure involved. 
If such teaching could be done throughout the grades, it 
is reasonable to think that the need for supervised study, 
so evident at present, would eventually disappear. 
E. D. Merriam, quoted by Hall-Quest, looks upon the class 
hour as essentially a laboratory hour and not a period of 
reiteration or of memory exhibition. The important thing, 
in his estimation, is to arouse the pupils to work econom-
-P-A-G-E-214
  194 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
ically and effectively. He has worked out a set of study 
directions which in one way or another stress the method of 
teaching that will enable the students to attack new prob- 
lems more effectively and to grow in such power. 
The period is lengthened and divided into three parts, 
one for assignment, one for study, and one for recitation. 
Dr. Merriam even goes so far as to say that eventually the 
recitation, as such, should not be necessary. There may 
be some question regarding the elimination of the recita- 
tion for the slower pupils, but for the brighter ones such 
an outcome is quite possible. In some experimental schools 
at the present there is no recitation in the formal sense. 
Another attempt to train students in methods of study is 
discussed in a most interesting and helpful little volume by 
H. B. Wilson, Training Pupils to Study. It follows quite 
elosely MeMurry’s discussion of the elements in study 
but makes them much more specific. Definite suggestions 
for different grades and subjects and specific applications 
to actual cases are given, together with stenographic 
reports of supervised-study lessons. The underlying idea 
seems to be the teaching of study habits through better 
teaching of those lessons involving reflective thought. 
There are many helpful suggestions in the book that can 
be utilized by both teachers and supervisors. 
One of the most important recent books in this field is 
Supervised Study in American History by Miss Mabel E. 
Simpson of Rochester, New York. While there might be 
some disagreement with Miss Simpson’s terminology and 
designation of lesson types, there can be little criticism 
of her skillful use of the varied assignment or of her clear- 
eut directions regarding the conduct of the study period. 
Her book is one of real value to teachers and supervisors. 
Her organization of the class period is like Dr. Mer- 
riam’s, part for assignment, part for study, part for recita- 
tion. She uses silent study periods during which the
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 195 
teacher gives individual help, but she also uses the type of 
teaching that directs the students’ study process while 
they are in class, thus combining both types of supervised 
study. 
Types of Problems the Study Supervisor Will Meet.— 
The big defect in most of the supervised-study literature 
is that there is very little specific discussion of the actual 
procedure to be followed by the teacher. Such a discus- 
sion could be worked out by a teacher or group of teachers 
on the basis of several months’ detailed supervision work. 
It would include illustrations of many actual cases of 
pupil-difficulty and teacher-help. It would, however, be a 
voluminous piece of writing. The best that can be done 
here is to list the general classes of problems that are 
likely to arise and to suggest general principles under 
which to operate. 
Lack of Interest—Many pupils have difficulty studying, 
not because they are incapable or because the material is 
difficult, but because there is no desire really to work. 
There is no underlying urge, even though the student 
thinks he is trying to work. Good work cannot be done 
unless there is interest and attention. The teacher must 
make the intrinsic worth of the material so clear that it 
supplies motive or she must make an appeal to some 
natural interest. Occasionally such cases are disciplinary 
rather than pedagogical and must be dealt with accord- 
ingly. 
In many instances the study supervisor’s attention 
should be directed not directly upon the pupil but upon 
his home conditions, work and play activities, and his 
past school record. A fourth-grade boy who appeared to 
be normal in every way failed everything in the fifth 
grade and was sent to me for examination. He seemed 
a little listless, but not markedly so. He was willing and 
docile, his intelligence quotient was normal, and he seemed  
-P-A-G-E-216
196 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  to have no physical defects, but he did not progress. In- 
quiry, however, revealed the fact that he arose at four 
o’clock in the morning and helped his father milk a num- 
ber of cows, walked four miles to school, had a cold lunch 
at noon, and walked back just in time to assist with the 
chores and evening milking. This youngster did not have 
energy left with which to do the work, no matter what the 
appeal. Many times inquiry will reveal home conditions 
or physical defects that are inimical to the pupil’s best 
efforts in study. Seemingly dull pupils are often made 
over through remedial measures applied early enough. 
There are a vast number of physical conditions other than 
those briefly referred to here, and the supervisor is re- 
ferred to Chapter IV in Hall-Quest for a better discussion 
of such factors. 
Inability to See the Problem Clearly—Many pupils’ 
difficulties in studying resolve themselves into a lack of 
understanding of what they are to do. Even when the 
assignment is clearly and definitely made and seemingly 
clear to everyone, there will be a few individuals who do 
not know what to do and, furthermore, who do not know 
exactly what is the matter. Here, if anywhere, a teacher 
is justified in giving direct assistance. A word or two, a 
brief explanation, will often make definite and concrete a 
problem that was vague and hazy, offering no avenue of 
approach or criterion of judgment to be applied to data. 
That is, the teacher may restate the aim or reset the 
model. Care must be taken, of course, to see that such 
procedure is not followed in the ease of the lazy, inatten- 
tive pupil, who will be better served, probably, by a little 
sharp treatment. 
Lack of Knowledge of Sources—Quite often students 
come to a halt and are unaware that more information is 
what is wanted. Or again, they may appreciate the lack 
of knowledge but not know where to look for it. In some
-P-A-G-E-217
: THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 197 
eases definite reference should be made to sufficient 
sources in the assignment. But the pupil must be held 
more and more for responsibility in finding other sources 
than those given and for the particular sources to use in 
finding certain types of information. This involves teach- 
ing pupils to use dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, guides 
to periodical literature, ete. There should be direct, care- 
fully planned lessons for some of these things and later 
pupils should be expected to use them independently. 
Not only must pupils find sourees but they must be 
trained to judge the worth of them. In a lesson on Mexico 
one little girl reported that the best way to help Mexico 
would be to go there with an army and clean up the 
country. Asked why she thought so, she replied, ‘‘Mamma 
says that since Mexico is just a little place about as big 
as Arizona we could conquer it quickly.’’ While it is 
usually dangerous for a teacher to discuss what ‘‘ Mamma 
says,’’ this pupil was set to work comparing Mexico with 
other countries and states in regard to area and popula- 
tion. It proved a valuable exercise for her in the matter 
of judging reliability of sources. 
Inability to Judge the Worth of Facts.—Obviously pupils 
are not discriminating between facts and ideas when they 
attempt to remember everything they read or when they 
advance any one fact as of equal value with any other. 
This is one of the most difficult phases of study super- 
vision. The fault is easily recognized but difficult to 
remedy. Sometimes a fact given by a pupil is so incon- 
sequential that it could be totally eliminated from the 
discussion without loss. Or questions are asked that indi- 
cate a lack of knowledge as to the issues of the lesson. 
Elaboration of such cases will assist the pupil in seeing the 
relative values of facts. Attempts to have the pupil con- 
nect the idea or information definitely and directly with 
the question being solved will help to set up a criterion 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  198 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
of judgment. To pm a pupil ane for exact relationships 
between his statements and the class discussion is a good 
device. Training students how and when to skim and 
read rapidly and when to read slowly and carefully is 
beneficial. | 
In discussing this phase of study with a sixth-grade 
class the teacher advised them to read several books and 
select such facts as bore on the lesson. One boy asked, 
*‘How do we know what is wanted?’’ and another an- 
swered immediately, ‘‘You can tell by looking at the set 
of questions on the board.’’ This shows that some of the 
pupils realize the point at issue here while others are quite 
at sea. Later on in the same lesson someone mentioned 
reading paragraphs or pages to get the ‘‘main thought,”’ 
and the same boy said, ‘‘What gets me is how you know 
your real main thought’’! Probably the teacher could 
have said that it would ‘‘get’’ her if she had to explain 
fully how one does know. But this is an important diffi- 
eulty in study and the teacher must try such devices as 
the particular case suggests. Asking such questions as 
“Do these facts relate to the problem?’’ ‘‘Do they aid in 
answering any of the study questions?’’ ‘‘Do they seem to 
contradict any other facts you have gathered?”’ etc., will 
all help the pupil to set up a standard of judgment in 
regard to facts and eventually he will ask these questions 
of himself. If pupils manifest a marked and continued 
inability to answer these questions while studying, they 
are probably retarded. But we should be extremely 
eautious in deciding that it is a case of ‘‘continued and 
marked inability.’’ All other possible causes for such a 
condition should be sought out first. 
Difficulties with Organization —Many grown-ups as well 
as children become swamped with information. They for- 
get whether or not certain sources have been consulted. 
They remember finding certain facts and discussions but
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 199 
do not remember where, nor have they any notes. If notes 
are taken, they are often not in outline form and there is 
no key to the material. Other problems arise from in- 
ability to see that the search for data has gone far 
enough. This is because there is no system of quick ref- 
erence to what has been done. The use of the outline 
should be taught either in the course of the regular les- 
sons or as a separate formula. Diagrams, charts, and fig- 
ures to represent relations between facts are easily mas- 
tered by fifth-grade pupils and should be used. All the 
devices the teacher can use to cause pupils to ‘‘take 
stock,’’ to organize into compact form, or to represent 
graphically what has been done will assist in this difficulty. 
Difficulties Arising in Drawing Inferences or Making 
Generalizations Closely related to the difficulties involved 
in gathering evidence or analyzing situations are the 
problems that arise in the making of guesses or inferences 
on the basis of the information gathered or the analysis 
made. Sometimes the pupil’s reaction to the problem will 
take the form of a wild guess. Before help can be given 
the teacher must inquire into the possible causes of the 
statement. 
A little girl was asked what difficulties probably con- 
fronted the Swiss people in forming their government 
and she replied, ‘‘Trouble with the Indians.’’ Evidently 
her study of the American struggle for independence was 
in her mind and this answer popped out. In many cases, 
however, the guesses will apparently have no basis in 
past experience and seem to be made for no reason. Skill- 
ful questioning by the teacher is called for, and often a 
basis will be found in an erroneous apperceptive process. 
Failing this the pupil should be asked to show how his 
remark bears on the question or how it is justified by the 
evidence. Requiring analysis from the pupils will even- 
tually train them to base their inferences on better evi-
-P-A-G-E-220
200 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  dence. Obviously a part of the difficulty is the inability 
of young pupils to suspend judgment. The talkative, 
superficial pupil, the bluffer, and the one with flighty atten- 
tion are the chief offenders in bringing in answers that 
have no very thorough basis of evidence. These pupils 
also manifest an ability to construct elaborate inferences 
on the flimsiest of foundations. Holding such pupils for 
analysis and explanation is the best device probably, 
though they almost become disciplinary cases in some 
instances. 
It should be noted in passing that some dull or slow 
children make wild guesses because they cannot keep up 
with the thought of the class, and the teacher’s attitude 
will be different in such cases. 
Difficulties with Analysis—Often in arithmetic or gram- 
mar the pupil is unable to tell which rule to apply, which 
procedure to follow, and what to do next. The teacher’s 
questions will then be directed toward analyzing and out- 
lining the problem so that its principal parts will stand 
out. Often the difficulty is in the language or in a neg- 
ative statement which a question or two will help clear up. 
If the inability is marked and continued, the trouble prob- 
ably lies in the original learning. If this can be deter- 
mined to have been insufficient, the pupil must be sent 
back to do more work in the fundamentals. 
In the content subjects this difficulty can usually be met 
by referring students to sources of information or by 
applying some of the devices set forth in Chapter V for 
aiding in analysis. 
Memorizing in Study.—The foregoing discussion should 
not lead one to believe that memorizing does not play a 
large part in study. The emphasis is rather upon dis- 
lodging memory from its position of the past, in which it 
has been practically synonymous with study. Psycho- 
logically, facts are remembered better when they are
-P-A-G-E-221
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 201 
learned by means of a thought process than if held by 
rote memory. In the former case many associations are 
formed and the material can be reached from several 
angles. Therefore the thought process here elaborated 
as the real study process is itself a definite aid to memory. 
In addition it selects the facts worth memorizing more 
efficiently than did the older method of study. The rules 
of practice elaborated in Chapter VII should be applied 
to the memorization of facts that are valuable enough to 
warrant making automatic. 
The Assignment and the Recitation in Relation to Study. 
—Obviously, both the method and type of assignment and 
the conduct of the recitation period are vital factors in the 
study process. No repetition from Chapter VII is neces- 
sary here to show explicitly the relation of assignment to 
study. 
If the recitation is a period in which isolated, formal 
facts are called for, the study process will degenerate into 
memorization and no real power will result for the pupil. 
But if it is a period in which thinking is done, in which ques- 
tions directly stimulate thought, in which time is allowed 
for thought to take place, and in which references can be 
studied and evaluated as they are necessary, then the 
ability to attack and study new problems should be grad- 
ually acquired by the pupils. The conduct of the recita- 
tion will be elaborated upon in the next chapter. 
General Point of View for the Teacher.—The teacher in 
supervised study should regard herself as a diagnostician 
whose duty is to find the specific difficulty and prescribe a 
remedy. This means that she must be highly trained in all 
the general principles of educational psychology. She 
must have time to work with pupils and discover their 
individual difficulties. Above all, she must be expert at 
discovering the mental processes of her students and expert 
in directing and guiding these processes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
202 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  In all her supervision and help she should be dominated 
by the idea of so helping that she enables the pupil to find 
and correct his own difficulty and thus gain in power. A 
teacher who does the work for the pupil, explains ex- 
plicitly, or allows herself to be used as a crutch is a detri- 
ment instead of a help in study. The instance is related 
of a study coach who was ‘‘worked’’ by pupils who came 
after school for help. She explained so clearly and com- 
pletely that the pupils copied the work as fast as they 
could. In the morning they could put the problems on 
the board correctly but could not explain them or work 
new ones involving the same principles. 
Objections to Supervised Study.—Few objections to 
supervised study are found in the literature on the subject. 
This is probably because most of this literature was written 
by people who were describing their own plans of work. 
However, many of the more recent experimental studies 
point out, as quoted above, that there are some defects and 
that all is not gain as was supposed. These statements are 
not objections but are in the nature of guidance for a shift 
in emphasis. 
One town registered a complaint that is undoubtedly 
unique in the history of education. Supervised study was 
so efficient that the pupils had no home work and were free 
for so long in the afternoons and evenings that the parents 
had difficulty in controlling them. This is cited merely as a 
matter of interest, since obviously there is no real objection 
to supervised study in the statement. 
However, there is a class of objections registered quite 
often by teachers and others that center on the factor of 
assistance given to the pupil by means of supervised study. 
The answer to these objections is well summarized in Hall- 
Quest : 
  
* Op. cit., p. 23.
-P-A-G-E-223
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 203 
The objection often urged that supervised study prevents the 
pupil from relying on himself is answered sufficiently by sug- 
gesting that without it he does not rely upon himself, but 
instead enlists family, friends, and classmates in his behalf. 
Home study is harmful, not only because unhygienic but also 
because it tempts the pupil to claim as his own work what others 
have done for him. Problems in mathematics, theme writing, and 
outline work are referred to others whenever feasible to do so. 
This is natural, The difficulties are severe, the assignments are 
unreasonably long, and class marks are usually impersonal. 
What is a pupil to do? Let him without offense in this type of 
home study cast the first stone. 
Supervised study means working with the pupil but not for 
him. It is preventive. It deals not merely with subject matter 
but with the methods of learning it, and for this reason it is 
necessary that the teacher for a considerable time devote part 
or all of the class period to this fundamental of learning. The 
... pupil must be taught how to think, how to organize, and 
how to apply. 
These objections then would seem to be based upon a mis- 
conception of the real meaning of the term. 
Which Plan Should Be Selected for the Organization of 
Supervised Study?—It matters little whether the emphasis 
be placed upon supervision of students at their desks or 
placed upon better methods of teaching. The conditioning 
factors in the particular situation are the time available and 
the training of the teachers. 
In either case time must be provided. In the first type 
of supervision either the period is doubled, extra periods 
are provided, or extra teachers are allotted to care for 
students during study periods. Any of several plans of 
time and teacher administration will be successful. The 
second plan, that of emphasizing teaching methods, also 
involves lengthening the period, but the big factor is the 
training of the teacher. This plan, more than the other,, 
calls for experts, though highly trained teachers are vital 
in both. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
204 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  In either plan there should be a selective mechanism to 
determine which pupils need supervision. Usually a 
series of tests and measurements will serve this end. The 
other pupils should study as they wish or be excused from 
a percentage of the recitations and directed to extra work. 
The activities of actual supervision, as has been em- 
phasized throughout this chapter, reduce in either event 
to the activities of guiding and stimulating thought. 
The foregoing points in regard to supervised study are 
well summarized by Hall-Quest:* 
Supervised study is that plan of school procedure whereby 
each pupil is so adequately instructed and directed in the methods 
of studying and thinking, that his daily preparation will progress 
under conditions most favorable to a hygienic, economical, and 
self-reliant career of intellectual endeavor. It seeks to prepare 
pupils not simply for high-school graduation or courses in higher 
education, but to an even greater extent for successful coping 
with problems in a world of intense competition, where superior 
achievement depends on initiative, clear thinking, and confidence 
in one’s ability to organize experience for new adjustments, 
What is aimed at in supervised study is an individual who is 
trained to attack problems and to organize experiences into large 
controlling concepts, and who, moreover, has acquired the ability 
to initiate or to serve without merely doing what he is told to do. 
The world of business is choked with unthinking imitators who, 
parrot-like, repeat exactly what has been said, but who cannot 
be depended upon to perform a task without being given con- 
stant and minute directions. 
The world at large, business, and professions are crying for 
independent thinkers, men and women who see a task and who 
ean readily work toward its successful accomplishment without 
being watched at every step. College needs them. Pitiful is the 
ignorance of students in a library, or in their attempt to make 
an original report. Inaccuracies, haste, confusion abound. But 
they were able to enter college simply because they had certain 
units of subject matter! The world smiles and sneers at our 
ludicrous formalism. The time is ripe for another class of young 
people. Our high schools must face the need of producing young 
  4 Ibid., p. 29.
-P-A-G-E-225
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 205 
people who in every phase of school life have been taught the 
meaning of and have been trained in the exercise of accurate, 
organized, independent, and practical thinking. 
Hall-Quest’s discussion is in terms of high-school subjects 
and pupils, but the same points apply to the grade pupils 
as well. 
Shall the Elements of the Study Process Be Given to 
Pupils Directly?—Objections to acquainting the pupil 
with the factors in study have nearly disappeared. After 
pupils have had lessons assigned properly and carefully, 
after they have worked these assignments out carefully, 
after they have participated in recitations calling for free 
discussion, evaluation of information, and inference, they 
should be able to grasp the elements of a good study process. 
In fact the brighter pupils have it already. The few who 
cannot get and apply it independently will probably be in 
the lower ten per cent of the class. It is not expected that 
all can be taught to study and think independently. As 
has been stated above, it is reasonable to hope that after 
a pupil has passed through several grades of the best 
teaching, he will be so equipped that supervised study will 
be unnecessary. This condition will probably be deferred 
for a long time to come, and the first step toward it would 
seem to be to raise the standards of teacher-training upon 
every opportunity. 
The Use of Books in Study.—Obviously in study there 
must be considerable use of books as sources of information. 
Much of the search for data, much of the inspection of a 
problem, and a great deal of verification will be accom- 
plished by reading books. The proper use of books, includ- 
ing the use of tables of contents, marginal headings, indexes, 
ete., has already been mentioned in this chapter and 
in the preceding one. These factors in study should be 
taught through use as they arise during regular lessons or 
by means of lessons for that purpose.
-P-A-G-E-226
206 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
However, there is an important point in regard to the 
use of books that is often overlooked. There is a great deal 
of reading or studying of books that is not a part of any 
definite thinking exercise. While Thorndike’s tests of 
reading do emphasize that ‘‘reading is active selective 
thinking,’’ nevertheless much reading by bibliographers or 
experts in a given field is rapid reading for the purpose 
simply of seeing what is in a book or article. There is no 
open searching for data to apply to a problematic situation 
or to build into a generalization as there is in thinking. 
The individual runs through the book rapidly to determine 
its point of view and general content. He usually attempts 
to remember these two things plus some specific statements. 
The hair-splitting critic will say, perhaps, that there is in 
reality a problem in the back of the reader’s mind and thus 
his reading is in the nature of thinking. This may be true, 
but the factors in active selective thinking are more sub- 
ordinate than prominent. It seems legitimate, therefore, 
to call the teacher’s attention to the fact that people study 
books in order to discover in general the content and point 
of view, as well as to use them in active thinking processes. 
This phase of studying is apart from the general technique 
ef the process as set forth in this chapter and deserves 
special treatment. The application of reading tests for 
vocabulary, for speed, and for comprehension will be found 
helpful in this matter. The manuals published with many 
reading tests and such books as bear on the whole field of 
testing and improving skill will be of value to both teacher 
and supervisor. 
Should Home Study Be Done Away With?—If super- 
vised study is to make for independence in attacking and 
studying new problems, obviously there must be definite 
provision for other study than that done at school under 
the eye of the teacher. Furthermore, if learning is to 
approximate life whenever possible, it must be a continuous 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 207 
process both in and out of school. Supervised study should 
not, as some think, supplant home study entirely. Project 
teaching that involves work both in and out of school and 
that stresses continuity of effort will do much to place 
study in its proper relation to the rest of the learning 
process. 
Physical Conditions Favorable to Study.—Most of the 
general treatises, and a few of the experimental studies on 
this topic, devote some space to the effect of physical con- 
ditions on study. However, it is to be noted that in super- 
vised study which is done at school many of the physical con- 
ditions are relatively fixed by the room and building. Since 
it is done at regularly appointed periods, the matter of 
study programmes and of individual work habits is of less 
importance. There are also many other factors which affect 
study very vitally but which are beyond the teacher’s control 
in large measure, such as food, sleep, amusement and recrea- 
tion, home life, health work attitude, ete. The best dis- 
cussion of these things will be found in Hall-Quest, Super- 
vised Study, Chapter IV. The teacher should read Hall- 
Quest, Parker, Whipple, Kitson, Sandwick, and others to 
gather a rather complete knowledge of these outside factors 
in study. They should then be presented to the pupils 
directly in lessons or talks. The codperation of both pupils 
and parents with the school is to be sought. For checking 
up on physical conditions in the supervised-study room the 
discussion and outline given in Chapter III will be 
applicable. 
SumMMary FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
To restate: supervised study is a device for adapting 
instruction more fully to individual differences and needs. 
It involves: a selective mechanism to determine those in 
need of help; definite allowance of time for giving this help; 
and supplementary work for those who do not need the
-P-A-G-E-228
  208° SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
help. It seems to be immaterial in the end whether this 
help takes the form of individual help during a period 
specifically designated as the supervised-study period or 
takes the form of better teaching involving stress on the 
factors of study and adaptation to difference by means 
of’ minimum, average, and maximum assignments. The 
first type will probably be regarded as true supervised 
study by most people, though the latter is none the less an 
effective device in teaching how to study. 
When the supervisor is called upon to install a system 
of supervised study, he must first devise the selective 
mechanism, probably a series of tests. The teaching 
periods must then be lengthened or extra periods pro- 
vided. The vitally conditioning factor of the teacher’s 
ability must be carefully considered. The scheme to be 
used must be clearly and completely explained to the 
teachers who are to participate. Not only must the teach- 
ers thoroughly understand the plan, but they must be 
sympathetic toward it. If they are not already so, every 
effort must be made to win them over, since a plan they 
do not like will have difficulty in succeeding. 
The supervisor should visit supervised-study periods as 
he would any other class exercise and endeavor to assist 
the teacher. In case study is being taught through em- 
phasis on better teaching, his guidance will be obtained 
from those outlines already discussed in earlier chapters. 
He should check up as usual on the physical, routine, and 
disciplinary conditions, but his greatest attention will be 
upon the teacher’s ability to stimulate thought. The out- 
lines at the end of Chapters IV and V should be used here, 
and both teacher and supervisor should work for more 
emphasis than usual upon the recognition by the pupils of 
the elements in thinking and studying. In addition there 
should be direct reference to these factors of study and 
also to physical conditions, outside activities, study pro- 
grammes and work habits, home conditions, ete. 
In case the plan in use is that of individual supervision 
of students at their desks, the following outline will be of
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 209 
help in guiding the supervisor’s observation. With the 
teacher’s permission he should himself engage in the work, 
asking pupils about their difficulties and attempting to 
assist them. The teacher should feel free to ask for advice 
on difficult cases and to discuss her procedure in the cases 
she disposes of. 
OBSERVATION OUTLINE ON SUPERVISED STUDY 
1. Are the physical conditions within the room (heat, light, 
ventilation, noise, ete.) the best possible, considering the 
means at the teacher’s disposal? 
2. Are reference books, dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc., acces- 
sible and well placed? Do the pupils use these in a quiet 
and orderly manner? Is such passing and communication 
as is necessary well routinized? 
3. Is interest initiated and maintained? Are pupils kept at 
work? Are those excused adequately provided for? Are 
disturbances calling for disciplinary measures handled 
quietly and effectively? 
4. Is the studying an active, aggressive process? Does the 
teacher avoid undue dominance? When necessary are 
small groups set to work together? Can they work to- 
gether quietly and purposefully? Can they find, prepare, 
and report new data? 
5. Does the teacher adapt and apply to individual difficulties 
the general technique for stimulating thought as outlined 
in Chapter V? (This is of course the crucial thing in 
supervised study and involves the application of a multi- 
tude of points. The discussion should be re-read and be 
clearly in mind when assisting a teacher.) 
a. Is she quick to see the real difficulty? 
b. Skillful in probing for it when it is not immediately ap- 
parent? 
6. Does she make note of those pupils whose difficulties go back 
to insufficient learning of formal associations and skills, 
and see that they get extra drill as they need it? 
7. When a difficulty is found to be fairly prevalent with a 
majority of the class, does she stop the group and discuss 
it for the benefit of all? Is there direct reference from 
time to time regarding the factors of study? Regarding

physical conditions, health, home conditions, study pro- 
gramme, work habits, outside activities, etc.? 
8. Is the sum total of the teacher’s efforts directed toward the 
development in the pupil of the ability actively and in- 
dependently to attack and study new problems?

THE PROJECT METHOD 
Probably more articles have been written in recent years 
upon the project method than upon any other topic in the 
field of method. It is inevitable that in so vast a literature 
as has been developed there will be found considerable rub- 
bish. A number of weird pedagogical and psychological 
arguments have been advanced in support of what was 
supposed to be project teaching, while the projects them- 
selves have been of every conceivable type and form. Many 
bulletins have been published purporting to report or out- 
line projects when, as a matter of fact, they contained a 
course of study or a list of isolated lesson topics arranged 
in a sequence. 
Attempts to Define the Project—A review of those 
writers competent to discuss method, however, indicates an 
agreement that the project is of vital importance and that 
its elaboration will constitute a real contribution. There is 
some disagreement in regard to definition and details of 
organization or administration. The brief summary of 
opinion given below should be supplemented by the student 
through the bibliography. 
Very early Snedden attempted to set the project off from 
other types of teaching or learning; though his definition 
is not complete or exact, he places + 
. emphasis upon a unit of activity resulting in purposeful, 
concrete achievement, the aim being realized through a utilization

of the acquired skills and experiences of the child, and related 
skills and experiences which he necessarily acquired in working 
out the project. 
2”? ‘‘Whole-hearted, purposeful activity’’ is stressed as the 
essential by Kilpatrick, who has devoted considerable time 
and study to the problem. A learning process dominated 
by the whole-hearted desires and purposes of the pupil 
utilizes to the fullest the opportunities of the situation. It 
differs from the all too common passive learning process in 
that the pupil secures more of what Kilpatrick calls ‘‘asso- 
ciate and concomitant responses,’’ in addition to the direct 
or ‘‘primary responses.’? That is, the whole-hearted inter- 
est of the pupil leads him to secure much additional and 
related information and many related skills he would 
neither know about nor pay attention to under the passive 
process of absorption. Unlike many advocates of ‘‘pupils’ 
purposes and desires,’’ Kilpatrick sounds a warning against 
the subordination of teacher and school to childish whim. 
The teacher must guide and in some instances dominate. 
By directing, gently or otherwise, the natural interests 
and purposes of the pupils, the class can be led to make 
certain useful and worthy purposes and activities their 
own. 
This writer classifies projects as follows: ? 
Type 1, where the purpose is to embody some idea or plan in 
external form, as building a boat, writing a letter, presenting a 
play. Type 2, where the purpose is to enjoy some (esthetic) 
experience, as listening to a story, hearing a symphony, appre- 
ciating a picture. Type 3, where the purpose is to straighten out 
some intellectual difficulty, to solve some problem, as to find out 
whether or not dew falls, to ascertain how New York outgrew 
Philadelphia. Type 4, where the purpose is to obtain some degree 
or item of skill or knowledge, as learning to write Grade 14 on 
the Thorndike Seale, or learning the irregular verbs in French.

It is at once evident that these groupings more or less overlap 
and that one type may be used as means to another as end... 
For Type 1 the following steps have been suggested: pur- 
posing, planning, executing, and judging. It is in accord with the 
general theory here advocated that the child as far as possible 
take each step himself. Total failure, however, may hurt more 
than assistance. The opposed dangers seem to be... that the 
child may not come out master of the process, ... or that he 
may waste time. The teacher must steer the child through these 
narrows, taking care meantime to avoid the other dangers pre- 
viously discussed. The function of the purpose and the place of 
thinking in the process need but be mentioned. Attention may be 
ealled to the fourth step, that the child as he grows older may 
increasingly judge the result in terms of the aim and with in- 
creasing care and success draw from the process its lessons for 
the future. 
Type 2... may seem to some hardly to belong in the list. . . . 
I have, as yet, no definite procedure steps to point out. 
Type 3, that of the problem, is of all the best known, owing to 
the work of Professors Dewey and McMurry. The steps that 
have been used are those of the Dewey analysis of thought. This 
type lends itself, next to Type 4, best of all to our ordinary school- 
room work. For this reason I have feared its over-emphasis. 
Our schools—at least in my judgment—do emphatically need a 
great increase in the social activity possible in Type 1. 
Type 4... would seem to call for the same steps as Type 1, 
purposing, planning, executing, and judging. Only here, the 
planning had perhaps best come from the psychologist .. . 
danger of over-emphasis here . . . some teachers may not dis- 
criminate between drill as a project and drill as a set task . . . 
Type 3 is probably not essentially different from lessons 
involving reflective thought as outlined in Chapter V and 
as taught by many experienced teachers before they knew 
of the project method as such. Types 1 and 4 involve much 
of the procedure outlined in Chapters VI and VII, plus an 
emphasis on the opportunity for the pupil to set up his 
own model or to exercise the utmost initiative and original- 
ity in adapting the model given by the teacher or selected 
by the class.

THE PROJECT METHOD 215 
  It will be seen that the emphasis in the foregoing has been 
upon the subjective or pupil-purpose side of the situation. 
Another large group of writers place their emphasis more 
upon the side of social utility, objectivity, ete. The differ- 
ence between the two can best be shown by Horn’s statement 
in an unpublished manuscript: ‘‘Under one scheme pupils 
bake cakes becaus@"they propose to bake them. In the other 
they bake cakes because that is the way to learn to bake 
eakes.’’ Of course, the knowledge that the socially useful 
skill can best be learned by doing it might supply the 
purpose for the undertaking, thus bringing the two views 
more into accord. This latter meaning for project, involy- 
ing practical social utility, is, however, very probably the 
one under which this type of lesson originally came into 
being. 
Charters regards the project as a complex problem ear- 
ried to solution in its natural setting and for the purpose 
of further use of the results attained. This would include 
a great deal of shop work and part-time education where 
book work and outside work are given attention. Miller in 
his Education for the Needs of Life has a very sane and 
sensible discussion of the whole topic in which he defines * 
the project briefly as ‘‘a practical enterprise undertaken 
by a pupil or group of pupils.’”’ After giving some sug- 
gestive illustrations, he points out that this new method is 
not a panacea but is profoundly affecting the organization of 
eurricula and the application of principles of learning. 
Among the advantages of the method he lists opportunity 
for the cultivation of initiative and originality, self-activity, 
and enterprise. Motive is more easily introduced and has a 
stronger hold upon the learner. Training in the funda- 
mental skills and knowledges is well cared for in the course 
of the project.

Horn for some time urged strongly that the term project 
be standardized. The following brief summary of his views 
and classification of projects is based upon lecture notes 
from his classes, though his views will doubtless be found in 
the literature soon. 
  There is too much use of the term project,@aethod, which should 
be standardized or it will fall into the disrepute that the term 
eulture has. We use the term to mean a highly concrete prob- 
lematie activity involving the use of conerete material. A 
project is a problematic act carried to completion in its natural 
setting and involving the utilization and manipulation of concrete 
materials. 
The project makes for economy of learning in that it gives 
clearness and focus to the material. It not only is interesting 
to the learner but interests him in the things he should be inter- 
ested in. It is a rigorous test. 
Exercises which are entitled to use the term project are: (1) 
the project that duplicates some life activity and tends to develop 
efficiency in that activity; (2) one that interprets some life 
activity but does not pretend to develop efficiency in the activity 
(soap-making, building model of a conerete bridge, ete.) ; (3) one 
that throws light upon a principle that would otherwise be 
abstract; (4) the test project. 
We should beware of so-called projects which waste time and 
do not further learning. Much of the make-believe stuff in 
kindergarten, making paper wagons, mudpies, ete., does not 
approximate real things, does not use real material, the pupils 
learn nothing of value. Generally speaking, you should use the 
materials and methods, at least essentially, that are used outside 
school. 
Horn proposes the following criteria for judging projects, 
which will be merely listed here because space prohibits 
reproduction of his excellent discussion. They are taken 
from an unpublished manuscript. 
(1) The project must represent a body of subject matter of 
known value in life outside the school; (2) the purpose of the 
school is not to interest the child merely, but to develop the 
interests which he should have; (3) the technics of teaching are

    special rather than general; (4) there must be a sharp and sys- 
tematic attack upon social objectives of value; (5) there must be 
special provision for thorough learning through practices, drills, 
summaries, reviews. 
Probably one of the best organized discussions is to be 
found in an article by Hosie in the English Journal for 
November, 1918.* #, .

AN OUTLINE OF THE PRoBLEM-PRogEcT METHOD 
I, Why discuss educational method? 
A. School studies tend to become exceedingly formal; their 
social origins and uses are too often lost sight of. 
B. Hence they fail to provide pupils with real and fruitful 
experiences leading to actual control of social values— 
they cease to be the best possible means of growth. 
C. The effectiveness of any course of study—what it becomes 
in actual practice—depends upon the methods of the 
\ teachers who attempt to carry it out. 
\ D. There is always possibility of improvement in education 
—especially now when a new and scientific educational 
psychology is becoming available. 
II. What the problem-project method is. 
A. Organization of school life in accordance with life in the 
home and in the community. A “project” may be 
defined as a single complete unit of purposeful experi- 
ence. 
B. Not to be exactly identified with any other current con- 
ception in education, such as interest, motivation, self- 
activity, socialized recitation, correlation, recapitula- 
tion, naturalism, developmental method, incidental 
teaching, informal teaching, self-government, logical 
thought movement, type studies, inductive science, 
laboratory method, shop practice, ete., though indebted 
more or less to all of these. 
C. A principle, not a rule, formula, fad, or panacea. 
D. Not to be thought of as embracing every aspect of learn- 
ing or every type of useful experience.

KE. A natural method of learning, that is of growing, which 
teachers may stimulate, guide, and render more effect- 
ive. In essence this method is that of full participation 
im typical experiences generally involving group activity 
or group relations. 
Why the name? 
A. “Method of experience” is too broad and too vague. 
B. “Problem” suggests«a purely intelleetual process. 
C. “Project” is ordinarily associated in educational diseus- 
sion with shop-practice. 
D. “Problem-project” emphasizes both thinking and doing 
and points to an objective result. 
- Nature and value of the project in education. 
A. A project is a complete “life-unit.” Its elements are as 
follows: 
. Situation. 
. Consciousness of a problem. 
Purpose to solve the problem (end in view). 
Plan conceived. 
. Criticism of the plan. 
. Execution of the plan. 
. Organization and use of results. 
. Judgment and appreciation of results (values). Note 
how the consciousness of an end controls activity. 
B. It enables the learner to make progress in gaining for 
control of experience those parts of the social in- 
heritance (solutions of life problems) which the school 
is commissioned to hand on. i 
C. It gives due emphasis to attitudes (interests and ideals) 
both as necessary for the acquiring of skills and knowl- 
edges and as of prime importance among the results 
aimed at. 
D. In other words, it provides the best conditions for learn- 
ing, namely, a definite end, vigorous exercise, sufficient 
duration, trying on of solutions, use of previous experi- 
ence, satisfaction in achievement, and occasion for 
thinking and organization of knowledge and skill. 
E. It is economical in that it provides for a wealth of related 
and concomitant ideas centering about the core of ex- 
perience which constitutes the given “lesson”; also in 
that it concentrates attention upon the larger things 
and tends to eliminate much useless formal detail.

. A different tradition prevails. 
. More knowledge of learning processes, more technical 
skill, and more scholarship are required than for 
the use of “logical” or “formal? methods—the 
teacher must play various réles. 
. It is difficult to organize a system of projects so as to 
provide for the entire body of attitudes, skills, and 
knowledges which at present we wish children to 
gain in school. 
Time is easily wasted by over-emphasis on some phase 
of the process—even on “teaching children to think.” 
The ordinary course of study must be largely reorgan- 
ized and rewritten. 
School equipment must be adapted. 
New measures of results must be applied. 
B. But the method employed by the nation is the method to 
be used in the schools. 
An unusually valuable discussion of the project, which 
appeared too late to be outlined here, will be found in

  THE PROJECT METHOD 221 
Parker’s articles, ‘‘Project Teaching: Pupils Planning 
Practical Activities,’? January and February, 1922, issues 
of the Elementary School Journal. With his customary 
expertness Parker has supplied a great amount of historical 
information, discussed the actual use of the project, and 
illustrated his viewpoint with detailed examples, all in brief 
space. The limitations of the project method are indicated 
and the point made that it is not the universal method, 
either in school or in real life. There is much valuable 
activity and learning in school and life that does not con- 
sist of planning and executing practical projects. Further- 
more, attention is called to that fact that although enthu- 
siasm for the project as a socialized form of learning is 
sweeping the country, on the other hand there has never 
been so much insistence and experimental work upon 
diagnosis of individual pupil difficulty and prescription of 
exercises fitted to the peculiar needs of the individual. The 
technique of project teaching involves on the part of the 
teacher wide knowledge, executive ability, and skill in 
directing problem solving. In his emphasis on problem- 
solving thinking as a big element in project teaching, Parker 
is in accord with many of the more practical writers on this 
topic. 
Relation of the Project to the Older Types of Teaching. 
—Hosic’s outline is given in full because it will be of great 
value to supervisors in answering the numerous questions 
teachers will ask concerning this method. Furthermore, it 
makes clear the relation to other types of teaching better 
than most other discussions. Practically all other discus- 
sions, however, do refer to this interrelation and many of 
the typical projects outlined are not different from illus- 
trations of problem-solving exercises given by Parker 
and other writers. MceMurry’s discussions of procedure in 
grade-school subjects as outlined in Elementary School 
Standards use the old terminology since the newer term was
-P-A-G-E-242
  222 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
not then in use, but they would be regarded now by many 
writers as discussions of projects. | 
Despite the wide range of statements many writers are 
attempting to come to an agreement in regard to the 
project. A few, of course, are more interested in exploit- 
ing pet ideas than in standardizing the definition. A 
review of the efforts of the different writers seems to 
indicate that they agree that a project may be either a 
group affair or an individual undertaking. Preferably 
the latter should have group relationships. In either event 
it is a unit of work extending over some time and en- 
gaging the enthusiastic efforts of those concerned. Both 
the project and the method of procedure are evolved by 
those directly interested. It differs from the old concep- 
tion of a lesson in that it covers more time and in- 
volves more material. It differs from a series of lessons 
Gin that it is one coherent, interwoven whole. Most writers 
urge that real materials be used and socially useful results 
be obtained. 
This seems to involve no new principle of learning but 
it does involve a marked and important redistribution of 
emphasis. By organizing work into larger units, prefer- 
ably involving group activity, learning more nearly 
approximates the conditions of real life. In the world 
people pursue their purposes over the course of weeks, 
months, or years. All the principles of reflective thought, 
of motor learning, all the implications of natural interests 
and of individual differences, ete., are manifest in the 
everyday activity of people. Life is a process of learning 
through the carrying out of the purposes and projects of 
the individual. By organizing school learning into 
projects the teacher is forced away from emphasis on some 
particular lesson type or principle of learning and is en- 
abled to view large units of activity that will involve sev- 
eral or ali the principles of learning, each in its proper 
aa

relation to the whole, each with the amount of time and 
' emphasis that it actually deserves. The very essence of 
the project method seems to be, not that it brings to light 
a new and unusual principle of learning, but that it pro- 
vides more easily and efficiently for the proper functioning 
of those we already know about. 
In organizing her work into projects the teacher must* 
have a broad view of the course of study and must realize 
the intimate relationships that so-called subject matter has 
with life. Not only must the professional training of the 
teacher be better, but also her general education must be 
broad and diversified. Given the view of subject matter 
and life that is necessary, the teacher must look around 
for points of contact between the pupils’ lives and ex- 
periences and the body of material that they must acquire 
| during the course of their schooldays. She should also be 
on the alert for projects that pupils will themselves 
initiate, since these will be the most efficacious. However, 
it is legitimate to so manipulate the situation that the 
learners will appropriate and make their own, projects 
which they probably would never have discovered. The 
same point is involved here as in the matter of smaller 
problems, namely, that while it is best to work upon prob- 
Jems or projects discovered by the learner, nevertheless 
efficient work and worth-while learning will take place 
during the execution of problems and projects introduced 
by the teacher. 
Once the problem is realized, the teacher and class 
should work out a method of attack, which will probably 
involve dividing the big undertaking into a number of 
smaller units for smaller groups or for individuals. Here 
will be involved in greater or less degree the principles of 
reflective thought, of assignment and study, sometimes of 
drill. Carrying the plan over into action will involve fur- 
ther these principles, plus those of motor skill, interest, 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  224 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING | | 
individual differences, self-activity, ete. As has" een 
stated, all these principles will enter into the learning 
process in their proper places and as contributions to the 
big movement. In the analysis of the problem, in the 
presenting of evidence, and in the summarizing there will 
be much opportunity for the socialized or contribution 
recitation, training in expression, ete. Many of the les- 
sons in the course of the project will partake of the nature 
of the well known type lesson. 
The working out and putting on of a dramatization, 
involving oral and written expression, study and reading, 
costume making, stage setting, etc., is a good project. 
The study of a city, of an industry, of a great man, of an 
era in history, of a region, are other examples. Debates 
and lessons on civic and political questions, gathering and 
writing local history, a consistent programme for beauti- 
fying the school grounds, will all furnish upper-grade 
projects involving reflective thought and motor skill. 
Agriculture and manual arts, domestic science and art 
are prolific sources of projects. In the lower grades the 
making of a city model, the study of an industry, of a 
strange people, of a historical personage or event, the 
preparation of a special programme, all afford oppor- 
tunities for this type of organization. 
Both teacher and supervisor are referred especially to the 
Nineteenth and Twentieth Yearbooks, Part I in each ease, 
of the National Society for the Study of Education; to 
McMurry’s Teaching by Projects; Branom’s The Project 
Method; Freeland’s Modern Elementary School Practice; 
The Baltimore County Course of Study; The Speyer School 
Curriculum ; Bonser’s The Elementary School Curriculum. 
Many other excellent discussions are in print but the fore- 
going will give much assistance in that they contain dis- 
cussions of actual projects or of material that can be easily 
made over into projects. 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE PROJECT METHOD 225 
The Project as a Method of Teaching and as a Type of 
Organization for Subject Matter.—It will be noted that 
in many of the discussions of this topic the word ‘‘project’” 
is used, by the different writers, sometimes as if it desig- 
nated a method of procedure, sometimes an organization 
of subject matter. ‘‘Projects’’ are organizations of sub- 
ject matter of a certain type. The ‘‘project method’’ in- 
volves the use of these organizations in teaching. 
A project when organized will involve parts of manyj 
subjects; the use of projects will call for the application 
of many principles of learning. Projects will use arith- 
metic, expression, history, drawing, handwork, etc., as 
each is necessary in the completion of the purpose. The 
whole is woven into a coherent unit of work, organized 
around a purpose or problem as a core, and inviting the 
enthusiastic participation of the learners. Such an organi- 
zation bears a slight and superficial resemblance to the 
early Herbartian schemes known as ‘‘concentration’’ or 
“correlation of the studies,’’ but differs most vitally in 
that the project is organized in terms of pupil-purpose 
and actual-life situations. The earlier schemes were 
purely in terms of subject matter. The project is usually 
shorter; it should not become fixed and formal but remain 
a living progressive thing, organized anew and differently 
by each group of pupils and in terms of each situation. 
The artificial separation between subjects as now organ- 
ized is broken down, and this is thought by some to be 
one of the most important contributions. The separation 
between subject matter and method is also in some meas- 
ure broken down. 
The project method, on the other hand, involves, as has 
been emphasized above, all or many of the known prin- 
ciples of learning, each in its proper place, each making 
its contribution to the complete unit of activity. Hach 
day’s work, the different units of accomplishment in the
-P-A-G-E-246
      226 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
course of the project, will utilize learning by mney 
thought, by imitation, and by drill as these processes are 
necessary. There will be assignments, supervised-study 
periods, socialized recitations, and other lesson types, as 
well as attention to individual interests, differences in 
capacity, and other principles of learning. 
The tendency seems to be to reserve the term ‘‘project’’ 
for the unit of subject-matter organization, and to sub- 
stitute for ‘‘project method’’ such terms as ‘‘teaching by 
projects,’’ ‘‘the use of projects in teaching,’’ ‘‘teaching 
through projects,’’ ete. 
Limitations of the Project Method.—Many enthusiasts at 
first claimed that full utilization of project teaching would 
do away with most of the other lesson types and teaching 
methods. It is now realized that even under ideal con- 
ditions there will still be drill lessons on essential skills 
and associations, even though much drill can be cared for 
in the project. There will be other isolated lessons and 
shorter organizations of subject matter for various rea- 
sons. The project method, however, in the hands of com- 
petent and highly trained teachers should undoubtedly 
take over a large amount of the time now devoted to 
shorter and more or less isolated lessons. 
Many practical difficulties stand in the way. Courses 
of study will have to be rewritten, administrative ma- 
chinery will have to be reorganized, and systems of 
thought possessed by some administrators will have to be 
remodeled by study and experimentation. There are also 
at the present limitations in teacher training and in 
materials and supplies available that will make this 
method impracticable in some situations. Experimenta- 
tion is going on and much will be learned from this. But 
in many schools organization of the subject matter into 
projects should proceed rapidly, and a competent super- 
visor must be familiar with the details of such organiza- 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
    THE PROJECT METHOD 227 
tion. A caution should be sounded here against organizing 
eut-and-dried projects and project curricula. Care must 
be taken that the project does not degenerate into the thing 
it is to cure, a fixed and formal statement of subject matter. 
SuMMaRY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
Many supervisors and experienced teachers will have 
already recognized the fact that they have been doing 
project teaching for some time without knowing it. A 
good deal of the difficulty that teachers have had with this 
method has been due to the fact that the early discussions 
of it were concerned chiefly with the psychological and 
‘philosophical bases, with theoretical disputes, and not 
primarily with the organization and administration of 
actual projects in the classroom. There was at first little 
attention to translating the terms used in the project dis- 
cussion into terms used and understood by teachers. 
The first service of the supervisor will then be to assist 
those experienced teachers to make better the skill they 
already have in the use of the method. With beginning 
teachers his work will be first to assist them in perfecting the 
technique of the simpler lesson types, gradually working 
over into larger and larger organizations until the project 
is understood. It is an actual fact that for many young 
teachers the project has been somewhat of a mystery, a 
unique and peculiar mode of procedure which only experts 
could expect to understand and use. It is true, of course, 
that teachers should be fairly expert before attempting 
its use, but simple projects can be handled by any average 
teacher. Simply to know that the project is not a mys- 
terious, highly technical affair is of considerable help to 
beginning teachers. 
In addition to working with teachers’ projects at first 
hand, the supervisor should refer his people to the several 
excellent discussions and illustrations included in the bib- 
liography.

    In judging a project the supervisor should note the t 
following points: | 
1. Is the project worth while? Does it really approximate life 
as far as school conditions permit? 
2. Is the teacher’s plan well organized and coherent? Does she 
avoid far-fetched connections? 
3. Is each day’s work definitely related to what has been done 
and to what is to come? Can the pupils connect the work 
themselves? Introduce and utilize the contributions of 
committees and individuals? 
4. Is it pupil-initiated? That is, do pupils suggest under- 
takings involving group activity and having desirable social 
results? 
5, If introduced by the teacher, do the pupils seize upon it 
enthusiastically and make it their own? 
6. Does the teacher avoid emphasis on some one phase, either 
learning process or some pet subject matter? 
7. Do the pupils participate in planning the attack? In break- 
ing up the big problem into units for committee and 
individual work? | 
8. Does the teacher guide and stimulate the class to make sug- 
gestions, to ask questions, to be self-active in searching © 
for and evaluating data, to acquire any necessary associa- 
tions and skills, ete.? 
The last question refers briefly to the general and 
special principles of learning that have been elaborated 
in the preceding chapters. It is to be reémphasized here 
that the project provides the best opportunity for the 
functioning of these various principles in relation to each 
other and to real situations. The supervisor must be on 
the alert during the entire project to note skillful or poor 
applications of them. Not only do the principles of learn- 
ing apply but also the principles involved in selecting sub- 
ject matter, which are set forth in Chapter XIL

   CHAPTER XI 
VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 
In the foregoing chapters there has been advanced a 
theory of method which holds that there are, in the main, 
three teaching lessons, namely, the lesson that results in 
an abstract meaning or generalization, the lesson that 
deals with the solution of problems, and the lesson that 
deals with the acquisition of arbitrary associations or of 
motor skills. The first two involve reflective thought, the 
third, imitation. 
These lessons are supplemented by the drill process 
where necessary. The assignment of lessons, the study 
process, and the project method were treated separately 
for the sake of emphasis and their relationship to the three 
fundamental principles of method pointed out. 
However, as pointed out in several places in the fore- 
going chapters, no lesson will follow rigidly and arbitrarily 
aset formula. There are an infinite number of variations 
possible. The genius of each teacher and the particular 
combination of circumstances in each teaching situation 
will determine the particular adaptation of method prin- 
ciples that is necessary. These facts have been the source 
of many so-called ‘‘methods of teaching’’ which are dis- 
eussed and used by teachers and supervisors as new 
departures. Since many of them are prominent in the 
thought and practice of teachers, they will be discussed 
briefly in this chapter. 
It seems that most of them will reduce to phases of the 
foregoing big principles of method. They will be found 
231 
   
-P-A-G-E-252
  232 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING } 
to be parts of the larger teaching movements which ave 
been isolated for emphasis, or they will be new devices for 
the application of these principles. This does not mean 
that they are not legitimate and worthy teaching pro- 
cedures. It is not necessary, either, for teacher or super- 
visor to agree to this reduction of all method to three big 
principles. This attempt at such classification is made in 
an endeavor to reduce the many and varied terminologies 
to a more compact system, making for ease of discussion 
and clarity of criticism. Those teachers who find it easier 
to think of the ‘‘type method’’ and of the ‘‘socialized 
recitation’’ as new, separate, and distinct lesson types, 
rather than as phases of the lessons involving reflective 
thinking, will continue to do so. The points of excellence 
in technique and the errors to be avoided will remain the 
same in either case. On the other hand, some teachers 
and supervisors will doubtless be saved much confusion 
and doubt by the classification here suggested. 
The danger in thinking of these so-called new methods 
of teaching as separate and distinct is that the teacher 
may become submerged in a number of isolated and 
formalized types of teaching and lose sight of the big, 
underlying psychological principles of learning. 
The Recitation.—The term ‘‘recitation’’ was until re- 
cently the most common one in the teacher’s vocabulary. 
It meant any and all class exercises. If we break the word 
up into its parts, ‘‘re-citation,’’? we find that it was not 
an ill-chosen term as schools were commonly conducted. 
Class periods were usually given over to the re-citing of 
material which had been memorized and carried over bodily 
from its original citation. Occasionally such an exercise 
is necessary and legitimate. Classes must sometimes be 
held for accurate knowledge of dogmatic facts which are 
memorized more or less exactly and given in answer to 
direct questions. Such exercises justify themselves only
-P-A-G-E-253
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 233 
by contributing to a reflective-thought process in some 
way. Drill lessons also often involve such a procedure. 
However, the activities of the recitation or daily class 
period are now widely different from what they were 
some years ago. The class period has now come to be 
regarded as one of training and learning through active 
participation by the pupil. It is no longer a period of 
marking time between study periods but a period where 
thought is carried forward and new work taken up. 
Newer methods of administering the class period have 
given rise to such terms as the contribution recitation, the 
socialized recitation, or the how-to-study lesson. 
The Contribution Recitation —In outlining the best pro- 
cedure for the assignment of lessons it will be recalled that 
emphasis was placed upon the practice of assigning differ- 
ent phases of a topic to individuals or groups for investi- 
gation and report. Training in the discovery, organiza- 
tion, and evaluation of data is secured, together with prac- 
tice in the drawing and verifying of inferences. In 
reporting the pupil must organize his material so that it 
will be of interest to his audience. He will receive train- 
ing in clear expression and in self-confidence. During the 
reports questions should be asked, and afterwards there 
should be a free give-and-take discussion. Such a discus- 
sion, stimulated and guided by the teacher, is a widely 
different procedure from the old-time recitation of isolated 
facts. In the hands of a skilled teacher it is one of the 
most efficient teaching devices, though it is often difficult 
for the beginner. Its merit is, obviously, in the stimula- 
tion to the thinking processes, interest, and initiative of 
the pupils. It is a sad commentary on teaching that it 
takes some little time to make children understand that 
they may express opinions, argue and debate, question, 
and ask for further information. The very highest type 
of training is being given when pupils are stimulated to
-P-A-G-E-254
       
234. SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
participate and advance opinions, are held for evidence 
and proof, when they become interested enough in their 
own arguments to hunt up further evidence and organize 
it for presentation, when there is the free interchange of 
ideas. 
Often such a lesson is not based upon assigned topics 
but may come at the very outset when a new topic is being 
taken up. The class can be stimulated to discuss ways 
and means of attacking the new problem, even reasons for 
attacking it at all. Many of them will have experiences 
from real life to contribute. In either type of lesson, then, 
the pupils are contributing what they know or have 
looked up, and it is from this that the lesson gets its name, 
“contribution recitation.’’ 
Because of the fact that every child takes part as he 
ean, or is given the opportunity to, because there is par- 
ticipation by all on equal footing, the same lesson type has 
also been called by many people the ‘‘socialized recita- 
tion.’’ Still other people saw in such lessons a golden 
opportunity to teach children the factors of study and so 
have dubbed them ‘‘how-to-study lessons.’’? All of these 
terminologies apply equally well to the technique involved 
and it matters not which is used. The new name does not 
designate a new and different type of teaching; it merely 
places emphasis on an excellent device for the better 
application of an old principle. Contribution or socialized 
recitations are usually parts of the presentation or inspec. 
tion steps of lessons involving reflective thought, though 
they may also occur during the preparation step. Occa- 
sionally they may precede the learning of a motor skill. 
As stated above, the new terms may be used if they make 
understanding any easier, but the technique of the lesson 
is the same as that discussed in Chapter V. There is 
added emphasis on stimulating the pupils to contribute 
and exercise initiative and self-activity. There is also a 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  VARIATION OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 235 
caution to be noted—that such lessons must not be allowed 
to wander aimlessly during the discussion. 
Some enthusiasts have insisted that the only type of 
recitation entitled to the designation ‘‘socialized recita- 
tion’’ is that in which the teacher turns the period over to 
the class or to a committee and withdraws from active 
participation. While such a procedure is highly desirable 
and is probably one of the outcomes of socialized recita- 
tions, it is not correct to limit such recitations to this one 
type. The essential or fundamental thing is not that the 
teacher’s efforts are reduced, though that is desirable, but 
that the class be stimulated to the freest discussion, to 
give-and-take argument, to search for and evaluate data— 
in short to group activity and codperative effort. This pro- 
cedure can be applied to construction projects as well as 
to the solution of thought problems. In both cases differ- 
ing degrees of teacher guidance may be necessary. 
The Developmental Method.—A term much older than 
those just discussed and having in part the same meaning 
is the developmental method. It is used to designate that 
type of lesson procedure in which the teacher develops the 
topic or subject by means of questions. It was first applied 
to the lesson in which the pupil contributed from his past 
experience and organized this experience into new general- 
izations or solved new problems. However, the term has 
been used very carelessly, being applied not only to lessons 
in which the pupil reported material recently studied but 
also to lessons in which the teacher developed the topic by 
lecturing. Because of this confusion, Parker suggests * the 
use of the term ‘‘conversational method.’’ This designation 
shows more clearly the relationship to the contribution or 
socialized recitation. The developmental or conversational 
method is not a separate and distinct lesson type but a

-P-A-G-E-256
  236 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
teaching device in the hands of the teacher to be used where 
applicable in the course of lessons involving reflective 
thought. It is a device for stimulating thought, and its 
application involves the technique of skillful questioning 
as set forth in Chapter IV and also the principles in 
Chapter V. 
The Socializing Lesson.—A few writers discuss a lesson 
designated as the socializing exercise, and it is often con- 
fused by teachers with the socialized exercise. Miss Earhart 
defines such a lesson as: ? 
Any exercise which tends to further social activity or social 
outlook, which gives insight into social conditions and usages, or 
which influences the attitude toward society, may be regarded as 
a socializing exercise. 
It is at once apparent that a socializing exercise may be a 
part of any one of a number of school activities. It is also 
evident that it may at times be incidental to them, or that it may 
be their main purpose. 
As Miss Earhart points out, the socializing element in the 
lesson does not determine or make a new lesson type. 
Emphasis on the social usages, the social importance of the 
material studied, emphasis on the intimate and intricate 
organization of the social whole bring about, the socializ- 
ing result, but the movement of thought involved will 
probably be one of those discussed in Chapter V. Some- 
times when appreciation of a skilled trade or difficult 
mechanical process is being taught, there might be some 
attempt to obtain the appreciation through attempts to 
accomplish the process, and in that case the lesson might 
involve the principles in Chapter VI. 
The Expression Lesson.—The amount of discussion and. 
the number of reports involved in a contribution or social- 
ized recitation focuses attention upon training in oral 
  
?L. B. Earhart, Types of Teaching, Boston, 1915, p. 131.
-P-A-G-E-257
VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 237 
  expression. A number of writers discuss the ‘‘expression: 
lesson.’? Probably the best treatment will be found ix 
Parker,’ who sets forth the essentials in training expres- 
sion as: (1) making sure the pupil has vital content to 
express, (2) providing motive by means of an audience 
situation, and (3) thorough preparation involving organ- 
ization of the material into a brief. The first two points 
\involve the securing of interest by means of an appeal to 
individual interests or by means of an emphasis on the 
intrinsic worth of the material studied, as discussed in. 
Chapter IV. There should be an aim that challenges the 
interest of both speaker and class and sends the former on 
a search for material. The third point involves the prin- 
ciples discussed in Chapters V and IX. The principles 
underlying drill, Chapter VII, will also be found appli- 
cable from time to time. Parker himself points out that 
training in expression is best obtained by means of con- 
tribution lessons in the content subjects. Project teaching 
also presents an excellent opportunity. 
Written composition will not only involve the principles 
of reflective thought in the securing of content, but on the 
form side will necessitate the application of the principles 
discussed in Chapter VI regarding the imitation of correct 
models. It should be noted here that the form side 
of written expression must not be emphasized to the point 
where it interferes with the flow of thought or kills 
interest. 
Expressive reading, whether from the book or the giv- 
ing of a memorized selection, also involves the imitation 
of correct models and drill. Enthusiasts will perhaps 
object vigorously to the statement that imitation of a 
model or plebeian drill is involved in their hobbies, but 
their attitude is based on a sentiment and a lack of

-P-A-G-E-258
238 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
analysis. In the end the expressive reader attempts to 
utilize certain more or less fixed emotional devices, to imi- 
tate a model. The very fact that expressive reading can 
be made to affect most people in the same way indicates | 
that there is a method fairly fixed and universal which can 
be attained by practice. This does not mean that there, 
should be no individual interpretation or variation. This) 
ean be provided for in having the pupil participate in set- 
ting the model and in many other minor ways. 
Expression in drawing, painting, modeling, etc., in- 
volves the same principles that the other forms of expres- 
sion involve. 
The Object Lesson.—The history of pedagogy shows the 
object lesson to have had a spectacular and somewhat 
checkered career Skipping detail, it may be stated that 
the object lesson originated with the worthy aim of 
relating school processes more closely to real things. It 
degenerated in many instances into so-called training of 
the senses and memory. The study of objects or activities 
in their proper relations and as parts of a larger thought 
process has been too often lost sight of. We may again 
quote a concise summary from Miss Earhart: * 
Since the objects studied must be related to knowledge already 
possessed in order to be understood and since the ideas gained 
are derived from the analytic study of the material itself, the 
object lesson involves the first two steps of the inductive lesson— 
the steps of preparation and presentation. Frequently the knowl- 
edge gained from the study of the concrete material and processes 
is used as a basis for comparison, generalization, and application, 
and in that case all of the formal steps are employed. Many 
times a single form—as a stream, a mountain, a plant, or an 
animal—is studied thoroughly, and is then made to serve as a 
type for similar objects, thus furnishing the core for later com- 
parisons and generalizations. The teacher may never attempt to 
base a general conclusion upon the object studied, but, through 
  
*Op. cit., p. 71. 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 239 
the natural tendency to reason from the concrete to the abstract, 
the pupils in the course of time may of themselves use the results 
of the object lessons to derive classifications, explanations, or 
laws. 
In addition to forming part of the process of making 
generalizations, as pointed out by Miss Earhart, an object 
lesson might also occur during the inspection step of a 
problem-solving exercise. When the study of an activity 
or process involves the doing of it, the principles appli- 
rable to learning a motor skill should be used. Teachers 
re referred to Miss Harhart’s chapter, which is very sug- 
gestive. Object lessons will add interest to history and 
geography and be useful in nature study, hygiene, and 
sanitation. 
The Type Method.—As psychologists point out, the 
mind naturally generalizes almost at once. Logically we 
should suspend judgment or generalization until sufficient 
examination has been made of several illustrations, but 
psychologically we do not do so. Crude generalizations 
are formed quickly upon meeting the first example of a 
class, species, genus, ete. Such judgments are, of course, 
reformed by the intelligent person as additional data are 
gathered and analyzed. This natural tendency of the 
mind is used in the type method of teaching. The type 
lesson is, in reality, the so-called inductive lesson or lesson 
in which abstract meanings or general notions are ac- 
quired but in which only one example is given to the class 
during the presentation step. This example is chosen 
because it is a type and represents fairly and rather fully 
all that could be learned by studying other cases in the 
same class. Types of cities, modes of transportation, geo- 
graphical regions, governmental schemes, industrial man- 
agement, classes of flowers, species of animals, ete., all 
afford opportunity for the use of this method. Object 
tessons are often type lessons. The step of comparison is
-P-A-G-E-260
  240 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
| 
obviously absent and the step of generalization need not 
necessarily be present as such. A generalization will 
usually be formed without effort, though the teacher may 
call attention directly to the fact that the typical example 
studied truly represents all others in the class. 
The technique of the type method is the same as that 
used in the lessons involving reflective thinking. Care 
must be taken to see that the example selected for study 
is truly typical, and that the study of it is complete an: 
well organized. A type lesson may also be involved in th: 
inspection step of a problem-solving lesson. ~ } 
Obviously a great amount of time will be saved by usin; 
the type method, since much material in the content sub- 
jects, particularly history and geography, may be taught 
this way. In addition to the time saved a clearer idea is 
very probably carried away by the pupils because one 
example has been studied intensively, instead of several 
in a hurried and unorganized manner. The underlying 
principle involved in this last statement is used in the 
selection of subject matter, as will be shown in the follow- 
ing chapter. 
The Appreciation or Enjoyment Lesson.—Modern state- 
ments of the aim of education give attention to the matter 
of training the appreciation or stimulating enjoyment. 
The type of lesson aimed at fulfilling this part of the aim 
has come in for considerable discussion. It is most com- 
monly called the ‘‘appreciation lesson,’’ but Parker points 
out that the word appreciation has many and varied mean- 
ings, and that its use makes for confusion. He suggests 
the term ‘‘enjoyment lesson’’ as being less likely to be mis- 
interpreted and as more truly carrying the meaning 
desired. 
The enjoyment lesson probably comes nearer to in- 
volving a new and distinct type of procedure than any 
of the other lessons discussed in this chapter does. The
-P-A-G-E-261
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 241 
added element is indicated in the following statement 
, from Miss Harhart: * 
It may be urged that all these ends (appreciation and enjoy- 
ment) are accomplished by the lessons which impart information 
in regard to various lines of knowledge and endeavor; but knowl- 
edge does not always include the feeling of appreciation which 
affects ideals. There is a value in facts over and above their 
intellectual value as facts. There is the appeal to interest, to 
emotion, to a sense of appreciation of deeper or finer significances 
than appear at first sight. The lesson or part of the lesson which 
is devoted to influencing such interest or appreciation may be 
called an exercise in appreciation. 
Undoubtedly there is involved in enjoyment lessons an 
element not present, or at least not dominant, in other 
lesson types. However, it may not be a totally new prin- 
ciple so much as it is the application of an old one in a 
way not commonly recognized. The key to the matter is 
found in Miss Earhart’s reference to ‘‘the appeal to 
) emotion, to a sense of appreciation of finer and deeper 
\ significances than first appear.’’ Psychologically emotion 
accompanies cognitive processes, and though it is a sep- 
arate psychological process, it does not exist alone. It is 
not always present, of course, except possibly in the form 
of a mild affective reaction. The experiencing of emotion 
is a natural and instinctive reaction, and the aim of the 
enjoyment lesson is to stimulate the exercise of such emo- 
tions as are desirable and enjoyable. But since emotion 
always accompanies a cognitive process, it would seem that 
the principles of method involved in thinking lessons 
would necessarily enter in some degree. Furthermore, 
enjoyment accompanies many kinds of motor activity, 
there is enjoyment of sensory processes, and these would 
seem to involve the principles that function in the acqui- 
sition of a motor skill. So far, then, the problem is to 
  
* Ibid., p. 109.
-P-A-G-E-262
  242 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
select those subject matters, those activities and skills 
which will arouse an enjoyable emotional accompaniment. , 
Individuals will differ somewhat, of course, in regard to. 
the bases of such enjoyment and in the extent of it. In- 
terpreting the last two statements in the light of previous 
chapters we see an application of the principles underly- 
ing instinctive interest and individual differences. An- 
other summary from Miss Earhart will emphasize the fact 
that the principles of method discussed above are implicit 
in the enjoyment lesson: * 
A person’s ideas of taste and of worth are based upon his 
knowledge to a great extent. . . . They are also influenced greatly 
by his attempts to do the thing himself; hence the suggestion that 
pupils try to write stanzas to complete the poem, “The Old and the 
New.” In some of the class lessons the pupils, through their own 
activity, may grow in the sense of beauty and fitness. Exercises 
in color combinations for house furnishing, house decorating, for 
dressmaking, or for applied design may be given by means of 
paints, crayons, colored papers, dress materials, ribbons, samples { 
of upholstering fabrics, or wall paper samples. Sometimes good / 
’ prints can be obtained which show the interior of famous houses.. 
These afford an opportunity to study colors, designs, and arrange- 
ment of decorations and furniture. Pupils can then, with their 
own materials, arrange and mount what they consider good com- 
binations of color and can profitably study and criticize the 
efforts of their fellow pupils. In connection with these lessons, 
they should observe and criticize the decorations of their houses 
and of the neighborhood. Possibly a generation thus trained 
would abolish much of the ugliness which now offends the public 
eye, and would substitute a more beautiful environment for it. 
In music it is possible to train pupils to feel that a certain 
quality of voice is the best one to express a given sentiment, while 
another sentiment demands quite a different quality. The tone 
and rhythm required for a bright spring song can be contrasted 
with those suited to a song that is stately or solemn. Attention

| the sentiment expressed. The attempt to compose music suited 
' to the words helps the growth of appreciation in music, just as 
the attempt to write leads to better appreciation of literature. 
Thorndike makes an even more direct statement of the 
fact that the well known principles hold sway in the 
appreciation lesson as well as in other class exercises: * 
The general laws which control responses of thought and of 
action control also responses of feeling. The work of education 
is to preserve desirable instinctive emotional responses by giving 
them exercise and rewarding them with pleasure, to eliminate the 
unfit ones and to form habits of feeling the right feeling at the 
right time. The principles stated in the chapters on instinct, 
interest, apperception, and habit are then applicable to the 
emotions. 
But this does not settle the matter of the enjoyment 
lesson. The remaining element is the most important of 
all. The greatest emphasis must be placed on this fact, 
that no matter how skillfully a teacher may select subject 
matter or skills that appeal to the best esthetic and 
emotional standards, present them from the intellectual 
point of view, and appeal to the instinctive interests and 
individual differences of her class, she may still fail to 
stimulate enjoyment or to build up those permanent habits 
of enjoyment which are essential. There must be added to 
the teacher’s skill in classroom procedure an emphasis on 
attitude. In dealing with emotions she is working with 
intricate, complex, and delicate psychological processes. 
No technical discussion is necessary to show the impor- 
tance of the emotions, their erratic behavior in one in- 
stance, or their assistance to the individual in another. 
The slightest stimulus is enough to start an emotional 
reaction and an equally small hindrance will completely 
inhibit it. No teacher can stimulate appreciation or 
‘HE. L. Thorndike, Principles of Teaching, 1906, p. 198. 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  244 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
enjoyment of things she herself does not enjoy. A teacher | 
who lacks the flexible, playful, fun element in her make-up 
cannot successfully teach such lessons. The enjoyment 
must be real. No amount of pretending or of false en- 
thusiasm will deceive the pupils, except possibly a small 
minority. The saddest sight on a playground is the 
teacher of the ‘‘school-ma’am”’ type attempting to play 
with her pupils. Occasionally a rule is promulgated by a 
superintendent requiring the teachers to participate in 
’ the play activities of the school and to teach such games 
and sports as will develop habits of enjoyment. The 
results with a few teachers are pathetic. On the other 
hand, the teacher who will throw herself into games and 
sports can stimulate real enjoyment and incidentally teach 
much of fair play, sportsmanship, and the like, bringing 
about an appreciation of these qualities. 
In the schoolroom the teacher who is cold and harsh can 
never stimulate her class to an enjoyment of poetry or 
pictures that express tender emotion, kindness, and sym- 
pathy. Her class well knows that her life is so organ- 
ized that these emotions do not enter in to any extent. 
Neither false enthusiasm nor gushing will bring to her 
class a real and sincere enjoyment. In a popular novel 
there is a schoolroom scene in which an old-maid teacher 
of the story-book type is attempting to teach kindness, 
sympathy, and love by means of a poem about little birds 
in anest. When the line is read stating that ‘‘Little birds 
in their nests agree,’’ a little country girl speaks up from 
a wealth of experience and asserts, ‘‘But they don’t, they 
fight like everything.’”’ The teacher raps the child 
smartly across the knuckles with a ruler for making this 
accurate and correct contribution to the lesson and then 
wonders why the class does not appreciate the beauties of 
nature. 
In the past, too much emphasis on the intellectual side
-P-A-G-E-265
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 245 
f these lessons has killed the spirit they were attempting 
0 arouse. Too much analysis, too much attention to non- 
ssential detail, too much emphasis on rigid and dogmatic 
‘orm are fatal to the emotional glow of interest and 
njoyment. Such formalism is to be most scrupulously 
A problem the supervisor must be prepared for is the 
‘teacher who discusses appreciation in a very soulful but 
vague and incoherent way. This type of teacher has a 
great deal to say about appreciation, about inspiration, 
appeals to the soul of the child, and similar rubbish. Some 
of them get results with the children that are obvious and 
in those rare cases should be left alone to achieve these 
esults in the peculiar manner they have. The majority 
of such teachers, however, do not know what they are 
talking about and cannot make any specific, concrete, 
definite statements to show that they do. They are much 
hurt by requests to tell more exactly what they are appre- 
ciating, how the lesson begets appreciation, and how they 
know that the pupils are really being stimulated. While 
appreciation cannot be measured, as can arithmetic and 
spelling, nevertheless the supervisor need. not hesitate to 
ask these teachers to discuss the psychology of emotion 
in an intelligent way and to make clear and direct appli- 
eations to their work. If they cannot do so, they should 
be directed to use their time in other fields to better 
advantage. The enthusiast need not fear the death of 
appreciation or enjoyment because of this insistence that 
some educational result be demonstrated. Appreciation 
is a delicate thing, but well able to stand such demands. 
Evidences of appreciation are to be found when pupils 
hum or sing the tunes they have been given in class; 
when they note of their own accord a tasteful arrange- 
ment of color; when they begin to reject lithographs and 
cheap prints for better pictures; when they begin to dis-

eriminate between poor jokes and stories and good ones 
ete. { 
The illustrations in the foregoing have all been take 
from the field of esthetic appreciation or enjoyment. In} 
the field of social appreciations, where human motives and 
achievements are involved, the same principles will hold 
equally well. That is, in so far as emotional reactions are 
involved in the appreciation or enjoyment of nobility of 
character, of heroism in battle or in scientific experiment, 
of self-sacrifice, ete., they will be aroused and guided in 
much the same way as emotional reactions to other facts. 
It would seem then that the enjoyment lesson is one 
characterized by the spirit of fun or play, of enjoyment 
or appreciation it engenders. This result is achieved by! 
placing stress upon and making prominent those subjec 
matters and skills which have an instinctive emotional ap; 
peal. An essential in success is the teacher’s attitude. 
She must be able to participate in the enjoyment thor- 
oughly and sincerely. Hair-splitting analysis, discussion 
of form and technique, and overmuch memorization are to 
be avoided. 
The Review Lesson.—Time was when the last few weeks 
of a term or semester were dedicated to review. Fre- 
quently this review was in reality a drill process. The 
old material was passed. over again just before examina- 
tions in an effort to recall much that had faded and to 
stamp in those facts deemed essential by the teacher. The 
process was repetition. We now distinguish between a 
drill and a review in that a drill attempts to make fixed 
and automatic certain associations or skills, while a review 
is the re-viewing or re-teaching of old material for the 
purpose of gaining new associations or getting a new view. 
A review has some of the drill element in it, of course, 
because it aims to make more permanent in the learner’s 
mind certain logical associations and ideas. Its ‘aim is
-P-A-G-E-267
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 247 
etter accomplished, however, by means of a new teaching 
esson, rather than by repetition. Even the attentive 
epetition characteristic of good drill lessons is not an 
pconomical way of handling material fitted to the true 
eview lesson. In the main the drill lesson is used in the 
ormal subjects which are productive of those fixed associa- 
ions which have to be learned accurately and made auto- 
Imatic. ‘The review lesson functions better in the content 
subjetts where.learning is better served by increasing the 
number of logical associations than by rote memory. 
A well selected and skillfully taught review lesson is an 
index of teaching ability that the supervisor should not 
overlook. Teachers with a good view of the course of 
study and possessed of the ability to see relationships not 
immediately apparent can construct such lessons. The 
review of the old material is often introduced so skillfully 
and with such seeming inevitability that the class will 
work hard on material they already know from one angle, 
thus gaining in associations and power of recall. They 
will not feel that they are repeating work that has already 
been sucked dry of interest. The new project organiza- 
tion gives excellent opportunities for such review lessons. 
A teacher in the intermediate grades taught the William 
Tell stories under the aim, ‘‘Let us see how William Tell 
became the ‘Father of his country.’ ’’ Before the series of 
lessons was over, the class had recalled and discussed prac- 
tically all they knew of the life and activities of George 
Washington during the Revolution. 
Another class working out the aim, ‘‘Let us see why we 
should swat the fly,’’ reviewed and restated much that 
they had learned previously and under a different aim 
regarding germ carriers. An upper-grade class working 
on the aim, ‘‘Let us see why we have the Civil Service 
system,’’ obtained a very good review of the ‘‘Spoils 
System’’ which they had studied previously under Presi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-268

    dent Jackson’s administration. In lower-grade histor 
the study of any great leader can be made the excuse fo: 
reviewing those studied before: for instance, ‘‘Let us sed 
how Napoleon was like Alexander the Great.’? The intro, 
duction to the reading of The Man without a Country migh 
well be a review lesson involving the previous study, 0: 
Aaron Burr and Benedict Arnold. There is unlimite 
opportunity for the individuality of the teacher in planning 
these lessons. The technique involved is that,of the Tessons, 
involving reflective thought. 
Wherever any amount of old knowledge can be recalled 
and used in connection with new lessons, new associations 
are formed making recall easier and understanding more 
complete. Much incidental review is obtained in the prep- 
aration and presentation steps of some lessons. 
Tests and Examinations.—Since time immemorial ex- 
aminations have pestered pupil, parent, and pedagogue. 
Many have been the sins, both of omission and commission, 
attendant upon the giving of examinations. We may 
safely disregard the contentions of those who stand for 
no examinations and proceed to a discussion of the prin- 
ciples underlying these necessary school exercises. The 
first essential is to understand clearly what the examina- 
tion is to determine. Roughly, tests are to determine how 
much a pupil remembers, how much he understands, or 
how well he can apply what he remembers and under- 
stands. In some subjects we test mainly for one of these 
factors, in others two, and in still others all three. 
In the formal or tool subjects absolutely accurate mem- 
ory of associations and skills is aimed at, and there have 
been devised standard tests for measuring the pupil’s 
proficiency, known as educational measurements. They 
involve cards of drill problems, which have been discussed 
previously, together with tables of standard scores for 
age and grade. Testing is thus largely taken care of
-P-A-G-E-269
       
      
   
        
   
                                               VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 249 
utomatically in the field of testing memory of these asso- 
iations and skills. When pupils have attained the stand- 
rd score for their age and grade, they are judged pro- 
cient and excused from drill. After the standard score 
as been attained, occasional tests should be given to 
etérmine how well the ability is being retained. 
It is to be noted that these tests make prominent a very 
important factor, in testing which has largely been over- 
looked in tMe past, namely, the redirection of teaching 
emphasis. Examinations should not be regarded as 
hurdles to be successfully jumped but as teaching devices 
that indicate to both teacher and pupil the place of 
emphasis for further work. Ideally, examinations should 
| be teaching exercises instead of inquisitions; The stand- 
ard drill and test material being published to-day makes 
prominent this diagnostic element and teachers should 
utilize it. Further discussion of this point will be found 
in Chapter XIII. 
Understanding plays a small part in formal learning, 
but application is important and is not always guaranteed 
by correct memory of the isolated associations. Many of 
the standard tests combine memory and application, but 
when they do not, the teacher must devise clothed prob- 
lems for this purpose. If examinations are to be teaching 
devices and are to further the learning process, obviously 
the questions must emphasize the application of the asso 
ciation in the way it will be most commonly used in life. 
There is little excuse for peculiarly worded ‘‘catch’’ ques- 
tions; the language should be clear and exact. Some 
teachers believe that catch questions train pupils to think; 
so they will, but not in the way called for in real life. 
Questions should call for real application and intelligent 
discrimination by the pupil. Trick questions do not 
always secure this. 
In the content. subjects the testing of the understand-   
-P-A-G-E-270
SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
ing presents a difficult problem. (- In the past examination! 
have been mainly memory exercises and have not tested 
in any real way the student’s derstanding of th 
material or his ability to apply it. ) The construction o: 
questions that will do this requirestime, study, and th 
best efforts of the teacher. The supervisor should examin 
questions from time to time and discuss with the teacher: 
what is being tested, the make-up and aim of the ,ques- 
tions, ets. Ifa glittering generalization may*be permitted 
here: (Questions should not be directed straight at the 
information desired but at the solution of a situation that 
necessitates the application of this information. \ Students 
will often object to such questions, but they aré neverthe- 
less the best type of examination. A college class was | 
asked, ‘‘In the light of our criterion for scientific judg- 
ments, criticise the conclusion reached by the Chamber of 
Commerce in its recent controversy with the faculty,’’ 
and objected strenuously to the question. A majority of 
the class felt that if they answered a question calling 
merely for a restatement of the criterion, they would suf- 
ficiently demonstrate their understanding. To apply it to 
a real situation was no part of the game for them. An- 
other class was asked to apply to a problem five principles 
that had been discussed at length and likewise felt 
that a fair examination would be one that called for 
restatement of the principles. To be asked to recall and 
also think was too much. However, questions that assume 
material studied in class and that call for application to a 
new situation are to be sought and used by teachers. 
The matter of testing enjoyment or appreciation is as 
yet unsolved. There are, however, pupil activities that 
can be observed that will indicate that such lessons are 
having an effect even though the extent and nature of the 
effect cannot be measured. When students, as has been 
‘said, whistle or hum tunes they have had in class, when 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 251 
they manifest growing interest in better types of stories 
and pictures, when they attempt crudely to imitate some 
of the things given, results are being obtained. Further 
than this we cannot go at present. Too often enjoyment 
lessons have involved memory examinations on the con- 
tent material, on the lives of the authors or musicians 
studied, or on the bibliography and adventures of the 
poets. Such examinations, legitimate in other courses, 
are to be avoided in pure enjoyment work as they con- 
tribute nothing and detract much. 
A great deal has been said about the so-called surprise 
test. The argument that such a test reveals more truly the 
extent of the student’s knowledge is balanced by the one 
that the emotional stress handicaps many students so that : 
they are unable to demonstrate their best work. Since 
real understanding is the result aimed at, it would seem 
that tests should be announced in advance. The danger 
of cramming by the students can be avoided by the use of 
such questions as call for analysis and real understanding 
that cannot be gained in a brief preparation period. On 
the other hand, brief formal tests calling for often used, 
fundamental facts that are involved in all parts of the 
subject may be given without warning. ( Care should be 
taken to see that they call for those facts which are really 
fundamental and prominent enough so that all. students 
should be expected to know them at any time) Good 
forms for such tests are: sheets of sentences with words 
or phrases blank, known as completion tests; sets of state- 
ments to be marked true or false according as the student 
judges; words, names, dates, phrases may be called off and 
students given a minute after each to write down what 
comes in their minds. Many other quick memory tests 
may be devised. 
In either event, whether formal tests are announced in 
advance or short memory quizzes given without warning,
-P-A-G-E-272
  252 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
the teacher should avoid the extremes of too many or too 
few tests. Toe 
Story-Telling ; Picture Study; Memorization of Poetry; 
Dramatizations.—Efforts have been made by some teach- 
ers and normal schools to evolve separate methods of 
teaching for each of the above school exercises. However, 
each reduces very easily to one or other of the larger types 
of teaching or becomes part of a project. 
Story-telling for repetition involves a study of the 
thought under a problematic aim, followed by the teach- 
er’s telling of the selection. The child imitates the model 
as accurately as may be desired and gives such emphasis 
as his individual interests and make-up dictate. If 
repetition is not the aim, story-telling becomes an exercise 
in enjoyment. 
The presentation of pictures is usually preceded by a 
discussion of what the picture shows and the story it tells; 
then it may be discussed freely for pure enjoyment. The 
preceding analysis should be carefully administered to 
avoid technicalities. Information about the painter or the 
circumstances attending the making of the picture may be 
presented in an interesting way, but pupils should not be 
held so rigidly for this information that they dislike the 
study of pictures. If there are no interesting things about 
the picture or painter, his life would better be left out of 
the discussion. 
The memorization of poetry involves very clearly the 
imitation of a model and drill, following an analysis of the 
thought. 
Dramatization also involves imitation of a model, but 
every opportunity for the play of individual differences 
should be allowed. Interest and self-activity are obvi- 
ously prominent, though some dramatizations are so 
administered by the teacher that true self-activity does 
not take place. Many forms of manual skill will be
-P-A-G-E-273
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 253 
involved in making costumes and scenery. In working 
out lines and stage business the children should be allowed 
to organize and experiment, thus receiving excellent train- 
ing. Expression is a large factor. Dramatization is par- 
ticularly well fitted to form the basis of a project or to 
become a part of one. 
Summary For THE SUPERVISOR 
This chapter is itself in the nature of a summary, treat- 
ing briefly a number of the commonest variations of teach. 
ing procedure. An effort has been made to relate these 
various lesson types to the basic principles of method as 
set forth in Chapters V and VI. It is not necessary for 
teachers or supervisors to agree to the classification here 
given. It is made simply to enable us to organize teaching 
problems under fewer heads and to make for uniformity 
of discussion. Briefly, we may state that all the lessons 
discussed in this chapter are based in the main on prin- 
ciples underlying lessons involving reflective thought. In 
addition, however, the supervisor should give attention to 
the following special points, 
OBSERVATION OUTLINES FoR Various Lesson TYPES 
During a contribution or socialized recitation, or while 
the teacher is using the developmental method, the super- 
visor should give special attention to her skill in questioning 
and in stimulating self-activity (see previous outlines). 
‘When such lessons are emphasizing expression principally, 
the supervisor may have these questions in mind: 
1. Is a real audience situation provided? Is the material re- 
ported of real interest to the class? Of real use to them? 
2. Are the reports well organized? Does the teacher see out- 
lines of them beforehand in order to check useless errors 
and point out omissions? 
3. Is there free expression of opinion and discussion after- 
wards?
-P-A-G-E-274
  254 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
4, Is the day’s work summarized and related to what has pre- 
ceded; to what is to come? Is the lesson part of a project? 
If so, is it well placed? 
During an object lesson the supervisor may use the fol- 
lowing questions, in addition to those relating to the move- 
ment of thought: 
1. Is the subject matter worth teaching? Is it part of a pro- 
ject? If so, is it well placed? 
2. Are the objects, flowers, animals, specimens, etc., actually 
on hand for observation and discussion? A sufficient 
supply? 
3. Is there a real aim for the lesson? Does the teacher avoid 
aimless discussion or pointless listing of parts and activi- 
ties observed? 
4, Is the generalization involved hinted at or given directly 
toward the close of the lesson? 
It is to be remembered that the excursion lesson, men- 
tioned in Chapter V, is in reality an object lesson. The 
supervisor should observe or inquire into the following 
points: 
1. Is the place, activity, or organization, to be visited worth 
observing ? 
2. Will the excursion illustrate or contribute to a larger issue 
in the pupil’s regular work? If it is part of a project, 
is it well placed? 
3. Is there a careful preparation on the subject-matter side? 
(a) Do the pupils know what they are going to see, and why? 
(b) Are they prepared to understand it? 
(c) Is an aim set up? 
4, Is careful preparation made on the routine side? 
(a) Clear explanation of where to go, how to get there, how 
to conduct themselves while there, how to return? 
(bo) All signals worked out and explained for moving class - 
from place to place, gathering it together, ete.? 
(c) Has the teacher been over the ground beforehand and 
made sure of all arrangements? 
5. Are there individual and group assignments in addition to 
the big aim for all? Instructions as to note taking? 
6. Is there careful preparation for a summarizing lesson to be
-P-A-G-E-275
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 255 
held on return, or next day, involving reports and dis- 
cussion? 
The following questions will assist in observing a type 
lesson: 
1. Is the illustration really typical of the class being discussed? 
2. Is the lesson well organized? All legitimate details woven 
into the whole? Sub-aims set up to provide for such 
material as cannot be brought in smoothly? If part of a 
project, is it well placed? 
3. Is the generalization based upon the single illustration 
pointed out? Made by the class? Qualified if necessary? 
Story-telling and picture study cannot very well be sum- 
marized further than they have been in the preceding pages. 
Both involve reflective thought in analyzing and under- 
standing the thought, followed usually by an enjoyment 
Jesson. Too much analysis or technical discussion should 
be avoided. If repetition is to follow the telling of the 
story, imitation of a model is involved. Both types of les- 
son may be parts of projects. Dramatization involves in 
effective ways most of the general and special principles 
of learning and may also be a project or part of one. 
The appreciation or enjoyment lesson presents more ques- 
tions in addition to the basic principles than do some of the 
other lessons: 
1. Does the material being taught make a more or less universal 
appeal? Is it adapted to the enjoyment capacities of the 
class? Does the teacher note individual differences? (They 
are usually more marked in enjoyment lessons than in 
other types.) 
2. Is the lesson preceded when necessary by discussion of the 
thought? Are the pupils prepared to understand the 
thought of the artist or author? 
3. Does the teacher avoid technical analysis? Avoid emphasis 
on details not essential to enjoyment? 
4, Does she strive for a feeling response? Avoid, however, 
trying to force expression of it by questions such as, 
“Don’t you enjoy this?’’ or, ‘‘Is this not beautiful?’’
-P-A-G-E-276
  256 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Does she stimulate free spontaneous expression of enjoy- 
ment? Allow experimentation with process involved? 
5. Does she avoid vague, incoherent discussion and statements 
in regard to worth or beauty? 
6. Does she really enjoy it herself? Avoid hypocritical remarks 
in regard to desired effect on the pupils? 
7. Is the lesson well planned and administered? Definite and 
purposeful? 
8. Is there any attempt to use in real life the feelings aroused? 
Is the original material drawn in part from real life? 
Tests and examinations in the formal skills should be 
routinized. In the content subjects the questions should be 
earefully constructed in order to stimulate thinking. In 
both cases regular testing should be provided for. 
The review lesson is most effective when it is a teaching 
lesson involving both new and old material. New lessons 
should be selected that necessitate the use of old material 
from a new angle. 
Ozservation OuTLINES In Terms oF Pupiu Activity 
The pupil activity to be observed in an object lesson or 
in a type lesson is practically the same as that outlined for 
the first two steps in the lessons involving reflective think- 
ing. Sometimes the last two steps will be involved as well. 
In the case of the socialized or contribution recitation, the 
developmental method, or the expression lesson, the follow- 
ing points should be observed in addition to those regard- 
ing questioning and self-activity. 
1. Do the pupils seem sincerely interested in the reports or 
contributions being made? Indicate this by attitude, ques- 
tions, arguments, supplementary contributions? Do they 
take notes for future discussion? 
2. Do the pupils reporting speak from notes or not? Avoid 
undue dependence on notes? Is there evidence of planning 
and organization? ‘Avoidance of rambling? 
3. Do they manifest a growing ability to put emphasis and 
individuality into their talks, avoiding monotonous ‘‘speak- 
ing of a piece’’? Use their own words, avoiding undue 
dependence on language of the original source?
-P-A-G-E-277
  VARIATIONS OF METHOD PRINCIPLES 257 
4, Do the speakers talk to the whole class or to teacher only? 
5. Does the class question and discuss freely at the conclusion? 
6. Do pupils seem willing to make reports, volunteering to do 
so? Avoid refusal or coaxing? 
7. Can the class summarize coherently at the close of such an 
exercise? 
For the excursion lesson the following points should prove 
helpful: 
1. Do they contribute by questions and discussions to develop- 
ing the reason for making the excursion? 
2. Can they state clearly the reason for making the trip? State 
the details they will observe that are to contribute to 
elearer understanding of the problem under discussion? 
3. Do they actively search for details and ask questions? Avoid 
mere passive observation or amusement with obvious bu 
unimportant details? Does the occasion seem to be ony 
of business, or merely a holiday for the killing of time? 
4, Do they codperate while observing and combine efforts in 
the endeavor to get all the details and a clear understand- 
ing of them? Take notes? 
5. Avoid interference with any process being observed or an- 
noyance to workmen and operatives? 
6 Can they restate accurately the directions given them regard- 
ing conduct in going and coming? 
7. Can they summarize and tell intelligently what they have 
seen? Do better than mere description? Can they relate 
it to the rest of their work? 
Observation of appreciation lessons will be guided by the 
following questions: 
1. Do the expressions and attitudes of all, or a majority of, 
the pupils indicate real attention and enjoyment? Passive 
attention? Positive dislike? 
2. Do they ask such questions as seem to further the under- 
standing which is necessary to some types of appreciation? 
3. Is there free, spontaneous expression of enjoyment? Do 
they clap their hands? Ask for repetitions of old favorites 
among the stories, poems, songs, ete. ? 
4, Do they try to repeat or use the things they see and hear? 
Sing or hum to tunes? Play or dramatiz« stories?  
-P-A-G-E-278
258 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
5. Do they refrain from high-flown phrases in regard to worth 
and beauty and other terms which they obviously do not 
understand? 
6. Do they avoid those affected expressions of emotion which 
are obviously to please the teacher? Do they occasionally 
state honestly that they do not enjoy the presentation?

       CHAPTER XII 
THE SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 
The Nature of Subject Matter.—To many people subject 
matter means the material to be found in textbooks, peri- 
odicals, or other printed sources. Another group in 
violent reaction against what they call the formalism of 
books maintains that subject matter is best found any- 
where except in books. To them subject matter is life. 
The truth of the matter probably is that subject matter is 
much more than can be found in books and a good deal 
less than all of life. It is that part of life, that part of 
the social inheritance, those skills, knowledges, attitudes, 
and sentiments which will best fit the individual to enter 
that particular phase of life surrounding him. The ‘‘life 
surrounding him’’ must not be interpreted too narrowly. 
Subject matter is not a term limited to school curricula 
but involves the material acquired through life as long as 
education shall continue. 
The Development of Subject Matter.—A brief glance at 
the history of education will give a better understanding 
of this topic and emphasize the vital necessity of careful 
selection of subject matter. With the first men life was 
simple, and education was a process of actual participation 
in the life of the group.. All the ways of thinking, feeling, 
and acting—specifically, the activities involved in securing 
food, clothing, and shelter, in protecting the tribe, in 
trading and barter, etc., were passed on from generation 
to generation. Subject matter in those days was life. It 
261
-P-A-G-E-282
    262 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
was a closely interwoven whole and not a series of units as 
to-day. 
But as civilization progressed, life became more and 
more complex. There was more and more to be learned 
and transmitted. Not only did the simple, practical activi- 
ties of everyday life become more diverse and complex, 
but folklore, religion, a simple philosophy grew up. 
Knowledge of these was deemed essential for the safety 
of the individual and of the tribe. <A special set of men, 
the medicine men, were set apart and given the task of 
remembering and transmitting the social heritage. At 
stated times, usually at adolescence, the young men were 
gathered together and initiated into the mysteries of the 
tribe. The more practical phases of education continued 
to be learned by participation during childhood and youth. 
Another stage came when the mass of material became 
too unwieldy and cumbersome for memory and had to be 
written down in crude picture language on skins, leaves, 
parchments, ete. This was the beginning of the textbook. 
As soon as material is written down, it becomes, of neces- 
sity, somewhat fixed. It cannot keep pace with social 
changes or adapt quickly to new conditions. Civilization 
and life keep up their onward march, however, old con- 
ditions change, activities drop out, new ones come in. 
There was with every generation new relationships to be 
adjusted, new discoveries and inventions that vitally 
changed modes of living. But since written subject mat- 
ter could not keep pace with these changes, we have had, 
from ancient times to the present, upheavals in which 
school curricula have been violently attacked and rad- 
ically changed. Spencer’s famous essays may be men- 
tioned in passing, and many other discussions are available 
that will give the supervisor an insight into the extent 
to which school procedure and life can drift apart. There 
are to-day schools in this country using textbooks in the
-P-A-G-E-283
THE SELECTION OB SUBJECT MATTER 263 
social studies that were copyrighted before the teachers 
using them were born. Obviously they can contain 
nothing of recent history or development or of experi- 
mental results regarding learning. 
Standards by Which to Judge Subject Matter.—Bear- 
ing in mind, then, the facts that subject matter was origin- 
ally the actual processes of life, that it should still approx- 
imate life as closely as the school situation will permit, 
and being aware of the difficulty of keeping written sub- 
ject matter in step with progress in real life, we can see 
the vital necessity of being ever on the alert, of being ever 
critical of what is taught. There is need for constant 
examination of curricula, need for constant examination 
of life to see that the two approximate each other and are 
intimately interrelated. The supervisor must have def- 
inite standards based upon experimental evidence when 
possible and supplemented by expert theory where there 
is yet no evidence. By means of these he can judge and 
evaluate subject matter already included in the cur- 
riculum or subject matter that is suggested for inclusion. 
These standards should be evolved and applied through 
the efforts of three people, the expert in the subject itself, 
the supervisor, and the teacher. The supervisor must be 
reasonably familiar with the organization of the subject in 
terms of itself and familiar with the experiences of chil- 
dren, which must be the basis for the introduction of the 
material. The supervisor must thus be open to advice 
from both the expert in the subject and the teacher. 
McMurry’s Standards.—Several attempts have been 
made to set up criteria for subject matter. MeMurry pro- 
pounds four standards which will be found very valuable 
in viewing new subject matter or in critically evaluating 
old. He believes that all subject matter should (1) make 
provision for motive on the part of the children, (2) give 
opportunity for the display of initiative by both teacher
-P-A-G-E-284
264 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
and pupil, (3) be organized coherently, (4) take cog- 
nizance of the principle of relative values. 
He takes for granted that the subject matter must be 
intrinsically worth while and useful. Beyond that, any- 
thing taught must také account of children’s interests, 
likes and dislikes, past experiences, ete., so that it will 
make an appeal and stimulate active attack. Closely re- 
lated to this factor is the requirement that children and 
teachers must be allowed to react to this subject matter in 
terms of their individual capacities and purposes. Ma- 
terial ever so interesting as a field for individual experi- 
mentation and initiative becomes dead and lifeless when 
all must do the same things in the same way. Since 
organization of ideas into coherent systems usable in real 
situations is a desired end, the material must avoid, in the 
first place, stress on isolated facts or series of unrelated 
ideas; it must be woven into a related functioning whole. 
Lastly, some parts of a subject or even whole subjects, 
quite valuable in themselves, must be left out of the organ- 
ization or be given a minor place because other parts of 
the subject or other subjects are more valuable when 
viewed from the point of social usage. 
An excellent discussion of these standards and their 
application to the New York City curriculum will be found 
in MeMurry’s Elementary School Standards. The wealth 
ef specific illustration will be of valuable assistance to the 
supervisor. See especially pages 79-172. 
Parker’s Principles—An even better organization of 
criteria will be found in either of Parker’s two texts on 
general method. This author sets forth that subject mat- 
ter should be selected, (1) in relation to varying social 
needs, (2) in accord with the principle of relative values, 
(3) so that fewer topics are treated intensively instead of 
many extensively, (4) so that it is organized in terms of 
the learner rather than in terms of the subject itself,
-P-A-G-E-285
  THE SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 265 
The first principle is supplemented by the statements 
that social needs vary historically, between communities, 
and within the same community. That is, subject matter 
that was very valuable long ago, Latin for instance, is not 
necessarily of value to-day; material that would be val- 
uable in an agricultural course in eastern Oregon would 
not be so valuable in the heavily forested regions around 
Coos Bay in the western part; shop work that would be 
interesting and valuable in the industrial section of a 
large city would have small place in a school in the same 
city drawing its pupils from the business and professional 
lasses. 
In Parker’s discussion of high-school methods these four 
principles are treated together as underlying the selection 
and arrangement of subject matter. In his later treat- 
ment of elementary-school methods the first two are called 
principles of selection and the last two principles of organ- 
ization. This is wise, since in the lower grades the teacher 
must first select subject matter from many and varied 
sources and later organize it into lessons or projects. In 
the upper grades, where books are used so extensively, 
there is less supplementing and all four principles may be 
used to judge the books. This last statement does not 
mean that selection of outside material and supplementing 
of the text should stop. There should be much of such 
enrichment of the course in the upper grades also. The 
first two principles, then, may be used to select from 
varied sources the material desired and the last two to 
guide organization of it for teaching. Or all four may be 
applied to a textbook or other body of material to deter- 
mine its fitness. 
The following discussion will use Parker’s principles 
for a framework but will draw illustrations from Parker, 
McMurry, and Bobbitt, as well as from experience and 
observation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  266 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Selection of Subject Matter in Accord with Social 
Needs.—The expression ‘‘the three R’s’’ has come down 
to us from the day when the three subjects referred to 
practically constituted the field of elementary education. 
The inclusion from time to time of more history, of civics, 
manual training, shop work, art, music, ete., are indica- 
tions of the attempt of the school to keep pace with new 
social needs. 
Many processes in arithmetic, such as partial payments, 
eompound proportion, cube root, troy and apothecary’s 
calculations, are little used in life and have been 
dropped from many textbooks and courses of study. On 
the other hand, space is given to commercial arithmetic, 
business methods of computing interest, modern cal- 
culating machines, short cuts, etc. The plotting of curves 
and graphs and the making of statistical tables and com- 
putations is within the grasp of intermediate and gram- 
mar-grade children, and such material is widely used in 
everyday life. In the upper grades discussions of bank 
accounts, buying and selling small bonds, life insurance, 
house furnishing, and family budgets should replace 
much of the antiquated material on stocks and bonds and 
on obsolete business procedure. The daily advertisements 
of department stores make good sources of problems in- 
volving percentage, fractions, buying and selling, ete. In 
rural communities farm arithmetic is receiving its share 
of attention. There is a decided social value in addition 
to arithmetical practice in discovering the actual cost of 
fire and police protection to the city, the ward, the pre- 
cinct, the individual citizen. The cost of snow removal, 
the increased cost of street-car rides, will also furnish 
valuable material. The principle of relative values 
operates with the principle of social values in many cases. 
In history we see a shift from the usual accounts of 
wars and political administrations to discussion of indus- 
trial and commercial development. It is odd that in a
-P-A-G-E-287
    THE SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 267 
democracy like the United States, dedicated to a political 
policy of anti-imperialism, spending but a small propor- 
tion of its time in fighting, it has taken so long to dis- 
eover that the history material in the schools was largely 
purposeless. It is even more peculiar in the light of the 
tremendous economic advance that has characterized the 
development of this country. The development of natural 
resources, of transportation, of manufacturing, of com- 
merce and trade, has contributed the bulk of what the 
United States is, but little mention is made of these things 
in the common school history. Every effort should be 
made to see that such material forms the bulk of history 
courses. In the lower grades a good start has already 
been made in substituting a study of local conditions and 
industries in place of discussions of ancient days. The 
latter phase of history can well wait until some under- 
standing of the passage of time and of changing con- 
ditions of life had been acquired. 
Parker shows very clearly the necessity for a shift in 
emphasis from oral to silent reading in the intermediate 
and upper grades. Even in the lower grades there should 
be much silent reading. Time was when oral reading 
and oratory were socially indispensable, but to-day with 
its different social conditions and its wealth of printed 
material demands the ability to read rapidly for thought 
eontent. When the almost complete dependence upon 
printed matter for information upon which to base all 
our conclusions is realized, it is odd that training in silent 
reading has had such a hard fight for recognition. 
Civics has been added to the course because of the 
greater responsibility of the citizen in a democracy and 
because of the elimination of religion from the schools 
as a basis of morals. The content of civics courses is 
undergoing a radical change even at the present. The 
old formal material regarding the form of government,
-P-A-G-E-288
EE 
268 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
the content of the state constitution, rules and regula- 
tions, and taxation schemes is giving place to a considera- 
tion of the specifie duties of the citizen in his small 
political unit. Material dealing with the local problems 
of health work, fire protection, water supply, civic beauty, 
slums, and charity work should be selected in preference 
to discussions of the details of organization in the House 
of Representatives, the duties of the state supreme court, 
and the procedure in amending a state constitution. The 
direct primary and initiative and referendum have 
brought home very keenly to the average citizen his 
dense political ignorance and have supplied arguments 
for intelligent civic and political education in school. 
In the kindergarten we often see teachers following 
specific Froebelian procedures that were developed in a 
small village many years ago. Why modern children 
should study intensively the organization of a medieval 
village, inhabited by peasants of a bygone generation, is 
not clear. Instead of charcoal burners and faggot gath- 
erers it might be well to study the post man, the ash man, 
and the delivery boy. Automobiles, subways, elevated 
railroads, street cars, and auto delivery systems would be | 
far better than the industries of the ancient village. 
These suggested activities really embody Froebel’s basic 
principle of studying the child life about one better than 
do his own specific illustrations which were pertinent to a 
different situation. 
In nature study, lessons and material suitable for one 
region will be quite pointless in another. Sometimes the 
materials will even be unavailable. This subject illus- 
trates very well the need for differing outlines and organ- 
izations within the same state or within the same large 
region. This does not mean that students in one region 
are to have no work dealing with the flowers and animals 
of a different locality. Pictures, stories, trips to botanical
-P-A-G-E-289
  THE SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 269 
and zodlogical gardens should be used as extensively as 
conditions permit so that pupils may become reasonably 
familiar with regions other than their own. In this sub- 
ject particularly, and in allied subjects, there is much 
opportunity for the exercise of judgment by teachers in 
selecting material suited to the community and season. A 
rigid course of study in some instances calls for the study 
of wild flowers in January and of snow crystals in June. 
Large states might well write two or more outlines, each 
differing materially from the others, in order to adjust 
to different parts of the state. 
MeMurry points out that in New York City schools, 
at the time of the survey in 1913, the reading was pre- 
scribed both in amount and time for the whole city. 
Obviously the pupil population of such a city would differ 
as materially as do the populations of different sections 
of the United States, almost as much as do the populations 
of different countries. He shows the absurdity of sup- 
posing that reading material can be equally beneficial to 
children from the tenements, from the industrial sections, 
from Morningside Heights. Here we have an example, 
exaggerated perhaps, of the need of adjusting material 
within a community. The same point applies equally well 
to shop work, domestic science, millinery, ete. 
Selection of Subject Matter in Accord with the Principle 
of Relative Values.—Spencer’s essay on ‘‘ What Knowl- 
edge Is Most Worth”’ is the classic statement of this prin- 
ciple, though it has been variously reémphasized by later 
writers. The gist of the principle is that because of the 
numerous social needs, and the wealth of material, the 
limited time available, we must select from subject matter, 
all of which may be valuable, those things which are most 
valuable for the particular children we are considering. 
The principle, of course, is closely related to the one just 
discussed and will overlap with the two to follow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  270 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
In history, attention may be directed to the point that 
ancient history, colonization, and early days receive tar 
more than their due, while the happenings of the last 
decade or the last generation are all too often passed over 
hurriedly in the last few days of the term. Obviously 
much recent history is more valuable than the details of 
Colonial days. 
In geography, much time is often spent learning the 
capitals of all the states, the boundaries of many coun- 
tries. Some teachers have attempted to justify the former 
on the vague argument of patriotism. If learning the 
state capitals is patriotic, why not the county seats of all 
counties in the home state; why not the names of all the 
governors, the names of all who have introduced bills in 
Congress calling for monuments to our great men, ete., 
etc.? There is much else in geography concerning the 
products and industries of a region, the climate controls, 
the transportation systems, ete., that is of greater value 
economically, patriotically as well, which should have time 
and attention in place of the useless list of city names and 
boundary lines. The tracing, not drawing, of outline maps, 
the filling in of printed maps, the marking of product or 
industry maps, are of real value and give the pupil a good 
general idea of regions and locations, in addition to intro- 
ducing him to the diverse conditions under which some 
staple products are produced. Home geography should 
be stressed and may be used sometimes in connection with 
history stories dealing with local points of interest. 
In arithmetic, this principle and the foregoing one have 
worked hand in hand to eliminate much useless material. 
(Mention was made of many eliminations in the preceding 
discussion. One more might be mentioned, in that many 
texts now present but one method of computing interest 
in place of several confusing methods as formerly. 
Experimental research has contributed much to this
-P-A-G-E-291
    THE SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 271 
field and in some of the formal skills, such as arithmetic 
and spelling, it is possible to say with some exactness 
what shall be taught and what omitted. Old-time 
. spellers required the mastery of long lists of difficult 
words, most of which are never used in written or spoken 
intercourse, whereas the newer books, constructed in 
accord with the results of scientific inquiry, have reduced 
the number of words to be learned to between two and 
four thousand. In one study 14,250,000 words were counted, 
using children’s compositions as the source, and it was 
found that there were but 4,532 different words in all this 
number. The supervisor should be familiar with studies 
that have been made and be able to apply the findings. 
Much of the shift from formal grammar to language is 
in answer to emphasis upon relative values, though the 
fourth principle of organization in terms of the learner 
is also involved. The same is true of the shift from oral 
to silent reading, already mentioned under the previous 
principle. 
In hygiene and sanitation many states have required by 
law that instruction be given regarding the harmful 
effects of alcohol. It will be interesting to see how long 
after the enactment of the Prohibition Amendment this 
subject matter will remain uselessly in the course. 
Anatomy already gets more than its share of time, while 
disease-prevention measures are slighted. There is little 
or no discussion of everyday menaces to health to be 
found in every town and city. A parent once descended 
upon a school in wrath because his son reported that he 
had been sent out that morning to count the manure piles 
between school and Main Street. The principal confirmed 
the report and said that the next thing to be counted 
would be the open toilets and sewers around town. Fol- 
lowing that there would be demonstrations, lantern slides, 
and discussions as to the dangers of such things in a com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  272 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
munity. The local wells also would come in for examina- 
tion because they were held to be responsible for the 
annual epidemic of typhoid costing several lives each 
year. The resulting row between patron and school 
attracted the attention of the town council and local 
commercial club and resulted in a clean-up campaign to 
the great betterment of the town. The principal in ques- 
tion was slighting the textbook material on bones, 
muscles, and heart structure but was giving a striking 
example of selecting subject matter in accord with social 
needs and relative values. 
The principle of relative values would indicate that 
emphasis should be placed on care of the teeth and finger- 
nails, on bathing, on discussion of water supply, sewage 
disposal, covering of food offered for sale, ete., in pref- 
erence to learning the names of the bones of the body, the 
structure of the muscles, and the parts of the heart. 
Selection of Subject Matter So That Fewer Topics Are 
Treated Intensively as Opposed to Many Extensively.— 
This may be taken as a principle of organization to be 
applied to the wealth of material from which a teacher 
may select or it can be used as a principle with which to 
judge texts. Many recent texts are departing from the 
old encyclopedic treatment in which many unrelated and 
isolated facts were set down and are working toward an 
organization of material around a number of big topics 
or problems that bring in all necessary and related details 
where they belong, logically associated and vitally related 
to the main thought. 
Regarding the principle as one of organization of 
material gathered from several sources, we have again 
the underlying principle in a type lesson or in the project 
method. As was shown in the preceding chapters, these 
two types of teaching involve organization into a coherent 
whole of all necessary and related details and skills.
-P-A-G-E-293
     THE SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 273 
Thus the details that are necessary for understanding the 
central idea are logically associated and provided for. 
The project illustrates very well the interrelation of sub- 
ject matter and method. 
One of the best discussions of the antithesis between 
subject matter or textbooks made up of masses of unre- 
lated and isolated details and texts involving the treat- 
ment of a number of big topics or themes will be found 
in Parker’s texts.1 The old crazy-quilt organization of 
geography and history, the hodgepodge of facts, is held 
up to scorn, and specific illustrations of the better organ- 
ization into projects or type studies are given. 
McMurry quotes from a course of study in fourth. 
grade geography that, in one term’s work, called for the 
naming and location of six continents, five oceans, nine 
seas, seven gulfg and bays, seven mountain systems, fif- 
teen rivers, sixteen countries, eighteen cities, or eighty- 
three facts in all. There was nowhere in the course any 
attempt to relate these isolated facts, either to each other 
or to the life of the child. There was no mention of the 
great underlying causes of geographic change, of geo- 
graphic controls, ete., which can be taught simply enough 
to be grasped in the fourth, fifth, or sixth grade.” 
The newer geographies take up industries and discuss 
them as found in several parts of the country rather than 
to take arbitrary groups of states and discuss what is 
found there. When sections are taken for discussion, 
they are selected in terms of dominating climatic, indus- 
trial, or racial principles, rather than in terms of arbi- 
trary boundaries. 
The objection that such treatment does not guarantee

-P-A-G-E-294
  274 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
memory of essential facts is answered by experimental 
evidence that such treatment makes for the better mem- 
ory of more facts. The number of details involved in a 
project or type lesson may be as great or greater than in 
the old encyclopedic treatment, but in the project they 
all contribute to understanding the central idea and are 
logically associated with it. They need not be remem- 
bered as details, though many of them are. 
In history the bugbear of dates, events, and names 
largely disappears when the material is organized around 
some live and interesting problem involving many his- 
torical facts in their proper relationships. When, because 
of intelligent organization of material, reflective thought 
is substituted for rote memory, obviously better atten- 
tion and learning takes place. The supervisor can find 
much that will be of assistance to his teachers by search- 
ing the literature of the history project. 
Regarding nature study McMurry states: # 
Trees, birds, insects, and many other assigned topics need not 
be studied entirely as isolated specimens; but the studies should be 
grouped together so as to bring out the human interest in some 
larger problems, such as conservation of forests and bird life, 
influence of insects on agriculture, the usefulness of animals and 
plants to man, the development of individual animals and plants. 
Such organization is largely applicable to grades above the third. 
A limited number of trees and birds may profitably be considered 
in each primary year, but in grades above the first three there 
might well be intensive series of lessons which bring together the _ 
main facts about questions of general interest. 
The same writer emphasizes the great opportunities in 
hygiene to organize much excellent material around the 
real problems of health preservation, local conditions, 
fights with epidemics, ete. 
We are familiar with the isolated and logical treat-

ments in elementary science of such topics as air, water, 
heat, etc. Most of this material should be correlated in 
projects with material from geography and hygiene in 
order to bring out everyday usable facts about what 
otherwise remain vague scientific concepts. 
Selection of Subject Matter in Terms. of the Learner 
Instead of in Terms of the Subject.—Rousseau pointed 
out very sharply long ago that there are two arrange- 
ments of any set of facts or ideas. One chain of thought 
is developed logically in terms of underlying principles, 
namely, science. The other chain of thought is one in 
which each fact or idea calls up another fact or idea, as 
association, curiosity, and individual interest dictate. 
The latter sequence approximates the learning process, 
while the former is the organization of material that has 
been learned and thoroughly understood. 
In Chapter IV was discussed the use of pupils’ interests 
and experiences as a basis for teaching. The same prin- 
ciple holds for the selection and organization of subject 
matter. Material to be taught should be organized in 
terms of the learner in the sequence suggested by 
Rousseau, which is the way in which people learn new 
material. 
MeMurry found in a geography course of study the 
following outline, which was to be used in taking up the 
study of any country:*+ 
1, Location as determined by latitude and longitude, and with 
relation to surrounding countries and waters. 
2. Comparative size and shape. 
3. Mountain systems and important ranges; slopes and plains. 
4, River systems and important rivers. 
5. Important cities, their location and their comparative pop- 
ulation. 
6. Climate, industries, products, and areas of production. 
  
«Ibid., p. 131.

276 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
7. Form of government and general condition of the people as 
to education and ways of living. 
8. Exports and imports; trade, particularly with the United 
States. 
As McMurry well asks, what is the particular merit 
of this order of topics? It is neither logical nor psycho- 
logical. He points out that both teacher and class would 
probably wish to begin the study of Holland by discussing 
how much of that country has been reclaimed from the 
sea and kept under cultivation. Brazil might be entered 
upon through a discussion of the tremendous amount of 
coffee consumed in the United States. The recent World 
War has furnished an unlimited number of avenues of 
approach to geography and history that would take 
advantage of very keen interest on the part of the class. 
To follow rigidly the scheme of organization as outlined 
would be to violate not only the logic of the material but 
the interest and experience of the learner. 
History affords a good illustration of the difference 
between the so-called logical and the desired psycho- 
logical organization. History seems to demand by its 
very nature a chronological sequence, but we know that 
small children have no grasp of long-time intervals or 
recognition of the fact that ancient social conditions are 
out of keeping with present-day conditions. This subject 
should begin, as it does in many instances, with a study of 
the social conditions with which the pupil comes in direct 
contact. The first step away from home might be for city 
children the study of a farm. This would involve con- 
struction on the sand table, stories, pictures, trips if pos- 
sible, collection of pictures, making booklets, ete. Indian 
life, tales of the Vikings, of the shepherds and other early 
people would further lead the pupil into history as such. 
A study of the local community in some detail would 
then be in order. This will give the class an insight into

chronological sequence through concrete, understandable 
material. A description in Parker * of a study of Chicago 
by a third-grade class should be read carefully by super- 
visors, for it will be found of great assistance in helping 
teachers to introduce such work. ' 
Not long ago the subject matter in reading, drawing, 
and writing was selected and organized in terms of the 
units or elements of the processes involved, with little 
regard for the psychological processes of the learner. 
Children, and adults as well, grasp things as wholes and 
analyze later if necessity demands. For that reason 
writing and drawing courses based on a mastery of iso- 
lated curves and angles violate the learning processes 
and is even detrimental in many cases to quick, orderly 
learning. Writing and drawing should begin with crude 
efforts and improvement sought through comparison with 
better models. Writing scales have been of great value 
in this situation. 
In reading it is perhaps best to begin with word or 
sentence wholes, to pick out simple words or groups of 
words, and from them to work out the phonograms that 
may be necessary. Such phonic work as is necessary 
should be based upon sight words that were learned as 
wholes first. 
The shift from formal gymnastics to plays and games 
is in line with organizing subject matter in terms of the 
learner’s interests and activities. The muscular develop- 
ment and hygienic benefits supposed to be derived from 
gymnastics are much more efficiently obtained through 
-whole-hearted, happy play. 
In arithmetic the tables and combinations are still 
taught practically everywhere in logical sequence, despite 
the fact that there is considerable experimental evidence

-P-A-G-E-298
278 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
to show that some of them are much more difficult than 
others that follow them. Many of those now taught 
among the later ones are in reality easier than those that 
precede, but few arithmetic primers take these facts 
into account. The teaching of the fundamental opera- 
tions must come in for considerable revision in the near 
future in terms of experiments on the learning process. 
Grammar has long been a storm center in the matter 
of subject-matter selection, and there have been many 
arguments for and against it as a school subject. As it is 
commonly taught it probably has little real value to the 
pupil and certainly violates his interests and learning 
processes. McMurry criticizes a grammar course from 
which he qoutes a formal organization of isolated facts: ° 
The value of this course in grammar must be seriously ques- 
tioned for three reasons: 
1, It is no source of mental life to the average pupil; and, 
being made prominent in the crucial sixth year of school, tends 
to drive children out of school. 
2, Experience within the elementary schools has shown that 
the rules of grammar, learned apart from composition, literature, 
and conversation, have very little effect on the correct use of 
English. 
3. The time required for this kind of instruction must be 
mainly taken from composition and literature and thus seriously 
weakens the appeal they make to children. 
The course further provides that in the eighth grade 
emphasis shall be placed upon the connection between 
composition and grammar. As McMurry puts it, after 
eight years of dull work the pupils are to discover the 
motive for it all! The course criticized is not unlike many 
now in use in the country. 
Other Discussions of Subject-Matter Selection.—There 
are many other discussions available in this field, of

course, and the supervisor should be familiar with the 
best ones. One of the best modern discussions of the 
philosophy underlying the selection of subject matter, 
with special reference to the present world situation, will 
be found in Bobbitt’s The Curriculum. This is a scholarly 
treatment of the whole problem which points out the needs 
of the social group and attempts to show how to meet them 
through education. Another smaller book by the same 
author, What the Schools Teach and Might Teach, which is 
based upon the Cleveland survey, contains many helpful 
discussions and concrete applications. Another excellent 
discussion, more recent than Bobbitt’s, will be found in 
Bonser’s The Elementary School Curriculum. A rather 
unique and interesting treatment which will be of value is 
Meriam’s Child Life and the Curriculum. 
In Hall-Quest’s The Textbook, pages 82-120, will be 
found a series of score cards or outlines by which to judge 
subject matter. This book covers the entire field of text- 
book making; it considers content only incidentally, but 
gathers discussions of it from many school systems and 
school men. In addition to the standards for subject mat- 
ter in general, there are some constructed for judging some 
ene subject particularly, as, for example, history. 
Mention has been made from time to time in preceding 
pages and for various purposes of certain Yearbooks of the 
National Society for the Study of Education. We may 
emphasize again their value. The Fourteenth, Sixteenth, 
and Seventeenth, Part I in each case, and the Eighteenth, 
Part II, contain the reports of the Committee on the Econ- 
omy of Time in Education. They contain much very 
valuable discussion of subject matter that has been selected 
in accord with experimental results or good theory. Many 
of the principles are doubly valuable in that they are 
directly applicable to the teaching of certain material, as 
well as the selection of it. The Nineteenth and Twentieth 
|
-P-A-G-E-300
280 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Yearbooks, Part I in each case, are entitled ‘‘New Materials 
of Instruction,’’ and contain much material reported by 
teachers who have used it and found it adapted to the 
pupils. 
“The Speyer School Curriculum’? and the Baltimore 
County Course of Study, mentioned previously, are good 
examples of well selected subject matter and should be 
suggestive to supervisors. 
A more technical treatment of this topic, applicable to 
the junior high school more specifically, will be found in 
Rugg and Clark, Scientific Method in the Reconstruction 
of Ninth-Grade Mathematics.” A digest of the same 
material will be found in the front of Fundamentals of 
High School Mathematics by the same authors. 
The Doctrine of Formal Discipline as a Factor in 
Subject-Matter SelectionFor generations this doctrine 
has played a large and important part in the determina, 
tion of school subject matter. Material that could not 
be justified on any other grounds whatsoever was 
retained and is being retained in the curriculum because 
of its ‘‘disciplinary’’ value. Much other material that 
has undoubted claim for inclusion because of its imme- 
diate, practical, social value is denied admittance, or 
admitted grudgingly, because it is said to lack ‘‘dis- 
ciplinary’’ value. 
It is not necessary here to go into the details of the 
old and sometimes violent controversy in regard to 
discipline and transfer. Suffice it to say that the partisan 
debates have subsided sufficiently so that a clearer view 
of the problem is possible. No one now claims that dis- 
cipline is an inherent element in a subject that will carry 
over automatically and magically. Neither is the claim 
made that there is no transfer of training. Much sound

THE SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 281 
theory is available, and not a little experimental evidence, 
to show that there is some transfer in almost all learning. 
The method of transfer, the method of teaching to guar- 
antee transfer, is being sought out and some suggestive 
experiments have been completed. 
The doctrine will continue to play a large part in the 
determination of curricula, consciously or unconsciously, 
for a long time to come. However, the supervisor can 
safely disregard it as a standard by which to select ma- 
terial, provided that the standards as outlined in this 
chapter, or other like treatments, are carefully applied. 
It will never be safe to exclude socially valuable material 
for the sake of other material of doubtful social utility 
for which ardent disciplinary claims are made. On the 
other hand, the practical material need not be frowned 
upon because it is said to lack disciplinary value. The 
fact is that discipline, if there be such, is obtainable in 
slightly differing degrees in any subject. Pupils can be 
trained to see and solve problems in hand work as well as 
in Latin; to gather data, organize and evaluate them, 
draw and prove inferences in hygiene as well as, or better 
than, in classical literature. They can be given oppor- 
tunity for the exercise of reflective thought as easily and 
efficiently in the field of local problems as in studies con- 
cerning the social customs of the ancients. If there are 
such things as habits of attention and concentration, of 
accuracy and neatness, they can be built up as well in 
economics as in Euclid. Discipline and transfer depend 
not so much upon the nature of the subject, as upon the 
method of teaching, the emphasis placed upon the trans- 
ferable element, and the pupil’s power of generalization. 
Beware, then, of the teacher who believes that grammar 
will teach the pupil to ‘‘think’’ but who also believes that 
nature study will not do so. The supervisor should be 
able to set forth clearly what thinking is, how it may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
282 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  obtained in the various subjects, and what is perhaps 
most important, how some of the so-called disciplinary 
subjects do not afford the opportunity that is commonly 
attributed to them. 
One caution here, which applies algo to the use of the 
standard of social values. This latter term must not be 
interpreted too narrowly; there are other social values 
than those involved in earning one’s living. Some sub- 
jects mentioned in the preceding paragraph as being less 
desirable than others from a disciplinary point of view 
are not necessarily to be excluded. They may be justified 
on other grounds. Whatever the grounds, however, they 
must be definite and understandable and not vague, indef- 
inite, ‘‘disciplinary’”’ or ‘‘cultural’’ arguments. 
The Age of the Learner as a Factor in Subject-Matter 
Selection—Many people believe that children cannot 
reason during the years preceding adolescence, and there- 
fore the subject matter for those years should be con- 
eerned with the formation of necessary habits, motor 
skills, and associations. Adolescence is thought to be the 
period in which reason is born, and subject matter can 
then be of such nature as exercise that process. 
However, there is an ever increasing amount of experi- 
mental evidence to show, and theory now takes the view, 
that the processes involved in acquiring habits, in form- 
ing arbitrary associations, in reflective thought, are all 
present at all ages. Subject matter, therefore, cannot be 
determined on the basis of the process supposed to be 
uppermost at any given age. The amount of experience, 
the store of information possessed at any age is the de- 
termining factor rather than the psychological processes 
supposed to be typical of that age. This store of informa- 
tion, plus the natural interest of the pupil in things 
around him, will offer cues for the selection of material 
suitable for any age. Care should be taken to see that
-P-A-G-E-303
THE SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 283 
stories, readers, and other texts discuss experiences and 
things within the knowledge of average boys and girls of 
the age for which the books are designed. The language 
used should be free from words, idioms, and expressions 
of which the children will probably be ignorant. 
The importance of the principle of apperception in this 
matter will be made clearer through studying Stanley 
Hall’s Content of Children’s Minds on Entering School, 
wherein it is shown that the average city child is woefully 
ignorant of everyday things in nature and on the farm. 
Doubtless rural school children are equally ignorant of 
things in the city. Obviously subject matter dealing with 
such things where there is no approach or preparation 
would be beyond the learner. Other valuable discussions 
of the same point will be found in Thorndike, Principles 
of Teaching, pages 42-50, and in Parker’s text on ele- 
mentary methods, pages 168-188. 
The Mechanical Make-up of Textbooks.—This topic is 
not logically a part of subject-matter selection but. will 
usually be called into play when supervisors are exam- 
ining new textbooks for content; hence brief reference 
to it is in order. Hall-Quest sums up the general principle 
as follows: * 
A good textbook should include a mechanical make-up based 
upon accepted standards of hygiene, art, design, adaptability to 
purpose, and upon sound principles of economic production, pro- 
vided that the last named should never be interpreted to mean 
that an inferior textbook be selected. 
This author presents a number of score cards for judg- 
ing the mechanical make-up of a book, which are too long 
for reproduction here but which should be utilized by the 
supervisor in making up a score card to meet his par-

284 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
ticular needs. The following is a suggestive summary, 
made up from several sources: 
Size: Preferably small enough to be held easily in one hand. 
History and geography texts will be controlled somewhat, of 
course, by the amount of material and size of maps. 
Exterior: Pleasing color and design. Stiff, durable covers. 
The back must be strong and compact but flexible enough to 
allow the book to lie open. 
Illustrations: Many good pictures that are relevant to the text 
material and in which some consistent standard of comparison is 
manifest; that is, objects of different sizes in the world should be 
shown in different size pictures. Many small children believe lions 
and dogs to be about the same size because all the pictures they 
see are the same size. Photographs are preferable, though good 
drawings are valuable. Old pictures or those very general in 
content are to be avoided, since they do not appeal to the natural 
interests of the pupil. 
Maps: Again there is necessity for consistent comparison. 
Many people think Australia to be about the size of Texas because 
all maps show it so. Maps should be large enough and should 
actually be used in connection with the text. 
Graphs, curves, etc.: There should be much use of graphical 
representation of abstractions. Tables should be compactly or- 
ganized. All such illustrations should be clearly explained and 
up-to-date. 
Titles, heads, italics: Should be used freely but logically. Cor- 
rect use of heads and italics, together with short paragraphs aids 
reading materially. 
Index, table of contents, etc.: Books should be carefully exam- 
ined to see that such formal aids are carefully organized. Many 
books contain incorrect ones or none at all. Vocabularies also in 
books demanding them should be scrutinized. 
Paper: A pure white, non-glossy grade is the best, aiding legi- 
bility and avoiding eyestrain. 
Print: Young children require shorter lines and larger letters 
than older ones. Above the fourth grade an eleven-point type, 
about 1.5 mm., in height with leading of 25 mm. Space between 
words about 2mm. Lines should be about 60 to 80 mm., maximum 
90 mm. 
First grade: type, 2.6 mm., leading 4.5 mm. 
Second and third grades: type 2.0 mm., leading 4 mm.

Summary For THE SUPERVISOR 
Subject matter, both that already in the curriculum and 
that urged for inclusion, should be carefully scrutinized. 
The nature of the learner and the aim of education should 
be the guiding principles, and subject matter should pass 
the following tests: 
OvuTLINE FOR THE EvauuaTion or Sussecr MatrTer 
1. Is the material of distinct, definite value to the individual 
as a member of the community or part of the community 
he lives in? As a citizen? (Value must not be interpreted 
too narrowly, neither must it become vague.) 
(a) Can this value be shown and supported with definite ob- 
jective evidence? 
(b) In subjects not admitting objective measurement can the 
value be stated logically and coherently in terms of 
sound theory? (Avoid vague, indefinite statements 
in regard to culture or discipline). 
2. Is material undoubtedly valuable being retained in the eur- 
riculum to the exclusion of other material that is more 
valuable? (Relative values.) 
3. Is it organized and written in terms of the pupils’ experi- 
ences and understanding? Does it appeal to their interests? 
4. Does it approximate the project organization: that is, a 
coherent, interwoven whole, or series of such wholes, 
around a worth-while center or core? (Avoid series of 
unrelated facts, or lists of isolated statements.) 
5. Is it of such nature as to stimulate active, aggressive think- 
ing or motor activity? If drill material, is there provision 
for cumulative repetition?

  CHAPTER XIII 
THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS IN ADJUSTING INSTRUCTION 
TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
In Chapter IV was given a discussion of individual dif- 
ferences and their relation to the improvement of instruc- 
tion. The present chapter will be given over to an outline 
of the means of determining the nature and amount of dif- 
ference. There are two chief fields of interest here, edu- 
cational measurements and intelligence tests. Both types 
of tests have performed other service than that connected 
with the determination and treatment of individual differ- 
ences, and such other services will be referred to as 
expedient during the discussion. 
Educational measurements is the name given to that 
group of scales, tests, and examinations which inquire into 
the pupil’s achievement or rate of progress in school 
subjects. It is not necessary for our purpose to go into 
the history of the measurement movement or into the 
details of scale making. The supervisor can obtain this 
information, and sample tests, by consulting the bibliog- 
raphy. Many of the tests, such as the Thorndike -Writing 
Scale, Ayres Writing Scale, Courtis Tests, Woody Scales, 
Gray’s Silent Reading Tests, Stone Reasoning Tests, etc., 
have become famous, and others are rapidly becoming 
known. 
Intelligence tests are of two kinds, depending on whether 
they are designed for individual or group testing. Of the 
former type, the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon 
Seale is probably the best known. Among the group tests 
288
-P-A-G-E-309
  THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 289 
none is yet so well known as the Binet tests are among the 
individual examinations, nor are any others so accurate and 
reliable. 
EpucatTionaL MEASUREMENTS 
In regard to the tests included under the head of educa- 
tional measurements Gray says in part:+ 
One of the most/impartial and effective means of improving the 
quality of teaching is the constant use of tests as a routine part 
of instruction. ... Definite standards of accomplishment are 
determined and adopted. Teachers are instructed concerning 
major points of emphasis for the system as a whole and for 
specific schools and grades. . . . ‘The most significant results which 
come from the intelligent use of tests are renewed interest in 
teaching problems and the spirit of investigation which is devel- 
oped. The teacher who scrutinizes her work carefully and records 
accurately, becomes more open-minded, more interested in ade- 
quate proofs, and less willing to follow the line of least resistance 
by accepting blindly all things on authority. It is unnecessary to 
add that such an attitude is fundamental and important if gen- 
uine progress is to be made in the improvement of teaching. The 
use of tests furnishes evidence that the results of teaching are 
relatively good or poor.. 
Uses of Tests.—The big general aim of all the work in 
measurements is the improvement of teaching. Teachers 
and supervisors should be careful that this aim is not lost 
sight of among the details involved in giving and inter- 
preting the tests. Several phases of this aim can be dis- 
tinguished. The following list is not final or complete 
and supervisors will probably wish to add to it, organiz- 
ing their problems accordingly. Tests seem to be of use: 
(1) in determining definite standards of accomplishment 
in the different subjects, (2) in measuring pupil progress, 
(3) in comparing (within limits) teachers, rooms, build-

ings, methods, (4) in diagnosing a given situation (in the 
latter instance attention may be directed to the teacher, 
the class as a whole, or to individual pupils, to teaching 
methods or administrative procedure), (5) in the scientific 
study of methods. This summary is somewhat general, 
of course, and the points are not mutually exclusive. For | 
specific statements regarding the uses and benefits of any 
designated scale or test the supervisor is referred to Mon- 
roe, DeVoss and Kelly, Educational Tests and Measure- 
ments. This book is given over to a discussion of the best 
known tests and their uses. 
The Determination of Definite Standards of Accomplish- 
ment.—What the teacher is to accomplish is set forth in the 
course of study. It gives the standards of accomplishment 
in terms of subject matter to be covered. This subject 
matter calls for differing kinds of activities on the part of 
the pupils, but neither the subject matter nor the activity 
itself is the end. The result of the activity, the change in 
the learner, is the educational result desired. It has been 
easy to write down the subject-matter requirements and to 
justify them in terms of pedagogical and psychological 
theory, but too much reliance in such paper requirements 
makes for formalism. It has also been easy in a superficial 
way to determine what activity resulted. The exact nature 
and amount of the activity, however, together with its 
actual result upon the learner, has been neglected. Fur- 
thermore, pupils differ most materially in their natures 
and in their individual reactions to the same subject mat- 
ter and the same teaching method. These last named, and 
vitally important phases of teaching are coming into their 
own through the making and applying of standard tests. 
The results to be obtained are coming to be set down in 
terms of actual standards measurable in mathematically 
precise terms as age and grade scores. Not only are the 
standards being set up, but the derivation of them has    
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 291 
directed attention more closely to the requirements of real 
life outside the schools. 
Very likely problems involved in determining these 
standards will play but little part in the work of the 
average supervisor, the bulk of the work being done by 
special investigators at universities or departments of edu- 
cational research. The supervisor should be familiar with 
the results obtained by the research experts and either 
utilize them himself or see that they are brought to the 
attention of his teachers. An excellent guide to the sources 
of literature dealing with this phase of measurement work 
will be found in the Elementary School Journal for Decem- 
ber, 1917, Rugg, ‘‘How to Keep in Touch with the Quanti- 
tative Literature of Education.’’ A good brief discussion 
of the statistics involved will be found in Monroe, DeVoss 
and Kelley, pages 273-283. The statistics involved in tab- 
ulating and interpreting the tests will be given later in this 
chapter. 
Most of the advance in this field has been made in the 
formal or tool subjects which admit of measurement more 
easily than do the content subjects. The tests available are 
usually equipped with tables showing age and grade accom- 
plishment. The establishment of standards is going for- 
ward more and more rapidly in the content subjects, and 
there are already many scales of considerable accuracy and 
value. 
The Determination of Progress—The determination of 
progress is closely related to the foregoing topic and may 
be regarded as a part of it. The specific standards just dis- 
cussed are, of course, measures’ of progress, and the tests 
given from time to time determine how nearly the individ- 
ual pupil is approximating normal progress toward the 
desired end. 
The Courtis tests in arithmetic, probably the most 
famous in this field, have as an integral part of the scheme 
   
-P-A-G-E-312
  292 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
practice material that directs and aids progress toward the 
given standard. The tests that do not have practice ma- 
terial nevertheless direct the teacher’s attention to the 
pupils’ weaknesses or to the difficulty that is obstructing 
progress. 
Many of the individual tests have time limits attached to 
them, and there is an indication, also, in regard to the 
number of tests or amount of practice necessary in attain- 
ing the given age or grade standard. This fixes in some 
degree the time allowable for a certain amount of progress. 
This item is far more vital and important than the simple 
statement would indicate. The demands for economy of 
time in school have been answered in part through utilizing 
the facts in regard to accomplishment and amount of prac- 
tice. The classic illustration of debate on this topic is the 
experience of Rice in presenting, a quarter of a century ago, 
facts showing that children drilled in spelling for ten min- 
utes a day did just as well as those drilled for forty min- 
utes. His findings were greeted with ridicule and derision, 
but since then educational theory has undergone a sweep- 
ing change and the time element in relation to drill is 
scrutinized very carefully. 
The progress of both bright and dull pupils can be aided 
through the application of tests. The bright one, his abil- 
ity determined by measurement, can be sent ahead through 
irregular promotion or be given extra work, while the dull 
one is placed where he can do better work. Intelligence 
tests should be used in conjunction with educational tests in 
such cases. A more specific discussion of diagnosis will be 
found a few pages further on. 
Comparing Teachers, Buildings, Systems—Judgments 
of the excellence of a teacher’s work, especially judgments 
comparing the work of two teachers, rested largely upon 
opinion until the advent of the standardized test. Testing 
two groups of pupils of the same grade and general age 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 293 
distribution who have been put through the same course 
of study by different teachers affords a good comparative 
index of ability for the two teachers involved. A caution 
must be especially emphasized here: care must be taken to 
see that the two groups tested were really in the same con- 
dition, approximately, when they entered upon) the work. 
Individuals and whole classes may suffer materially from 
poor teaching the preceding year, and the later teacher 
would appear to have done poor work. Sickness, absence 
and irregular attendance, home conditions, degree of effort 
by pupils, distribution of intelligence in the class, ete., will 
all affect materially the scores made. Other things being 
equal, tests afford a good basis of comparison. When they 
are used, however, to rate or grade teachers, either indi- 
vidually or comparatively, or to promote them, the greatest 
eare should be exercised to see that the history of the grade 
and of the individual pupils is gathered and taken into con- 
sideration along with the tests. 
Supervisors will find it much easier to get results from 
teachers, school boards, or school patrons when comparisons 
are based upon precise, measured results instead of on 
opinion. The presentation of scores for local schools and 
for other systems or groups of schools, both measured by 
the same impersonal and scientifically determined stand- 
ard, does much to eliminate the suspicion of favoritism or 
prejudice. 
The Diagnostic Value of Tests—All of the foregoing dis- 
cussion deals in a measure with the results of diagnosis. 
Both teacher and supervisor are, however, concerned with 
more than the setting of standards, the measuring of prog- 
ress, and the comparison of teachers and buildings. They 
must know the reasons for slow or irregular progress, the 
individual abilities and weaknesses of the pupils, the weak 
places in the teacher’s procedure, ete., in order that teach- 
ing may be adapted and a better learning process stimu-

lated. The tests will contribute in greater or less degree 
to a more exact determination of the points listed. 
Monroe cites a city superintendent as saying that the 
pupils in his schools had taken a number of tests but did no 
better work afterwards than they had done before.2 The 
misunderstanding of tests and their uses, implied in the 
superintendent’s statement, is fairly common. If the 
pupil’s papers are not examined and analyzed for the pur- 
pose of prescribing remedial instruction, it is a waste of 
time to give the tests. They are not teaching devices with 
which to stimulate interest, though they will do that; 
neither will the pupils’ abilities increase merely through 
taking them. They are for the purpose of supplying teacher 
and supervisor with information upon which to base the 
direction of the learning process. 
Making and giving the tests has brought out many unsus- 
pected facts in regard to the processes involved in the sup- 
posedly simple operations in arithmetic, spelling, reading, 
and writing. In arithmetic, for instance, it has been found 
that adding a column of two or three figures is not at all 
the same process as adding a column of eight or ten figures. 
Courtis lists seven processes involved in addition, three in 
subtraction, six in multiplication, nine in division, all of 
them requiring a specific habit or automatism. Some of the 
Courtis tests automatically diagnose the difficulty for any 
specific pupil. 
The differentiation between oral and silent reading has 
only been made in comparatively recent times. Most lay 
critics and many teachers will not admit there is much 
difference, but as a matter of fact there are several dif- 
ferent and important processes involved in silent reading 
alone.

ber of processes, each valuable for diagnosing a case of 
poor writing, is a monumental piece of work, showing 
very clearly how the composite thing, a written word, 
involves several factors and abilities on the part of the 
pupil. 
Many other illustrations could be cited. As has been 
stated, one of the most important duties of teacher or 
supervisor is to give standard tests and analyze the 
results to determine exactly what is the matter, which 
process has been neglected in drill, which is hard for most 
pupils, easy for most, etc. Just what things are done by 
the supervisor to use or bring teachers to use the tests to 
best advantage? 
Using the Tests.—Monroe organizes the use of tests in 
supervision into four steps, (1) giving them, (2) tab- 
ulating the results, (3) interpreting the results, (4) pre- 
scribing and carrying out remedial treatment.* 
Gwing the Tests——Practically all the tests are accom- 
panied by sheets of specific directions and not a few have 
elaborate manuals. The conditions under which the test 
is taken, the manner of giving the directions, even the 
exact wording in some cases, all affect the results and 
care must be exercised to see that the administration of 
any test conforms to standardized conditions. Only by 
exercising this care can usable results be obtained. 
The supervisor should give the tests himself or have an 
expert do it. After acquiring facility he should train 
enough teachers so that a few of the best tests can be 
given whenever needed in any building. It is better, 
probably, to train teachers in a few tests at a time and 
never attempt to give facility in the use of a large num- 
ber. The details of several tests, learned in quick suc-

cession, become confusing and tend to discourage the 
teacher. 
An interesting programme for bringing teachers to a 
realization of the need for testing and for introducing 
them to the technique is outlined by S. 8S. Brooks. At a 
teachers’ meeting mimeographed copies of an answer 
taken from a pupil’s paper were handed out and the 
teachers asked to grade it. No instructions were given, 
and when the results were tabulated on the board, such 
wide divergence was shown as to stagger the group. The 
methods of grading were then analyzed and the group 
made aware as never before of the necessity for some 
fairer and more uniform method of testing pupils than by 
erratically graded papers. At a second meeting a list of 
questions was given out to be weighted by the teachers. 
Again a wide divergence was shown in estimating the 
difficulty and worth of the questions. The teachers were 
then asked to take the list home and give it to one of their 
classes. At the third meeting the answer papers were 
graded and the results tabulated. The number of times a 
question was missed or answered was tabulated, as well 
as the pupils’ total scores. Not only did the grades differ 
materially, but many questions were shown to be too hard 
or too easy, though the teacher’s rating of the week 
before had not indicated such a thing. At the fourth 
meeting the group was then introduced to standard meas- 
urements, the method of giving them and of interpreting 
the results. Probably this exact programme would not 
be necessary with groups containing many well trained 
teachers because most of them realize the need for tests 
already. However, many suggestions can be gained from 
this plan.

THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 297 
On the same topic Gray says in part: * 
In this connection supervisors find it necessary to provide sys- 
tematic training and instruction for teachers., The following 
methods [may be used] . . . Conferences held in which teachers 
are informed concerning the purposes and values of tests, and are 
trained to use them effectively through discussion, demonstration, 
and use. The use of tests [may be] begun in one or two buildings 
under the immediate supervision of the principal or superintend- 
ent. As the teachers of these schools become more or less expert 
they are relieved of some of their responsibilities so that they can 
instruct teachers in other buildings. This plan has been employed 
successfully in Rochester, New York. As soon as teachers develop 
skill in the intelligent use of tests they are encouraged to adopt 
them as a routine part of their work. The supervisor serves in 
this connection as a progressive leader in securing results along 
several lines. . . . The results of tests are thoroughly discussed so 
that accurate interpretations of their significance can be made. 
The supervisor holds himself responsible for assembling the scien- 
tifie material which relates to the problems under consideration 
and for their presentation and interpretation to the teaching staff. 
Provision is made for the frequent discussion of studies which 
have been made by teachers within the system. Every possible 
opportunity is utilized to stimulate interest on the part of the 
teachers in making detailed studies of their problems. 
Tabulating the Results——The tabulation of the results 
and the arrangement of them into tables, graphs, curves, 
ete., often involve a large amount of detail work, and 
clerical help should be provided. Hither clerks, training 
teachers, or older pupils should be paid to do this, because 
the teacher’s time is far too valuable for other purposes 
to be used in this way. 
The statistics involved in these tabulations are made 
by some people very complex, intricate, and difficult. 
For ordinary purposes this is not necessary; there are 
only a few terms and processes the teacher needs to know. 
Any teacher should know what is meant by the following 
  
* Loe. cit., p. 269. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  298 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
terms: normal distribution curve, bi-nodal curve, surface 
of frequency, graph, median, mode, average, central tend- 
ency, frequency, deviation, correlation. She should be 
able to make the graphs and curves, to compute the 
median, mode, and deviation. She should be able to make 
a table that shows at a glance the highest and lowest 
Scores and the sequence from one to the other. Probably 
the computations of correlations, other than the simplest 
ones, can be left to the supervisor. 
The supervisor should know more exactly about the 
true and approximate medians, percentiles, quartiles, 
probable error, ete., but it is doubtful if these terms and 
methods of computing them are of great value to the 
teacher. The teacher can be given the necessary guidance 
by the supervisor in cases involving these latter terms. 
Interpreting the Results; Prescribing and Carrying Out 
Remedial Treatment.—These two phases of the work are 
treated together because of their obvious relationship. 
An excellent summary is found in Monroe: *® 
Different classes as a whole have different needs, and the indi- 
vidual members of a class have a great variety of pupil needs. 
The first step, however, in interpreting the scores of a class is to 
ascertain the needs that are common to the class as a whole or to 
large groups within the class. This should be followed by an 
individual interpretation of the scores of those pupils at the 
extremes of the group, particularly of those conspicuously below 
standard. At present, we do not have sufficient scientific informa- 
tion to permit us to formulate complete statements of the pupil 
needs which are indicated-by the various combinations of symp- 
toms. In the absence of such formulations, it will be helpful to 
outline a general procedure which may be followed in interpreting 
the scores of a class after they have been tabulated on the class 
record sheet. In order that the subject may be as concrete as 
possible, it will be stated in terms of the Courtis Standard 
Research Tests, Series B. However, one can easily adapt the 
general plan to any other test. 
  
*W. 8. Monroe, loc. cit.  
-P-A-G-E-319
  THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 299 
In a rough way we may group the great variety of combinations 
of scores of classes under six cases as follows: 
Case 1, Class medians below standard in both rate and 
accuracy. 
Case 2. Class medians for rate below standard with satis- 
factory or high accuracy medians. 
Case 3. Class medians for accuracy below standard with sat- 
isfactory or high rate medians. 
Case 4. Scores of members of class widely scattered. 
Case 5. Irregular development; class medians in one test up to 
or above standard with class medians in another test distinctly 
below standard. 
Case 6. Class medians for both rate and accuracy up to or 
above standard with the individual scores grouped closely about 
the medians. 
Any particular class may exhibit certain combinations of these 
conditions. For example, the median rate in a test (i.e., addition) 
may be below standard with a satisfactory or high accuracy 
median and at the same time the scores of the members of the 
class may be widely scattered. 
For each of these cases, it is possible to list certain probable 
needs. All of these needs may not apply to a given class but 
some of them will almost certainly be appropriate. In general, 
it will be profitable to investigate these needs first and determine 
which of them apply to the class in question. The most prob- 
able needs for each case are given below. 
The following is a very abbreviated summary of Mon- 
roe’s detailed discussion of probable needs: * 
Case 1. Probably inefficient teaching, though some other causes 
might enter into extraordinary cases. Specifically, the difficulty 
probably is that drill periods are not utilized to the best advantage. 
Case 2. Lack of speed drills is the probable cause. Or, the 
speed drills have not been properly motivated. The devices used 
may have focused attention elsewhere than on the process needing 
drill. 
Case 3. May be due to improper conditions at time of test. 
Pupils often have to be trained to work at fair speed under 
pressure of a time limit. One of the several processes involved in 
addition may be weak. 
* Tbid., pp. 96-102. 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
    300 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Case 4. In this case there is need for more individual testing 
‘than in any of the others. There should be an inquiry into the 
past history of the pupils. 
Case 5. Irregular development is made possible because there 
are a number of types of examples. Emphasis in teaching can 
be shifted to meet the trouble. The Courtis Standard Research 
Tests, Series B, can only show irregularities between the four 
fundamental operations. A series of diagnostic tests will reveal 
irregularities between different types within the same operation. 
Case 6. When medians and distributions are satisfactory 
there are still needs to be met. Promotion for some pupils to a 
higher grade may be indicated. Less time to this subject and 
more to others, or opportunity to take a new subject might be 
involved. 
Locating a class under one of these possible cases is the 
first step in interpretation and is necessarily somewhat 
erude. The teacher should examine not only the scores 
but also the individual papers of the pupils. Another 
helpful device is to watch the pupil as he works or have 
him express orally what processes he goes through as he 
works. All the many possible errors in arithmetic, a 
wrong combination, a misplaced decimal, irregular col- 
umns, wrong reading or copying, incorrect manipulation 
of fractions, ete., can be detected and corrected. Once 
the difficulty is seen, the teacher can then adapt her teach- 
ing methods. In some of the cases cited above the need 
was for more intelligent application of the rules for drill. 
In Case 2 probably the rule regarding waste of time on 
non-essential details should have been applied more care- 
fully. 
In reading, the tests may show a vocabulary lack or 
there may be too much emphasis on oral reading and not 
enough on silent reading. In silent reading pupils may 
differ in speed and comprehension. In case of too great em- 
phasis on oral reading, material calling for interpretation 
should be introduced. Games involving printed directions 
are good devices. Written directions in regard to some pro-  
-P-A-G-E-321
THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 301 
cedures in school might be utilized occasionally. Supple- 
mentary material can be read and reported to the class by 
the pupil in his own words. Experienced teachers will 
have or can evolve intelligent devices in this matter. The 
supervisor should be on the lookout for good ones and 
organize them for distribution. 
Spelling has a considerable number of possible errors. 
Many are due to mispronunciation, others to careless pro- 
nunciation and writing. Phonic irregularities in the lan- 
guage account for still others. Tests will show which 
words a class needs to study. Drill devices can then be 
arranged to meet the need. Interesting paragraphs can 
be prepared with blanks to be filled in with the difficult 
words. There is some argument regarding showing pupils 
certain errors and telling them to avoid them. Provided 
the pupil is making the error constantly, his attention 
can probably be directed to it safely, especially if the 
correct form is emphasized also and kept before him. 
Handwriting tests will reveal whether the trouble is 
with speed, slant, letter formation, or spacing. The posi- 
tion of the pupil at the desk, the type of finger or arm 
movement will condition the product. 
Other school subjects could be discussed as have been the 
few preceding ones. The supervisor should be familiar with 
such discussions of remedial treatment as will be found in 
Monroe, DeVoss and Kelly, in Wilson and Hoke, and in 
the periodical literature. He should also be familiar with 
administrative schemes to meet the needs shown by tests.® 
The Reliability of the Tests——Many of the tests are so 
well known and come from authors of such eminence in 
the field that teachers and supervisors feel safe in accept- 
ing them. This is probably the only procedure open at. 
present. Some of the tests, however, are open to question 
®See the Bibliographical Notes to this chapter.

and should be made the subject of exhaustive test by 
some candidate looking for a doctorate thesis. Mean- 
while supervisors, in doubtful cases, should examine care- 
fully the methods of derivation and standardization back 
of tests. In the case of the new tests being put upon the 
market with great rapidity and possessing little originality 
caution should be exercised. The spur of monetary 
returns is so great that many poor and mediocre tests are 
in print. 
Monroe proposes the following four criteria for judging 
a test: (1) it must be objective, (2) must be arranged in 
steps along a scale of equal units, (3) must measure the 
achievement or ability it purports to measure, (4) must be 
brief and simple. The third requirement is the most dif- 
ficult to determine and is the one on which most doubt 
is cast in the case of weak tests. We might add to Mon- 
roe’s points the one mentioned in the preceding para- 
graph, namely, insistence on expert derivation and scien- 
tific standardization. 
INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
When pupils did poor work in the old-fashioned exam- 
inations or fell below standard in the educational tests 
just discussed, the statement was often made by teachers 
and parents that the children could do the work all right 
if they wanted to. Most parents still believe, if a child 
falls below standard, that he could do the required work 
if he were made to or if he had good teachers. The 
evolution and application of intelligence tests is making 
very clear the fallacy of such a view. 
The cases of children below standard should be thor- 
oughly and carefully investigated. As much of their past 
experience as possible should be noted, especially health 
record, school history, home conditions, heredity, ete. 
Many individual. cases will be found to be due to con-
-P-A-G-E-323
ee ee eee ee ee ee 
THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 303 
tinued ill health, irregular attendance, poor home condi- 
tions, malnutrition, too frequent change of school, ete. 
Such cases can be brought up to standard by careful 
treatment, the nature of which will be more or less ob- 
vious from the nature of the specific case. However, when 
all of the factors just mentioned have been accounted for 
or where no detrimental elements are present, some chil- 
dren will still be found below standard. The application 
of intelligence tests reveals the fact that many in this 
group are in some degree below normal. 
Levels of Intelligence—The making and giving of in- 
telligence tests or general-ability tests has contributed 
much to a better understanding on the part of teachers 
and parents of the nature of intelligence and its distribu- 
tion. The terms ‘‘genius,’’ ‘‘average intelligence,’’ and 
“‘feeble-mindedness’? are understood by the average 
citizen, but have unfortunately contributed to the idea 
that intelligence is distributed in rather well defined 
levels, each clearly distinct from the other. As a matter 
of fact, intelligence shows an infinite gradation from the 
lowest idiocy to the most brilliant genius. A given indi- 
vidual can be located at any spot along this scale. It is 
extremely difficult to differentiate between some classes, 
for instance, the remarkably dull normal person from the 
unusually high-grade moron. The line cannot be drawn 
in border-line cases, and there are many variations within 
the group that can be distinguished as normal. In fact, 
there seems to be no limit to the number of variations 
along the scale. Just where a pupil falls in this intelli- 
gence scale is a matter of vital importance to those con- 
cerned with training him for life. Many of the intelli- 
gence levels are quite unfitted for some types of school 
work but can do other things remarkably well. The vari- 
ations in this respect are limited only by the variations 
in the intelligence scale referred to above. 
   
-P-A-G-E-324
304 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
The results of intelligence tests are given in terms of the 
following table,® which is a standardized classification: 
‘Above 140 “Near” genius or genius. 
120-140......Very superior intelligence. 
110-120...... Superior intelligence. 
90-110......Normal, or average intelligence. 
80-90......Dullness, rarely classifiable as feeble-mindedness. 
Border-line deficiency, sometimes classifiable as 
dullness, often as feeble-mindedness. 
Below 70......Definite feeble-mindedness. 
  _ The number given each pupil is known as his intelli- 
gence quotient (I. Q.). Most of the well known intelli- 
gence tests reduce their point scores to the terms of the 
above table. The Illinois Examination, a recent addition 
to the field, makes some qualifications of the table, but 
they are fully explained in the handbook for that test. 
Many studies have been carried on to determine the rela- 
tion of a given I. Q. to ability to do school work. The 
supervisor should keep in touch with such studies by 
means of the periodical literature. 
Another index of intelligence is the mental age (M. A.), 
expressed in terms of years and months, which shows 
mental maturity without regard to years lived, or chron- 
ological age. The Binet-Simon test, referred to above, 
gives its results directly in this form. Other tests furnish 
rules by which the point score can be reduced to mental 
age. Where mental age and chronological age are both 
known, the I. Q. can be obtained by division, since the 
I. Q. is the per cent that mental age is of chronological 
age. 
The statistics underlying the determination of these 
terms and the translation of point scores are often quite 
complicated but they need not concern the supervisor, 
°L. M. Terman, The Measurement of Intelligence, Boston 1916,

-P-A-G-E-325
  THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 305 
because, as stated above, tables or simple formulas are fur- 
nished with the tests. 
Caution must be exercised in dealing with cases in the 
borderline group, or with cases at the extreme limits of 
any group, but with proper attention to other important 
factors, the intelligence ratings can be used as partial 
determinants of a pupil’s ability and fitness. Mental age 
indicates the school grade in which a child belongs, while 
I. Q. indicates his ability to do rapid, average, or slow 
work. 
Characteristics of Different Intelligence Levels—The 
following quotations from Terman, one of the recognized 
experts in the field, sum up very briefly the salient points 
here: 7° 
The more we learn about, [subnormal] children, the clearer it 
becomes that they must be looked upon as real defectives. They 
may be able to drag along to the fourth, fifth, or sixth grades, but 
even by the age of 16 or 18 years they are never able to cope 
successfully with the more abstract and difficult part of the com- 
mon-school course of study. They may master a certain amount 
of rote learning, such as that involved in reading and in the 
manipulation of number combinations, but they cannot be taught 
to meet new conditions effectively or to think, reason, and judge as 
normal persons do. 
Psychological tests show that children of superior ability are 
very likely to be misunderstood in school. The writer has tested 
more than a hundred children who were as much above average 
intelligence as moron defectives are below. The large majority 
of these were found located below the school grade warranted by 
their intellectual level. One-third had failed to reap any ad- 
vantage whatever, in terms of promotion, from their very superior 
intelligence. Even genius languishes when kept over-long at tasks 
that are too easy. 
Our data show that teachers sometimes fail entirely to recog- 
nize exceptional superiority in a pupil, and that the degree of 
superiority is rarely estimated with anything like the accuracy

which is possible to the psychologist after a one-hour examination. 
. .. [Paragraph of interesting data concerning individual cases.] 
. .. [A student] was doing superior work in the sixth grade, but 
according to the testimony of the teacher, had “no unusual 
ability.” It was ascertained from the parents that this boy, at an 
age when most children are reading fairy stories, had a passion 
for standard medical literature and textbooks in physical science. 
Yet, after more than a year of daily contact with this young 
genius (who is a relative of Meyerbeer, the composer), the teacher 
had discovered no symptoms of unusual ability. 
Teachers should be better trained in detecting the signs of 
superior ability. Every child who consistently gets high marks in 
his school work with apparent ease should be given a mental 
examination, and if his intelligence level warrants it he should 
either be given extra promotions, or placed in a special class for 
superior children where faster progress can be made. The latter 
is the better plan, because it obviates the necessity of skipping 
grades; it permits rapid but continuous progress. 
The usual reluctance of teachers to give extra promotions prob- 
ably rests upon three factors: (1) mere inertia; (2) a natural 
unwillingness to part with exceptionally satisfactory pupils; and 
(3) the traditional belief that precocious children should be held 
back for fear of dire physical or mental consequences. 
In order to throw light on the question whether exceptionally 
bright children are specially likely to be one-sided, nervous, deli- 
eate, morally abnormal, socially unadaptable, or otherwise peculiar, 
the writer has secured rather extensive information regarding 31 
children whose mental age was found by intelligence tests to be 
25 per cent above the actual age.... [Page of data regarding 
these pupils.] 
According to the above data, exceptionally intelligent children 
are fully as likely to be as healthy as ordinary children; their 
ability is far more often general than special, they are studious 
above the average, really serious faults are not common among 
them, they are nearly always socially adaptable, are sought by 
their playmates and companions, their play life is usually normal, 
they are leaders far oftener than other children, and, notwith- 
standing their many really superior qualities, they are seldom 
vain or spoiled. 
It would be greatly to the advantage of such children if their 
superior ability were more promptly and fully recognized, and if 
(under proper medical supervision, of course) they were pro-

moted as rapidly as their mental development would warrant. 
Unless they are given the grade of work which calls forth their 
best efforts, they run the risk of falling into lifelong habits of sub- 
maximum efficiency. The danger in the case of such children is 
not over-pressure, but under-pressure. 
These quotations point out the places of emphasis in this 
matter. The pupil must be examined carefully and then 
pedagogical procedure and administrative mechanism 
should be adapted as far as reasonably possible to care for 
him. A vast amount of pertinent information, in easily 
understood terms, will be found in Terman’s two books, 
The Measurement of Intelligence and The Intelligence of 
School Children. The supervisor should be familiar with 
these and other books on the topic and he should also keep 
up with current periodical literature, which contains many 
valuable articles, 
Summary of the Uses of Intelligence Tests.—The chief 
use of these tests is, as has just been shown, the investiga- 
tion of pupils who fall well below or well above the ac- 
cepted standard for age and grade. The placing of slow 
or dull children where they can be happier with work 
within their ability to accomplish and bringing to the 
bright pupil the opportunity to utilize his additional 
mental power are probably the most important contribu- 
tions the tests will make to the betterment of instruction. 
Other services in regard to economy of time, more efficient 
training, and better grouping are also incidental here. 
A second use of intelligence tests, closely akin to the 
one just cited, is in the placing of new pupils entering 
from other school systems. The time-honored plan of 
penalizing the newcomer a grade or half-grade is with- 
out rhyme or reason. The mental age has been found 
by experiment to be a safer guide in placing such 
pupils. Related to this use of the tests is their use in 
determining fitness to enter school. The usual age is six,
-P-A-G-E-328
  308 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
put tests show that many are capable of entering at five, 
while others should be kept out until seven. 
A third use can be found in the field of vocational 
guidance. Many valuable studies have been made, but 
because of the complexity of the problem, the results 
must be used with caution. However, some facts are be- 
coming rather well established in regard to the I. Q. 
necessary for some trades and professions. The public- 
school supervisor will probably not be concerned with 
this field for some time to come but should be reasonably 
familiar with the possibilities and the best experiments. 
A fourth use, which will also lie beyond the province 
of the average supervisor at present, but which should 
involve those in the larger city systems, is in studying the 
factors that influence mental development, the inher- 
itance of intelligence, ete. 
Kinds of Intelligence Tests.—These tests are of two 
kinds, those designed for testing individuals, one at a time, 
and those designed to test large groups at one sitting. 
Individual Tests—The pioneer intelligence test is the 
now famous Binet-Simon scale. There have been numerous 
revisions of it, the Stanford Revision being probably the 
best known. This test is arranged to include a series of 
questions for each age from three up to fifteen, eleven and 
thirteen excepted. There are, in addition, tests for average 
and superior adults. The subject is asked to answer the 
questions or perform certain tasks. Giving the test and 
scoring the answers has been reduced to a routine, which, 
it is claimed, any competent teacher can follow. For rough 
testing the teacher can probably be intrusted with the work 
after brief training. In important and difficult cases the 
supervisor should do it himself unless teachers with con- 
siderable training and experience are available. The great- 
est care should be exercised at all times in giving and inter- 
preting the tests. The explicit directions and full explana-
-P-A-G-E-329
      THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 309 
tion of possible answers contained in Terman’s The Meas- 
urement of Intelligence should be mastered by the super- 
visor. 
In training teachers to give these tests, the supervisor 
should acquaint them with the origin and development of 
intelligence examinations in order that the teacher may 
explain intelligently to parents what is being done when 
explanations are demanded. It is sometimes difficult to 
convince the average citizen, even the better educated 
group, that intelligence can be measured or at least indi- 
eated in relative terms. A great number of criticisms 
and objections will be met and should be answered by, 
citing experimental results or sound psychological theory. 
Group Tests —The use of intelligence tests in the Army 
made prominent the need for handling large numbers of 
subjects at once, and there have been worked out a num- 
ber of group intelligence tests. In school these group 
tests should probably be applied first, and followed by 
individual testing and investigation of those cases which 
differ markedly from the normal. There are quite a num- 
ber of such tests on the market at present. Most of them 
give evidence of hurried preparation and lack of original- 
ity, and though they have been fairly well standardized in 
terms of the I. Q. table, they are in no way as reliable 
as the individual scale just discussed. Studies are at pres- 
ent under way in which the comparative value of the dif- 
ferent tests is under examination, and some of them are 
shown to be very erratic. They should be used carefully 
and only in conjunction with other investigations of 
pupils’ abilities. Some valuable studies are available 
showing the correlation of Binet-Simon score, group-test 
scores, and school grade, which will aid the supervisor 
materially in his examination of individual pupils. 
Best known among these tests are probably the Otis 
Group Intelligence Test, the Army Examination (several 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
rms), Haggerty’s Virginia Delta I and Virginia Delta 
yII. Thorndike, Dearborn, Whipple, and Thurstone, all 
have published group tests that are widely used. There 
are many others also, less well known. 
A departure in this field is embodied in the Illinois Ex- 
amination, issued by the Bureau of Educational Research, 
University of Illinois. This test includes both educational 
measurement and intelligence test in the same examination. 
Limitations of Intelligence Tests—There is a tendency 
in some quarters to base everything on intelligence tests. 
This is probably not wise since they have definite limita- 
tions that should be thoroughly understood. The emotional 
side of the individual is not investigated in any way nor 
is special talent discovered. The I. Q. is a fair index of 
what a student can do but not of what he will do. Fur- 
thermore, while it locates the child in a general way the 
test is not a pedagogical guide. It must be supplemented 
by other tests and personal investigations, which will all 
aid in determining the pedagogical procedure. For a scien- 
tific discussion of the foregoing general statements the su- 
pervisor is referred to a study made jointly by Breed and 
Bresslich and reported in the January and March, 1922, 
issues of the School Review. The conclusions are based 
upon carefully measured evidence and indicate how intel- 
ligence tests may be used. The limitations are pointed out, 
and it is shown that school achievement is affected in 
marked degree by the factors other than intelligence. 
_ Despite the limitations, however, the best tests, when used 
with care and discrimination, especially the Binet-Simon 
seale, are very material aids to the supervisor. 
Statistics and Tabulation—The intelligence tests in- 
volve the same statistics and graphic representations as 
do the educational measurements. The giving, scoring, 
and interpreting of group scales is much easier than in the 
ease of either individual scales or educational measure- 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 311 
ments. Explicit directions accompany the tests in the 
teacher’s manual. They can be given by any careful per- 
son and can be scored by clerks or students. 
THe Revation Between EpucationaL MEASUREMENTS 
AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
A new departure in the field of testing and measuring 
is embodied in the Illinois Examination I and II, issued 
by the Bureau of Educational Research, University of 
Illinois. This test includes an intelligence examination 
and two subject-matter tests, Monroe’s Standardized 
Silent Reading Test and Monroe’s General Survey Scale 
in Arithmetic. 
The unique feature of this examination is not, however, 
the mere placing of the two types of test in a single book- 
let but the way in which the measures of achievement are 
combined with the measure for intelligence. The usual 
procedure of interpreting achievement by reference to 
grade norms provides for no consideration of the general 
intelligence of the pupil; all pupils, bright, average, and 
dull, are judged with reference to the same norms. For 
example, three pupils in the fifth grade and of approx- 
imately the same chronological age might differ from one 
to three years in mental age, but they would all be judged 
by the same grade norm in reading or arithmetic. First, 
it is obviously unfair to expect three pupils of differing 
mental maturity to approximate the same standard score. 
Secondly, it is equally obvious that if they did approxi- 
mate it, the result is not an accurate interpretation of the 
situation at all. The Illinois Examination makes its 
unique contribution at this point, providing a procedure 
by which a pupil’s achievement can be interpreted in 
terms of his general intelligence, capacity to learn, or 
mental maturity. 
   
-P-A-G-E-332
    312 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
In order to do this, mental-age norms were established 
for the educational tests, in place of the usual grade 
norms. That is, the point score that a pupil should attain 
in the two Monroe tests mentioned above is determined 
for this examination in levels corresponding to mental 
ages, rather than in levels corresponding to school grade 
or chronological age. These norms were scientifically 
determined by giving the tests and the intelligence exam- 
ination to some fifty thousand children. 
As soon as a pupil’s point score is determined, his 
achievement age (A. A.) can be determined by reference 
to a table supplied in the examination handbook. For 
instance, if a pupil attains a reading-rate score of 148, the 
table shows that his achievement age is 11 years. If his 
mental age is also 11 years, he has then achieved as well 
as the average of all pupils of his mental age. Should his 
mental age, however, be 12 years, his score of 148 is 12 
points short of the proper rate score (160) for his age, and 
he has achieved less well than the average of pupils of his 
mental age. On the other hand, if his mental age is ten, 
he has then achieved 15 points better than the proper rate 
score (133) for his age. This relation between the pupil’s 
achievement age and his mental age, that is, between his 
actual and his possible achievement, is expressed by 
the achievement quotient (A. Q.). This figure is obtained 
by dividing A. A. by M. A., or by consulting the detailed 
table supplied with the tests. The following brief para- 
graph from the handbook ** will illustrate: 
For instance, if a pupil has an achievement age of 12 years and 
a mental age of 9 years, his achievement quotient is 133. (Decimal 
point omitted as in the intelligence quotient.) If this pupil’s 
mental age had been 14 years, his achievement quotient would 
have been 86. An achievement quotient of 100 means that the

Teachers Handbook, 1920, p. 17.
-P-A-G-E-333
  THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 313 
pupil has achieved exactly as well as the average of pupils of his 
mental age. If his achievement quotient is 130, it means that he 
has achieved thirty per cent more than the average of the pupils 
of his mental age; on the other hand, if his achievement quotient 
is 75, we have evidence that he has achieved only seventy-five per 
cent as much as the average of pupils of his mental age. 
The following table has been proposed to indicate the 
per cent of pupils that can reasonably be expected to 
attain certain A. Q.’s.? 
Quality of Pupil’s Achievement Per Cent of 
Achievement Quotient Pupils Included 
(135-164 
   Through the achievement quotient it may be discovered 
how far the school and other educative influences are en- 
abling pupils to realize upon their intelligence. Of course, 
it is recognized that there are extra-intelligence and 
extra-educational factors involved as well in achievement. 
However this may be, any supervisor or teacher who finds 
a pupil below 100 A. Q. is thereby notified that for some 
reason or other the pupil is not realizing upon his full 
intelligence. 
The extra-intellectual factors referred to have to do 
with the amount, direction, and persistence of effort. 
They are emotional and volitional and have so far defied 
efforts to measure them. It may be noted in passing that 
Dr. June Downey, University of Wyoming, has done some 
remarkable work along the line of determining the nature 
of the volitional elements in an individual’s make-up, and

    314 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
her results may in time be adapted to diagnosis of pupil 
activity. | 
It will be seen that the A. Q. supplements in some meas- 
ute the I. Q. as a basis for planning pupil placement or 
remedial measures. The latter term leaves the extra- 
intellectual factors largely out of account, and while the 
A. Q. cannot in any way measure them, it does, in so far 
as it is constant, indicate that there are other factors that 
enable the pupil to make more than his intelligence would 
normally warrant or that are hindering him from making as 
much as his intelligence warrants. 
The Comparison of Grades or Schools.—This examina- 
tion and its unique feature, the achievement quotient, is 
not only valuable in the matter of individual differences 
but is of use also in the comparison of groups. Monroe ** 
cites the case of two cities, A and B, in which B was 
shown to be somewhat superior in arithmetic and con- 
siderably superior in reading. However, when the mental 
ages of the pupils were taken into account and the 
achievement quotients figured, it was found that city A 
was undoubtedly superior in that it was achieving con. 
siderably more in terms of pupil potentiality than was 
city B. By the usual method of comparing grade norms 
without much other inquiry a quite erroneous judgment 
was made. It can be seen that the further extension of 
this idea of measuring in terms of the capacity of the 
pupil will not only make for much more accurate diag- 
nosis and judgment but for considerably better work by 
individual pupils and teachers. It might well be applied 
to normal school and college students, and those individ- 
uals excluded who do not realize on their potential 
ability. 
The vital importance of this whole matter of actual and 
3 W. S. Monroe, loc. cit., p. 27,
-P-A-G-E-335
  THE USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 315 
possible achievement, of utilizing to the fullest a pupil’s 
potentiality, and of securing accurate measures of what 
is actually taking place, is made very concrete in the fol- 
lowing figures, quoted from Pintner of Teachers College.** 
A study of 4,215 cases shows that bright children are much more 
likely to be educationally retarded than dull ones, if we take into 
account their mental ability. ° 
Of 900 cases showing a marked inability in school attainment 
in comparison with their mental ability, 47 per cent were classified 
as mentally bright, whereas only 8 per cent were classified as 
mentally backward or dull. On the other hand, of the children 
who were accomplishing more than is ordinarily accomplished 
by children of like mentality, we find only 11 per cent belonging 
to the mentally superior group, and 40 per cent belonging to the 
mentally slow group. 
Reliability of the Ilinois Examination.—Since this is a 
pioneer test. in its field it is subject to the limitations of 
any pioneer attempt ‘The intelligence test has a probable 
error of about six months, which is about the same as that 
found in the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon scale, 
which is regarded as a highly reliable instrument. The 
scores in reading and arithmetic are subject to some slight 
unreliability, which may be increased when all scores are 
eombined. The authors are two of the most careful 
workers in the field, Dr. B. R. Buckingham and Dr. W. 8. 
Monroe, and they have made a thorough study of this 
aspect of the matter and present their results in their 
handbook. All in all, the examination is probably as free 
from error as any other devised and standardized by 
scientific workers, and it is already being recommended by 
some experts in the field as the best single instrument for 
measuring now in use. 
This extended discussion of one test is given because it is 
a new departure and its contribution is marked and vital.

316 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
SuMMary FoR THE SUPERVISOR 
The supervisor must be able to give many of the standard 
educational measurement tests and intelligence tests and 
to instruct teachers concerning their values and uses. A 
number of teachers should be trained under his direction | 
to give and interpret several tests and gradually this work 
may be extended for some tests to all teachers. In the case 
of practice tests and examinations in the formal subjects, 
teachers should probably be trained to use them as routine 
parts of the work. 
The supervisor should be able to make the more complex 
tabulations and computations which teachers as a rule need 
not learn. He should be able to codrdinate the different 
studies within his district, to report to his group the useful 
results of other studies, to determine if the derivation and 
standardization of a test is sufficient and scientific. 
In addition to aiding the teacher to adapt her teaching to 
the situations revealed by the tests, the supervisor must also 
arrange and operate administrative devices, such as irreg- 
ular promotion, subject promotion, class divisions, special 
rooms for advanced or retarded pupils, etc. Much of the 
discussion in the section on Individual Differences in Chap- 
ter IV applies here.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 
A series of difficult and complicated problems will con- 
front the supervisor in this field, the general improvement 
of teachers while in service. In many places this work is 
well organized and much real benefit is being derived by 
teachers. In other places, however, there is manifested a 
lack of interest in the problems involved that results in 
the whole matter being slighted. This is all the more 
regrettable in view of the fact that there is a rather well 
organized literature of theory, practice, and results, to- 
gether with many easily adaptable mechanisms, already 
in existence for improving the knowledge and skill of 
teachers. 
Shall Improvement Work Be Required of Teachers or 
Be Voluntary?—One group of difficulties centers around 
the foregoing question. The best results will come, of 
course, from voluntary work, but those who need it most 
will probably fail to receive benefit unless there is some re- 
quirement laid down. In practically every state in the 
Union some phase or other of improvement work is re- 
quired. The number and kinds of requirements is stead- 
ily growing. Some of these requirements are embodied 
in state certificate laws, others in county standards, 
others in the by-laws and teacher contracts of boards of 
education in large cities. Many teachers codperate enthusi- 
astically with such requirements, but there is a large group 
the members of which object, sometimes loudly and strenu- 
ously, to any and all requirements that take their time 
320
-P-A-G-E-341
   
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 321 
for meetings, lectures, correspondence or summer-school 
courses, ete. 
Objections to Required Work.—Objectors can be divided 
roughly into three groups. First are those who would be 
glad to profit by meetings, lectures, or courses but who are 
disgusted by the poor presentation of poor material. Part 
of the same group object to attending meetings that are 
adapted to only a part of the group present. Obviously, 
primary teachers are wasting their time at a meeting 
devoted to upper-grade methods and discipline, no matter 
how good the material and presentation may be. 
A second group of objectors is made up of those 
teachers of fair training and some experience who feel 
that they are good, or even strong, teachers and who 
resent any suggestion that their education, general or 
special, be carried any further. This group will give the 
supervisor real problems because many of the individuals 
in it are really fair teachers and are sincere in their belief 
that their teaching and preparation are satisfactory. Their 
education has been good but narrow and has not intro- 
duced them to the vast reaches of information, to the 
intricate niceties of artistic teaching, of which they are 
totally ignorant. With the utmost tact the supervisor 
should bring them in contact with expert teachers, good 
lecturers, new fields of information, in the hope that they 
will see the light. Many of them can be interested, in- 
spired, and won over to study and experimentation. 
The third group is made up of that minority of teachers 
found everywhere who are not interested in teaching and 
do not care that they are not. They begin work when the 
bell rings, drop it at the first opportunity, and are proud 
of the fact that they do not think of their pupils between 
sessions. They make every effort to conceal the fact that 
they are teachers. This group, a minority, it is true, but 
a constant one, scoffs at and objects violently to any out- 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
  322 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
side work of any nature. The only treatment available _ 
is to eliminate such teachers from the system at the first 
opportunity. 
Meeting the Objections—An examination of the objec- 
tions very briefly outlined above shows some of them to 
be legitimate and also gives valuable suggestions for 
organizing and administering the work. Most of the 
legitimate objections would seem to disappear if there is 
made a proper application of the principle of individual 
differences. Improvement work should not be required 
indiscriminately of all teachers alike. Teachers differ as 
pupils do, in native ability, in special interests, in training, 
in present and possible financial conditions. Such factors 
should be taken into consideration in planning and or- 
ganzing improvement work. 
Roughly and in general, it is fair to say that the normal 
graduate is able to organize lessons and to find an average 
amount of subject matter. In the application, somewhat 
formally, it is true, of special devices she is also fairly pro- 
ficient. But in the technique of the drill lesson, in aiding 
pupils to study, in finding supplementary subject matter, 
in discipline, the normal graduate often needs definite 
help such as can be given through one or other of the 
devices for training in service. These younger teachers 
are somewhat familiar with new departures in education 
and are usually open-minded. The problem of aiding 
them is not difficult, being one of determining the specific 
need and directing the individual to the proper series of 
meetings, the proper reading-circle work or summer-school 
course. 
On the other hand, the expert teacher of excellent train- 
ing and long experience should not be insulted by being 
directed to attend meetings and follow reading courses 
adapted to the young normal graduate. ‘A waste of time 
and a personal irritation are involved that are unnecessary.   
     
-P-A-G-E-343
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 323 
This teacher should be directed to those phases of training 
which will broaden her already good general education and 
which will so increase her professional knowledge and skill 
as to fit her for supervisory or administrative positions. 
Some there are who say that this is an unfair motive to 
give the teacher because there are not enough higher posi- 
tions to take care of those who would take the higher 
training. Such an objection is based upon an ignorance 
of the fact that there is a real and tremendous shortage of 
trained experts in all phases of school work and related 
social service. 
The great number of teachers who fall between the two 
extremes just discussed will also be helped in terms of 
their individual needs. Let it be emphasized most strongly 
that there is no teacher at present nor will there be for a 
long time in America any teacher who is so expert and so 
well trained that she cannot profit by some of the lines of 
training to be discussed below. As has been said, those 
who feel sincerely that they are satisfactorily trained 
already will necessitate the most careful and tactful 
handling by the supervisor. He should exert every effort 
to bring these teachers to a realization of their need for 
training. Teachers who are of fair ability but who do not 
progress must understand that they cannot expect ad- 
vance in rank or salary. Those who begin to show a 
tendency to drop back must be required to take additional 
training and show the benefits of it or they must be elim- 
inated. 
As has been stated, some phases of this work are 
required practically everywhere. However, the super- 
visor will get much better results by so administering it as 
to invite voluntary codperation first, reserving the club 
of requirement for the last resort in extreme cases. The 
adaptation to individual differences discussed above is a 
valuable device in securing codperation. The time element 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  324 SUPERVISION. AND TEACHING 
should be taken into consideration and teachers excused 
from other duties or allowance of some kind made for the 
extra work. In some places the merit system of promo- 
tion is used and ineludes, as one element, additional prep- 
aration. Though there are some important drawbacks te 
the merit system, it is worthy of a trial. A salary bonus 
or expense money is often given for summer-school work. 
In some cases teachers who have shown themselves un- 
usually proficient and who have taken advanced work in 
administration and supervision can be given a voice in 
determining policy. The personality of the supervisor, 
the kind of lecturers or group leaders secured, the type 
and diversity of work available are all important features 
in attracting teachers to outside work and in overcoming 
their objections to it. 
Partial List of Activities Involved._The opportunities 
for training teachers in service vary widely. The com- 
monest means are probably teachers’ meetings of various 
kinds, summer schools in connection with normal schools 
and colleges, and extension courses. In addition there 
are the less elaborate devices, reading circles, professional 
magazines, the circulation of local bulletins, lyceums, 
intervisitation, demonstration teaching, social gatherings, 
ete. 
A Teachers’ Meetings.—Teachers’ meetings are of various 
kinds and can be grouped roughly as follows: (1) general 
faculty meetings attended by all teachers in a building or 
district; (2) intergrade meetings attended by the teachers 
of two or three adjacent grades; (3) grade meetings 
attended by the teachers working in one grade only 
(meetings attended by teachers of a special subject or of 
a regular subject in a departmentalized school would be 
of this type also); (4) conventions or associations. 
Gatherings designated as committee meetings are suffi- 
ciently like grade or intergrade meetings to be classed 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 325 
with them. They may involve but a few teachers in some 
eases. 
Organization and Administration of Meetings.—If great 
eare and the best thought is not exercised in administering 
these meetings, they will not only fail of their purpose but 
will engender a bad attitude toward them on the part of . 
teachers. The following points should be taken into ac- 
count in organizing any meeting, large or small. (1) The 
topic should be a live one, with which the group involved 
is vitally concerned. A list of topics will be given a few 
pages further on. (2) A mimeographed brief should be 
mailed out in advance to those who will be present. This 
may consist of an outline of what is going to be done or it 
may be a set of theses that will be defended by the speaker. 
This item is absolutely necessary if any thoughtful reaction 
is to be made by the audience. (3) Provision should be 
made for the expression of opinion from the audience. 
Teachers have a right to ask questions and of necessity 
must ask them if they are to profit by the meetings. They 
ean also supply valuable illustrations, not to mention 
additional arguments for or against the view of the speaker. 
(4) The meeting should be in charge of a supervisor or out- 
side speaker who is not only expert in the subject under 
discussion but who also has the gift of popular exposition. 
Many men of undoubted scholarship are unable to make 
intelligible presentations to an audience, while others who 
have no patience for research are admirably fitted to ex- 
plain clearly what the scholar has discovered. (5) The 
meeting must be thoroughly planned and administered. It 
must not be allowed to degenerate into pointless, boresome 
discussion. Neither the speaker on the platform nor one 
from the audience has the right to make long digressions or 
to raise irrelevant questions. This fault is one of the com- 
monest complained of by teachers. (6) Meetings should 
not be used for routine purposes that can be disposed of
-P-A-G-E-346
    326 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
otherwise. This point deserves double emphasis. Super- 
visors manifest a crude disregard for teachers’ rights and 
a lack of appreciation of time value when they summon a - 
great number of people together merely to hand them a 
course of study or a copy of anewrule. The mail will do this 
service much more expeditiously. (7) Teachers’ meetings 
should not be held after school, when time is short and 
everyone is tired. As a rule, also, Monday and Friday 
should be avoided. School may be dismissed early or an 
occasional evening may be taken. Other points will prob- 
ably be added to this list by supervisors as they meet the 
actual problems involved in holding such meetings. 
The Institute——The supervisor will probably have little 
opportunity to aid in organizing teachers’ associations 
and conventions, with the exception of the type known as 
the institute. The institute is held with few exceptions 
in every county in every state in the country and is, in 
consequence, the best known professional meeting. At- 
tendance is compulsory, which means that practically 
every teacher is reached. Much good is undoubtedly 
accomplished but it must be admitted that a remarkably 
large number of teachers dislike and abuse the institute. 
Some administrative officers refuse to admit that this con- 
dition exists but unbiased examination will quickly dem- 
onstrate that it does. In view of the universality of the 
institute, its great opportunity for benefit, the manifest 
dislike and objection voiced by many teachers, this device 
for improving teachers in service should be carefully seru- 
tinized. 
My own introduction to institutes, if I may use the first 
person for a few paragraphs, came long before I thought 
of teaching. As a reporter, I was assigned to cover a big 
county institute held for the first time in our town instead 
of at the county seat. Knowing several of the school 
people intimately, I approached the meeting in a most
-P-A-G-E-347
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 327 
favorable attitude, ready to give it very favorable pub- 
licity. The first setback came when none of my. friends 
among the officials could give me a definite, intelligible 
statement as to what an institute was. The statements as 
to why they were held, other than the legal requirement, 
were equally vague and incoherent. Being totally, 
ignorant of school affairs, I attributed the difficulty to my, 
own lack of understanding. Thinking to get my own 
ideas as the meetings proceeded, I went in and sat down. 
A rural glee club entered and, with the expressions of 
pallbearers, sang lilting songs of the springtime. This 
seemed peculiar. Without any preliminary announce- 
ment a man appeared on the stage with a textbook in his 
hand. He waved the book in the air and fluttered the 
pages much as he attempted to explain that this new text 
in primary arithmetic was, as near as I could make out, 
a menace to the morals of the community, a violation of 
the Monroe Doctrine, and an insult to the founders of 
American democracy. He was followed by a college pro- 
fessor who spoke for an hour on the merits of the ‘‘seven 
liberal arts.’’ The few teachers awake at the conclusion 
applauded weakly and everyone went to lunch. In the 
afternoon I went from room to room, watching old-time 
teachers explain teaching and disciplinary devices to a 
lot of sleepy and inattentive people. I thought that prob- 
ably to-morrow the institute would really begin, but I was 
young and ignorant. Before the second day was over I 
began to formulate my own ideas as to the nature and 
purpose of institutes, but they were evidently wide of the 
mark, judging from the reception given my written ac- 
counts. The last day my, paper printed an account of a 
mythical educational convention supposed to be in session 
in a near-by town. The story departed but very little from 
the bare facts in order to become a highly humorous and 
decidedly derisive account of the local meeting. The

        328 
teachers read the account with great glee, but it was a 
long time until diplomatic relations were reéstablished 
with the county superintendent. I was completely igno- 
rant of pedagogy and psychology, but I had had several 
years’ experience covering public meetings and reporting 
public speakers of various kinds. I thought then and I 
know now that no single individual who appeared before 
that institute was competent to do so. Without exception, 
every single speaker lacked both the information on his 
subject and the speaking ability to make a simple, co- 
herent, intelligible presentation. I knew also that the 
audience was bored and disgusted to the limit. I knew 
that the whole affair was a costly waste of money and 
time, stupidly organized, and unintelligently adminis- 
tered. 
This is, of course, an extreme case, but institutes I 
attended later as a high-school teacher were only better 
here and there, not as a whole. None, however, equaled 
the gross inefficiency of the first. For some years I have- 
asked the experienced teachers in my normal school and 
eollege classes how they regard institutes and what bene- 
fits they receive from them. The answers group roughly 
into three classes. As a rule, the inadequately trained 
teacher, the high-school graduate, and the young normal 
graduate can all cite specific cases of assistance and help, 
but even these young people all make pointed and intelli- 
gent suggestions for bettering the meetings. The second 
group is made up of teachers of fair or good training and 
ability who state that they enjoy the good times and some 
of the social affairs but that only an occasional speaker 
is worth hearing. They also make good suggestions for 
betterment. The third group is that minority, drawing 
too often from the ranks of city teachers, who see no good 
in attending and who avoid attendance upon any excuse 
that will be accepted. This group is indifferent and pre
-P-A-G-E-349
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 329 
fers to abolish rather than to improve professional meet- 
ings. 
This evidence is limited in weight, of course, since it 
is drawn from one section of the country. The follow- 
ing quotations, however, seem to show that something of 
the same conditions prevail elsewhere. Says Reudiger:+ 
If these arraignments of institutes were isolated examples, they 
might be passed by unnoticed, but of late years expressions of a 
similar nature have become sufficiently frequent to arrest atten- 
tion. The feeling is beginning to spread that institutes have 
served their usefulness and should be discontinued. 
It is no doubt true that institutes, as they are still usually con- 
ducted, are an anachronism. They arose in the second quarter 
of the nineteenth century, before the normal schools had made 
much headway and when summer schools for teachers were un- 
known, to supply a distinct need in the training of teachers. Their 
sessions at that time were seldom less than two weeks in length, 
and often considerably longer, and they were conducted some- 
what on the plan of schools in which all the teachers took an active 
part. The teachers, according to Horace Mann, “formed them- 
selves into classes in all the branches they expected to teach; they 
studied lessons and performed recitations just as is done in 
school.” 
Another writer in much the same vein: ? 
The fact is that the institute as we have it at present, is a fossil. 
Its life history belongs to a time when conditions were different 
from the present . . . There is scarcely anything less pedagogical 
than the work of the ordinary institute. . . . Lecturers violate 
nearly all canons of modern education ... the while talking 
glibly about these same principles. . .. A second violation... 
namely the haphazard material usually presented . . . teachers 
take up work on which they have made no preparation . . . has 
no definite relations to work they are doing, and on which they 
can have no questions. 
It is well for all concerned to be aware of some of the 
  
1United States Bureau of Education, Bulletin No. 3, 1911, p. 31. 
2 Tbid., p. 30.
-P-A-G-E-350
330 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
reasons why institutes are so favorably regarded in cer- 
tain quarters. Says Seerley:* 
There is no doubt that the institute system managed by specially 
competent people has been a benefit, but . . . The constant change 
of county superintendents, the introduction of new and inexperi- 
enced instructors, the rise and fall of State superintendents . . . 
has kept the institute system magnified and glorified from year 
to year. 
The actual results claimed . . . usually greatly over-estimated 
by those who conduct institutes. Their enthusiasm directs their 
judgment, they accept appearance as results ... assume work 
specially effective and positively permanent. They have no def- 
inite way of determining the facts, or to summarize teacher opin- 
ion, and the estimates made are often more or less visionary and 
unreliable. Those who follow the business of conducting these 
annual assemblies, whose vocation depends on the system and who 
are firm believers in the system, more because they do not know 
anything better to do, than because of its real efficiency or excel- 
lence, could hardly be supposed to be unprejudiced witnesses. 
Many of the quotations just given are of some years’ 
standing and do not now apply to all sections of the coun- 
try. But it must be recognized by teachers and adminis- 
trators that the strictures made do still apply in an 
innumerable number of cases. Much better types of 
institutes appear here and there, as the following state- 
ment from Strayer will show: * 
Institutes were once looked upon as places where teachers came 
to be entertained, or, possibly to be inspired. There was a time 
when the best institutes were conducted on the “pouring in” plan. 
A lecturer, or several lecturers, dispensed the truth, and teachers 
sat in their places, supposedly drinking deep draughts from these 
fountains of wisdom. It is strange that all of the theory of teach- 
ing which was dispensed did not suggest that the manner of con- 
ducting the institute was wrong. In our best institutes to-day 
teachers participate in discussion, study and recite from books, 
*Tbid., p. 31. 
“G. D. Strayer, Brief Course in the Teaching Process, New York, 
1913, p. 230.  
-P-A-G-E-351
THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 331 
undertake the revision or organization of courses of study in co- 
operation with their supervisors; in short, the institute has become 
a school for professional study. In such an institute, as in teach- 
ers’ meetings, those who come with real problems, anxious to get 
help, find the week or two all too short. A group of teachers 
anxious to grow professionally can, in most cases, secure the co- 
operation of supervisors in transforming an institute which is 
organized on the old basis. 
How May Institutes Be Bettered?—The first step in bet- 
tering these meetings is to gain a clear understanding of 
their history and purpose. Part of their history has been 
given in the first quotation above and the rest can be ob- 
tained by consulting the reference. Quoting Reudiger 
again: 5 
To rail against institutes in a general way does little good. 
What is needed is an adequate conception of their nature and 
function in the light of their origin, and with this information at 
hand it may be possible to infer something in regard to their 
destiny. The beginning of institutes and the displacement of 
teachers’ conventions by them are of interest in this connection 
because these data seem to give us the key to the ultimate out- 
come of institutes. 
The typical teachers’ institute at one and the same time serves 
(1) as a professional training school for teachers; (2) as a 
teachers’ meeting in which the appointed authorities acquaint the 
teachers with the educational policies of the State or county, and 
with what is new and inspiring in educational thought; and (3) 
as a teachers’ convention or association, whose purpose is largely 
social. If we are to gain an adequate conception of institutes 
and their function, we must treat these three aspects separately, 
and if institutes are ever to reach a stable footing, they must 
differentiate themselves into these three distinct institutions. This 
means, of course, that the traditional institute will disappear, at 
least in substance if not in name, and that it will be replaced by 
summer normals, by official county and district teachers’ meetings, 
and by voluntary county and district teachers’ associations. 
It is astonishing that this definite summary by a writer 
  
* United States Bureau of Education, on No. 3, 1911, p. 32. 
   
-P-A-G-E-352
332 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
of note has been in print for so many years and has re- 
ceived as little attention as it has. Here and there about 
the country the institutes are tending toward two- or 
three-week sessions in summer time, thus approximating 
the older teachers’ gatherings which they once displaced. 
The growth of voluntary teachers’ associations is gaining 
ground slowly and will doubtless make better progress 
each year. There is nothing unfair or undemocratic in 
a requirement that all teachers in a county attend summer 
school or do other work depending on the type of certifi- 
cate they hold and the experience they have had. Sucha 
requirement affecting each teacher every second or third 
summer, in some cases every summer, would largely do 
away with the necessity for the traditional institute. 
But since the traditional institute will be with us for 
many years the following suggestions may be of help. 
The list is not intended as final or complete. 
1. Recognize clearly the distinctly different functions of an 
institute. (Summary by Reudiger above will serve to illustrate 
this point.) 
2. Provide definitely and methodically for these different func- 
tions. Do not secure an indiscriminate group of speakers, set the 
date, gather the teachers, mix, and trust in Providence for results. 
3. Secure speakers of two distinct types. (a) Those who can 
present clearly and logically, as well as inspirationally, the rela- 
tion of the teacher to the issues of the day, the problems of the 
profession, ete. (b) Those who ean present concrete illustrations 
of pedagogical theory. These individuals must be artistic teach- 
ers and gifted with clear exposition. They must be able to 
answer questions and conduct discussions. 
In regard to the first type of speaker, remember that great 
scholars are not always great speakers. In regard to the second, 
that one who has been “a successful teacher for twenty-two years” 
is not necessarily a good expositor. They are often not even good 
teachers. 
4, Make definite and intelligent provision for the social side of 
the meeting. Codperate with the local Parent-Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, the Commercial Club, the Country Club, or the Automobile
-P-A-G-E-353
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 333 
Club if such organizations are there. In small towns this phase 
presents a real problem. Probably a good lecturer of the Chau= 
tauqua type on some non-professional subject should be provided 
for one or two talks. A dinner, party, reception, dance, or some 
kind of social gathering should be provided and real effort made 
to see that it is worth while. The usual “reception” held during 
the average institute is one of the best reasons for abolishing 
institutes. : 
5. Consult the teaching body in advance in regard to the 
speakers and topics. A questionnaire can be mimeographed and 
sent out early enough so that an institute can be organized in 
terms of the real needs of a majority of those who will be present. 
All problems cannot be considered, of course, but those mentioned 
oftenest can undoubtedly be included. I remember one convention 
of about two thousand members that was divided into ten depart- 
mental meetings for one afternoon. It was thought that the 
attendance would be about evenly distributed, but over eighteen 
hundred of the two thousand tried to attend one of the depart- 
mental sections. Undoubtedly this convention consulted in ad- 
vance would have asked for several speakers and demonstrations 
of the topic they tried to see. 
6. Get the reactions of the teachers afterwards. Do not 
gather the enthusiastic statements made in the presence of the 
speakers and often in the hearing of administrative officers 
responsible for the meeting. Ask for specific written statements 
to be attached to the next monthly report. These reports should 
inelude reasons for approving the general speakers, should cite 
specific applications from the special sections, and make definite 
criticisms and suggestions for next year. 
This somewhat extended treatment of institutes has 
been given because, as has been stated, they involve the 
expenditure of much time and money, they reach all 
teachers, and they should be made into effective instru- 
ments of teacher training or supplanted by better agen- 
cies. Supervisors will have a hand in organizing and 
administering these meetings and are thus given a golden 
opportunity to make them effective and economical means 
of attaining the desired ends. 
An unusually valuable article dealing with the institute, 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  334 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
which appeared too late to be summarized in this chapter, 
will be found in the Journal of Rural Education, October, 
1921: Georgina Lommen, ‘‘The Teachers’ Institute as an 
‘Agency for Training Teachers in Service.’’ 
Topics for Teachers’ Meetings.—The following discus- 
sion of material suitable for teachers’ meetings will be 
carried on in terms of the smaller faculty and grade meet- 
ings. The principles involved can be adapted easily to the 
larger gatherings. It should be reémphasized here that 
all suggestions are qualified by the principle of individual 
differences. Topics and demonstrations are to be pre- 
sented to those groups only that are interested in the par- 
ticular problem involved. 
Topics from the Field of Method.—This whole field, gen- 
eral and special, will be a prolific source of discussions. 
Many teachers still need clear discussions of general prin- 
ciples, and all can profit through the analysis of partic- 
ularly well organized and taught demonstration lessons. 
Clever drill devices can be illustrated and explained. The 
project method could well occupy a general group for a 
‘series of meetings. After several meetings devoted to a 
discussion of the underlying principles the faculty could 
be divided into sections in terms of major interest and 
take up those specific projects fitted to their work. 
Demonstration lessons involving actual subject matter 
from the course of study and presented by an expert are 
of real assistance. Such lessons afford members of the 
group the opportunity to participate in the programmes, 
either in teaching the lesson or in the free discussion 
afterwards. Outlines of the work to be presented should 
be sent to teachers in advance so that they may look for 
those bits of technique in which they are particularly 
interested, and also in order that they may make prepara- 
tion for intelligent questions. Special supervisors might 
very well take advantage of the opportunity to present 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 335 
work to groups and thus avoid the needless interruption 
of the daily programme with which they are often 
charged. It will also save them piecemeal presentation 
of work to half a dozen teachers one at a time under 
unfavorable conditions. 
The various outlines given at the close of chapters in 
this book will make good material for discussion 
groups. The theory of method can be discussed in terms 
of the outlines or they can be used in the analysis of dem- 
onstration lessons. 
Often beginning teachers, and not infrequently experi- 
enced teachers, are weak in lesson planning. The absolute 
necessity for planning, economical methods of doing it, 
and the benefits of it should be made clear. That kind of 
lesson planning should be emphasized which works pro- 
gressively toward a minimum of formal written planning 
and which gives the teacher the ability to plan lessons 
easily and psychologically. The outline given below will 
be found suggestive. 
The disadvantages and dangers of an elaborate and in- 
flexible system of planning should be pointed out. After 
lessons have been planned, the teacher should understand 
that the organization is not a rigid thing to be adhered to 
strictly. The purpose of planning is to organize material 
into teachable form and also to make sure that the teacher 
has been through the subject matter at least once from the 
teaching point of view. As facility is gained, plans will be 
reduced to a few notes on a card. Many teachers never 
make notes, but they have either acquired the ability to 
plan mentally or they are poor teachers. A supervisor will 
often ask to see a teacher’s plan. He has the right to 
require of any beginning or weak teacher fairly definite 
detailed plans open to his inspection at any time. Experi- 
enced teachers whose work is eminently satisfactory 
should not be required to keep such plan books. They can

  usually discuss any point the supervisor raises because the 
lesson plan is well in mind. 
Lzsson Puan OUTLINE 
I. Subject matter: 
A. The teacher’s aim: General: General topic being studied. 
Specific: Part involved in this lesson. 
B. What is to be taught? (Give here a list, outline, or brief 
of the subject matter for the lesson.) 
(a) Old knowledge: Material already known to 
pupils, and which will be used in introducing 
the aim or setting up the problem. 
(b) New knowledge: The material to be learned. 
C List sources and references used, both by teacher in prep- 
aration and those to which pupils will be referred. Note 
tools and materials that will be necessary and that must 
be ready for the lesson. 
IL. Method: 
Write out in some detail your procedure in teaching this 
lesson. Use the formal lesson steps where they are of 
help but disregard them if they interfere. Include both 
questions you will ask and the answers you expect. 
Make prominent the introduction of the pupil’s aim; 
show how you expect to provide for possible wrong 
answers likely to come up; how you will introduce new 
material, summarize, provide drill, stimulate thought; 
how you will make the assignment, ete. In short, indi- 
cate in this part of the lesson plan about what you 
expect to do and say while before the class. 
      
          
  Many systems of lesson planning provide for a two- 
column arrangement, subject matter on one side and 
method on the other. In print this may be very orderly 
and proper but most students find it a cumbersome 
method of writing plans. A good outline for projects is 
illustrated in the appendix. 
Topics Related to Subject Matter—Analysis of the 
course of study, with detailed explanations of problems 
raised, might well occupy a meeting or two for new teach- 
ers at the beginning of the year.

for school use are all sources of discussion. Just why 
teachers should be neglected in the matter of textbook 
selection is a mystery. Competent teachers, in close touch 
with the learner, and who can apply such standards as 
those outlined in Chapter XII, can be of material assist- 
ance to supervisors in this matter. Texts might be dis- 
tributed and time allowed for careful review, after which 
different opinions might be presented to the group. Not 
only is this a good method of textbook inspection but also 
a good method of determining a teacher’s ability to think. 
Open discussion should follow such presentations. 
The whole field of codperative curriculum building can 
be utilized in providing material for good meetings. 
Testing and Measuring Educational Results; Rating 
Teachers—The whole matter of tests and measurements 
should be thoroughly investigated by teachers. Several 
of the schemes outlined in Chapter XIII for training teach- 
ers in the use of these things involve meetings of various 
sorts. Many of the tests are unscientifically prepared, and 
a discussion of scientific method would be very valuable. 
Reports of experiments and investigations going on within 
the system or reported in the periodical literature should 
be presented. © 
The elements in teacher-rating scales should be made 
clear to all teachers. The people to whom the scales are 
to be applied should have an opportunity to question the 
validity or fairness of any point involved. Much of the 
dissatisfaction with teacher rating could be eliminated if 
there could be open discussion of the points involved, the 
necessity for rating, the uses of the cards, and the abuses’ 
and dangers of the proceeding. 
This very matter of improving teachers in service might 
well be discussed by the people being trained. The inter-

| 
change of ideas where all shades of opinion are expressed 
will do much to show the absurdity of the view that train- 
ing is no longer necessary after a certain period of experi- 
ence. Valuable suggestions as to methods and means of 
training will also be made. 
Topics Based upon the General Theory of Education— 
‘A field of information that can furnish many beneficial 
meetings for the interested, competent teachers is that of 
general educational theory, including discussions of su- 
pervision, administration, history and philosophy of edu- 
eation, educational psychology, ete. Such material has 
been sadly neglected because of lack of interest in it and 
also because of the difficulty of securing leaders who can 
present it in popular but correct form. Young teachers 
and many older ones are quite innocent of any under- 
standing of the aim of education or its relation to their 
specific everyday tasks. Speakers should be secured 
without fail who can introduce teachers to all the rich and 
interesting material contained in the history and philos- 
ophy of education and do it in such way that a genuine 
intellectual interest will be aroused. New books and mag- 
azine articles dealing with the material mentioned should 
be reported upon briefly and made available for those 
interested. 
Conventions, associations, or other gatherings of a pro- 
fessional nature that are attended by any member of the 
supervisory or teaching staff should be reported for the 
group. Again emphasis must be placed upon choosing 
delegates who can make an intelligent and interesting oral 
report. Outside speakers should be engaged from time 
to time to meet with large or small groups and discuss 
problems of particular interest. 
Teachers’ meetings can also be utilized to organize the 
required reading-circle work around local problems. This 
reading work, often done hurriedly with little real inter-
-P-A-G-E-359
          THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 339 
est, can be made to contribute effectively to the teacher’s 
power if it is properly organized. 
Conferences.—Closely related to the teacher’s meetings. 
just. discussed are conferences, usually with one teacher, 
though sometimes including two or three. In such meet- 
ings the very best supervisory work can be accomplished 
if favorable conditions are provided. There should be 
the freest of discussion upon the specific difficulties of the 
particular teacher. A detailed discussion of this phase 
of the supervisor’s work will be found in Chapter XVII. 
An excellent discussion will also be found in Gray’s 
article, Elementary School Journal, December, 1919, pp. 
273-275. 
Bibliographies—The supervisor should prepare and 
send out from time to time mimeographed or printed lists 
of books and articles dealing with current problems. 
Special attention should be given to the periodical liter- 
ature so that teachers may be kept in touch easily and 
economically with the latest in the field. 
While the supervisors should urge teachers to subscribe 
for professional magazines or to read them in the libraries, 
it is probably well for him to have a number of them com- 
ing regularly to his office where they can be obtained or 
read by teachers. In this way there is more assurance 
that they will be used. Reading-circle work should also 
be insisted on in some cases, adapting the reading to the 
particular needs of the individual. 
Gray reports that on visiting a public library he found 
an astonishing lack of books on educational topics. In- 
vestigation revealed the fact that there was plenty, of 
money available for the purchase of such books but that 
repeated efforts had failed to secure from the teachers and 
supervisors of the city a list of books they would find use- 
ful. Supervisors should not allow such a lack of codpera- 
tion to feature in their relations with the public library.
-P-A-G-E-360
       340 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  Closely related to this is the device of sending out 
mimeographed outlines of devices or special methods 
found by the supervisor in his visits or in his reading. 
Unusually good lessons, drill devices, or illustrations of 
skillful disciplinary work, ete., are all valuable material 
for such local bulletins. Due credit should be given to the 
teacher from whom the skillful device or bit of work is 
secured, 
Intervisitation—An excellent device for the improve- 
ment of teachers is the provision for a visiting day. Some 
teachers object strenuously and criticize the plan severely 
but if properly administered it is a proper and very bene- 
ficial procedure. Usually visitation is at the teacher’s will, 
but a better plan is to direct it in some measure. In 
Decatur, Illinois, an interesting plan was in operation 
some time ago in which the supervisor took a teacher or 
small group of teachers to observe one of the best teachers 
in the system. Any weak teacher in the system could thus 
be shown expert work upon any difficulty confronting her. 
Sometimes the teacher observed will be an expert in teach- 
ing, again she may be noted for disciplinary skill, or yet 
again for efficiency in the routine factors of school man- 
agement. Tact is necessary, of course, in administering 
such a plan. If temperamental or selfish objections are 
raised by the teachers who are directed to go visiting, the 
objectors must be educated to see the error of their way. 
Failing adaptability to the demands of good teaching, 
they must be eliminated from the system as painlessly as 
possible. When successful, such a scheme as the Decatur 
illustration stands as a good example of codperative 
supervision. 
Leave of Absence.—A leave of absence is often granted 
in order that teachers may be exchanged for a year be- 
‘tween systems in widely separated parts of the country. 
‘The requirement is usuaHy made that the teacher return     
     
-P-A-G-E-361
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 341 
for service in the original system for a year or two after- 
wards as a return for the privilege of exchange. 
Other reasons for leave of absence are that the teacher 
may attend a normal school or college for a semester or 
year. This is one of the most important phases of train- 
ing in service in the case of promising young teachers and 
competent older ones. Such work, at least summer work, 
required every second or third year of all teachers may 
eventually take the place of institutes. The supervisor 
should be ever on the alert for evidences of special talent 
or ability and direct the individuals to the training best 
suited to them. He should be reasonably familiar with 
the work of near-by normal schools and colleges, both in 
regular session and in summer; familiar enough with 
where the best work in particular lines can be secured so 
that he can advise teachers wishing to take advanced 
work. In some cases, as has been stated, teachers, in order 
to retain their positions, will have to be asked to take 
advanced work in prescribed courses. Such a request is 
eminently proper and legitimate. Teachers’ contracts 
should be so written that it can be made without argu- 
ment as to its legality. Every safeguard must be placed, 
of course, to prevent abuse of this request by supervisors. 
Once in a while that remarkable teacher will be found 
whom the supervisor must advise to remain away from 
school for once and go to the shore or the mountains for 
a real vacation. Such advice is as much in order as the 
advice to attend school. 
Extension Courses, Correspondence Courses, Lectures, 
Concerts, ete.—This type of work affords the teacher an op- 
portunity to secure advanced work without leaving her posi- 
tion. College-extension courses of especial benefit to 
teachers are now given in accessible centers, while corre- 
spondence courses are available at normal schools and state 
universities. 
   
-P-A-G-E-362
  342 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Extension work in educational measurements for a 
whole county has been very skillfully organized in Whit- 
man County, Washington, under the direction of Dr. Cliff 
W. Stone, of Washington State College. Teachers form 
themselves into groups which elect one of their number as 
leader, preferably a principal or supervisor experienced 
in the use of measurements. The group is then registered 
with the correspondence department of the college and 
enough copies of each lesson sent to the leader. He is 
responsible for distribution and explanation. The tests 
are given to the pupils as directed and questions are 
answered in writing. The papers of each teacher are then 
turned in at the next meeting and are all sent to the col- 
‘lege for grading and correction. In this way each teacher 
gets the correspondence course and also the benefit of 
group discussion. Those completing the course and pass- 
ing the examination receive the usual college credit. 
The general benefits received from those lectures, con- 
eerts, and plays which are available should not be over- 
looked, and the supervisor should assist teachers in this 
respect as opportunity presents itself. Most of the com- 
petent teachers will need no direction in this field. 
Museums and Exhibits—The use by teachers of mu- 
seums of art and natural history, of botanical and zodlogi- 
cal gardens should be encouraged and routinized as the 
use of the library is. Not only should they be used for 
informing the teacher but also as sources of information 
for the pupils. Much material for tessons and pro- 
grammes can be secured. 
Closely allied to public museums and collections is the 
school exhibit, of which Strayer and Engelhardt have the 
following to say:° 
In many school systems exhibits of school work have proved 
helpful to teachers. The worth of an exhibit depends upon its 
  
*The Classroom Teacher, New York, 1920, p. 52. 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 343 
uniqueness and genuineness. The specially prepared and care- 
fully edited products which are sometimes sent to fairs and ex- 
positions are not the type of exhibit that is needed. The regular 
daily work of the classroom, in so far as it can be put into form 
for the observation of others, will often prove stimulating to 
teachers facing the same problem with other groups of children. 
The writers remember a superintendent’s office in which there 
were filed by grades the compositions written by children. There 
was very great variation in the type of subject used, the illustra- 
tions prepared or secured by children, the form of discourse 
written, and the like. Teachers could be found in this office on 
practically every Saturday during the school year getting sugges- 
tions from the work of their colleagues. In the same office were 
the drawings which had been done by children and the produets 
of the work in the industrial arts. The course of study in this 
school system suggested many things which teachers had found it 
difficult to work out. The exhibits often made possible for them 
the realization of the ideals or plans of the course of study. The 
more wide-awake professionally a corps of teachers is, the more 
eagerly they will contribute to the development of this genuine 
type of exhibit, and the more certainly they will go to it for 
suggestions. A wise supervisory corps will delight in the varia- 
tions in the achievement of pupils and in the evidences of their 
attainments which are thus brought together. 
School Clubs.—Clubs formed for professional purposes 
are mentioned a few times in the literature as devices for 
the improvement of teachers. Probably the formation of 
elubs should be purely, spontaneous and voluntary. If 
there are sufficient and profitable teachers’ meetings held 
from time to time, very few clubs will be necessary. Social 
elubs are of considerable benefit and should be actively 
encouraged by supervisors unless they seem to become an 
end in themselves or to monopolize too much time. 
Social Contacts—A most difficult phase of teacher 
guidance is suggested in the following quotation.” As the 
‘Frances Jenkins, ‘‘Training of Teachers in Service: Adjusting 
the Normal Graduate to the City System,’’ N. E. A. Proceedings, 
1913, p. 448. 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
344 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
extract states, little advice can be given the supervisor, 
who must follow the best procedure that suggests itself 
in each case. 
Recognizing that the school is an increasingly powerful factor 
in influencing the broad community interests, we see the need for 
helping the normal graduate to make such relationships as will 
be inspirational to her and helpful to the community. This is 
one of the most difficult problems confronting the supervisor. 
Many times intimate personal points of view debar the graduate 
from establishing effective relationships, prejudices are present 
which prevent contact, habits of behavior which are unpleasant 
to encounter. Again indifference is most powerful in keeping a 
teacher in a rut. One hesitates to say: “Do you know that your 
eard should be sent in recognition of this courtesy?” “Why did 
you fail to return that call?” “You are mistaken in saying that 
you had no dress suited for this occasion.” Yet one difficulty in 
establishing right relationships grows out of just such failures to 
meet common social conventions. The need. for making friends 
outside of the teaching force, for finding wholesome modes of 
recreation, for assuming community obligations in church, or 
club, or charitable work—these are factors with which super- 
vision may wish to concern itself, yet in accomplishing which, it 
finds its hands tied. Our parents’ associations offer opportunities 
for such contact, but only too frequently the graduate has to be 
told the courtesies of the hostess, has to be urged to take the 
initiative in making the mothers feel at home. The supervisor 
may be of some help in making these community adjustments 
through a personal word here, an introduction there, an oppor- 
tunity for special recognition or service, but the problem remains 
largely unsolved, yet in great need of solution. 
The opposite problem from one of those stated above 
also deserves the attention of the supervisor. Sometimes 
a conscientious teacher will overload herself with obliga- 
tions to the local Sunday school or church, with other 
community work, club work, ete. This teacher must be 
advised in some tactful way to find a better adjustment 
of community and school claims upon her time. Outside 
community work is valuable only as it contributes some- 
   
-P-A-G-E-365
    THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 345 
thing to the teacher as well as to the community. Proper 
physical and mental health to be devoted to teaching is 
the teacher’s first concern, and if outside work, worthy as 
it may be, interferes, it must be eliminated or lessened in 
amount. 
Again, the problem of ‘‘making friends outside of the 
teaching force’’ may be the problem of too many friends 
and of the wrong kind. Business houses of all kinds are 
taking the stand that it is legitimate for them to inquire 
into the companionships and recreations of their em- 
ployees, especially in the cases of those upon whom rests 
responsibility and dignity. Much more vital are the 
teacher’s friendships and recreations out of school. Ad- 
ministrative and supervisory officers have the right to 
indicate that certain activities that are plainly detri- 
mental to the school be avoided. 
The Merit System of Promotion as an Improvement 
Device.—Merit systems of various kinds have been tried 
out in many places but are not generally regarded as sat- 
isfactory. Because of this fact, together with the diver- 
sity of plans in operation or that have been tried, an 
extended discussion will be omitted here. Very recently 
there has been a revival of interest in merit systems be- 
cause the development of tests and measurements and the 
refinement of teacher-rating schemes has seemed to prom- 
ise a greater degree of success than heretofore. Possibly 
a literature will develop as experiments at present under 
way are completed and analyzed. For a summary of what 
had been done up to the beginning of the last decade the 
reader is referred to United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion, Bulletin No. 3, 1911, pp. 116-150.

of information and ability possessed by experienced 
teachers can be of great assistance to supervisory and 
administrative officers and should be utilized to the ut- 
most. Since the theory of supervision advanced in this 
book is based upon the idea of codperative work between 
teacher and supervisor, extended discussion will not be 
given here as it would only repeat the many illustrations 
of such work given in different chapters. 
The Rating of Teachers and Improvement in Service.— 
Teacher rating has been all too often an administrative 
device for determining promotion, salary increases, etc., 
or for recording a teacher’s status. Emphasis should be 
shifted to the possibilities of rating as a method of im- 
provement in service. The following chapter will be 
devoted to this matter.

CHAPTER XV 
THE RATING OF TEACHERS 
Despite the claims of certain educational sentimentalists that 
it is little short of sacrilegious for a supervisor to judge his 
teachers in relation to their ability to instruct, it is nevertheless 
a fact that this is one of the very best excuses for his existence. 
I do not see how he would justify his existence if he did not 
think of teaching in terms of efficiency levels.t 
Rating is fundamentally wrong, impossible of just and correct 
application, lowering to the self-respect and dignity of teachers, 
both to themselves and in the eyes of parents and children, 
entirely unnecessary, a detriment to good pedagogy, and a bar to 
placing teaching among the professions.” 
The two diametrically opposed opinions quoted indicate 
why some of the most difficult supervisory problems 
center around the problem of teacher rating. A careful 
and impartial examination of the numerous discussions of 
this topic would seem to justify the conclusion that few 
logical arguments are advanced against the theory of 
rating. As a rule the statements are really based upon 
the defects, dangers, and abuses of rating rather than 
upon any fundamental flaw in the theory. It is not neces- 
sary for our purpose to go into a detailed discussion of the 
arguments, but in order to obtain a better understanding 
of the whole problem, one of the most direct indictments 
of rating will be analyzed.

  THE RATING OF TEACHERS 349 
Plea for the Abolition of Rating —Miss Ava Parrott, 
who takes the position set forth in the second quotation 
above, presents the following arguments for the abolition 
of rating. Ratings are bad because: (1) They prevent 
teaching from becoming a profession. (2) They differ 
with individuals operating the scheme and therefore can- 
not be fair. They should not, therefore, determine salary. 
(3) Rating is open to abuse and to unfair discrimination. 
(4) It forces the teacher to stress what the supervisor 
wishes and prohibits teaching what the children really 
need. 
Does Rating Prevent Teaching from Becoming a Profes- 
sion?—In attempting to show that the other professions are 
not rated, Miss Parrott correctly points out that the 
average citizen confuses rating as applied to teachers and 
approval or disapproval as accorded by the public to doc- 
tors and lawyers. Beyond this point, however, it is diffi- 
eult to see the weight of her arguments. She overlooks the 
fact that the professional worker can be disbarred from 
the profession, which indicates the existence of a standard 
under which he operates, even though it is remote and 
applied but infrequently. The point is also overlooked, 
a most vital point too, that candidates for the professions 
go through a much longer and more rigorous course of 
training than do teachers. The application of ratin® 
schemes has for one of its chief ends the improvement of 
teachers in service through stimulating to further pro- 
fessional training. In regard to this point of rating and 
professional standards, Rugg says:*        
          
  One of the most acute educational needs is that of training 
teachers in service. As they enter the service, teachers are typ- 
ieally untrained. Furthermore, tenure is short, the modal length              
   
  *H. O. Rugg, ‘‘ Self-Improvement of Teachers through Self-Rating; 
a New Scale for Rating Teachers’ Efficiency,’’ Elementary Schoot 
Journal, vol. 20, p. 670. 
     
-P-A-G-E-370
    
    850 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
of service being two years. At least 175,000 teachers enter service 
every year. Especially is this true in small towns and cities which 
receive the transients and which are really training centers for 
those who go on to the larger school systems. In large cities 
there is a converse situation. There long tenure is accompanied 
by relatively few “training” interruptions. Automatic salary 
increases tend, when taken with long tenure and lack of stim- 
ulating training, to reduce teachers to routine “trade workers.” 
Such teachers rarely develop an attitude of constructive criticism 
of their work. 
It is conceivable; therefore, that rating might well con- 
tribute to instead of prevent the placing of teaching 
among the professions. 
Does Rating Differ with Individuals?—Miss Parrott is 
eorrect, of course, in asserting that ratings will differ 
materially, depending on who does the rating and when. 
In Rugg’s article quoted above there is an interesting 
summary of evidence showing in what ways ratings will 
differ and to what extent. Ratings by the same individual 
made at different times will also differ materially. This 
is due to a lack of definite meaning attached to some of 
the elements in the scale, to the difficulty of objectifying 
the grades, to inherent human differences in judgment, 
and to errors in the formulation and application of the 
scales. Scales worked out codperatively and discussed 
frankly will be free from many of these defects. The 
methods of observing and judging are being refined con- 
stantly. Making several ratings at different times will 
contribute to the elimination of wide divergence of judg- 
ment. There is no logical reason here for the abolition of 
rating, but rather reason for greater attention to the for- 
mulation and application of the scales. 
Are Rating Schemes Open to Abuse?—In the hands of 
an unfair, temperamental, narrow-minded supervisor or 
politician-superintendent there is no question that a 
rating scheme offers unlimited opportunity for abuse.
-P-A-G-E-371
  THE RATING OF TEACHERS 351 
Such schemes have been manipulated times without num- 
ber with a most disgusting disregard for professional 
ethics. Teachers have been ‘‘hired and fired’’ on whim, 
prejudice, personal likes and dislikes, etc. But logic 
should not be misled by hopes and fears. The rating of 
teachers has come to stay, just as efficiency ratings of one 
sort or another are found in practically every line of en- 
deavor. If there is no definite rating card for the highly 
trained professional employee, there is the intangible but 
no less weighty, opinion of the departmental heads and 
company directors. Every safeguard should be thrown 
around teacher rating and no pains spared to see that it is 
fair and safe, based on a sufficient number of visits widely, 
distributed and, if necessary, on the composite reports of 
several officers. 
Any scheme for promoting or demoting teachers, ad- 
justing salaries, advising in regard to training, etc., that 
might be substituted would be open to the same abuses. 
The remedy is not abolition of rating but a demand for 
and constant effort towards better standards of super- 
visory training and selection of the personnel. 
Miss Parrott offers as a substitute a teachers’ council 
that would rate teachers, advise those needing training, 
and spur on those who were negligent or incompetent. 
The class feeling and loyalty would be sufficient, she 
thinks, to insure fair treatment to everyone. But teachers 
are human, in fact many of them claim to be more so than 
supervisors. It would seem then that the same human 
errors would be found in this application of rating 
schemes as under supervisory application. There would 
be some tendency to correct one type of error due to the 
large numbers involved but, on the other hand, a tend- 
ency to exaggerate another type of error because of lower 
standards of training and ability possessed by some on the 
council. 
   
-P-A-G-E-372
352 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Will Rating Force the Teacher to Stress Material Desired 
by the Supervisor That Is Undesirable for the Child?— — 
Says Miss Parrott, ‘‘Did not rating stand in the way, she 
(the teacher) would confer with the principal and be able 
to prove to him, sometimes, that his methods did not fit 
her class.’? Such a statement is based upon a complete 
misunderstanding of the nature of rating and upon ex- 
periences, evidently, with but one type of supervision. 
Undoubtedly there are many supervisors who insist 
rigidly on certain hobbies in method and subject matter 
and who would refuse to confer with teachers upon any 
topic. But the very essence of the best supervision is the 
cooperative determination of the very best subject matter 
and method for the particular class. One of the essen- 
tials of a good rating scheme is that it be worked out co- 
operatively and then applied by the teacher to herself. Her 
rating may be the basis of a conference and later the super- 
visor’s may be compared with it. Instead of ‘‘standing 
in the way’’ a good rating scheme should bring teacher and 
supervisor together in a most stimulating way. 
Substitute for Rating.—Miss Parrott then presents a sub- 
stitute plan for selecting teachers and excluding ineffi- 
cients. Candidates would present all credentials to the 
board and also speak to them on educational theories and 
problems. Thus the candidate’s poise, culture, dress, and 
general appearance would be open to inspection. Next, 
a compulsory observation law would be passed to enforce 
observation for a whole day during the year by some 
parent having a child in the room. In the absence of 
typographical marks used to indicate humor this sugges- 
tion must be taken seriously. It needs no further com- 
ment than the question: Why substitute for the rating 
of a trained, interested supervisor the rating of an un- 
trained, bored, uncritical parent, assuming that the parent 
could be forced to remain the legal time? 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
  THE RATING OF TEACHERS 353 
The article concludes with the statement that rating 
implies that teachers cannot be trusted but that super- 
intendents do not dare make such an assertion openly. 
Rating, of course, means nothing of the sort. It does 
mean. that the vast majority of teachers are pitifully 
undertrained and that the critical examination of effi- 
ciency is one of the best means of stimulating and direct- 
ing improvement. This statement of the meaning of 
rating can be made openly by anyone and supported by 
an overwhelming display of evidence. 
Proper Uses of Rating Cards.—It cannot be denied that 
many injustices have been worked in the application of 
rating scales. Caution is necessary in making and in 
applying the schemes and in interpreting the results. It 
is to be noted here that practically all of the discussions 
by people opposed to rating stress the fact that teachers 
are unjustly dismissed or demoted by means of applying 
arating scheme. Teachers should bear in mind that rating 
scales are just as often manipulated and misapplied in 
order to keep inefficient teachers possessed of a ‘‘pull’’ in 
their positions or to gloss over the complete failure of 
hopelessly incompetent teachers who, for some reason or 
other, must be protected. The errors and dangers in 
rating scales are by no means all one-sided. They favor 
the teacher unfairly as often as they injure her unfairly. 
As has been stated, the cure for abuses in rating of any 
kind is insistence on better training and selection of 
supervisors and upon composite rating using the reports 
of several officers. The cards themselves must be co- 
operatively determined. 
Furthermore, it is quite possible that no rating card will 
ever be constructed to include every point that should be 
used in evaluating a teacher’s work. The codperative 
formulation of them, however, should tend more and more 
towards agreement upon essentials. 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  354 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Finally, there should be a marked shift in emphasis 
away from the use of rating scales as determinants of pro- 
motion and salary and toward the use of them as instru- 
ments for the improvement of teachers in service. Their 
use in determining salary and tenure, in completing the 
office records of teachers, will always be legitimate and 
necessary, but these are not the principal benefits to be 
derived. This shift in emphasis is felt by several of the 
most recent writers, as is shown by the following quota- 
tion from Rugg’s article: * 
... if a rating scheme is to be truly helpful, its chief element 
must be self-improvement through self-rating. Improvement of 
teachers in service rests directly upon the imtial step of self- 
criticism. It is conceivable that this could be stimulated by the 
personal exhortation of the principal. It rarely is, however. It 
ean be stimulated from within more helpfully and continuously, 
provided objective, impersonal schemes can be developed by 
which teachers can be made critically conscious of their strengths 
and weaknesses. Thus, rating schemes to the present time have 
revealed an important defect, in that they were nearly always an 
administrative scheme superimposed from above. 
Not only should teachers contribute to the formulation 
of rating schemes, but the first application should probably 
be by the teacher herself. She might make two or three 
ratings at different times and then compare them. This 
ean be followed by a comparison with the supervisor’s 
rating and a free, impersonal discussion of any differences 
noted. The more frankly the making and applying of 
scales can be worked out, the more teachers will under- 
stand the uses, values, and dangers involved. As stated 
above, this will make also for better agreement upon the 
essentials and for more objectivization in grading. Such 
outlines as are given at the end of certain chapters in this 
book can be used by the teacher to make the questions

       THE RATING OF TEACHERS 355 
more meaningful. For instance, rating schemes often 
ask such questions as, ‘‘Does the teacher conduct drill 
lessons well?’’ A teacher may have a vague idea that 
she does or does not and have no accurate realization at 
all of wherein her drills are strong or weak. By turning ? 
to the outline of questions on drill, her thought is focused 
on all the different phases involved and she is more 
easily able to locate her difficulty or strong point. An ex- 
cellent, clearly written account of a codperatively deter- 
mined and applied scale will be found in an article by 
Connor, ‘‘A New Method of Rating Teachers,’’ Journal of 
Educational Research, May, 1920, pp. 338-358. This score 
card is remarkable also for its reduction of questions 
involved into terms of pupil activity. This latter phase 
of Connor’s article makes it unique in the literature of 
teacher rating. 
In the supervisor’s mind there should be taken into 
consideration any outside factors bearing on the ease. 
When pupils are given intelligence tests or school exam- 
inations, their present condition and previous school and 
home situations are carefully investigated. The teacher 
is entitled to the same consideration. She may be Jabor- 
ing under grave disadvantages, due to home conditions, 
lack of physical well-being, financial situation, ete. 
Given a codperatively determined scale, impersonally 
applied by trained experts and discussed openly and 
sympathetically, there are several possibilities. The am- 
bitious and conscientious teacher can be spurred on to 
the eradication of some unnoticed defect revealed by 
critical examination. In the case of the teacher who is 
lacking in ambition and pride, a rating should serve as a 
legitimate and deserved warning. For the younger and 
inadequately trained teacher the elements in the scheme 
may stand as standards of achievement. No one claims 
that rating will remake the teachers to whom it is
-P-A-G-E-376
  356 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
applied; it may even fail to give any results at all with 
some teachers. The idea, however, does undoubtedly 
possess possibility for much stimulation toward profes- 
sional growth. 
The whole topic seems to be undergoing a revival of 
interest lately and much very helpful material is avail- 
able in the current periodicals. 
Types of Rating Cards.—Score cards have been made 
out by many supervisors and research departments so 
that an unlimited variety are available. The three ex- 
amples given here are typical, each of a certain group of 
scales. Many others in each of the three classes illus- 
trated are available. Supervisors should introduce their 
teachers to the problem of rating through a discussion 
of the needs, purposes, methods, and dangers involved. 
Samples of different scales should be available and 
applied in practice and new scales should be constructed 
by the group. 
Example of Brief, Compact Rating Card.—The first 
example® given below is typical of those schemes which 
aim to get at the important features ofa teacher’s effi- 
ciency as quickly as possible: 
A. Estimate of the total efficiency of the teacher (social, moral, 
educational, ete.), in her relationships to the school, com- 
munity, ete. 
B. General estimate of the teacher’s actual teaching ability. 
C. Specific items rated on basis of class recitations: 
1. Speech. (Modulation and quality, rate, enunciation.) 
2. Governing skill. (Are pupils serious or flippant, natural 
or constrained?) 
3. Use of English. (By pupils and teachers.) 
4, Teacher’s skill in the organization of the material of the 
recitation.

Society, vol. v, p. 182.

-P-A-G-E-377
  THE RATING OF TEACHERS 357 
5, Teacher’s ability to fix the recitation in its proper setting 
in the course of study. (Connecting work with pre- 
ceding and following recitations.) 
,  §. Proper stressing of relative values. (Distinguishing 
: fundamental from accessory.) 
7. Skill in directing habit formation. 
8. Skill in questioning. (Are the questions clear, relevant, 
too many, too difficult, too plainly suggestive of the 
answer?) 
9. Skill and care in assignment. (Making clear to the pupils 
the amount of material to be covered and preparing 
them for it.) 
10. Choice and use of illustrative material. 
. General estimate of the teacher’s actual teaching efficiency. 
(Made after specific rating of points above.) 
. Teacher’s total years of experience. 
. Number of years in present town. 
. Training: Number of years in high scHiool; normal, college. Qhaoa 
The first item, ‘‘A,’’ is a general rating and refers to a 
teacher’s total efficiency. Item ‘‘B’’ and item ‘‘D’’ refer 
to one and the same point, namely, the teacher’s actual 
teaching skill. The first rating ‘‘B’’ is made before 
examining the questions or observing the teacher in the 
light of definite questions. The rating ‘‘D’’ is then made 
after a particularized observation and compared with the 
original ‘‘B’’ score. All points in the scale are graded 
from 1 to 10, 1 being exceptionally good and 10 very poor. 
Seales of this type are easily made and tried out. 
Example of a More Detailed Card.—The following card 
was worked out by students in supervision classes at 
Washington State College in 1919-20-21. Tach class 
made minor changes and differed somewhat as to the 
number and importance of points to be included, but all 
agreed in the main on the essentials and the card was 
used extensively in practice supervision.

A Ratina Carp ror TEACHERS ~ 
This sheet is intended to be used as a score cal “For the sake 
of uniformity the teacher will be graded on the points listed as 
follows: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Unsatisfactory. These 
grades may be written in after the topic, or columns may be 
drawn and a check placed in the proper place. The list of points 
given may be added to at any time, since this one is not regarded 
as final or complete. The points may be weighted, if desired, and 
a teacher’s rating indicated numerically. 
Several purposes can be served. Primarily the rating should 
stimulate the teacher to criticize her own work; or the card can 
become a part of a teacher's record; or several supervisors may 
rate a teacher for comparison. In selecting new teachers the card 
can be partly filled out after an interview and then further sup- 
plemented from written recommendations.

The items under Division 1 on personal equipment are 
open to the criticism, of course, that they are difficult of 
definition in the same terms for different people. This
-P-A-G-E-381
THE RATING OF TEACHERS 361 
is true, but when several ratings are made, the variation 
will tend to be decreased. The elements of personality 
included were taken from studies upon the success and 
failure of teachers.® 
The items under Division 2 on teaching ability are 
made more definite by using the score cards for the differ- 
ent procedures as found at the end of different chapters 
of this book. 
The whole card might well be worked over in such 
way that each point be made in the form of a question to 
be answered, rather than in a general statement to be 
evaluated. It is given as it is, however, as a sample of the 
experiments of teachers with varying experience and 
training in attempting to arrive at a satisfactory scale. 
Cards of this general form are probably the most com- 
mon and, despite the difficulty in getting strict uniformity 
of understanding in regard to the personal qualities, are 
of considerable value. Many other cards of this type can 
be found in the literature, and an excellent tabular com- 
parison of different schemes will be found in an article by 
Rugg, ‘‘Self-Improvement of Teachers through Self- 
Rating,’’ in the Elementary School Journal for May, 1920. 
The article by Connor referred to before also contains 
interesting data on this matter. 
Example of an Elaborate Rating Card.—One of the most 
important contributions is a ecard entitled, ‘‘A Rating 
Seale for Judging Teachers in Service,’? by Rugg, 
described in the article mentioned above. On this card 
the teacher’s qualities are divided into five classes, and 
under each heading are grouped definite questions, each 
of which is to be checked as ‘“‘low,’’ ‘‘average,’’ or 
‘‘high.’? This first part of the scale was developed by 
means of a most careful and painstaking process in which 
teachers, principals, and superintendents participated. 
*See the Bibliographical Notes, Chapter I. 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
EO 
362 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
The second part of the scale is a device for rating by 
direct comparison. A scale is made by writing in the 
names of five teachers known to the rator as the most 
typical teachers in each of the following groups: best, 
average, poorest, better than average, poorer than aver- 
age. The method of selecting the names to use in this 
type of scale is described in detail on the back of the card, 
which is here reproduced in facsimile. After the difficult 
and arduous task of constructing this comparison scale has 
once been done, it suffices for some time and gives, atcord- 
ing to Rugg, a scale of considerable reliability. Some 
critics of the scheme feel that it would be difficult to con- 
struct a scale using the names of teachers so that very 
many“) people could be familiar enough with the names 
ased-to apply the completed card. 
SumMMaRY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
Rating cards have been utilized by administrators and 
supervisors most commonly as devices to determine pro- 
motion and demotion, tenure of office, salary increase, ete. 
These are all legitimate but minor uses of such cards. The 
principal purpose should be to stimulate the teacher to an 
intelligent self-criticism of her work. The fact that there 
are often abuses in the application of rating is a criticism 
of the supervisors and not of the rating scheme. The fact 
that many teachers are not motivated or improved is a 
criticism of the teachers rather than of the scales. Neither is 
sufficient reason for abandoning a device which, if properly. 
applied, is of much assistance. 
The specific card to be used should be either codperatively 
determined by all concerned, or chosen from those in 
existence upon the basis of examination and discussion. 
The whole theory, uses, dangers, abuses, possibilities, should 
be carefully explained to teachers and questions answered. 
Preferably the teacher should apply the card herself 
several times to her own work and then compare later with

PURPOSES 
AND 
USE 
OF 
THE 
RATING 
FORMS 
FOR 
EITHER 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
OR 
COLLEGE 
STUDENTS 
OR 
FOR 
TEACHERS (The 
forms 
for 
I, 
the 
teacher, 
and 
II, 
the 
high 
school 
and 
college 
student, 
differ 
only 
in 
content 
of 
I. It is important to recognize that there are two 
separate and distinct features to this rating form. First 
— 
Self-Improvement 
Through 
Self-Rating. It 
is 
designed 
primarily 
for 
the 
student 
or 
teacher 
to rate 
himself. 
The 
first 
step 
in 
self-improvement 
is 
to be 
made 
critical 
of 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
one 
exhibits certain 
traits. 
Furthermore, 
clear 
recognition 
of 
one’s deficiencies 
can 
and 
does 
lead 
to 
definite 
self-improve- ment. 
Form 
A, 
therefore, 
is 
of 
primary 
importance 
in improving 
the 
student, 
or 
the 
teacher 
in 
service. 
To bring 
about 
self-improvement, 
therefore, 
both 
student and 
teacher 
should 
rate 
themselves, 
at 
least 
once 
each year, 
each 
question 
on 
the 
form 
being 
answered. 
Second—The Rating Scale. A method of giving 
a person a numerical rating (116, or 132, or 74, etc.) 
of which the reliability is definitely known, and with 
which others’. ratings can be directly compared; fur- 
thermore, a rating which cannot be confused with the 
commonly used “per cent” marking. system of the pub- 
lic schools. This scheme provides a method of direct 
comparison by which a teacher (or student) is rated 
on five different groups of qualities, by being compared 
directly with five others, whose names have been 
assigned definite positions on the scale. These five 
‘persons are selected so as to represent respectively 
(1) the best teacher (or student) the rator has ever 
known; (5) the poorest; (3 )the representative “aver- 
age” teacher (or student); (2) the person’ midway 
between the best and the average; (4) the one midway 
between average and the poorest. A definite number 
of points is assigned to each of these five positions 
on the scale; for example, 38, 30, 22, 14, 6, respectively. 
Thus a person is given a single numerical rating by 
totalling the points he is given on each of the five 
groups of qualities. In the case of teachers, this is of 
especial importance in rating for promotion. 
The scale is -so'coristructed that a teacher who repre- 
sents “average” in each will receive a score of 110; 
a teacher who represents “best” in each will receive a 
score of, 190; and the one who represents “poorest” 
will receive a score of 30. 
Il; HOW TO CONSTRUCT A RATING SCALE. 
(Form B.) 
A. Two important facts: 
1.It isvery difficult to make a rating seale properly. 
A scale cannot be constructed: in less than two or 
three ‘hours. 
2.Once made, the scale needs but little modification 
from year to year. 
B. Necessary steps in the construction of a scale. 
one are three major steps, in constructing a rating 
scale, 
First: step: Write down a list of 25-30-teachers (or 
students) 
ranging 
from 
the 
very 
best 
to 
the 
very poorest 
in 
your 
acquaintance, 
for 
each 
of 
whom 
you can 
acs 
the 
questions 
of 
Form 
A 
of 
the 
Rating ard, Important: 
(1) 
The 
list 
must 
not 
contain 
less 
than 25 
names. 
It 
must 
contain 
some 
very 
poor 
teachers, some 
very 
good 
teachers, 
and 
a 
considerable 
number of 
“average” 
teachers. Second 
step: 
Arrange 
this 
list 
in 
rank 
order 
of merit 
from 
the 
“best” 
to 
the 
“poorest,” 
separately 
for each 
of 
the 
five 
groups 
of 
qualities. Important: 
In 
ranking 
persons 
for 
one-group 
of qualities 
(say 
“skill 
in 
teaching”), 
the 
other 
groups 
of qualities 
must 
be 
absolutely 
ignored. 
The 
arrangement of 
the 
list 
in 
rank 
order 
is 
the 
most 
difficult 
and 
im- portant 
single 
step 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
rating 
scale. Experimentation 
has 
shown 
that 
to 
do 
it 
successfully, the 
most 
effective 
method 
is 
as 
follows: (1) 
Locate 
each 
person 
in 
the 
list 
in 
one 
of 
three groups 
for 
each 
question 
in 
each 
group 
of 
qualities 
on Form 
A. 
A 
study 
of 
this 
checking 
should 
enable 
you 
to rearrange 
the 
teachers, 
or 
students, 
on 
your 
original ligt 
in 
from 
three 
to 
five 
groups. 
(2) Next, therefore, group the teachers on the orig- 
inal list in at least three and, if possible, five groups 
—say put in one group the few who are markedly 
“best”; in another, the few who are clearly “poorest,” 
and the remainder in a third group who exhibit various 
degrees 
of 
“mediocrity.” 
If 
the 
large 
mediocre’ group 
can 
next 
be 
separated 
into 
two 
or 
three 
groups, it 
will 
facilitate 
the 
next 
step, 
viz.: (3) 
Rearrange 
the 
persons 
in 
each 
group 
so 
that they 
stand 
in 
exact 
rank 
order. 
This 
will 
be 
most difficult 
to 
do 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
“average” 
groups. (4) 
Complete 
the 
final 
“rank 
order” 
arrangement 
of the 
entire 
list 
by 
comparing 
the 
teachers 
near 
the limits 
of 
the 
adjacent 
groups, 
e. 
g., 
further 
direct 
man to 
man 
comparison 
may 
result 
in 
interchanging 
indi- viduals 
from, 
say, 
a 
“better 
than 
average” 
to 
an 
“aver- age” 
group. When 
the 
original 
list 
is 
finally 
arranged 
in 
the 
rank order, 
you 
are 
ready 
for 
the Third 
and 
last 
step 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
a rating 
scale: 
Select 
five 
persons 
to 
occupy 
the 
five positions 
on 
the 
scale 
in 
each 
group 
of 
- qualities. Do 
this 
as 
follows: 
(1) 
make 
a 
final 
decision 
as to 
which 
of 
the 
two 
or 
three 
persons 
in 
the 
“rank order” 
list 
is 
really 
the 
“best” 
one 
you 
ever 
knew and 
can 
now 
wise 
for 
purposes 
of 
scale-comparison; (2) 
Select 
in 
‘same 
way 
the, 
“poorest” 
for 
the 
scale. (3) 
From 
the 
two 
or 
three 
who 
stand 
uearest 
the middle 
of 
the 
list, 
decide 
upon 
the 
best 
one 
to 
repre- the 
groups 
of 
qualities 
and 
definitional 
questions. 
Therefore, 
the 
same 
description 
applies 
to 
either.) 
1 sent 
the 
“average” 
position 
on 
the 
scale; 
(4 
and 
5) similarly 
with 
the 
ones 
to 
occupy 
the 
position 
half way 
between 
the 
average 
and 
best, 
and 
half 
way between 
average 
and 
poorest. 
These 
are 
called respectively 
“better 
than 
average” 
and 
“poorer 
than average.” 
Important: 
Experimentation 
and 
experience 
in’ 
the army 
has 
shown 
that 
the 
scale, 
can 
be 
made 
properly only 
by 
carrying 
through 
these 
major 
steps 
separately for 
each 
group 
of 
qualities 
on 
the 
scale. Ill. 
HOW 
TO 
RATE 
TEACHERS 
ON 
THE 
SCALE. 1. 
The 
rating 
is 
to 
be 
made 
for 
one 
group 
of qualities 
at 
a 
time, 
giving 
each 
persori 
a 
stated 
num- ber 
of 
points 
for 
that 
quality. 
It 
is 
done 
by 
com- paring 
the 
person’s 
qualities 
directly 
with 
those 
of the 
others 
whose 
names 
appear 
on 
the 
scale. 
Visual- ize 
each 
one 
as 
vividly 
as 
possible, 
thus 
locating 
a person 
at 
a 
particular 
point 
on 
the 
scale. 
Be 
sure to 
give 
him 
the 
exact 
number 
of 
points 
that 
you think 
represents 
his 
position 
on 
the 
scale. 
The numerical 
values, 
38, 
5. 
22, 
14 
and 
6 
have 
been selected 
to, 
give 
you 
considerable 
opportunity 
to assign 
values 
between 
these 
set 
points; 
For 
example, in 
the 
long 
run 
nearly 
as 
many 
should 
receive 
23, or 
21 
as 
22, 
which 
is 
the 
“average” 
point 
of 
the 
scale. Important: 
In 
case 
you 
are 
unable 
to 
decide 
clear- ly 
between 
the 
person 
-you 
are 
rating 
and 
those whose 
names 
are 
on 
the 
scale, 
examine 
the 
results of 
checking 
the 
definitional 
questions 
in 
that 
group of 
qualities 
in 
Form 
A. 
This 
will 
enable 
you 
to 
com- pare 
them 
more 
concretely. 2. 
The 
total 
rating 
of 
a 
person 
is 
obtained 
by 
add- ing 
the 
number 
of 
points 
given 
him 
on 
each 
of 
the five 
groups 
of 
qualities, 
writing 
this 
in 
the 
com- partment 
of 
the 
card, 
left 
for 
the 
total 
rating 
at 
the lower 
right 
hand 
corner. Important: 
Scales 
for 
the 
rating 
of 
students should 
be 
made 
in 
group 
conference. 
‘All 
teachers who 
know 
the 
same 
set 
of 
students, 
should 
come together 
and 
construct 
scales 
which 
will 
contain relatively 
the 
same 
names. 
It 
is 
fundamentally 
im- portant 
that 
names 
assigned 
to 
particular 
scale-posi-: tions 
(“best,” 
“average,” 
“poorest,” 
etc.) 
be 
the same 
on 
the 
scales 
of 
different 
teachers. 
Otherwise the 
numerical 
ratings 
made 
against 
these 
scale-posi- tions 
by 
various 
teachers 
may 
not 
closely 
agree. 
If teachers, 
in 
conference, 
can 
agree 
on 
the 
natnes 
of students 
to 
go 
on 
the 
scales, 
numerical 
ratings 
made against 
these 
will 
have 
very 
great 
reliability.

must have the right to question and ask for further infor-

CHAPTER XVI .« 
THE TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 
Probably the most important element in the whole field 
of supervision, the most vital factor in the success or 
failure of any scheme of supervision, is the personnel of 
the supervisory staff. Leadership is difficult enough in 
any activity and is doubly so when the group led is made 
up of individuals whose social status is the same as that 
of the leader. Furthermore, the teaching group is pos- 
sessed of traditions and training that make all the more 
necessary a type of leadership that is essentially codpera- 
tive. 
Most of the criticisms made of individual supervisors 
center upon the lack of training or experience or upon 
weaknesses in personality. Many of the arguments 
directed against the theory of supervision itself will be 
found upon careful analysis to be based upon the same 
points. 
TRAINING 
General Statements.—Little has been written until 
recently about the training necessary for the type of 
' leadership involved in the supervision of teachers. There 
ean be no doubt that a thorough mastery of the general 
theory and specific practices involved in the whole prob- 
lem of supervision is essential, not only that the super- 
vision may be intelligent, but that the teacher’s confidence 
may be gained and held.

Among the answers to a questionnaire replied to by 
teachers, Gray found the following statement :* 
Only those men and women should be appointed as supervisors 
who are intimately acquainted with the problems and practices of 
the classroom, who are intelligently critical of what they observe, 
who are suggestive and constructive in their discussions of teach- 
ing problems, who are genuinely interested in the content and 
methods of instruction, and who consider the activities of the 
classroom the most important problems in a school system for 
study and investigation. 
As Gray points out, the statement might not be accept- 
able in the form given, but there can be no objection to the 
demand that if supervisors do not already possess the 
qualifications set forth above, they should continue study 
and training until they become intelligent, constructive 
critics of classroom teaching. 
An opinion on the same topic from another point of 
view is found in an article by Hosic:? 
Of course the leader is prepared. He was not chosen from the 
ranks merely because he was a good fellow, after the cheerful 
American manner of regarding each person as able to fill any 
office in the gift of the public merely by virtue of being a citizen, 
or at least a resident. He recognized the unique opportunities of 
the supervisor and made himself master of so much of tested and 
tried experience in that calling as has been so far collected and 
made available. He knew before he took office that supervision is 
not identical with administration; that4t requires a sound knowl- 
edge of educational method and a thorough acquaintance with the 
best of present school practice; that a leader in education must 
keep in touch with current literature and investigation; that he 
must be able to make intelligent use of modern statistical and 
experimental material as well of the more philosophical and 
abstract disquisitions of the neo-scholastics; that circumstances

and individuals are always different and, therefore, he must be 
always ready to discover and welcome something new; that a course 
of study should be more than an outline of topics, and a teachers’ 
meeting more than a guard-mount for general orders or a desul- 
tory talk-fest; that specific directions are better than vague 
theories, and good example better than either; and that if you 
really want to know what is going on in the classrooms of your 
school, you have to go and see, go often, look and listen, and 
stay through. 
The last part of the quotation is an admirable state- 
ment in general terms of some of the important phases of 
supervisory training. The opening sentences, however, 
focus attention upon one of the gross abuses and vital 
dangers in the selection of supervisors. Actually, many 
of the leaders are not trained. Returns from Gray’s ques- 
tionnaire showed that approximately half of the teachers 
who answered received no help from supervisors, and the 
natural inference is that in many cases the supervisors 
were unable to give any help. 
Again, while a supervisor should not be chosen merely 
“‘hecause he is a good fellow,’’ it is undoubtedly true that 
many are chosen because they are good friends of some 
administrative officer or member of the board. Teachers 
are justified in many of their complaints that supervisors 
are often appointed because of social or political ‘‘pull.’’ 
This situation presents one of the most difficult problems 
in the American schools. The only satisfactory solution 
will come as the result of lengthy evolutionary process. 
There must be an education of the public and the develop- 
ment of public opinion to an intelligent understanding of 
the needs of the schools and of the standards that must 
prevail for the training and selection of teachers, admin- 
istrators, and supervisors. Practically all maladministra- 
tion flourishes under cover and can be cured best by 
bringing to bear the weight of public opinion. Revolu- 
tionary methods will cure temporarily sometimes but 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  370 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
usually bring other evils at the same time. Nevertheless, 
violent methods are sometimes necessary to jar public 
opinion and to rebuke crooked school officers. However, 
teachers who criticize the supervisory system because of 
those unfair appointments must remember that despite 
certificate requirements there are still a considerable 
number of appointments made to the teaching force itself 
on the same basis. There are many incompetent teachers 
retained in office in the same way that incompetent super- 
visors are, through favoritism and influence. The defect 
is not peculiar to supervision, and the trouble in both 
teaching and supervision will be reduced more and more 
as standards become better known and more rigidly en- 
forced. 
Reduction of These General Statements to Specific Re- 
quirements.—Just how much teaching experience should 
be required of candidates for supervisory positions? Is 
normal graduation a sufficient scholastic preparation? Is 
college work necessary? Graduate work? What specific 
courses and fields of information should be included in 
the normal school or college work? Is there necessity for 
training supervisors in service as there is for training 
teachers? 
How Much Teaching Experience Is Necessary ?—It seems 
fair to insist that a supervisor shall have had as a minimum 
from three to five years’ teaching experience. The principle 
of individual differences should qualify this, of course. Less 
than this amount of experience will hardly give that easy 
familiarity with classroom procedure which is necessary, 
nor will it beget confidence on the part of those supervised. 
On the other hand, merely lengthening the term of experi- 
ence does not necessarily better either teaching or super- 
visory ability. 
One of the common pleas made by older teachers is 
that supervisors should be appointed only from among 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
  TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 371 
those teachers who have taught eight or ten, even twelve 
or fifteen years. Sometimes the statement is even added 
that this should be the whole of a supervisor’s training; 
technical training is discounted. Such a statement is a 
phase of the popular fallacy, held by many teachers and 
school patrons alike, that the experienced teacher is 
necessarily the best. Again the principle of individual dif- 
ferences must be invoked. Experience has no monopoly 
en success. Normal-school instructors, college teachers 
of education, and supervisory officers will testify that 
there are just as many poor teachers, just as many prob- 
lems, among the older teachers as among the younger. 
There can be no doubt that long experience, coupled with 
an alert personality, plus training through the years 
would make an ideal combination in the preparation of 
supervisors. \The emphasis here is not against experience 
but against the idea that long experience is an absolute 
prerequisite to supervisory work. In my own classes in 
supervision the three poorest students ever enrolled were 
three people each of whom had taught over ten years. 
The poorest teacher I ever visited was one who had taught 
in the same room for fourteen years. 
Both beginning teachers and those of long experience 
make blunders and call for supervisory assistance, but in 
different ways. The young teacher is usually marked by 
a lack of ability to adjust quickly in order to meet the 
vagaries of child nature, to adjust requirements to pupil 
capacity; by a tendency to emphasize unimportant facts 
disproportionately. On the other hand, the older teacher 
who has not kept up or taken training through the years 
will tend to lose interest in the new departures and be- 
come formalized. She can obtain fair results by rule-of- 
thumb method but is at a loss in new situations. The 
patience and skill necessary in showing another how to 
proceed, plus the ability to inspire confidence and beget 
   
-P-A-G-E-394
ee ee EY ee Seren er tbe PN em LORRY Ty UIST Se ey 
372 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
codperation, are in no way necessary outcomes of long 
experience. 
The Amount of Technical Training.—ldeally, graduation 
from both a normal school and a college would be desir- 
able. Normal graduates who become skilled teachers and 
who also show marked capacity for supervisory leader- 
ship should be given every opportunity to take advanced 
work during the year. A leave of absence might be 
granted in order that special work might be taken for a 
year at a college or university. In some cases graduate 
work should be encouraged. This insistence upon ad- 
vanced work does not mean that such work necessarily 
fits one for supervision. A bachelor’s degree or a year 
spent in graduate study will not necessarily fit one for 
supervision, any more than will long experience. The 
college provides an ideal opportunity for the study of 
theory and practice. More important than the length of 
study and number of courses is the nature and content of 
those courses. More important than either experience 
or study is the nature of the individual’s personality. 
The Nature of the Technical Training. —It would be diffi- 
cult to make out a course of study for the preparation of 
supervisors and be sure that it was complete and correct. 
. The following can doubtless be improved upon by teach- 
_ ers, supervisors, and administrators, but it is offered as a 
tentative and suggestive summary. Part of the work 
listed is obviously in the normal-school field, part is in- 
cluded in undergraduate college work, and some in grad- 
uate study. 
1. Pedagogy and psychology. The supervisor must—be 
an artistic teacher. He must be able-to-teach easily and 
effectively lessons based on the course of study under 
conditions prevailing for the regular teacher. This 
ability is based in part on natural ability, of course, and 
is enhanced through experience. It can be improved very 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 373 
materially in most cases, however, through theoretical 
training, through the observation of artistic teaching 
done by experts, and by means of special practice teach- 
ing under expert supervision. The observation and prac- 
tice teaching should be followed by critical analysis of 
the work done. 
The theoretical training must include a study of the 
principles of method, which in turn involves a study of 
the principles of learning. As has been stated before, 
teaching method is good only as it arouses desirable pupil 
activity. Therefore the nature of the pupil, his interests 
and capacities, ete., are fundamental factors and must be 
studied. In addition to courses in method, in genetic 
psychology (child study and adolescence both), there 
should be others in general psychology and educational 
psychology. The thinking process should be analyzed 
and discussed in terms of children’s experiences. This 
study of pedagogy and psychology should include as an 
integral part the consideration of experimental pedagogy, 
which is so often neglected in normal-school courses. 
Participation in experimental work would be very bene- 
ficial. 
In two very helpful articles Charters? points out the 
inadequacy of general principles alone. The supervisor 
must be trained in the specific application of the prin- 
ciples as well. Practice in supervision should be avail- 
able for the supervisor in training just as practice teach- 
ing is for the teacher in training. The routine details of 
visitation should be made clear as well as the nature and 
technique of professional criticism. The observation of 
expert teaching followed by thorough analytic discussion 
should be provided. Many teachers believe that super-

-P-A-G-E-396
ERE Oe ce eee BMT Tee YY OST eee ee ee Ee ee Ne ee eee me et 
; 
374 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
visors should be chosen only from among those teachers 
who have taught under supervision. A better application 
of this argument would probably be to include in the 
training requirements practice teaching under the crit- 
ical supervision of experts, this also to be followed by 
detailed discussion. 
The related field of classroom management, routine, 
and discipline should be studied in connection with the 
teaching process. The considerations here will lead to a 
brief study of the planning and construction of buildings : 
and the administration of the physical plant. The em- 
phasis in this latter work should be upon the contacts the 
grade teacher will make with such things and not pri- 
marily upon the viewpoint of the administrator. 
The experimental data upon which the daily pro- 
gramme is based should be touched upon. 
2. Curriculum making. In this field experimental 
pedagogy is again involved, with emphasis on curriculum 
building. The psychology of elementary school subjects, 
their history in the curriculum, the arguments for and 
against their inclusion, should be dealt with. There 
should be practical work in the selection of subject mat- 
ter and the building of curricula. 
8. Theory and practice of testing and measuring. 
Studies to determine what subject matter is most useful 
in real life involve the field of educational measurements 
as well as that of subject matter, since many of the stand- 
ard tests are based upon studies of social needs and 
usages. The history of the test movement, the theory 
underlying it, and the derivation and application of indi- 
vidual tests should be dealt with. This necessitates work 
in statistics as applied to education. 
The intelligence tests should be taken up historically 
and a study made of the psychology underlying the dif- 
ferent types. The theory and practice of administering
-P-A-G-E-397
TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 375 
the several tests must be included. Closely related to 
this is the consideration of child hygiene. All intelligence 
tests should be supplemented by a brief examination of 
the child’s physical condition. This examination must of 
necessity be somewhat brief and superficial, but the super- 
visor should know the average age and weight norms, 
chest measurement, ete., and should be able to recognize 
the common symptoms of trouble with the eyes, ears, 
nose, or throat. The easily recognizable symptoms of 
ehildren’s diseases should also be familiar to him. Chil- 
dren should be referred to the school nurse, the doctor, 
dentist, or oculist as cireumstances demand. 
4, Improving teachers in service. In preparation for 
his activities in bringing to his teachers the best new 
departures and discoveries in education, the supervisor 
must be given opportunity to plan and hold teachers’ 
meetings. The technique of the efficient committee and 
conference meeting must be worked out and applied. 
Definite bibliographic training should be given in prac- 
tically all courses taken during training. The supervisor 
must know how to keep in touch with current periodicals 
and new books. 
It might be noted in passing that most of the devices 
the supervisor will use to improve his teachers in service 
will equally well improve him at the same time. For this 
reason the whole field of training in service is doubly vital 
and anything bearing upon it should be brought to the 
attention of the supervisor. 
The difficult problems in the field of teacher rating 
should be most carefully canvassed. Practice in using 
several types of rating cards should be given, together 
with a study of the derivation of such scales. Practice 
in making up scales will be valuable since it will focus 
attention upon the desirable and undesirable elements in 
a teacher’s training, activity, and personality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-398
376 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
5. The general field of education. Not only will the 
supervisor’s activities be qualified by his knowledge of 
the aim of education, but he will often be called upon to 
explain such things to his teachers. It is no disparage- 
ment of the average grade teacher to say that she is, more 
often than not, quite ignorant of the big general aim of 
education and unable to apply it to the smaller problems 
of classroom teaching. Or a more competent teacher may 
call into question the whole theory underlying a school 
subject or procedure. The supervisor will need, therefore, 
to have advanced work in the history, philosophy, and 
principles of education. He should be well read in these 
general fields and should also be familiar with the discus- 
sions in the periodicals that attempt to make the more 
abstract theories in some measure concrete. 
6. Administration. In Chapter I it was noted that 
supervision and administration were at one time the 
functions of the same officer and that even yet the two are 
often confused. The supervisor occupies a strategic posi- 
tion between the administrative officers and the teaching 
foree. He is primarily concerned with the betterment of 
teaching processes but must at times take the attitude of 
an administrative officer. In some cases definite admin- 
istrative duties are carried by supervisors, especially in 
the case of the building principal. On the other hand, the 
supervisor must be alert to teacher sentiment and take the 
position of an emissary of the teaching staff in presenting 
their views and desires to the administration. 
Many supervisors themselves regard their work as 
administrative and ally themselves with the powers above, 
despite the fact that their work is more nearly like that 
of the teachers. Ideally, supervisors should form a dis- 
tinct group by themselves, building up standards, tradi- 
tions, and a technique all their own. Could such a con- 
dition be brought about, much of the suspicion of super- | 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
      ‘TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 377 
  visors existing among teachers would be dispelled. Like- 
wise administrators would be able to rely more implicitly, 
on supervisory reports of teacher sentiment if such 
reports were brought by individuals not definitely allied 
with either side of a controversy. Expert supervisory 
leadership will come more quickly when it is realized that 
supervisors are neither experienced teachers of good 
ability elevated to positions over their fellows, nor yet 
minor administrative officers in the nature of inspectors 
or spies. 
In training supervisors, therefore, attention to the field 
of administration will be necessary. Phases that bear 
more directly upon his actual duties shoald be empha- 
sized. The collection and distribution of school money, 
child accounting, the responsibility to the community, the 
contacts with the public, the conduct of surveys, the con- 
struction of buildings and the management of the physical 
plant, the keeping and filing of records, the cost and 
sources of supplies, are probably matters with which the 
supervisor should be reasonably familiar. 
Probably one of the most important duties in this field 
will be the supervisor’s participation in the work of edu- 
eating and molding public sentiment. School patrons 
need to be educated to appreciate and approve of new 
methods of teaching, of management, of experiments, of 
expenditures, ete., etc., and the supervisor with his ac- 
eurate knowledge and first-hand data should appear 
before parent-teacher associations and other like gather- 
ings in the continuous effort to bring about better under- 
standing of school problems. Because of this his training 
should probably include some reference to public speak- 
ing and news writing. A college course or two plus 
natural ability would probably be sufficient. 
In passing it should be noted that the supervisor should 
not only speak at parent-teacher associations and other    
  
-P-A-G-E-400
   
     378 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
meetings but should take an active part in organizing and 
directing such organizations. | 
7. Training other than professional. In addition to 
this technical and professional training there should be 
goodly allowance made for general education. Literature 
needs no argument and should be included liberally. The 
problems in sociology and economies are vitally related 
to and materially condition school problems. History and 
philosophy should precede and accompany the history 
and philosophy of education. Biology, or some other 
science in which the evolutionary point of view can be 
stressed, should be included. 
A most valuable item in the supervisor’s training will 
be the acquisition of the scientific method or attitude. 
For long this has been taught supposedly by means of the 
laboratory sciences. While it might be well to include 
some traditional laboratory science in the supervisor’s 
experience, it is no guarantee of the scientific method 
because of the unscientific and unpsychological methods 
of teaching in vogue. The scientific attitude can be 
gained as well, if it can be gained at all, in the field of 
educational measurements, in experimental pedagogy, in 
conducting surveys and investigations. Wherever and 
whenever possible the supervisor must learn to proceed on 
.the basis of impartial, objective, mathematically precise, 
verifiable evidence gathered by experts. Failing such 
evidence a summary of the best expert opinion should be 
taken as a guide. | 
The benefits that come from travel, from general read- 
ing, and from participation in community affairs not con- 
nected with the schools should not be overlooked. 
Guidance Obtained through a Study of Controversies 
Regarding Supervision—The foregoing outline of train- 
ing is based upon the theory of supervision outlined in the 
preceding chapters of this book. As stated in Chapter I, 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 379 
supervision was assumed as a necessary and vital activity 
in the school organization and no space was devoted to 
the arguments used to justify its presence. otbewon it 
is necessary that arguments for and against supervision, 
based upon the actual operation of the system, should be 
considered. Furthermore, a careful analysis of such con- 
troversies is of value here because of the inferences that 
may be drawn in regard to supervisory training and per- 
sonality. 
Of the many controversial discussions of supervision two 
excellent examples have been chosen, one from the teacher ’s 
viewpoint and the other from the side of the administrative 
expert. The first, ‘‘Defects of Supervision and Con- 
structive Suggestions Thereon,’’ will be found in the 
N. E. A. Proceedings for 1919; it is by Miss Sallie Hill, 
sometime president of the Denver Teachers’ League. The 
second, ‘‘Control of Progress through Sundae will 
be found in the N. HE. A. Proceedings for 1918; it is by 
L. D. Coffman, then Dean of Education in the University of 
Minnesota but now President of that institution. 
Defects of Supervision and Constructive Suggestions 
Thereon.—Miss Hill’s article deals more particularly with 
the special supervisor but the arguments are pertinent to 
all supervisors. The chief defects of the supervisory sys- 
tem as Miss Hill sees them are: (1) it is not democratic; 
(2) most supervisors lack training, experience, and per- 
sonality; (8) the specialist-supervisor requires too much 
of the teacher; and (4) rating power should not be in- 
eluded in supervision. 
Lack of Democracy in Supervisioni—The statement is 
made that there is too much power in the hands of super- 
visors, many of whom use it autocratically. The teachers 
who are trained in the theory of democracy and who are 
supposed to be training the children in the same theory, 
of participation are themselves never allowed to partici-   
   
-P-A-G-E-402
Ce re tee 
380 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
pate. They are never consulted, their practical experi- 
ence is disregarded, and they are but the mediums 
through which the supervisors work their own ideas and 
purposes. There is undoubtedly ground for Miss Hill’s 
vomplaint. One cause for the condition she cites is prob- 
ably the failure, already discussed in Chapter I, to imbue 
our practice with the best theory. Other reasons center 
in the poor training and personality of individual super- 
visors. The remedy lies in the education of public opinion 
and in the constant struggle for higher standards of 
supervisory training and personnel. If a number of 
teachers lose their positions in the endeavor to better 
things, if many are prevented from doing their best work, 
it cannot at present be avoided. Such casualties are the 
“‘erowing pains’’ of democracy, and whether we like it 
or not, they will continue until democratic practice con- 
forms to democratic ideals. They will not be stopped by 
eliminating supervision but by bettering it. 
Before proceeding to a consideration of Miss Hill’s 
other points let us digress for a moment upon the matter 
of democracy in education in general and in supervision 
in particular. Since the war much has been said concern- 
ing democracy by everyone from presidents and prime 
ministers to policemen and plumbers. The pedagogue has 
not failed to add his remarks. 
Democracy has implicitly in it the idea of delegated 
authority and of obedience to properly constituted expert 
leadership. It must be realized by all hands that super- 
vision, in schools or anywhere else, is a matter of con- 
structive, codperative leadership, if a general term may 
be permitted. There is no question, of course, that 
authority should be delegated most judiciously and that 
the expert leaders should be most rigorously trained and 
carefully selected. Much that has come from the teach- 
ing staff in criticism of supervision indicates that the
-P-A-G-E-403
  TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 381 
eritics themselves have been somewhat lacking in a cor- 
rect understanding of what true democracy is. 
Many of the strictures on the lack of democracy are 
not so much based upon any real lack of democracy in 
the leadership as upon the fact that there is leadership 
at all. Liberty and freedom under leadership is not so 
much desired as is liberty and freedom from leadership of 
any kind The liberty of whim, notion, and caprice is 
desired in place of the liberty of real democracy. There 
is often resentment against supervision on the part of 
teachers before they, have ever been under it or before 
they know anything about it. On this point we may 
quote Mrs. Susan M. Dorsey, former Assistant Superin- 
tendent of Schools, Los Angeles, California : + 
Whether supervision liberates teachers depends also somewhat 
upon the teachers, There are formal, hide-bound, minute-minded 
teachers who cannot enter into the freedom which wise supervision 
brings. Such teachers are enslaved to themselves. If by chance 
they were to reach the end of a ten-foot tether they would fear 
falling off the edge of the world. It is unsafe to offer supervision 
to such, in the form of a plan, for they follow the plan slavishly 
as the last word of wisdom. It is unsafe to suggest to such a 
standard of achievement for themselves or their pupils, for they 
will sacrifice pleasure, rest, even health itself, to pursue the 
standard. Mere hopeless drudges! 
Some teachers refuse freedom by creating an atmosphere of 
strife in their own souls against the imagined bondage of super- 
vision. That a supervisor modestly requests them to do a piece of 
work in a certain way provokes their antagonism and arouses a 
desire to do it otherwise. I recently had a lengthy conference 
with such a teacher. She was contentious, self-satisfied, fae- 
tious about trifles, even to the point of demanding to be an excep- 
tion to so small a matter as the position her class should occupy 
in an exercise where lack of uniformity would mar the symmetry 
of the whole performance, demanding also exemption from fol-

EK. A. Proweedings; vol. lv, p. 241.

382 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
lowing the method prescribed in a certain exercise. This teacher 
imagined she was seeking freedom; in fact, she was the slave of 
her own whims and caprices, and the wise supervision which was 
helping the other teachers only served in her case to waa the 
chains of an unloyely spirit. 
. mt . : 
‘An even more emphatic statement is found in Hosic’s 
article on ‘‘The Democratization of Supervision’’:* 
He (the supervisor) is indispensable, and where he is actually 
functioning, there is little excuse for agitation for more democracy 
in the school system. If agitation there is, it will be found to 
spring mainly from a desire to lead rather than be led. In fact, 
under the guise of democracy devoted may too often be descried, 
only too thinly concealed, the ugly form of bolshevism rampant. 
When a teacher accepts a position she tacitly accepts 
| the form of government under which her contract was 
written and which guarantees her salary. Her freedom 
does not lie in changing things to suit her own con- 
venience but in evolving new and better ways to do her 
work. Her emphasis should not be upon the fact that 
she is supervised and directed, but that she be supervised 
and directed in an intelligent and helpful way. But, a 
teacher objects, much supervision is not intelligent and 
helpful. This is true, but it must be approached with the 
democratic idea of codperation, and the teacher will find 
that she benefits, even if only a little. This bad super- 
vision will best be eliminated by increasing the efficiency 
of teaching and educating public opinion to see that the 
supervisors must be better than the teachers, must be 
trained and selected from the best material available. 
Vague and incoherent demands for teacher participa- 
tion are merely indications of stupidity. There is no more 
reason for teachers to participate in supervision merely 
because they are in the system with it than there is for 
  
5 J. F. Hosic, loc, eit., p. 331. r 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 383 
pupils to participate in school finance and administration 
merely because they are in physical proximity to the 
superintendent’s office. Participation on the basis of 
advanced training and evidence of expert teaching, how- 
ever, is as beneficial to the supervisor and administrators 
as it is to the teacher and should be arranged for as a 
necessary and intelligent measure of efficiency. The mat- 
ter of intelligent participation is well discussed in Hosiec’s 
article: ° 
. .. “discipline” must progressively be supplanted by codpera- 
tion. . . . teachers must be consulted regularly by the supervisor, 
they should be organized for that purpose—in order that the 
work may be more perfect and the community better served. . . . 
the concept of democracy should be more clearly defined, the 
standards of supervision set higher, and the training of super- 
visors made more rigorous and complete. A generous enthusiasm 
for the best things in life, a human sympathy that can touch all 
his colleagues, coupled with a true conception of his office and an 
adequate preparation for it gives us\the democratic American 
school supervisor. His tribe is increasing. May he see more and 
more clearly how to lead the way. 
But to return to Miss Hill’s point. | Much of the discus- 
sion regarding lack of democracy is\due to an incorrect 
understanding by teachers of what democracy really is. 
But, on the other hand, as she points out, much of the 
responsibility rests squarely upon the supervisor. He 
must see his position as that of an active, positive, con- 
structive leader, and not as that of an inspector or whip- 
cracker. His business is to direct, but the element of co- 
ercion is not essential to direction, its place being filled 
by the element of assistance. The people he is to direct 
are possessed of intelligence and training, which he should 
utilize to the fullest ; there should be no thought of substi- 
tuting his intelligence for that of the teaching staff. This

384 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
element of conference with the teacher for purposes other 
than criticism has been lacking in much supervision and 
should be injected into it as rapidly as circumstances 
permit. 
It is inevitable that ‘‘in the course of human events’’ 
there will be explosions and protests from groups under 
direction. Some of these explosions will be due to selfish 
reactions against conformance to any supervision, and 
every effort should be made to convert such people to a 
better way of thinking. They are entitled to careful, 
tactful treatment up to a certain point. After that they, 
should be dismissed as quickly as possible. 
On the other hand, one of the supervisor’s principal 
functions is to make conditions better for those under his 
direction. Therefore, when a dignified protest is pre- 
sented, based upon specific evidence, there is no loss of 
dignity or injury to pride in receiving it and giving it 
full consideration. One of the chief sources of power to 
a supervisor will come from the earnest codperation and 
loyal support of his teachers. In case of criticism of his 
work from outside his principal defense must come from 
the people to whom he has been of service. It is well, 
then, that without being servile or truckling, he give hon- 
est consideration to any protests or criticisms from those 
under him. 
This extended discussion of democracy in supervision 
has been given in order to emphasize some of the difficult 
problems the supervisor will meet, the reasons for them, 
and the lines of possible solution. | 
Supervisors Are Inadequately Trained and of Poor Per- 
sonality—Miss Hill cites violations of pedagogical prin- 
ciples by supervisors that indicate their lack of training, 
and she also criticizes the type of personality selected. 
Her position may be summarized in the quotation, ‘‘A 
departmental diploma will not fit the inexperienced, nor
-P-A-G-E-407
PSG ee aN Sel SEPP ete Re me Neeser ee MUrT Gye Use ner ee 1 rege tne ee 
TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 385 
a ten weeks’ summer course the experienced, person to 
supervise.’’ There can be no disagreement with her posi- 
tion as long as it is an argument for better training of 
supervisors. Such a position becomes illogical when used 
by some teachers as an argument for the abolition of 
supervision. 
The Specialist-Supervisor Often Requires Too Much of 
the Teacher.—This is in many cases a just criticism. Be- 
ginning teachers make exactly the same blunder in 
requiring too much of the pupils, and the supervisor will 
overcome his mistake just as do the teachers, by experi- 
ence and practice. He should be on the lookout, however, 
for this more or less natural error and endeavor to cor- 
rect it. 
The Supervisor Abuses Rating Power.—Miss Hill argues 
emphatically for the abolition of the supervisor’s rating 
power. Her attitude is not in accord with the best think- 
ing on this problem but is probably due to contact with 
the poor type of rating that is mainly administrative. 
Her case would be better if directed against the flagrant 
abuses of rating instead of against the theory itself. It 
is interesting to note that all teacher arguments against 
rating cite abuses resulting in unjust demotion or dis- 
missal; none mentions abuses that tend to continue in 
office incompetent teachers. The arguments on this point 
are summarized in the preceding chapter and need not be 
repeated here. 
If rating be necessary, adds Miss Hill, take it out of the 
hands of the supervisors and let it be done entirely by the 
building principal. There can be no doubt that an efficient 
and honest principal could give far more correct ratings 
than could others who visit less often. But the same 
abuses would be likely; principals are as often poorly 
trained and selected as supervisors. Furthermore, rating 
in the hands of one individual is more dangerous than
-P-A-G-E-408
    386 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
when composite rating, based upon the opinions of several 
people, is used. 
The article concludes with a plea for a type of depart- 
mental work to take the place of supervision. The expert 
teacher in each subject would teach several classes in that 
subject, dividing up the whole curriculum and grade sys- 
tem between the experts. This is a good plan in many 
respects and it is used quite extensively in upper grades 
and junior high school. However, such experts would 
profit under good supervision, just as the expert super- 
visor himself profits through his efforts to keep his 
teachers informed upon the best in the field. 
Finally, ‘‘If supervision is absolutely necessary, limit it 
to the giving of assistance in teaching and to the unifying 
of the work of the system.’’ This statement seems to indi- 
cate that Miss Hill’s experience has been with very poor 
supervision, since what she pleads for is what good super- 
vision really is, ‘‘assistance with teaching and the unify- 
ing of work.’”’ 
Control of Progress through Supervision. — Coffman 
states that when he first became aware of the strong feel- 
ing of antagonism toward supervision manifested by 
many teachers, he was disposed to side with the super- 
visors. A closer investigation, however, changed his 
opinion, and he believes that there are four marked defects 
of supervision, the correction of which will do much to 
eliminate the bad feeling. Supervision (1) does not fulfill 
its promises, it is not specific and definite; (2) it is often 
of the ‘‘inspectorial’’ type; (3) the selection of super- 
visors has been poor; and (4) there has been a lack of 
understanding of the technical nature of the supervisory, 
process. 
Supervision does not fulfill its promises. Many un- 
trained, oratorically-minded supervisors are in some 
measure responsible for this criticism. In too many situa-
-P-A-G-E-409
  TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 387 
tions there is not in evidence a definite, well organized plan 
for supervision, setting up certain objectives for the term 
and outlining the method of attack upon them. Even 
where there is a sort of plan, there is often no definite 
constructive work towards its fulfillment. In other cases 
supervisors are submerged in routine details. In still others 
they are mere visitors traveling from building to building. 
The remedies for such situations have already been touched 
upon. In many places this criticism would no longer be 
valid, since well organized supervision in the hands of 
properly trained peopie is fulfilling its promises satisfac- 
torily. 
The method of selection is poor and the supervision is 
inspectorial. These two points are intimately related, of 
course. As long as teachers of much experience but little 
training are selected, or people who are pets of the admin- 
istration, there will be the type of supervision that indi- 
eates a lack of understanding of the real nature of this 
school activity. The first three of Coffman’s points are 
added arguments for training supervisors to the very 
highest pitch by means of thorough and comprehensive 
practical and theoretical courses. The fourth also, while 
involving the lack of public appreciation of the nature of 
supervisory work, is fundamentally another argument 
along the same line. 
Lack of understanding of the technical nature of the 
work. This point is best stated in Coffman’s own words:? 
There is one additional reason why little progress has been 
made in the field of supervision and that is that nearly everyone © 
feels that he is competent to pass an expert opinion upon any 
phase of school work. The almost universal faith that the 
ordinary citizen has the ability to pass judgment upon the 
schools is shown in the great variety of reforms advocated. No

  388 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
matter how extreme the critic, if he declares that the schools are 
worthless and inefficient, the curriculum wooden, methods stereo- 
typed, and the supervision futile, he is certain to have a following. 
Obviously, the achievement of objective, experimentally, 
determined principles of supervision and the organization 
of a technique based upon them will contribute much to 
the removal of the difficulty cited. Coffman’s discussion 
of the nature of supervision, of the training, attitude, and 
personality of those who would be supervisors, is valuable 
enough to consider at some length: ® 
Progress in supervision should be made through the careful 
and scientific study of its problems. Mere opinion must give way 
to facts secured through trustworthy investigations. Experiments 
conducted under controlled conditions must supersede progress 
made by blind chance. Codperative work upon definite problems 
must displace advances made by individual workers. Sensitive- 
ness to problems related to the teaching of the different subjects 
rather than interests in mechanical devices must characterize 
supervision. 
All of which means that we must have and the future will see a 
new type of supervisor. He must recognize that first and above 
all the improvement of instruction must begin with himself. A 
recognition of his personal responsibility will keep him alive in- 
tellectually. Himself the embodiment of modern specialized 
scholarship, it will be possible for him to advance the intellectual 
capacity of his faculty year after year. Appreciating that, 
teachers cannot be left to sink or swim, he will seek to improve | 
them, not by elimination, but by education. Enjoying the quali- } 
ties of leadership, he will secure spontaneous codperation of his ( 
teachers and not be a fearless lord in the midst of those who fear, / 
sending out orders and commands from the central office. 
But where are we to find such men and women? In the present 
supervisory and teaching staffs. Where are they to receive this 
training? In the public schools themselves and in higher institu- 
tions. Schools for testing forms of organization and methods of 
instruction should be provided in every large school system. And 
higher institutions should recognize the peculiar mission they have 
*Ibid., pp. 192-194,
-P-A-G-E-411
  TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 389 
to perform in the training of supervisors. Everywhere vast sums 
are being appropriated for research in scientific fields. Colleges 
of medicine have their hospitals, dental schools their clinies, and 
colleges of agriculture their experimental stations. Everyone 
believes that most of the money expended in these institutions is 
wisely expended. We have great respect for the botanist who 
tries to secure reliable data concerning the radiation of leaves, or 
for the zodlogist who tries to find whether any relation exists 
between the length of the intestines of a fish and the depth of 
water at which it lives, and yet neither of these offers an oppor- 
tunity for social service that will compare with that of discovering 
the most economical method of learning to read the elements which 
should constitute our common culture, or the education that super- 
latively gifted children should receive. If supervisors are to merit 
and to dignify the offices they hold, if they are to be imbued with 
a professional spirit and in turn know how to communicate it to 
their teachers, then there must be experimental stations and 
agencies established in which they may make investigations and 
conduct experiments. 
This movement has already begun. Research departments are 
being established in city and state departments of public educa- 
tion, normal schools and universities are taking the initial steps to 
provide a more elaborate training for supervisors. 
Modern science must focus its attention upon the supervisory 
problems. It must be given the opportunity to penetrate emo- 
tional prejudices and to strike at the shackles of tradition. It, 
and it alone, can develop a critical type of mind which, after all, 
is the best guarantee of progress. Instead of prejudice, conten- 
tion, selfishness, and opinion, science must determine our biases 
and attack our sources of error. Studies and investigations 
extending over broad areas.and over long periods of time must 
be conducted. What we need is an impersonal, unfrightened 
approach to these important problems. The only way to escape 
from the unguided, drifting manner in which we have been 
attempting to make progress in the past is through the applica- 
tion of science to the concrete problems of supervision. Teachers 
and supervisors sent out from our higher institutions should be 
dominated with that spirit of humility, but in possession of those 
instruments which characterize the faithful workers in other 
fields. My plea, therefore, is that achievements hereafter be 
made in the supervisory field by those who are controlled by 
passionate ideals, by those who have the disinterestedness of the

scientist, not the attitude of the pedant; by those who are con- 
Scious of, sensitive to, and inspired by the real problems in their 
field; by those who are willing to devote themselves to the study 
of those things which relate to the improvement of instruction. 
Instead of being the victims of blind phantasy and aimless drift- 
ing, instead of being mere mechanicians, let us have more and 
better trained workers upon the scientific level. 
Another valuable discussion from which much guidance 
for the training of supervisors can be gained is Bobbitt’s 
“‘Mistakes Often Made by Principals’? in Elementary 
School Journal for January and February, 1920.° 
PERSONALITY 
Certain necessary personal characteristics have been 
directly mentioned or clearly implied many times in the 
preceding chapters, particularly in the immediately pre- 
ceding discussion. It is obvious that the difficult technical 
processes involved in supervision, necessitating for their 
success the codperation of a group of more or less inde- 
pendent individuals and affecting vitally the success or 
failure of many people, cannot be intrusted to anybody 
and everybody. What, specifically, are some of the neces- 
sary personal attributes of a successful supervisor? 
Asked to discuss this question before the National 
Education Society in 1915, Professor Crabtree found that 
there was no literature whatever upon the subject. He 
wrote to prominent educators, therefore, in order to gather 
data, asking them to express their views ‘‘hot off the 
bat.’? Among the answers was one from Hanus, who be- 
lieved that training and experience should be placed 
ahead of personality, but who gave a good summary of 
the desirable personality. 
Industry, even temper, ability to see parent’s or teacher’s 
viewpoint, no matter how mistaken, spirit of helpfulness (express 
  
®See Chapter XVII.

approval of good work as well as disapproval of defects), tactful- 
ness. There should be caution against expressing too much or too 
general approval, also caution against being influenced by the 
attitude of those praised. The supervisor should refrain from 
using the wrong word but should not be evasive; should have the 
courage and the intention to lead in codperation, but not dom- 
inate.?° 
L. D. Harvey of Stout Institute listed sympathy, hon- 
esty, candor, ability to remain unruffied by displays of 
temper, and also to remain unaffected by the attitude of 
those who get praise. 
W. O. Thompson of the Ohio State University listed the 
following: 
Genuineness, absence of affectation and the assumption of 
fancied authority. Avoid a patronizing attitude. 
A quick appreciation of merit which involves discernment, intel- 
ligence, sympathy, and which lays the foundation for constructive 
helpfulness. 
The teachable spirit which makes for humility and eliminates 
dogmatism, or offensive aggressiveness. 
The supervisor should be a student of people and methods, and 
have a firm and modest allegiance to principle. 
On the basis of the many and varied opinions gathered, 
Crabtree concluded that: ? 
(1) There is as much need of defining a desirable supervisory 
personality as there is for defining a desirable teaching person- 
ality. 
(2) The elements are cheerfulness, kindness, sympathy, agree- 
able-manners, true teaching spirit, genuine interest in the welfare 
of teachers. 
(3) These and other elements in personality can be improved. 
(4) Training school should give attention to the cultivation of 
the desirable teaching and supervisory personalities. 
(5) Supervisors should be improved in service. .

A list of the desirable qualities in supervisors as re- 
ported by teachers is found in a questionnaire report by 
Miss Bird. Several classes were asked to list instances of 
supervisory helpfulness, of personal excellence, ete., and 
the answers were tabulated. The questions asked ad- 
mitted of both technical points and personal attributes, 
as the list will show. The number opposite each quality 
is the percentage of answers mentioning it: 1°

  TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 393 
A careful consideration of the many and varied duties 
of the supervisor, of the intricate problems confronting 
him, together with a realization of the importance of his 
whole activity will furnish us with a check upon the dif- 
ferent lists of personal qualifications. ‘The big, dominating 
aim of supervision is the improvement of teaching.) The 
codperation of teachers is essential. The gaining of this 
codperation calls for kindness, sympathy, and tact. Con- 
fidence is engendered by reliability and sincerity. Loyalty 
to subordinates is just as necessary and important as loy- 
alty from subordinates. My own most unpleasant experi- 
ences in teaching were with a school official who con- 
stantly harped upon loyalty but who meant only 
subservience from those under him. He was deliberately 
and constantly disloyal to his teachers and coworkers. 
The supervisor must originate and carry through 
projects in teacher training, in the betterment of instruc- 
tion, in the organization of curricula, ete. This calls for 
initiative, self-reliance, industry, and perseverance. These 
qualities must be accompanied by enthusiasm and op- 
timism. 
The codperation of the teachers must not stop with 
passive acquiescence, but must be motivated and inspired 
to contribute and actively further the joint purposes of 
supervisors and teachers. This inspiration comes from a 
feeling of confidence engendered by a supervisor’s loyalty 
and sincerity, combined with energy, enthusiasm, and 
optimism. 
There will be inevitably, as stated above, explosions or 
at least friction and disagreements. These situations the 
supervisor must meet with tact, adaptability, resource, 
and infinite patience. A sense of humor, so scantily hon- 
ored in the study quoted above, is a vital and necessary 
part of a supervisor’s make-up. 
Will it ever be possible to find an ideal combination of 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
394 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
all these qualities in one person? Some people think not. 
An experienced teacher in one of my supervision classes, 
who was violently and temperamentally opposed to super- 
vision in any manner, shape, or form, after listening to a 
discussion of the necessary elements of personality, sur- 
prised the whole class by agreeing and stating that we 
should insist on these elements and appoint no other type 
of individual. Our surprise was, however, short-lived. 
The ideal personality struck this teacher as did the whole 
theory of supervision—impossible. To hold out for the 
ideally constituted supervisor was to prohibit any ap- 
pointments, which struck this individual as a good way to 
dispose of supervision! The case is by no means so 
hopeless, however. There are many excellent supervisors 
possessed in differing degrees the desirable personal 
qualifications, and there is much excellent supervisory 
material in the ranks of the teachers. 
Many of these qualities depend in large measure, of 
course, on native endowment, but everyday experience 
testifies to the fact that many of them can be cultivated 
in marked degree. Says Crabtree on this point: * 
A young man fresh from college had a most obtrusive, egotistic 
personality. He insisted that every teacher do just as he said 
whether they liked it or not. His teachers, the board, and the 
community soon opposed him. Pupils began to hate him. He 
was square, and began to study the situation. He finally took 
counsel of leaders among his pupils, teachers, and board members. 
He became convinced that he must be a guide instead of a tyrant. 
He began to let the teachers help him plan policies; he invited 
help and suggestions from the board; he even consulted strong 
community leaders; he called leading pupils into council. He 
learned that others like to help and that all together were far 
better than one unaided. His whole attitude has changed and he 
is a wholly different man in strength and effectiveness. He thinks 
it is because he grasped the social ideal.

  TRAINING AND PERSONALITY OF SUPERVISORS 395 
Whatever the difficulties in the way, and however 
remote the possibility of securing the ideal individual, we 
must endeavor to obtain as supervisors open-minded men 
and women, possessed of broad human sympathy, infinite 
tact and patience, and a sense of humor and perspective. 
A high idealism, stiffened by the courage of conviction, 
must underlie their efforts. 
The terms used in this section to describe personal qual- 
ities are often objected to because they are not objective 
and are not defined in the same terms for everyone. 
Such an objection is often a quibble that merely delays 
discussion and contributes nothing. Such discussions, 
though they do use terms that are somewhat non-scientific, 
are of real value, and interested students will arrive at an 
approximation of the terms that are usable by all. How- 
ever, that does not excuse us from the effort to make these 
terms more exact and definite. In the last chapter will be 
found a score card for teachers to apply to supervisors, 
the questions in which will help to translate the general 
terms here used into definite activity terms.

  CHAPTER XVII 
THE VISITATION AND CONFERENCE WITH THE TEACHER 
General Policy —Efficiency in supervision, in attaining 
the desired educative results, demands a unification and 
coordination of the efforts of every individual engaged in 
the different processes within the big complex. This im- 
plies and necessitates expert leadership. But it also 
demands just as emphatically that the individuality and 
initiative of the individual teacher, her spontaneity and 
professional alertness be kept alive and at their highest 
pitch. The contribution of the teacher is as vital and 
important as that of the expert above her. 
This problem of unifying and codrdinating through 
expert leadership and at the same time inspiring and 
motivating the teaching force, providing for its freedom, 
comes to a sharp focus in the actual visitation by the 
supervisor and in the conference that follows. The super- 
visor is called upon to confer with all sorts and conditions 
of teachers. They will differ in training from very in- 
adequate to most excellent, in ability to the same degree. 
All shades of professional zeal and interest will be mani- 
fested regardless of training and experience. Person- 
alities and temperaments will differ widely. All the dif- 
ferences noted will be further complicated by particular 
circumstances operative at the time of the visit or in the 
immediate past. The home life of the teacher, her health 
and that of the children, even the condition of the weather, 
will all serve in some way or other to make each visitation 
and conference somewhat unique. 
397 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
  398 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
Furthermore, the supervisor himself will inevitably 
have personal likes and dislikes which operate instinc- 
tively and which must be guarded against. His training 
and experience, temperament, and passing mood will all 
be involved in multiplying the difficulties of this most 
important part of his work, namely, visiting and confer- 
ring with the teacher. Therefore it is not wise to lay 
down fixed rules and formulas, though a general policy 
ean be delineated. 
The first element of general policy to be dealt with, and 
the one that is probably the easiest to dispose of, is the 
treatment of the zealous, well trained, and competent 
teacher. Supervision can here be reduced to an extreme 
minimum, and assistance should more often be given in 
Tesponse to requests from the teacher than on the super- 
visor’s initiative. Furthermore, the nature of the assist- 
ance will be quite different from that given to the begin- 
ning or inefficient teacher. As a rule, general principles 
are not adequate, nor are they the best form in which to 
give assistance. To the degree, however, that the trained, 
experienced teacher can apply such principles, they may 
be used. Considerable time and energy will thus be saved. 
‘Active encouragement should be given this type of 
teacher to undertake projects, experiments, and advanced 
work. 
On the other hand, many teachers and many situations 
will call for definite directions, accompanied by the tact- 
ful but firm request that they be carried out as given and 
at the time designated. The supervisor, however, must 
develop skill in recognizing those situations which demand 
this treatment. Even where such specific directions are 
given, it is assumed that explanations and reasons accom- 
pany them and that every opportunity is given the 
teacher to raise questions and ask for discussion. 
The right and wrong application of specific directions 
 
-P-A-G-E-421
  VISITATION AND CONFERENCE 399 
is well illustrated in the following quotation from 
Dorsey : + 
A clear-cut order as to time and place for delivering the 
registers at the end of each month, the precise meaning of each 
signal bell, the stairs and exits to be used by each room in fire 
drill, are matters that admit of but one interpretation and, if 
done at all, should be done according to orders. To carry the 
same precision into the exact number of pages and paragraphs 
to be covered in a subject in one week is slavish uniformity. In 
a recent survey of a city school system an assistant superintend- 
ent who was accompanying the survey official asked the teacher 
of a certain class what point her pupils had reached in their 
geography work. The teacher named the exact page and para- 
graph. “You are behind in your work,” said the superintendent. 
The class should have been working on a paragraph one page in 
advance of that which they had reached. And this man was a 
supervisor! I know a fascinating supervisor of drawing who, 
in giving lessons to her teachers with crayon, watercolor, brush, 
or other medium, hurriedly sketches the model, and as she 
sketches, says, “Now children (she always addresses the teachers 
as children and in that way tries to imagine that she is teaching the 
children themselves), you might do it this way, or here is another 
way, or you might use this for a model or that; you might work 
it out this way or that way.” What a variety of suggestions; 
what opportunity for experiment; what a great, broad, free 
world of form, color, design, and material to revel in! ‘Take 
your choice, teachers.” And teachers do take their choice uncon- 
scious of supervision, all the while contributing to their own 
supervision by suggestions and experiments, being constantly led 
into new, delightful conceits as free as the sky they picture. 
Definite, unyielding prescriptions where necessary, and an 
endless variety of suggestions from which to choose where pos- 
sible—these are the features of supervision which liberates 
teachers. 
Even in the field of method there is more and more 
ground for more or less definite requirements. Teachers 
sometimes feel that they should be free like the artist or

poet, forgetting that these workers too are bound and 
limited by the nature of their medium. This point is well 
stated by Bobbitt :? 
Teachers cannot be allowed to follow caprice in method. When 
a method which is clearly superior to all other methods has been 
discovered, it alone can be employed. To neglect this function 
and to excuse one’s negligence by proclaiming the value of the 
freedom of the teacher was perhaps justifiable under our earlier 
empiricism when the supervisors were merely promoted teachers 
and on the scientific side at least knew little more about standards 
sand methods than the rank and file, To-day it is an excuse that 
appears fair, but is in part but a respectable cover for ignorance 
and indolence. Nothing less than this is fair to the teacher. The 
amount of knowledge required at the present time in even ele- 
mentary education is so extensive that no one individual can be 
expected to cover it all. The principal must specialize in one 
way and the teacher in another so that their efforts may supple- 
ment each other. A supervisor’s primary function is specializa- 
tion in the science of the subject, whereas the teacher’s special- 
ization is in the practice of the subject. 
There can be no legitimate objection to taking direc- 
tions in regard ,to procedures that are by their nature 
fixed. When differences of opinion arise in regard to 
teaching processes, however, the teacher. should object, 
not to the directions given, but to the fact that the super- 
visor will not discuss them, if that be the case. The super- 
visor is not wrong in giving directions, but he is wrong if 
he will not discuss or explain them, or listen to the 
teacher’s views on the matter. The fact that he gives 
definite suggestions is really an advantage to the teacher, 
since she then has actual evidence for the basis of a 
complaint, or for proving the excellence of supervision or 
the lack of it. Much legitimate complaint has been regis- 
tered from teachers everywhere in regard to the auto-

cratic methods used by supervisors and in regard to the 
danger that attends any effort to advance legitimate dif- 
ferences of opinion. This phase of supervision will be 
discussed in some detail in the last chapter. 
General Plan of Procedure.—The supervisor should 
make a general plan of procedure for the year, just as 
there is made out a course of study for the teacher. Much 
of the slipshod, inexact, pointless supervision of which 
teachers complain can be eliminated by insisting that the 
supervisor’s work be definitely planned over a designated 
unit of time. Definite problems in teaching, in the selection 
of supplementary subject matter, or in teacher training 
should be emphasized consistently through a semester or a 
year. An excellent example of such a scheme, too long to 
quote here, will be found on page 266 of the Elementary 
School Journal for December, 1919. The outline sent out 
by, a supervisor in Decatur, Illinois, is quoted in detail, 
showing the problems of major interest for the year, the 
work already done, together with suggestions for attack 
upon the new material. 
Many suggestions can be gained from an examination 
of Pittman’s The Value of School Supervision. The ‘‘zone 
plan of supervision’’ as applied to rural schools is there 
described, but a great number of the things discussed are 
adaptable to city supervision. 
This supervisory plan or outline should be printed or 
mimeographed and sent to all teachers concerned. Later, 
at a meeting, details should be discussed and explained, 
while teachers are given full opportunity to ask questions 
or make suggestions. A thorough understanding by the 
teachers of the supervisor’s plan and aims for the year is 
the initial step. The announcement of such a plan in 
printed form is also strategically useful to both groups. 
It indicates that the supervisor has certain definite pur- 
poses, that he is attempting the betterment of teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
402 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
along certain lines, that he is inviting the codperation of 
the teachers in the undertaking. On the other hand, it is 
a safeguard and guarantee to the teachers that such work 
will be attempted. If nothing is done, there is then con- 
erete basis for objection to supervision. It might well be 
that the organization of such a plan should be delayed 
until school has started so that the specific needs of the 
group involved could be discovered and utilized. 
The Number of Visits and the Time for Them.—The 
first visits of the supervisor are usually for the purpose 
of familiarizing himself with the personality and general 
ability of his group. As these points become clearer and 
the routine points require less attention, the supervisory 
observations should be directed at such a series of prob- 
lems as mentioned above, at certain lesson types, or at 
certain problems arising out of the nature of subject mat- 
ter. The outlines given at the end of each chapter in this 
book are attempts to supply the supervisor with an in- 
strument with which to view certain lesson types. They 
ean be adapted as circumstances demand and very pos- 
sibly bettered materially by many supervisors. Another 
body of material, already referred to, that is of great 
value in the solution of supervisory problems is to be 
found in the Highteenth Yearbook, Part I, of the National 
Society for the Study of Education. 
Examination of current procedure shows the utmost 
variation in the number of visits. They range from daily to 
yearly, with the median as monthly. The number and 
length of visits must, of course, be conditioned somewhat 
upon the local situation. A part of the supervisor’s gen- 
eral plan, however, must be the definite provision for sys- 
tematic visitation. The routine office work, the adminis- 
trative duties, etc., must be adjusted in such way as to 
allow for the altogether necessary conference work. Fur- 
thermore, a record should be kept on prepared blanks of 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
         VISITATION AND CONFERENCE 403    
the number and length of visits, the work observed, points 
discussed, the suggestions made, ete. This is another op- 
portunity to make supervision definite and worth while. It 
also serves as a valuable record in case of controversy over 
the nature and helpfulness of supervision. Some examples 
of such records will be found in the Twelfth Yearbook, 
Part I, National Society for the Study of Education, of 
which the following are examples: ‘ 
May 25,1910. Grade 5. My impression of Miss G. as a teacher 
is that she is generally weak, indecisive, and uncertain. Her 
preparation is not strong, nor is her organization of questions 
or ability to handle the answers of the children. I nevertheless 
think that in the first or second grade she may do work that would 
prove fairly satisfactory. 
[Report on same teacher two years later.] April 25, 1912. 
Grade 3. I rarely have greater pleasure in a visit. When I 
first went in Miss G. had about fifteen of her children, the rest 
having gone to German. These in the room were reading to 
each other from a book which the teacher supplied, doing this 
most earnestly and seeming to be interested. Later, with this 
same group, the teacher was presenting a poor physiology lesson, 
but the children were working hard on it. 
Then I saw the rest of the class come in, in a most informal 
way and yet with such perfect order in the best sense that I was 
extremely pleased. There were forty of them, certainly not very 
elean and rather poor, difficult looking children, but they sat with 
bright looks and an attitude of expectancy which certainly spoke 
well for the teacher. They had a good language lesson in which 
all were working, and then they played a story which had been 
told well and with good spirit. I praised Miss G. for the kind 
of work she was doing and talked over her physiology with her, 
showing how she could make it much more valuable and interest- 
ing. It is fine to see her succeeding and in so difficult a place®

  404 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
May 9, 1912. Grade 7. Mr. R. I visited the room several 
times and saw parts of spelling, history, and arithmetic. In every 
ease the teacher was hearing recitations and it seemed that all the 
preparation necessary for such work as he was doing could have 
been made in half an hour. The spirit of the class was pretty 
good and they had the attitude of attention. There was, however, 
no genuine interest or anything to be interested in. 
In the spelling, rules and book statements concerning prefixes 
and suffixes were given by the class when called for, but there was 
left on the board without comment, criticism, or discussion the 
following list of words written by one girl: “sensor, migrator, 
interior, anchor.” 
In a discussion later with Mr. R. I pointed out to him that a 
wise discussion of those four words would have been more val- 
uable than anything he did in the class. The first word was 
misspelled; three of them, although they ended in -or, did not 
show the use of that suffix; and the fourth, migrator, is not a 
word in common use. In making sentences using the suffix -ness, 
the sentence “The sweetness of the apple is great” was not satis- 
factory to the teacher, but “The sweetness of the apple is good” 
was acceptable, showing how formal their thinking was. 
The history lesson was based on some papers the children had 
prepared. It was a review—six weeks before the end of the year. 
The children had made lists of American and British victories 
and of American and British generals. All they did practically 
was to read from their papers—not even a discussion of relative 
values. 
In the arithmetic, before they took up their problems on the 
board, the teacher said, “We will take up again our development 
of the subject of customs and duties.” This consisted of the 
following questions: “What do you understand by customs and 
duties?” “Why only on imported goods?” “What kinds of duties 
are there?” “What do you understand by specific duties?” “What 
do you understand by ad valorem duty?” In each case the 
children seemed trying to remember the definitions in the book 
and the teacher was satisfied with that result. 
I spent an hour talking over this work with Mr. R. I pointed 
out to him that it was bare hearing of recitations, without inter- 
est or genuine content, and then I took up each lesson in detail 
and showed him one way in which it might be presented so that 
it would be of interest and value. I told him I thought the 
ehildren’s time was largely wasted, and that they must have been
-P-A-G-E-427
  VISITATION AND CONFERENCE 405 
more or less bored by the work, and I tried throughout our dis- 
cussion to make him see that good work requires time and mental 
effort in preparation. A large growth and improvement is neces- 
sary before Mr. R. is a satisfactory teacher.* 
The last report, though a negative one, is an excellent 
example of supervision based upon the discussion of con- 
erete procedures actually observed. Such records as these 
should be required of all supervisors. The following list 
of things done by supervisors is taken from one of Dr. 
Gray’s class outlines at the University of Chicago and is 
evidently based upon an inspection of supervisory re- 
ports: 
Made careful inspection of supplies and equipment to deter- 
mine needs. 
Observed recitation to determine the kinds of results secured. 
Observed teacher’s technique to determine the appropriateness 
of methods. 
Made records on a standard score card. 
Talked to pupils about interesting topics. 
Taught all or part of a recitation. 
Gave tests at the end of the recitation to determine results. 
Observed teacher on phases of work where help was needed. 
Gave type lessons at the teacher’s request. 
These are obviously brief generalizations but suggest the 
type of thing upon which the supervisor should report in 
detail. Another excellent discussion of what may be done 
during a visitation or conference will be found in an article 
by Morrison in the Elementary School Journal for Novem- 
ber, 1919, pages 208-216. A large number of extracts 
from supervisors’ reports are given here. Miss Minor’s 
article, No. 14 in the Bibliographical Notes to this chapter, 
will also be valuable.

quickly the news spreads through the building, sometimes 
through the medium of innocent-appearing messages 
carried by pupils, sometimes by no apparent means 
at all! Such a scurrying and cleaning up ensues, 
such an erasing of blackboards, such a preparation 
of special work! How carefully the time is calculated 
so that the best work can be in progress when the 
door opens! This situation betokens a badly mistaken 
idea regarding the function of supervision. Teachers and 
supervisors are both in part to blame. Attention has been 
focused on the administrative phase of the supervisor’s 
rating power, while his most vital function, improving 
the teacher, has been overlooked. 
In the case of athletes, artists, writers, poets, ete., in the 
ease of any skilled performer, the one best record is used 
to determine his efficiency. Many a man holds a record 
or rating that he has made once and never equaled again. 
The teacher also should have the opportunity to show her 
very best work for the supervisor when he is primarily 
concerned with judging and rating. The supervisor’s 
visits should be announced ahead of time and not come as 
surprises. The daily programme should not be inter- 
fered with in any way either by supervisor or teacher. 
The teachers, instead, should be consulted and arrange- 
ments made for the supervisor to see the best work in its 
natural setting and at its regular time in the day. 
On the other hand, teachers know very well their weak 
points. The supervisor must know of them and assist in 
bettering them Therefore, he should also visit the reg- 
ular class work at other times than when the teacher is 
demonstrating her very best. By consulting the posted 
programmes the supervisor can insist on seeing the work 
that is scheduled for the period in which he visits. The 
supervisor should strive earnestly to develop such a spirit 
that his teachers will invite him to visit during the poor
-P-A-G-E-429
  VISITATION AND CONFERENCE 407 
recitations in order that he may help them. He should 
give them confidence that he understands the fact that 
some teachers can teach some subjects excellently and 
others poorly, that one group of children is more difficult 
to handle than another, that all the myriad factors of past 
history of the class and present environment will influence 
the teacher’s efforts; and above all he must make his 
teachers feel that he is not an inspector or judge but an 
assistant. 
By sending notice ahead, by noting the best work and 
assisting with the poor work, the supervisor is enabled to 
fulfill more completely all his duties to the teaching force. 
The teacher may keep notes of her difficulties and be pre- 
pared to ask intelligent questions when she knows that 
the supervisor will be with her at a definite time. 
A word here in regard to the so-called ‘‘special super- 
visor’’ who directs the work in art, music, writing, ete. A 
common procedure of such supervisors is to descend upon 
a building and overturn the regular programme of every 
teacher in the building, following their own devices as to 
order and time of visits. Such a piece of gross misman- 
agement and obvious stupidity should not be tolerated in 
the public schools. Sometimes this procedure is not the 
result of stupidity but is a clever device to hide ineffi- 
ciency. Many special supervisors thus escape definite 
preparation, hours, and results. There is no real reason 
why any supervisor, regular or special, should run wild 
in a building. Copies of the teachers’ programmes are 
available, and visits can be and should be made to coin- 
cide, with some few exceptions, with the regular class 
periods. In some cases in which a definite rearrangement 
of the programme in some room is necessary to accom- 
modate the special work, advance notice should be given 
so that one day’s plan can be made to fit the cireum- 
stances. In many places, of course, the special super- 
 
-P-A-G-E-430
  408 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
visor does schedule her work carefully and with regard 
to the regular teaching programme. 
Preferably a supervisor should see a whole recitation at 
a time and a succession of whole recitations before pass- 
ing judgment. The more expert the supervisor, the more 
he can determine in a given time. Experienced teachers 
will always admit that a supervisor can judge routine and 
disciplinary factors in a brief visit, but they object to the 
passing of pedagogical judgments on the basis of short 
visits. However, the same expertness can be gained for 
most of the common types of teaching, and short visits, 
when absolutely necessary, are a fair basis for judgment, 
though not the best. The important factor is the training 
and experience of the supervisor, not the time he spends 
in the room. It is assumed, of course, that the supervisor 
makes himself familiar with all the attendant cireum- 
stances, the previous teaching of the class, the type of 
class, difficulty of the subject, place of the lesson in a 
series, ete. 
Entering and Leaving the Room.—The manner of enter- 
ing and leaving the room are matters of routine that 
would not seem to be difficult to understand but that 
cause much of the friction between teachers and super- 
visors. The procedure ean be briefly summarized, and the 
expert supervisor will have little trouble with this point. 
Obviously, the entrance should be as inconspicuous as 
possible, causing a minimum of disruption in the work 
going on. The supervisor who deems it his duty to enter 
in a more or less pompous way and to bestow a hearty 
greeting upon children and teacher mistakes his proper 
place in the scheme of things. He is guilty of a breach 
of good manners as well, since an interruption in the 
schoolroom is as rude as and much more unnecessary than 
one in other forms of social gathering. 
The visitor should then stand or sit in such position as 
 
-P-A-G-E-431
VISITATION AND CONFERENCE 409 
affords a good view of what is going on, at the same time 
attracting as little attention as possible. Behind the class 
at the back of the room is in most cases a good place. 
Taking notes often disturbs and embarrasses a teacher 
very badly and should be avoided except in the case of 
the teacher who does not mind. The supervisor should 
have clearly in mind, however, the elements of technique 
involved in the lesson and make some notes as soon as he 
leaves the room, unless discussion takes place immedi- 
ately. The outlines in this book are, as has been stated, 
aimed at supplying the supervisor with a compact, easily 
remembered scheme for organizing his observations and 
notes. The preference of the teacher in regard to position 
in the room and the taking of notes might well be con- 
sulted. Leaving the room should be as inconspicuous as 
entcring. 
As a rule the supervisor should not step in and take a 
class unless asked to do so by the teacher. Usually an 
opportunity will be given at the end of the recitation to 
ask a question or two. In special cases permission should 
be asked to give a few questions to the class. If seat work 
is going on, the supervisor should go about the room ob- 
serving and assisting different pupils, following, as nearly 
as he can determine it, the teacher’s plan. In no case 
should the supervisor hold a class over its usual closing 
time because this may upset the programme for the entire 
day. 
The supervisor may ask some teachers to keep fairly 
definite lesson plans for a time, and he should inspect 
these plans from time to time. This is not necessary with 
the experienced teacher whose work is satisfactory. 
Demonstration lessons should be arranged and fre- 
quently given. The teacher should be consulted and 
allowed to ask for what she would like to see demon- 
strated. In some cases the supervisor should demonstrate
-P-A-G-E-432
EE EEE 
. 
410 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
what he sees the teacher needs. Except when absolutely 
impossible a demonstration lesson should be the next reg- 
ular lesson and not a special illustrative lesson chosen at 
random. As nearly as possible demonstration teaching 
should approximate in time and procedure the actual con- 
ditions. For purposes of special emphasis, however, a 
special lesson may be elaborated beyond the usual time 
and detail in order that the special point may stand out. 
‘All demonstration lessons should be thoroughly planned 
and discussed in detail afterwards. In the case of lessons 
taught before a group of teachers, mimeographed out- 
lines should be distributed in advance. 
The Conference with the Teacher.—There is no uni- 
formity of practice in regard to the type of conference 
that follows a supervisory observation. The all too com- 
mon practice is to hold a hurried consultation in front of 
the room or at the door just as the supervisor is leaving. 
Obviously, little good can result, while much dissatisfae- 
tion can be engendered. A somewhat better type of 
criticism, though still far from perfect, is that used in 
normal training schools. The supervisor writes out on a 
blank the principal points of strength or weakness shown 
by the teacher and places it where she will find it later. 
Skillfully handled, this type of criticism can be of some 
benefit, but unless discussion is also provided for, the 
benefit is not great. If the blanks are poorly written, 
there is no benefit whatever. The following is a verbatim 
copy of a supervisory criticism handed to a teacher in a 
prominent Middle Western city very recently: 
Miss X. 
These spelling records are not so good as they should be in 5B. 
Here are a few suggestions, which will help you to secure better 
results. 
1. Put no periods after figures. The red lines take their place. 
2. Never put periods after words. It is unnecessary.
-P-A-G-E-433
           VISITATION AND CONFERENCE 
3. Begin every word close to the red line. 
4, Take more pains with your writing. 
5. In marking corrections make your checks small and incon- 
spicuous, as: x or *, never X or ¢. 
6. Mark off all erased or marked-over words, also those re- 
written. 
7. Never number ahead. Number for the day at the beginning 
of the lesson. 
8. Please tell the children I was disappointed with the appear- 
ance of their papers this time, and hope to see a big improvement. 
Expect more from them, and you will get it. 
On reading such a criticism blank, particularly on read- 
ing point 8, one would suppose that it was directed at 
improving the neatness of the papers. In such ease it 
would not have been so remarkable. Inquiry reveals the 
fact, however, that the supervisor meant the first seven 
points as pedagogical statements directed at the betterment 
of instructional processes in spelling. There was no rela- 
tion in her mind between the first seven points and the 
eighth. 
A much superior type of criticism is found in the follow- 
ing paragraph, copied from the blank handed to the 
teacher : 
You set the pupil’s problem. What would be a better way? 
Why better? Does a self-imposed problem need much motiva- 
tion? 
You rejected the problem suggested by the class. Was it not 
in the project? You told them yours was the next logical one. 
What principle of childhood did you violate? 
Your unit of presentation was too long. What showed this? 
Pupils gave a good key-sentence for the unit but you made no 
use of it. Why? 
This series of criticisms is largely condemnatory because 
the case was that of a young teacher in training who showed 
marked inability to apply what she had just discussed with 
the supervisor. Ordinarily statements would not be so 
uniformly negative. The underlying principle is shown,
-P-A-G-E-434
       
     
                           
   
           412 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
however, namely, to force the teacher to analyze her work 
in terms of principles. This not only betters her peda- 
gogical background but keeps the discussion impersonal. 
Ideally, any plan of supervision should provide for 
definite conference periods at a time when the teacher is 
not already worn out by the day’s work. The supervisor 
should make a rather detailed outline of his visit as soon 
as he is out of the room, noting points for commendation 
as well as for correction. The consultation should be a free 
discussion in which the teacher feels free to ask questions 
and to offer counter suggestions as they are warranted. 
Sometimes a series of questions can be included in the 
supervisor’s mimeographed letters or bulletins to be used 
by the teacher in analyzing her work and as a basis for 
later conference. A good example of this device will be 
found in the Elementary School Journal for December, 
1919, page 274. Outline summaries given at the close of 
the chapters in this book could be mimeographed and used 
by teachers. Closely allied to this are the discussions based 
upon self-analysis by means of a rating card as described 
in Chapter XV. 
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the super- 
visor’s personality and his manner of administering indi- 
vidual conferences must be such as to encourage teachers 
to seek conferences upon any problems confronting them. 
Says Mrs. Dorsey: *             
     Supervision to liberate the teacher must be itself free and 
generous, given in an ungrudging, open-handed, at-any-time, at- 
any-place sort of a way. I once heard a supervisor of handwork 
who brusquely turned from his office a young teacher seeking 
help, with the remark that he was not giving individual instruc- 
tion, that if she had wished to learn how to apply that particular 
finishing product she should have been present at such an hour 
and place. Now it so happened that this young teacher belonged

                                                                                   to a remote school and on the evening when the particular lesson 
had been given she had been detained by a serious case of dis- 
cipline. She had sought the needed assistance at the earliest pos- 
sible moment so as not to delay the work of her class, only to 
meet a heartbreaking rebuff. Such supervisors are petty tyrants, 
not liberators. It all depends upon the supervisor’s tact, kindli- 
ness, and interest in his work and his desire to have the utmost 
of technical and inspirational help reach the children through 
the teacher. To liberate teachers, supervisors must not be mili- 
tary tacticians or mechanical organizers, but courteous directors, 
skillful suggestors, inspirational leaders, subtle pathfinders. 
Let us here reémphasize the statement made a number of 
times previously, that the supervisor is an active con- 
structive leader. The individual who conceives his work 
to be done when he has checked 4,976 squares on a series of 
teacher-rating cards and filled in 794 columns or filed 257 
reports each month is an inspector and timekeeper, not a 
supervisor. Rather, he must be judged by the number of 
creative, stimulating suggestions he makes, and by the con- 
fidence he begets in the teaching corps. Teachers must be 
encouraged to make use of their own experience and take 
an active share in bettering the work of the group. The 
supervisor must be infinitely patient and not unforgetful 
of the demands upon the teacher, knowing that the evolu- 
tion of good teaching is a long, slow process. Once in a 
while his criticism should be rough and direct. A con- 
sistently slow or shirking teacher must be told to ‘‘get busy 
or get out.’’ A whining teacher who cannot see why others 
are promoted while she remains behind must have the 
superior work of the others pointed out to her clearly and 
concretely through a comparison with her own weak points 
or lack of professional interest. The experienced teacher 
who feels that her methods are satisfactory despite the fact 
that she has had no training for many years should be asked

ting the results she claims. The supervisor should give 
everyone the benefit of the doubt as long as possible and 
should be most careful in deciding that a teacher needs 
sharp reproof, but when convinced that she does, no false 
ideas should prevent him from delivering it in unmistak- 
able terms. | 
The supervisor should encourage discussion of teaching 
difficulties and points of excellence but must be sharply on 
guard to avoid being drawn into gossip or into making a 
statement which, when quoted, will cause trouble. A cer- 
tain large group of teachers seem to thrive on back-fence 
gossip and a supervisor can ruin forever his opportunity 
for helpfulness by being drawn into the discussions that go 
on. 
SuMMARY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
The following list of specific suggestions is copied from 
one of Dr. Gray’s class outlines: 
Mernops oF Maxine Visits ProrrraBLE TO TEACHERS 
1, During the hour of visit. 
(a) Expressing confidence in teacher’s plans and purposes. 
(b) Encouraging teachers by favorable comments. 
(c) Pointing out strong and weak points in teaching, and 
giving helpful suggestions whenever they are neces- 
sary. 
(d) Giving specific suggestions such as, “Do not talk so much 
during silent study periods. Give pupils an oppor- 
tunity to work.” 
(e) Leaving written summaries of suggestions with teachers. 
(f) Filing a checked record blank with the teacher. 
(g) Asking pupils summary questions at the end of the 
recitation, thereby determining strong and weak points 
in teaching. 
(h) Suggesting experiments or general changes in methods. 
(i) Suggesting devices for economizing time and effort.
-P-A-G-E-437
  VISITATION AND CONFERENCE 415 
2. As follow-up devices after the visit. 
(a) Detailed conferences with individual teachers. 
(b) Group conferences on general teaching problems. 
(c) Bulletins of suggestions to teachers. 
(d) Helpful articles, books, and materials sent to teachers. 
(e) Bibliographies provided on one or more problems. 
(f) Demonstration lessons to illustrate effective teaching. 
(g) Visits by teacher to other classrooms for suggestions. 
(h) Reorganizing classes when necessary. 
The points in the foregoing chapter may well be sum- 
marized in brief, concise form for purposes of easy refer- 
ence: 
General Policy 
1, A general outline should be arranged for the year, indicating 
what is to be accomplished. 
(a) This should be explained to teachers and discussed by them. 
(b) They should be able to make suggestions, or even to aid in 
the organization of the plan. 
(c) It should be printed or mimeographed and in possession 
of the teachers. 
2. A systematic record of visits, time spent, points noted and 
discussed, suggestions made, etc., should be kept. 
The Visitation of the Room 
1, Entering and leaving the room should be as quiet as possible. 
Remain as inconspicuous as possible while in the room. 
(a) Usually better to sit behind pupils. Preference of the 
teacher should be consulted. 
(b) Avoid taking notes in room unless teacher states she has 
no objection. Make them without fail as soon after- 
wards as opportunity presents. 
2. As a rule, do not step in and take a class unless asked to do 
so by the teacher. 
(a) A question or two may be asked at the end of the class 
hour if opportunity is given. 
(b) Help may be given with seat or hand work. 
(ce) Demonstration lessons should be given frequently; pref- 
erably a regular lesson from the course of study. Con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
       SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
  sult teacher’s preference in most cases; in others give 
what she is obviously in need of. Such lessons should 
be carefully planned and fully discussed afterwards. 
3. Except when quite impossible, supervisor’s visits should co- 
incide with recitation periods as indicated on the posted 
programme. 
(a) Preferably the supervisor should see several whole lessons. 
(b) When brief visits are unavoidable, they should be numer- 
ous and distributed over a length of time. 
(c) Special supervisors should conform to the teacher’s daily 
programme, or arrange one nearly in accord with it and 
give proper and sufficient advance notice. 
The Consultation with the Teacher 
1. During the observation and consultation the supervisor must 
preserve the impersonal, objective, scientific attitude. 
(Suspended judgment and open-mindedness.) 
(a) Compliment what is good, giving reasons why. Give 
eredit for ideas that are new. (Recognition of work 
well done makes adverse criticism easier when it is neces- 
sary.) 
(b) Discuss all errors and corrections on impersonal, scientific 
grounds. Dispose of errors by giving pedagogical and 
psychological arguments and by supplying the correct 
procedure. Avoid use of “I” and “you.” 
(c) Correct one error at a time. Differentiate between errors 
of routine and the more important ones of teaching 
procedure, or professional attitude. 
(d) When a teacher persists in a procedure that is clearly 
wrong, the supervisor must insist tactfully but none the 
less firmly that the correct procedure be given full and 
fair trial. 
2. While the impersonal attitude must prevail in viewing and 
discussing the teacher’s work, there should be a kindly 
tact and sympathy manifested which will assist in putting 
the teacher at ease and in furthering the purposes of the 
consultation. 
(a) The supervisor must expect to win the confidence and co- 
operation of his teachers much as the teacher wins the 
same things from the children.
-P-A-G-E-439
‘VISITATION AND CONFERENCE 417 
3. The supervisor must distinguish between his functions as a 
judge and rator of teaching, and as an assistant in better- 
ing teaching. 
4. In making final judgments and important recommendations, 
apart from the everyday consultation, there must be a 
careful balance of the scientific and the personal factors. 
(a) The politics, religion, “temperamental reactions,” ete, of 
either teacher or supervisor are not legitimate elements 
in supervisory or administrative discussions. 
(b) Specifically, this means that a teacher should not be con- 
demned for other things than pedagogical faults. On 
the other hand, she should not be tolerated in the 
system when she cannot or will not adapt herself to 
recognized and clearly demonstrable pedagogical pro- 
cedures. 
4, The consultations, except on, very minor points, should not take 
place in the presence of the pupils. 
(a) Whenever possible they should not take place immediately, 
but after supervisor and teacher have had a chance to 
think over the details. 
(b) The consultation should be unhurried, should come at a 
time when both parties are free and not tired. 
(c) It should be in the nature of a give and take discussion, 
and not a monologue by either party. 
Students of supervision will wish a blank upon which a 
complete report can be made of all the features of a visita- 
tion. Regular supervisors will also have use for such a 
blank in making complete reports on special cases, or for 
filing purposes. The following outline differs from those 
given at the close of previous chapters, in that it includes 
all the points that will be noted instead of concentrating 
on some particular phase. The other outlines should be 
used in conjunction with it. It is not a score card, but a 
report blank. 
OUTLINE FOR OBSERVATION REPORT

3. Discipline. (Means, skill, occasions, )

(Evidence of careful planning? If self-selected, under what 
principles? If a text is used, is it adapted to the situation, or 
the situation to it?) 
5. The teacher’s ability as shown in the type of lesson observed. 
(This will be the body of the report. Discuss in some detail 
the type used: problem-solving or “deduction”; making gen- 
eralizations or “induction”; learning a new association or 
motor skill; drill; enjoyment or “appreciation”; expression or 
contribution lesson; assignment; study; review. If lesson 
observed was part of a project discuss the organization of this 
lesson in relation to the whole.) 
6. The teacher’s use of, or violation of, the general principles of 
learning: apperception, self-activity, use of interests, indi- 
vidual differences, ete. 
7. The teacher’s use of questions. (Number and kind; thoughts 
versus memory; pace; method of calling on pupils; skill in 
wording and adapting.) 
8. The teacher’s use of checks, tests, standard scores. (For 
adapting the work to individual differences; for grading; for 
securing interest; etc.) If the observer does not see an actual 
use of this material he may infer its use from graphs and 
charts about the room, or he may inquire of the teacher. In 
case this work is done by the supervisor himself, the report 
should contain his findings and interpretations, together with 
advice to the teacher.

        CHAPTER XVIII 
THE RATING OF SUPERVISORS 
Yes, and about the second time you attempt to make any sug- 
gestions to a supervisor, you'll be out of a job! And about the 
second time you lose a position for this reason you'll find yourself 
washing dishes in a Trent Avenue restaurant! 
So spoke an experienced teacher after a class discussion 
in which it had been advocated that teachers have the right 
and should feel free to make suggestions to supervisors to 
eall their attention to peculiar local conditions and even to 
request a change in procedure in some cases. This teacher 
speaks for a large number of teachers who do not believe 
that supervision can ever be liberalized. It will be recalled 
from the discussion of democracy in supervision in Chapter 
XVI that it was shown that there is much real basis for 
complaints on this score. There can be no doubt that much 
of the bad feeling is due to poorly trained, autocratic- 
minded supervisors found here and there who are quite 
unfit by training and experience for the intricate, highly 
complex kind of work in which they are engaged. But it 
must also be recognized that this situation is realized by 
administrators and the best supervisors and that super- 
vision is being progressively improved. 
Teachers Must Not Only Contribute to Supervision But 
Must Also Pass Judgment upon the Worth of Supervision. 
—In standing for the principle that teachers must con- 
tribute to supervision and judge of its worth I am fully 
aware of the difficulties in the way of practical operation 
of such a plan. A prominent school official in a Western 
422
-P-A-G-E-445
  THE RATING OF SUPERVISORS 423 
state recently notified a number of field workers and 
teachers that they must cease discussing educational poli- 
cies, cease voicing opinions of any kind at school meetings, 
on pain of dismissal and blacklist. In another case a 
school head did succeed in blacklisting a number of 
teachers who had been dismissed, though they were quite 
guiltless of any wrongdoing, professional or otherwise. A 
larger number of teachers than is ever suspected have had 
the experience at least once of being included in a group 
of teachers who are relieved of their positions without 
cause and without warning, solely because of the whim of 
the school head; who disliked some members of the group 
personally. In many public schools, even in normal 
schools and colleges, teacher tenure depends so largely 
on whim, caprice, or prejudice, that any attempt at 
originality or initiative, let alone an attempt at positive 
participation, would result in immediate dismissal. Never- 
theless it must be reiterated that supervision is a codper- 
ative procedure in the fullest meaning of that term. The 
teacher’s contribution is vital and essential and must be 
reckoned with. Not only must teachers contribute to the 
general policy and procedure as it affects them from day 
to day but they will probably be called upon soon to make 
specific statements in judgment of supervision and super- 
visors. 
In many situations, of course, there is a splendid spirit 
existing between administrators and the teaching staff. 
There is more and more opportunity for the well trained, 
competent teachers to express their real opinions. Their 
help is solicited by many of the more progressive super- 
intendents. In many situations where formal machinery 
for teacher participation has not yet been established, 
school administrators are receptive and sensitive to the 
views of the earnest, conscientious leaders among the teach- 
ing group.

  424 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
What Are the Factors upon Which Teachers May Be 
Expected to Pass Judgment?—Judgments passed by 
teachers upon supervisors vary widely and include prac- 
tically all phases of the supervisor’s work. Complaint 
and praise are both heard in regard to personal contacts, 
mannerisms, habits, hobbies, dress, training, professional 
ability, religion, ete., ete. The evidence upon which the 
judgments are based will vary from real tangible evidence 
of efficiency or inefficiency to pure prejudice on the part 
of the teacher. Unfair, capricious criticisms are by no 
means confined to supervisory sources. There must be 
some more definite understanding in regard to the factors 
upon which teachers should pass judgment and in regard 
to the methods of arriving at the judgments. 
Teachers’ Estimates of Qualifications—Guidance will be 
obtained by recalling the discussion of the supervisor’s per- 
sonality in Chapter XVI, particularly Miss Bird’s study in 
which were listed the qualifications for good supervisors as 
seen by teachers. The points listed in the order of their 
votes were:t - 
Kindness or sympathy, systematic individual supervision, co- 
operation, executive ability, professional knowledge, progressive- 
ness, leadership in community, reliable judgment, broad scholar- 
ship, flexibility of requirements, sincerity, good breeding, 
attractive personality, ability to discipline, good health, ability to 
make a speech, fairness, lofty ideals, the ability to smile, prompt- 
ness, reliability, poise, enthusiasm, moral and physical cleanliness, 
foresight, democratic spirit, resourcefulness, courage, optimism, 
sense of humor. 
Mistakes Often Made by Principals——Another source of 
valuable material in determining what elements teachers 
should look for in judging supervisors will be found in two 
articles by Bobbitt in the Elementary School Journal for

January and February, 1920. Though these articles relate 
primarily to the building principal, they should be read by 
all supervisors and teachers. Space prohibits a summary 
of the discussion, which is excellent, but the following list 
of points? will be of assistance in directing the teacher’s 
attention to sins of omission and commission on the part of 
the supervisor. Several points overlap somewhat. 
1, Autoeratic and arbitrary direction of work and of the gen- 
eral affairs of the building. 
2. Taking care of matters personally that ought to be delegated. 
3. Trying to take care of too many things at once. 
4. Lack of interest in teachers’ experiments. 
5. Unconsciously creating weaknesses in teachers by withhold- 
ing responsibility. 
6. Taking to himself credit for all successes in the school. 
7. Feebleness or absence of directive effort.

McMurry’s Principles—Following the New York City 
survey in 1914, McMurry proposed four general prin- 
ciples by which the worth of supervision could be esti- 
mated.® 
. one great function of the principal, therefore, is to con- 
tribute to her [the teacher’s] enthusiasm and to this insight (into 
relation between the curriculum and active living) . . . A second 
duty of the principal is to aid her actively in this whole matter 
{of organization in thinking], showing her often how she has 
failed to secure good organization, and how the failure might 
have been avoided. . . . A third responsibility of the principal, 
therefore, is to instill into the teacher the conviction that he is 
ever on the lookout for this quality [attention to relative values] 
in his observation of her instruction and to advise with her 
frequently about methods of improvement in this direction. . . . 
A fourth duty of the principal is to surround the teacher with 
such an atmosphere as will encourage her to think her own 
thoughts, and to express them frankly; i.e., to be her normal self; 
also to impress upon her that he is ever watchful of her provision 
for self-expression among her pupils. 
Definite Score Cards.—One or two attempts have been 
made to organize some scheme whereby teachers might ex- 
press their opinions regarding the efficiency or lack of it in 
their supervisors but little information can be secured con- 
cerning them. The Spokane, Washington, Grade Teachers 
Association devoted the April, 1921, issue of their bulletin 
to the discussion of supervision and expressed their con- 
fidence and belief in some system of supervisory rating.

While this list is purposely brief, it is suggestive. The 
points, however, must of necessity be more clearly defined 
and limited. Based upon a study of the entire range of 
supervisory activity, students of supervision at Washing- 
ton State College evolved the following list of questions 
which should focus the teachers’ attention directly upon the 
supervisor’s excellence or failure. At the same time it 
focuses attention upon the fact that specific evidence must 
be forthcoming with which to support the judgments 
passed. It is not intended that all the questions shall be 
specifically answered except in crucial cases or emergencies. 
Teachers may, if they wish, rate the supervisors on the main 
headings only, using the questions to organize their think- 
ing, to recall specific occasions, ete. Any of several adapta- 
tions of such a card would be satisfactory. The statements 
may be made direct instead of interrogative. They may be 
reduced in number and weighted if desirable, though little

  434 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
The best illustrations of actual score cards for super- 
visory rating that I have been able to secure are the 
group appended to this chapter on pages 436-442, prepared. 
by students of supervision at the University of Minnesota, 
under direction of Prof. F. L. Whitney. The explanatory 
paragraph preceding the first card is omitted in the others, 
since all are alike. 5 
Administrators Must Have a System of Checks through 
Which They May Judge the Worth of Supervision.—Not 
only should the administrator check up on supervision by 
means of intelligent teacher opinion, but he should have 
also a system of direct checks operated by himself. As 
stated in Chapter I, supervision must some time come to 
be based upon experimentally derived standards, and then 
it may be judged more scientifically. The experiment 
reported by Courtis and referred to in our earlier discus- 
sion indicates that supervision can be measured and its 
worth accurately determined. Other studies in the future       
will undoubtedly furnish more and more data upon which — 
to base conclusions. Meanwhile supervision must be ex- 
amined critically in the light of the best theory and in 
terms of such procedures as can be evaluated and judged 
with reasonable accuracy by administrators or other 
observers. 
By Tests and Measurements.—Supervisors can be judged 
in some of the subjects in much the same way that 
teachers are checked. The application of standard tests 
and measurements to classes that have been under super- 
vision affords a fairly accurate index of the supervisor’s 
services, especially when the scores are checked against 
those of classes that have not been under supervision. 
Care must be taken, of course, to give due weight and 
attention to other factors in the situation, as the previous 
experience of the classes, the make-up of the classes, the 
relative teacher abilities involved, etc.   
-P-A-G-E-457
THE RATING OF SUPERVISORS 435 
By Observations and Records of Supervisory Activities: 
—1. Curriculum building. One of the chief activities of 
the supervisor is to be found in selecting and organizing 
material, especially in the lower grades. Hither alone or 
in conjunction with his teachers he should be constantly 
at work upon the revision of courses of study, upon the 
examination of new texts, upon the organization of 
projects, ete. The written course of study should show 
definite evidence of this activity when examined. New 
material should be manifest, included perhaps on trial 
at first, and later incorporated permanently. Old ma- 
terial unsuited to the grade or no longer of social utility 
should be eliminated. Weekly outlines and programmes 
of lessons from the teachers should be in evidence as indi- 
cations that they are being stimulated by the supervisor 
and are codperating with him in this work of curriculum 
building. 
2. Records of teachers’ meetings, conferences, etc. 
The supervisor should be required to keep a complete 
record of the number of meetings, grade, general, depart- 
mental, ete., held by him during a semester or quarter, 
together with a record of the amount of time used, the 
number of people in attendance, the topics discussed, ete. 
Such records are not necessarily and by themselves indi- 
tations of good supervision, but when checked and com- 
pared with teacher opinion they are a legitimate means of 
determining supervisory efficiency. 
Special attention should be paid to the supervisor’s 
record of room visitations and individual conferences. 
Such activities are the supervisor’s most effective means 
of improving instruction and should occupy the major 
part of his time. The record should show the number of 
visits, the time spent, and the points discussed. If sug- 
gestions or directions are given to the teacher, their 
nature should be outlined in the report. Demonstration 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
    436 SUPERVISION AND TEACHING 
lessons should be very briefly outlined. Devices for use 
in drill, in teaching, and in discipline that are found in 
use by teachers should be passed on to others and due 
eredit given in the report. Copies of supervisory bulletins 
should be filed. 
8. The supervisor’s general plan. It was suggested in 
Chapter XVII that the supervisor should evolve a general 
plan of procedure for the entire semester or quarter, set- 
ting forth the outcomes to be worked for, the means of 
attaining them, and such other points as are indications of 
what is going to be done. This plan in all its detail should 
be scrutinized by the administrator, and at the end of the 
time indicated it should be checked up to see how far the 
objectives have been realized. 
Scorz Carp For GENERAL Supervisory Success 
(Devised by the class in theory of supervision, University of 
Minnesota, College of Education) 
To be used in rating superintendents in small cities, super- 
vising principals of graded or consolidated schools, principals 
of elementary or secondary schools, general supervisors of 
geographical units or of groups of grades in city systems, or 
any general supervisor—but not supervisors of special subjects. 
For use (1) as a self-checking device for self-improvement; (2) 
as a self-checking device for report to the board of education; 
or (3) by administrators in checking results obtained by their 
general supervisors. 
Note the analysis of each division below and check the five- 
point scales in accordance with your best judgment. In sum- 
mating all judgments, these scales may be changed to terms of 
amount by the use of Table 22, pp. 117-121, Thorndike’s Mental 
and Social Measurements. If simply a graphic rating is desired, 
connect the points checked with solid lines.

APPENDIX 
LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 
The lesson plans given below have been selected from 
those turned in by teachers in service and by students in 
normal-school and college classes. The lesson reports are 
abbreviated stenographic records of lessons observed by 
supervisors and by students in training. After each is 
given a brief paragraph of discussion calling attention to 
the features of the lesson and relating it to the theory of 
method outlined in this book. 
It should be emphasized that none of the plans or re- 
ports is to be regarded as perfect or as a model. Many, 
teachers and supervisors on reading them over will note 
errors or opportunities for improvement. In their present 
form, however, they will indicate the type of work with 
which teachers and supervisors will come in contact. Many 
of them should prove very suggestive to the alert teacher 
and assist her in organizing many other lessons.. Normal- 
school students and inexperienced teachers cannot at first 
approximate the better plans here included, but they 
should progress toward such organization under the direc- 
tion of a competent supervisor. 
Supervisors should not expect teachers in service to 
write out such detailed plans. Teachers and supervisors 
in training should be required to write out a number and 
discuss them in class. Beginning teachers should prob- 
ably be asked to write out in some detail a lesson or two 
every week for analysis by ‘the supervisor, and experi- 
enced teachers who manifest a decided weakness with any 
particular type of lesson should also be required to write 
out some plans in detail in order that the supervisor may. 
locate the error in thinking and planning. The supervisor

may also occasionally ask for complete plans or provide 
for a stenographic report in the case of exceptionally good 
lessons that might be used again for demonstrations or 
that might be studied in detail by younger teachers. 
The inclusion of questions and answers is somewhat 
different from the usual method of writing plans, but it 
is much more helpful than the mere statement in general 
terms of the teacher’s procedure. The double-column 
arrangement, subject matter in one, method in the other, 
has also been abandoned, as it is quite confusing to begin- 
ning students and rarely provides for a coherent view of 
either one side or the other.

Specific.—The reduction of fractions to lower terms. 
Analysis of the Aim 
Old Knowledge.—Children have used fractions and know the

one cent is 1/100 of a dollar, how many hundredths in this fifty- 
cent piece? (50/100.) [Writes this on board.] What do we 
usually call a fifty-cent piece, instead of 50/100? (Half a dollar.)

“We do not usually speak of fifty cents as 50/100, or of 
twenty-five cents as 25/100. Why? (Because one-half and one- 
quarter are easier.) Why easier? (Because the terms used are 
smaller.) Yes, we say that the fraction is in lower terms. Al- 
though the two fractions in each case [pointing to board] look 
quite different, you know that their value is the same. 
“Which do you think would be the easier for us to use in our 
work in fractions, large or small fractions, those in higher or 
lower terms?

  [ Then, proceeding as with the circles, the teacher gets from the 
children the following equivalent fractions, adding them to the 
first list:] 
ms ao 
“Now, class, look back to the statement, 4/8=14. How do we 
know that the two fractions are equal? (Because they represent 
the same amount of space on two equal figures.) But can we 
always draw figures and compare spaces when we wish to know 
if fractions are of the same value or not? What must we do? 
Who ean see another way to get 14 when 4/8 is given?” [Some 
pupil may know how to do this, or some bright one may see it 
quickly, but the majority will not, since this is a new process to 
them. The teacher must therefore lead dogmatically for a
-P-A-G-E-469

moment.] “By what must I divide 4 to get 1? Hight to get 2?” 
[Writes on board: 
$+4=4 [Proceeds in the same way with the rest of the list until she 
has the following on the board:

“Tf we had no figures to refer to, who could prove to me that 
4/8 still equals 44, even though we have divided the terms by 
other numbers?” [Some will see that the divisor in each case 
equals 1, or the teacher may lead them to note that fact. They 
know, of course, that numbers divided by one remain of the 
same value.] 
Comparison and Generalization.—‘‘Look back over all these 
fractions and tell me what we did each time.’’ [Teacher should 
probably take most of the individual cases and get the state- 
ment each time that both numerator and denominator were 
divided by 2, 4, 6, or 5, as the case may be. The class should 
finally be guided to make the statement that in each case the 
terms of the fraction were divided by the same number, with 
the result that the larger fraction was made into a smaller one, 
or reduced to lower terms.] 
“What did we start out to find to-day? What was the aim 
for to-day’s lesson? (To learn how to reduce fractions to lower 
terms.) How is it done? (To reduce fractions to lower terms 
divide both terms of the fraction by the same number.)” 
[This process must now be drilled upon until fixed. This will 
involve a number of whole lessons and parts of others.] 
Discussion.—This is a very formal procedure illustrat- 
ing the learning of a generalization or rule and is of the 
type commonly called an inductive lesson. Together with 
the following plan in grammar it is typical of the method 
of learning rules and definitions in the formal subjects. 
Many variations and devices can, of course, be devised by 
good teachers. 
It may be thought that such simple rules should be dog- 
matically given and illustrated. Hcewever, the above pro-

cedure is much more interesting, provides for some self- 
activity, and insures more thorough understanding and 
retention. It does not take as much time as the detailed 
account might indicate and is in the end a time saver. 
‘A GramMar PuAN ILLusrratiING THE LEARNING OF A 
DEFINITION 
\sevsn0n Marrer 
Teacher’s Aim \ 
General.—To teach parts of speech. 
Spetific—To teach the definition of an adverb. 
Analysis of the Aim 
Old Knowledge—Pupils know, and can define, noun, verb, 
adjective, modifier. 
New Knowledge——They will learn that an adverb is a word 
which modifies a verb, adjective, or other adverb.. 
Sources and References 
Any standard grammar. 
\. ‘Merrxop 
“We have learned that words are divided into groups aecording 
to use. What are those groups called? (Parts of speech.) Name 
and define those we have already studied. [Noun, verb, and 
adjective are defined by the class.] What kind of a word did we 
learn that an adjective is? (A modifier.) Define ‘modifier’ (A 
modifier is a word or group of words used with another word to 
qualify or limit its meaning.) 
Pupil’s Aim.—‘‘To-day we are going to study another part 
of speech which is a modifier. 
Presentation.—‘‘ Examine these sentences on the board: 
Group 1 
1. Jack whistled softly, 
2. The poet lives there. 
3. He called twice. 
4, The boat will arrive soon. 
“Read the first sentence. Give the subject. The verb. What 
does ‘softly’ do in this sentence? (Tells how Jack whistled.)
-P-A-G-E-471
f bo 
LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 449 
  Then it tells something about which word? (The verb, ‘whistled.’) 
Then it does what to the verb? (Modifies it.) [Teacher under- 
lines the word ‘softly’.] 
[Proceeds in the same way through the list of sentences.] 
Comparison and Generalization.—‘‘Look at all the underlined 
words. Wherein are the first two alike? How are they all alike? 
What do they all do? (All the underlined words modify verbs.) 
These words have a name which we can substitute for the expres- 
sion ‘all the underlined words.’ It is ‘adverb.’ Now make the 
statement, using the new term. (Adverbs are words which modify 
verbs.) 
“That is not all that adverbs do, however. Let us examine this 
group of sentences: 
Group 2 
1, India is a very warm country. 
2, Ruth has almost four dollars. 
3. It is more beautiful than I thought. 
4, Too many cooks spoil the broth. 
[Analyzes the sentences as in Group 1, underlining in each case 
the word that modifies an adjective. Pupils then add to the first 
statement and say that “adverbs are words which modify verbs or 
adjectives.” 
Group 3 
She sang extremely well. 
. He walked very cautiously. 
Joe writes too slowly. 
. The rock struck far below. Pwr 
[After analyzing this group the class can make a complete 
definition: “Adverbs are words which modify verbs, adjectives, or 
other adverbs.” 
Application—[The teacher may have other groups of sen- 
tences on the board, or the class may open their books to drill 
material in order that practice may be given in selecting adverbs 
and proving that they are adverbs. For instance, in the follow- 
ing sentence:
-P-A-G-E-472
  450 APPENDIX 
1. A bitterly cold wind was blowing. 
An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective, or 
another adverb. “Bitterly” is a word modifying the adjective 
“cold,” telling how cold. Therefore “bitterly” is an adverb.] 
Discussion.—This is another formal plan much like the 
preceding one. There are one or two important features 
to note. First, the type of illustrative sentence used above 
is often severely condemned on the ground that such sen- 
tences are without real content and are not of real interest 
to the class. This is probably true, and the teacher will 
do well to construct lists of simple sentences based upon 
current school events, the pupils’ outside interests, or in- 
teresting stories in reading or history. 
A second point is that some teachers may prefer to 
teach the entire definition by presenting all three classes 
in one long list of sentences. Hither procedure is correct 
and the teacher may select the one she thinks better fitted 
to her class or which she likes the better. 
A Report or Two Lessons In Hyqmne aNnp SANITATION 
These lessons were taught in the fifth grade. The 
method of presentation is partly developmental and 
partly through use of the text. The learning of a general 
truth together with a number of particular facts is illus- 
trated. 
I 
Sussrcr Marrer 
Teacher’s Aim 
General—tTo teach sanitation and hygiene. 
Specific—Facts concerning the spread and control of diseases 
spread by mosquitoes. Malaria and yellow fever. 
Analysis of the Aim 
Old Knowledge—Class had just studied a series of lessons 
based upon those chapters in Ritchie’s Primer of Sanitation which 
deal with bacterial diseases. They know in general about the 
activity of bacteria in the system. The fact that there are proto-
-P-A-G-E-473
LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 451 
zoan germs as well has just been learned and two diseases caused 
by them are to be taken up. 
New Knowledge—Chapters 23 and 24 contain the facts in 
regard to malaria, yellow fever, and mosquitoes, which are to be 
taught. 
Sources and References 
In this case the teacher used Ritchie’s Primer of Sanitation, 
supplemented by reference to encyclopedias and bulletins. Any 
standard references will do but the teacher must make sure to 
be supplied with sufficient information. 
METHOD 
“How many kinds of germs are there? (Two, bacteria and 
protozoa, the first being vegetable and the second animal.) How 
big are they? (Zoo small to see with the eye. A microscope 
must be used.) How do they grow? (By division.) Where are 
they found? (In water, wells, soil, on flies, plants, etc., etc.) 
How do those which are bad for us get into our systems and 
attack us? (In four ways, through the nose, the mouth, sores, or 
by the bite of some insect, fly, mosquito, some kinds of beetles.) 
Why are they dangerous? (Because they manufacture toxins or 
poisons in the blood and body.) Name some of the diseases that 
we have studied that were caused by germs? [Long list named 
and salient points given from previous study.] 
“These diseases that we have studied were all caused by bac- 
teria. We will now study one caused by a protozoa. Who has 
heard of malaria? [Let children make such statements as they 
will.] Do you know what causes it? [Some will say, of course, 
a germ, and this answer can be disposed of by asking how the 
germ causes it. Other answers will relate to popular superstitions 
in regard to bad air, bad drinking water, ete. By rejecting these 
latter reasons for the disease the teacher is enabled to introduce 
the aim.] 
Pupil’s Aim.—‘‘ To-day we are going to find out how malarial 
fever is caused. 
Presentation.—‘‘Tell me of the two organisms that are found 
in our blood. [Pupils give full discussions in regard to white 
and red corpuscles. The white ones are likened to policemen, 
since they guard and fight against germs. The red ones, on the 
other hand, are carriers of oxygen, color, etc., through the 
blood.]
-P-A-G-E-474
| 
452 _ APPENDIX 
“The protozoa, or germ would then attack which of these, and 
why? (The red corpuscle, since it does not fight.) Yes, they 
enter the red corpuscles and then what happens? [Children 
do not know.] Open your books to page 103, look at Figure 70 
and read the paragraph opposite. Who can tell me what happens? 
[Children relate how the germ grows and divides until it breaks 
the corpuscle, throwing poison and new germs into the blood to 
repeat the process. ] 
“How do you suppose that a person with malarial fever would 
feel? [Remembering the work and effect of the red corpuscles, 
the pupils can tell that a person would feel tired, lazy, ‘done 
up.’] 
“This disease used to be quite prevalent, even in the temperate 
zones. Does anyone know in what kind of places it is usually 
found? (Low, wet, swampy places.) 
“What insect pest have you found in such places? (Mosqui- 
toes.) Where else besides in swamps? (Ponds, sloughs, stagnant 
water of any kind.) Yes, and in places closer home than those. 
Have you ever looked in a rain barrel? What were some of the , 
things you found? What are those wrigglers in the water? 
[Only a very few of the class knew that they would turn into 
mosquitoes.] Open your books to page 110, look at Figures 76 
and 77, reading the paragraph headed, ‘Life History of the 
Mosquito.’ [This paragraph was reproduced and discussed after 
a few minutes’ study.] 
“A long time ago there was a certain section in Italy where the 
people suffered terribly from malaria. There was a great swamp 
all around there and some English scientists thought there might 
be some connection between the disease and the mosquitoes. 
Would you like to know what they found out? Open your books 
to page 105 and read the paragraph headed, ‘Malaria Spread 
Only by Mosquitoes.’ Read until you are able to tell me how it 
was proved that the mosquito spreads malaria. [Pupils read and 
then tell the story of how the scientists lived in the region, 
breathed the supposedly bad air, drank the water, and otherwise 
lived the life of the people there, except that they carefully 
sereened themselves from the mosquitoes. They did not develop 
the disease. They then sent mosquitoes that had bitten malaria 
patients, to England, People bitten by these mosquitoes, though 
living in far away England, developed the disease. ] 
“Would you not like to know how the bite of the mosquito 
causes malaria? Read on page 104 the paragraph, ‘How the
-P-A-G-E-475
  LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 453 
Malaria Germ Gets into the Body.’ [Pupils read and tell how the 
mosquito injects saliva when it bites so that the blood will be 
thinned enough to take up. Biting a person infected with the 
fever results in germs passing into the mosquito where they 
multiply in little sacs outside the stomach wall. The same process 
takes place in the mosquito as takes place in man. The fever 
toxin is mixed with saliva and injected into the next person 
bitten.] 
“Not all mosquitoes will give you malaria, however. Would 
you not like to be able to identify the dangerous one? Open 
your books to page 111 and read the paragraph, ‘Anopheles,’ 
examining carefully Figure 78 on page 112. [Pupils are then 
asked to describe the anopheles mosquito which spreads the dis- 
ease. The description should include habits, breeding places, etc., 
as well as appearance. Too long to reproduce here.] 
“What did we start out to find to-day? (How malarial fever 
is caused.) Have we found out?’ [Children then organized the 
following summary on the board.] 
1. Regions where malaria is found. 
2. The malaria germ: 
(a) How it gets into the body. 
(b) Its effect upon the blood and the reaction on the 
patient. 
3. The life history of a mosquito. 
(a) Description of the anopheles mosquito. 
4, Proof of the lesson in the story of the English scientists.

Mernop 
[The previous day’s work on malaria was briefly reviewed. 
Pupils were asked to tell how malaria is caused by the bite of 
the mosquito, how it was proved that the mosquito was the carrier, 
where the disease is found, etc.] 
“To-day we are going to study another disease caused by a 
protozoa. This type of germ attacks what in the blood? (Red 
corpuscles.) How do you think the weakening and loss of red 
corpuscles will make the person’s skin look? (White, gray, 
sallow, yellow.) Yes, and it is from this that the disease we are 
to study gets its name, yellow fever. 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
    454 APPENDIX 
Pupil’s Aim.—‘‘To-day we are going to find out how yellow 
fever is caused. 
Presentation.—‘‘The toxin these germs give out is a deadly 
poison. How do you suppose that affects the sick person as it 
inereases in the blood? (They must suffer much pain; have 
severe fever; be very sick with nausea and vomiting; perhaps 
delirious; often result in death.) Yes, that is true. It is a very 
severe disease and used to kill many people during epidemics. 
That stimulated men to study the disease in order to understand 
it and attempt to control it. 
[The textbook has no information at this point, so the teacher 
supplies the following brief statement dogmatically, taking it 
from encyclopedias and bulletins. If other references are avail- 
able, pupils should be asked to read the material and report.] 
“This disease used to be prevalent in tropic regions and in some 
temperate ones, usually in the summer season. Some scientists 
noted the prevalence of mosquitoes and suspected, as in the case 
of malaria, that there might be some connection. An opportunity 
came to try out their theory during the epidemic of 1905 in Cuba. 
Only seven men responded to the call for volunteers because fear 
of the disease was so great. These men built a mosquito-proof 
house in the infected district and then sent for bedclothes and 
nightgowns that had been used by people who had died of the 
disease. These clothes were used but no one contracted the dis- 
ease. 
“The next thing was to experiment with the mosquito as in the 
ease of malaria. The seven men allowed infected mosquitoes to 
bite them, with the result that six became ill, three of them dying. 
One did not take it. Why do you suppose he did not? [Develop 
the fact that some people are immune through antitoxin in the 
blood that enables them to resist. Recall of this fact can be made 
later in introducing serums and vaccines to the class.] 
“Open your books to page 115 and examine the picture of the 
mosquito that does the damage. [Pupils describe it and teacher 
furnishes further information that, once infected, the insect is 
always infected, transmitting the infection to the next generation. 
An infected person must be bitten within three days after devel- 
oping the disease in order to infect the mosquito, since the infec- 
tious element is only present in the blood that long.] 
“What did we start out to find to-day?” (How yellow fever is 
caused.) [Pupils then organized a brief summary on the board.] 
1. Regions where yellow fever is found.
-P-A-G-E-477
LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 455 
2. The name and description of the mosquito (stegomyia) that 
causes it. 
3. How it was discovered that the mosquito was the carrier. 
Comparison.—‘‘ Recalling what we learned about malaria 
yesterday, let us see if we can find points wherein malaria and 
yellow fever are alike.” 
1. Both are fevers. 
2. Both are caused by a protozoa that attacks the red corpuscles. 
3. Both are spread by mosquitoes. 
4. They are not contagious. 
Generalization.—‘‘ What great truth did men learn from all 
this? (That these diseases are spread by mosquitoes and are not 
contagious.) 
Application.—‘‘ What good does this do us? What should we 
do about it? (Attempt to destroy mosquitoes by destroying their 
breeding places.) Does anyone know how this can be done? 
[Some pupils may know or can figure out some way to do it, and 
if so, should discuss with the class. Otherwise the teacher makes 
the following assignment.] Read pages 113 to 116 in the book 
and make a list of all the breeding places; a list of the ways of 
destroying mosquitoes; a list of those places that have suecess- 
fully fought this pest. 
“The book merely mentions those places that have fought the 
mosquitoes. Do any of you know of famous and successful fights 
against them? [Some pupil may know of the Panama Canal 
Zone case, and if so should tell what he knows.] 
[Motivation is here provided for a language lesson in which 
letters can be written for government bulletins or other pam- 
phlets supplied by state and Federal health bureaus. Other 
assignments should be made to histories and readers of the later 
type that carry accounts of this disease-prevention work.] 
“What shall we do where mosquitoes are not yet stamped out 
and where the diseases are likely to occur? Read pages 107 to 
109 and list the methods ta preventing malaria; of preventing 
yellow fever. 
“What can we learn at the example set by the scientists who 
risked and gave their lives to find out about these diseases?” 
[The teacher should lead a discussion of this type of heroism and 
bravery, comparing it with the common and inadequate idea of 
bravery. The courage and attitude of the men together with the 
tremendous service to mankind should be stressed. This discus- 
sion should serve as a motivation for many other lessons in his- 
   
-P-A-G-E-478
456 APPENDIX 
tory, geography, and reading. The later books now include dis- 
eussions of such things and many story accounts of brave deeds 
other than those of the battlefield can be found.] 
Discussion.—This lesson illustrates the use of the in- 
ductive method with rich content material. The ability to 
organize and teach such lessons is indicative of real skill 
in teaching. 
The presentation is pa rtly by the developmental method 
and partly through use of the text. This use of the text 
is quite typical of much work that should be done in the 
content subjects, history, geography, etc. In this case 
only one text was used, that being the only one available. 
Where other books, magn, pamphlets, ete., are on 
hand, the teacher should introduce them freely in the man- 
ner indicated. Many teachers call lessons involving the 
use of text material during recitation, ‘‘supervised study’’ 
lessons. Under one definition of supervised study this is 
legitimate. 
The above work, with the exception of that outlined in 
the application step, was covered in this instance in two 
periods, but this organization can obviously be varied by, 
teachers to suit the particular needs of any situation. 
Some teachers may feel that too much time has been put 
upon subject matter that i only applicable to a few parts 
of the country. The material is of enough value his- 
torically, however, and gives such an important attitude 
and viewpoint on diseas

tion by means of reviewing the following circumstances: (1) 
Arnold’s treachery, (2) Charles Lee’s disobedience, (3) Aaron 
Burr’s conspiracy. 
Analysis of the Aim 
Old Knowledge.—The following brief paragraphs summarize 
the facts the pupils know about each case: 
1. Benedict Arnold won a reputation for bravery and skill in 
the Revolutionary War, but because of some irregularity in 
his life at Philadelphia, he was court-martialed and punished by 
being reprimanded by Washington. Later he was given command 
of West Point and in a spirit of revenge began negotiations with 
Clinton for surrendering the plans of this fort to the enemy. 
The plot became known, and though Arnold escaped, his accom-~ 
plice, Major André, was captured, convicted on the testimony 
of three men, and hanged. Arnold fled to England but was 
despised by the English and remained an outeast all his life. 
2. Part of Washington’s army was under Charles Lee. On one 
oceasion Lee was ordered to join Washington and refused, caus- 
ing Washington to retreat or be captured. Again, when 
Washington was about to win a victory at Monmouth, Lee ordered 
a retreat, resulting in a defeat and rout. He was ordered to the 
rear, later court-martialed, and dismissed from the army. He 
was not convicted because of lack of evidence but suffered dis- 
charge from the army and disgrace in the eyes of his countrymen. 
Papers were found eighty years later that would have convicted 
him. 
3. Aaron Burr was Vice-President during Jefferson’s adminis- 
tration and was a man of wealth and influence. He fought a 
duel with Alexander Hamilton, killing him, thereby losing much 
of his popularity and position. He fled to New Orleans for 
safety and there organized a military expedition that was to form 
a@ new government in the Southwest. Such a plan would have 
threatened the Union and was therefore regarded as disloyal. 
‘Aaron Burr was tried in court but was not convicted for lack of 
evidence. His disgrace was now complete. [Some of the later 
histories state that no one really knows what Burr was going to 
do and that he may have had no disloyal intentions. Pupils 
should discuss the conflicting evidence if it is found in their 
books. ] 
New Knowledge.—Section III of Article III of the Constitu- 
tion, defining treason and determining the method of fixing 
punishment.

“Some time ago you learned a selection beginning: z 
‘Breathes there a man with soul so dead,’ 
“I see you recall it. Who will repeat it for the class? Who 
is the author? What is the sentiment expressed? (Patriotism.) 
Rather the need for patriotism. Do you remember another author 
who was inspired by this stanza and based a story on the theme? 
(Hale, The Man Without a Country.) Who will give a very brief 
synopsis of this story? Does the story suggest any parallel case 
in history, that is, of a man turning against his country for a 
seeming wrong done him and then of his regret for his disloyalty? 
[Pupils mention Benedict Arnold, Charles Lee, and Aaron Burr.] 
Pupil’s Aim.—‘‘To-day we will examine the cases of Arnold, 
Lee, and Burr to see wherein these men were disloyal. 
Presentation—[In answer to questions from the teacher, the 
pupils state the principal points in the three cases, much as 
outlined above on the subject-matter side of this plan. The 
following summary was then organized on the board.] 
BENEDIOT ARNOLD 
1. Offense. Aiding the enemy. r 
2. Result. Found out and fled to England. Could have been con- 
vieted, as there were witnesses and evidence. 
3. Fate. An outcast from his own country. Scorned by many of the 
English. Died in poverty in England.

Comparison and Generalization.—‘‘ Make a statement showing 
wherein these cases were alike. [Boil down to something like 
the following, ‘All aided the enemy or levied war, all were found 
out, and all suffered punishment.’] 
“Now I am going to give you a word that means the commission 
of these two crimes against one’s country. It is ‘treason.’ [Word 
is known, of course, in general but not exactly.] Define treason 
in terms of the cases studied. (Treason consists in aiding the 
enemy or levying war on one’s country.) 
“You say that all these men were punished. Do you mean 
legally punished? (No, they escaped because of lack of evidence 
and witnesses. In one case by flight.) Do you think we should 
insist on witnesses and complete evidence in the case of such a 
serious crime? [Some may think not, having their minds on the 
act against the country. Others will see that because of the 
seriousness it is well to insist on such safeguards. If they do not 
see it, teacher can easily develop.] 
“What else shows this to be a serious crime? (The way in 
which everyone scorned those suspected, even when not con- 
wicted.) 
“What do you think should be the punishment? [Most of class 
will probably say ‘death.’] 
“Open your books and read Section III of Article III of the 
Constitution and see if our idea of treason is correct. Wherein 
were we right? (In the type of offenses included, and in insisting 
on witnesses and evidence.) Wherein do we differ?” (In the kind 
of punishment.) [Teacher will have to explain carefully the 
phrases, ‘attainder of treason’ and ‘corruption of blood,’ which 
are contained in the section.] 
Discussion.—It should not be thought that this elab- 
orate plan is merely to introduce the brief paragraph on 
treason. An equally important aim is to review material 
from the history course. The organization of such reviews 
in which old material is retaught, or used in a new way, 
is usually indicative of considerable skill in the handling . 
of subject matter. : ‘ 
The outline of subject matter is more elaborate than in 
the preceding plans and is typical of what must sometimes 
be required of teachers who are weak in knowledge of the 
actual facts they are to teach.

would not be in sympathy with the colonists and perhaps would 
not feel the responsibility that local rulers would.) What other 
things did the mother country do that added to the colonists’ 
difficulties? (Taxes. No representation.) 
“How did the people feel about all this? What did they do 
about it? In order to rebel successfully they united. What other 
 
-P-A-G-E-483
LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 461 
things did they have to do to maintain their unity and fight suc- 
cessfully? [A number of things will be mentioned, among them 
the one the teacher wants—select a leader.] What would they 
look for in a leader? (Honesty, bravery, perseverance, trust- 
worthiness, ability to manage, etc., etc.) And who was the man 
they selected? What name did they give him later? (Zhe Father 
of his Country.) 
Presentation—‘‘In far off Switzerland there once lived a 
great leader who was also called ‘The Father of his Country.’ 
‘Would you not like to know how he came to have the same title 
as our own George Washington? 
Pupil’s Aim.—‘‘We are going to find out how William Tell 
became ‘The Father of his Country.’ 
[Note.—In lessons of this type one aim for the entire story is 
set up as above and then sub-aims, key sentences, unit sentences, 
or topic sentences, as they are variously called, are set up for the 
smaller thought units. In this case the sub-aims are: 
1. We will see how conditions in Switzerland and in the colonies 
were alike. 
2. How the revolt was planned. 
3. How William Tell defied the tyrant. 
4, How William Tell escaped from the tyrant. 
5. How Switzerland was freed. : 
6. What William Tell means to the Swiss people.   
The first unit only is presented here. See discussion at close 
of lesson for further information on this type of procedure.] 
“Look at this map of Switzerland. Can you determine any- 
thing from it that would present to the Swiss one of the diffi- 
culties of our colonists? (Zhe mountains would make transporta- 
tion and communication very difficult. Much more so than in our 
country.) What other difficulty would confront these people 
because of the many big mountains? (Little land suited to agri- 
culture, and thus living would be difficult.) 
“Now this country once belonged to another country, Austria. 
They sent out governors much as England did to this country 
and you may imagine that they were as unsatisfactory.” [Pupils 
ean, of course, figure out that, in general, the oppression and 
tyranny might be the same but they will have to read in order 
to determine the exact and specific tyrannies and oppressions. 
They are therefore referred to the proper page in a good history 
reader. They are then called upon to reproduce what has been 
read in class or studied outside.] 
The other units of the story are presented in the same way.

462 APPENDIX 
Discussion.—This lesson illustrates very well the pro- 
eedure in teaching historical, legendary, or biographical 
tales, stories of adventure, invention, ete. A number of 
variations is possible. When time permits, the develop- 
mental method should be used wherever possible, the book 
being resorted to only for those facts which cannot be 
brought out by discussion. If time is short, the sub-aims 
and study questions can be quickly presented and placed 
upon the board. The class is then referred to the book, 
either to read and reproduce at once, or to study outside 
and report during the following lesson. 
The use of the textbook shown in the lessons on mosqui- 
toes, in this lesson, and in the following one on Daniel 
Boone, illustrates a good technique in silent reading. 
Pupils are trained to read in answer to questions, to or- 
ganize, to interpret the matter on the page, etc. 
Such stories as William Tell, Robin Hood, and the like 
furnish excellent material for dramatization. After the 
stories have been developed or read, the class may be set 
to working out their presentation. Scenes must be organ- 
ized, the conversation worked out, stage setting and cos- 
tumes prepared, and the play presented. Preferably an 
audience should be invited. Obviously much work in com- 
position, oral and written, in drawing, in construction, 
ete., is motivated. 
The sub-aims used in such stories may be given by the 
teacher, or they may be evolved by the class after the unit 
has been developed or told. They come first if the ma- 
terial must be read by the class. 
Report or History Story Lesson 
This lesson illustrates the developmental method of 
presentation. Because of space, much of the discussion 
has been abbreviated or merely indicated. The skillful 
teacher can stimulate and guide interesting and helpful 
discussions on many points indicated. Such discussions 
afford opportunity for imagination and thinking and build 
up an interest that can be used in motivating reading.

General—tTo teach history stories. 
Specific—To develop the story of Daniel Boone.

Old Knowledge-——General knowledge of colonial and pioneer 
conditions. Many of the facts will be vague in the pupils’ minds 
and one result of the lesson will be to clarify and correct them. 
New Knowledge—Story of Daniel Boone.

“What part of our country was first settled? Why not this 
section sooner than it was? [Pointing to map west of Alle- 
ghenies.] (Mountains were a barrier. Plenty of land east of 
them for a long time.) What kind of country lay beyond the 
mountains? (Wild, unexplored, dangerous.) What were some 
of the dangers you might expect explorers to meet there? (In- 
dians, wild beasts, accidents due to lack of roads, etc.) Were 
there any attractions? (Fertile land in some valleys for farmers. 
Plenty of game for hunters.) What kind of people would want 
to go to land like this? (Brave, adventurous.) Does anyone 
know of a famous man who did cross the mountains into Ken- 
tucky? (Daniel Boone.) 
Pupil’s Aim.—‘‘Let us find how Daniel Boone became the 
‘Hero of Kentucky.’ We cannot find out all about Daniel Boone 
to-day, or even this week. What are some of the many things 
we will have to discover in order to know why he was the hero of 
Kentucky? (Why he went to Kentucky. What he did there. 
How he fought the Indians. How he was able to do the things he 
did. How he was able to lead the hard life of a new settler 
successfully. If he made a settlement himself. Etc., etc.) 
“Let us begin at the beginning by finding how his early life 
fitted him to be an explorer. 
Sub-aim for Unit 1—How Daniel Boone’s early life prepared 
him to be an explorer. 
“How did people live in colonial days? What were some of

their occupations? What sort of homes did they have? (Wealthy 
people had mansions, while the poorer people had log cabins.) 
Daniel Boone’s father was a hunter. Where would you expect 
them to live? (In a cabin near the woods.) How might it be 
furnished? What things would you expect to see in a hunter’s 
cabin? [Details of furniture, heating, lighting, clothing, pre- 
paring food, ete., may be discussed.] How might a boy who lived 
in this sort of home amuse himself? (Play in woods. Make pets 
of animals. Hunt with father.) Yes, he even took long hunts 
alone. What would he learn on these trips? (About kinds of 
trees and plants; things to eat in forest; how to tell directions; 
how to track animals and to imitate their calls; to be a good shot, 
etc., etc.) [Some pupil may state that he would learn how to 
fight or avoid Indians. The teacher should then state that most 
of the Indians were friendly and ask what Daniel Boone might 
learn from them as he hunted or talked with them.] (He would 
learn more about the woods, about tracking and stalking, how to 
move silently through the forest, and about the habits of the 
Indians.) How would all this be valuable to an explorer? How 
else would this life help him? (Develop a strong body, keep him 
healthy and fit, able to endure for long periods without food or 
rest.) 
“As population became more dense how would things change 
around Boone’s home? (Land would be cleared for farming, 
game would become scarce.) Would the hunters like this?) What 
would they be likely to do? (Move to a new home.) Yes, 
Daniel Boone’s father took his family to a new home in North 
Carolina, on the Yadkin River. [Locate on map.] How would 
they travel to the new home? [Class discusses difficulties of 
travel through new country.] What things would they be likely 
to take with them? What would be the first thing to do when 
they arrived? (Build and furnish cabin.) Yes, and it was not 
long after this that Daniel decided to build a cabin for himself. 
What do you think he was planning to do? (Get married.) 
“How would this journey to North Carolina help to prepare 
Boone to be an explorer? (Would give him familiarity with the 
difficulties of travel in a new country, teach him how to travel 
with the least possible baggage, how to support himself while on 
the way. He would also learn how to build a new cabin and 
establish a new home.) 
“As time went on the same thing happened in the new home 
that had happened in the old one in Pennsylvania and the Boones

decided to move again. This time Daniel Boone decided to strike 
out for himself into the new country west of the Alleghenies. 
What did we start out to find to-day? (How Daniel Boone’s 
early life prepared him to be an explorer.) Let us summarize 
what we have found: 
“Daniel Boone learned: 
1. Much forest lore. 
[Knowledge of trees and plants. Habits of birds and 
animals. How to tell directions.] 
2. How to get food in the forest. 
[The stalking, killing and preparation of game. The mak- 
ing of fishing tackle, the repair of guns and tools, The 
use of berries, roots, and other edible plants.) 
3. How to get along with the Indians. 
[How to live with them and profit by the knowledge. How- 
to fight and outwit them if necessary. How to move silently 
through the forest. How to imitate birds and animals.] 
4, How to travel through new country. 
[Making and carrying of a pack. How to use horses where 
there are few roads. Clothing and equipment.] 
5. How to make a new home. 
[Clearing of the land and building the cabin.] 
6. How to be brave and self-reliant, and to keep in good 
physical condition.” 
* * * * * 
Sub-aim for Unit 2.—“To-day we will find out how Daniel 
Boone prepared for his journey into Kentucky. 
“Do you think Boone would go alone on this journey? How 
large a party? [If some pupils think that a large party would 
be best in order to make a settlement, others will be able to 
answer this by showing that this was an exploration and there- 
fore a small, quick-moving, easily fed and defended party would 
be best.] Would he take his wife? (No, would prefer men 
only.) Yes, he did, and he chose five hunters to go with him. 
“What kind of a country did we say this was? (Wild, unex- 
plored and dangerous. No stores, roads, houses, or white people. 
Indians and wild beasts would be met with.) Then what must 
they be prepared to do? (Fell trees, cross streams, find and pre- 
pare their food, kill wild beasts, fight Indians.) 
“What will be some of the things they will need to take along? 
(Guns and ammunition. Knives and tomahawks. Hatchets and 
other small tools.) Yes, despite their weight, these things must 
be carried.
-P-A-G-E-488
466 APPENDIX | 
“How will they carry these and other things that will be neces- 
sary? (Horses and wagons were probably not used because of 
rough country. Must therefore carry belongings in packs on their 
backs.) 
“How would these men be clothed? [Homespun suggested by 
some and rejected by other pupils because it would not wear. 
Bear-skin suggested because of warmth and rejected because of 
weight and cumbersomeness. Buckskin finally chosen because of 
light weight and durability. Teacher corroborates the correct- 
ness of their inference.] What would they wear on their feet? 
{Heavy boots suggested but rejected because of weight, difficulty 
of repair or replacement. Mocassins agreed upon. Coonskin 
eaps were discussed.] Would they carry much extra clothing? 
[Decide little or none, since what they have can be repaired in 
the woods. ] 
“How would the party shelter themselves at night and during 
storms? [Tents are suggested but rejected because of inability 
to carry them. Must get under trees, in caves or go without 
shelter.] Will they be able to stand this exposure? (Yes, all are 
hardy men trained in the forest.) 
“Would they carry any food with them? [This question usu- 
ally starts considerable discussion in the class. Some pupils will 
insist that certain foods must be carried while others will think 
the party must rely on the woods and streams. As a matter of 
fact the party carried practically no provisions with them. The 
discussion can be led to that conclusion by the teacher when it 
has gone as far as it profitably can.] 
“What did we start out to find to-day? (How Daniel Boone 
prepared for his journey into Kentucky.) Let us summarize 
what we have found.” [An outline summary is worked out upon 
the board as was done at the end of the first unit.]

[The story is then continued until the following units have been 
worked out: 
1. How Daniel Boone’s early life prepared him to be an explorer. 
2. How he prepared for his journey into Kentucky. 
3. The experiences and adventures on this trip. 
(a) The adventures on the trip. 
(6) The new land they found.

Discussion.—These two lessons illustrate rather well the 
developmental method of presentation in which the events 
of a story are inferred by stimulating the pupils to use 
their imaginations and build upon their own knowledge. 
In some places, of course, the book must be used to get 
: facts that cannot be inferred, but it is remarkable how 
| much can be developed by a skillful teacher. 
| After the story has been developed it can be read in 
) class, as there will be sufficient additional information to 
guarantee interest, or it may be read outside at the option 
of individual pupils. Dramatizations can be organized. 
Imagination should be supplemented at every turn by, 
the teacher through use of many pictures of frontiersmen, 
their weapons, costumes, tools, pictures of Indians, of 
hunting, of early settlements, log cabins, forts, ete. Inter- 
esting information can also be contributed to the lesson by, 
the teacher if she is careful not to become a lecturer. For 
instance, Roosevelt’s Winning of the West has much inter- 
esting material that can be adapted. Pupils can be stim- 
ulated to read other stories of like nature. 
Sub-points should be worked out for each unit as illus- 
trated in the first and third. The above arrangement of 
units may not suit all teachers and it should be varied to 
suit individual preferences.

“T am going to show you two pictures. Tell me which one you 
like the better? Why do you like that one? (Because it is 
clearer, has colors, looks like summer, etc.) Yes, it is the clearer 
of the two. Is there any other way in which we may make 
pictures, other than with paint or crayon as here? [Several ways 
will be mentioned including the one wanted—we may make pic- 
tures with words.] Who will make a picture with words for us? 
[Pupils deseribe things or scenes of interest to the class and the 
varying degrees of clearness are discussed.] 
Presentation.—‘ ‘Now look at this paragraph upon the board. 
Grendel’s grandmother was a monster. She lived in a cave 
at the bottom of a pool. To reach this cave Beowulf had to go 
through the waters, among the reeds, and over quicksands. 
Tell me if you see a very clear picture? How does the monster 
look to you? Do you see the cave? The pool? (No, it does not 
give us a very clear picture.) Who sees how we can make this 
picture clearer, or better? What would you add to this in order 
to get a better picture? [Pupils then suggested words, ‘slimy’ 
and ‘horrible’ to go with ‘monster.’] Yes, that gives a better pic- 
ture of the monster. [In like manner words ‘immense’ and ‘black’ 
were supplied to go with ‘pool.’ Words ‘dark’ and ‘dirty’ to go 
with ‘cave,’ ‘thick’ and ‘slimy’ to go with ‘reeds,’ and ‘treacherous’ 
to go with ‘quicksands.’] 
“Now read the paragraph with these new words written in. 
Does that give us a better picture than we had before? 
Comparison.—‘‘ What does each word do for us? What do 
all the words do? Look at each one and get the picture called up 
by it and then tell me what all of them do for you. 
Generalization—(All these words make the picture much 
clearer.) Then what might we call these words? They might be 
called picture words. We will call them by that name, and I 
want you to tell me again what they do, using the new name. 
(Picture words are words that make the picture clearer.)

Application.—‘‘Now I will give you some sentences and you 
may put in picture words to make it clearer. [On board.] ‘One 
morning I was walking through the fields.’ That does not make 
a very clear or pretty picture. Who can make it better? [Words 
‘bright’ and ‘sunny’ were supplied to go with ‘morning,’ and 
‘beautiful green’ to go with ‘fields.’ One or two other sentences 
were used in like manner. Pupils were asked to bring to class 
to-morrow lists of picture words that would go with the words, 
‘elouds,’ ‘day,’ and ‘birds.’] 
A GzocrapHy Lesson ILLustratiING THE PROBLEM-SOLVING 
PROCESS 
The subject-matter side is written out in some detail to 
illustrate how the brief summary in the usual textbook 
must be supplemented. Good geography teaching neces- 
sitates much use of encyclopedias, bulletins, magazines, 
books, ete. 
It should be emphasized here that teachers do not or- 
dinarily write out such detailed summaries of material. 
‘A few notes will usually serve to keep it in mind. How- 
ever, if a teacher is consistently careless about preparing 
material or is frequently at a loss for information while 
before her class, the supervisor must then insist on a few 
such detailed summaries until the difficulty is overcome. 
Supsect Marrer 
Teacher’s Aim 
General.—tTo teach the South American countries. 
Specific—To teach Paraguay. 
Analysis of the Aim e 
Old Knowledge.—Information about zone boundaries, wind 
system, rainfall distribution, ete. 
New Knowledge.—The following is the content of the lesson: 
1. Location—Paraguay is an inland country lying between 22 
and 27 degrees South latitude, and bordered by Bolivia, Brazil, 
and Argentina. 
2. Surface—tThe surface is rolling and hilly, varying in alti- 
tude from 200 feet to a few ranges of 1,500 feet. The soil is very 
rich. The Paraguay River passes almost through the middle of 
the country from north to south, joining the Paranda River at the 
 
-P-A-G-E-492
  470 APPENDIX 
southern boundary. It has numerous important tributaries, and 
there are many other small streams and ereeks, some of which 
broaden out into impenetrable swamps. 
3. Climate.—It has a tropical climate. Roughly the country lies 
in the horse latitudes in fall and spring, there being little rain 
during those times. During the summer (our winter) it would 
lie in the Southeast Trade Wind Belt, and thus have considerable 
rain. In the winter (our summer) it would be in the path of the 
prevailing westerlies and there would be little rain. 
4. Vegetation—The country is highly favored by nature as a 
productive region. On the hillsides of the eastern part of the 
country there are dense forests containing over one hundred kinds 
of trees. These forests cover about one-half the total area. 
Much very valuable timber is eut, many essences, oils and spices, 
barks are also obtained. The western part is a broad meadow- 
land where hay and grain are raised and where there is much 
pasturage. 
Orange trees grow wild in the forests. Yerba maté is also a 
natural product growing without cultivation in the forests. 
5. Products—The forest produces: dye-woods, valuable tim- 
ber, gums, indigo, India-rubber, oranges, tannin, medicines, yerba 
maté. The cultivated products are: sugar-cane, tobacco, rice, 
mandioca, maize and corn, cotton of a very superior kind, grapes, 
oranges. Products of the meadows and pastures: hay and grain, 
cattle, horses, meats, ete. There are practically no mineral prod- 
ucts at present but late reports indicate considerable mineral 
wealth in the country. 
6. Industries—A long series of wars, together with the poor 
type of labor available, has greatly hampered industry. 
(a) Herding—Cattle raising is the leading industry and while 
it brings in much wealth now, it is capable of great development 
when transportation facilities are bettered and when refrigeration 
and packing plants are established. American capital 1s engaged 
in the latter enterprise. 
(b) Agriculture-—The government is encouraging agriculture 
to the best of its ability. It is also attracting colonists and several 
new settlements have been established with people from Europe 
and Australia. 
Much more cotton would be raised if there was a better labor 
supply and if there were factories nearby. Foreign freight rates 
are also very high. 
Conditions are ideal for the production of much rice, by means 
 
-P-A-G-E-493
LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 471 
of irrigation. The government is interested and is importing 
Japanese experts to study the problem. At present much rice is 
imported. Lumbering is extensive and brings in much wealth. 
Tobacco is exported to Argentina and to Europe. The govern- 
ment is also encouraging this industry, which suffered much from 
the wars. 
(c) Manufacturing is somewhat undeveloped. Much of it is 
the preparation of raw material for shipment to factories in for- 
eign countries. There is manufacture of oils, essences, soap, 
spirits, cigars, bricks and earthenware, some furniture, lace 
making (a remnant of Spanish days.) 
(ad) Transportation and Commerce.—There is a good harbor 
for river boats at Asuncion. Light boats can go up the tribu- 
taries also. 
There are four important wagon roads from the interior to 
Asuncion, and some miles of railroad, the most important being 
that between Asuncion and Montevideo. 
The chief exports are the things mentioned above under 
products and those in this section under industries. 
Imports consist of clothing, machinery, cutlery, tools, arms, ete. 
7. Cities—Asuncion is the principal city and need not be 
taught in detail, since some other more important South American 
city should be presented in detail as a type. 
8. People and Government.—The people are Indians, Spanish, 
half-breeds, and a few Europeans. Their life, customs, costumes, 
ete., should be given in some little detail through reading. The 
government is of the usual South American republic type.

Approach.—‘‘How many of you have had friends move away 
. from here to make their home somewhere else? Did they go to 
another part of this country or to a foreign country? Did you 
hear them discuss why they left? What did they say? [Discus- 
sion by class. Usual reasons will be lack of work, closing of mill 
or factory, father transferred to another office, climate does not 
agree with some of the family, to get better schools, ete., etc.] 
“What did they say about the new place to which they were 
going? Why was it chosen? How did they find out about this 
place? [Let class give such discussion as they wish.]
-P-A-G-E-494
  472 APPENDIX 
“If people were moving to a far away foreign country they — 
would have to be all the more particular in finding out about it. 
What are some of the things you or your parents would want to — 
know about a country before going there? (Could we make a 
living? What businesses are carried on there? What kind of 
people would we have to live among? Is the country safe and 
healthful? Are there good schools? Is the climate favorable? 
etc., etc.) | 
“Let us organize an outline of the topics upon which inquiry 
would be made. [From informal discussion the teacher will 
organize on the board some such outline as the following.] 
Things to find out about a new country: 
Products 
Industries 
People 
Government 
Cities and schools 
Climate 
Transportation 
[Others may be suggested.] 
The list of topics may be organized on the board in any 
order, depending on the trend of class discussion. In 
teaching them, however, though there are several that 
might come first, a few should be studied in sequence. For 
instance, if the pupils decide to study products before 
climate and surface, they can be very easily led to see that 
the former depends upon the two latter. 
“Let us suppose we are going to move to Paraguay.” 
Pupils’ Aim.—‘‘Let us find out if Paraguay would be a good 
place to make a home. 
Sub-aim for Unit 1—“Let us see if Paraguay has a desirable 
climate. 
Inspection and Inference.—‘‘Step to the map and locate Para- 
guay for the class. (It lies between 22 and 27 degrees South 
latitude, and is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn.) What does 
that tell you? (That it lies partly in the Torrid and partly in 
the South Temperate Zone, and, other things being equal, it 
would have a tropical climate.) 
“What other facts can you tell from the latitude in regard to
-P-A-G-E-495
  LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 473 
the climate? (That in the fall and spring the country will lie in 
the Horse Latitudes and that there will be little rain.) 
“What else? (That in their summer it would le in the belt of 
the southeast trade winds and would therefore have consider- 
able rainfall.) There is another fact you must know before you 
can tell how much rain these winds would give to the country. 
(The surface features.) Turn to the relief map and see if you 
can tell how the surface affects the rainfall. (The land rises grad- 
ually toward the north, which means that the winds gradually 
rising would distribute considerable rain over the country.) There 
is still another fact in this case that will affect the amount of 
rainfall. Who sees? (Paraguay is not next the sea, the breezes 
must pass over part of Brazil first and would thus have less 
moisture to bring to Paraguay.) 
“What would be the conditions during the winter? (The winds 
would be the prevailing westerlies and there would be little rain.) 
“Tn addition to regulating the rain, these winds would affect the 
temperature. How? [Let class tell as above how each wind 
would affect the temperature. ] 
“Let us then summarize what we have found out about the 
climate of Paraguay.” [Some such paragraph as the following: 
Paraguay has in general a tropical climate, warm even in winter. 
It is an inland country with no direct sea-breezes but deriving 
considerable benefit from those that reach there after crossing 
part of Brazil. Greatest rainfall during their summer, from 
October to May. Less rainfall in winter.] 
Verification.—‘‘ Open your books to pages — to — and also 
to the rainfall, wind and relief maps and see if we are right 
about this. See if we have overlooked anything. [There has 
been some verification, of course, during the lesson by means of 
syllogistie proof and through the O. K. of the teacher placed 
upon certain statements. ] 
“What were we to find out to-day? (If Paraguay has a 
desirable climate.) Do you think it has? Would you like to live 
there as far as the climate is concerned? [Some will, and others 
will not.] 
* * * * * 
“What is the problem on which we are working? (To see if 
Paraguay would be a good place in which to make a home.) How 
much of this problem have we worked out? (We have found 
that the climate of Paraguay would be quite desirable to some

  ATA APPENDIX 
people, while others might not like it.) Yes, and even with those 
who did not like the climate, there might be a reason for going 
to the country. What do you think it might be? (They could 
make a good living easily.) That is something everyone would 
wish to know. Upon what would that depend? (What the 
people did there.) And what would that be determined by? 
(The soil, the products, other natural resources, capital, etc., etc.) 
Sub-aim for Unit 2.—“Let us see if Paraguay has many valu- 
able products. 
Inspection and Inference.—[Recall facts in regard to surface 
and climate.] “What would you expect to find in the heavily 
watered, hilly region to the east? (Forests.) That is right. 
How would they differ from our forests? (Very dense and would 
have different trees.) [If the class knows the general nature of 
tropical forests, let them infer the kinds of trees. Otherwise open 
books and read. Teacher will list the forest products on the 
board: Hard woods, dye-woods, India-rubber, gums, indigo, 
yerba maté, wild oranges. She must explain about the last two.] 
“What else is often found in hilly or mountainous regions? 
(Minerals.) [Little is said in geographies about this and teacher 
will have to tell that although there are few mineral products as 
yet, late reports indicate some mineral wealth. ] 
“What is the nature of the western part of Paraguay? (Val- 
leys, broad meadows, and some swamps.) Would those valleys 
be likely to have rich soil? (Yes, the heavy tropical vegetation 
would have built it up and the many rivers and streams would 
have brought more from the hills.) What then might be the 
nature of the products? (Hay and grain, sugar cane, tobacco, 
rice, mandioca, maize, cotton, etc.) [Teacher lists them on the 
board and the class verifies by looking in the book.] 
“There is another use to which valley and meadowland is often 
put. (Raising cattle and horses.) Yes, that is one of the Bigeesy 
industries of the country. 
Verification.—‘‘Look at this list of products on the oud) 
Open your books to page —, and some of you may use these 
geographical readers, pages — to —. Read to see if we have 
any products listed which are not mentioned in the books. Also 
if we have omitted any. 
“What is our problem again? (To see if Paraguay would be 
@ good place in which to make a home.) What bearing does 
to-day’s lesson have on this? (We were to find out the products 
‘

  LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 475 
of Paraguay in order to see if they would provide an opportunity 
to make a living.) Do you think that these products would pro- 
vide enough industries so that most people could find work suited 
to them? (Probably so.) That will be our aim then, for to- 
morrow. 
Sub-aim for Unit 3—“We shall find out what industries there 
are in Paraguay. 
* * * * * 
[The next unit on industries, others on commerce and trans- 
portation, the people and their customs, the government, ete., 
should be developed in much the same manner. 
In closing, a final summary should be made, summing up the 
points that would make Paraguay a good place in which to make 
a home, and those that would not be so favorable.] 
Discussion.—The foregoing lessons illustrate somewhat 
briefly the salient points of the problem-solving process, 
commonly known as deductive teaching. The method of 
inspection has been mostly developmental, the text being 
used principally to verify. References can be used in 
inspection as well. 
Though this method may be used in many subjects, 
geography presents an unlimited opportunity for interest- 
ing introductions and developments. For instance, this 
lesson (typical of any South American geography lesson) 
could have been introduced through a discussion of current 
events, newspaper clippings, etc. News of the Pan-Ameri- 
ean Union would furnish another good point of departure. 
The fact that brothers and sisters of the pupils may be 
studying Spanish in high school is still another. This 
latter is probably valuable in that it emphasizes trade 
relations and our own close associations with the southern 
continent. 
A particularly good lesson of this type was taught 
under the aim, ‘‘Could Argentina ever become an eco- 
nomic rival of the United States?’’ Other problem-solving 
aims are: ‘‘Why are there such famines in China?’’ 
«‘Why does Russia want India?’’ ‘‘Why the New England 
 
-P-A-G-E-498
  476 APPENDIX 
states are so densely populated,’’ ‘‘Let us find out if 
Oregon could raise flax profitably,’’ ‘‘Why did the settle- 
ment at Jamestown succeed when the others failed?’’ 
. ‘Why does the Oregon Agricultural College produce the | 
best apples in this section?’’ ‘‘Would it pay for Newport 
(or any town) to own its electric-light plant?’’ | 
This will be the only example of problem-solving or 
deductive teaching given. Practically all the incidental 
points have been illustrated in the foregoing lessons. 
While lesson aims should always be problematic, the dif- 
ference between other lessons and those specifically desig- 
nated problem-solving is that in the latter the pupil is 
assumed to know certain rules, principles, or underlying 
causes and reasons. The thinking involved in the lesson 
is the application of these principles to such data as are 
found and the solution of the problem by inference. 
Problematic aims of the inductive type are solved by 
building up a statement (by analysis and synthesis) that — 
directly answers the question in the aim.

Pupils defined “hue” as a mixture between any two neighboring 
standard colors. Teacher hung up standard color chart and gave 
pupils samples of tints and shades, directing them to place them 
properly on chart. Named them as yellow-orange, yellow-green, 
blue-green, etc. 
Pupils were then asked to pick out the colors in the wa.lflower. 
One thought red was included, but on holding flower against chart 
saw the error. Yellow and orange were decided upon, teacher 
warning class that a good deal of experimentation would be neces- 
sary in order to get it exactly right. 
Which color should be put on first when two colors were 
needed? (The light color first or it would not show.) 
The teacher then mounted a flower before class and started 
drawing it herself, explaining the colors, strokes, ete., as she 
worked. Questions were asked of the pupils when possible. 
Imitation—EHach pupil began work on paper previously 
mounted on his drawing board. Four models had been placed 
about the room so that all had a good view. 
Criticism.—Teacher passed about class, asking questions to 
direct attention to errors or possible changes. Direct criticism 
was sometimes made. Occasionally a good piece of work was 
held up for all to see. Errors found with several of the pupils 
were discussed for the whole class. 
Discussion.—This type of teaching is adapted to draw- 
ing, sewing, manual arts generally, spelling, some phases 
of arithmetic, many parts of written composition, ex- 
pressive reading, one type of story-telling, ete. The char- 
acteristic is imitation and repetition of a model, a for-

thought that individuality and initiative are not given. 
play. Any individual variation might be shown, for in- 
stance in the drawing lesson above. Considerable enjoy- 
ment can accompany these lessons in drawing or express- 
ive reading. 
This lesson and the two following are very simple ex- 
amples, but many exercises of this type are very complex 
and call for much planning and ingenuity, as well as care 
that the model is correct and exact.

[The following are just a few random extracts from a complete 
lesson to illustrate roughly and briefly the manner of procedure.] 
Model.—‘‘Sentence in the book, ‘Oh, father! See the hat 
perched upon yonder pole!’ What does this sentence express? 
(Surprise, wonder.) And we must show those things in reading 
it.” 
Imitation.—Pupil reads. 
Criticism.‘ What was the matter, class? (He did not act 
surprised enough, it just sounded like everyday talk.) Try it 
again.” [Different pupils are called upon to demonstrate until — 
the best rendition is selected. ] 
Drill.—Drill was involved in imitation and then again and 
again as the class went over the unit containing this sentence 
trying to perfect the bit of conversation for the play. 
Model.—Sentence in book, ‘‘What will you! Why do you 
stop me here?” This sentence was discussed with class to bring 
out that it expressed anger and should be spoken somewhat 
roughly and with a show of resistance. 
Imitation—Two pupils enacted the bit of action involved. 
[Class commented upon what was good and advised Tell to try 
and push on by the officer and to make his remark as if it meant, 
“Go on, get out of the way, this is none of your business.”’]

‘An Assignment Lesson 
Susszcr Marrer 
Teacher’s Aim 
General.—To teach the history of Oregon. 
Specific—To introduce this study by a discussion of local his- 
tory. 
Analysis of the Aim 
Old Knowledge—tThe class has a general background of history 
from stories and elementary history texts. The fact that they 
know nothing of local history will be brought before them and 
the need for it emphasized. The further fact that much history 
will be lost unless someone soon gathers it from the pioneers and 
writes it down should be mentioned. The class will recall that in 
studying the first settlements in this country, the following points 
usually came in for discussion: 
‘When and by whom settled. 
For what reason. 
Why that particular place was chosen. 
How it received its name. 
Character of settlers. 
Troubles with Indians. 
Early events in the settlement. 
Growth and development. 
New Knowledge.—Omitted here to save space, and because it is 
fully indicated in the assignments made.

“In our history work we have studied things about what coun- 
tries? (Egypt, Greece, Rome, England, United States, etc.) 
‘What things do you know about the history of Oregon? [Let 
them tell any interesting stories they may know.] What do you

  480 : APPENDIX 
know of the history of this country, or of our own city here? 
[Very little is usually known.] 
Pupil’s Aim.—‘‘ We are going to find out how Roseburg was 
settled. 
“Where might we look for information? (Docwments at court- 
house. Letters of people who were here.) Yes, but both sources 
are limited. Where else should we look? (We might ask the old 
people who have been here since the beginning or for nearly that 
long.) Yes, that is the best source of all. Does anyone see 
another reason for getting this information from the pioneers? 
(It will soon be lost if we do not get it and write it down.) 
“What things shall we ask them? [A great number of sug- 
gestions are made.] Let us see if we cannot organize all these 
points into an outline that will make our work easier. Who ~ 
recalls other lessons we have had that will help us in carrying on 
this study? [May have to develop a little but class will recall the 
study of the early colonies and will organize the outline on the 
board that is given under ‘Old Knowledge’ above. ] 
“Now about Roseburg, when was it founded? By whom? 
[Some of class know Mr. Aaron Rose but do not know the date 
of settlement.] Knowing Mr. Rose, we might infer the answer 
to one point in our outline. (That the town was named for him.) 
That is true, but many people think that it was named because of 
the great number of wild roses found growing here. 
“Before white men came, who was living here? (The Umpqua 
Indians.) Yes, the river was named for them. What will we 
want to know about them? (Were they hostile? How many 
were there? Were there any battles near here?) [Assignments 
are made as the lesson progresses; see list below.] 
“Do you think that Roseburg was founded for any of the 
reasons that the early colonies were? (Probably not.) Let us 
find out, then, why people located here. When people choose a 
place. for a home they are usually impressed favorably. Shall 
we gather some first impressions? [Make assignment.] I know 
of one story that I will tell you now. In the spring of 1850, 
Mr. M. E. Moore, who now lives at the corner of Rose and Wash- 
ington Streets, passed through this part of the country. He was 
traveling with three other men on horseback from Oregon City 
to the California gold fields. As they reached the hill, now 
ealled Reservoir Hill, they stopped to look at the valley a short 
distance below. It was thickly dotted with large oak trees and 
grass was growing waist-high beneath them. All four men
-P-A-G-E-503
  
LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 481 
realized the beauty of the spot but Mr. Moore was particularly 
impressed and exclaimed, ‘Boys, I’m coming back here some day 
to make my home.’ At this time there was but one settler, a 
hunter, who had erected a cabin. Three years later Mr. Moore 
returned and this time found Mr. Rose and his family here and 
a settlement springing up. I will not tell you any more about 
this but there are many more interesting things connected with 
it. In 1858 Mr. Moore erected the house in which he now lives. 
Would you not like to hear him tell about it?” 
[The following assignments were developed in like manner.] 
1. When, why, and by whom was Roseburg founded? (See Mrs. 
Rose, daughter-in-law of Aaron Rose.) 
2. Indians of the vicinity and trouble with them. (Judge Fuller- 
ton.) 
3. The character of the early settlers. (Mr. Stanton.) 
4, First impressions or first things noticed. (Mrs. Lane.) 
5. Early happenings in the settlement. (Any of several pioneers.) 
6. The first hotel and why it became so well known. (Mr. Moore.) 
7. Why Roseburg became the county seat, instead of Winchester, 
and how the early government was carried on. (Mr. Buchanan.) 
8. Men prominent in state affairs. (Mrs. Lane.) 
9. The first business structures. The first brick buildings, etc., 
and where they stood. (Mr. Aiken.) 
10. The first homes. (Mrs. Rose.) 
11. The first post office and the early mail service. (Mr. Stanton.) 
12. How seed corn was first brought to this part of the country. 
(Mr. Moore.) 
13. Early methods of communication and transportation. 
14. The coming of the railroad. 
The topies were given to individual pupils or to committees. 
A few alert pupils volunteered to find and bring in other facts 
by consulting other sources than those mentioned. 
Discussion.—This is a very simple illustration of a 
detailed assignment. Obviously the same type of tech- 
nique would be involved if extensive consultation of 
books, museums, ete., in addition to people, was necessary. 
Few difficulties would probably be presented in pursuing 
these assignments, but in some cases the class will have 
to discuss how to approach certain officials or noted per- 
sons. Considerable correspondence may be necessary. 
The kind and amount of notes to be taken should be dis- 
cussed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
  
482 APPENDIX 
It should be noted here that even in simple assignments 
the teacher should discuss the coming lesson, indicating 
the important points, preparing for certain difficulties 
that will be met, ete. 
The further development of such a lesson as illustrated is 
quite obvious. Excellent motivation is afforded for expres- 
sion lessons when the individual reports are made. The ma- 
terial will then have to be organized in class and socialized 
recitations can be used. Illustrations should be gathered 
and a booklet written, different chapters to be done by 
committees from the class. The printing of such a booklet | 
would be a very worth-while outcome for such a series of 
lessons. This undertaking would be called by some 
teachers a project.

“Through the Ages with Father Time,” and were asked to search © 
their copies of the American Magazine and the Atlantic Monthly 
(advertising sections) for the other pictures of the series. In- 
terest was transferred from merely collecting the pictures to 
studying them. A series of problems was then worked out.

DiscussionThe foregoing project is confined to one 
subject and is a good illustration of such organization. 
The following example shows how several subjects can be 
correlated in the consideration of one topic. 
Progect: ‘‘THE Panama CANAL’’ 
This outline was prepared by Miss Muriel Eastburn, 
fifth-grade teacher in Summit, New Jersey, and is used

taken place, the class decided to take a trip south, too. The 
Panama Canal was chosen, the reasons being: 
The warm climate 
The interesting scenery 
Desire to see the workings of the canal 
Desire to know how Panama hats were made.

Prepared by Miss Helen V. Hancy, first-grade teacher 
in Summit, New Jersey, and used through her kind per- 
mission. 
Motivation.—The idea of making a doll house originated in 
the desire to have a home for visiting dolls. 
The house was made from a large packing box, the work 
being done entirely by the children, except for the windows, 
which were put in by the eighth-grade boys. 
They decided on four rooms, dining room, kitchen, and two 
bedrooms. The house was painted and the roof shingled. 
The work of the grade centered in the project as follows: 
Reading 
The children learned to recognize names of the articles of 
furniture. 
They prepared and read ‘‘Doll House’’ stories. 
Directions and suggestions were read from the board. 
A booklet was made containing a story which originated in 
the telling of the experiences in building and furnishing 
the house. 
Spelling 
The need to be able to label work accomplished and to spell 
names served as a great incentive to learn and recog- 
nize letters and words.

Primary Progect: ‘‘ PLAYING STORE’ 
This outline was prepared by Miss Constance Bowen, 
second-grade teacher in Summit, New Jersey, and is used 
here through her kind permission, 
Motivation.—Children brought toys to school which had been 
received at Christmas. Interest centered in an Erector set and 
made all anxious to show their ability to make things. Then 
 
-P-A-G-E-514

arose the question, “What kind of things?” “Toys.” “What 
shall we do with them?” “Play store.” | 
“What kind of a store?” “The Brayton 5 and 10 Cent Store.” 
[From the name of the school.] 
“What signs shall we need?” 
“THE BRAYTON STORE; SPECIAL SALES; BARGAIN 
DAY; Price tags.” One child suggested printing them with the 
school printing press, so he took charge of the signs. 
“What toys or articles shall we make for sale?” 
The children suggested the following list: Kites, aeroplanes, 
trains of cars, sailboats, wheelbarrows, furniture, blocks with 
alphabet, rocking horses, ducks, animals in barn, toy money, 
purses, drums, dolls, doll’s clothes, tin pails, rakes, hoes, spades, 
shovels, balls, rattles, combs, brushes, cups, saucers, hair ribbons, 
beads, telephones. 
“We shall need also to make store windows and a clock for the 
store.” 
Possible future work: 
a. Towards St. Valentine’s Day the children will notice store 
windows and will probably want to make valentines. 
b. Towards Lincoln’s and Washington’s birthdays, flags, soldier 
hats, streamers, hatchets, ete. 
ec. Towards Easter, rabbits, eggs, plants, ete. 
d, May baskets. 
e. Make pictures and get plants and bulbs for “Dutch Life 
Project.” 
f. From making toy money, thrift work. 
g. From storeman’s clock, telling time. 
h. From furniture, home project. 
4. From brush, comb, tooth brush, hygiene project.

‘An example of purposeful activity organized around a 
central unit of interest. The content is of vital material, 
not merely dry book facts, but material taken from real 
life which the pupils can see and feel. It lays the basis 
for larger interests. 
The true factors of study are involved: (1) recognition 
of the problem, (2) collection of data, (3) organization 
of ideas, (4) formulation of judgments, (5) opportunity. 
for initiative and individual reactions.

Teacher’s Aims | 
| 1. To teach the fundamentals of transportation and distribu- 
| tion, centering a series of lessons around one big topic 
of national interest. 
2. Through preparation and presentation, to care for the 
pupil’s interest while leading him to choose new and 
broader interests. 
3. To encourage reflective, original thinking by: 
(a) Stimulating suggestions from children through analysis, 
recall, and good judgment. 
(b) Allowing pupils to criticize suggestions given by class- 
mates, anticipating objections. 
4, To have pupils leave such lessons with an open-minded 
attitude concerning national improvements. 
Pupils’ Aim 
During study of current events constant references were 
found to the St. Lawrence Deep Waterway Project. The brief 
_ articles stimulated questions until finally the children began 
to ask insistently whether such a canal was either necessary 
or feasible. Discussion followed and the following project was 
earried through. 
Prosiem I 
Is a ship canal through the St. Lawrence necessary? 
(Sub-problem) Are existing transportation systems and facilities 
sufficient? 
Through a series of lessons on the railroads and canal systems 
of the country, the pupils discovered that cars cannot be made 
use of to full capacity, that terminals are ordinarily badly 
congested, that selfish interests interfere with intelligent use 
of existing means, etc. In regard to the canals it was found 
that they were not used to full advantage because controlled 
by the railroads. Comparison of past and present river traffic 
showed that rivers and canals are not being used enough to 
justify the expenditures upon them. 
Sample aims during this study were: 
‘‘Why couldn’t the Kansas wheat crop be moved??? 
‘Why does New York prefer the use of the Barge Canal 
to the construction of the Ship Canal?’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 495 
There was much reading of books and magazines, search for 
articles, pictures, and cartoons. These were brought to class 
and discussed instead of being merely displayed. Analysis 
of the articles and cartoons stimulated vigorous class discussion 
and argument as the class divided upon the opinions expressed. 
A book on the history of the Pennsylvania Railroad was 
obtained, and this road was studied in detail as typical of 
the systems serving the Great Lakes district. Pittsburgh was 
studied in detail as a typical terminal city. 
Prosiem IT 
If the Ship Canal is built, will ships be able to go through the 
St. Mary’s River, Detroit River, and the Niagara River? [This 
was raised by the pupils during the course of the preceding 
problem. ] 
A series of lessons of which the following were typical: 
1. Study of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal, with its locks. 
Diagrams were used to show the lake terraces. Children made 
and explained diagrams showing how the locks work. 
2. Latest improvement on the Detroit River and St. Claire 
Flats. Children made a poster of the kinds of boats on the 
lakes that can pass through the present locks; one of those 
which would be admitted if the scheme goes through. 
3. The new Welland Canal being built by Canada, compared 
with the old canals around Niagara. In this was found the 
answer to the problem whether ships could traverse the rivers 
named. The only improvement necessary to allow ships to 
enter and traverse the Lakes freely will be around the rapids 
of the St. Lawrence, 
Prosiem TIT 
Will the advantages of the Ship Canal outweigh thé 
disadvantages? 
During this problem the children learned an important — 
fact about thinking, namely, that some problems cannot 
be solved conclusively even by the best thinkers. Teachers 
are often criticized for setting up aims like the foregoing 
or like the following: ‘‘Did it pay the United States to 
buy, Alaska?’’ and then expecting a definite answer to 
 
-P-A-G-E-518
  496 APPENDIX 
be worked out. The children should rather be led to 
exercise suspended judgment and to see that such prob- 
lems cannot be definitely answered because of the com- 
plexity of the situation. 
The following is the summary of points worked out by the 
class and is typical of other summaries organized by them. It 
also indicates in some measure the work covered. 
Advantages 
Cheaper rates for bulk products, as grain, ore, coal. 
No reshipment at Montreal or Buffalo. 
Lake ports will become ocean ports. 
Freighters can be loaded with bulk products by machinery, already 
in existence at Lake ports. 
Competition will tend to reduce freight rates. 
New industries will develop, such as shipbuilding near tho steel 
centers. rf 
Inland states would reap greater profit from their resources. 
Sale of electricity will help pay for cost and be of service to 
surrounding country, 
Disadvantages 
Shipments would be slow. 
Cost of building and operating ocean freighters is greater than 
that of competing lake freighters. 
Railroad terminals to wharves would need to be rebuilt. New har- 
bors would have to be constructed. 
Ships cannot go into yards of a firm as can railroad with spur 
tracks. Drayage would be a factor. 
Canals have never been used enough to justify the expenditure. 
The St. Lawrence passes through the territory of another country. 
Weather conditions unfavorable. Fogs off the St. Lawrence make 
insurance rates high. Lakes are open only seven months a year. 
Prostem IV 
Afier the canal is completed, what additional data would be avail- 
able to add to our last summary? 
1. Does tt pay for itself? 
2. Does it benefit the country? 
The class gathered the information on the proposal to pay 
for the project by selling electric power developed at the locks 
and dams.
-P-A-G-E-519
  LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 497 
To solve the second point they thought it would be necessary 
to have complete figures upon industries, prices, products, ete., 
as at present and then to figure out as far as possible how 
much increased business could be traced to the canal. They 
decided that an exact answer could not be approximated. They 
did, however, make excellent maps and surveys of the Middle 
West, attempting to prophesy which industries, sections, or 
natural resources would be stimulated. 
The above outlines took many lessons to complete. It 
could be expanded or shortened as circumstances de- 
manded. This particular project was carried through 
in the fifth-grade and was not in any way above their 
heads. It could be adapted to almost any grade in school 
and could well interest high school or college students. 
There were a great number of correlated activities and 
lessons which were carried through as necessary adjuncts 
to the main problem; that is, there was a large amount 
of what Kilpatrick calls ‘‘associate and concomitant 
response.’”

  LESSON PLANS AND LESSON REPORTS 499 
Summary or Purm Activity nv Terms oF TRADITIONAL 
SuBsEcts 
Oral English.—Reports, conversation lessons. Explanation 
of cartoons, analysis of articles brought to class. Specific 
examples: Discussion of methods of loading freight directly 
into cars at Watkins plant at Winona. Description of ore 
loading at Duluth by student who had visited there. 
Written EnglishBusiness letters to railroads and steam- 
ship companies. Outline summaries of facts learned. Brief 
compositions, as, for example, a comparison of lake and ocean 
steamers as related to the problem. 
Spelling and Vocabulary Work.—A great many new words 
were learned and spelled. For example: wharves, draft, 
draught, terminal, Bessemer, competition, freighter, barge, ton- 
nage, bulk freight, package freight, etc., ete. 
Current Events.—Search of many magazines and papers for 
pictures, cartoons, and articles. Use of government reports 
and bulletins. 
Civics and Government.—The speeches of the governors and 
prominent officials stimulated study of the positions held by 
these men. The clash of selfish opinion was noted independently 
by the children, and the class divided much as did the people 
being studied. The reciprocity agreement with Canada was 
studied, together with the relation of Secretary Hughes and 
Congress to such international relationships. The Conference 
on Limitation of Armaments, dramatized shortly before by 
this class, was recalled in connection with mention of Secretary 
Hughes, and discussion ensued as to the possibilities in time 
of war since the canal crosses the territory of two countries. 
[The amount of information concerning international affairs, 
commerce, political and governmental relations that the class 
found and discussed intelligently was remarkable. It should 
not be thought that the pupils’ reactions were always highly 
intelligent or accurate. They made many mistakes, much as 
their elders would, because of limited information, prejudice, 
feeling, etc.] 
Map Work.—Hektographed maps were available, and several 
interesting sets were made by class committees. One set in- 
dicated areas of production for wheat, corn, cattle, coal, lumber, 
ete.; another showed the through rail lines, another the great 
 
-P-A-G-E-522
~ 500 APPENDIX 
terminal cities, another the lake cities likely to become ocean 
ports, etc. They were very valuable in getting an adequate 
idea of the territory, products, and industries affected. 
[One of the criticisms of projects is that they do not always 
afford opportunity for drill on essential facts. Such map work 
gives excellent drill, which was effective, as later tests showed.] 
Maps were also made of the Welland Canal and of the pro- 
posed new route. 
Construction Work.—Closely allied to the map work was the 
construction of charts, diagrams, and models. A large model 
of a set of locks was made and filled with water upon which 
floated a barge and boat. Diagrams and charts explained the 
workings. The lake terraces were shown in profile. 
Many posters were made showing the kinds of ships to be 
used, the products and scenery of the regions involved, the 
terminals and freight-loading machinery, ete. Art posters were 
also made. 
Arithmetic.—Much new work was introduced and drill pro- 
vided for in solving the many mathematical problems presented 
by the discussions of water power, lock levels, tonnage, freight 
rates, expenses of railroad operation, of ships, of canals. 
Geography.—Summarized separately above. 
History.—Study of the reciprocity treaties. Work of Secre- 
tary Hughes and of Congress. The Panama Canal.

12. How have the advantages of a lake port worked to the 
benefit of Detroit? 
13. How will the stimulus of one industry affect another 
in another part of the country? (For instance, the movement 
of ore in greater volume and with greater ease should affect 
the steel industry in other parts of the world.) 
And many others of a like nature. 
REFERENCE MATERIAL 
It would be useless to attempt to list the articles, books, maga- 
zines, pamphlets, ete., that were used. A number of daily news- 
papers were subscribed for, and such magazines as the Scientific 
American, the Journal of Geography, the Literary Digest, the 
Mentor, the Review of Reviews, the Outlook, were used, together 
with many others. In addition, many geography texts and 
readers, government bulletins and pamphlets, travelogues, etc., 
were consulted. 
This project was carried through by Mrs. Lawrence 
Siewert with the fifth-grade class in the Training School 
of the Winona State Teachers College. She was aided in 
organization and procedure by her supervisor, Miss 
Lillian Miller. 
Conclusion.—As stated at the beginning of this appen- 
dix, the plans are not to be regarded as perfect or as 
models, but rather as suggestive illustrations. 
Not every type of work has been illustrated because in 
some cases there is much good material already in print 
and readily available. For instance, no drill plans are 
   
-P-A-G-E-524
  502 APPENDIX 
included, since many book companies publish rather com- 
plete booklets of drill devices and games. A drill plan is 
merely a collection of these, and little is gained from 
reading them over. The teacher must develop skill in 
introducing and sustaining such devices and games. The 
type lesson is also omitted, since there are several books 
of type lessons available. Only a few projects are given 
because of the tremendous number of them that may be 
easily obtained. On the other hand, the type of organiza- 
tion and procedure chiefly illustrated is not often found 
in the published plan book. 
The different plans should be studied in connection with 
the corresponding chapters in Part II of the book. Super- 
visors and teachers in training should be given training 
in writing and analyzing such plans. Teachers in service 
will soon learn to organize material and handle it by 
means of a few notes. The salient points in the subject 
matter and the pivotal questions in procedure are usually 
sufficient.

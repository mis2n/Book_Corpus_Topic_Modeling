  PREFACE, 
The great importance of the practical element in educa- 
tion has gained almost universal recognition during the 
past few years, and to-day educators are practically unan- 
imous in emphasizing its necessity. Both from utilitarian 
motives and in recognition of the value of applied knowl- 
edge as a disciplinary study, they are urging the intro- 
duction of studies which pertain to the life and environ- 
ment of the child. The mental exercise or discipline 
derived from such studies is much greater than is usually 
accredited to them, as the material of study is ever present, 
constantly stimulating the mind to activity. 
The latest demand is for the introduction of the Prin- 
ciples of Agriculture in the rural schools. There are 
special reasons for the introduction of this study. The 
education of the country boy and girl has been “ away 
from the farm and toward the factory” and the city. 
The study of civics, of geography, of history and of bi- 
ography has created ideals of greatness that find their 
expression only in city life. Even the so-called “ Nature 
Study” has been largely sentimental and urban in its 
leanings. The result has been a continual and constantly 
increasing exodus of the most thoughtful and enterpris- 
ing young men and young women of our rural districts 
to the city. The introduction of the study of the Prin- 
ciples of Agriculture in the rural schools proposes to 
make the farm the center of interest and to make all its

industries, its economies, and its science the subjects of 
thought and study. Many of our best sociologists look 
to the introduction of the study of agriculture under 
favorable circumstances as the most helpful agency in 
securing intelligent management of our farms. 
Many books have been prepared whose object is to 
furnish a text-book in elementary agriculture for the use 
of pupils in the rural schools. That these books have 
lacked adaptability for the purpose intended is evident 
from the insistent demands for a text-book, which, while 
it shall not be too difficult for the boys and girls in the 
tural school of to-day, shall yet cover pretty thoroughly 
the numerous departments of our complex agriculture. 
The constant ideal in the minds of the authors was 
the production of a book on this subject that shall be 
simple enough to be placed as a text in the hands of the 
pupils in the upper form of the rural school. Many 
things have been omitted that to others may seem es- 
sential in a book of this kind. The limitations in the 
size of the volume, as well as of the time of the pupil, 
led to the omission of many subjects that would be very 
interesting and profitable, but concerning which special 
treatises should be consulted. 
The French Minister of Education, in giving instruc- 
tions “to assist the masters of rural elementary schools 
in teaching the first rudiments of agriculture,” says: 
“Tnstruction in the elementary principles of agriculture, 
such as can be properly included in the programme of 
primary schools, ought to be addressed less to the mem- 
ory than to the intelligence of the children. It should 
be based on observation of the every-day facts of rural
-P-A-G-E-5
  PREFACE 5 
life, and on a system of simple experiments appropriate 
to the resources of the school, and calculated to bring out 
clearly the fundamental scientific principles underlying 
the most important agricultural operations. Above all, 
the pupils of the primary school should be taught the 
reasons for these operations, and the explanations of the 
phenomena which accompany them.” 
The first part of the book is based upon experiments 
‘ which may be performed in the school room or at home. 
A summary, entitled “ What We Have Learned,” has 
been placed at the close of each chapter. These sum- 
maries furnish definite statements for the pupil to learn, 
and may be used by the teacher as a basis for drill work. 
This plan has not been pursued in the latter part of 
the book, because the subjects considered do not lend 
themselves easily to the experimental method of treat- 
ment. Numerous illustrations have been given, how- 
ever, and it is hoped that the teacher will combine ob- 
servation exercises on the farm with the work in the 
school. 
The preparation of this book was begun by E. S. 
Goff, late Professor of Horticulture in the University of 
Wisconsin. Professor Goff had many years of experi- 
ence in teaching the principles of agriculture to young 
men, and, as a careful investigator and student of agri- 
cultural subjects, he achieved a national reputation. It 
is greatly to be regretted that his death in the summer 
of 1902 prevented him from completing a work that had 
so much of promise in it. Although I was in frequent 
consultation with him during the preparation of the man- 
uscript, and although I have striven to complete the work
-P-A-G-E-6
  6 PREFACE 
in accord with his plans and outlines, I alone am respon- 
sible for its shortcomings and whatever virtues may 
inhere in it are attributable entirely to him. 
It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the work per- 
formed by Miss Devlin, of the Whitewater Normal 
School, in testing the experiments in her classes and in 
giving valuable suggestions in the preparation of the 
manuscript. 
Tam under great obligations to several members of the 
Faculties of the Agricultural Schools connected with the 
University of Wisconsin and the University of Minne- 
sota for valuable criticism and suggestions.

INTRODUCTION. 
A few years ago, I was present at the meeting of the 
State Board of Agriculture in New Haven, where a col- 
lege professor gave an address on Botany. The address 
was scholarly, scientific, and thoroughly interesting, but 
it gave no particular aid or help to a better understanding 
of the problems of vegetable life that confront the farmer. 
‘When the speaker was through, I asked him why it was 
that all the botanical wisdom of the world had not con- 
structed a simple, clear, easily understood text-book for 
schools and farmers on Farm Botany. I stated the great 
need of such a book, and gave the following illustration: 
There are two important laws that govern the growth 
of the red clover plant, which, if understood by the prac- 
tical farmer, would prove of incalculable value to him. 
The first is that the plant, being a biennial, proceeds to 
die when once it has produced seed. The bearing of that 
law on the farmer is this: He allows his clover to advance 
so far in growth before he cuts it that the seed is formed. 
Cut it before seed forming, and Nature, thwarted in her 
purpose, will.rally all her forces and throw a vigorous 
second crop; cut this before the seed forms, and she 
renews her efforts with the same persistency for a third 
crop. In this way, the farmer, if he knows the law, can 
take advantage of it to his greater profit. Allow the 
seed to form, and the plant is then through with its 
maternal purpose, which is the object of its life, and but 
9 
   
-P-A-G-E-18
  Io INTRODUCTION 
a very light second crop can be grown. This law applies 
to alfalfa as well. Delay the cutting of the first crop 
too long and the second crop will be very light. 
Take the second law: For years the farmers of the 
United States have suffered untold loss through the dying 
of their newly seeded clover. When sown with a grain 
nurse crop, the clover would germinate and make a fine 
stand if sown with oats, for instance, but, when the oats 
were harvested, the young clover plants would be burned 
to death. I noticed, however, that, where a farmer had 
a field of oats, that was seeded with clover, near his 
barn, if he cut into it, when the oats were green, to feed 
his horses or to soil his cows, the young clover plants in 
that part of the field always lived and survived the sum- 
mer heat. I observed, also, that, where a farmer cut a 
swath around the outer edge of his oat field about two 
weeks before the oats were ripe that he might have a clear 
space on which to turn his reaper and team, there, also, 
the clover survived. I reasoned from these observations 
that there was something in the growth of the oats and 
clover together that acted disastrously to the young 
clover plants. It took me a long time to find the botan- 
ical fact, so stated that an ordinary man could under- 
stand it that oats require five hundred pounds of water to 
ripen one pound of the grain. I then saw that, with this 
tremendous drainage of moisture from the soil in conse- 
quence of the ripening of the grain, together with the 
evaporation by sun and wind, the young clover plants 
could not live; but that, when the oats were cut before 
the grain formed, the clover could live. 
T asked the professor: “Is there anything to hinder
-P-A-G-E-19
  
INTRODUCTION It 
these two important biological facts bearing on the clover 
plant being put in a text-book and taught to the farmer’s 
boy ?” 
The professor did not answer these questions very 
satisfactorily. 
I have been pushing along this road for years, striving 
to have the elements of agriculture taught in the common 
schools of my own state, Wisconsin. I have seen some- 
thing done. No teacher is now allowed to graduate from 
our Normal Schools until he or she has taken a course in 
Elementary Agriculture. Furthermore, we have estab- 
lished several County Training Schools, whose particular 
function is to educate the teachers of the country schools 
for the teaching of Elementary Agriculture. We have 
also begun the erection of County Agricultural Schools 
which take the country farm boy and give him instruction 
something like that now given in the Short Course of our 
Agricultural College. France, Germany, and, indeed, 
nearly all Europe, are doing this work of teaching Ele- 
mentary Agriculture in the primary schools. These na- 
tions are fifty years ahead of the United States in their 
comprehension of how it is to be done and in the doing 
of it. 
As a people, we have gone mad in our pursuit of so- 
called “ higher education.” Rightly understood, there is 
no such education. A better term would be “ wider edu- 
cation.” Our teachers, even in the country district 
schools, unwittingly educate the farm boy and girl away 
from the farm. If they seek to inspire in them ambition 
in the pursuit of knowledge, it is for the purpose, as they 
say, of encouraging them to “rise in the world.” What  
-P-A-G-E-20
  i2 INTRODUCTION 
American agriculture needs more than anything else is 
that it become intellectualized, that it be made the pur- 
pose and object of mental, as well as physical, effort. 
Its greatest reward as to wealth, honor and contentment 
lies in that direction. It must be made the object of 
brain work as well as manual work. To bring about 
this attitude, we must take hold of the children of our 
farmers in their home schools, and there show them that 
the problems of the farm are great enough to enlist all 
the brain power they can summon. Once there is estab- 
lished in the mind of the farm boy an intellectual in- 
sight into the problems of the farm, the future of better 
farmers, better farms, and a wider, stronger conserva- 
tion of the resources of the state, will be established. 
It seems to me self-evident that, if we are to reach this 
great body of men, in whose hands lie the destinies of 
all future agriculture and, to a great extent, the weal 
of the whole country, it must be through the schools 
in which and in which alone they receive their education.

FIRST PRINCIPLES OF AGRICULTURE 
1. DEAD AND LIVING MATTER. 
Illustrative material: A few grains of sand on a piece of 
paper. Examine the grains carefully. 
Dead Matter.— Figure 1 shows a grain of sand as it 
appears under the microscope. Its corners have been 
rounded by rubbing against other 
ESN grains of sand. It can not move; 
a iN oN it can not change its form. We 
ids) might leave it under the microscope 
tie’ ae) and look at it daily for a year, and it 
Fro. 1-—Grainofsana, WOuld look just the same every time. 
med, It never grows larger and never di- 
vides into other grains of sand unless it is broken by 
some outside force. It has no life; it is dead. 
Living Matter.—Figure 
shows some yeast plants as : Se pig Sey 
they appear under the micro- 
scope. The yeast plant is so Oe, 
small that it can be seen only M2 
with a microscope. Each yeast 
plant consists of a closed sack 
or cell, containing a jellylike 
liquid called protoplasm. If 
we watch the yeast plant under the microscope, we find 
that it changes in form. Sometimes little swellings grow

out, like knobs on a potato, and these will by and by 
separate themselves from the parent and become other 
yeast plants. The yeast plant is alive; so is every grow- 
ing plant. 
The Ameba.— Figure 3 shows several specimens of 
the ameba, an animal found in stagnant water. It is so 
small that it can be seen only 
with a microscope. The ameba 
ae & consists of protoplasm; it can 
move itself about; it can 
Fic. 3—Amebas, magnified. change its form; it can divide 
and so make other amebas. The ameba, like the yeast 
plant, is alive. Plants and animals have life. Sand 
and all other mineral matters are dead. Plants and ani- 
mals may lose their life, and then their bodies, like 
mineral matter, are dead. 
Plants and Animals Grow.— If we put a drop of fresh 
yeast into a bottle containing well water with some sugar 
and a little white of egg stirred into it, and set the bottle 
in a warm place, in a few hours the liquid will become 
whitish in color. This is because millions of new yeast 
plants have formed from the few we put in. The young 
yeast plants and amebas are at first small, but they grow 
until they are as large as their parents. Plants and 
animals increase in number, and grow in size. Dead 
things can not, of themselves, grow or increase in 
number. 
Cells.— Figure 4 shows a small part of an apple leaf, 
as it appears under the microscope. Notice that it is 
made up of many small sacks grown together. Each of 
these little sacks is a cell, something like a yeast plant.
-P-A-G-E-23
  DEAD AND LIVING MATTER 15 
A plant large enough to be handied is made up of a mul- 
titude of cells grown together, each of which is, or has 
been, alive. An animal large 
microscope is also made up 
of many living cells, each of 
which is like the ameba in 
many respects. 
Needs of Plants and Ani- 
mals.— Plants and animals 
need certain things to keep 
them in health. Protoplasm, 
which is the living part of 
cells, must have both food 
and water, or it can not live Fic. 4.—Showing cells for the ap- ; ple leaf in a section from its upper long. In all the higher to its lower surface. Highly magnified. The spaces marked plants and animals, it must 1 # cavities between the cells. 
have air, or it will smother; it must receive a certain 
amount of warmth, or it will either freeze to death or 
cease to grow; and the protoplasm in certain cells of the 
higher plants must have light, or the plants will soon die. 
To keep plants and animals healthy, we must provide 
them, as far as possible, with any of these things that 
they lack. 
Produce.— The farmer rears plants and animals. He 
rears plants on his land, and his animals feed on the 
plants. Plants and animals reared on the farm are 
called produce. The farmer sells a part of his produce 
to those that need it, and thus secures the means to buy 
clothing and tools, to erect his buildings, to improve 
his home, and to educate his children. His soil is formed 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
16 = DEAD AND LIVING MATTER 
of mineral matters and the dead remains of plants and 
animals. The farmer needs to learn all he can about 
the soil, and how plants and animals grow. He should 
also strive to learn what crops are likely to repay his 
labor best, and how to dispose of these to the best ad- 
vantage of himself and his farm. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Plants and animals are living beings. They are made 
up of cells. 
The simplest plants and animals are made up of single 
cells. 
All living cells contain protoplasm. 
The soil is largely dead mineral matter. 
The farmer should learn all he can about the plants 
and animals he rears, about his soil, and about his crops 
and markets.
-P-A-G-E-25
2. THE SOIL AND SOIL WATER. 
Illustrative material: An oil lamp, a narrow-neck bottle, two 
other bottles, and some candle wicking. 
Prepare the soil lamp, Figure 5, by filling a small, narrow- 
neck bottle about one-third full of kerosene oil, and then filling 
the bottle to the top with small fragments of dry earth. If the 
oil does not saturate the earth to the top, add a little more oil. 
Prepare the experiment shown in Figure 6, using a small lamp 
wick or candle wicking. Add water to the left hand bottle, and 
wet the wick before putting it in place. 
Oil and the Lamp Wick.— In a lighted oil lamp, the 
oil passes upward through the wick as fast as it burns. 
The oil passes through the wick because the wick contains 
a number of small spaces or pores 
that connect with one another. It 
would rise through almost any very porous 
substance as a sponge, a piece of blotting 
paper, a piece of brick, or of porous 
earth. 
Dry Earth as a Wick.—Figure 5 shows 
a lamp made of a bottle filled with dry 
earth, which answers for the wick. The 
oil rises through the earth because 
the earth is porous. It creeps from 
: one particle of the earth to another at the 
Fre. —Farth points where the particles touch one an- 
Aone other. The larger the particles are, after 
they pass a certain size, the slower will the oil rise, because 
the points where the particles touch are fewer. 
17 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 THE SOIL AND SOIL WATER 
Capillary Attraction Water also will rise through a 
lamp wick or other porous substance. In the experi- 
ment shown in Fig- 
ure 6, the water 
passes through the 
wick from the left 
bottle into the right 
one. If the bottle 
contained porous 
soil, as in Figure 5, 
the water would rise 
through the soil to 
the top of the bottle, 
where it would slow- 
Fic. 6.—Illustrating capillarity. ly pass off into the 
air. The force which causes oil, water or any other 
liquid to rise through a porous substance, is called 
capillary attraction or capillarity. 
Evaporation.— If we rub the blackboard with a damp 
cloth, the board does not remain wet long, because the 
water passes off into the air. We hang wet clothes upon 
a line so the water in them will pass off into the air and 
they will become dry. The passing off of water from a 
wet surface into the air, we call evaporation. 
Evaporation Rapid Water is evaporating from the 
soil out of doors nearly all the time when it is not raining; 
and, as in the lamp wick the oil rises from the font as it 
burns at the top of the wick, so the water rises from the 
deeper soil as it evaporates at the surface. In countries 
that have frequent rains, the water rises from below 
in dry weather nearly or quite as fast as it evapo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE SOIL AND SOIL WATER Ig 
rates, hence the soil is kept moist except at the very 
surface. 
Water Not at Rest.— During rain, or whenever the 
surface soil is wetter than the soil below, the water passes 
down into the soil until it reaches.a layer that it can not

pass, or until the upward current again begins; the water 
in the soil is seldom at rest. In many places, there is a 
surplus of water deep down in the soil, which flows into 
wells or flows out in certain places as springs. 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    20 THE SOIL AND SOIL WATER 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
The rising of oil through the wick of a lighted lamp 
is due to a force called capillary attraction. The same 
force causes water to rise through the soil to the surface 
in dry weather. 
The passing off of water from a wet surface into the 
air is called evaporation. 
In dry weather, water evaporates from the surface of 
the soil, and other water from below rises to take its 
place. In wet weather, the water in the soil tends to 
move downward.
-P-A-G-E-29
  3. PLANTS AND WATER. 
Illustrative material: A dried leafy shoot from some growing 
plant and three bean seedlings that have attained their rough 
leaves; two small bottles, one filled with water; a fruit jar. 
Evaporation from Plants.— If we cut off a leafy branch 
from a growing plant and put it in a warm oven, the 
leaves and stem will soon become much smaller and 
lighter and more brittle. This is because the water which 
the branch contained has been evaporated by the heat. 
Often more than four fifths of the weight of a growing 
plant is water. Hay is dried grass. The farmer cuts 
his grass and lets it lie 
exposed to the heat of 
the sun until most of 
the water it contained 
has evaporated. 
Water Necessary.— 
If we cut off two bean 
seedlings at the surface 
of the ground and put 
the stem of one into 
a bottle of water and 
that of the other into an Ne 
empty bottle, we shall Fic. 8.— Plants need water. 
find that the leaves of the seedling that we put in the 
empty bottle will soon droop, while those of the other 
will remain fresh. (Figure 8.) This experiment 
teaches some important things about plants. First, it 
2t     
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 PLANTS AND WATER 
shows that the leaves of plants growing in a rather dry 
atmosphere must have a constant supply of water, or they 
can not remain fresh. Second, it shows that the water is 
taken in through the stem. Third, it shows that, in uncut 
plants, the water must come into the stem from the root, 
because our stems were cut at the surface of the ground. 
Evaporation through Leaves.— If we fill two bottles 
of the same size with water, and insert in the neck of one 
of them several small twigs from a growing plant, we 
shall find that the surface of the water will lower much 
faster in the bottle containing the twigs than in the other 
bottle. Where has this water gone? If now we place 
a cool fruit jar over the twigs and hold it there a short 
time, we shall be able to answer this question. Water 
from the leaves will gather on the inside of the glass, so 
that we can easily see it. If we leave the jar over the 
twigs for half an hour, drops of water will flow down its 
. inside surface. This shows that 
some of the water taken up by the 
roots or plants passes off, or trans- 
pires, through the leaves. 
Leaves do not Take in Water.— 
If we take the fresh bean plant out of 
the water and put one of its leaves 
instead of the stem into the water, 
we shall find that the other leaves 
soon droop. (Figure 9.) This 
shows that the leaves of the bean 
plant can not take in much water, 
  Fic. 9.— Leaves do not absorb water. even when they are surrounded by 
it. The leaves of plants can not take in much water, 
either from water or from moist air,
-P-A-G-E-31
PLANTS AND WATER 23 
Plants Dry the Soil.—Since plants require much water, 
and since their roots take this water from the soil, soil on 
which plants are growing dries much faster than the 
same kind of soil with no plants growing on it. The soil 
seldom contains water enough in dry weather to supply 
crops with all they need. Weeds waste valuable water 
in dry weather; so do the hedges of underbrush some- 
times allowed to grow along fences. The farmer and the 
gardener should constantly study how to prevent the 
waste of soil water in dry weather. We shall learn how 
to do this in a later lesson. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Growing plants consist largely of water. 
This water is taken in by the roots and passes off 
through the leaves as vapor. 
The leaves of plants can not take in much water. 
The soil seldom contains enough water in dry weather 
to supply fully the needs of crops. 
Weeds and useless underbrush waste valuable soil 
water in dry weather.

  4. HOW PLANTS FEED. 
Illustrative material: Dissolve a bit of camphor gum in a

  Fic. 10.— Diagram showing spaces be- 
tween particles, Solutions—If we 
put a teaspoonful of 
sugar into a glass 
of water and then 
stir the water with 
the spoon, the sugar 
will soon pass out of 
sight. We say it has 
dissolved in the wa- 
ter. We explain its 
disappearance by 
supposing that it 
has separated into 
particles that are too 
small to be seen, and 
that these particles 
have entered among 
the particles of the 
water, something as a quart of peas might be poured 
into the spaces between apples in a peck measure. (Fig-

ure 10.) If now we evaporate the water from the glass, 
the sugar will again appear in the bottom. 
Mineral Matter in Plants.—A tea-kettle in which well 
water is often boiled usually becomes coated inside with 
a whitish deposit. Well water contains small quantities 
of certain mineral matters dissolved in it. When the water 
evaporates from the tea-kettle by boiling, these mineral 
matters remain in the bottom, just as in our experiment 
the.sugar remained in the basin after the water evaporated. 
We learned in Lesson 3 that plants take up water, and 
that this water passes off as vapor from the leaves. The 
water thus taken up by plants comes out of the soil and 
so has certain mineral matters dissolved in it. When 
this water is transpired from the leaves, the mineral 
matters remain, just as they remain in the tea-kettle when 
the water evaporates from it. Some of these mineral 
matters are required by the plant for food. Aside from 
water, the roots can take only dissolved substances. 
Other Matter in Plants.—We have now learned how 
plants secure the mineral part of their food. But are 
plants formed entirely of mineral matter? We can 
answer this question by a simple experiment. Mineral 
matter will not burn. If we burn a little bunch of hay or 
straw, the part that will not burn, the ashes, is mineral 
matter. The ashes of the hay were brought up from the 
soil in the water that was taken up by the grass roots. 
When we burn a substance, we separate it to some extent 
into the parts that once came together to make the sub- 
stance. Nearly all of the part of the hay that passes 
off into the air in burning came out of the air while 
the grass was growing.  
-P-A-G-E-34
    20 HOW PLANTS FEED 
Carbon from the Air.— It seems strange that a part 
of the grass could come out of the air. We can see the 
mineral matter left in the bottom of: the tea-kettle, and 
so can easily believe that the soil water contains mineral 
matter. But we can not see the air, and it is hard to 
understand how matter can come out of the air to make 
a plant that we can see, handle and weigh. But, just 
as the soil water has sotid mineral matter dissolved in it, 
so the air has a gas called carbonic acid mixed with it. 
This gas is formed of two substances: carbon, which is a 
solid that we can see and handle; and oxygen, a gas that 
we can not see. When the oxygen is taken out of the 
carbonic acid, the solid carbon is left, just as when the 
water is taken out of the sugar solution the solid sugar 
is left. ' 
Chlorophyll with the Sun making Starch.—The car- 
bonic acid enters the leaves of plants through very small 
openings. It then enters the cells and comes in contact 
with a substance called chlorophyll, which the cells of 
. leaves contain. Here a wonderful change takes place. 
When the sun is shining, the carbonic acid and a part of 
the water that the cells contain are decomposed,— that 
is, they are separated into the parts that form them. 
Some of these parts, including the carbon, then unite 
again and form a new substance that is very different 
from either the carbonic acid or the water. This new 
substance is starch, or something of very similar compo- 
sition. (Figure 11.) It may be formed in any part of 
the plant that is green,— that is, in which the cells contain 
chlorophyll. But it is formed chiefly in the leaves,
-P-A-G-E-35
HOW PLANTS FEED 27 
Food of Plant Made in Leaves.—This starch or like 
substance formed in the leaves, together with some of the 
mineral matters brought up in the soil water, serves as 
food for the protoplasm of the cells, so that the cells 
     
  
containing dissolved mineral

increase in number rapidly and thus cause the plant to 
grow. The cells in all parts of the plant, including the 
farthest root tips, are fed by this leaf-formed food. It
-P-A-G-E-36
28 HOW PLANTS FEED 
follows that the health of the plant depends upon the 
health of its leaves, 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Certain substances may be dissolved in water. By 
evaporating the water the dissolved substances may be 
recovered. 
Soil water has certain mineral matters dissolved in it. 
These enter the roots of plants with the soil water. When 
the water passes off by transpiration, these mineral mat- 
ters remain in the leaves. 
When we burn plant or animal substance, the ashes 
show merely the part that came from the soil. The rest 
came from the air. 
Carbonic acid and water are decomposed in the green 
leaves of plants by the action of sunlight. Some of the 
parts unite again to form starch, or a similar substance, 
which nourishes the cells and causes the plant to grow. 
Without healthy leaves a plant can not do well.

5. HOW PLANTS GROW. 
Illustrative material: Specimens from parts of living plants 
illustrating the root, stem, buds, leaves, flowers, and fruit or 
seed. 
Root Downward, Stem Upward.— Figure 12 shows 
a young plant of Indian corn. It grew from the kernel 
to which it is attached. Two tiny shoots 
grew from the kernel. One of these grew 
down into the dark, damp soil to become the 
root; the other grew up into the light to be- 
come the stem. Every seed when it ger- 
minates,— that is, when it begins to grow,— 
sends out two shoots, one of which tends down- 
ward, and the other, upward. During the life 
of the plant, the stem and root that start in 
the seed normally continue to grow by the di- 
vision and growth of certain groups of cells 
near their tips. 
Root Hairs.— Figure 13 shows some very’ Planet of 
young radish plants that were grown in a seed ee 
tester. Notice that each tiny white root that grew from 
the seed is clothed with a downy fringe that looks like 
the finest silk. These delicate fibers are called root 
hairs, and they take up water for the plant. The young 
roots of most plants are clothed with root hairs. These 
draw in water from the soil with a certain amount of 
force. This force, aided by some other forces, causes the 
29   
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 HOW PLANTS GROW 
water to rise through the stem and to supply all the cells 
with water and with food. 
The Stem.—The stem bears the 
leaves, buds, flowers, and fruit or 
es 4 seeds. In upright-growing plants, 
— the stem supports these parts at 
some distance above the earth; 
sometimes, as in the grape-vine, the 
stem climbs upon other objects for 
support; sometimes, as in the mel- 
on, it creeps on the ground; in 
other plants, as the potato and quack 
grass, it may even grow in part un- 
derground. (Figure 14.) As we 
Fro) zg Young sradien.- Have learnediin [eesson: 3, ‘the stem 
plants is the channel through which the 
food prepared in the leaves passes to the roots. 
The Leaves.—The leaves grow out from the stem at 
regular places. If we hold a leaf toward the light, and 
place a finger behind it, we find that the light can pass 
through the leaf. As we learned in Lesson 3, the sun- 
light shinning through the leaf cells prepares the food 
for the cells of the whole plant. The cells of the leaf 
are arranged in thin plates to expose a very large number 
of them to the action of the sunlight. (See Figure 11.) 
The leaves look green because their cells contain green 
chlorophyll. But the cell walls of the leaves are trans- 
parent as glass. 
Leaves Necessary.—We learned in Lesson 4 that the 
health of the plant depends much upon the health of its 
leaves. If insects eat the leaves, or if the leaves are 
picked off or broken, they can not prepare food, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
HOW PLANTS GROW Se 
the cells of the root will not be so well fed; then the root 
can not grow so fast, and so can not absorb so much 
water for the leaves, 
so the whole plant 
must grow more slow- 
ly. If, from any 
cause, the leaves do 
not receive their full 
share of sunlight, they 
can not prepare their 
amount of food, and 
the plant will 
suffer. The 
leaves of our 
plants should 
be protected 
from harm as 
far as possible.

(Figure 15.) Ifa part of the 
stem is growing, the bud at its tip is not well de- 
fined. But on stems that live through winter, 
when growth ceases, the buds are covered with 
scales, which usually render them easily seen. 
Buds inclosed in scales are called dormant buds. 
In woody stems, a dormant bud commonly forms 
in summer just above the base of each leaf. 
Buds. When the leaves drop in autumn, the buds ‘re- 
main. On the return of spring, they expand into new 
leaves or sometimes into flowers. . The bud at the end ~ Fic. 15.—

32 HOW PLANTS GROW 
of the branch is called the terminal bud. This usually 
expands first. It either forms a flower, and dies, or it 
continues the growth of the stem. The Jateral (side) 
buds, if they expand, either open into flowers, and die, or 
they develop into branches. 
Seeds.—In plants that live through winter, the flowers 
are commonly formed in the buds the season before they 
expand. Many flowers are among the most beautiful and 
fragrant of natural objects. They delight us with their 
colors, their perfume, their freshness, their delicacy, and 
their graceful forms. But the flowers have other uses 
than to please the senses. By means of their flowers, 
plants are able to form the fruits and seeds we prize so 
much for food. Without seeds, many kinds of plants 
would soon pass away, for there would be no more little 
plants to take the places of those that die. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
The germinating seed sends out two shoots. One of 
these aims downward to become the root; the other aims 
upward to become the stem. 
The root fixes the plant in the soil and supplies it with 
water and a part of its food. Roots can not live without 
air. 
In the potato and some other plants, a part of the stem 
grows underground. 
The live terminus of the stem is called the bud. In 
plants that live through winter, the buds are covered 
with scales as growth ceases. 
In plants that live through winter, the flowers are com- 
monly formed the season before they expand.

6. THE IDEAL SOIL. 
Illustrative material: Jars or boxes containing black garden 
loam, clay, and sand. Mix a small proportion of sand with the 
clay to make a clay loam. Mix a large proportion of sand with 
the clay to make a sandy loam. Pour water on each kind of 
soil, and have the pupils note how rapidly it soaks through in 
each case and also the effect after it has dried. 
Soil a Reservoir for Water.— We learned from Lesson 
3 that plants transpire much water from their leaves, and 
that this water is taken up by their roots. The roots 
must get from the soil as much water as they need or 
the plants can not thrive. The soil receives its water 
from rains and snows, and these at irregular intervals. 
The ideal soil, therefore, must serve as a reservoir to 
receive and hold enough of the rain and the snow water 
to supply the needs of crops. 
Soil Must Be Porous.—We learned in Lesson 4 that 
living cells require air as well as food. The live roots 
of plants consist of living cells, not one of which can live 
long without air. The ideal soil must, therefore, be 
porous enough to admit all the air the roots require. 
Rootlets will not grow into clumps or clods that are so 
compact that air can not enter them. It seems strange 
that the soil can supply the roots of plants with both water 
and air at the same time. A soil in proper condition for 
the rapid growth of roots may be compared to a wet 
sponge with air circulating through its. pores, while the 
substance of the sponge contains much water. 
33
-P-A-G-E-42
34 THE IDEAL SOIL 
Air and Water in Soil Figure 16 will help us to 
understand how the roots of plants are supplied with both 
water and air. The roots of most farm and garden 
crops grow fastest just at the bottom of the layer of soil 
that is turned by the plow. The soil above this point 
is better supplied with air than that below, while the 
subsoil, which is the part below this point, is better sup- 
plied with water than that above. The place where the 
plowed soil rests on the subsoil is, therefore, best supplied 
with both air and water.

      "Tiledrain 
Fic, 16.—Water in the soil. 
Loam.—Most farm and garden soils consist mainly of 
a mixture of clay and sand. Such a soil is called a Joam. 
Sandy loams contain more sand than clay. Such soils 
dry rapidly. Clay loams consist mainly of clay. These 
retain Water much better. The best soil for growing 
crops contains sand enough to let the surplus water move 
downward, and clay enough to hold sufficient water for 
the use of crops. Too much clay causes the soil to 
“bake,”— that is, to harden on drying. Soils inclined 
to bake may be improved by manuring, by the addition 
of sand or ashes, and sometimes by the use of lime. 
Drainage Necessary.— If the pores of a soil remained 
filled with water a long time after rain, the air would 
be forced out and the roots of the crop growing on the
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE IDEAL SOIL 35 
land might be smothered. The ideal soil must, therefore, 
be well drained, so that its pores will not long remain 
filled with water even in wet weather. This means that 
the subsoil must permit the surplus water to pass through 
it rather easily. 
Tiling—Soils over a subsoil containing too much clay 
dry out slowly in spring, and after heavy rains. Such 
soils may often be improved by draining,— that is, by 
providing ways for the surplus water to flow off. Ditches, 
connecting with an outlet on lower ground, may be dug 
through the land. Brick tubes called tiles are often 
buried in such ditches, and the surplus water flows out 
through these. (See Figure 16.) Sometimes brush or 
stones are used in place of tiles. Lands thus drained are 
often among the best for farming and gardening. 
Plant Food in Soil. We learned from Lesson 4 that, 
with the exception of carbon, the food of plants comes 
from the soil, and that it is dissolved in the soil water. 
If the soil does not contain food enough, the plants can 
not grow well, even though they have everything else 
that they need. The ideal soil must have sufficient plant 
food in a form that can dissolve in water to supply the 
needs of crops grown upon it. In the next three lessons, 
we shall learn about supplying the soil with plant food. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
The soil serves as a reservoir to catch and hold the 
water that falls in rains and snows, and to give it out as 
crops need it. ; 
The soil should be porous enough to admit plenty of 
air to the roots of plants.  
-P-A-G-E-44
36 THE IDEAL SOIL 
The soil is commonly best supplied with water and air 
at the bottom of the layer turned by the plow. 
The subsoil should be well drained, so that the surplus 
water can pass down quickly. 
The soil should contain enough plant food, in a soluble 
condition, for the needs of crops.

7. HOW TO KEEP THE SOIL FERTILE. 
Illustrative material: Two jars or dishes, rain water, well © 
water, two small pieces of gauze, and a few kernels of wheat. 
A small sample each of nitrate of soda (Chile saltpeter), phos- 
phoric acid, and caustic potash. These may be purchased at a 
drug store, and illustrate common forms in which these sub- 
stances are used by plants. 
How to Make the Land Poor.— If we dissolve an ounce 
of sugar in a glass of water, and then dip out a teaspoon- 
ful of the solution, of course we take out a part of the 
sugar. We learned in Lesson 4 that plants take up soil 
water containing dissolved mineral matters. Now, if 
these plants are taken off the land on which they are 
growing, the soil can not contain so much: soluble mineral 
matter as it contained before. If we continue to raise 
crops on the land, and to talee them off and sell them 
without returning any soluble mineral matter to the soil, 
the soil will soon become “ poor,’— that is, there will 
not remain enough of some mineral matters to feed plants 
well. 
Certain Food Required by Plants.—When a painter 
' wishes to prepare some paint to match a particular shade 
of color, he mixes a certain amount of paint of two or 
more colors; if he uses a larger or a smaller quantity 
of one of these colors, or if he adds another color he does 
not get the tint he desires. It is just so when Mother 
Nature builds up a wheat plant; she uses certain amounts 
of a definite number of materials from the soil, and can 
37
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 HOW TO KEEP SOIL FERTILE 
not vary these amounts much, nor can she use one ma- 
terial instead of another. When the carpenters that are 
building a house run out of nails, their work must stop 
until more nails are provided; or, if they try to make 
Fic. 17.— Plants growing in water. 
  their nails hold out by 
using less than the 
usual number, the 
house will not be strong 
and may be blown 
down by the first hard 
wind. Just so, if one 
of the soil materials 
that go to make up a 
plant runs short, the 
plant must stop grow- 
ing,, or the growth 
made will be unhealthy, 
and the plant will fail 
from disease. 
Soil Water Holds 
Plant Food.— Figure 
17 shows some wheat 
plants growing in wa- 
ter in two jars. The 
right-hand jar contains 
rain water, and the left- 
hand jar contains well 
water,— that is, water that has come out of the soil. 
Rain water has almost nothing dissolved in it, because, 
when water evaporates into the air, the dissolved ma- 
terials it contained are left behind. In this experiment, 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  
HOW TO KEEP SOIL FERTILE 39 
the water in both jars was boiled before being put in. 
The rain water was boiled to drive off the gases it had 
taken from the air, and the well water was boiled to evap- 
orate a part of the water and thus to make stronger the 
solution of mineral matters it contained. From the 
picture, we see that the plants in the jar containing 
the well water are growing faster than those in the 
other jar. This is because the well water contains 
in solution the materials that the wheat plant needs for 
food. The rain water, on the other hand, contains al- 
most no food material. The only reason the plants can 
grow in the rain water at all is that the seed contains a 
small amount of food. When this food is used up, the 
plants will soon starve. 
Make-up of Rich Soil Chemists have found that 
certain quantities of about a dozen different materials 
are used by plants for food. The one that is used in 
largest proportion is carbon, and, as we learned in Lesson 
4, this comes fom the air. All the others come from the 
soil. But of all the substances that come from the soil, 
only three often run short; most soils contain a large 
surplus of all the others. The three that often fail are 
called nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. These are 
the only substances, then, that the farmer or gardener 
needs to put on his land often to keep it “ rich,”— that 
is, to give it all it needs to produce good crops; and, since 
of t lese nitrogen is most often lacking, it must be sup- 
plied most generously to the soil. 
Manure.—When plants of any kind grow on the land, 
they take out of the soil what they need for food. If we 
put these plants back on the land and let them decay,  
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 HOW TO KEEP SOIL FERTILE 
they return to the soil the plant food they took from it in 
growing. Almost all plant material, therefore, is good 
to put on the ground to make it rich or fertile. Since 
animals grow by eating plants, or by eating other animals 
that grew by eating plants, most animal matter is also 
good to fertilize the land. Manure, which is decaying 
plant or animal matter from barnyards, stables, slaughter 
houses, etc., is the most common material used to fertilize 
the soil. 
Wood Ashes.—Wood ashes contain the mineral mat- 
ters that the trees from which the wood was obtained 
took from the soil when they grew. Wood ashes, there- 
fore, are valuable for making the soil fertile. If they 
have not been Jeached,— that is, if they have not been 
exposed to water, they contain much potash and some 
_ phosphoric acid, but no nitrogen. If they have been 
leached, the potash has been mostly washed out. 
Commercial Fertilizers In some parts of the world, 
deposits are found that are rich in nitrogen, in phosphoric 
acid, or in potash, and those materials are mined for fer- 
tilizers of the soil. Some manufacturing establishments 
have waste products that are useful as fertilizers. We 
can, therefore, buy fertilizers in the market as we can buy 
coal or lime. But commercial fertilizers, as such fertiliz- 
ers are called, are rarely so cheap or so good for the soil as 
manure is, hence it is best for the farmer and gardener 
to depend, as far as possible, on manure to enrich their 
soil. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Plants are formed of certain substances in nearly defi- 
nite proportions. Other substances can not be substituted,
-P-A-G-E-49
HOW TO KEEP SOIL FERTILE 41 
If one food substance in the soil: fails, growth of the 
plant must cease, or, if the growth continue, it must be 
unhealthful. 
Wheat and other plants can be grown in well water, 
as long as the water contains the necessary food materials. 
About a dozen different substances are used by plants 
for food; but, of these, only three, nitrogen, phosphoric 
acid, and potash, are likely to fail in the soil. 
Almost all plant or animal materials are good to use for 
‘enriching the soil. Unleached ashes contain much potash 
and some phosphoric acid. 
Fertilizers may be purchased in the market, but the 
* barnyard and stable manures are generally cheaper and 
more satisfactory than commercial fertilizers.
-P-A-G-E-50
    8. HUMUS IN THE SOIL. 
Illustrative material: A small quantity each of clay, sand, 
and leaf mold. Swamp muck or dark-colored garden soil may 
be substituted for the leaf mold, if the latter can not con- 
veniently be obtained. 
Humus Defined.— If we dig up the ground at the bot- 
tom of a hollow in the woods where the leaves have gath- 
ered and decayed for centuries, we find the soil there very 
dark-colored and very porous. It is dark-colored be- 
cause it consists almost entirely of Awmus, a substance 
that is always formed where vegetable matter decays in 
the soil. Humus is the vegetable or animal matter in 
which the process of decay is well advanced, but not com- 
plete. 
Black Soil_—The prairie lands of the United States are 
very rich in humus, because the prairie grasses grew and 
decayed on them for centuries before they were used for 
farming. The soil of marshes is usually very dark-col- 
ored, because, like the leaf mold of the woods, it consists 
largely of humus. Whenever a farmer or gardener adds 
vegetable or animal matter to his soil, and permits it to 
decay there, he makes his soil richer in humus. The 
more often a soil is manured with such matter, the darker 
colored it is as a rule. 
Humus Helps Growth of Plants.— Humus in the soil 
helps the growth of plants in several ways: it enables the 
soil to hold more water than it otherwise would; it tends 
42
-P-A-G-E-51
HUMUS IN THE SOIL 43 
to prevent the surface of the soil from baking; it absorbs 
ammonia (which contains nitrogen) from the air, and 
thus aids in fertilizing the soil; it also serves to some 
extent as plant food. 
Cropping Land.— When land is cropped year after year 
without being manured, it loses much of its humus, as 
well as much of its mineral plant food. Such a soil is 
said to be “ run down” and it rarely produces good crops. 
It can be restored to a fertile condition only by the appli- 
cation of the humus and the plant food that it lacks. 
This may cost for a time as much as the crops from the 
land are worth. It is, therefore, very unwise to crop 
* land long without restoring the humus and the plant food 
that are removed in the crops. 
The Best Fertilizer—The best way for the farmer or 
gardener to supply his land with humus is to use plenty 
of stable or barnyard manure. Not only does this ma- 
terial produce humus, but, in its early stages of decay, 
it absorbs some water from the air, and, as this water 
contains ammonia, it adds some nitrogen to the soil from 
the air. It also tends to warm the soil, for it gives out 
heat in decaying and also absorbs some heat from the air. 
Plowing Crops Under.—Another way of adding humus 
to the soil is by plowing under unharvested crops, such 
as clover, rye, turnips, or buckwheat. This is often a 
cheaper way of supplying the soil with humus than put- 
ting on stable manure, but, except in the case of clover 
(Lesson 9), these crops do not add fertility to the soil, 
because they take as much plant food out of the soil as 
they return it. They are, therefore, less valuable than 
stable manure.
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 HUMUS IN THE SOIL 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Vegetable or animal matter in which decay is well ad- 
vanced, but not complete, is called humus. 
The presence of humus enables the soil to hold more 
water than it otherwise would, and tends to prevent the 
soil from baking. 
Humus absorbs a little ammonia from the air, and 
serves to some extent as plant food, because the ammonia 
contains nitrogen. 
“Run down” soil can be restored to fertility only by 
supplying the humus and plant food that it lacks. 
Stable and barnyard manures are the best sources of 
humus in the soil. Plowing under unharvested crops 
also enriches the soil with humus.

9. HOW CLOVER HELPS THE FARMER. 
Illustrative material: Plant not over one fourth of an inch 
deep in moist garden soil in a fruit jar, two or three hundred 
seeds of common red clover. Screw on the cap loosely, and 
place the jar in a warm place. When the plants are well grown, 
fill the jar with water and let it stand until the soil is thoroughly 
soaked; then gently draw the plants out so as to injure the roots 
as little as possible. Pass the plants about the class, and let the 
pupils find the swellings on the roots. 
Clover a Fertilizer Nearly every boy and girl knows 
the clover plant, with its three (rarely four) oval leaflets 
and its pretty red or white blossoms. They know, too, 
that all farm animals are fond of clover, both fresh and 
made into hay. The intelligent farmer knows that the 
clover plant is valuable not only for pasture and hay, but 
also as a fertilizer of the soil. 
Clover Takes Nitrogen from the Air— Figure 18 
shows a young clover plant. By looking closely at the 
picture, we may see little swellings or knobs on the 
larger roots. While these knobs, or tubercles, as they 
are called, are not so pretty as the leaf or the flower, they 
are full of interest to the educated farmer, for they serve 
as minute laboratories for the manufacture of nitric acid 
in the soil, and thus they supply the plant with nitrogen, 
the most important kind of plant-food.

flour, when combined with yeast, will make good bread. 
About four fifths of the air consists of nitrogen, but, just 
as the unground wheat cannot be used for bread, so this 
nitrogen can not be used directly by plants as food because 
it is not in the right form. The nitrogen must first unite 
with certain substances 
in the soil and form what 
are called nitrates before 
the plant can use it for 
food. 
Surplus of Nitrates.— 
The little swellings on 
the clover root serve as 
houses in which live 
swarms of minute beings 
called bacteria _ that 
change the nitrogen of 
the air into nitrates. - 
These not only supply 
the clover plant on which 
they live with the ni- 
trates it needs for food, 
but they furnish more 
than the plant needs, and 
so make the soil more 
Fic. 18—Tubercles on clover roots, fertile. Even if the 
farmer mows down the clover and uses it for hay, or if 
his cattle eat it off, the soil will be richer in nitrates than 
it was before the clover was planted. 
Potash Needed.— The young clover plants begin to 
supply nitrates to the soil when they have been growing 
   
-P-A-G-E-55
HOW CLOVER HELPS THE FARMER 47 
for a few days, and continue to do so as long as they 
continue to grow. Clover does not, however, enrich the 
soil with any kind of plant food except nitrates. If we 
continue to grow clover on the land and to remove the 
crop every year, the land is likely to become poor in pot- 
ash and phosphoric acid, unless we add these to the soil. 
Unleached wood ashes used on clover land would supply 
all the food materials needed by the common farm crops. 
Other Plants Similar to Clover.— Clover is not the 
only plant that yields nitrates from the swellings on its 
roots. A class of plants called legumes, such as peas, 
beans, vetches, lentils, and alfalfa, do the same. Crops 
that add nitrogen to the soil are often called nitrogen 
gatherers. These crops are very useful to the farmer, be- 
cause they supply the soil with the most important kind 
of plant food, and thus, to some extent, they take the 
place of manure, of which farmers are almost always 
in need. 
Alfalfa.— Alfalfa can be grown in nearly all parts of 
the country. It is particularly valuable in regions not 
well supplied with water. The plant lives on from year 
to year and makes bountiful crops of hay as well as 
permanent pastures. Swellings or tubercles are found on 
the roots of this plant as well as on the clover plant, and 
it enriches the soil in the same way. 
To make sure of a good catch of alfalfa it is well to 
sow with the seed some soil that has in it the bacteria that 
change the nitrogen of the air into nitrates. These 
bacteria may be obtained from the soil of any field where 
the crop has been grown successfully. 
Cowpea.— The cowpea is neither a pea nor a bean,
-P-A-G-E-56
48 HOW CLOVER HELPS THE FARMER 
but resembles both plants in some ways. This plant is 
sometimes called the great restorer because it restores the 
fertility of the soil to a greater extent than any other 
plant. It is a legume and is especially valuable in the 
South, where it takes the place of clover. 
Nitrogen Gatherers Make Rich Land.— The farmer 
should frequently grow clover, or some other nitrogen- 
gathering crop, on his land. Land from which a crop is 
harvested at midsummer, and which will not be needed 
until the following spring, may often better be sown to 
clover than left idle. As a rule, the farmers that grow 
and feed the most clover have the most fertile farms. 
The clover plant should be regarded as a symbol of good 
luck to the farmer, whether it has three leaves or four. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
The root of the clover plant and other legumes bear 
little swellings which serve as laboratories for the pro- 
duction of nitrates in the soil. 
The legume crop enriches the soil in nitrogen, even 
when it is cut and removed for hay, or eaten off by cattle, 
Legumes remove some phosphoric acid and potash 
from the soil. (See Lesson to.) 
Unleached wood ashes, applied to land, will furnish 
the materials removed by the legumes, and thus will 
maintain the fertility of the soil. 
The cowpea is the greatest restorer of fertility. Other 
plants of the same kind are peas, beans, vetches, lentils 
and alfalfa. They all bear tubercles on the roots which 
hold large numbers of bacteria. 
As a rule, the farmers that grow and feed o most 
legumes have the most fertile farms.

10. THE ROTATION OF CROPS. 
Illustrative material: Reproduce Figures 19, 20, and 21 on the 
blackboard, using different colored crayons to represent the 
nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. 
Plant Foods Prepared Slowly.—We learned in Lesson 
8 that cropping the farm tends to make the soil “ poor.” 
Another process, however, tends to keep the soil fertile 
in spite of the cropping. We learned in Lesson 4 that 
roots can take in plant food only as it is dissolved in 
water. Most soils contain phosphoric acid and potash 
that are not yet dissolved in water, and so are not in 
condition to be used by plants. These undissolved food 
materials are slowly dissolved by the action of carbonic 
acid in the soil; hence the soluble phosphoric acid and 
potash tend to increase slowly in uncropped soils. Some 
ammonia also is washed down from the atmosphere by 
rains and snows, and this tends to increase the nitrogen 
in the soil. But these influences do not, in themselves, 
furnish enough plant food to produce a good crop every 
year. 
Rotation of Crops.— Some products, as wheat and to- 
bacco, remove much fertility from the soil; others, as 
butter, remove very little. If we raise only those prod- 
ucts that remove much fertility, our soil will, of course, 
grow “poor” faster than if we grew a part of the time 
those that remove only a little. In the latter case, the 
fertility furnished by the soil and atmosphere may be 
49
-P-A-G-E-58
50 THE ROTATION OF CROPS 
more than the amount removed, even if no manure be 
applied. Farmers have found it wise to make what is 
called a “ rotation of crops,”’— that is, to change the crop 
raised on a given field from year to year, rather than to 
raise the same crop year. after year. Without rotation, 
certain fields on the farm would soon become too “ poor ” 
to produce good crops, while others would have more 
plant food than the crop needs. 
Tobacco Raising Makes Land Poor.— In the pictures

acid and potash removed from the soil by 1,000 pounds

each of several different crops, are shown in pounds. 
Each small square indicates one pound. From Figure 
19 we learn that tobacco removes large amounts of nitro- 
gen and potash. More than 8,000 pounds of average 
barnyard manure would be required to furnish the nitro- 
gen removed by 1,000 pounds of Virginia leaf tobacco. 
Tobacco is, therefore, not a profitable crop to raise unless 
it can be sold for a very high price. 
Corn, Wheat, and Oats Require Nitrogen.— From Fig- 
ure 20 we learn that Indian corn, wheat, and oats remove

nitrogen chiefly, but that they require far less of this 
than-does an equal weight of tobacco. We observe also 
that Indian corn reduces the soil fertility less rapidly than 
oats or wheat. One thousand pounds of average barn-

Fig. 21.— Showing the amounts of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash re- moved from the soil when 1,000 pounds each of beef, milk, and butter are sold. 
Dairying Removes Little Fertility— From Figure 21 
we learn that beef removes about as much nitrogen, pound 
for pound, as wheat, and more phosphoric acid. But 
beef is worth two or three times as much per pound as
-P-A-G-E-60
52 THE ROTATION OF CROPS 
wheat, while the amount of beef sold from the land is 
less than that of wheat. It is, therefore, usually more 
profitable for the farmer to produce beef than wheat. 
The plant food removed, the price in the market, and 
the labor required to produce a crop, must all be consid- 
ered in estimating the profits in raising it. It appears 
from the picture that butter removes very little plant food 
of any kind from the soil, while it is worth from ten to 
twenty times as much per pound as wheat. The labor 
required to produce butter is, however, much greater 
than that required to produce wheat. 
Cotton.— The cotton plant removes a large quantity 
of fertilizing matter from the soil, but if the lint alone 
were removed it would take but little from the soil. The 
cotton seed is very rich in nitrogen and phosphoric acid 
and if this is not returned to the soil the land soon be- 
comes poor. 
If the cotton seed is sold the land should be restored by 
growing a crop of cowpeas, alfalfa, or crimson clover. 
Rotation Suggested.— These pictures, in connection 
with Figure 18, suggest a rotation of crops for the 
farmer. After raising for a time crops that remove much 
nitrogen, as wheat, oats, Indian corn, or tobacco, it would 
be wise to sow the land to clover or some other nitrogen 
gathering plant, and some kind of grass, and to feed the 
product to cattle for two or more years. The legumes 
will enrich the soil with nitrogen, while the small 
amounts of phosphoric acid and potash removed by the 
milk, butter, or beef, will enable the soil to become 
stocked with these plant foods by the natural method de- 
scribed in the first paragraph of this lesson.
-P-A-G-E-61
THE ROTATION OF CROPS 53 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
The action of carbonic acid in the soil slowly reduces 
phosphoric acid and potash to a soluble form, so that 
they may be used by plants. 
Some nitrogen, in the form of amrtionia, is washed 
from the atmosphere into the soil by rains and snows. 
Tobacco removes very large quantities of nitrogen and 
potash from the soil, hence it can be profitable to the 
farmer only when it sells for a very high price. 
The grain crops remove chiefly nitrogen from the soil. 
They are, therefore, expensive crops for the farmer to 
grow. 
Beef is usually a more profitable product than wheat, 
not because it removes less plant food, but because it sells 
for much more per pound. ; 
Milk and butter remove very little plant food from the 
soil. 
In estimating the profits of producing a given crop, 
the soil fertility removed, the market price, and the labor 
required in production, should all be considered. 
The cotton plant takes large amounts of plant food 
from the soil, but if the cotton seed and hulls are returned 
to the land there is but little loss. 
Land should be frequently seeded to legumes and 
grass, and the product should be fed to livestock, to pre- 
vent the soil from losing fertility.

11. SAVING SOIL MOISTURE. 
Illustrative material: Two lamp chimneys, a pan, fine soil 
and coarse soil. 
Save Moisture in Soil We learned in Lesson 2 that 
water passes off the surface of the soil by evaporation, 
and that other water comes from below to take its place. 
We also learned in Lesson 3 that plants take large 
amounts of water from the soil, and that few field crops 
receive as much water as they need in summer. With 
the proper knowledge, the farmer and the gardener may 
do much to prevent the useless loss of moisture from the 
soil in dry weather. 
Manure to Make Humus.— We learned in Lesson 8 
that the presence of humus enables the soil to hold more 
water. A soil that contains plenty of humus catches 
more water when it rains than one that contains little 
humus. It holds the water longer in dry weather. One 
of the best ways to retain moisture in the soil is to use 
plenty of barnyard and stable manure, and thus keep the 
soil full of humus. Commercial fertilizers do not, to 
any great extent, help the soil to retain water. 
Coarse and Fine Soil Compared.— In the experiment 
shown in Figure 22, the two lamp chimneys were filled 
to the dotted line with dry soil that had been sifted 
through a flour sieve. Enough of the soil that would 
not pass through the sieve was then added to the left 
chimney to raise the soil to the same height as that in 
54
-P-A-G-E-63
SAVING SOIL MOISTURE 55 
the other. A little water was then added to the pan. 
The water rose through the soil by capillary attraction at 
about the same rate in both chimneys until it reached the 
coarse soil in the left one. It continued to rise to the top 
of the soil in the right-hand chimney, but was held back 
several hours by the coarse soil at the top of the left one. 
This experiment shows that, if the surface of the land 
is covered with an inch or two in depth of rather coarsely 
      wenatalen level 
Fine Soil      
Fic, 22.— Effect of pulverizing soil. 
crumbled soil, the water will rise through this layer much 
more slowly than through the soil below. Since evapora- 
tion occurs almost entirely at the surface of the soil, 
this crumbled layer greatly hinders evaporation. Plants 
on such land will have the water thus. saved for growth. 
This crumbled surface is formed by passing over the
-P-A-G-E-64
    56 SAVING SOIL MOISTURE 
ground with a cultivator. In the garden, it may be 
formed with the hoe or rake. A hard rain storm com- 
pacts the soil more or less, hence the crumbling should be 
repeated after every such storm. 
Mulching.— When the surface of the soil can not be 
easily cultivated, as in closely-planted orchards, evapora- 
tion may be reduced by covering with a layer of straw, 
leaves, shavings, tan bark or manure. This operation is 
called mulching. These materials act like crumbled soil 
to hinder the passage of soil water to the surface. Trees 
usually grow much faster on land that is cultivated or 
mulched than on that covered with a growing crop, be- 
cause their roots are better supplied with water. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Plowing manure into the soil helps it to catch and hold 
rain water. 
A surface layer of crumbled soil, which may be formed 
with the cultivator or rake, reduces evaporation, and so 
saves water for the crop that is growing on the land. 
A mulch of litter may be used instead of a layer of 
crumbled soil, to hinder the rise of water to the surface.

12. THE PARASITES OF PLANTS. 
Illustrative material: Portions of a plant that are being in- 
jured by an insect or a fungous disease. A blighted twig from 
an apple or pear tree, a scabby apple or potato, or a smutted 
head of grain will illustrate the latter. 
The Potato Beetle—— Nearly every American boy and 
girl has seen the potato beetle. (Figure 23.) This is 
an insect that feeds on 
the leaves of the potato 
plant. The _ potato 
beetle is a parasite of 
the potato plant. There 
are also very . small 
plants that sometimes 
grow within and -be- 
tween the cells of the 
potato plant, causing 
the leaves to die, and 
the tubers to rot. Any 
animal or plant, that Fic. 23.— Potato beetles, larva, and eggs. 
lives in or within a larger animal or plant, feeding 
upon its substance, is called a parasite. The plants 
that live upon or within animals or other plants mostly 
belong to the class known as fungi. A single plant of 
this class is called a fungus, and parasites of this class 
are called fungus parasites. Parasites are generally 
harmful to the plants or animals on which they live. 
Poison for the Potato Beetle.— We learned in Lesson 
57 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
    58 THE PARASITES OF PLANTS 
4 that the food for the living cells of plants is mostly 
formed in the leaves, and that whatever destroys the 
leaves cuts off a part of the food supply of the plant. 
Every American farmer knows that he must destroy the 
potato beetle or it will nearly destroy his potato crop. 
Since the potato beetle eats the leaves, by putting poison 
on the leaves we can poison the beetle. For this purpose, 
a deadly poison called Paris green is much used. One 
ounce of Paris green may be stirred into twelve gallons 
of water, and the mixture sprinkled on the plants. Or 
an ounce of Paris green may be well mixed with nine 
pounds of land plaster and the mixture dusted on the 
plants. Most other insects that eat the leaves of plants 
may be destroyed in the same way as the potato beetle. 
Plant Lice.— Those who have the care of house plants 
have seen a small green insect on the under side of the 
leaves. This insect, commonly called 
the green fly or the plant louse (Figure 
24), does not eat the leaves as the po- 
tato beetle does. And yet it injures 
the plants on which it lives. It does 
this by sucking out the sap, thus rob- 
bing the cells of water and food. Since 
it does not eat the leaves, we can not 
poison it by poisoning the leaves, as in 
the case of the potato beetle. To destroy the green fly 
and other sucking insects, use some substance that pre- 
vents their breathing. Strong soap suds, tobacco water, 
or kerosene mixed with water, sprinkled on this class of 
insects, usually destroys them. In greenhouses, tobacco 
smoke is much used for the green fly. 
  Fic. 24.—Plant louse.
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE PARASITES OF PLANTS 59 
Fungus Parasites The fungus parasites are often 
quite as harmful as injurious insects. The blight of the 
pear tree, the smutted heads of 
grain (Figure 25), the rotting « 
plums and cherries on the 
trees and grapes on the vines, 
are examples of plant diseases 
due to injurious fungi. We 
have learned to prevent some 
of the injuries caused by 
fungi. It is usually important 
to apply our preventive before 
the disease appears, otherwise 
it may come too late to be 
helpful. 
Bordeaux Mixture.— To 
prevent harmful fungi, the so- 
called ‘“ Bordeaux mixture” 
is most used. To make this, pio 25 Heads of oats affected 
put five gallons of water into a "smut Reduced one-halt 
wooden vessel holding at least twelve gallons, and in 
this water hang a cloth sack containing one pound of 
copper sulfate (also called bluestone and blue vitriol). 
(Figure 26.) In another wooden vessel, slack one pound 
of fresh quicklime in five gallons of water. When the 
copper sulfate has all dissolved, and the lime has all 
slacked, stir up the lime and water and strain the mixture 
slowly through a coarse cloth into the copper sulfate solu- 
tion. The coarse part that will not go through the cloth 
may be thrown away. The mixture is best put on the 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 THE PARASITES OF PLANTS 
plants with a spraying pump. (Copper sulfate is poison- 
ous, although less so than Paris green.) 
Oat Smut and Wheat Smut.— The oat smut or wheat 
smut attacks the plant if the seed that is planted is 
smutty. To prevent this, it is necessary to destroy the 
smut fungi on the seed before planting. The best rem- 
edy for this disease is formaldehyde. ‘This is a chemical 
that may be purchased at the drug store. One pound 
of formaldehyde to fifty gallons of water will give the 
proper strength. Soak the grain in this chemical for 
about twenty minutes, 
and then spread it out 
so that it may dry with- 
out heating. 
It is probable that 
farmers suffer a loss of 
fully one-fifth of their 
oats and wheat through 
the growth of smut on 
the grain. This loss 
Fic, 26— Making Bordeaux mixture. may be entirely pre- 
vented by the use of formaldehyde as directed. The 
same treatment will prevent potato scab. 
Parasites are Numerous.—The harmful parasites of 
plants are so numerous that we can not name them all 
here. The methods used for destroying or preventing 
insects and fungi are also numerous. The farmer and 
the gardener may obtain books that name the leading 
parasites that injure each crop, and that give the best 
known methods of avoiding damage from them. It is 
necessary to keep careful watch for harmful parasites,   
-P-A-G-E-69
  
2 
THE PARASITES OF PLANTS 61 
otherwise they may do much harm before their presence 
is discovered. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Plants are often injured by parasites,— that is, by ani- 
mals or other plants that live on or within them. 
Most insects that eat the leaves of plants may be de- 
stroyed by poisoning the leaves with Paris green mixed 
with water or land plaster. 
Many insects that suck out the sap of plants, without 
eating the leaves, may be destroyed by being sprinkled 
with strong soap suds, tobacco water, or a mixture of 
kerosene and water. 
Many injurious fungi may be prevented by spraying 
the plants on which the damage is feared with the Bor- 
deaux mixture. 
The use of formaldehyde may prevent the growth of 
smut on oats and wheat. 
The farmer and gardener may learn from books about 
many harmful parasites not here named, and how to pre- 
vent damage from them.

  18. SEEDS AND SOIL WATER. 
Illustrative material: Put a few common navy beans into a 
seed tester. This consists of a layer-cake tin, two pieces of 
rather thick cloth, and a piece of galvanized sheet iron or tin 
large enough to fit loosely into the cake tin. (A common table 
plate, covered with a pane of glass, will take the place of the 
cake tin and the sheet iron cover.) The cloths should be boiled 
for ten minutes before they are used as this aids in keeping out 
mold. Wring them out until only moderately wet; place one 
over the bottom of the plate or tin; put the seeds on this; cover 
them with the other cloth; put on the cover; and set the tester 
in a warm place. 
Place a few beans upon a small piece of damp cloth or blot- 
ting paper, cover them with an inverted tumbler and place the 
whole beside the seed tester. 
Seeds Swollen.— If we place a few navy beans, or 
other thin-skinned seeds, between the moistened cloths

of a seed tester, as shown in Figure 27, set the tester in 
a warm room for twenty-four hours, and then examine 
the seeds, we shall find them swollen to nearly twice their 
62
-P-A-G-E-71
  
SEEDS AND SOIL WATER 63 
former size. The seeds have swelled because they have 
taken in, or absorbed, some of the water from the cloths. 
When a dry sponge is soaked in water, it also swells, 
and so does most dry vegetable or animal material. 
Seeds Surrounded with Water.— The beans under the 
tumbler (Figure 27), have also swelled some, but not so 
much as those in the seed tester. The beans in the seed 
tester have swelled more because they have had a wet 
cloth both above and below them, while those under the 
tumbler had the wet surface below only. 
Press Soil about Seeds.— When seeds are planted in 
moist soil, they absorb water from the soil, just as in the 
seed tester they absorb water from the moist cloths. As 
the beans in the seed tester absorbed water faster than 
those under the tumbler, so seeds planted in moist soil 
will absorb water faster if the soil is pressed closely 
around them than if it is left loose. More of the par- 
ticles will touch the surface of the seed, and so the water 
from the soil particles can enter the seed at more points 
at the same time. The water will also travel faster over 
the soil particles toward the seed, because the pressing 
brings the soil particles closer together. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Most seeds absorb water freely when placed in contact 
with it. 
The more of the surface of seeds that is in contact with 
the wet medium, the faster do they absorb water. 
Seeds absorb water from moist soil faster when the 
soil is closely pressed about them than when it is left 
loose.
-P-A-G-E-72
14. SEEDS CAN NOT GERMINATE WITHOUT 
AIR. 
Illustrative material: Two shallow dishes or saucers, two 
tumblers, and a few grains of wheat. 
Half fill two wide-mouthed bottles or two jelly cups with soil 
that is wet enough to be easily worked up in the hands like soft 
' putty. Pack the soil in one of the dishes until the air is well 
pressed out of it, adding enough soil to make the dish half full 
when packed. Leave the soil loose in the other dish. Put a 
few wheat grains on the surface of the soil in each dish and 
cover these to the depth of about a quarter of an inch in the 
dish with the soil unpacked and with packed soil in the other 
dish. Close both dishes and put them in a warm place. 
Air Necessary for Germination.— Figure 28 shows 
two shallow dishes, in each of which kernels of wheat 
were placed. Enough 
water was then added 
to the right-hand dish 
to cover the kernels to 
about half their depth, 
and to the left-hand 
dish to cover them to 
twice their depth. The 
dishes were then set in 
a warm room and coy- 
ered with tumblers to prevent evaporation of the water. 
After two days, the kernels in the right-hand dish had 
germinated, while none of those in the left-hand dish 
had done so. Why did not the kernels in the left-hand 
64   
  Fic, 28.— Effect of air on seeds,
-P-A-G-E-73
SEEDS CAN NOT GERMINATE WITHOUT AIR 65 
dish germinate? They were in contact with water in 
both dishes, and both dishes were kept in a warm 
room. In the right-hand dish, however, the kernels 
were in contact with plenty of air, while in the other 
dish most of the air was shut out. We all know that 
seeds will not germinate so long as they are dry, and that, 
even though they have plenty of water, they will not ger- 
minate in a very cold place. But this experiment shows 
that, when wheat seeds have plenty of water and warmth, 
they will not germinate unless they also have plenty of 
air. The same is true of most of the seeds commonly 
planted on the farm or in the garden. 
Some Seeds Contain Air.— The seeds of some plants 
that grow in water, as the water lily and rice, and of a few 
land plants, as Indian corn, may germinate under water. 
Dry seeds usually contain pores that are filled with air, 
and water also usually contains some air. These seeds 
are able to get enough air from their pores and from the 
water, to enable them to germinate. If they are soaked 
for a time in cold water to expel the air within them, 
and are then sealed up in a fruit jar of water from which 
the air has been expelled by long boiling, they can not 
germinate. No seeds can germinate without access to air. 
Packed Soil Does Not Admit Air.— In the experiment 
shown in Figure 29, a few radish seeds were planted in 
soil that was wet enough to be easily worked up in the 
hands, like soft putty. The soil was then packed down 
closely around the seeds in one of the dishes, and left 
loose in the other. We now see that the radish seeds have 
germinated in the loose soil, while they have germinated 
very poorly, if at all, in the packed soil. They failed to

Fic. 29.— Roots need air. them, it shuts out toe 
much air. Planted seeds should not be watered so often 
as to keep the spaces in the soil filled with water. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Few seeds can germinate unless they have access to 
plenty of air. 
Seeds of some plants can germinate under water, by 
using the air within them, and by absorbing air from the 
water. Seeds that contain no air can not germinate in 
water that contains no air. 
Seeds should not be planted in a clayey soil that is wet 
enough to become, with slight pressure, like soft putty. 
Planted seeds should not be so freely watered that the 
pores in the soil are kept filled with water.

15. PACKING THE SOIL ABOUT PLANTED 
SEEDS. 
Illustrative material: Place an inch or more of damp garden 
soil in each of two pint fruit jars, and put twenty navy beans on 
the soil in each jar. Cover them to the depth of about two 
inches with the soil, packing it down firmly in one jar, and 
leaving it as loose as possible in the other. Screw the caps on 
loosely on both jars, and place them in a warm place. 
Packing Loam About Seeds.— If we plant a few live 
navy beans in damp (not wet) garden soil in each of two 
jars, and then pack the soil down closely around the beans 
in one of the jars, leaving it as loose as possible in the 
other, and set both jars in a warm room for two days, we 
shall generally find that a larger number of the beans have 
germinated in the jar in which the soil was packed than 
in the other jar. 
Absorb Water Faster.— We learned from Lesson 14 
that, when we press the soil closely about seeds, the seeds 
absorb water and swell faster than if we leave them loose. 
The seeds can not germinate until they have taken up all 
the water they can hold. Since packing the soil about 
them enables them to absorb water faster, it also enables 
them to germinate sooner, if the soil is not too wet. 
Field Illustration Figure 30 shows a picture of a 
part of a recently planted grain field. This field was 
sown by hand, and then harrowed to cover the seed. 
Wherever the man that drove the team stepped, the grain

  68 PACKING THE SOIL ABOUT PLANTED SEEDS 
has come up better than elsewhere, because the man’s 
weight pressed the soil closely about the seed. Farmers 
and gardeners have often noticed this fact, and so they 
have devised various means for packing the soil over 
planted seeds. 
Testimony of a Gardener.— Gardeners often walk with 
very short steps over a row of planted seeds, placing the- 
heel of one foot against the toe of the other, so as to step 
on every part of the row. A very successful gardener 
once wrote, “ As an experiment, I sowed twelve rows of 
sweet corn and 
twelve rows of 
beets, treading in, 
after sowing, every 
alternate row of 
each. In both cases, 
those trodden in 
Fie. 30 Effect of pressing the earth closely Came up in four 
Spor days, while those 
unfirmed remained twelve days before starting, and 
would not then have germinated had not rain fallen.” 
Rollers.— When farmers plant corn with the hand hoe, 
they commonly strike the soil with the flat side of the hoe, 
or often they step on each “hill” after covering it, to 
press the soil about the seed. When grain is sown in dry 
weather, a heavy roller is commonly driven over the land 
to pack the soil about the seed. Grain sowing machines, 
and cornplanters, often have little iron rollers attached 
to them to press the soil over the seed. Gardeners often 
use hand rollers for this purpose. 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
PACKING THE SOIL ABOUT PLANTED SEEDS 69 
Pressing with a Board—— Very small seeds, as those 
of tobacco and petunia plants, are often sown on the sur- 
face of the ground without being afterward covered with 
soil. In such cases, the sower commonly lays over them 
a board on which he walks, to press the soil, and to bring 
the seed into very close contact with it. 
Evaporation Makes Packing Necessary.— If the soil 
were always damp on the surface, it would not be neces- 
sary to pack it over the seed. But, since the surface tends 
to dry out by evaporation to the depth of an inch or two, 
planted seeds need to absorb their water quickly in dry 
weather, or the soil may become so dry about them that 
they can not secure enough water for germination. In 
this case, the seeds must wait until rain comes, or until 
watered, and thus the crop will be delayed or it may be 
entirely cut off. Thus, the simple act of pressing. the 
soil about the planted seeds will sometimes save a valu- 
able crop that would otherwise be lost. 
Plant Soon after Plowing.— When ground is plowed 
in dry weather, the dry surface soil is turned under, and 
the more moist soil from below is brought to the top. If 
seeds are planted at once in this moist top soil, and the 
soil is well pressed about them, they will almost always 
germinate before the surface becomes too dry, even in 
time of rather severe drought. It is important in dry 
weather, therefore, to plant seeds as soon as possible 
after the ground is plowed and prepared. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Pressing the soil about planted seeds hastens ger- 
mination, and sometimes saves a crop. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  
7O PACKING THE SOIL ABOUT PLANTED SEEDS 
The pressing is done by stepping on the planted ground, 
or on a board laid upon it, by pressing the ground with a 
hoe, or by rolling it with a roller made for the purpose. 
When freshly-plowed ground is planted, and the soil 
is well pressed about the seeds, germination rarely fails, 
even in very dry weather.

  16. SEED TESTING. 
Illustrative material: Procure an ounce of clover seed and as 
many small patty pans as there are pupils. Put 100 seeds of 
red or white clover in the seed tester. Put in enough seeds of 
oats, barley, Indian corn, peas, beans, and cucumber or melon 
to supply each pupil with at least four of each kind. 
Before taking up the lesson, remove the cover of the seed 
tester, and the upper cloth, and pass the open tester about the 
class, after which remove, with a forceps, the clover seeds that 
have failed to germinate, leaving all the other seeds. Count the 
ungerminated clover seeds, and let the pupils subtract the num- 
ber from 100. Explain what is meant by the per cent of 
germination; i. e., the number of seeds per hundred that will 
germinate. 
At the close of the lesson, give each pupil a thimble full of 
clover seed in a patty pan, and require each one to separate them 
into two classes, putting only clover seed in one place, and 
everything not clover seed in another. 
Use of Seed Tester.— We learned in Lesson 13 that 
beans, placed between the moist cloths of a seed tester, 
absorb water freely from the cloths. We now learn that 
seeds of various kinds germinate as freely in the seed 
tester, as when-planted in moist soil. By means of the 
seed tester, we can easily find out, before we plant them, 
whether or not a sample of seeds can germinate. 
Age Affects Germination— Not all seeds can ger- 
minate, even though they appear all right outside. Seeds 
germinate less freely as they become old, and, after a 
certain age, they lose their power to germinate. Some 
kinds of seeds retain their power to germinate much 
longer than others. 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 SEED TESTING 
  
Other Causes Affecting Germination.— Seeds may fail 
to germinate from other causes than old age. Some- 
times they are sorted when too damp, and so become 
musty ; such seeds often fail to germinate. In the pump- 
kin, cucumber, and certain other plants, the seed shells 
are sometimes empty. Seeds of Indian corn sometimes 
reeze before they become dry, and so lose their vitality.

For these reasons, it is best to test seeds before planting 
them, unless we know that they will germinate. 
How to Make and Use a Seed Tester.— A seed tester 
for use at home may be made of two table plates, and 
two circular pieces of thick cloth large enough to cover 
the bottom of the plates. Put the cloths in boiling water 
for a few minutes before using them, to kill the spores
-P-A-G-E-81
  SEED TESTING 73 
of fungi they may contain. Wring them out until 
only moderately wet, spread one over the bottom of one 
of the plates, and put 100 of the seeds to be tested upon 
it. Cover these with the other cloth, and place the second 
plate on the one containing the seeds, taking care that the 
rims are together. Set the tester ina warm room. Look 
at the seeds from time to time and remove all that have 
germinated, When all seem to have germinated that 
will, subtract the number that failed to germinate from 
100. The remainder will show the per cent of live seeds 
the sample contains. Boil the cloths again before using 
them for a second test. 
Importance of Testing Clover Seed Before Purchasing. 
—As we have learned, the clover crop is a very impor- 
tant one to the farmer in many countries. Most farmers 
need to buy their clover seed, and it is generally pretty 
high in price. It is important, therefore, to test clover 
seed before buying it. It is well to procure several dif- 
ferent samples from the seed store, noting the price at 
which each can be purchased. Some of these samples 
will probably contain more dirt, sticks and weed seeds 
than others, and in some the clover seeds will germinate 
better than others. The best sample to buy will be the 
one that gives the largest quantity of live clover seeds for 
_ the lowest price. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Seeds may fail to germinate from being too old, from 
having become musty in storage, from having been frozen 
before they became dry, and from being imperfectly 
formed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 SEED TESTING 
The age at which seeds lose their vitality varies much 
with different kinds. 
A seed tester for home use may be made of two table 
plates and two pieces of thick cloth. 
As a rule, seeds should be tested before planting. 
High-priced seeds should be tested before they are bought.

17%. HOW SEEDS “COME UP.” 
Illustrative material: Four glass jars, garden soil, and seeds 
of wheat, radish, pea and bean. 
Planting the Seeds.— Figure 32 shows four fruit jars, 
each of which contains a different kind of plant. About 
two inches in depth of moist garden soil was put into each 
jar. Ten kernels of wheat were then placed on the soil 
in jar No. 1, ten seeds of radish in jar No. 2, ten seeds 
of pea in jar No. 3, and ten seeds of navy bean in jar 
No. 4. The seeds in all the jars were then covered about 
  
    
I 2 3 4 Frc. 32.— Experiment with seeds. 
an inch deep with moist soil, after which the jars were 
closed and set in a warm room, 
Wheat and Radish Plantlets.— The seeds have now 
germinated, and the plantlets have just come up,— that 
is, they have just appeared above the surface of the soil. 
We may see that the plantlets are acting quite differently 
in the different jars. In jar No. 1, the blades of wheat 
75 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  “COME UP” 76 HOW SEEDS 
have reached the surface with very little disturbance of 
the soil. In jar No. 2, the radish plantlets seem to have 
had a harder time in coming up. Their clumsy seed 
leaves have lifted and moved the soil in places, and left it 
in slight ridges. 
The Pea Plantlets—— The pea plantlets, in jar No. 3, 
seem to have behaved more like those of the wheat. 
Each appears first as a slender stem to which tiny leaves 
are attached, and this stem seems to have found its way 
among the soil particles without moving them much, 
‘There are no thick, clumsy seed leaves, as in the radish, 
although its stem is much thicker than that of the wheat 
and quite different from it in appearance. 
The Bean Plantlets.— The plantlets of the bean seem 
to have had the hardest time of all in reaching the sur- 
face. Instead of sending up slender stems, like the peas, 
or thin blades, like the wheat, the now greatly swollen 
beans seem to have been lifted bodily out of the soil, while 
the earth was lifted to make way for them. The plant- 
lets seem to have come up back foremost, with the tops 
pointing downward and the beans seem to have divided 
into halves. A little later the stems straighten up and 
the halves spread apart, each half becoming a very clumsy 
seed leaf, a little like that of the radish, but much larger. 
Two Types.— The different ways in which these plant- 
lets reached the surface illustrate two types. The wheat 
and pea belong to one type, in which the plantlet grows — 
directly upward, without being hindered by clumsy seed 
leaves. The seeds of such plants may be rather deeply 
planted, and still their stems will be able to reach the 
surface. The radish and bean belong to the other type,
-P-A-G-E-85
ae ee Me By ee REEMA he BAe 
‘ HOW SEEDS “ COME UP” 77 
in which the greater part of what was once the seed is 
forced up through the soil, and appears above the surface. 
If the seeds of such plants are planted deeper than four 
or five times their thickness, the plantlets will be unable to 
lift the soil above them, and so can not come up at all. 
To this class of plants belong, besides the bean and radish, 
the beet, parsnip, carrot, squash, cucumber, melon, clover, 
buckwheat, and, in fact, almost all the common farm and 
garden crops, except plants of the pea family and of the 
grass family. 
Rule for Depth of Planting.— The following rule may 
be safely followed for the seeds commonly planted on the 
farm and in the garden: Seeds of plants that come up 
without thick seed leaves, as Indian corn, wheat, rye, 
oats, barley, millet and other grasses, peas, lentils, and 
vetches, may be safely covered to ten times their thickness. 
Other seeds should not be covered more than five times 
their thickness. As a rule, no seeds should be covered 
deeper than is needful to insure a supply of soil moisture. 
It is often desirable to sow a crop in the orchard in sum- 
mer, when the soil is rather dry; for this purpose, it is 
important to choose one the seed of which may be deeply 
planted. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Plants may be divided into two classes with reference to 
the manner in which their plantlets rise through the soil. 
In the pea and grass families of plants, the plantlet 
appears as a slender, pointed shoot that may easily work 
its way among the soil particles. Seeds of this class may
-P-A-G-E-86
‘ 78 HOW SEEDS “COME UP” 
be planted rather deeply, and so are suitable for planting 
in summer when the soil is rather dry. 
In most other farm and garden crops, the plantlet ap- 
pears with two clumsy seed leaves that can not rise easily 
through the soil. Seeds of this class should not be 
planted deeper than to four or five times their thickness. 
No seeds should be planted deeper than seems neces- 
sary to insure contact with enough soil moisture to enable 
them to germinate.
-P-A-G-E-87
18. IT IS WISE TO PLANT THE LARGEST SEEDS. 
Illustrative material: Three jars, soil, a few beans and clover 
seeds. 
Small Seeds Not Strong— A few navy beans were 
planted an inch deep in jar No. 1; a few clover seeds were 
planted the same depth in jar No. 2; and a few clover 
seeds were planted a quarter of an inch deep in jar No. 3. 
  Fic. 33.— Experiment with beans and clover seed. 
As appears in Figure 33 the plantlets from the beans 
and from the clover planted a quarter of an inch deep 
have come up well, while those from the clover planted 
an inch deep have not. 
Large Seeds are Strong.— Every perfect seed contains 
a plantlet, and some food to nourish the plantlet during 
germination. (See Figure 34.) The larger the seed is, 
79 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
I 
80 IT IS WISE TO PLANT THE LARGEST SEEDS 
as a rule, the stronger is the plantlet, and the more plenti- 
ful is its food supply. This is true of different seeds of 
the same kind as of different kinds 
of seed. The bean plantlets 
in Figure 33 were able to come 
up through an inch of soil be 
cause they were well supplied with 
food and were strong. The 
clover seeds, as compared with the 
beans, are very small, and the 
clover plantlets, as compared with 
the bean plantlets, are very weak. 
The clover plantlets were unable 
to force their way through an 
Fro. 34— Diagram of a seed. inch of soil, but, as we see by look- 
ing at jar No. 3, they can grow through a quarter inch 
of soil. Asa rule, the larger a seed is, the deeper it may 
be covered in planting. 
Planting Very Small Seeds.— As we learned from the 
last lesson, plantlets that bring up thick seed leaves to the 
surface can not grow through so much soil as those that 
do not. It follows that the small-seeded plants whose 
plantlets bring up their seed leaves must have their seeds 
planted in the least depth of soil of all. The clover plant 
belongs to this class, hence clover seed must be planted 
very shallow, or the plants will not come up well. The 
seeds of tobacco and petunia are much smaller than clover 
seed, and they lift their seed leaves in coming up. It is 
unwise to cover the seeds of these plants at all. As we 
learned in Lesson 15, they are commonly sown on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  
IT IS WISE TO PLANT THE LARGEST SEEDS 81 
surface and pressed into the soil, the surface being kept 
moist by frequent watering. 
Profit in Planting the Largest Seeds.— Gardeners who 
grow radishes and lettuce under glass for the winter mar- 
ket find that, when they sift their seed and plant only the 
largest, their crops mature so much more evenly than 
when they sow the seeds without sifting, that the plants 
become fit to sell several days earlier. It is sometimes 
possible to grow one extra crop in the winter in this way. 
Reject Poorly-formed Seeds.— Farmers pass their seed 
grain through a fanning mill, to take out the smallest and 
most shrunken kernels. Many reject the smaller kernels 
from the tip ends of their ears of seed corn. By growing 
their crops from the largest seeds, they secure a larger 
yield of grain than they would if they planted the seeds 
without sifting. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Every perfect seed contains a plantlet and a food sup- 
ply. 
The larger the seed, as a rule, the more plentiful is the 
food supply, and the stronger is the plantlet. 
The larger the seed is, as a rule, the deeper it may be 
covered in planting. 
Very small seeds, whose plantlets bring up their seed 
leaves, should be covered but slightly, if at all. 
Gardeners who grow radishes and lettuce for the win- 
ter market find it to their advantage to plant only the 
largest seeds. 
It is generally possible to grow larger crops by plant- 
ing the largest seeds.

  19. REARING PLANTS FROM BUDS. 
Illustrative material: A potato tuber, cuttings of the currant 
or grape vine, a cion and a small branch of the apple tree, and 
a bit of grafting cloth. 
Roots Come from Buds.— We have now learned how 
to rear young plants by planting their seeds. Many kinds 
of plants may also be reared from buds. Some kinds are 
reared from buds more often than from seeds. We 
  Fic. 35.— A layer. 
learned in Lesson 5 that every live part of a stem ter- 
minates in a bud. In many plants, a bud, with a certain 
part of the stem beneath it, if kept for a time in a favor- 
able place, will form roots of its own, and thus will be- . 
come a new plant. Pieces of the roots of some plants, 
as the plum and cherry, if given a good chance, may also 
form buds on each piece, which will develop in due time 
into leafy stems. 
Layering.— One of the simplest ways of rearing plants 
is by layering. Without being cut off, one or more 
branches of a plant are covered with soil. Sometimes the 
82 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
aati 
REARING PLANTS FROM BUDS 83 
branches are bent down and covered ; sometimes the soil is 
piled up around them. (Figure 35.) Branches thus 
“treated are called Jayers. It is better not to cover 
the tips of the branches. In a _ few 
weeks, roots will grow from near the buds 
in the covered parts of the stems. The 
stems can then be cut off below the roots 
and be planted in a new place. The cur- 
rant, gooseberry, grape, quince, and many . 
other plants, may be propagated,— that is, 
increased in number,— in this way. 
Propagation by Cuttings. A second 
way of rearing plants from buds is by cut- 
tings. A cutting, which is a portion of a 
stem having at least one healthy bud, is 
planted in the soil. Roots may then grow 
from the stem, or from the base of the bud, 
while the bud expands into a leafy stem. 
Cuttings made during fall, winter, or early 
spring, are called dormant cuttings. ((Fig- 
ure 36.) The grape, currant, orange, 
and many other shrubs, are propagated from 
dormant cuttings. The potato is reared 
from cuttings of the tuber, which is a mod- 
ified stem. Cuttings of woody plants may 
be made in the fall or spring, from wood 
that grew the summer before. They are ™* 35°C 
commonly planted in spring in mellow soil, up to their 
top bud. (Figure 37.) Cuttings of some plants, es- 
pecially in cold climates, are better made in the fall, then 
stored in moist sand or soil, and planted in the spring. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 REARING PLANTS FROM BUDS 
Green Cuttings.— Most plants can be reared from so- 
called green cuttings. (Figure 38.) These are made 
from a tender part of the stem, and each one has a leaf or 
a part of a leaf attached. The leaf is left on to prepare 
food for the growth of roots. The cuttings are com- 
monly planted in a greenhouse bed formed of clean, rather 
coarse sand that is kept wet. The sand is usually kept a

little warmer than the air above it by heating pipes below 
the bed. The cuttings are shaded when the sun shines. 
After roots form, the little plants are potted in small flower 
pots. Green cuttings of many plants will form roots in 
a saucer of coarse sand, in a sunny window, if the pores 
in the sand are kept filled with clean water. 
Propagation by Grafting— A third way of rearing 
plants from buds is by grafting. This is chiefly used to 
cause fruit trees to bear a better variety of fruit. Ifa
-P-A-G-E-93
REARING PLANTS FROM BUDS 85 
farmer has a tree that bears poor apples, and he wishes 
it to bear good apples, he can graft the tree over. Todo 
this, he cuts a few young twigs from some tree that bears 
choice apples, and grafts them into his tree, and, if his 
work succeeds, his tree will bear the choice apples in about 
three years. The tree to be grafted over is called the 
stock and the twigs to be grafted into the stock are called 
cions. 
Cutting Cions.— The cions are best cut late in fall or 
early in spring from firm wood that grew the summer be- 
fore. Sometimes they are not cut 
until they are needed for grafting. 
If cut early, they should be kept, 
until warm spring weather, packed 
in a box with plenty of rather dry 
leaves, in a cool, somewhat damp, 
cellar. The leaves should be 
weighted down, to keep them close 
to the cions. If the main limbs of 
the tree to be grafted overarehalfan |, ee

use the cleft-graft; other-

better.

flatwise across the center of the end of one of the stubs 
and drive it in until the stub splits open wide enough to 
admit a lead pencil. Next, with a sharp knife, 
cut two pieces shaped like Figure 39 from one 
of the cions, each piece having two perfect buds, 
pointing as shown. Insert these into the split 
in the stock as shown in Figure 40. Be careful 
to place the cions in the cleft so that the line be- 
tween the bark and wood on the stock touches 
the like or corresponding line on the outside of 
the cion, as shown in Figure 41. Then cover

W hip-Grafting.— In 
whip-grafting, the splice is 
made where the stock and 
the cion are of about the 
same thickness. The cuts — Fis: 43-—Whip-grafting. 
should be made with a sharp knife, as shown in Figure 
43,a. They should then be slipped together, as shown

in Fig. 43, b, after which the splice should be tightly 
wrapped with a narrow strip of grafting cloth, as shown 
in Figure 43, c. 
Grafting wax is made by melting together one ounce 
of beef tallow, two ounces of beeswax, and four ounces 
of rosin. Pour the melted mass into water, grease the 
hands, and work it, when it is cool enough, like molasses 
candy, until it is the color of manilla paper. Grafting 
cloth is made by painting melted grafting wax on thin 
muslin. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Most plants may be propagated from their buds. 
Many plants may be propagated by layering,— that is, 
by covering their lower branches with earth. When 
roots are formed, the branches may be cut off and trans- 
planted. 
Certain plants may be propagated from cuttings made 
of dormant wood. When cuttings of such plants are 
planted in mellow soil, the buds will expand, and roots 
will grow from the stem. 
Most plants may be propagated in the greenhouse from 
green cuttings. Green cuttings of many house plants 
will root in a saucer of wet sand in a sunny window. 
A fruit tree may often be caused to bear better fruit by 
grafting. A part from the tree that bears the desired 
fruit is placed in close contact with a part of the tree it is 
desired to graft, so that the live parts of the bark in the 
two parts come together. The wounded surfaces are 
then covered with grafting wax.

20. TRANSPLANTING. 
Illustrative material: A tree that has been recently dug for 
transplanting. Wash the roots clean and let the pupils see how 
many places they can find where rootlets have been broken off. 
If possible, give the pupils a practical demonstration lesson in 
tree planting out of doors. 
Method of Transplanting.— It is sometimes desirable to 
remove a living plant, the roots of which are growing in 
the natural soil, to another place. This process is called 
transplanting. ‘The more common method of transplant~ 
ing is to take the roots or a part of them out of the soil, 
and to replant them in a new place. Sometimes a quan- 
tity of the soil that contains the roots is removed to the 
new place. 
Rough Handling Destroys Fine Roots.— Figure 44 
shows a young oat plant, the roots of which were washed 
out of the soil by a gentle stream of water. Most of the 
roots were saved. Figure 45 shows another oat plant, 
with which an attempt was made to draw the roots from 
the wet soil. Most of the roots were torn off. The 
latter picture shows about what happens when trees or 
other plants are taken up by the common methods. Only 
a few of the oldest and largest roots came up with the 
plant. 
Rules for Transplanting.— We learned from Lesson 5 
that the water of plants is absorbed by root hairs which 
grow on the youngest roots only. When a plant is taken 
up for transplanting, as shown in Figure 45, its power 
88
-P-A-G-E-97
TRANSPLANTING 89 
for taking up water is mostly destroyed until some new 
roots are formed. Transplanting, as commonly per- 
formed, is therefore a dangerous operation for the plant. 
If the following rules are observed, however, the plant 
seldom fails to grow. 
   Fic. 44.— Roots of oat- Fic. 45.— Oat plant with

(1) Trees and shrubs that drop their leaves in autumn 
should be transplanted only while their leaves are off. 
We learned in Lesson 3 that the water taken up by the 
roots is mostly transpired through the leaves. A tree or 
shrub without leaves needs very little water, because it 
transpires very little. Damage to the roots when the 
leaves are off is far less serious than when the plant is in 
full leaf. In climates having wet falls and mild winters, 
trees and shrubs are better transplanted in the fall; in 
other climates, spring is the better time.

(2) Take up the plant with the least possible harm to 
the roots. With trees and shrubs, enough earth should 
be removed to uncover some of the roots to their ends if 
possible. The younger the roots are, the more readily do 
they send out new roots, hence as many of the younger 
  Fic. 46.— Bruised root, Fic. 47.— Cleanly cut root. 
roots should be retained as possible. The roots should 
be kept moist while they are out of the soil. 
(3) Trim of broken and mangled roots with a sharp 
knife before replanting. New roots start more freely 
from a smoothly cut end than from a rough and bruised 
one. (Figures 46 and 47.) 
(4) Cut off some of the branches before replanting. 
Since some of the roots have been lost in taking the plant
-P-A-G-E-99
  
TRANSPLANTING gI 
up, the remaining roots will not often be able to supply 
so much water as is needed unless some of the branches 
are also removed. There is more danger of leaving on 
too many branches than of cutting off too many. 
(5) Make the hole large enough to receive the roots 
easily. Bending the roots to make them enter the hole 
. may cause disease. Loosen the soil in the bottom of the 
hole, and put in some surface soil. Replant the tree or 
~ shrub at least as deep as it grew before it was taken up. 
(6) Dip the roots in water before replanting. This 
will permit the moist soil to come in the closest contact 
with the roots. 
(7) Pack the moist soil closely about the roots. We 
learned in Lesson 15 that packing the soil about planted 
seeds promotes germination. For the same reason, pack- 
ing the soil about the roots promotes growth. 
(8) If the soil is rather dry, add a pailful or two or 
water after packing the soil about the roots and before 
putting in all the dirt. The amount of water will depend 
upon the size of the tree or shrub and the dryness of the 
soil. Put in the rest of the soil without treading it down. 
If there are sods, put them on grass side down. 
(9) Some plants, as cabbage and tomato, and the 
evergreen tree, must be transplanted in leaf. Such plants 
should generally be shaded for a time. 
(10) Mulch the soil about the tree or shrub if the 
climate is subject to drought in spring.

21. HOW TO IMPROVE PLANTS. 
Illustrative material: Show a number of individual plants of 
the same kind, or of branches from as many plants, and require 
the pupils to search out the differences shown by the same part 
in different specimens. Show also a number of ears of Indian 
corn of different forms and let each pupil pick out the best ear 
according to his own ideal. Always require the reasons for 
the choice. 
Plants Not Alike.—If we go out into a field of ripe 
Indian corn and try to find two corn plants that are alike 
in all respects, we shall fail. One will be a little taller 
than the other; one will have a thicker stalk than the 
other ; or one will have a longer ear than the other. If we 
try to pick out, from a pile of husked corn two ears that 
are just alike, we shall fail again. One ear will be thicker, 
or longer, or will have smaller kernels, than the other. 
We shall even find it hard to select two kernels from the 
same ear that are just alike. Two plants rarely, if ever, 
grow just alike. 
Select Seeds with a Purpose.— Although two plants 
rarely grow alike, the plants that grow from the seed of 
a parent plant are usually more nearly like the parent than 
they are like any other plant. For example, if one pea 
plant in a row bears longer and more slender pods than 
any other, the plants grown from the seeds in these long 
and slender pods is likely to produce long and slender 
pods also. Some of them will probably be a little more 
long and slender than any of the parent pods. If we 
92
-P-A-G-E-101
HOW TO IMPROVE PLANTS 93 
keep on planting the peas from the longest and most 
slender pods, we shall by and by have a variety of which 
- the pods will be much longer and more slender than those 
of common peas. Thus we can change a variety of plant 
by planting year after year the seeds from only those 
plants that show some definite variation in a marked 
degree. : 
Improvement by Selection.— Figure 48 shows the re- 
sult that has come from saving seeds of the sugar beet

from only those plants that had the most sugar in the 
juice. When the beet was first used for making sugar, 
the juice from the sweetest beets had only about eight 
per cent of sugar in it (Figure 48, a); but, by testing 
the juice of every root, and saving for seed only those 
of which the juice contained the most sugar, the amount 
of sugar has slowly been increased until now the sweetest 
   
-P-A-G-E-102
    
94 HOW TO IMPROVE PLANTS 
roots contain about eighteen per cent of sugar in their 
juice (Figure 48, b). 
Consider the Plant in Selection.— We learned from 
Lesson 18 that it is wise to plant the largest seeds. It is 
also wise to select our seeds, as far as possible, from the 
plants that suit us best. The farmer should select his 
Indian corn for seed from only those plants that have the 
kind of ear and stalk that he would like to have in his 
whole field the next year. The gardener should save 
his tomato seeds, if at all, from only the fruits that suit 
him best, that grow on the plants that suit him best. 
The plant should be considered, as well as the fruit. 
To Raise the Best Crops.— 1f the cultivator is careful 
to select his seeds from the best plants only, his crops will 
tend to improve; otherwise, they will tend to become 
poorer. His land not only should be well fertilized and 
cultivated, but should be planted to only the choicest 
seeds, if he would raise the finest crops. The best farmer 
or gardener is not satisfied with common crops. He 
aims to raise the best of everything, and to raise it by 
the best methods. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Two plants rarely, if ever, grow just alike. 
The offspring of a plant is usually more nearly like 
the parent than like any other plant. 
We can change a variety of plant, by planting year 
after year the seeds from only those plants that show 
some definite variation in a marked degree. 
The sugar content of the juice of the sugar beet has 
been increased from about eight per cent to about eight-
-P-A-G-E-103
  HOW TO IMPROVE PLANTS 95 
een per cent by using for seed growing only roots that 
were very rich in sugar. 
In selecting seeds, the whole plant should be consid- 
ered, and not simply the part for which the plant is grown. 
One way to improve crops is to practice careful seed 
selection.

22. THE FLOWER AND ITS PARTS. 
Illustrative material: As many flowers, of some kind that 
‘ show well the calyx, corolla, stamens and pistils, as there are 
pupils in the class; a good pocket lens. The larger the flowers 
are that show these parts the better. 
Necessity of Flowers.— Many flowers are among the 
most beautiful and delicate of natural objects. While 
flowers delight us by their beauty and fragrance, they 
serve a very important use both to man and to the plant 
that bears them. Without flowers, plants could not bear 
the fruits we prize so much for food, and the seeds. 
Without seeds, most kinds of plants would soon disap- 
pear, for they could form no more little plants to take 
the place of those that die. 
Parts of the Flower.— Flowers are prettiest when left 
whole, but in this lesson we are to learn the names and 
uses of the different parts of the flower, so we shall need 
to pull the flowers to pieces somewhat. A flower, when 
complete, has four principal parts, each of which has 
a name and use. These principal parts are composed of 
smaller parts, each of which also has its name. 
The Calyx and the Sepal.— Figure 49 shows a cherry 
blossom, cut through lengthwise. At the base, we find 
a green part, marked C in the figure, called the calyx. In 
some flowers, as those of the flax, the calyx is composed 
of several more or less leaflike parts, each of which is 
called a sepal. In the cherry flower, the sepals are 
96
-P-A-G-E-105
  
  THE FLOWER AND ITS PARTS 97 
united nearly to the top. The calyx is green in most 
flowers, but, in the tulip and some other plants, it is of 
another color. The ; 
calyx forms a sort of 
cup that supports the 
rest of the flower. 
The Corolla and the 
Petals— The more 
spreading part of the 
cherry blossom, marked 
cor. in Figure 49, is the Fic. 49.— Section of cherry blossom. 
corolla. In the cherry flower, the corolla consists of five 
distinct parts called petals. In many plants, as the pump- 
kin and the morning glory, the petals are united. (Fig- 
uré 50.) The corolla is usually of some 
s other color than green. This helps to 
make the flower more easily seen, so 
that insects can find it. 
The Stamens and their Parts— In- 
side the corolla is a group of slender 
organs, s. s. (Figure 49), called sta- 
mens. Each stamen consists of three 
parts: the long and slender portion at- 
Fis. 50— Calyx and tached to the calyx below, called the 
Glory: filament; the swollen portion at the top, 
called the anther; and a dustlike substance found on or 
within the anther, called the pollen. The office of the 
stamen is to produce the pollen, without which vital seeds 
can not be formed. Some flowers have more stamens 
than the cherry blossom, while others do not have so 
many.

  98 THE FLOWER AND ITS PARTS 
The Pistil and Its Parts—— The columnlike part in the 
center of the flower is called the pistil. This, also, con- 
R---- stg sists of three principal parts. (Figure 51.) 
The enlarged top is called the stigma; the 
-s+---stl egg-shaped base is called the ovary; and the 
slender part connecting the stigma and the 
ovary is called the style. The ovary con- 
tains a smaller egg-shaped part, called the 
ovule, which may later become the seed.

Fig, st—Pis’ many ovaries contain more than one ovule til of Wild 
Geranium; The pistil forms and protects the ovules ov, ovary; 
ie 3 : 
Se, situ? until they become seeds. 
Pollination When the pistil is mature, a drop of a 
sticky liquid forms on the stigma, so that a grain of pollen 
that happens to touch it sticks fast. If the pollen grain 
is from the same flower as the pistil, or from another 
flower of the same kind, it puts out a long tube that 
grows through the style into the ovary, where it comes in 
contact with the ovule, after which the ovule grows into 
a seed. (Figure 52.) The alighting of the pollen on 
the stigma is called pollination. If no pollen grain of 
the same kind alights on the stigma, the ovule does not 
become a seed, but, after a time, it perishes. 
Bees and Insects Aid in Pollination.— Bees and some 
other insects visit flowers to get honey or pollen from 
them which they use as food. In entering the flowers, 
they become more or less dusted with the pollen, and, 
as they rub against the stigma, they aid much in pollina- 
tion. These insects help flowers to form fruit or seeds, 
and so their visits to the flowers are very useful.    
   
-P-A-G-E-107
THE FLOWER AND ITS PARTS 99 
Pollen of Another Variety of Plant Sometimes Re- 
quired for Fertilization of the Ovule.— In some of our 
fruits, the pollen 
from one flower 
will not form fruit 
or seed in the pis- 
til of the same 
flower, or of an- 
other flower of the 
same variety. The 
pistil of the Bart- 
lett pear will not 
often form a fruit, 
if it receives pollen 
only from Bartlett 
pear flowers. It 
must receive pol- 
len from some 
other kind of 
pear flower than 
the Bartlett. So 
an orchard plant- 
ed entirely to 
Bartlett trees sel- 
dom bears much 
fruit. In planting 
an orchard, it is 
wise, as a rule, to 
plant trees of sev- 
fet . Fic. 52.— Fertilization of the ovule. The pol- eral varieties to len tubes pass through the stigma and style, gether finally entering the cavity of the ovary.   
 
-P-A-G-E-108
    100 THE FLOWER AND ITS PARTS 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
The object of the flowers is to produce seeds, that the 
plant may be reproduced. 
The complete flower has a calyx, a corolla, stamens, 
and a pistil or pistils. The most important parts are 
the stamens and the pistils. 
The stamens have at their top an anther, which is filled 
with a dustlike substance, called pollen. 
The pistil, at its lower part, holds the ovule or ovules 
in the ovary. 
When the pollen falls on the stigma, a growth is sent 
down through the pistil to the ovules, and they become 
seeds. 
Bees and other insects often aid in pollination. 
Some plants require the pollen from another plant of a 
different variety to make the ovules become live seeds.

23. IMPERFECT AND PERFECT FLOWERS. 
Illustrative material: Some perfect and some imperfect 
flowers of the strawberry, squash, cucumber, melon or pumpkin; 
an ear of Indian corn. 
Imperfect Flowers.— In Lesson 22, we learned that 
pollen from the anthers of a flower must find its way to 
the stigma before seeds can be produced. The pollen 
need not come from the same flower that contains the 
stigma. If it come from any flower of the same kind, 
it will answer. The flowers of some plants do not con- 
tain both stamens and pistils, but some of the flowers 
contain stamens only, and are called staminate; others 
contain pistils only, and are called pistillate. Staminate 
and pistillate flowers are called imperfect. In imperfect 
flowers, the pollen that reaches the stigma always comes 
from some other flower. 
Examples of Perfect and Imperfect Varieties.— Fig- 
ure 53 shows two strawberry blossoms. Notice that 
P flower A contains sta- 
mens (S) and pistils 
(P). This is a perfect 
flower. Flower B, how- 
ever, is imperfect — 
having pistils only.

IOI    
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 IMPERFECT AND PERFECT FLOWERS 
varieties of strawberry have perfect flowers, 
and other varieties have pistillate flowers. 
A variety that has pistillate flowers will not 
bear fruit unless plants of a variety that has 
perfect flowers are growing close by to fur- 
nish the pollen. 
Determine before Planting the Variety of 
Flowers of a Plant—By looking at the flow- 
ers of a variety of strawberry, we can tell 
whether it will fruit well if planted alone. 
If it has perfect flowers, it will; if it 
has imperfect flowers, it will not. 
Before planting a bed of strawberry 
plants we should find out whether the 
variety we desire to plant has perfect 
or imperfect flowers. If the 
plants are not in bloom, the per- 
son of whom we procure them 
will generally be able to tell us. 
Flowers of Indian Corn are 
Imperfect.— The Indian corn plant 
has imperfect flowers. The plume- 
like “tassel” that grows at the top 
of the stalk contains many flowers, 
but these flowers usually contain 
only stamens. They yield pollen in 
abundance. Most country boys and 
girls have seen the yellow pollen 
; dust on the leaves of Indian corn 
soon after the tassels form. The 
7 young ear bears the pistils, which 
Pig se-qandian corn... are the) so-called. (rsilky’ abach;

thread of the “ silk,” when it receives its grain of pollen, 
produces a kernel on the ear. If one of the threads 
fails to receive its grain of pollen, a kernel on the ear 
will be missing. By looking closely at an ear of Indian 
corn, we can tell where the silk was attached to each 
kernel. (Fig. 54.) 
Other Examples of Imperfect Flowers.— The flowers 
of the melon, cucumber, squash and pumpkin are imper-

fect. By looking closely, we can easily see the two kinds 
of flowers. Those that bear the pollen are like B, Figure 
55; while those that have the pistil are like A, Figure 55. 
Notice how many points of difference you can see in 
these two flowers. In some plants, like the maple tree 
and the hop plant, all the flowers on one plant bear sta- 
mens only, and all the flowers on other plants bear pistils 
only. The plants that bear the staminate flowers of 
course never produce any seed.  
-P-A-G-E-112
  104. IMPERFECT AND PERFECT FLOWERS 
Cross Fertilization When the pollen of one flower 
fertilizes the ovules of another flower, the action is called 
cross fertilization. This is one ofthe ways of producing 
many varieties of plants. Cross fertilization is often 
brought about by the wind or by insects, and sometimes 
by intention of the gardener. 
Plant Breeding. By crossing certain plants with 
others of a similar kind, and carefully collecting the seeds 
that result, new and improved varieties are obtained. 
When an improved variety of any plant is obtained, the 
seeds from the plant are planted and selected so as to 
make a distinct breed. 
Great progress has been made at the Experiment Sta- 
tions in making valuable breeds of wheat, oats and corn. 
The yield in each case has been increased from three to 
ten bushels per acre. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Imperfect flowers are those that lack either stamens or 
pistils. 
Some varieties of strawberry are perfect and some are 
imperfect. Strawberries having imperfect flowers must 
be planted near perfect varieties. 
Indian corn has imperfect flowers. The tassel fur- 
nishes the pollen, and the “ silk” is a part of the pistils. 
Some plants, like the maple tree and the hop, grow on 
one plant flowers having nothing but pistils, and on 
another plant flowers having nothing but stamens. 
Varieties may be produced by cross fertilization, and, 
by careful breeding, plants may be greatly improved.

24. CROPS AND WEEDS. 
Illustrative material: Samples of several of the most trouble- 
some weeds of the vicinity. Drill the pupils until they can name 
them at a glance. 
Weeds Not a Curse.—Weeds are plants that persist in 
attempting to grow where they are not wanted. It is 
Nature’s plan to have the earth thickly covered with 
plants. When men began to cultivate the soil, and to 
decide just what kinds of plants should grow in some 
chosen place, they discovered weeds. Weeds should cer- 
tainly, however, be kept out of our crops as far as possible. 
But we must not think that they were sent as a curse to 
man, for it is better to have the ground covered with 
plants, though they be weeds, than to have it bare. 
Not Room for Both.— Figure 56 shows a plant of In- 
dian corn surrounded by weeds. The roots of the corn 
and of the weeds are feeding from the same soil, and 
their stems are reaching up for the same sunlight. Surely 
there will not be enough water, food and sunlight for all, 
and so all will suffer unless some are taken out. If we 
hope to raise good corn, we must destroy the weeds. 
We learned in Lesson 11 that keeping the surface of the 
land covered with a layer of crumbled soil tends to pre- 
vent evaporation. Fortunately, the same treatment tends 
to prevent weeds from growing. The surface soil should, 
for this twofold reason, be kept well cultivated, especially 
in warm weather. 
105 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 CROPS AND WEEDS 
Annuals.— Some weeds grow up, blossom, ripen their 
seeds, and perish, all in one season. ‘These are called 
annual weeds. Weeds of this class are usually easy to 
destroy, for, if we pull them.up or cut them off at the 
surface or a little below it, they do not often grow again. 
Many of the most common garden weeds belong to this

class. Annual weeds usually seed more freely than other 
kinds. 
Biennials—— Weeds of another class grow in part one 
season and live through winter, to blossom, ripen their 
seed, and die, the next season. These are called biennial 
weeds. The well-known “ bull thistle,” so common in
-P-A-G-E-115
CROPS AND WEEDS 107 
old pastures, is of this class. These weeds are sometimes 
rather difficult to destroy the first season of their growth, 
for they are apt to grow up again after being cut off. 
If cut the second season, just before bloom, they soon die 
without yielding seed. 
Perennials.— Weeds of a third class continue to live 
and bear seed fromm year to year, unless they are destroyed. 
These are called perennial weeds. Some weeds of this 
class, as the quack grass, sow thistle, and the wild morn- 
ing glory, multiply from buds on underground parts as 
well as by seeds. Perennial weeds are the hardest of all 
to destroy. We learned in Lesson 4 that the food that 
nourishes the roots of plants is formed in the leaves. If, 
therefore, we prevent the leaves from growing, the roots 
will soon starve. This is the surest way to kill perennial 
weeds, although it is often hard to carry out. 
Constant Warfare.— Most weeds spread chiefly from 
their seeds, hence care should be taken to prevent the 
formation of weed seeds. The more thorough we are in 
keeping the weeds out of our land, the easier the work 
becomes. While we may not hope to get rid of all weeds, 
we may greatly lessen their numbers by keeping up con- 
stant warfare against them. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. 
Weeds are plants that persist in attempting to grow 
where they are not wanted. 
Weeds tend to rob plants of water, food and light. 
Annual weeds are those that live but one season. They 
are easily killed by being cut off or pulled up.
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 CROPS AND WEEDS 
Biennial weeds live two years. They are easily killed 
by being cut just before they would bloom. 
Perennial weeds live on from year to year. Some of 
them multiply both from seeds and buds. They are the 
most difficult to destroy of all weeds. By preventing all 
leaf growth, we can starve the roots of all weeds. 
Most weeds spread chiefly from their seeds.

25. MORE ABOUT WEEDS. 
The upper part of a plant of the Canada thistle is shown 
in Figure 57, 1, also a portion of the underground stem 
with its rootlets (2). 
At 3, is shown a 
single flower, with its 
seed and downy 
hairs. The seed, also, 
is shown, in 4, nat- 
ural size, and, in 5, 
as it appears under 
a microscope. 
The root of the 
Canada thistle is per- 
ennial. It sends out 
underground stems 
or rootstocks in 
every direction. It 
is because of this fact 
that it spreads so 
rapidly and is so dif- 
ficult to get rid of. 
These underground 
stems develop buds at their joints, which grow upward, 
forming new plants. Thus a single plant, if left alone 
for two or three years, may, by means of its rootstocks

alone, spread over a square rod or more of ground. It 
may spread, also, by its seeds, but this is not so likely, as 
most of the seeds will not germinate. 
The following are the best methods for the destruction 
of the Canada thistle: 
(1) After manuring the soil, plant it thickly with 
clover. When the thistles are in bloom, mow the clover, 
cutting down every’ thistle. When the clover is again 
up high enough to cut, plow it under carefully, harrow 
and roll. Keep the field well cultivated till late in the 
fall. Plant grain or grass the next spring. 
(2) Pour oil of vitriol on the stump left in the 
ground after cutting off the thistle as close as possible. 
(3) Apply salt liberally to each stump, Turn in 
sheep or goats. They will usually eat the thistles close 
to the ground, and prevent their growth. 
(4) Seed liberally with any grass that will grow well 
on the ground. The thistles may be choked out by this 
method. 
The Burdock (called, also: Great. lappa, Gobo, Lappa 
officinalis, L. major, L. edulis, etc.), Arctium Lappa.— 
This coarse, mammoth, offensive weed, with its large 
brown burs that stick to the clothing and to the coats of 
animals, is familiar to all. 
In Figure 58 is shown an illustration of a portion of 
the stems of two varieties of this plant in flower. At 1, 
is a branch of the small variety (Minor), and, at 3, one 
of the more common varieties (Major). At 2, a single 
flower is shown magnified. A shows magnified views of 
the seed, and B shows the seed natural size.

the burdock pushes itself into almost every waste 
place where the ground is rich and where the neg- 
lect of the owner per- 
mits it to exist. Its BN 
injury to crops is far 
less than that of theny 
Canada thistle, but it = 
should not be allowed 
to grow, as it is most 
unsightly and offensive, 
and its clinging burs,

Being a_ biennial 
plant, the burdock is 
not difficult to destroy. 
It dies, if left to itself, " 
at the end of the second Fro. 58.— Burdock, 
season. The important thing is to prevent its seeding, 
and thus keep it from spreading. During the first year 
of growth, the plant is easily destroyed by being pulled 
up by the roots when the ground is very wet. Repeated 
cutting a short distance below the surface of the ground 
may be required the second season. But, whatever 
method be adopted, the plant should never be permitted 
to bloom.

to condemn this beautiful plant as a harmful weed, but 
such is the case. Where it is allowed to grow, it often 
fills pastures and meadow lands to so great an extent as 
to crowd out more useful plants, and thus becomes a 
source of damage. 
The ox-eye daisy has sometimes been cultivated in the 
flower garden. It is a near relative to the garden chrys- 
anthemum. It is sel- 
dom troublesome, ex- 
cept in meadows or 
pasture lands, and 
grows best in rather 
poor soils. It is a 
perennial: plant, and 
grows from an un-

eggs, Ransted), Linaria vulgaris— The snap dragon or 
toadflax was brought to this country as a garden flower, 
but it is becoming quite dangerous. It is perennial, and 
is spread both by its seeds and its creeping rootstocks. 
It tends to form a large patch, and, so far as it extends, 
forces out all other plants.

top of the stem. The pistillate flowers are in clus- 
ters of two or three at the base of the male stalk. 
These enlarge and 
form thick, hard, ob- 
long burs, beset with 
stiff hooked prickles, 
and bearing two strong 
beaks at the upper end. 
These burs, like those 
of the burdock, stick to 
clothing and to the 
coats of animals. The 
upper portion of a plant 
‘ of cocklebur is shown 
Fic. 61.—Cocklebur. 8 in Figure 61. At the 
top of the stem, the heads of staminate flowers are seen, 
and, at the base of the leaves, heads of the pistillate flow- 
ers. At the right, near the top of the figure, is a staminate 
flower enlarged. A shows a bur, and B, a section of the 
same, showing the two embryos. Both A and B are 
about natural size. Each bur, when ripe, incloses two 
seeds, one of which may germinate the first year, and the 
other lie dormant until a later time. 
It has been said that the plant is poisonous to cattle, 
but this is probably a mistake. 
The cocklebur is common in barnyards, along roadsides, 
in waste places, and cultivated grounds, 
As the root of the cocklebur is not creeping, and does 
not live in the ground through winter, clean culture with 
some hoed crop, or seeding to clover or meadow grass, 
with frequent mowing, will keep it under control. It

should be carefully prevented from seeding, not only in 
cultivated grounds, but in waste places as well, and this 
is the only means by “which it may be prevented from 
becoming troublesome. It is often necessary to go 
through corn and stubble fields in August or September 
for this purpose. 
The Sow Thistle (called, also: Field sow thistle, Per- 
ennial sow thistle), Sonchus arvensis.— This plant is al- 
most as bad as the 
Canada thistle. 
Indeed, some 
farmers who have 
contended with 
both of these ene- 
mies have pro- 
nounced the sow 
thistle the more 
unmanageable of 
‘the two. 
The plant of the 
sow thistle is soft-

than that of either 
the Canada thistle 
or the bull thistle. 
The leaves are 
thinner and

while having

the Canada thistle, grows from underground buds, as 
well as by seed. In Figure 62, is shown a specimen of 
the perennial sow thistle. Young plants of the sow

Sour Dock (called, also: Yellow dock, Curled dock,

valuable for use in medicine and its young leaves make 
excellent greens; but the ground it occupies is far prefer- 
able to its company, and it should be persistently hunted

is to root it out by hand at times when the soil is very

Wild Mustard (called, also: Charlock, English char-

mustard is a coarse, 
rough, annual’ plant, 
much like the garden 
radish, except that it 
has a more irregular 
and branching root. 
The stem and branches 
end in clusters of yel- 
low flowers, of which 
the lower ones are first 
to open. The stem con- 
tinues to lengthen, 
forming a long, leafless 
flower stalk, with

The best way to get rid of the wild mustard is to go 
through grain fields and other places where it grows, and 
pull out the plants while they are in bloom, and hence 
easily seen. Not one should be permitted to remain.

The Wild Parsnip, Pastinaca sativa.— The wild pars- 
nip is the wild form of the common garden parsnip, and is 
hence readily known. The illustra- 
tion, Figure 66, is froma plant taken J 
from a meadow, and of which the 
root leaves had perished. 
The plant is biennial, forming its 
root leaves the first season and its 
flower stalk the second. Perhaps the 
best method of destroying the young 
plants is by pulling them out at a time 
when the soil is filled with water and 
the roots may be drawn out nearly 
entire. Cutting off the young plants 
with the hoe tends rather to increase 
than to kill them. Cutting the flower 
stalks of the second year plants be- 
fore the seeds are old enough to 
become ripe will prevent spreading 
by the seeds, and, as the parent plant 
has run its course, it will soon perish. 
The Russian Thistle (called, also: 
Russian cactus, Saltwort, Tartar

from six inches to three feet, branching profusely, and, 
when not crowded, often forms a dense, brushlike plant 
from two to six feet in width, and from one half to two 
thirds as high. When young, it is a very harmless look- 
ing plant, tender and juicy throughout, with small, nar-

in August, the tender, downy leaves wither and fall, 
and the plant increases rapidly in size, sending out hard,

stiff branches. Instead of leaves, these branches bear 
at intervals of half an inch or less, three sharp spines, 
which harden, but do not grow dull, as the plant increases 
in size and ugliness. The spines are from a quarter to 
a half inch in length. At the base of each cluster of 
spines, is a papery flower about one eighth of an inch in 
width. If this be taken out and carefully pulled to pieces, 
a small, pulpy, green body, coiled up and appearing like a 
tiny green snail shell, will be found. This is the seed. 
As the seed ripens, it becomes hard and of a rather dull- 
gray color. At the earliest frost, the plants change in
-P-A-G-E-129

color from dark green to crimson, especially on the most 
exposed parts. When the ground becomes frozen and the 
November winds blow across the prairie, the small root is 
broken or loosened and pulled out. The dense, yet light, 
growth, and the circu- 
lar or hemispherical 
form of the plant, fit it 
most perfectly to be 
carried by the wind. It 
goes rolling across the 
country at racing speed, 
scattering seeds at ev-

The best method of 
destroying Russian 
thistles is by plowing in 
August or September,

large and stiff, and be- 
fore they have gone to

seeds are well turned

distinct plant. A large amount of nourishment is stored 
up in the underground stems, which makes them very 
nutritive and furnishes food for growth. The new plants. 
formed by cutting up the old ones grow with great vigor, 
and so form many weeds in the place of one. The under- 
ground portions are eaten by stock when they can get at 
them. Horses and cows are fond of them; hogs root 
industriously for them and help to destroy them. 
The illustration of quack grass shown in Figure 70 
makes further description unnecessary. 
The summer fallow is probably the most satisfactory 
method of destroying quack grass on any large scale. 
Turn the sod under in spring and plow again as often as 
any amount of grass appears above ground, until Septem- 
ber, when rye or wheat may be sown if desired. It is 
best to remove fences or other obstructions to the plow, 
that make a harboring place for the underground 
stems, 
Small patches may be destroyed by covering the ground 
deeply with straw or other litter, or by devoting the 
ground to some crop that requires clean culture, as cab- 
bage, cauliflower or celery, provided the required clean 
culture be faithfully given. Patches of quack grass 
should never be cross plowed or cross cultivated in tilling 
the field that contains them, as this is one of the surest 
means of spreading the underground stems to new loca- 
tions.

as often as the flower- 
stalks appear will de- 
stroy them, and will 
also prevent their seed- 
ing. The first mow- 
ing often seems to in- 
crease the number of 
plants, but, as the root 
is biennial, it can not 
live long. Pulling the

are about an inch long and open mostly in the morning, 
like those of the morning glory, with which this plant 
is often confused. The 
plant is a rapid grower 
and spreads chiefly by 
means of its fleshy un-

The bindweed is a most troublesome weed where it once 
gets a start. It does not spread rapidly when left to 
itself, but it is extremely difficult to destroy, and small 
patches of it in cultivated ground are liable to be widely 
scattered by the cultivating tools. Perhaps the best treat-

Repeatedly mowing the plants as they come into bloom, 
or earlier, will subdue them. Thorough cultivation with 
a hoed crop, by means of which the seed in the soil may 
be made to germinate, will be found very successful. The 
first plowing should be shallow, so as not to bury the seeds 
too deep. The mature seed-bearing plants should never 
be plowed under, as that would plant the seeds at differ- 
ent depths. Mature plants should be mowed and burned 
before plowing. The seed appears in clover, millet, and 
the heavier grass seeds, and the plant is very often started 
by this means. As the seed may be carried a long dis-

THE STRAWBERRY (PI. I.). 
The Strawberry is a good fruit for boys and girls to 
cultivate. The plants are easily taken care of, and may 
bear a full crop of fruit the next season after planting. 
  Fic. 76.— Strawberry blossoms, 
The plants multiply during summer from trailing run- 
ners. One plant set out in spring will often form thirty 
or forty young plants by autumn. These will nearly all 
bear fruit the following summer. 
There are many varieties of strawberries, and not all 
succeed equally well in every garden. Before deciding 
what variety to plant, inquiry should be made of neigh- 
bors to find what variety succeeds best in the vicinity. 
Perfect and Imperfect Flowers.— There isa lesson to 
be learned about the flowers of the strawberry. The
-P-A-G-E-140
    132 THE GARDEN 
flowers of some varieties are not perfect, and will not bear 
fruit unless a variety having perfect flowers is planted 
in the same plat with them. Figure 76, 6, shows an 
imperfect strawberry flower, and Figure 76, a, a perfect 
one. Figure 76, c, has a few stamens, but is not well 
supplied. The little organs marked S (Fig. 53, A) are 
the stamens, which give out the pollen. Some of this 
pollen must come upon the pistils, P, or a fruit will not 
be produced. (Lessons 22 and 23.) If plants of a per- 
fect-flowered variety are growing within five or six feet of 
those of an imperfect-flowered sort, the bees will carry 
the pollen to the latter plants, and they will bear fruit as 
well as if they had pollen of their own. Some of the 
most beautiful varieties of strawberries have imperfect 
flowers. 
Care and Planting.— The best strawberries commonly 
grow on plants that were formed the season before, hence 
only these should be set. The plants are generally set 
out in the spring, about two feet apart, in rows three 
and one-half or four feet apart. A plat of plants cov- 
ering five or six square rods should furnish strawberries 
enough for an average family. The soil should be fer- 
tile and free from perennial weeds. By autumn, the 
plants should have multiplied to such an extent that each 
row forms a bed of plants about two feet wide. Of 
course, all weeds should be kept out of this bed. The 
cultivator should be freely used between the rows to 
keep the soil well crumbled and to keep the plants in the 
different rows apart. In climates where the ground 
freezes much in winter, it is best to cover the strawberry 
bed an inch deep with clean straw or leaves just before
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE GARDEN 133 
freezing weather. This keeps the ground from freezing 
and thawing often during the winter, and so tends to 
protect the roots from damage. In spring, the covering 
should be raked off and the ground between the rows 
well cultivated. Just before the fruit ripens, the ground 
between the rows should be mulched with straw or grass, 
to keep the fruit from being spattered with dirt by the 
rain. 
After the strawberry harvest is past, if the bed is to 
be kept for another crop, it is well to mow off the plants 
close to the ground with a scythe or mowing machine. 
The cut-off material may then be dried in the sun, and, 
with the mulching that remains between the rows, raked 
from the bed and burned. This will destroy some harm- 
ful insects and diseases. The wide rows may then be 
narrowed down to about six inches in width. This may 
be done by cutting all the plants off just beneath the sur- 
face of the ground with a sharp spade, except in a strip 
six inches wide through the center of the row. The 
ground between the rows should then be enriched by 
spreading decayed manure over it, and should be well 
cultivated. If the weather be dry, the plat should, if 
possible, be well watered. New plants will then be 
formed on both sides of this narrow row, and, by fall, 
the rows will be as wide as they were in the spring, and 
most of the plants will be young. 
Some gardeners plow up the strawberry bed after the 
first crop of berries has been picked. Others treat it as 
above directed, and pick a second crop the following year.

manured each year, the third crop may be as large as the 
first. 
THE RASPBERRY AND BLACKBERRY. 
Planting and Care.— The raspberry and blackberry 
are delicious fruits. The bushes generally bear prickles, 
and the stems die down to the 
base each year after fruiting. 
They are hardy except where 
winters are very cold. They 
multiply by suckers that grow 
from the roots, or by the ends 
of the branches taking root in 
the ground. The young plants 
are usually set about four feet 
apart in rows seven or eight 
Fic. 77— Eldorado blackberry. feet apart. They begin to 
bear fruit the second year after planting. The ground 
between the plants should be cultivated or mulched. The 
dead stems that have borne fruit should be cut off and 
taken out in the fall or early spring, and the young 
shoots that grow from the base in spring will need thin- 
ning out after the second year. Only four or five for 
each plant should be allowed to grow. Where winters 
are very cold, the stems should be bent down and coy- 
ered with earth late in autumn. To avoid breaking the 
stems, a little earth is removed from near their base, so 
that the strain of bending comes mostly on the roots. 
The raspberry and blackberry are not much troubled 
by insects. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE GARDEN 135 
Marketing.— The strawberry, raspberry and_black- 
berry are largely grown for market in some localities. 
They generally prove profitable where the business is well 
managed. To be most successful, they should be grown 
in a location where labor and manure may be had 
cheap, and where they may be sent to market without 
having to be carried far by wagon. They are commonly 
sold in quart or pint boxes, which are packed in cases or 
crates. The picked berries should be removed promptly 
to a cool, shady place, and should always be handled with 
care to avoid bruising them. The yield of berries per 
acre is usually larger than that of grain. 
The raspberry, in some places, is dried in large quan- 
tities, and the dried fruit brings a good price in market. 
THE CURRANT AND GOOSEBERRY (Pl. 1). 
Planting and Care.— The currant and gooseberry are 
less popular fruits than the strawberry, but they are 
easily grown, and at least a few bushes should be found 
in every garden. The bushes may be planted from four 
to six feet apart each way. They are very hardy and 
fruitful. They are multiplied by planting cuttings of the 
stem in moist soil, or by covering the stems with earth. 
As the bushes become old, the oldest stems may be cut 
off. 
A troublesome insect, called the currant worm, gener- 
ally appears on the leaves rather early in spring. If this 
is not destroyed, it will consume most of the leaves and 
the fruit will not grow well. It appears first on the lower 
and more central leaves of the bushes. To destroy the 
currant worm, sprinkle the leaves with water that has
-P-A-G-E-144

powder of white hellebore stirred in it. This powder 
may be bought at drug stores. A tablespoonful should 
be well stirred into about three gallons of water. The 
mixture may be put on the bushes with a sprinkling pot. 
Currants are mostly used for making jelly, for which 
they are much prized. There are red, white and black 
varieties. Gooseberries are used when green for sauce 
and for canning. Only the native American varieties 
are satisfactory in the United States.
-P-A-G-E-145
  27. THE ORCHARD. 
Every farmer should have an orchard. Fruit trees of 
some kinds will grow wherever farm crops will grow. 
Good fruit not only is pleasing to the taste, but is very 
healthful as food. 
Orchard trees are grown by planting the seeds or the 
pits of fruit. They need to be grafted or budded to 
make them bear fruit of a particular variety. 
Planting.— Fruit trees rarely grow and bear fruit well 
unless they receive good care. They. should be planted 
far enough apart so that the tops will not shade: each 
other, and so that the roots will have sufficient room to 
procure the water they need. They should be pruned 
sufficiently so that the branches will not rub against each 
other much, and so that the sun can shine in upon the 
growing fruit. The ground should be manured to such an 
extent that the trees may have all the fertility they need for 
continuous fruit bearing. The soil should be cultivated 
during the first half of the season while the trees are 
growing. About midsummer, it is well to sow some 
quick-growing crop, as oats, peas, clover, or vetches, to 
furnish a cover for the ground during winter. This 
tends to prevent washing, deep freezing and thawing of 
the ground, and to save fertility. 
Insect Pests.— Orchard trees need more or less pro- 
tection against harmful insects and fungi. There are 
137
-P-A-G-E-146
138 THE ORCHARD 
various ways of giving this protection, and some special 
knowledge is needed for each kind of fruit. Much of 
  Fic. 78—The Filat- 
headed borer; a, the Jarva; b, the pupa; d, the perfect beetle. this protection is given by spray- 
img the trees. This means spraying 
them with water containing some 
substance that destroys the harmful 
insects or fungi without injuring 
the fruit. This is done with a force 
pump and hose. The hose is fitted 
with a nozzle that divides the stream 
into very fine spray. 
Other means of protection are 
necessary in some cases. Borers 
often injure the trunks of trees. 
These must be destroyed or kept 
out by special treatments. Insects are sometimes en- 
trapped by placing bands about the trunks of the trees. 
Fruits containing insects 
are often destroyed or 
are fed to stock, to keep 
the insects from multi- 
plying. 
The successful fruit 
grower will need to 
study much, and to 
watch carefully to guard 
against insects and dis- 
ease. 
  THE APPLE. Fic. 79.— A wormy apple, showing the fa~ miliar mass of brown particles thrown out 
at the blossom-end by the young worm. 
The Apple is the most important American fruit. It 
may be had in its fresh state the whole year through.

  THE ORCHARD 139 
  Fic. 80.— Section of wormy apple; a, codling moth; b, cocoon. 
The tree is one of the largest and longest-lived of fruit 
trees. It begins bearing when from three to eight years 
of age, and sometimes lives nearly or 
quite a century. It is grown with 
more or less success throughout the 
United States and Southern Canada. 
The trees are commonly planted 
when about three years old, and 
should not be set less than twenty- 
five feet apart both ways. They 
should be pruned somewhat each 
year to prevent the branches from 
growing too thickly. 
The Codling Moth.— The apple 
is much injured by an insect called 
the “codling moth,” of which the 
maggot form lives in the fruit, caus- 
  Fic. 81.— Hairy wood- pecker,
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 THE ORCHARD 
ing “ wormy apples.” It is estimated that this worm has 
caused over $7,000,000 damage each year in the states of 
Nebraska, Illinois and New York alone. The codling 
moth can be controlled pretty well by spraying the trees 
soon after the flowering period with water containing 
Paris green stirred in it, at the rate of one pound to two 
hundred gallons. 
The woodpecker finds the worm hidden in his silken 
cocoon under the scales of the bark of the apple tree. 
This bird should not be killed. He is doing a good work 
in destroying the worms that would otherwise spoil many 
apples. 
THE PLUM AND CHERRY. 
The Plum and Cherry are favorite fruits which can be 
grown over much of the United States and parts of 
Canada. They grow on small trees that begin to bear 
when they are three or four years old. The trees 
are planted in the orchard 
when they are about two 
years old, and are set about 
sixteen feet apart each 
way. 
The Curculio.— An insect 
called the curculio troubles 
the fruit by laying an egg in 
it. The egg hatches into a

-P-A-G-E-149
  
THE ORCHARD I4I 
curculio may be caught by jarring it off the trees early 
in the morning on a sheet spread on the ground. The 
insect is then stiff from the cold and so does not fly. 
THE PEACH. 
The Peach is one of the most delicious of all fruits. 
It grows on a tree about as large as a plum tree. The 
peach tree begins to bear fruit when three or four years 
of age. The peach is not so hardy as the plum or cherry, 
and it succeeds well only in certain parts of the country; 
but a few trees may be planted in the orchard wherever — 
the winter is not too cold for it, and they will often bear 
fruit enough for the family. The fruit of the peach is 
mostly borne on the shoots that grew the season before, 
hence it should be pruned to make plenty of young wood. 
Yellows.— The peach is subject to a disease called 
“yellows,” that has entirely destroyed many whole or- 
chards of this tree. No remedy is known for it but to 
dig out and burn the affected trees. 
THE GRAPE. 
The Grape is a fine fruit, that is successfully grown 
over nearly all of the United States. Every home should 
have at least a few grape vines. They require little 
room, as they can be trained upon a fence or the wall of 
a building, if need be. Their fruit, which ripens in au- 
tumn, is wholesome and delicious. A plat of ground 
planted with grapes is called a vineyard. Vines in the 
vineyard are planted from seven to ten feet apart both 
ways. Grape vines bear fruit when three or four years  
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 THE ORCHARD 
old. The grape is commonly multiplied from cuttings of 
the stem. 
Pruning and Cultivating.— The grape vine is a rapid 
grower, and therefore needs to be severely pruned to 
keep it within bounds. The best fruit is borne on the 
shoots that grow from.the part of the vine that grew 
the year before. In pruning the vine, we should leave 
on some of the wood that grew the last season, but should 
cut off most of the older wood. The grape vine is com- 
monly tied to a trellis made of wire or slats. Some- 
times it is permitted to climb over an arbor or summer 
house without much pruning, but it is only with careful 
pruning that the best grapes can be grown. 
The ground between the rows of grapes should be 
well cultivated during the summer to keep down weeds. 
In countries having cold winters, grape vines should 
be protected in winter as described in the section on the 
raspberry and blackberry in lesson 26.

28. ANIMALS THAT DESTROY INSECTS. 
Natural Destroyers.— We might greatly reduce the 
number of insects and worms that destroy our crops, by 
taking care not to destroy the animals that feed upon 
them. We have been so 
careless in destroying in- 
sects, toads, and birds that 
live upon the insects 
which do us harm, that 
these insects have greatly 
increased in number and 
have become pests. If all 
would study to preserve 
the friends and to destroy 
the enemies of our crops, 
we should be rid of the de- 
structive insects in a short 
time.

1 There is a popular notion that all small animals, such as flies, spiders, and 
the coral animals in the sea, are. insects. This is a mistake, as neither the 
spiders nor the coral polyps belong to the insect class. The word insect is 
applied properly to those animals which have bodies divided into three distinct 
sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. From the head there springs 
a pair of feelers called antenne, and from the thorax six legs grow. The 
wasp is a good illustration of an insect. The spider has but two distinct parts, 
and comes under another class.

larvee of an insect that has bored deeply into the trunk of

2 All insects begin life as a tiny egg. This may be laid under the bark of a 
tree, in the fruit, on the water, or in the dirt. After a time the egg begins to 
hatch. It usually produces a little worm-like creature, called a larva. This is 
sometimes called the grub or the caterpillar stage. The larva may have 
numerous feet and two strong jaws. It is very hungry, eats a great deal and 
grows rapidly. After a few days, it is fully grown, and may change into the

Lady Bugs are small beetles, with bright-colored, scaly 
wings. They feed on plant lice scales and the eggs. and 
larvee of other insects. They 
are among the most valuable 
of insect destroyers, and 
should be welcomed in the 
house and in the garden. 
Dragon flies are beautiful 
insects with gauzy wings. 
They may be seen about 
ponds and streams in the 
summer time. They are the

quitoes, the gnats, and the flies. They dart through the 
pupa. In this state, it eats nothing. If it is a butterfly or moth, it wraps 
itself in a silken covering or wraps a leaf about itself, and may stay in this 
condition for some months. At last, however, it breaks through its cover- 
ing and becomes a fully developed insect. This, its last state before death, ‘is 
called the imago state. The life history of each kind of insect varies some- 
what, but almost all insects pass through the forms egg, larva, pupa, and imago.

air, and catch many small insects on the wing. When 
they alight, they still keep their wings outspread. ‘They 
lay their eggs on the stems of water 
plants or on the water. 
Damsel Flies are much like the 
dragon flies, but are smaller and fold 
their wings over the back when they 
are at rest. 
Toads.— These homely looking an- 
imals are very useful in ridding us 
of harmful insects. If we knew all 
the good that they do by feeding on 
insects, we should not think them so 
ugly, and we certainly should never 
stone them or kill them. Insects de- 
stroy every year over $300,000,000 
worth of our crops. A large part of 
this might be saved if we should pro- 
tect the toads and increase their num- 
Fic. 88—Adamselfy. ber, There is a popular idea that 
toads will make warts if they are handled. This is an 
error. The toad is perfectly harmless. 
Bring a pair of toads into the house, and watch the 
good, work that they do. A room may be cleared of 
cockroaches by leaving a toad in it over night. 
Get acquainted with the habits of the toads. You will 
find their study very interesting. Have you seen the large 
masses of bead-like eggs that the female toad lays? 
Have you seen the tadpoles that have been hatched from 
the eggs? Have you watched their growth from tad- 
poles to toads? 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  ANIMALS THAT DESTROY INSECTS 147 
If you wish to raise a colony of toads, place a pair on 
a stone partly out of the water in a partly filled pail or 
jar. After the eggs are 
laid, watch them as 
they hatch into tad- 
poles. The tadpoles 
should be fed with bits 
of meat or bread, until 
they change into toads. 
Keep the garden well 
stocked with toads, and 
very little damage from 
insects need be feared, 
Birds.— The largest number of the birds that fly about 
our homes are insect destroyers. Besides delighting the 
eye with their beauty and filling the world full of song, 
they are saving the farmers millions of dollars each year. 
How foolish it is to shoot these valuable birds or to rob 
their nests! 
The birds living on insects have greatly decreased in 
number in the past few years, and the insects have in- 
creased so greatly that the farmer and the gardener have 
been put to extra labor’to preserve their crops. 
The birds living largely on insects, worms, etc., are 
swallows, martins, vireos, woodpeckers, chickadees, wrens, 
cuckoos, swifts, and fly-catchers. 
The robin and the blue bird live on about equal quan- 
tities of insects and fruit. Because they come so early 
in the spring and destroy so many of the insects before 
they have laid their eggs for the season, these birds are 
of great value.

  Every means should be taken to attract the above men-

trees that bear berries in the fall, so that the birds may

    150 ANIMALS THAT DESTROY INSECTS 
The English sparrow is not a desirable bird for the 
United States. It not only eats much grain and vegetable 
matter, but has driven out a number of birds that are 
valuable as insect destroyers. We should take means to 
rid ourselves of this troublesome little fellow.* 
Just after a bird has hatched, its stomach is very deli- 
cate, and it can digest animal food only. For that rea- 
son, all nestlings are fed on worms and insects. Even 
the birds that live mostly on grain and fruit when they 
1The English sparrow is doing more damage to property than all the other 
birds in our latitude put together, and, as an agent of destruction to our native 
birds, the sparrow is unexcelled. No other bird will stay long where sparrows 
are once located. It means persecution in detail by individual sparrows and 
by mobs of them till all self-respecting birds are compelled to leave the locality. 
The English sparrow is the only bird that carries on a systematic attack upon 
the homes of its neighbors. It has been seen by many observers in different 
localities to visit the nests of its neighbors in the absence of the parent birds 
and to throw the young nestlings out upon the ground, in some cases dropping 
them ten to fifteen feet to the foot of the tree. The sparrows are with us 
all the year round, and, unlike most of our native birds, their food is almost 
entirely grain. They are, then, no substitute for the insectivorous birds that 
they expel, and they are a filthy nuisance about the barns and granaries as 
well as the dwellings where they congregate. They are a greater pest than 
rats and mice, and they are more difficult to combat. The most. effective 
method of dealing with the sparrow is by poison. During the winter months, 
if a platform be built above the reach of the poultry, and the sparrows be fed 
there regularly in order to accustom them to the place, they may be easily 
poisoned. The recipe I quote from an article by E. B, Clark, in The Outing 
of January, 1901: “ Mix a drachm of strychnine with three quarts of boiling 
water. Let the mixture boil until the poison is entirely dissolved. Into the 
poisoned water pour a sufficient quantity of wheat to absorb the liquid. Put 
the mixture aside for forty-eight hours. The wheat will be found to have 
swollen greatly. Spread it over the bottom of a large pan and place it in an 
oven until thoroughly dry. It must not, however, be allowed to scorch in 
the least. English sparrows consider wheat prepared in this way as a great 
tidbit. It gives to them a swift and painless death.” This method reaches 
a hundred of the sparrows to ten that can be reached during any other part 
of the year, and farmers ought to bestir themselves, or the useful native birds 
will be exterminated or driven away by these sparrow pests. We must deal 
with the sparrows as we deal with rats and mice, and no false sentiment ought 
to be allowed to enter into the matter.—Pror. O. G. Liznsy,

ANIMALS THAT DESTROY INSECTS I51 
are full grown, are very valuable in destroying insects, 
grubs, etc., when they are feeding their young." 
Examination of the stomachs of different birds (see 
page 149) shows what birds are of the greatest value to 
the farmer. 
1 During the outbreak of Rocky Mountain locusts in Nebraska in 1874-1877, 
Prof. Samuel Aughey saw a long-billed marsh wren carry thirty locusts to 
her young in an hour, At this rate, for seven hours a day, a brood would 
consume 210 locusts per day, and the passerine birds of the eastern half. of 
Nebraska, allowing only twenty broods to the square mile, would destroy daily 
162,771,000 of the pests. The average locust weighs about fifteen grains, and 
is capable each day of consuming its own weight of standing forage crops, 
which at $10.00 per ton would be worth $1,743.97. This case may serve as 
an illustration of the vast good that is done every year by the destruction 
of insect pests fed to nestling birds. And it should be remembered that the 
nesting season is also that when the destruction of injurious insects is most 
needed, that is, at the period of greatest agricultural activity and before the 
parasitic insects can be depended on to reduce the pests. The encouragement 
of birds to nest on the farm and the discouragement of nest robbing are 
therefore more than mere matters of sentiment; they return in actual cash 
equivalent, and have a definite bearing on the success or failure of the crops.—

29. ANIMAL HUSBANDRY. 
Importance of the Subject.— There is a large market 
for meats, butter, eggs, lard, etc. The demand for wool, 
leather, furs, feathers, glue, horns, etc., is also large. 
Wild animals can not supply these wants entirely. Ani- 
mals must, therefore, be raised on the farm. The pro- 
duction of animals and of animal products, such as milk, 
butter, eggs and wool, is a very important branch of 
farming. 
What Must be Learned.— Animal husbandry requires 
a different kind of knowledge from that required for 
grain, fruit or vegetable growing. Animals require more 
attention than field crops. Their food, drink, light, and 
the air that they breathe, all need to be looked after. The 
care of their young demands careful attention. To learn 
to feed animals in the way that is best for their develop- 
ment and also least expensive to the farmer, requires 
constant study. 
Economy in Raising Animals— As we have learned 
in previous lessons, the selling of crops from the land 
removes the richest part of the land. Unless this is re- 
turned to the soil in some form, the soil will become 
“poor,” and it will be impossible to produce good crops. 
When animals are grown on the farm, however, the farm 
products grown from the soil are fed to the animals, and 
are largely returned to the soil in the form of manure. 
The animal products that are sold, as meat, butter, eggs, 
152 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
ANIMAL HUSBANDRY 153 
etc., take away little fertility from the farm, and bring 
to it a comparatively large amount of money. 
Breeds of Live Stock.— As there are many races of 
men, each having some peculiarities that distinguish it 
from the others, so there are great families in-the animal 
world. These large families having distinguishing 
qualities that are transmitted from parent to offspring, 
are called breeds. 
The different breeds of farm animals have been pro- 
duced largely by careful selection and the mating of such 
animals as have certain traits or peculiarities that man 
desires to hold. 
NEAT CATTLE. 
The various breeds of cattle are probably descended 
from the same stock. Although there are about one hun- 
dred different breeds known in the world, there are but 
a few that are important for us to know. They may be 
divided into two great classes, depending on their pur- 
pose: dairy breeds and beef breeds. The dairy breeds 
have for their chief purpose the production of milk, butter 
and cheese. The beef breeds have for their chief pur- 
pose the production of flesh or beef.

“Pretty is as pretty does,” be ac- 
cepted. Her form presents the 
appearance of a double wedge. Inferior wedge of dairy cow. 
Jersey Cattle— These cattle 
originated on the island of Jer- 
sey in the English Channel. Superior wedge of beef cow.

forms. The Jersey cow is a great butter producer. The 
milk is very rich in butter fat, and the cream rises more 
rapidly and perfectly than that of most breeds. The 
average Jersey cows will produce 400 pounds of butter 
per year, and the best have produced as high as 1,000 
pounds in that time. 
Guernsey Cattle— This breed was produced on the 
island of Guernsey, not far from the home of the Jerseys. 
Guernsey cattle are somewhat larger and coarser than the 
Jerseys, but they resemble them in their ability to produce 
butter. They give a somewhat larger supply of milk, 
and it is fully as rich as that of the Jerseys. These are 
very gentle cattle, and are very popular with dairymen. 
Ayrshire Cattle—— These cattle are natives of the county 
of Ayr in the southwestern part of Scotland. They are 
good butter producers, but are classed chiefly as cheese 
cows. The quality of their milk is good and the quan- 
tity is large. The milk is easily digested even by infants, 
and is the best for family trade. The Ayrshires are 
hardy and active. They are able to gather food from 
scanty pastures better than other breeds. Their short, 
upward-turned horns, the large patches of red or brown 
and white, and the fine dairy form, make them a very at- 
tractive breed. 
Holstein Friesian Cattle— These cattle are sometimes 
called the Dutch or the Holland cattle. The breed had 
its origin in Holland, and is the oldest distinct breed in 
existence. It produces a larger quantity of milk than 
any other breed. The quality of the milk has not been so 
good as that of the other dairy breeds, but it has been 
much improved during the past few years.

The breed is of value also for beef. The frame is large, 
and the color is black and white." 
The Brown Swiss Cattle originated in Switzerland. 
They have short heavy legs, and in size and color resem- 
ble the Jerseys. They are large milk producers, and fur- 
nish some good beef. 
1The Dutch Belted Cattle are much like the Holstein-Friesian, from which 
they are derived. They are colored black and white, the white being in the 
shape of a blanket or belt around the body.

81. BEEF BREEDS (PI. VIL. VIII). 
The Beef Type.— The body of the beef animal is well- 
rounded and compact. This arises from its tendency to 
lay on flesh. In gen- 
eral, it presents the ap- 
pearance of a brick set 
on edge. The back is 
broad, both in front 
and behind. The ud- 
der is much smaller 
than in the dairy breeds. The short stout legs are set 
squarely at each corner of the body. 
Shorthorn Cattle. This is the most important breed 
of cattle, and outnumbers any other breed. Its origin is 
in Durham County, England, and for this reason it was 
formerly called “ Durham.” 
Some Shorthorn cows produce a good quantity of rich 
milk. Some herds are valuable as butter makers, and 
others for cheese production; but, as a breed, the Short- 
horn belongs in the beef class, although some individuals 
have made great dairy records. 
The Shorthorn is of a quiet disposition and is easily 
kept, eating coarse fodders, as well as softer foods. 
The Polled Durham breed originated in America. It 
is very much like the Shorthorn, from which it was de- 
rived, except that it is hornless. 
The Hereford Cattle— The Herefords originated in 
Hereford County, in England. They are distinctly a

-P-A-G-E-166
  158 BEEF BREEDS 
beef breed, the milk being of little account. The beef is 
good and is somewhat mixed with fat. 
These animals are hardy and adapted to cold climates. 
The face, breast, belly, and the lower part of the legs, are 
white. 
The Aberdeen Angus Cattle— These are sometimes 
called the Polled Angus. They are black like the Gallo- 
way breed, but differ from it chiefly in being somewhat 
larger and finer in bone, head and hair. The hair is 
smooth. They are better adapted for indoor feeding. 
The Galloway Cattle— The Galloway cattle originated 
in Scotland. They area polled, or hornless, breed. They 
have thick coats of black hair, and are especially adapted 
to exposure and extremes of heat and cold, They are 
very valuable for the western part of the United States, 
where they seek their own food on the plains. Their 
coats, when tanned, make good robes. 
Devon Cattle.— Devon cattle take their name from the 
county of Devon, England. They area very old breed, and 
were noted at first for their fine dairy qualities, but of late 
have been valued chiefly for their fine quality of beef. 
Red Polled Cattle are very much like the Devon. They 
are becoming popular in this country. 
The Simmenthal Cattle are of Swiss origin, and are 
valuable for dairy purposes, for beef,.and for work. 
The Native (Scrub) Cattle— These are not a pure 
breed, but a mixture of breeds. There are a large num- 
ber of these cattle in the United States. Although many 
Natives are valuable for one purpose or another, the re- 
sults are very uncertain. A herd of Native cattle may be 
greatly improved by placing at its head a bull of the type 
toward which it is desired to breed.

Creameries and Cheese Factories.— Butter and cheese i 
were formerly made entirely on the farm. They are now 
made chiefly in fac- 
tories, where the 
milk may be had in 
large quantities. In 
this manner, the ex- 
pense of manufac- 
ture is greatly re- 
duced. A more uni- 
form quality can 
also be secured, and 
better opportunities 
for selling the prod- 
ucts are found. Some 
dairymen prefer to 
make their butter at 
home. With proper 
skill and care, excel- 
lent results are se- 
cured. The highest 
prices are generally 
received by dairy- 
men who make their Fic. 93.— Old fashioned churn,

Butter factories are called “ creameries.” Butter made 
at a creamery is known in the market as “‘ creamery but- 
ter.” That made on the farm is known as “ dairy 
butter.” 
The successful manufacturer of butter and cheese must 
have more or less special education and training. These 
can best be acquired in a dairy school. 
MILK. 
The Composition of Milk. —Milk is the most important 
product of the cow on the dairy farm. It is produced in 
the glands of the cow’s 
udder. Milk is com- 
posed largely of water, 
in which fat globules 
are floating, and in 
which casein, albumen, 
sugar, and mineral 
matter or ash are dis- 
solved. Although the 
amounts of these sub- 
stances vary greatly, 
5  sueansiey a | the average propor- 
: a2 Te tions are Salticated in 
ie ee ee he ee ee 61.) (Figure 96). 
Milk is heavier than water. Although the fat in milk 
is lighter than water and for that reason has a tendency 
to rise, the other substances in it make the milk heavier. 
The Fat.— The fat in the milk is the most important 
element in the production of butter. It is floating in the   
 
-P-A-G-E-169
DAIRYING 161 
milk and a part of it rises to the top to form cream. Some 
of the fat globules do not rise to the top. They are held 
down by the albumen and sugar in the milk. 
The fat globules vary in size. Milk from the Jerseys 
and Guernseys has larger globules, than that from the 
Ayrshires and the Holsteins. Large globules are an advan- 
tage in butter making, as they rise more easily than the 
small ones. Small globules are an advantage in cheese

making, as they do not rise so quickly, and are held in the 
milk when it curdles. 
_ The fat globules are collected in irregular groups in 
milk. Under the microscope, these groups or families 
may be readily seen. 
The Sugar.— The sugar in milk is not so sweet as or- 
dinary sugar. It is called lactose or “sugar of milk.” 
It is prepared for the market in some factories. It is used 
to make pills and powders for holding medicines.

~ When milk sours, the sugar is changed into lactic acid, 
which gives to milk its sour taste. 
Other Substances in Milk.— Casein is the chief proteid 
in milk. It is of value in cheese making. If rennet or 
a weak acid be added to milk, the casein is changed into a 
curd, from which the cheese is made. 
Albumen or Protein in the milk is much like albumin in 
the blood. It differs from casein in that it coagulates, or 
thickens, when heated. It is the skinlike or paperlike sub- 
stance that appears on the surface of skim milk when it is 
boiled. 
The ash in milk is composed mostly of phosphate of 
lime, but there are many other minerals found in small 
quantities. 
Colostrum.— The first milk that the cow gives after 
the birth of a calf is called colostrum. It contains from 
ten to fifteen times as much albumen as the milk does later, 
and contains less fat and sugar. Colostrum is sometimes 
called “ calves’ milk.” It should not be used for at least 
three days after the birth of the calf. It is safer to wait 
one week before using the milk. 
Yield: Quantity and Quality.— The average cow pro- 
duces about 4,000 pounds of milk per year. Some herds 
will yield an average of 6,000 pounds for each cow. In 
one exceptional case, the yield for a single cow reached 
30,000 pounds. In general, the cow should yield at least 
six times her live weight to be a profitable member of a 
dairy herd. 
The profitableness of a dairy cow depends as much on 
the quality of the milk as it does on the quantity. Milk 
rich in fat and of large quantity should be the aim of all
-P-A-G-E-171
  
DAIRYING 163 
dairymen. It costs no more to raise a cow that yields 
fat sufficient to make 300 pounds of butter than it does to 
raise one producing but 200 pounds. Cows that are not 
profitable are called “boarders.” The worst of it is that 
they never pay for their board. 
It is well to choose a breed that will produce the desired 
quantity and quality of milk, but that will not be enough. 
Even in the best dairy breeds, there are some boarders eat- 
ing up the farmer’s profits. These should be got rid of 
as soon as discovered. 
The Babcock Test.— The only certain way to find out 
which cows in a herd are profitable and which are not, is 
to make frequent tests. 
The milk should be 
weighed, and the amount J 
of butter fat determined / 
by the use of the “ Bab- i/ \

in the Appendix, page 227.

The Importance of Rich Milk in Cheese Making.— 
Even in cheese making, the richness of milk is important. 
The amount of casein in milk increases with the amount of 
fat. Besides this, the fat in the milk makes the cheese 
much richer and better than it would be without it. 
  Fic. 99.— Each cheese was made from 200 pounds of milk. 
A test made in the Dairy School of the University of 
Wisconsin shows that milk rich in fat makes the largest 
and best cheese. Figure 99 shows the result of the test 
plainly. 
HOW TO GET GOOD MILK. 
Health of the Cow.— Good milk can be obtained only 
from healthy cows. If cows have disease of any kind, 
it is liable to affect the milk. 
The most common of the diseases that affect cows is 
tuberculosis or consumption. It has been found that the
-P-A-G-E-173
DAIRYING 165 
tuberculin test will show what cows have the disease. 
Such cows should be disposed of. Although cows may 
be afflicted with tuberculosis without spreading the disease 
among those who use the milk, it is not safe to use it. 
To keep cows in a healthy condition, they should have 
plenty of pure air, good light, and clean stables. The 
stables should be ventilated, and should not be over- 
crowded. Not less than one thousand cubic feet of space 
should be allowed for each cow. 
The stable should be kept just as clean as possible. All 
dirt, dust and manure should be cleaned out regularly. 
Condition of the Cow.— The cow is a sensitive and af- 
fectionate animal. The yield and quality of the milk she 
gives depend much upon her mental condition. She be- 
comes acquainted with her milker. If he treats her kindly 
she enjoys being milked, and yields her largest amount of 
milk of the highest quality; but if she is afraid of her 
milker, and if she is scolded and abused, both the quantity 
and the quality of her milk are reduced. These facts have 
been proved by the most careful experiments. The wise 
dairyman will make his cows comfortable by giving them 
food and drink that they enjoy. He will give them light 
and clean quarters. He will protect them from cold in 
winter, and from insects in summer. He will also treat 
them tenderly, so as to win their affection. 
Condition of Surroundings.— If the cow produces good 
milk, the milk may still be spoiled unless all impurities are 
kept out of it. The milker should have clean clothes and 
clean hands, and should milk into pails that have been 
thoroughly washed. The cow should be curried and 
brushed, so that dirt may not fall into the pail while milk- 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  
166 DAIRYING 
ing is in progress. The udder should be thoroughly 
clean, and the milking should be done with dry hands. 
The milk coming from a healthy cow is pure, but, if it is 
kept in a dirty stable or in a milk room where the air is 
not pure, it soon absorbs the foul odors and becomes 
tainted. 
Bacteria.— There are many bacteria that get into the 
warm milk, and multiply so rapidly that the milk sours. 
To avoid the bacteria, the utmost cleanliness must be ob- 
  bacteria in the milk serum, The cluster of bacteria on left 
acid-forming germs. (H. L. Russell, Wis, Bul. No. 62.) are lactic- Fic. 100,— Microscopic appearance of ordinary milk showing seem Obce and

It will be impossible even then to avoid them altogether, 
but their number will be greatly reduced. Cooling the 
milk as soon as possible after it is drawn prevents the 
bacteria from multiplying, and makes it possible to keep 
the milk sweet.
-P-A-G-E-175
  DAIRYING 167 
Kinds of Bacteria.— There are many bacteria found 
in milk. Some work on the milk sugar, and turn it to 
lactic acid and thus sour the milk. Others attack 
the fat in milk and make butter rancid or strong. Still 
others give to butter its flavor. These are called friendly 
bacteria, and are often put into cream to give the butter 
just the flavor desired. By cleanliness and care in cooling 
the milk, the harmful bacteria may be held in check, so 
that the friendly bacteria may have a chance to grow.

Pasteurization. —It has been found possible to destroy 
all disease germs and the bacteria that are unfriendly in 
milk, by pasteurizing it. In this process, the milk is 
heated to a temperature of about 160° F., and held at that 
point for about fifteen minutes ; then it is cooled as rapidly 
as possible to a temperature of 50° F. This destroys the 
germs but does not otherwise affect the milk. Many 
machines have been invented for doing this work, but it 
may be done in the home without the use of machinery.

The Cream Separator.— The cream separator is a ma-

  It does 
the work much better and 
much more quickly than 
it can be done by allowing 
the cream to rise in pans

The milk is turned into 
a bowl which is rotated 
rapidly. The milk being 
heavier than the cream, 
is thrown by the revoly- 
ing bowl to the outside, 
and passes out through a 
spout, while the cream 
seeks the center and 
passes out through an- 
other spout. The sepa- 
rator collects many im- 
purities from the milk 
that even the best strain- 
ers fail to catch. Sepa- 
rator cream is therefore much purer than other cream.

33. PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING, 
Substances in Bodies of Animals.— The bodies of ani- 
mals contain flesh, fat, bones, teeth, hair, etc.; or, we may 
say that their bodies are composed of water, ash (mineral 
matter), protein and fat. These are the substances that 
must be supplied in the food that the animals eat. The 
body is more than half water, and it is fortunate that ani- 
mals have but little difficulty in getting it. Besides the 
water that they drink, a large part of their food is com- 
posed of water. The ash, or mineral matter, is found in 
all of the foods that animals eat. The largest part of it is 
phosphate of lime. Protein is the name given to the most 
important group of substances to be supplied by the food. 
It forms the principal part of the flesh, skin, brain and 
nerves. It contains nitrogen as its most important ele- 
ment. Fat is found in nearly all parts of the body, and is 
very important in the composition of milk. 
Substances to be Studied.— Little attention need be 
given to supplying water or ash to animals) These may 
be obtained ordinarily in large quantities without cost. 
The protein and the fat-forming foods, however, require 
considerable attention. They are the expensive part of 
the food of an animal, and should be fed with care so that 
there may be no loss. 
Protein and Carbohydrates.— These are two words 
that may seem difficult to understand at first, but they are 
really very simple. Use the words whenever possible, 
169
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING 
and they will not seem so difficult. Have you ever made 
chewing gum by chewing the grains of wheat? This 
gum was made almost entirely of protein. It is called 
gluten in the wheat. In cheese, it is called casein. In 
the white of an egg, it is called albumen. Protein is found 
in all the field grains, in hay, in clover, in peas and in 
beans. It goes to form the flesh, the cartilage, the hair, 
the wool, and the casein and albumen of milk. It forms 
the material in the body that is used up when work is 
performed. Carbohydrates are principally the sugars and 
the starches. Granulated sugar is a pure crystallized car- 
bohydrate. Potato is composed almost entirely of starch 
and sugar. The potato is a carbohydrate. Nearly all 
fruits and vegetables are carbohydrates. The grains have 
some starch in them, and that part of them is carbohydrate. 
The same may be said of hay, grass and fodder. The 
carbohydrates are chiefly valuable in keeping up the heat 
of the body and in forming fat. 
Office of Protein and Carbohydrates.— Protein and 
corbohydrates may be likened to the coal that is put into 
the steam engine to give it power to do work. When the 
work is done, the substances are consumed or burned up. 
It is an interesting fact that the carbohydrates are much 
more easily consumed in the body than the proteins. 
When the body has work to do, or uses up fuel in keeping 
warm, it first calls on the carbohydrates for service. The 
proteins are not used until the carbohydrates are largely 
consumed ; then the proteins are called on. If more car- 
bohydrates be furnished than is necessary to keep the body 
warm and to furnish the energy for work, the body stores 
it up in the shape of fat. The dairy cow secretes it in the

udder; the beef cow and the hog lay the fat on over the 
muscles. : 
Fat.— Some foods, such as cotton-seed meal, linseed 
meal, nuts, etc., contain a considerable quantity of oil or 
fat. This is used by the animals for food in the same way 
and for the same purpose as the carbohydrates. It is, 
however, about two and one-fourth times as valuable in 
producing heat as the same quantity of carbohydrates. 
EXERCISES. 
1. Make a list of ten animal foods valuable chiefly for 
protein. 
2. Make a list of ten foods valuable chiefly as carbo- 
hydrates. 
3. Consult the Fodder Tables (p. 237), and arrange 
the foods in each list according to the relative amounts of 
protein and carbohydrate in each. 
Feeding Standards.— It is evident from the lists that 
you have made that the most expensive foods are those 
valuable chiefly for the protein which they contain. The 
economical farmer will feed these foods as sparingly as 
possible and still produce the results he desires. It has 
been found by careful testing just what proportion of 
protein and carbohydrates it is best to feed an animal. 
For instance, it has been found that, for an average dairy 
cow, about six times as much carbohydrates as protein 
should be fed for the best results. This relation is usu- 
ally expressed as a ratio, as I to 6 or 1: 6, and is called the 
nutritive ratio, This means that, for every pound of 
protein, six pounds of carbohydrates should be given.
-P-A-G-E-180
  
172 PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING 
Chemists have determined the amounts of protein and 
carbohydrates in all of the common feeding stuffs. From 
tables prepared by them, we may “ figure out” a ration 
with such foods as may be raised on the farm or pur- 
chased. It is sometimes more economical to sell certain 
feed, and to buy other feed that contains the elements 
needed to make a proper ration. 
Balanced Ration A balanced ration is a statement 
of the quantities of various feeds that will provide a nu- 
tritive ratio that is proper. Suppose we wished to make 
a balanced ration for an average dairy cow. We find 
from the Table of Nutrients (p. 243) that such a cow 
needs daily about twenty-seven pounds of dry matter. She 
needs two pounds of digestible protein, eleven pounds 
of carbohydrates, and four tenths of a pound of fat. If 
we multiply the fat required by two and one fourth, it 
will be equivalent to about one pound of carbohydrates. 
The nutritive ratio, given in the Table of Nutrients (p. 
243), is 1:6. Suppose we have clover hay, corn stover, 
bran, corn meal, and cotton-seed meal, to feed.

It must not be expected that a ration will figure out 
exactly according to the needs. The above ration is close

PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING : 173 
enough for all practical purposes. The “dry matter” 
is about five pounds short of the requirement, but that 
is not important. The figuring out of a ration for any 
animal is somewhat a matter of guessing. 
Suppose we wish to figure out a ration for a horse 
at light work and weighing one thousand pounds. We 
have on hand mixed hay, oats and bran. How much of 
each may we feed, and make a balanced ration? Let us 
look first on page 221 of the Appendix, and we see that a 
horse weighing about 1,000 pounds, at light work, re- 
quires daily 20 pounds of digestible dry matter, 1.5 
pounds of protein, and 10.4 pounds of carbohydrates (.4 
Ibs. X 24% +9.5 Ibs.), making a ratio of 1:7. That is, 
seven times as many pounds of carbohydrates and fats as 
protein should be fed: This we might call a medium 
ratio.! 
Now let us make a guess of a ration for our work horse. 
Let us take fifteen pounds of mixed hay and five pounds 
of oats, and see how close our result comes to the standard. 
From the Fodder Tables (p. 237) in the Appendix, we 
find our ration figures out as follows:

to indicate the relative amount of carbohydrates compared with the protein 
elements. A “wide” ratio means more of the carbohydrates as compared 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
174 PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING 
The ration so far is lacking in food at every point. We 
must select foods for the remainder of the ration that 
have a wide ratio. Let us add three pounds of bran. 
This will produce the following result :

Comparing our result with the standard, we find that 
we still lack .2 Ib. of dry matter of reaching the require- 
ment, but this makes but little djfference. It lacks .o2 
Ib. of the amount required for protein. As this is a very 
important element, it might be well to select some other 
food, having a narrower ratio, such as linseed meal, to be 
given in small amounts. The amount of carbohydrates 
is close enough to the standard for all practical purposes. 
It is not necessary that the ration be brought exactly to 
the standard; but, in the amounts of protein and carbo- 
hydrates, it should not vary much from it. If the 
amount of dry matter vary two or three pounds either 
way, it will make but little difference. 
Cost and Feeding.— The wise farmer will figure the 
cost of the different food stuffs very carefully to find out 
what is the most profitable to feed. It is often best to 
sell some of the foods having a wide ratio, such as hay 
“ “ with the proteins, than the “medium” ratio; a “narrow” ratio means less 
of the carbohydrates. For a dairy cow, the ratio of 1:6 might be considered 
a medium ratio; 1:4, a narrow ratio; and 1:12, a wide ratio.
-P-A-G-E-183

and potatoes, and to purchase foods having a narrow ra- 
tio, such as cotton-seed or linseed meal. 
Manurial Value of Feeding Stuffs—— On account of 
the value of certain foods as manure, it is also necessary 
to figure on the manurial value of a food as well as on its 
feeding value. From the Table on page 245, it may be 
seen that some substances are of far greater value as 
manure than others, and this fact should be considered 
in making a profitable ration, and in determining what 
foods to sell and what to purchase.

34. HORSES. 
_ Breeds.— The different breeds of horses may be classed 
as follows: 
1. Those valuable for speed. 
2. Those valuable for drawing loads. 
3. Those valuable as coach horses. 
4. Ponies. 
  Fic. 103.— One of General Grant’s Arabians. 
Horses Valuable for Speed. The Arabian horse was 
probably the origin of horses noted for speed. At pres- 
ent, it is not so speedy as many of the breeds which 
G. & M. Ag. 12. 177
-P-A-G-E-186
178 HORSES 
have sprung from it. After General Grant made his trip 
around the world, he was presented with a fine team of 
Arabians. A picture of one of them is given( Figure 103). 
The Thoroughbred horse is an animal of great endur- 
ance and great speed. The Thoroughbreds are running 
horses and are bred chiefly for racing. The breed was 
  Fic. 104.— Dan Patch, 1:56%4. 
established in England by a mixture of native stock with 
Arabian. 
The American trotting horses do not yet make a dis- 
tinct breed, but they are better known than many of the 
distinct breeds. The most important families of this class 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  HORSES 179 
are Hambletonians, Mambrinos, and Clays. The Mor- 
gans, also, belong to this class, and are probably the most 
popular for general purposes. 
Horses Valuable for Drawing Loads (Draft).— The 
draft horses differ chiefly from the horses valued for speed 
  Fic, 105.— Percheron stallion. 
in being much heavier and larger. The back is broader 
and the legs are shorter. The chief breeds are here illus- 
trated. 
The Percheron was developed in France. When the
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 HORSES 
breed was first established most of the horses were dap- 
pled gray, but the largest number are now black or dark 
brown. The Percherons are good farm horses. They 
are gentle, active, and strong. The French Draft horse 
is similar to the Percheron. 
  Fic. 106.— Clydesdale stallion. 
The English Shire horse is low, broad, and stout. It 
is not a very active breed and is adapted to drawing heavy 
loads with slow motion. 
The Clydesdale, a native of Scotland, is a well muscled, 
well proportioned horse. Fine long hair grows from the 
edge of the lower legs. The Clydesdale has a rapid walk 
and is a very useful and popular farm horse.
-P-A-G-E-189
  
HORSES 181 
Coach Horses.— These horses are in size and form be- 
tween the speed horses and the draft horses, having some 
of the qualities of each. The chief breeds are the French 
Coach, the Cleveland Bay, the German Coach and the 
Hackney horse. 
Ponies.— These horses are much smaller than other 
breeds. 
  
  Fic. 107.— Coach horses. 
The Shetland ponies, originating in the Shetland 
Islands, near the west coast of Scotland, are bred for 
their small size. They are especially adapted for chil- 
dren’s use. 
The Indian’ ponies, in the northern part of the United 
States, and the mustangs, in the southern part, originated 
from the horses brought to this country by the early ex- 
plorers from Spain and France. Both the Indian Pony 
and the Mustang are valuable as saddle animals.
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 HORSES 
Care of Horses.— The horse is a noble animal, of fine 
spirit and sensibilities, and requires careful treatment. 
. Kind treatment and gen- 
tle handling will give 
the horse a good dispo- 
sition, and will save 
money in feed besides. 
It will pay to figure out 
a good ration for the 
horse from the tables 
given in the Appendix. 
A well-balanced ration 
will keep a horse in good 
condition without over- 
feeding. Young people 
who have read “ Black 
Beauty ” will sympathize with the horse, and will give 
him the best of treatment. 
SOME HORSE SENSE. 
(From Biggle. Book.)     Fic. 108.— Shetland pony. 
Be gentle, be kind, be patient. 
The brush will save oats. 
If you must put frosty bits in some mouth, let it be 
your own. Suffering begets sympathy. 
Many a horse stands up all night because his stall is 
not made so that he can lie down in comfort. 
You can not whip terror out of a horse, or pound cour- 
age into one. If he shies or becomes frightened, soothe 
and encourage him rather than beat and abuse him. 
A horse can travel safer and better if he is not checked 
too high. By all means let your working horse have his 
head.

35. SHEEP. 
Breeds of Sheep.— Sheep are raised for their mutton 
and for their wool. The breeds are often classified ac- 
cording to the fineness of their wool. The fine-wooled 
sheep are the Merino, the Delaine, and the Rambouillet. 
The medium-wooled breeds are the Southdown, the 
  Fic. 109.— American Merino ram, four years old. 
Shropshire, the Dorset, the Hampshire, the Oxford, and 
the Cheviot. The long-wooled sheep are the Leicester, 
the Cotswold, and the Lincoln. 
Fine-wooled Sheep.— The Merino is a native of Spain, 
and is distinguished by the large wrinkles on its neck and 
body, and its fine, oily wool. The wool of this sheep is

  SHEEP 185 
good mutton. Large numbers of Merinos are raised in 
the southwestern states of our country. They are par- 
ticularly adapted to warm climates. 
The Delaine is de- 
scended from the 
Merino. It is larger 
and stronger than 
the Merino, and is 
freer from  wrink- 
les. This breed is 
coming in favor for 
its mutton. 
The Rambouillet, 
or French Merinos, 
are the largest of the 
Merinos and have a 
mutton form. The 
fleece is not so heavy 
in proportion to the 
size of the sheep as 
the Merinos: Fic. 112,— Shropshire yearling. 
The Cheviot is a native of the hills between England 
and Scotland. It is a hardy breed and produces a wool 
adapted to make the cheviot cloth. The entire head and 
the legs are pure white. 
The Medium-wooled Breeds.— The Southdown, the 
smallest of the medium-wooled breeds, is an English 
sheep. It is hornless, its head and legs being of a gray- 
brown color. The wool is of medium fineness, but the 
sheep is valuable chiefly for its production of mutton. 
The Shropshire sheep takes its name from the county of

notice. It resembles the Southdown in appearance. It

is especially adapted for the lowlands, thus being prob- 
ably the best all-purpose sheep for the central part of 
the United States. 
The Dorset is valuable chiefly in producing winter 
lambs. Both the rams and the ewes have horns. They 
are considerably larger than the Southdowns. The head 
and legs are white. 
The Horned Dorset is an English breed. Its nose, 
  Fig. 115. Lincoln ram. 
hoofs and legs are white, and it has a tuft of wool on its 
forehead. The Horned Dorsets are not so important or 
so widely distributed as the Merinos. 
The Hampshire is similar to the Shropshire, but is 
larger and coarser. 
The Oxford is the largest of this class of sheep. 
Neither the Hampshire nor the Oxford sheep are widely 
distributed in the United States. 
The Long-wooled Breeds.— The Leicester, Cotswold,
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 SHEEP 
and Lincoln are English sheep bred chiefly for their long 
wool. They are of large size and require rich pasturage. 
They are not popular breeds in the United States. 
Advantage of Sheep Production Rough and scanty 
pasturage that would be too poor for other farm animals, 
may often be used to raise sheep. As a result, also, the 
fertility of the land is greatly increased, and weeds are 
kept down. The profits from sheep raising under favor- 
able conditions are greater than those from raising stock 
of any other kind.
-P-A-G-E-197
  36. SWINE. 
Breeds of Swine.— The different breeds of swine are 
divided into classes according to size. ‘The most impor- 
tant breeds of hogs are the Berkshire, the Poland-China, 
the Duroc Jersey, the Tamworth, the Large Yorkshire, 
and the Chester White. 
  Fic. 116.— Texas razor back hog. 
The Berkshires.— The Berkshires are black, with white 
markings on the head, feet, and sometimes on the front 
legs. The head is thick and short and the face is dished. 
The Poland-Chinas.— This breed is black, with white 
markings on the head and feet. The head is short and 
thick, with slightly dished face and small, drooping ears. 
The Duroc Jerseys.— These swine are red or light 
brown. They have short heads, with slightly dished 
189

faces, and drooping ears. The body is compact and 
plump and resembles that of the Poland-Chinas. 
  Fie. 117.— Berkshire hog. 
The Large Yorkshires.— This breed is white. They 
have long, narrow bodies, medium length heads, erect 
ears, and much dished faces.

The Tamworths.— These hogs are red or brown in 
salor, like the Duroc Jerseys, but they have longer legs

and slimmer bodies than that breed. The nose is long 
and straight, and the ears are erect. 
  Fic. 120.— Tamworth hog. 
The Chester Whites— As the name indicates, these 
hogs are white. The head is short and slightly dished. 
The ears are drooping and the body is large and compact. 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  
192 SWINE 
The Advantage of Swine Raising.— A pound of swine 
flesh can be produced more cheaply than a pound of flesh 
in any other farm animal. The hog is built so compactly 
that there is very little waste in slaughtering, and it will 
eat many kinds of food that could not be disposed of 
otherwise. If hogs are kept in clean quarters and are fed 
  Fic. 121.— Chester White hog. 
properly, they are not likely to become diseased. Under 
such conditions, hog raising is a profitable industry. 
EXERCISES. 
1. Make a ration, consisting of skim milk and corn, 
for a young pig weighing from fifty to one hundred 
pounds. 
2. Make a ration, consisting of whey and middlings, 
for a hog weighing two hundred pounds. 
3. A hog weighing one hundred and fifty pounds is 
to be fattened with corn and middlings. Make a ration 
adapted for this purpose.

  St... POULTRY (lL Uy ITV), 
The Profit of Poultry Raising.— The importance of the 
poultry business has not been appreciated by the farmers. 
The value of the poultry and eggs produced in the United 
States in one year amounts to about one-half billion 
dollars. If proper attention were given to this industry 
on the farm, a much larger profit might be secured. A 
small flock of not to exceed fifty hens, with careful atten- 
tion, will add a considerable amount to the farmer’s in- 
come. It often happens that those who are unable to do 
heavy work on the farm may employ their time with 
profit in caring for poultry. 
Breeds of Chickens.— It pays to keep nothing but pure 
bred fowls on the farm. The common or mongrel stock 
will eat just as much and will require just as much care 
as the pure bred stock, and, as a rule, they do not pro- 
duce so well. 
Chickens may be raised chiefly for the eggs which they 
lay. They are then called “egg breeds.” They may 
be raised for their flesh. These are called ‘“‘ meat breeds.” 
Both of these objects may be served, and the fowl belong 
to the “ general purpose” breeds. 
Egg Breeds.— The best known egg breeds are the Leg- 
horn, the Minorca, and the Houdan, 
The Leghorns may be brown, white, black or buff. 
They are rather small, nervous fowls, with large red 
combs and wattles. They are great layers, but they do 
G. & M. Ag. 13. 193 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  194 POULTRY 
not sit. The Leghorns should not be kept in close con- 
finement, but should be allowed a large range. 
The Minorcas are either black or white. They, also, 
have large combs. Under proper conditions, they are 
extra good layers. The flesh is not regarded as the best 
for table use. 
The Houdans are beautiful fowls. They have a top- 
knot of feathers on the head and V-shaped combs. They 
have five toes on each foot instead of four, the usual 
number. They are good layers and non-sitters. Were 
it not for the fact that they are rather delicate, and that 
the topknots on the head prevents their seeing danger 
easily, they would be one of the most popular breeds. 
Meat Breeds.— The Brahmas are the most important 
of the meat breeds. The Light Brahmas are the largest 
variety of fowl. They lay large brown eggs, and are 
good sitters. They bear confinement well, and are quiet 
in disposition. The legs and toes are heavily feathered. 
The Dark Brahmas are similar to the Light Brahmas, 
but are about one pound lighter in weight. 
The Cochins, of which there are four breeds,— the 
Partridge, Buff, Black, and White,—are the hardiest 
of all the breeds. The feathers are heavy and extend 
down over the toes. The Cochins are good sitters and 
fair layers. 
The Cornish Indian Games are a distinct meat breed. 
The meat on the breast is plentiful and delicious. They 
are poor layers, but good sitters. 
The General Purpose Breeds.— The Plymouth Rocks 
are the most popular class of fowls in America. There 
are three breeds: the Barred, the White, and the Buff.
-P-A-G-E-203
  POULTRY 195 
They are hardy, beautiful, good layers, and fairly good 
sitters. The meat is good for table use. 
The Wyandottes are close to the Plymouth Rocks in 
popularity. Many think them the better fowl for gen- 
eral purposes. They have compact bodies, are fairly 
good sitters and are splendid layers. They lay dark 
eggs and are good table fowls. 
Care of Fowls.— Choose a place for the poultry house 
that shall have good drainage. A southern or south- 
eastern slope is best, so that the fowls may have plenty 
of sunshine, and be protected from the northwest wind. 
  Fic. 122.— A good hen-house with shed. 
Build a snug, comfortable house for the chickens to live 
in at night. Houses that are comfortable save much 
grain, and encourage hens to lay in winter. Attached 
to the hen-house should be a larger, more open scratch- 
ing shed. Make this large enough to furnish about four 
square feet of scratching surface for each hen. The 
scratching shed should open toward the south, so that the 
fowls may get the full benefit of the sunshine. In a 
sunny corner of the shed, a box, filled with fine dust 
scraped from the road in the summer time, should be 
placed. Chickens delight in the dust bath, and it helps
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 POULTRY 
to free them from lice. The floor of the shed should be 
covered with chopped straw or chaff. The grain may 
be thrown in this to give the poultry proper exercise in 
scratching and picking it out. 
Feeding.— As much care should be exercised in feed- 
ing chickens as in feeding a dairy cow. The balanced 
a ration will give the best results. 
If the chickens are allowed to 
range over the farm, they will 
usually supply themselves with 
food that has the proper pro- 
portion of egg-forming and of 
Fic, 123— Homemade drinking fat-forming material. They fountain. will pick up grain, seeds, in- 
sects, and green blades of grass. When they are kept in 
a yard, these varieties of food should be supplied in proper 
proportions. 
Chickens need plenty of pure water. This should be 
supplied in dishes that are cleaned regularly. A lard 
pail or other can may be filled with water and turned over 
suddenly in a shallow pan-or in a flower-pot saucer. A 
little niche or hole near the edge of the pail or can will 
allow the water to flow into the pan or saucer as it is 
needed. 
Poultry should have some green food, vegetables or 
cut grass, grain of some kind, preferably corn, and meat. 
It is necessary that meat be fed to the hens in the winter 
time, if they are expected to lay. The meat furnishes the 
albumen for the eggs. Beets or cabbage heads may be 
hung just out of reach of the poultry, so they must jump 
up to peck at them. This will furnish the green food   
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  
POULTRY 197 
necessary in the winter, as well as giving the poultry 
needed exercise. Cracked oyster shells, crushed glass or 
other forms of grit, should be placed where the chickens 
can get all they want. This helps in the digestion of 
other food, and forms the bones of the poultry and the 
shells of the eggs. 
Parasites.— Poultry are often afflicted with lice and 
with mites. The lice breed on the chickens, and live 
upon them. The mites live in the cracks in the roosts, 
in the nests, and in the walls. They come out in the 
night time and suck the blood of the fowls. To destroy 
the lice, sprinkle the chickens with insect powder fre- 
quently. To destroy the mites, the poultry house should 
be kept thoroughly clean. The entire inside of the house, 
including roosts and boxes, should be washed with coal 
oil every other week. Roosts, boxes, and platforms 
should be made movable, so that they may be taken out 
for thorough cleaning.

taised just as well where there is no swimming pond, 
though they get much food from the pond if they have 
the chance. 
Ducks are hatched best under a hen. She is also the 
best mother for them. Ducklings should not be allowed 
to go into the water for the first ten days. 
198
-P-A-G-E-207
  
DUCKS AND TURKEYS 199 
Breeds of Ducks.— The Pekin duck is the best duck 
for profit. It is easily kept, is a good layer, and brings 
the highest price in the market. Its white feathers may 
be sold for a good price. 
The Rouen duck is beautifully colored, and is prob- 
ably descended directly from the wild duck,— the 
Mallard. 
The Cayuga is jet black in plumage, and originated in 
New York. 
The Aylesburg is the favorite English variety. It is 
pure dead white. 
TURKEYS. 
Wild turkeys were quite plentiful in America before 
it was well settled. The turkey on our farms was derived 
from the wild turkey. 
The meat of the turkey is more desired than that of 
any other fowl, and it brings the highest price in the 
market. 
The turkey is of a roving disposition, and does not do 
well when kept in a small enclosure. It is best not to 
attempt to keep turkeys in a poultry house. They thrive 
better when allowed to roost outdoors. 
The turkey hen seeks an out-of-the-way place to lay 
her eggs. She goes far from the house to make her nest 
and to rear her young. Sometimes turkeys go a half a 
mile or more and make their nests in a fence corner or 
in a brush heap. They may be enticed to nest nearer 
home by setting a few boards or an old door against a 
fence corner, and throwing a bunch of hay under it, or 
by placing barrels and boxes with hay in them on the
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 DUCKS AND TURKEYS 
ground in some secluded spot. The young turkeys, or 
poults, as they are called, are very delicate, and, until 
they are ten or twelve weeks old, they should be cared for 
in coops. They should not be let out of the coop in the 
morning until the dew is off the grass. 
The Bronze Turkey.— This is the largest, the most 
popular, and the most profitable of all the breeds. The 
gobblers weigh about thirty-six pounds, and the turkey 
hens about twenty pounds. This breed furnishes the 
largest part of the turkey meat for Thanksgiving and 
Christmas feasts.
-P-A-G-E-209
  39. BEE-KEEPING. 
  Bees and Flowers.— Every country boy or girl knows 
that nectar is gathered by bees. These little workers fly 
about from flower to flower, collect the nectar drop by 
drop, with wonderful industry and patience, and carry it 
home, where, after freeing it of much of the water which 
it contains, and adding a preservative acid, they store it 
away in regular tiers of waxen cells. Then when the 
weather is so cold that they can not leave the home, they 
have food on which to live. Bees do not injure the 
   Worker. Queen. Drone

flowers which they: visit. On the contrary, they help 
them to bear more seed and fruit. Our orchards and 
berry fields yield more and better fruit because of the bees. 
Social Life of the Bees.— Wild bees live in hollow 
trees, or sometimes in crevices in rocks; but the honey 
of the market is gathered by tame bees,— that is, by bees 
that are kept on the farm. Bees live in large families or 
colonies, each of which has its queen. Each colony, or, 
as it is frequently called, “swarm,” lives in its own 
and the bees of one hive are not wel- 
201 house or “ hive,”
-P-A-G-E-210
    
202 BEE-KEEPING 
come in another. Each worker bee is armed with a sting, 
with which to protect its home, but the skilful bee-keeper 
learns to control his bees so that they do not often use 
their stings. 
The Workers, the Queen, and the Drone.— The 
worker bee is the smallest bee in the hive. It takes the 
little scales of wax that form between the rings on 
the abdomen and makes the comb. The oil which is 
made from the food eaten by the bee finds its way through 
the bee’s body and hardens into waxy scales. The bee 
plucks a wax scale from its abdomen with its leg-pinchers 
and passes it forward to its mouth, where it is chewed. 
The wax is then ready to be made into the six-sided cells 
which make the comb. The workers also fill the cells 
with the honey which they make from the nectar of the 
flowers. The cells are not all of the same size. Some 
are made for holding honey; others in which the queen 
lays eggs, are sometimes used also to hold honey or 
pollen, often called beebread. This beebread is a sticky 
mass that the bees make by moistening the pollen which 
they gather from flowers. It is of various colors and 
somewhat sweetish to the taste. 
The queen bee lays her eggs in three separate sets of 
cells, placing one egg in each cell. In the small cells, 
she lays eggs that are to become the workers; in the cells 
next larger, she lays the eggs that will become drones 
when they are hatched. Finally, she lays a few eggs in 
some large cells built on the edge of the comb. These 
are called royal cells, and the eggs in them may hatch 
queens if they are furnished with the proper kind of food 
by the workers,
-P-A-G-E-211
BEE-KEEPING 203 
The drones, as you might think from the name, do not 
gather honey; neither do they have stings. They are 
the male bees in the hive, and the workers, after the har- 
vest is ended, drive the drones out of the hive and let 
them starve, or sting them to death if they attempt to 
return. 
Life in the Hive.—In every hive or colony of bees, 
there are more worker cells than any other kind, for it is 
the busy workers that make up the colony. Among 
these, there are a great many that act as nurses in the 
hive. These nurse bees take charge of the larve and 
feed them. As the larvee lie curled up in 
their cells, they look like little white worms. 
The nurse bees constantly feed the larve; 
first, when young, a sort of “ bee-milk” 
secreted by glands in their own heads, and, 
later, when the larve are older, a mixture 
of this secretion with honey and pollen, or, 
at last, only honey and pollen. When the 
larvee have eaten all they need, they fc. 126.—Larva 
straighten out their small bodies and the ote 
workers put a cap on the cell, made up of wax, mixed 
with gnawings of cocoons, pollen grains, and silk threads. 
This is porous and permits air to reach the developing 
insect. Each larva then spins a silken cocoon about 
itself and goes to sleep in its waxen cradle. 
Tt takes usually twenty-one days from the time the egg 
is laid until the perfect worker bee casts aside its silken 
wrap, gnaws open the cell cover and comes out with four 
thin wings. The young queens develop in about sixteen 
days; but drones require twenty-four days. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
204 BEE-KEEPING 
Many of the honey cells are left open a week or more 
after they are filled; for the bees will not cap them over 
with wax until they know that the honey in them is 
“ripe,” or ready to be sealed up. So it is always easy 
for the young bee to find an open cell where it can eat all 
it wants. 
When a few days old the workers act as nurse bees, and 
fly out only for exercise, but, in a couple of weeks they 
gain full use of their wings and go outside to work with 
the older bees. It is well that it begins its work at once, 
for the length of a worker bee’s life is but a few months 
at most, and some of them live only a few weeks. Queen 
bees, however, have been known to live four or five years. 
A great many bees in the hive die during the winter; 
but the queen bee begins to lay her eggs in midwinter or 
very early in the spring, and those eggs hatch out so fast 
that the number in the hive is soon as large as ever. A 
large number of young bees come out of the cells every 
day during the hatching season, which lasts through the 
- warm summer months, 
oh, and thus the hive is al- 
cy ways kept full.

called “swarming.” The bees protect the immature 
queen-cells until the eldest queen emerges, which usually 
occurs a week after the first swarm issues. Should the
-P-A-G-E-213
  
BEE-KEEPING 205 
colony be sufficiently strong, this young queen will lead 
out a second swarm, and, in case no further swarming is 
decided upon, the next queen which emerges will be per- 
mitted, and even assisted, by the workers in destroying 
the remaining queen-cells. The bee-keeper often takes 
advantage of this opportunity to secure from the numer- 
ous cells formed, surplus queens for colonies that have 
chanced to lose their own. 
If the new queens are not removed as soon as they 
come out of their cells, the ruling queen will seek them 
out, and sting them to death. 
When the bees “swarm,” they gather about the queen 
in a black, buzzing mass, and may alight on the limb of a 
tree. As soon as possible, spread out a white cloth under 
the tree. Set upon this a clean, cool hive and shake the 
bees in front of it, propping up 
the hive so as to let them enter. 
The limb may be cut from the 
tree with the adhering bees, or 
they may be shaken directly into 
a large basket and poured out in 
front of the empty hive. A comb 
containing unsealed brood, if 
placed in the hive, will serve as a 
great attraction to them. Their 
strong sense of smell will guide + 
them toward it cand “they: will $1 ‘48: Honeveamb, 
enter their new home joyfully. Plenty of air should 
be given at both the top and bottom of the hive, since 
the bees are usually much heated by the excitement of 
swarming. 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  206 BEE-KEEPING 
Comb Honey and Extracted Honey.— In a modern 
bee-hive, each comb is built by the bees in a movable 
frame, so that the bee-keeper can remove the combs at 
will. 
After the hive is well stored with honey, small frames 
on sections are placed over the brood chamber of the 
hive for the bees to fill with comb and honey. Honey in 
the cells is called “ comb honey.” 
Sometimes the combs are removed from the hive as 
fast as they are filled with honey, and placed in a ma- 
chine called a “ honey extractor.” Here they are caused 
to revolve so rapidly that the honey is thrown out of the 
cells. It then appears as a thick liquid like syrup, and is 
called “ extracted honey.” 
The combs are then replaced in the hive for the bees 
to fill again with honey. Bees do not like to see empty 
cells in their hive, and they will work very hard to fill 
them. The extracting process, therefore, causes bees to 
make more honey than they would if the honey were 
left in the cells. 
Sources of Honey.— Although many kinds of flowers 
yield some honey, the honey that bees store up in their 
hives is mostly secured from a few kinds. White and 
alsike clovers, alfalfa, basswood, raspberry, sourwood, 
sweet clover, white sage, black mangrove, tulip or “ pop- 
lar” trees, buckwheat, and asters yield the greater part 
of the honey on the market. Honey bees are able to 
secure only a small part of the honey from flowers of the 
red clover. 
Crops are not often grown on purpose for bees, as this 
would not generally prove profitable,
-P-A-G-E-215
  BEE-KEEPING 207 
Profits in Bee-keeping.— In sections where honey- 
yielding flowers are numerous, and not too many bees 
are kept, bee-keeping may often be made a profitable 
addition to the industries of the farm. The bees gather 
their honey wherever they can find it, and no one disputes 
their right. 
Bee-keeping by modern methods requires watchful 
care and skillful management. The work connected with 
it is, however, very light, and is easily performed by 
women. 
With good management, bees yield a considerable in- 
come to the owner. It is necessary, however, to protect 
them from their enemies, shelter them through the win- 
ter, and furnish them with sufficient food when the flow- 
ers are not in blossom. 
Races of Bees. — There are numerous breeds or races 
of bees: the common brown or black bees, the Italians, 
the Carniolans, the Cyprians, the Syrians, and the Cau- 
casians. The first two are most widely spread and much 
intermixed throughout the country. Any bees possess- 
ing black blood should be avoided, because of their spite- 
fulness and inability to defend their hives wholly against 
the wax moths and other bee enemies. They are also 
less industrious than the Italians. The Carniolans are 
quite prolific, excellent honey gatherers and very gentle; 
being quite hardy, they winter and breed well in the cold- 
est of climates, and their comb honey is of snowy white- 
ness. The Cyprians gather the most honey and are the 
best defenders of their hives, but require quite skillful 
handling, as they are very vindictive when aroused. The 
Syrians are similar, but not superior, to the Cyprians.
-P-A-G-E-216
208 BEE-KEEPING 
The Caucasians, recently introduced by the United States 
Department of Agriculture, are the gentlest of all known . 
races, and may be kept on the lawn or in the flower 
garden and handled at any time without protection and 
with no fear of stings; they are also diligent workers, 
and produce honey equal to that of any of the others.

40. IMPROVEMENT OF HOME AND 
SCHOOL YARDS. 
Home and School Yards.— It is not enough that our 
farms produce large crops to be sold at good prices and 
the business thus be made profitable. We should also 
look to our surroundings. We should have good, com- 
fortable, well-arranged homes, and the grounds about 
them should be made as attractive as possible. We shall 
be better men and women if we live in beautiful sur- 
roundings than if we live in poorly-kept and ugly quar- 
ters. Schoolhouses and school yards, too, should be 
made as beautiful as possible. A great many people 
would be glad to have beautiful homes and schoolhouses 
and fine yards if they but knew how to obtain them at 
small cost. School children who are interested can do 
much toward beautifying the entire neighborhood in 
which they live. 
A few general directions are given that may help in 
making our homes and our schools delightful places in 
which to live. 
Make a Plan.—It is well to make a plan before attempt- 
ing any change of things as they are. This will make it 
easy to do part of the work this year, to add to it next 
year, and so on until the plan is carried out. Without 
a plan, we may make improvements that we shall find do

  210 LANDSCAPE GARDENING 
not lend beauty to our surroundings, and our work will 
be entirely lost. Do not make a very complex plan. A 
simple one, with few details, is much better. 
Natural Features Many places have some natural 
features that aid in the work of beautifying them. A 
clump of trees, a small hill, a stream of water, or a pond, 
found on the place, should be used in the plan you make. 
Do not try to get rid of such things, but lay out a plan 
that will use them to the best advantage. 
  Fic. 129.— A problem in landscape gardening. 
The House the Important Part— The house should 
usually be the most important part of the plan. It need 
not be in the middle of the lot, but other things should be 
so grouped about it as to set it off. So often we see a 
house rising boldly from the center of a yard, with no 
adornment whatever. Here we see such a house in all 
its loneliness. It looks cheerless, and no amount of 
money spent on it will make it look homelike, unless the
-P-A-G-E-219

shrubbery, the trees, and the yard in general are planned 
to make the house a part of the whole.

-P-A-G-E-220
    
212 LANDSCAPE GARDENING 
Open Front Yards.— Very often we find that the yard 
in front of a house is filled with shrubbery or with flower 
beds. It is far better to leave the space in front of the 
house entirely open. The house is then shown to much 
better advantage, and the yard is much more easily cared 
for. There is nothing much more pleasing than a well- 
kept front lawn. 
  Fic. 132.— Too many straight paths. 
Shrubbery and Flowers.— The shrubbery should be 
arranged in masses, and not with the shrubs placed 
singly. Let the branches grow thickly, so as to make a 
“mass of green. These masses should be placed on the 
border of the yard. With the flowers, they make a fine
-P-A-G-E-221
LANDSCAPE GARDENING 213 
frame for the “ picture” we are trying to make. Shrubs 
may be placed, also, so as to hide outbuildings or to form 
a screen for the backyard. 
Flowers may be planted close to the house or just in 
front of the shrubbery. Théy should not be planted in 
separate flower beds in the lawn. 
Vines.— Vines may be used to cover old fences, or to

clamber over old or unpainted buildings, with very good 
effect. With vines alone, an unpleasing place may be 
changed to a very beautiful one. Vines are also useful 
in helping to make the house a part of the “ picture.” 
Trees.— Trees may be planted in groups about the  
-P-A-G-E-222
    214 LANDSCAPE GARDENING 
yard. They should be placed so as to be of some use, 
either in giving shade or in forming a wind break. Ever- 
green trees and hard wood trees should not be planted in 
the same group. If evergreen trees are planted, they 
should not be trimmed and the lower branches should not 
be cut. They look much prettier in their natural con- 
dition (Figure 131). 
Paths.— There should be as few paths as possible, 
and these should be placed so that they will be the 
most convenient. Care should be taken to avoid straight 
lines in laying out the paths. Sometimes a straight path 
is necessary from the street to the house, but, when it is 
possible, the paths should be made on large easy curves. 
Barns and Other Buildings.— It is not easy to tell just 
where and how the barns, stables, granaries and other 
farm buildings should be placed. Much depends upon 
local conditions. 
The barns and stables should not be placed very close 
to the house, but at such a distance that the barnyard 
odors and the flies will not be troublesome. The gar- 
den, however, may be placed quite near the house, so that 
it may be easily tended and watched. 
If the barns and stables are built in the form of a hol- 
low square, with one side left open, they will give pro- 
tection against the winds in winter and will furnish 
shade in summer 
School Yards.— The school yards should be models for 
the whole community. Even if the schoolhouse is not 
a fine building, it may be made very attractive by im- 
provements. The principles of landscape gardening
-P-A-G-E-223
LANDSCAPE GARDENING 215 
which have been given for homes apply also to school 
yards. 
In the country, where land is cheap, there is no reason 
why the school should not be supplied with a large plot of 
land. This will furnish room for a lawn and for a good- 
sized playground. In many places, also, one part of 
the school ground may be set apart for a school garden, 
where plants of different kinds may be raised and where 
the principles of plant growth may be taught. Unless 
  Fic. 134.— A bare school yard. 
some arrangement is made for the care of the school 
garden during the summer vacation, however, it is likely 
to become a garden of weeds. 
The picture shown in Figure 134 is a very common 
one, much more common than it should be. Notice how 
bare and cheerless it is. 
In Figure 135, we see what has been done with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-224

school yard to make it attractive and homelike. The 
teacher and the pupils in the school did‘all the work, and, 
with no expense, made this wonderful improvement. The 
shrubbery and trees were obtained by the boys from the 
woods. Flower seeds and bulbs were given by the par- 
ents and were planted by the girls under the direction of 
the teacher. All worked together to make the school yard 
beautiful, and were very proud of the result.

Directions for Using the Babcock Test. 
Sampling the Milk.— Great care should be taken to 
have the sample of milk represent as nearly as possible 
the whole lot from which it was taken. Milk fresh from 
the cow, while it is still warm and before the cream has 
separated in a layer, may be thoroughly mixed by pouring 
it three or four times from one vessel to another. Sam- 
ples taken at once from milk mixed in this way give the 
best results. Milk that has stood until a layer of cream 
has formed should be poured a greater number of times 
so that the cream shall be thoroughly broken up and the 
whole appear like milk. .No clots of cream should appear 
on the surface when the milk is left quiet for a minute. 
Measuring the Milk.— When the milk has been well 
mixed, the milk pipette is filled by placing its lower end 
in the milk and sucking at the upper end until the milk 
rises above the mark on the stem; then remove the pipette 
from the mouth and quickly close the tube at the upper 
end by firmly pressing the tip of the index finger upon 
it so the milk cannot flow from the pipette. Holding the 
pipette up straight, with the mark on a level with the 
eye, carefully admit air slowly to the space above 
the milk, till the upper surface of the milk falls -to 
the mark upon the stem. Always have the upper

bottle. milk if the finger is wet. Next, 
place the point of the pipette in 
the mouth of one of the test bot- 
tles, held in a slightly slanting 
position so that the milk can flow 
down the side of the tube, and re- 
move the finger, allowing the 
milk to flow into the bottle. After 
waiting a short time for the 
pipette to drain, blow into the 
upper end to expel all the milk. 
Adding the Acid.— When the 
milk has been measured into the 
test bottles, the necessary amount 
of acid may be added immedi- 
ately or the bottles may be left 
for a day or two without mate- 
tially changing the results. 
The amount of acid required 
for a test is about the same as that 
of the7mille: 07.5) ci. -c: fom-the 
ordinary test. If too little acid is 
added, the casein is not all held in 
solution throughout the test, and 
an imperfect separation of the fat 
results. If too much acid is used, 
the fat itself is attacked. Great 
care must be taken in handling the 
acid to avoid getting any of it on the skin or clothing.
-P-A-G-E-227
  HELPFUL FACTS AND FIGURES 219 
The acid measure is filled to the 17.5 c.c. mark with 
acid, which is then carefully poured into a test bottle 
containing milk. The bottle should be held in a slightly 
slanting position so that the acid may flow down its 
side and not come in contact with the milk too suddenly 
and thus act upon it unevenly. The acid being heavier 
than the milk, sinks directly to the bottom of the test bot- 
tle without mixing with the milk, which floats upon it. 
The acid and milk should now be thoroughly mixed by 
being gently shaken with a rotary motion. The mixture 
becomes quite hot and soon changes to a dark brown color. 
Whirling the Bottles.— The test bottles containing the 
mixture of milk and acid may be placed in the machine 
directly after the acid is added, or they may be allowed 
to stand several hours without harm. An even number 
of bottles should be whirled at the same time, and they 
should be placed in the wheel in pairs opposite each other. 
When all the test bottles have been placed in the appara- 
tus, the cover should be placed upon the jacket and the 
machine turned at such a rate that the wheel carrying 
the bottles shall make from 700 to 1,200 revolutions per 
minute. This motion must be kept up for six or seven 
minutes. 
Adding Hot Water.— As soon as the bottles have been 
sufficiently whirled, pour in enough hot water to bring 
the mixture up to the bottom of the neck. Put the bottles 
into the machine and whirl them again for about three 
minutes. Now pour in enough hot water to bring all the 
fat up into the neck of bottle, where it may be measured. 
Measuring the Fat.— To measure the fat, take a bottle 
from its socket, and, holding it in an upright position  
-P-A-G-E-228
    220 APPENDIX 
with the scale on a level with the eye, observe the divi- 
sions which mark the highest and lowest limits of the fat. 
The fat should be read from the extreme top of the curved 
upper surface, and not from the bottom or middle of 
the same. The difference between these divisions gives 
the per cent of fat directly. The reading can easily be 
taken to half divisions or to one-tenth of one per cent. 
Example.— If the figures on the necks of the bottles 
gave the per cent of butter fat, for example, as from 0 
to 3, there would be three per cent. The spaces between 
the figures represent one per cent, and each space between 
the lines represents two tenths of one per cent. Thus, if 
the bottom of the oil in the neck of the bottle stood at 
the figure 2 and the top of the third fine line above the 
figure 6, there would be four and six tenths per cent 
(4.6 per cent). Each per cent represents one pound of 
butter fat in one hundred pounds of milk. 
Amount of Butter— It must be remembered that the 
Babcock Test gives only the amount of butter fat in the 
milk or cream, and that the butter itself contains several 
substances besides butter fat, so that the amount of butter 
shows an increase of from ten per cent to eighteen per 
cent. Hence, in figuring the amount of butter made, 
this increase should be added to the amount of butter fat 
which is shown by the Babcock Test. 
Silage. 
Grass, clover, corn fodder and cow peas, when fed in 
the green state, are relished by farm animals much more 
than after they are cured. Much of the nutriment of 
plants is lost in the process of curing and the matter is 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
HELPFUL FACTS AND FIGURES 221 
made less digestible. It has been found that corn fodder 
loses nearly one fourth in digestible matter by being 
allowed to cure in the 
field. Although grass, 
clover and fodder can 
not be kept in their 
fresh green state by be- 
ing put in a silo, they 
can be preserved in this 
manner so that they 
undergo only ya 
changes.

lage are often made. To make the silage more easily 
handled and more easily eaten by the cattle, the fodder is 
usually made fine by cutting before it is put in the silo. 
A silo may be built inside or outside the barn. It may 
be built above the ground or it may be dug in the ground 
like a cistern. The matter of greatest importance is to 
make the silo air-tight. If air is admitted, the silage 
decays and becomes unfit for use. 
Round silos, built either of brick, of cement, or of 
wood, are becoming very popular. They hold more 
silage than square silos of equal size. The silage settles 
more evenly in them, also, and there is no loss from de- 
cayed silage in corners. The silage at the top of a silo 
decays and forms a pasty mass which prevents the air 
from passing through to the material below. This thin 
layer of decayed silage serves as an air-tight cover for 
the silo.

The government first establishes two lines from which 
to commence the survey. A line, called a Principal 
Meridian, is run north and south, and a line, called a Base 
Line, is run east and west across the principal meridian. 
Commencing with the principal meridian, distances of 
six miles are measured off on the base line, and, from

these points lines are run directly north and south. 
Commencing with the base line, distances of six miles are 
measured on the principal meridian, and lines through 
these points are run east and west parallel with the base 
line. These lines, north and south, and east and west, 
divide the land into townships. These are about six 
miles square, and contain about thirty-six square miles 
each. 
A row of townships running north and south is called 
a Range. 
Lines running north and south converge toward the 
north; i.e., they get closer together as they run north.

How to Tell the Age of a Horse. 
The appearance of a horse’s teeth is a pretty sure in- 
dication of his age. 
The first year, the colt cuts its twelve front teeth and 
sixteen grinders. They all show the mark on the 
grinding surface. 
At the end of the second year, the marks on the two 
front teeth (the nippers) are much worn out, and the 
next two teeth are somewhat worn. 
At the end of the third year, the horse has lost his 
four front baby teeth, and at the end of the fourth year, 
all the baby teeth are replaced by permanent teeth.
-P-A-G-E-237
      HELPFUL FACTS AND FIGURES 229 
The fifth year shows the nippers grown 
Jong, and the sharp edges worn down 
somewhat. 
The sixth year shows the dark marks 
in the nippers on the lower jaw worn 
out. 
Seven years find the four front teeth 
worn. 
Eight years find all the teeth worn, so 
that the marks in the centers can not be 
seen. 
At nine, the upper nippers have almost 
lost the marks. At this age, also, the 
upper corner teeth show curves in their 
surfaces. 
At ten, the marks in the middle upper 
teeth have changed from oblong to nearly 
circular. At eleven, all of the upper teeth 
show the same change. 
At twelve, the lower nippers have be- 
come nearly round. At thirteen, the 
middle lower teeth are nearly round; at 
fourteen, all are round. 
At fifteen years, the upper nippers are 
rounded; at sixteen, the upper middle, 
and, at seventeen, all the uppers have the 
same shape. At eighteen, the lower nip- 
pers become three-cornered; at nineteen, 
the middle ones. 
At twenty, all the lower teeth are tri- 
angular.

  230 APPENDIX 
How to Obtain Agricultural Literature. 
Besides the large number of agricultural papers that 
are available for the farmer at very small cost, the De- 
partment of Agriculture issues a large number of inter- 
esting documents, many of which are sent free to any who 
apply for them, while some others may be obtained for 
a small price. 
Write to the Department of Agriculture, Washington, 
D. C., and request a list of the publications issued by the 
Department for free distribution. 
“The Farmers’ Bulletins” are probably the most 
helpful publications issued by the Department of Agri- 
“culture. There are over two hundred issued and the 
number is being increased rapidly. From the list which 
you receive from the Department you may select such as 
interest you and request them sent to you. You may 
write to your Congressman for them or to the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. 
Each year the Department of Agriculture issues a fine 
illustrated ‘Year Book.” This may be obtained free 
by application to the Congressman of your district or to 
either of your United States Senators. 
If you have an Experiment Station in your State, find 
its location and write to the “ Director of Experiment 
Station,” requesting that your name be placed on the 
permanent mailing list to receive all the bulletins issued 
by the station, 
‘You may also request such bulletins as you know to 
have been issued by the Station. They will be sent free 
of cost.

HELPFUL FACTS AND FIGURES 231 
More About Nitrifying Bacteria. 
Crop Rotation.—In chapter nine explanation is given 
of the way that clover and others of the legumes help the 
farmer to enrich the soil. It was there shown that the 
tubercles on the roots of the legumes were the abiding 
places of certain bacteria which, through their activity, 
change the nitrogen of the air into nitrates. The nitrates 
are the most important of the food elements taken in 
through the roots of the plant. All farm crops require 
a large amount of nitrates; hence when the crops are 
removed the soil soon becomes poor because of the loss 
of the nitrates. It is for this reason principally that all 
careful farmers practice crop rotation, using one of the 
legumes in the rotation to supply the nitrates that have 
been removed. 
Pure Cultures of Bacteria.—Careful investigations by. 
the Department of Agriculture and by some of the Ex- 
periment Stations have shown that sometimes the legumes 
will grow without the bacteria forming tubercles on the 
roots, or if the bacteria and the tubercles are present they 
have lost their activity in changing the nitrogen of the 
air into nitrates. When these are the facts, these plants 
are of little or no service in improving the fertility of the 
soil. It has been found, also, that in many places cer- 
tain legumes will not grow well because of the absence 
of nitrifying bacteria. Scientists have now found a 
method of growing bacteria of the proper kind in their 
pure state. These are called “ pure cultures,” and may 
be used for inoculating soil that does not possess them 
or in which they are not active. By growing them on
-P-A-G-E-240
232 i APPENDIX 
substances that have no nitrogen the bacteria are forced 
to obtain their supply from other sources, in this way 
becoming very active in their tendency to obtain nitrogen 
from the air. 
How the Bacteria are Preserved—A pure culture of 
the nitrifying bacteria is made in liquid form. Absorbent 
cotton is placed in this liquid and then removed to dry. 
The bacteria remain on the fibers of the cotton in count- 
less numbers. Of course, they are too small to be seen, 
but they are there and will remain for a considerable 
time without change, much the same as a seed may be 
kept awaiting favorable conditions for germination. 
The Department of Agriculture will, on application, 
send out these pure cultures free to farmers that need 
them for inoculating the soil so that it will produce any 
legume crop. The dry culture sent-out needs only to be 
placed in water to start the bacteria into growth. To 
hasten the growth and to make it more certain, two 
packages of food for the bacteria are sent with the cotton 
culture. 
With the food thus supplied two days gives a growth 
sufficient to change clear water into a milky liquid. Full 
and simple directions accompany these packages, and no 
difficulty need be experienced in preparing the liquid 
cultures. 
Applied to the Soil.—After the liquid culture has 
been prepared it should be applied to the soil. A num- 
ber of methods may be used. It may be sprinkled in its 
liquid state over the field, or a quantity of dry soil may 
be sprinkled with the liquid, and this soil may be scat- 
tered over the field. The most convenient method, how-
-P-A-G-E-241
HELPFUL FACTS AND FIGURES 233 
ever, is to inoculate the seed. The seed that is to be 
planted may be placed in a sack and the whole lowered 
into a tub or a barrel of the liquid culture so that each 
seed is wetted. It is then drained and spread out on a 
clean floor to dry. This does not injure the seed in any 
  Roots of young alfalfa plants, austen nodules. (From Farmers’ Bulletin 
0. 214.) 
way. The bacteria remain on the outside of the seed 
ready to become active on the rootlets when the seed 
germinates. 
Inoculation for Legumes Only.—It is useless to apply 
the inoculating material to any other crop than the
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 APPENDIX 
legumes, or the pod-forming plants. The principal le- 
gumes used on the farms are mammoth and red clover, 
white clover, alsike clover, crimson clover, alfalfa, peas, 
beans, cowpeas, soy beans, and vetches. Corn, wheat, | 
  Roots of red clover, showing nodules. (From Farmers’ Bulletin No. 214.) 
oats, rye, potatoes, and other plants that do not form 
pods for their seeds are not benefited in any way by the 
use of the inoculating material. 
Tf the soil is supplied with nitrifying bacteria and is 
growing healthy crops of legumes, very little is gained 
by soil inoculation. It is well to dig up some of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  HELPFUL FACTS AND FIGURES 235 
roots, however, and observe whether they have the nod- 
ules or tubercles. 
Legumes grown in soils very rich in nitrogen will not 
show tubercles on the roots, even though there be a 
thrifty growth. The legumes are of no particular value 
  Roots of soy bean, showing nodules. (From Farmers’ Bulletin No 214.) 
- on such soils. It would be more economical to grow the 
legumes on the poorer soils and use the soils already rich 
in nitrates for some other crops. 
Transfer of Soils—It is possible to inoculate soils from 
the soil of another field that is growing the legume suc- 
cessfully. Soils from a field growing any particular kind  
-P-A-G-E-244
    236 APPENDIX 
of a legume may be used to inoculate soil of another field 
where it is desired to grow the same kind of plant. The 
. soil from a clover patch would probably have no effect 
on a field which was expected to raise a crop of beans. 
It has been found in many cases, however, that the soil 
from a field of sweet clover will inoculate the soil suc- 
cessfully for a crop of alfalia. 
The transfer of soil from one field to another is not 
only a difficult matter, but it may spread certain plant 
diseases and foul weed seeds. As the Department of 
Agriculture is so generous as to furnish the pure cultures 
free of cost, it is folly to depend on other methods of 
inoculation. 
What May be Expected.—Many people have been led 
to believe that soil inoculation will largely transform the 
methods of agriculture. Such hopes are not well found- 
ed. Careful cultivation, attention to climatic and other 
conditions are just as necessary now as before the method 
of inoculating the soils was discovered. All that can be 
claimed is that a wise use of this aid in the growth of 
legumes will without doubt result in much more suc- 
cessful results in growing the “ nitrogen gatherers,’ and 
will enable the farmer to make a crop rotation that will 
enrich his soil year by year instead of wearing it out. 
More facts concerning this subject may be obtained 
from Farmers’ Bulletin No. 214. This bulletin may be 
obtained without cost by writing to the Department of 
Agriculture, Washington, D, C,

  TO THE READER 
However reluctant one may be to acknowledge the 
fact, it is none the less certain that the task of trying 
to educate everybody, which our public schools are 
engaged in, has proved to be far more difficult than 
the originators of the idea of such a possibility thought 
it would be when they set out upon the undertaking. 
This is a mild way of stating a most important truth. 
Moreover, this truth is steadily forcing its way into 
general recognition among all classes and conditions 
of modern society. : 
All people who are interested in educational affairs 
are thinking about the situation, and are talking about 
it constantly, both in private and in public. 
Every educational meeting, from a local Teachers’ 
Institute to the annual gathering of the National Edu- 
cational Association, now makes this condition of affairs 
the chief subject of its attention, its addresses and dis- 
cussions. 
These facts all prove that the issue of attempting 
to universalize education is just now one of most intense 
interest and importance. It follows that, since the 
whole subject is yet in an unsettled, not to say ferment- 
ing, condition, it is open and ready for the most careful 
study and consideration. 
It is because all these things are so that I have 
written this book, which I hope may help at least a 
little toward the successful solution of the most momen- 
tous problem of the age.

  2 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
There is a certain type of man who is wont to remark,’ 
on occasion: “All babies look alike to me.” Yet the; 
first mother he meets will tell him that what he says is 
based on the most superficial observation, and that he 
“doesn’t know what he is talking about.” q 
All my own observations have forced me to acknowk: 
edge the fact that there is a marked difference in chil 
dren, even at the time of their birth, a difference s0 
pronounced that it is perfectly safe to say that no two; 
of them are exactly alike. And just as soon as these 
bits of infantile humanity begin to show their mental 
efficiencies or inefficiencies, these differences become 
more and more manifest. As infancy advances into 
childhood, childhood into youth, and youth into maturity, 
these primal qualities intensify their distinguishing marks 
‘upon each soul, and brand it as itself and not any other 
in all the world. This is the core of all individuality: 
That is, it is not uniformity, but diversity, that constitutes 
the fundamental element which makes a human being 
what he is. : 
A moment’s thought upon this proposition will re 
sult in the conclusion that the “ wholly normal” individ- 
ual, one who tallies exactly and at all points to uniform 
Specifications made and provided, does not exist, and 
that the “perfectly rounded” child or adult is a myth 
and so cannot be figured with definitely. 
So far as we are ourselves concerned, we each ont 
instinctively feel and positively know that these thing 
are as I have stated them; but the popular theory ré 
garding them is quite the reverse of the way I have pu 
them, so much so as to obscure, almost entirely, tht 
facts in the case. At least this is true, that their sig 
nificance, as they stand related to individual possibilitie
-P-A-G-E-11
“BORN SHORT” 3 
in the affairs of life, is not recognized as it should be 
in the theories and practices for human development 
that prevail to-day. 
Stated in another way, —for I wish to emphasize this 
point from the beginning, we are all aware, in our 
inmost hearts, that we are not equally strong in every 
part of our make-up, and that we were born that way. 
That is, as I have phrased it at the heading of this 
chapter, we all know that we are “born short” some- 
where; that in some spheres in the mental plane we 
do not function as readily as we do in some others. 
We all know this. 
And because we all know this — because I know it, 
and everybody I have ever known or known about or 
have heard of knows it — I feel fully warranted in mak- 
ing the inductive conclusion that everybody in all the 
world is “born short” somewhere. Such shortage may 
be so slight in some individuals as to escape the notice 
of all but the expert, or it may be so much in evidence 
in other cases as to be noticed by everybody at a glance. 
It may vary all the way from a minor idiosyncrasy to 
blank idiocy. But in its manifestations in these two ex- 
‘tremes, and all the way between them, the phenomena 
belong in the same category; they are but quantitative 
exploitations of one and the same psychological con- 
dition. 
These facts, and their complements, which will be 
considered later, form the very “central heart” of the 
possibility of educating everybody. 
To analyze and make a list of such shortages, as they 
appear in all the varieties of humanity that the world 
holds, would be an endless task, and volumes could not 
Contain the record, though it would all be germane to

  the issue I am considering. All I care to do here, hov 
ever, is to note enough of the phenomena to form a 
base for the educational theory I have in mind to standy 
upon, ~ 4q 
Cases in point are as thick as blackberries, whichevetf 
way one looks, if only he has eyes to see; and on] 
as another for all practical purposes. I claim no speci i 
merit for the list I am about to give. But since I mi st 
_ have such data to start with, I submit what follows, 
Most of the cases cited have come under my own per 
sonal observation, and all the others are vouched for by4 
_ the most reliable witnesses. q Here then is my list—the data on which the 
part of my argument is based : — ‘ 
“My attention was first called to the fact that there is 
such a condition as. lack of ability to function in somed 
mental plane—that all human beings are not alike in 
_ What they can do with their minds— when I was little 
more than a child, through my association with two of my youthful mates, one of whom was color-blind andy the other tone-deaf. The first was a neighbor boy wht] could not distinguish red from green, He could pet 
ceive no difference between the color of a red rose andi 
the green foliage of the bush on which it grew. The second was a little girl who could not “rise and fal 
her eight notes” at singing school. She sat near me itf the class, and I suffered the tortures of the lost (for 
have a very keen musical ear) from being compelled 1 
hear her monotone droning through the songs the rest 
of us could sing as they were written. These two casei 
made a great impression upon me, and I have never fort 
gotten them. : :
-P-A-G-E-13
“BORN SHORT” 5 
Later in life, as.a teacher in the public schools, I 
found “ shortages” or “lacks ” cropping out, to a greater 
or less degree, in all the pupils who came under my 
tuition. The phenomena began to show in the first 
year’s work, and there were signs of the same qualities, 
more or less pronounced, in each several pupil, till he or 
she dropped out of school or graduated. 
Thus, I found pupils who required several terms to 
learn to read the simplest lessons. These children were 
not idiots, in the ordinary use of that word, though it 
would not be at variance with what I consider to be the 
truth to say that they were idiotic in spots — on the read- 
ing spot, as it were. I have known of pupils who never 
could learn to read, though they were normally able on 
some other lines. The late Supt. E. A. Gastman, of 
Decatur, Ill, once reported to me the case of a boy of 
twelve in one of his ward schools, who, though he was | 
neither deaf nor dumb, yet never could learn to read 
aloud; though his teacher discovered one day, much to 
her surprise, that the lad could read quite well to him- 
self, and that he was specially fond of reading history, 
in which he was much more than usually proficient for 
one of his years. As this boy appeared among his 
mates, there was nothing in looks or actions to indicate 
this particular shortage; that is, he could talk well 
enough, and would pass for what is called a normal 
child to the casual observer. And yet this is his 
record, 
Granted that this case is exceptional. Indeed it is 
one of the most peculiar I have ever had knowledge of. 
But that does not remove it from a legitimate place in 
the list Iam making up. Nor do I think that this case 
is really as remarkable as it at first seemed to me, and
-P-A-G-E-14
i eet 6 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
may seem to the reader to be. Doubtless there are 
a great many primary teachers in this country who 
could cite cases from their own experiences with pupils 
under their care that would equal or surpass this one in 
strangeness. 
I once had a pupil who could not learn the multipli- 
cation tables, though he was remarkably able in some ~ 
other studies. When he grew to manhood he became 
an inventor and business promoter, in which capacity he 
amassed a fortune. But he never learned the multipli- 
cation tables. I met him when he was a man of wealth, 
at the head of a large manufacturing establishment, and 
asked him if he had learned the multiplication tables 
yet, and he replied: “No! Why should I learn the 
multiplication tables? I can hire girls at six dollars a 
week who can do that work for me! Life is too short 
for me to waste it in trying to master what I have no 
head for!” His remark is worth serious consideration. 
This case is also rare, but there are multitudes of 
teachers in the grades who could duplicate it out of 
their own record books. There is a story, which those . 
who surely ought to know declare to be well founded, 
that no less a personage than Dean Stanley had this 
particular shortage, and that, in the prime of his life, 
he once said, in the presence of a gentleman with whom 
he was doing business: “seven times three are twenty- 
three,” and that he knew no better till his friend cor- 
rected him! 
But I must not continue the list in just this line. 
Time and space would fail me to tell of the pupils I 
have had who were “short” in spelling! (Please don’t 
all exclaim at once!) In lack of ability to memorize dates 
I have had many cases. I myself could never learn 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
“BORN SHORT” 7 
to draw a map, or anything else but my salary. And 
yet I strove hard, with all my might and main indeed, 
to do such work. I was equally a failure in my 
attempts to master Latin and Greek, though I virtually 
sweat blood in trying to obtain a knowledge of these 
languages. I used to sit up till late at night to dig out 
my translations, and was up and at work again in the 
very early morning. But it was a rare thing for me to 
make a recitation on which I could get a record of 7 on 
a scale of marking in which 10 meant correct. The 
men and women are yet living who could testify to the 
truth of these statements. I record them now at this 
time of my life, not with shame or any feeling of dis- 
grace, though in school I was more than once put to a 
mental torture that was akin to crucifixion because of 
my “shortage” on these counts! And I think these 
terrible experiences of my schoolboy days are not nearly 
as exceptional among the pupils of to-day as they ought 
to be. 
If the reader is a teacher, please pause and think a 
moment just here ! 
Any teacher of experience can extend this list of 
“short” pupils ad infinitum. 1 turn, then, from this 
part of the record of children to that of grown-ups. 
Perhaps I ought to explain that these adult cases are 
given for the sake of showing the persistence of “ born 
so” lacks or excesses. It is this fact that makes them 
germane to my chief contention, of vital interest in the 
issue in hand. 
T once knew a school teacher, a good one, too, she was, 
who could not tell the time of day on a watch or clock. I 
mentioned this fact once, at a public educational meeting, 
and at its close a judge of the court in that district, who
-P-A-G-E-16
SS SF 8 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
happened to be present and so heard my remarks, came 
to me and said: “Mr. Smith, I did not suppose that any 
other human being in all this world ever was afflicted as 
I have always been. But the case of the teacher who 
could not tell time is exactly like my own. I have never 
been able to tell the time of day on a watch or clock. 
I carry a watch because that is counted the proper thing 
for a judge to do; but if I want to know, for certain, 
what time it is, I ask some one who knows!” JI after- 
wards inquired of lawyers who practiced before this 
judge’s court, and was told that he always asked some 
one what time it was before he adjourned court. They 
said he would squint at the clock, as if he could not see 
its face clearly, and would then inquire what time it was 
and wait till some one told him! None of the lawyers 
knew positively that the judge could not “tell time,” he 
concealed his defect so cleverly, but one of them said to 
me: “It always seemed curious to us that he could see 
our faces, anyhow well enough to tell us apart, and 
could not see the face of the clock.” 
I know a primary teacher, of national reputation, who 
cannot tell her right hand from her left except by a 
special mental effort and the use of a particular method 
she has for determining which hand is which. I also 
know a leading college president, who is at the head of 
one of the best institutions of its class in this country, 
who is “short” in the same way. 
I know a State Commissioner of Education, who is 
among the foremost of educational leaders in the United 
States, who never writes a letter with his own hand. 
He cannot spell-—- has never been able to learn to do so. 
A leading bishop of one of the strongest denomina- 
tions in this country once said to me: “It would be a
-P-A-G-E-17
“BORN SHORT” 9 
notable day when I would not spell which in at least 
three different ways in writing a single page.” 
In her autobiography Julia Ward Howe states that 
Charles Sumner had so little mathematical ability that 
Professor Pierce, of Harvard College, once said to him: 
“Charles, I never expect to get the simplest mathemati- 
cal proposition whittled down to so fine a point that 
even the tip of it could enter your mind.” 
The late N. S. Shaler, in his autobiography, said, in 
speaking of the examination that Professor Agassiz gave 
him, when he became the pupil of that noted scientist : 
“He did not probe me in my weakest place, mathe- 
matics, for the good reason that, badly off as I was on 
that subject, he was in a worse plight.” 
I know an actress of such wonderful tragic ability 
that she can thrill an audience to the point of frenzy 
(the real thing), and yet she could not “make change 
for a dollar” to save her life. 
Every reader of General Grant’s Memoirs will recall 
the story he tells of his financial “‘ shortage” as shown 
in buying a colt when he was a boy; and the story 
of the Grant-Ward failure shows how his youthful trait 
remained with him to the close of his life. 
Similar cases, showing the general distribution of 
“shortage” among men and women whose names are 
honored throughout the world could easily be given, but 
these are enough to establish all I am contending for 
here. All these and multitudes besides have demon- 
strated that they had a lack of ability to function in 
certain spheres of the mental plane — that they were 
“short” on some counts. It is equally true that these 
“shortages” manifested themselves in the early life of 
the individuals concerned, that they were “ born short”
-P-A-G-E-18
10 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
in each and every case, and that such “shortage” cuta 
considerable figure in their lives and acts, both in their 
youth and in their adult life. This point is so clear that 
I can rest the further presentation of the testimony 
that upholds it right here. The facts I have stated are. 
undeniable, and they all mean something. I shall refer 
to them again and again when I come to argue the case 
in full.

CHAPTER II 
“BORN LONG” 
Partial List of “Longs”— Mathematical Boy of Six— Primary 
Pupils who could “always” read or draw—Case of Robert 
Gardenhire —“ Absolute Pitch” possessed by Boy of Ten— 
Idiot Girl a Crochet Genius — Juvenile Prodigies— The “Pro- 
nounced” ws, the “Exceptional” — General Distribution of the 
Phenomena of “Longage” in Some Form— Found among All 
Classes of People— Author's Ability to memorize Prose and 
Poetry — Similar Cases noted — Examples from Other Walks of 
Life—The Little Engine—The Gardener—The Cook—The 
Significance of these Facts. 
Turninc now to the other side of the shield, I give 
herewith a limited list of people I have known who 
were “long,” or here or there, who had an excess of 
ability to function in certain spheres of the mental 
plane. Here, also, my observations began when I was 
quite young; and while I did not philosophize upon the 
data at that time of my life, yet they made a marked 
impression upon me as peculiar mental phenomena, 
which has continued even to this day. 
I remember a boy of six who was always “making up 
problems” which he delighted to spring upon his elders. 
One, I remember, was as follows: If a quarter of a 
dollar is fifteen sixteenths of an inch in diameter, and 
it is 25,000 miles around the earth, how many quarters 
laid side by side would it take to reach. around the 
world? He would make up and solve “mentally” the 
most intricate problems in interest, and when asked 
how he got the results, he would reply, “At first I 
il
-P-A-G-E-20
12 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
thought it was so much; but when I thought about it 1 | 
knew it was so much.” This was all he could tell 
of how he obtained his results, which were always 
correct. 
Surely a six-year-old boy who could make up and 
mentally solve problems like this might be counted as~ 
having an excess of ability to function in the mathe 
matical plane. He had never been to school when he 4 
did this work, and had had no instruction in arithmetic” 
to amount to anything. 
As a teacher, I had pupils who could not remember 
when they learned to read, they acquired the art so 
early in life. All primary teachers are familiar with 
similar cases. I have had pupils in the lower grades | 
who, unaided, could draw pictures in correct perspec- | 
tive, and who “had always done so.” I have also 
known grade pupils who were walking cyclopedias of 
dates and events, but who did not have to make any | 
special effort to acquire such proficiency. 4 
But I need not multiply instances of this sort in these | 
strata of human life. All teachers of experience are | 
familiar with them, and most parents know something 4 
of them. So, leaving these, I turn to similar phe- | 
nomena in older people. | 
One of the most remarkable cases of this sort that I. 
have ever had personal knowledge of is that of Robert | 
Gardenhire, a full-blooded negro, of Augusta, Ga. I | 
became acquainted with this case through a classmate | 
of mine, a former teacher, and so one well able to judge ‘ 
in the premises, and with his assistance I was enabled | 
to make a thorough examination of the young man and 
to verify the remarkable phenomena his mental func 
tioning exhibited. 3 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
“BORN LONG” 13 
At the time of our examination, this man was about 
twenty years old. He had been to school less than a 
year, all told. He could read and write a little, but was 
“wholly uneducated,” in the ordinary meaning of those 
words, He was working in an oil mill, shoveling cotton 
seed at seventy-five cents a day, and that appeared to 
be as much as he could earn at such work— seemed 
about his limit of value in that direction. In a word, 
he was a very ordinary negro, so far as his general 
ability was concerned. 
When he was about seventeen years old people dis- 
covered that he was “bright in figures,” and began to 
ask him questions. The result was that he soon ac- 
quired local fame, and almost every one he met would 
test his ability, till in a short time he became wonderfully 
expert in solving certain kinds of mathematical prob- 
lems. He was especially strong in multiplication. 
Give him two factors to be taken together, and he would 
promptly give you the correct result. If the factors 
were only “two-placed” numbers, each, he would an- 
nounce the product instantly. If they were “three- 
placed” numbers, he would hesitate just a little before 
replying. The work was all done “mentally,” that is, 
he never wrote the figures down. He could work a little 
with written numbers, but in such work he was very 
slow. This way of working was very distasteful to him. 
He hated it. 
To this unlettered negro my friend dictated thirty- 
three problems in multiplication. The gentleman him- 
self wrote the factors upon a sheet of paper, as he 
announced them, and then immediately set down, after 
each set, seriatim, the answers, as the young man gave 
them to him. In no case was there a delay of more
-P-A-G-E-22

    than a second or two in giving these answers. The list |

I have verified these problems, and find there are 
three mistakes in the answers. (You would smile should | 
I tell how many mistakes I made in my calculations, in | 
doing this proof work! Suppose you try it yourself, | 
and see how you come out!) 1 
And this case, wonderful as it is, is only one of many. 
The similar case of Zerah Colburn has been well know 
to psychologists and professors of pedagogy for many | 
years, and “lightning calculators” are as thick as side] 
shows, the country over. | 
Nor are such cases confined to mathematics alone. q 
They crop out in nearly every other line of life that is 
known to humanity. 
Again, I know a blind boy who has the gift of “ abso 
lute pitch” in music. Strike any key on the piano and: 
he will name the tone produced. Strike as many as you:
-P-A-G-E-23
“BORN LONG” : 15 
will, even if that means every key on the board, and all 
at once, and he will name for you every key you have hit. 
Professor Frank Hall, of Aurora, IIL, brought this case 
to my notice. 
I once met a girl of twelve who had such a poor sense 
of number that she could not count at all, and yet she was 
so skillful with a crochet hook that she could duplicate 
any pattern of crochet work that might be given her. 
She would even take a printed pattern of a piece of lace, 
as it appears in a needlework book or magazine, and 
produce the work perfectly with her hook and thread, 
though wholly unable to count a stitch, or to read a word 
of the printed directions. She also made original pat- 
terns which were of rare beauty. 
I have a record of a boy who was ready to enter college 
at nine years of age.. He read Latin well at five, and a 
little later mastered French and German. He took de- 
light in differential calculus at eight, and was very fond 
of chemistry. The remarkable record made by William 
James Sidis isa similar case that all the world has 
recently been made familiar with. 
I have a young lady friend who was born blind. 
When she was about three years old, a skillful doctor 
removed the cause of her blindness, and she could see. 
As soon as she could use her eyes she began to read. 
She never had to be taught how to read, but read al- 
most everything fluently from the first. Before she 
was five, I put a copy of “Sartor Resartus” into her 
hands one evening, just to see what she could do, and 
she read page after page without a halt. 
But I need not multiply cases of this class. Time 
and space would fail me to tell of Mozart, and Millais, 
and Blind Tom, and Lope de Vega, and Tasso, and
-P-A-G-E-24

   Webster, and hundreds of others, whose names and 
records are well known, and all of whom were notably 
“long” in some lines — were “born so,” and were so as 
long as they lived. 
All these people and their similars are “long” in 
their ability to function in certain spheres of the mental 
plane. 
But, some one says, these cases are nearly all excep- 
tional; they are taken from the unusual walks of life; 
and hence their experience and records are not a fair 
measure to use on the rank and file. To which I reply 
these cases are phenomenal rather than exceptional. 
And I am impressed with the fact that there is no need 
of making even such a concession. For, when I note 
my own ability to function on some mental planes, I find 
myself as pronounced and exceptional as the rest, and 
the same is doubtless true in your own case, whoever 
you are.. And when I look about amongst my neigh- | 
bors, right here at home, I find that every one of them, | 
even the humblest, is about as pronounced and excep- 
tional as you, or I, or any one. 
Thus, not to draw aside the veil of my own personality 
too far, and surely not to boast, I have always been 
“long” in the matter of remembering certain pieces of | 
literature so that I could quote them. This memorizing 
at pleasure has never cost me any effort, nor does it 
do so to this day, provided the selection takes my 
fancy — strikes me right. If it does that, I can master | 
it without trying to do so at all. I can repeat, as I 4 
would my alphabet, the nursery rhymes learned in my , 
infancy; and it is only a few days since I memorized a 4 
poem of sixty-four lines by hearing a public reader recite | 
it a single time before an audience. Pieces memor-
-P-A-G-E-25
“BORN LONG” 17 
ized in that way I retain well, without any particular 
effort. It all depends on “how they strike me.” If 
they “hit me hard,” they stay with me. More than: 
twenty-five years ago I heard Henry Ward Beecher 
deliver a lecture that greatly pleased me, and I could 
write several columns of it to-day, though I have never 
tried to memorize a word of it. This is a power that 
I have always had, from my earliest recollection, this 
ability to memorize certain things without effort. I 
was “born so,” and that is the way I am to this 
day. 
And again some one says “ exceptional.” 
Well, two doors south of where I am writing, I had, 
for years, a neighbor who could discount me in this sort 
of “exception.” He is a dry goods merchant, and a 
successful one too, I remember his coming over to my 
study one evening and quoting the whole of the “ New 
Locksley Hall,” when that poem first came out, after a 
single reading, and I am sure he could quote it to-day, 
with equal ease and accuracy. 
Two doors north of where I am writing lives a woman 
who can quote seven of Shakespeare’s plays, verbatim et 
iteratim, and she never spent an hour in érying to mem- 
orize them. She will also repeat Browning by the thou- 
sands of lines, and is equally able to recite Walt Whitman, 
page after page. She is the wife of a bookkeeper and 
was for years a commercial stenographer. 
And again some one says “exceptional,” and adds: 
“Take some instances from the commoner walks of 
life.” Well, dry goods merchants and commercial 
stenographers are not regularly counted as among the 
intellectual “Four Hundred,” but my experience is that 
this trait of excess of ability to function in some mental 
c
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
plane extends through all the social strata and covers all 
sorts of mental ground. Thus, a street car conductor 
on the line that runs in front of my door has just com- 
pleted a steam engine that is so small that it can be 
entirely covered with a lady’s thimble. He has built it 
at odd times, and “just for fun.” He is not a pro- 
fessional mechanic. 
The man who takes care of my “home place” is of 
Irish extraction, born and reared on the “ East Side” 
in New York City. Until he was sixteen, all the green 
and growing things he had ever seen or knew about 
were such as he saw in the City Hall Park. Yet I never 
met his equal as a gardener. He will coax the finest of 
vegetables, such as would baffle my very best efforts to 
produce, out of a soil and environment that I could get 
little or nothing out of. And yet I grew up on a farm, 
and was taught to do these things, while this man was 
reared on cobblestone pavements, in the region of Five 
Points. He and a weed cannot exist on the same acre, 
and he would sit up nights to nurse a drooping plant to 
vigor again. I would not, and the chances are that the 
plant would die if I did. 
For years we had in our kitchen (I’m surely within 
the range of the common walks of life now) a woman ~ 
who was “long” on cooking. She had had no particular 
training in the art, but she “loved to cook.” This she 
could do to perfection, practically without any special 
effort or application, but because it was the joy of her 
life. She used to say it “just came natural” to her. I 
am sure it did. 
But I need not make this list longer. The truth is, I 
have rarely met a man, woman, or child who was not 
“long” somewhere. And if you, dear reader, will look |
-P-A-G-E-27
“BORN LONG” ‘19 
within and about yourself, you will find that your expe- 
rience and mine are very much alike. The cases you 
have seen and know about are not identical with those 
I have noted, but they exhibit the same principle. And 
that is enough.

Anp now, having given these lists of “shorts” and 
“longs,” having shown that there are such phenomena | 
as lack and excess of ability to function in certain | 
spheres of the mental plane in human experience, I wish | 
to make a few comparisons in the premises and to note | 
some conclusions that are very apt to follow naturally, : 
though I think wrongfully, in cases such as I have] 
noted. 
In the first place, I wish to emphasize the fact that it | 
is a very common conclusion that, if any given person | 
is pronouncedly “short” or “long” zz some particulat | 
fine of ability to function mentally, he or she is als0; 
equally short or long zz all other ways. Such conc: 
sions are especially prominent with all of us when we 
compare other people with ourselves. 
If you, dear reader, are a good mathematician, 
arithmetic was always the delight of your life, an

algebra likewise, and you learn, in some way, that a 
neighbor or an acquaintance of yours can hardly add a 
short column of figures correctly, the chances are many 
to one that your opinion of that neighbor or acquaint- 
ance will be lowered not a little by such discovery. Or, 
if you are a good speller, naturally so, and you get a 
letter from some correspondent in which there are mis- 
spelled words, the probabilities are that you will set the 
writer down as an “ignorant person,” to say the least. 
But if you are “short” on mathematics and come across 
some one else who cannot.add, you do not look down on 
such a one. You sympathize with him — you know just 
how it is yourself. The same is true if you are a poor 
Speller. You are “drawn to” any one in like case. ° 
Again, if you have no “knack ” in some line of work, 
if you are “short” in some particular way, and you come 
across some one who is “handy” or “long” just there, 
the probabilities are that you will be filled with wonder 
and amazement that such person can do what he does 
so easily, and you will be very apt to leap to the con- 
clusion that he can do everything else just as readily! 
Before you read further, please stop, just an instant, 
and think out how these things are in your own particu- 
lar case. Such brief introspection will help you to 
comprehend better all that I say hereafter. 
What I wish to urge is, that all such conclusions, and 
such feelings of disgust or amazement, are wrong, though 
they are as natural as that water should run downhill. 
The sympathetic feelings of like for like are all right, but 
not the others. 
To make this point clear, I am going to make a few 
comparisons from some of the cases I have noted. 
To make one of the most startling comparisons first,
-P-A-G-E-30
22 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE’ PEOPLE 
put the cases of Charles Sumner and Robert Gardenhire | 
side by side. Sumner had no mathematical ability that. 
was worthy the name. Gardenhire could solve, “men 
tally” and instantly, problems that it would have taken | 
Sumner hours to “ figure out,” with the chances that even “ 
then they would be wrong. Judged mathematically, and | 
by that ability alone, the colored man would be ranked | 
as far the mental superior of the statesman. And yet! | 
The point I wish to make is that it would be unfair to 
either party to judge him wholly by his lack or excess, | 
by his “short” or “long” ability. Sumner was little 
more than imbecile, mathematically; but I remember | 
hearing Wendell Phillips, in his lecture on Charles Sum- 
ner, tell how, just after he had graduated from Harvard, © 
he made a trip to London; and though at that time he | 
was only “a briefless lawyer,” yet his fame as one skilled | 
in the knowledge of the law had so preceded him that the . 
Supreme Judges in England invited him to sit with them | 
as they heard cases in court. And when a very unusual | 
case came before these judges, one of them turned to — 
Sumner and asked him if he knew any similar case in | 
point. To whom young Sumner replied: “Your honor, 
in such a volume of your own reports, on such a page 
you will find alike case!” Think of this reply, and then | 
compare it with what Professor Pierce said to Sumner | 
about his mathematical inability ! | 
As a matter of fact, it will be difficult for the reader 
to believe this story which Phillips tells of Sumner. It | 
is so far beyond the experience of the most of us that | 
we can hardly realize that it can be true. But I have | 
no doubt of its truth. On his “long” side Charles | 
Sumner was a most remarkable man. On-his “short” | 
side we like to draw the veil. So do we all like to hide | 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
SOME COMPARISONS AND CONCLUSIONS 23 
our own “short” places! What we ought to do is to 
be fair in both and in all cases. 
In the case of Robert Gardenhire, I have already 
said that he was a person of very ordinary ability, out- 
side his special characteristic of unusual mathematical 
strength. Here is his signature, and it shows that he 
can barely write his name. As a day laborer, in the 
Marti? BG oorclerhire : 
simplest sort of work, he could be only moderately suc- 
cessful. Yet is it not true that “one would naturally 
expect great things ” of one who was so “ mathematically 
bright”? Most assuredly this is so. 
(There is another point, in this particular case, which, 
while not germane just here, I cannot refrain from men- 
tioning as of interest from an evolutionary standpoint, 
and that is, that this young man is a full-blooded negro; 
at least, he shows not a trace of white blood in his phys- 
ical appearance. The puzzling question is, from what 
ancestry did his “longage” come? This is something 
to ponder over !) , 
So much was expected from Zerah Colburn that he 
Was sent across the water to appear before the savants 
of Europe, in the hope that he might reveal something 
entirely new in mathematical methods. But in this he 
entirely failed. He could give no account of how he 
obtained his results, and he was of very limited ability, 
outside his specialty. : 
The little girl I have mentioned, who could work such 
marvels with her crochet hook, was in an idiot asylum, 
though on the line on which she was “long” she could 
do what not one woman in a million could ever learn to 
do. She could not read, and she could not count. And
-P-A-G-E-32
24 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
yet she could crochet an intricate lace pattern from a’ 
picture of the piece. I never saw any other human 
being who could do this without “reading the direc-| 
tions” and “counting the stitches,” as the work was | 
done. But this girl could make the lace without read-| 
ing or counting, though she had never been taught how. | 
She was “born long” on that side. That was the way | 
she was. | 
And everybody knows that Blind Tom was entirely | 
limited in his mentality, outside of his musical accom| 
plishments. Where he was “born long” he never had 
an equal. As a child, he showed signs of his rare 
ability. It was the way he was. But it was useless) 
to try to get much of anything else into him or out of 
- him, to develop him, to any extent, in any other direc- | 
tion than in music. Here, he grew and grew. Here, 
but not elsewhere. 1 
Did you ever stop to think of the significance of the} 
final chapter in the life of General Ulysses S. Grant? 
There is no question but that, as a soldier, he was one, 
of the greatest this world has ever seen. There is n0| 
need of eulogizing him on that score. But outside of 
his military attainments, he was a man of very ordinary | 
ability. As a farmer he was a failure, as a statesman, 
he was mediocre, and as a financier he stood at the 
bottom of the ladder. There is no more pathetic story’ 
in all history than the record of the Grant-Ward failure 
But it is pity and not blame that one feels towards the 
great general as the details of that tragedy become} 
known. It is easy to see now that he was a mere child, 
in the hands of an unscrupulous promoter. If he 
possessed even ordinary financial insight, he would have| 
known, from the start, that nothing but ruin could result    
   
      
      
       
     
       
    
   
    
-P-A-G-E-33
SOME COMPARISONS AND CONCLUSIONS 25 
from the course the firm he was a member of pursued. 
But, on that side, he was so short that he could not see 
that King Lear was right when he said, “ Nothing can 
come from nothing.” He was a great general. He was 
weakness itself as a financier. . 
Or, take some others of the particular cases that I 
have reported. The woman who could not tell time 
was a most successful teacher; and the judge who was 
likewise short was remarkably able in his profession. 
He was one of the best Greek scholars I ever knew, 
and as a logician he was invincible. His decisions while 
upon the bench were almost never reversed, so perfect 
was his grasp of every point in any case he was called 
to pass upon. 
But now, truly, if you were a school director, and a 
teacher should make application to you for a position, 
and you should happen to find out that she could not 
tell time, would not that fact tend to make you reject 
her application; would it not almost force you to con- 
clude that she could not possibly be a good teacher? 
Or, if you had a case in court, would you not hesitate 
to have it come before a judge who had to ask some 
one else when it was time to adjourn? You would be 
far above the average of humanity if you did not brand 
both these people as “ fools.” 
Yet this teacher was not a fool, nor was the judge.a 
fool, nor was Charles Sumner, nor was General Grant, 
nor was Louis Agassiz, or any of the rest. They were 
simply “short”? where others are “long,” and it would 
be entirely unfair and unjust to them to judge them 
from their “short” sides. 
The fact is, we are all both “born long” and “born 
short” on some lines.
-P-A-G-E-34
26 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
And beyond doubt this also is true, that, where one 
is born very “long” on some one line, such a person is: 
quite apt to be very “short” on some other line, and 
vice versa, This is true of all the cases I have just been 
considering in detail. But it is equally true that the, 
great bulk of humanity have, each and all, their “long” 
places and their “short” places, their natural bents of 
mind. 
To emphasize what I have just said, I cannot help 
noting some further details of the cases mentioned. | 
want to make it very plain that people who are very 
“short” in some regards are by no means weak in 
others; and also to prove that they have a right in 
the procession, often in the front rank. 
I wish I could give you the name of the teacher who 
cannot tell her right hand from her left without special 
mental effort. She is a woman who has made a‘n4 
tional reputation in her primary work, and in that line 
she has no superior, anywhere. And so of the college 
president who has a touch of the same shortage 
Should I write his name here, you would recognize it 
at once as that of a man who has been honored by the 
teachers of this country as only a very few men have 
ever been. He worthily stands in the front rank 
among the educational leaders of America. So, to 
of the LL.D. who cannot spell. His name is famous 
on more than one continent. 
Why is it, then, that I must not mention the name 
of the people spoken of in this last paragraph? The 
answer is easy. They are all living, and if their names 
were told it would greatly lower them in the esteem of 
many people who know them. If I were speaking of 
where they are “long,” I might sound their names with

a trumpet, and the chances are that all who heard would 
hasten to conclude that they were “intellectual giants,” 
every one, and in every way. But if I tell of where 
they are “short,” their names must be concealed. I 
shall return to this fact later and note its further sig- 
nificance. Meantime, let the reader note it well, and be 
cautious as to the conclusions he forms from the com- 
parisons he makes when considering the “shortages” 
and “longages” in his fellow men — and in himself!

HE was doubtless a wise and observing man who 
first wrote the words poeta nascitur non fit, which, being 
interpreted, tells us that a poet is born, not made. The 
only criticism one can make on this remark is that it is 
too narrow. It not only does not tell half of the story, 
but it simply mentions a somewhat minor fact which is 
a part of a general law. For the fact is that a// men 
are born and not made! 
So far as I have been able to observe, every one who 
was ever born can do some things much more easily | 
than he can do some other things, and he “always 
could.” Or, to put it the other way about, it is more      to do some other things, and it was “always so.” That | 
is, to every individual there are given, from birth, ce 
tain abilities to function in certain mental planes; from | 
every individual, from birth, there are denied or with | 
held certain abilities to function in certain ment 
planes, and to do the things thereunto related. : 
28
-P-A-G-E-37
NASCITUR NON FIT 29 
Does this proposition seem startling? It surely is 
so. But the issue is not there. It is really irrelevant 
whether it be astounding or commonplace. The only 
question worth while is, what are the facts in the case? 
These established, the next question is what to do, 
these things being as they are? 
Now I am well aware that it is a popular theory, 
especially in this “land of the free,” that any man can 
do anything he undertakes to do whether he “has any 
head” for it or not, if he tries hard enough and keeps 
trying long enough. This idea has been carried so far 
as to elicit the statement that even “ genius is only an 
appetite for hard work.” 
This sentiment may be popular, but the experiences 
of humanity prove to every thoughtful individual that it 
isnot true. Ask yourself if it has proved true in your 
own case. Then look about among your neighbors and 
acquaintances, and see if it has proved true in their 
cases. Never mind about what ‘some one says!” 
The evidences that you and I are aware of are as good 
as any! Consider these well, and then give an honest 
verdict. 
My opinion is that the net result of your observations 
will establish the conclusion in you that, while hard work 
and devotion to business are among the best means in 
the world for securing success; yet, even they will not 
bring that result unless the striver and worker has some 
sort of “head” for what he is trying todo. At least, 
this is true, that, if one has a head for what he is work- 
ing for, his chances for succeeding are many fold better 
than they would otherwise be. Even the admission of 
So much is all that is necessary —is enough to establish 
my point.
-P-A-G-E-38
30 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
Now the fact is that if you will go into any walk of life 
and talk with people who know about the details of that 
especial way of living and doing — what are the require- 
ments for success therein, and who are worthy to be 
reckoned as worth while and at the fore, — you will be 
told by such people who know, that “winners 7 our line 
must be born and not made!” There is not a single 
exception to thisstatement. I have tested it a thousand 
- times, and it always comes out the same way. Try it, 
and my conclusion will be yours. 
And yet, the popular theory is that these things are 
not so. Every successful man knows that in his special 
line of work those who are “the real thing” must be 
born and not made; but he has a theory that the same 
principle does not hold true in other spheres of labor. 
Every: successful doctor, engineer, architect, farmer, 
teacher, stock breeder, brick maker, hotel keeper, 
chicken raiser, rat catcher, musician, cook, sea captain, 
general, preacher, inventor, author, financier, bookseller, 
insurance agent, and so on to the end of the line, up 
or down—all of them who know the details of their 
business and who are successful therein, to a man, will 
say, when speaking of their own line of work: “The 
winners in our line must be born and not made.” 
In investigating these phenomena, I have been sut- 
prised beyond telling to find how far-reaching this prin- 
ciple is. There are lines of life that have seemed to me 
so simple and elementary that any one could master 
their requirements, especially if he tried hard to do so. 
But even here I have found the “born and not made” 
principle positively in evidence. : 
I was talking once with a railroad manager whom I 
overheard telling one of his “traveling engineers” to
-P-A-G-E-39
NASCITUR NON FIT 3t 
look after a certain fireman on his division, and I heard 
him say: “If he can’t learn to do it, you'll have to let 
him go.” And I said: “Can’t learn to do what?” 
To which the manager replied: “To shovel coal inte the 
fire box!” 
“Do you mean to say,” I asked, “that it is possible 
that a man can be found who can’t learn to shovel coal 
into a locomotive furnace ?” 
And this is the answer I got: “Sure! It is only 
about one in four who try to do it that can learn to do it 
right.” And then he added: “A fireman has to be 
born, he can’t be made!” 
Thad no idea that so apparently simple a matter as 
shoveling coal into a fire box demanded initial aptitude 
for such work, and I am quite certain that many who 
tead these lines will pooh-pooh the statement. But if 
they will i inquire of the men who know about such things, 
they will find it is only a plain, unvarnished tale that I 
have unfolded. 
And s0 it is in any line of work that may be named. 
The universal complaint amongst all classes of employers 
is that they cannot find people who have initial ability 
to do the work required of them, (I know a merchant 
who hunted the country over before he found a man who 
Could do up packages to suit him.) It is said that only 
about four in one hundred who enter the mercantile pro- 
fession succeed in that calling. Ask any successful 
merchant why these fail, and he will tell you that they 
have no “head” for such work. The chances are that

Of course, there are many people, probably a large 
majority, who can do more than one thing well. There 
are not a few who are exceedingly versatile. But even 
the best of these have their “short” places; there are 
things they cannot do well, — things they have no initial 
ability to do, and which, if they are wise and are aware 
of their “shortage,” they will not try todo. Think how 
it is with you. 
Under which circumstances, I beg to submit that I 
believe it to be universally true that any individual will 
succeed best in doing work that he has a natural “ head” 
for, that he was “born long” on, that he has initial 
ability to do. On the other hand, no individual can 
successfully compete in any. calling in which he is “born 
short,” is not apt in, has no “knack” in pursuing. All 
of which is only saying that a square peg will not fit and 
fill a round hole as well as a round one will. 
But, it is contended, if the hole is round and the peg is 
square, make the peg round! To which I answer, it all 
depends on the nature of the peg as to how successfully 
this can be done. And I might add that many a good 
square peg has been ruined in trying to make it round, 
and vice versa. The truth is, that, so far as human nature 
is concerned, it is far harder to make a natura! shortage 
long than is generally conceded; especially is it very 
much harder than some teachers.and most professors of 
pedagogy generally will admit. There are reasons for 
this, which will be considered later. 
It is true, of course, that training can do much to in- 
crease efficiency, that culture can augment native power. 
What is not true is the claim that training and culture 
can create, de novo, abilities that are not inborn. Here 
is a fundamental psychological fact whose truth is
-P-A-G-E-41
NASCITUR NON FIT 33 
generally denied in the pedagogical profession... And 
yet, so far as each individual who reads these lines is 
concerned, each one knows that the experiences I have 
stated are true in his or her case. Think, here, of your 
own experiences in this regard. 
I was talking, only last evening, with a very success- 
ful real estate agent of my acquaintance. We were 
speaking of “shorts” and “longs,” and he said: “I 
think I was ‘short’ on grammar. I graduated from 
the high school, but I didn’t know a thing about gram- 
mar then, and I don’t know now. I couldn’t tell a verb 
from a noun now, to save my life. I was a good guesser, 
and I guessed my way through that study, from start to 
finish, so that they passed me, somehow. But I believe 
I could have been made to learn grammar if my teacher 
had gone at me hard enough,” he went on to say, “ and 
T'll tel you why. One evening my teacher made me 
stay after. school to learn the list of pronominal adjec- 
tives. Now I have no more idea what a pronominal 
adjective is than the man in the moon. I hadn’t then, 
and I haven’t now. But there was a game of ball called 
for half-past four that evening, and I had to pitch it, and 
I knew that my teacher meant business and that that list 
of words had to be learned before I could get out. The 
result was that I learned the list in twenty minutes, and 
I can repeat it to this day, though that was thirty years 
ago.” And then he repeated the list to prove his words. 
And I said: “Have you ever niade any use of this 
list of words in the thirty years you have been able to 
repeat them?” 
And he replied: “No, but I learned’em! And if I 
could be made to learn them, why not the rest of the 
grammar?” 
D

Upon which I thought, cud dono ? but I said not a word, 
Silence is sometimes golden. 
Later, this same man told me that, in the hundreds of - 
deeds he had written in connection with his real estate 
business, not once had he ever gone to a record to find 
out the description of any piece of land he was deeding.. 
He said: “ Whenever I handle a piece of land, the first 
thing I do is to get my foot on it, to see just where it is; 
and, after that, I can always remember the description of 
it. In the hundreds of deeds I have written I have never 
looked up a record, and I have never made a mistake.” 
Then I asked him if he thought he could write a 
grammar in a similar way, and with equal accuracy? 
Whereupon he laughed me to scorn, and said: “If I 
should live to the age of Methuselah, and study grammar 
all the time, I don’t think I should ever know enough 
about it to give an intelligent opinion on the subject.” 
I asked him if he thought he could have competed 
successfully as a grammar maker or teacher, and then 
he was silent. There are times when “only silence is 
fully expressive.” 
I have taken space and time to report this case fully, 
because it is so perfect a type of a widely distributed 
feeling and belief amongst multitudes of people. To 
this man it seemed an easy thing to write deeds as he 
did, to remember the exact description of every piece of 
land he had ever handled. He told me he believed I 
could do it, that I surely ought to be able to, since I 
could repeat a poem of sixty-four lines from hearing it 
once! But when I asked him why he did not remem- 
ber poetry as well as he did descriptions of land, he 
replied: “I wasn’t born that way!” 
And I said: “The argument is closed.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-43

This man is a successful real estate agent because 
he can utilize, in that business, his ‘excess of ability to 
function in a mental plane that fits his business per- 
fectly. In such a line of work I should have failed 
ignominiously. I could not, to-day, give a description 
of the piece of land I have lived on, though I have paid 
taxes on it for a quarter of a century, and so have seen a 
written description of it at least once a year for that length 
of time. I was not born to remember data of that sort, 
and no amount of training could fit me to compete in 
the real estate business with a man who has such a 
head for that sort of thing as my friend has. 
Here, then, is my conclusion, namely, that experience 
Proves that it is not wise for any man to base the motive 
of his life work on the theory that he can do one thing 
just as well as he can another, if.he only tries hard 
enough and keeps trying long enough. The sane thing 
to do, in every case, is for each individual to take ac- 
count of his own initial abilities and inabilities, where 
he is “short,” and where he is “ long,” and plan his life 
work accordingly just as far as his environment will 
permit him to do so. 
The fact is, there has been any amount of false teach- 
ing on this point, to the effect that the harder it is for 
one to do any particular thing the more virtue there is 
in doing just that thing, and the greater will be the 
returns to the doer in the way of added strength and 
increased ability. It is true that added strength comes 
from overcoming resistance, to a certain degree; but 
there is a limit to the principle, and that limit is reached 
when the person attempting to overcome such resistance 
has not enough understanding of the situation to attack 
intelligently the forces against which he strives.

There was great sense in the words Mr. Lincoln once 
wrote to a young man who asked him to map out his 
life’s work for him. Lincoln wrote: “An intelligent 
perseverance is the surest guarantee to success in life.” 
That tells the whole story. It is not only essential to 
persevere, bit to do so intelligently. And when a per- 
son is born so short in a given line that he has no intel- 
ligence to bring to bear on the issue, his struggles to 
succeed lead only to disgust and despair. Such a per- 
son simply strikes blindly, and he is just as liable to 
wound himself as he is to break down the barriers he is 
trying to hurl himself against. The pity of it all is 
beyond telling, and we have all seen such cases, time and 
again. Fortunate are we if we have not had many such 
experiences ourselves. Most of us have had them, to a 
greater or less degree. 
So it turns out that the best results will come to any 
individual by having him move out strongly, resolutely, 
in lines of life on which he is “born long,” for which 
he has innate aptitude, where he has an excess of ability 
to function in the particular mental plane involved. 
The world has no use for blunderers; and he who 
tries to run without eyes to see where he is going will 
surely fall into the ditch. The wise thing to do is to 
test one’s vision before beginning the race, and to be 
willing to accept the verdict of such bringing to the 
proof. If that shows you are blind, then do not try 
ways that require eyesight as a requisite for success 
therein. Test ears, hands, voice, everything — find out 
where you are “short” and where “long,” and then 
true your life work by your native ability, just as far as 
it is possible for you to do so.

And so the man who wrote poeta nascitur, non jit 
wrote too small. He should have written Ommnes nas- 
cuntur, non fiunt. (I got a friend who is “long” on 
Latin to universalize this sentence for me, so I think 
it is right, though I cannot say it is, of my own 
knowledge.) 
I shall return to some of the issues involved in this 
chapter, in a later part of this book, but I have said 
enough here to serve present purposes.

HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE? 
Pertinence of this Query — Glass and Copper as Electric Conduc- 
tors — How, not Why, the Issue—A Tentative Hypothesis— 
Mental Functional Ability determined by Bodily Conditions — 
What is the Human Mind?-~The Mind one Thing, and the 
Body another Thing~-The Body a Means through which the 
Mind functions — The Brain a Machine which the Mind uses— 
An Analogy— Musician and Piano— Mind and Body — The 
Nervous System and other Bodily Organs — Relative Value of

PERHAPS some of my pragmatic readers may remark 
as they note the heading of this chapter: “ Never mind 
how it is that these things are. If they are, they are, 
and that settles it. What is the use of speculating as to 
the modus operandi in the premises ?” 
To which I reply that a study into the way things 
work has resulted in great good in this world. It is 
true that no one ever has, or ever can arrive at the 
absolute ultimate cause of any phenomenon, physical or 
otherwise. No one can tell why it is that copper is 4 
good medium for conducting a current of electricity while 
glass is not. Yet a knowledge of these facts is really 
worth while, and to ignore them is worse than folly. 
One would hardly sin should he say that any man is4 
fool who should attempt to force an electric current 
through glass, or who should try to insulate himself 
with a casing of copper! 
If we can find out how things are, how the forces , 
that do things work, there is a possibility of our com’.

-P-A-G-E-47
HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE? 39 
trolling the action of such forces, in a measure, at least, 
and of utilizing for good what might otherwise be harm- 
ful or fatal. Franklin’s fundamental discoveries as to 
how lightning behaved have led to great results. No 
one has ever found out wy lightning does as it does, 
but the knowledge of how it does is of value. 
It is not impossible that a speculation regarding the 
phenomena of “shorts” and “longs,” as exhibited in 
humanity, may also lead towards something worth 
while. It is for such reason that I present this and the 
immediately following chapters. In doing so, I am not 
claiming that I ama second Franklin. All I am anx- 
ious to do is to seek for the truth as Franklin sought 
for the truth. 
Now, I am not much given to speculation, and yet, 
asthe years have gone on, and as I have observed so 
many hundreds of these “long” and “short” cases, I 
have been forced to formulate some theory as to the 
how and wherefore of these widespread phenomena. 
And while, frankly, I have not as yet arrived at any 
positive conclusion in the premises, yet I have a ten- 
tative hypothesis which I am going to set down here, 
with the hope that the reader will help to verify or to 
disprove it. 
In a word, then, I am very strongly inclined to the 
belief that these wide variations in individual make-up 
are, for the most part, at least to an extent far beyond 
what has generally been supposed, seated in the body 
—that they are the result, in most cases, if not in every 
one of them, of body differences, and not of ultimate 
mental differences, in the individuals in which they 
manifest themselves. I am not yet prepared to say, 
Positively, that this is so; but I do say, quite emphati-
-P-A-G-E-48
40 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
cally, that I very strongly suspect it is so, and that the 
longer I live, and the more generally and closely I ob- 
serve the phenomena involved, the more I am confirmed 
in the correctness of my surmise. Some of my reasons 
for so thinking are as follows : ~ 
Of course, the whole issue turns on the basic question 
as to what the human mind really is, and this is not an 
easy thing to find out. The wisest men of all the ages 
have had their theories about it, and they have differed 
on this point as far as the poles are sundered. I have 
neither the time, space, strength, nor patience to attempt 
here any resumé of what all these have thought, written, 
and said; still less do I flatter myself that I am wiser 
than any one or all of these; or that I can make as 
clear as daylight that which so many before my time 
have only succeeded in making cloudy. But I have a 
few ideas to submit for you to think about, and to have 
you bring to the proof, to the best of your ability. For, 
as has been well said, “‘a theory, to be of any account, 
must tally with the amplitude of the whole earth”; 
and you and I and the facts that we can present area 
part of that amplitude. 
In the first place, then, my own experience with my- 
self (and that is a good place for us all to begin) and 
my observations of my fellow men lead me to believe 
that the body is one thing and that the mind is another, 
and a wholly different thing. How do you feel about 
that, dear reader? How does it tally with your own 
experience in the premises? I don’t care even to ask 
how it tallies with what you may have been taught, or 
have learned from books, or have been led to think, 
from any other source than your own ultimate self. All 
Iam anxious about is, how it squares with your own 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE? at 
experiences and observation. Settle that, and then we 
will move on. 
I, personally, am fully convinced that the body and 
the mind are not one and the:same thing. They are 
different things, and each plays its separate part in the 
phenomena in question. To me, the body is merely a 
means through which the mind expresses itself in time 
and space. It is a machine which the mind energizes 
and causes to act. It is a medium through which the 
mind functions; and the lack or excess of ability of the 
mind to function in any given plane depends upon the 
perfection of the medium as a means of transmitting 
the mind force in that particular field. 
I am not a materialist. I do not even believe that 
“the liver secretes bile”; much less do I believe that 
“the brain secretes thought.” I would rather say that 
the brain is the means through which the mind makes 
thought manifest, just as the liver is the organ through 
which bile ig made manifest. In either case it is a 
force other than the organ itself which functions through 
the organ, or causes the organ to function. 
The best guess that I can make about the combina- 
tion is, that the thinker, — the mind, the ego, or what- 
ever else you may choose to call it, — that which is the 
teal self, that this is the power behind the throne, 
as it were, and so is the ultimate cause of all those 
Manifestations that come to the surface through the 
human body. These things make me believe that the 
body is only the machine through which the mind acts. 
Itis the medium by means of which the ego can express 
itself in time and space. 
I know that analogy is a dangerous guide to go by, 
but I use one here at a venture, not for the sake of
-P-A-G-E-50
42 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
trying to force a point, nor insisting that it is wholly 
conclusive, but in the hope of more clearly illustrating, 
perhaps, what I am trying to say. 
A musician and a piano are not one and the same 
thing. Each uses the other, each is of value to the 
other. But the piano is only the machine through 
which the musician expresses himself, — makes himself, 
his art, manifest in time and space. There is no music 
in the piano, per se. The music is all in the musician 
who sits at the instrument. 
But, no matter how good the musician who sits at 
the piano may be, if the instrument be imperfect or 
unstrung, he can get no music out of it. You may 
say, “turn your figure around, and then see what 
comes of it; namely, no matter how good the piano 
may be, if the player is a fool he will make no music.” 
You have a right to ask me to turn the figure around, 
and I will do so. But first, let me take it my way, 
for a while. I will consider it the other way around 
later on. 
I have come, then, to think of the mind and the 
body as related to each other something after the 
manner of the musician and the piano. The mind 
plays upon the body, uses it, makes itself manifest 
through it. And, just as the strings and keys of the 
piano are nearest in touch to the musician, are the parts 
of the machine that he is most in contact with, so the 
brain and the nervous system of the body are nearest 
to the mind, and most directly connected with it. It is 
through these physical organs that the mind acts, All 
the other parts of the piano sustain the strings and the 
keys, and make them available for their especial work. 
All the other parts of the body sustain the brain and
-P-A-G-E-51
HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE? 43 
the nervous system, and make them available for their 
especial work. . 
I do not wish to carry the analogy too far, but I be- 
lieve that it can be pushed safely one point farther.. For 
instance, some of the comparatively less essential parts 
of the piano may be in bad shape, or altogether wanting, 
and still the piano may be made to discourse fairly good 
music. A leg may be broken, or the cover cracked, or 
the ivory from a key altogether gone, and still the 
essentials of the instrument may not be much affected. 
But if the peg, or hammer of a key be wanting; or, 
Worse than this, if a string be run down or broken— 
then there can be no music gotten from that piano, so 
far as that key or that string is concerned. You may 
use other keys and other strings, on this same instru- 
ment, and get as beautiful tones as ever came from a 
musical machine; but as soon as you touch the broken 
key, or the untuned string, you get only discord, or no 
Tesponse whatever for your stimulative effort, which, 
under right conditions in the instrument, would produce 
harmony, 
Good people, so far as my own experience goes, and 
so far as my observation among my fellow men extends, 
the analogy holds good, so good that I feel almost as 
though there could be little need of saying anything 
further upon the subject. To me it seems clear that 
this relation between the musician and the piano is al- 
Most perfectly typical of that which exists between the 
Mind and the body. And yet, to make myself thor- 
Oughly understood, I shall have to go somewhat more 
into detail in considering the human side of the com- 
Parison. 
In the first place, it is now a well-known fact that
-P-A-G-E-52
44 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
the brain and the nervous system of the body are the 
especial organs through which the mind more immedi- 
ately acts. This is particularly true of the brain, and to 
a large extent of the nervous system. More than this, 
the most recent discoveries regarding the functions of 
the brain have proved that certain parts of this organism 
are especially related to, or have specially to do with 
the reception and translation of stimulative forces that 
affect the body from without. That is, there is a cer- 
tain part of the brain that has to do with the sense of 
hearing, another with the sense of sight, another with _ 
the taste, another with smell, and so forth. If you 
remove one of these special parts of the brain (and such 
often have been removed, or made ineffective by acci- 
dent, or knife, or disease), it is no longer possible for the 
sensation which that part of the brain has to do with 
to be experienced at all. Thus, if the part of the brain 
which has to do with sight is removed, or rendered 
inoperative in a given individual, it is no longer possible 
to see. No matter how perfect the eye of that person 
may be, he cannot see. And so of any part of the brain 
having to do with the other bodily sensations. If any 
part is wanting, or imperfect, it is impossible for normal 
results to be obtained for the individual, wherever these 
faulty places appear. 
Further, not only may imperfect results come from 
bad brain conditions, but the same unfortunate experi 
ences may arise from the failure of the nerves and 
nerve centers to do their appointed tasks. Thus, 2 
nerve may be diseased, or paralyzed, or its proper blood 
supply interfered with, so that it cannot work normally, 
and under such conditions it is impossible for the indi- 
vidual suffering from such malady to do what could
-P-A-G-E-53
HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE? 48 
easily be done but for these obstructions. If, in a given 
case, the nerves of the eye are in bad condition, the 
person who tries to use the eye cannot do so success- 
fully; his sight will be more or less affected, according 
to the degree of the imperfection in the nerve system 
involved. No matter how perfect the eye itself may be, 
if the nerves are imperfect there can be no clear sight. 
The whole body will be full of darkness. And so of 
any other organ; if its nerves are bad, it is impossible 
for it to do what it could do under normal conditions. 
Or, go a step farther. If other parts of the body, — 
the bones or the muscles which support the nerves and 
brain, —if these be imperfect, or interfered with to a 
sufficient degree, such disturbance will affect the nor- 
mal working of the mind through its medium. If the 
skull be crushed, the brain is made inoperative. If the 
Muscles that make the heart beat should be. cut, or 
made powerless in any way, it is needless to say that 
the effect of such physical injury would be at once 
tmanifest in the mental functioning power of the person 
suffering from such a cause. Of course both these 
illustrations are at the extreme of possibilities in their 
Tespective directions; but I have purposely chosen them, 
so that there could be no chance for doubt or question 
in the premises. No one will dispute that a person 
with a broken head or a still heart will be unable to do 
very much clear and definite thinking. And that is the 
point I.am after just now. I take it that so much is 
settled. 
But now note that all the organs that I have men- 
tioned —the brain, the nerves, the bones, the muscles, 
etc.—are all of the body. They all correspond to the 
various parts of the piano — the strings, keys, sounding
-P-A-G-E-54
46 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
board, framework of the instrument, etc. My point is 
that, just as, when some essential part of a piano is 
imperfect, or what it should not be, or altogether want- 
ing, it is impossible for the musician to get good music 
from the instrument; just so, when some essential part 
of the human body is imperfect, or what it should not 
be, or altogether wanting, it is impossible for the mind 
to get good mental results through such a body. 
Having said which, my readers may ask: “Yes, but 
how does it happen that we have imperfect bodies to 
begin with? Why are bodies brought into this world 
only partly made up?” 
And the only answer I can make to such a legitimate 
question is that I don’t know! Neither do I know of 
any one who does know! As I have said at the begin- 
ning of this chapter, there are limits to human knowl- 
edge, and a veil of mystery always closes down beyond 
the limits of finite vision. True, this obscure and tai 
talizing barrier has been cleared away by modern sci- 
entific research at many points that were once counted 
as impenetrable; and the enthusiastic labors of those 
who are now engaged upon the problem of eugenics 
give promise of doing something towards helping hu- 
manity to be better bodied from the outset some time. 
Let us hope that this may be the outcome of such 
endeavors. 
Meantime, it is only fair to say that, so far as this 
treatise is concerned, all this “related matter” is “an- 
other story,” as Mr. Kipling says; and, being so, it is 
beyond the province of the issue Iam discussing to 
consider it at all. 
I would begin and go forward from the point where 
the eugenic researcher begins and goes backward. He
-P-A-G-E-55
HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE? 47 
strives to discover how bodies may be made better be- 
fore they come into this world. I would try to find the 
best ways of handling such bodies as we now have in 
stock, at this present now, so as to get the best results 
for those who inhabit them, through the already fur- 
nished physical media for mental functioning. The two 
problems are entirely distinct, and they must be worked 
out each in its own way. 
My theory is that bodily conditions, especially such 
as obtain at birth, greatly modify, limit, and determine 
mental functionings. I have already given some proofs 
to substantiate this position; but more evidence, espe- 
cially on certain points, is needed to carry the argument 
to the point of positive conviction. I believe that I 
have such evidence in hand, plenty of it, and shall pro- 
duce it in the following chapters. Then I shall proceed 
to consider what such facts and conditions as I have 
established have to do with our attempts to educate all 
the children of all the people.

Localization of Functional Parts of the Brain —The Emotions—

periments upon Insane Women. 
WE can now safely take the next step in this study, 
namely, that not only is it true that certain definite parts 
of the brain have specially to do with receiving and 
transmitting the bodily sensations of hearing, sight, taste, 
and the rest, as noted in the last chapter, but that it is 
probably equally true that the same conditions exist with 
regard to the subtler phenomena that have to do more 
particularly with the mind itself — the emotions and all 
the higher forms of mental expression. Thus, it is now 
a thoroughly established fact that a certain part of the 
brain has specially to do with the faculty of speech; 
or, perhaps better, that speech is given expression 
through the use of a certain part of the brain. If this 
part of the brain be injured or diseased, the faculty of 
speech will be affected to a greater or less degree 
thereby. If it be entirely removed or paralyzed, speech 
becomes utterly impossible. And it has be-n demon- 
strated that such a part of the brain can be removed, 
and still the patient may live. 
It is impossible to go as fully into details on this part

of my theme as its importance really demands and as I 
should be glad to do if space permitted. There are 
volumes to be written on this branch of the subject 
alone. Several such have already been written, and 
more are coming, all the time. There are undis- 
covered countries, and unmapped régions, right here, 
that it is to be hoped will be found out and exploited in 
the not distant future. But the illustration just given 
puts us on the track of what we are pursuing. 
Entering a higher and still more subtle field of mental 
activity, it has now become a very general conviction 
among psychologists that there are parts of the brain 
that have to do especially with memory, particularly 
with some phases of memory. These convictions are 
based upon well-established cases of people who have 
suffered complete loss of memory, or of some particular « 
Memories, as the result of injury or disease of the — 
brain. Such cases are not uncommon; and often, 
where there has been such loss or eclipse of memory for 
4 time, it has been made good again upon the restora- 
tion of the affected parts of the brain to normal con- 
ditions, . 
Reasoning on the inductive basis from the facts just 
Tecited, it is surely a most natural inference that still 
Other parts of the brain have to do with yet higher 
mental functionings —the feelings, the emotions, the 
Spiritual sensibilities, and all the more subtle activities 
of the mind. For here, also, brain injury has often 
Tesulted in a change of mental expression in these 
Particulars, It is a matter of common knowledge that 
hope has been stimulated or depressed, jealousy aroused, 
despair produced, devotion or worship incited or in- 
hibited, and so following, by some physical change

made in some part or parts of the brain. Certainly 
this is true, that there must be cerebral action in con 
nection with these mental activities or we should not be 
conscious of them; and while the brain centers which 
have to do particularly with such phenomena have not 
as yet been definitely localized, the presumption is all in 
favor of their existence. Just as the atom and the 
electron have never yet been seen by human eye, but 
their reality can nevertheless be safely predicated; so 
the fact of the control of all mental expression. by cer- 
tain parts of the brain, all in due order, may, with equal 
saneness, be at least inferred. 
Anyhow, I am so well convinced of the probability 
of the truth of this theory that I have based a mental 
hypothesis upon it; and the more generally I have 
observed the phenomena that this supposition is set to 
explain, the more I am convinced that my position is 
solid and sound. 
Now, with this theory as a basis, namely, that the 
ability to function mentally is largely determined by 
bodily conditions, in particular those that the thinker 
has been born with, it follows, first, that we have no usé 
for the word “feeble-minded.” It isa misnomer. Mind 
is never feeble; but bodies are poor, or half made up, 
or sometimes almost altogether bad. The word “idiot” 
is a good word, in its original sense. It is the Greek 
word for “peculiar”; and, as, primarily applied to # 
human being, meant a peculiar person, and that was all. 
And the fact is, we are a// more or less— peculiar. 
It seems to me this way: The ego, the ultimate self 
in each one of us—in you, whoever you are, in me, in 
any and all, I leave out none—this ego is absolutely 
limitless. I believe that in you, whoever you are, i
-P-A-G-E-59
SOME CASES IN POINT 5r 
your ultimate self, there are limitless powers and abili- 
ties, latent but none the less real, ready and waiting to 
express themselves, if only the bodily organs are suffi- 
ciently perfect to permit of their functioning through 
them. But— 
While all these qualities and powers are resident in 
every human mind and are a part of it, yet it by no 
means follows that they can all be expressed by each 
and every individual who possesses them. On the 
contrary, only such of them can find expression, in any 
given individual, as the brain, the nervous organism, 
and the other physical apparatus render possible in 
that particular person. There is the sum and substance 
of the whole issue, to the utmost limit. 
Because, you see, whatever may be true regarding 
the freedom of the abstract, or the ultimate human 
nind, this is certain and sure: That, conditioned in the 
human body, that mind is limited in its expression by the 
body in which it lives. It can only function in such 
Mental planes as the physical organs through which it 
Must act render possible. Drive a good stake there, 
and you can safely tie to it, I am very sure. 
If you have no eyes, you cannot see. But the ability 
to see, if you had eyes—that is an inherent power that 
You possess, and that you cannot be robbed of. If you 
cannot see, the fault lies in your body. At least, that is 
the way it seems to me. 
Take the case of the girl mentioned, who was born 
blind. For the first few years of her life she was wholly 
unable to see, not because she was not possessed of the 
innate ability to see, but because the physical organ of 
Sight was imperfect in her case. A skillful physician 
Yemedied this defect, and just as soon as her eye was
-P-A-G-E-60
52 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
made single, her whole body, was made full of light. 
Does it not seem clear, in this case at least, that she 
had the ability to see, from the first, and that the only 
reason why she could not exercise that ability was be 
cause an imperfection in her body interposed a barrier 
which this ability could not pass? 
In further considering this phase of my theory I shall 
not confine myself to “born so” cases, but shall extend 
my observations to the variations in mental phenomena 
and inability to function mentally that appear when 
bodily changes come to, or are made in, adults. All 
these cases are germane, in that they all tend to establish 
the truth of my main contention, that “these things are 
in the body.” This is my reason for extending the 
field of my observations into the adult realm. 
Thus, to begin at home, as I sit here writing I have 
a pair of glasses astride my nose. I have to have them, 
or I cannot see the marks I make on the paper under 
my hand. But now, why is it that I cannot see without 
the glasses, and can see with them? Have I myself, in 
my inmost essential being —have I lost the ability to 
see when these glasses are in their case? Not at all. 
I have as much ability to see now as I ever had, prob- 
ably more. But these eyes of mine have been so much 
used that they are getting worn out and have to be 
repaired, artificially reénforced, or I cannot see. The 
trouble is in my eyes, not in me at all. And so it is 
wrong to say I can no longer see well. That is not the 
way to put it. I should say that my eyes have s0 
changed that I can no longer use them, that I cannot 
function through them, that they fail to convey to me 
true sensations of what they once correctly reported, It 
isa physical organ, and not a mental lack, that is at fault.
-P-A-G-E-61
SOME CASES IN POINT 53 
And sometimes eyes are, from the first, much worse 
than mine are now. Sometimes they are altogether 
. wanting. But the ability to use eyes, when they and 
their physical belongings are all present and in good 
working order, is never wanting in a human being. 
You take down the receiver of the telephone some 
morning and put it to your ear, and you get no response. 
What is wrong? Has electricity ceased to be, and has 
magnetism lost the power of attraction? Not at all. 
These forces are as potent as they ever have been, or as 
they ever will be; but there is something wrong with 
the instrument through which they are set to work, in 
this given case. There is a bad connection—a break, 
a crossed wire somewhere. The current cannot function 
through the medium as at present adjusted. That is 
all. Put the instrument right, and your telephone will 
Work as perfectly as ever again. 
So in a case of adult insanity. Here is a person who 
has been rational for years, but one day he becomes 
insane. What is the matter? Is there anything wrong 
with his mind? Not at all. The man himself, the es- 
sential mind of the man, is all right; but something has 
happened to the body through which the man has to 
make himself manifest. The nervous wires are crossed 
Somewhere, or a brain connection is broken, and the 
Mind force can no longer come through. If these 
breaks could be mended, the man would be sane again; 
he would “come to himself” once more. 
To any one who has studied the phenomena of in- 
sanity, it seems to me there can be no doubt that this 
Malady is seated wholly in the body. I knew a woman 
who was hopelessly insane for twelve years. At the 
birth of her second child she had puerperal fever, and
-P-A-G-E-62
54 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
this resulted in insanity. For twelve years she was in 
an asylum, and for a considerable portion of that time 
she was a raving maniac. By a change in the manage 
ment of the hospital a new physician was placed in 
charge of her case, and his diagnosis was to the effect 
that her trouble all lay in some abnormal condition of 
the reproductive organs. Pursuant to this theory, he 
caused the patient to be submitted to a surgical oper 
tion, out of which she came sane, and she has remained 
sane ever since, a period of some fifteen years. 
Can anything be clearer than that, in this case, the 
whole trouble was seated in the body? Here was 4 
woman who had been sane, who had a “ brilliant mind," 
as the phrase goes, and who had been able to use it 
satisfactorily till she was twenty-five years old. Thet 
she became insane, and for twelve years she was. wholly 
unable to use her mind in any normal way. Then came 
a bodily change, caused by a surgeon’s knife. As soo 
as the woman came out from under the influence of 
the chloroform which rendered her unconscious during 
the operation, she was as sane as she ever was. Do 
you think a case like this proves nothing? It seems t0 
me it proves something. At least it is wonderfully sug 
gestive, so far as my theory is concerned. 
Of course this case just quoted is by no means a 
isolated one, as all who are familiar with the subject af 
weil aware. I must not dwell on this phase of tht 
subject too long, but I must push it a little further. 
There lies before me an essay on this exceedingly 
suggestive theme, prepared by the late Dr. R. M. Bucks 
who was for years in charge of the Insane Asylum# 
London, Ontario, Canada. This essay is entitled, “Re 
sults of Two Hundred Surgical Operations on Insané
-P-A-G-E-63
SOME CASES IN POINT . 55 
Women.” It was originally published in the Medical 
News for August, 1900. Dr. Bucke was one of the 
pioneers in physiological psychology, as especially re 
lated to insanity, and his essay is a wonderful record of 
his achievements in that line. I cannot give even a 
résumé of the essay here, but 1 commend it to any and 
all who are interested in that subject. In brief, he tells, 
in this essay, how eighty-three out of these two hun- 
dred women recovered from their insanity after under- 
going a surgical operation at his hands. Is not that 
something in point? Do not facts like these lead us.at 
least very strongly to surmise that what we have been 
accustomed to call mental troubles are, as a matter of 
fact, really caused by bodily ills? Do they not tend to 
Prove that it is a bad condition of the instrument, and 
Rot the musician’s fault, that there are discords jin the 
musical world ? 
Another very significant fact brought out by Dr. 
Bucke’s essay is this: that where the trouble lay in the 
diseased condition of some exceedingly vital and highly 
Sensitive organ, which was intimately associated with 
the mental and spiritual life of the patient, and this ill 
could be remedied, then, in such case, the chances of 
Tecovery of sanity were much greater than when some 
gtosser, less vital, and less sensitive organ was involved. 
That is to say, if the trouble in a piano lies in a string, 
or key, and these can be put right, the chances of get- 
ting good music from the instrument because of such 
Tectification are much greater than they would be if the 
source of the evil was located in some grosser part of 
the combination, and this should be more or less suc- 
cessfully repaired. The analogy may not be perfect, 
but it is at least suggestive.
-P-A-G-E-64
56 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
And this last stated fact from Dr. Bucke’s essay leads 
me to conclude that the more highly sensitive the bodily 
organ may be whose abnormal condition causes insanity, 
in any given case, the greater the probability of recovery 
if the organ can be put right. All of which means that 
if surgery of the brain and higher nervous system can 
be wrought out as successfully as this same art has 
been developed in dealing with other parts of the body, 
much may be hoped for in the recovery of insane people, 
from this source. Indeed, great strides have already 
been made in this same direction, as there is ample tes- 
timony to prove. It is but recently that a case of in- 
sane jealousy that ran to the extreme of attempted 
murder was entirely cured by the removal of a tumor 
that was pressing upon the brain of the patient. There 
are many other cases on record, of a similar nature, 
where some brain trouble has been set right, and the 
patient who was insane was thereby restored to sanity. 
This field is comparatively new, as yet, but it is exceed- 
ingly interesting and suggestive, and the discoveries 
thus far made all tend to establish the truth of the 
theory that insanity is primarily caused by bad bodily 
conditions, rather than by direct trouble in the mind 
itself. . 
This is not an essay on insanity, but I bring this 
phase of the subject in, just here, because it seems to 
me to point directly towards the truth of the theory 
that the varied expressions of individuality in humanity” 
arise from bodily conditions; that the inharmonious 
conditions of human life result from imperfect instr 
ments, rather than from mental disturbance, as such. 
The case is not yet fully proved, but there are a great 
many things that point towards such conclusion. Thes¢
-P-A-G-E-65
SOME CASES IN POINT : 57 
adult cases cited all tend to prove that my theory holds 
good in congenital cases as well. All the difference 
is that in one set of cases the hampering bodily condi- 
tions came before birth, in the other after that event 
The cause is the same always.

Tus may be getting into pretty deep water for the 
lay reader, but I am going a little farther along the 
way I have been traveling for the last two chapters, at 2 
venture. 
The late Dr. F. W. H. Myers, of London, England, 
who was for years a leader among the mental philoso 
phers and psychologists of Europe, gave to the world 
the phrase “the subliminal self,” which, being inter 
preted, means the self that is under the threshold, or, 
below the plane of one’s normal consciousness. His 
idea was that there is a great part of one’s real self that 
never, or, at best, but seldom, or in spots, as it were 
ever rises into the realm of our conscious being. He 
made a special study of what he held to be this veritable 
part of every man’s mental make-up, as it manifests it 
self in dreams, visions, hypnotic phenomena, trance col 
ditions, and the like. The theory he promulgated has 
since been largely exploited in the line of suggestive 
therapeutics and mental healing. I wish to direct attet- 
tion to it in some other realms of human life, especially 
58
-P-A-G-E-67
UNDER THE THRESHOLD 59 
such as have to do with the subject I have in hand, 
namely, education. 
Dr. Myers’ idea was that all these mental phenomena 
are produced by an up-rush, so to speak, of the sub- 
liminal self, which, for good and sufficient reasons, 
that cannot be stated here for lack of space, rises into 
the realm of normal consciousness. Once in that plane, 
sometimes we can cut under what has appeared from 
below, and so retain in the normal memory a record of 
what has come to us in this way. Thus, according to 
this theory, a dream is only the working out of the part 
of one’s self that is usually below the threshold of 
normal consciousness, but that, for the time being, wells 
up above that line. : 
Weare more or less conscious of what this part of our- 
selves does, in any given case, in proportion as we have 
more or less definite recognition of any particular dream. 
Sometimes this up-rush is so pronounced that it leaves 
a strong impression upon the consciousness, so strong 
that it will remain in the memory, and in such cases we 
can tell, on waking, what our dream was. But if the 
issue from below is less strong, we only remember that 
we have dreamed. His theory is exceedingly interest- 
ing, and he has recorded great numbers of instances to 
substantiate his position. If you are interested in this 
sort of thing, get and read his great work on “Human 
Personality.” 
Now it seems to me that, in large degree, this theory 
of Dr. Myers’ makes for the hypothesis I have espoused. 
In any event, it has led me to make some educational 
speculations. And here is the possibility that has sug- 
Rested itself to me: — 
Experience leads me to believe that it is highly prob-
-P-A-G-E-68
60 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
able, to say the least, that this subliminal conscious 
ness of ours, which Dr. Myers holds to be by far the 
greater part of our ultimate selves, of everybody’s ulti- 
mate self, exists in measureless supply in each one of 
us; and that it is unceasingly striving for expression in 
time and space through the medium of the body —“ the 
round of flesh that walls us in,” as Browning has it 
Here, in a given case, it acts upon a mechanism of the 
body that is suited to its needs, and so can come 
through. There, in the same body, it comes up against 
an impassable barrier, in the shape of an imperfect or 
altogether wanting physical organism, and so has n0 
means of making itself manifest. This occurs to me a 
being at least possible (and I think a good deal morte 
than that), and for some years I have been observing 
mental phenomena and trying to make out how nearly 
this theory will account for them; And the more I 
observe and ponder, the more I am inclined to believe 
that this theory is headed in the right direction. 
For instance, to recur again to the case of the girl who 
was born blind. This child had, from the first, the 
innate ability to see, this being a constituent part of het 
essential self. But as that power strove to exercis¢ 
itself, through her body, as it was at her birth, it came up 
against an impassable barrier’ in the shape of imperfect 
eye nerves. The result was that that part of herself 
which would normally gain expression through sight 
was made of none effect, and was, as it were, blotted 
out of existence. This case is a very simple one, but it 
stands for a great deal. 
This same theory holds good in the cases of insanity 
that I have noted. The fact seems to be that these. 
people were no longer able to “ come through,” becaus?
-P-A-G-E-69
UNDER THE THRESHOLD 6r 
of some physical imperfection in their bodies that their 
minds could not overcome. It also accounts for such 
phenomena as Robert Gardenhire exhibited. In his 
case, the physical organism that has to do with the 
expression of the mathematical part of himself is prob- 
ably in a most perfect condition ; and so, on that side, 
his subliminal mathematical self can come through 
without let or hindrance. In the case of Charles 
Sumner, the probabilities are that this condition was 
reversed, and the result was that he was able to func- 
tion but very little on the mathematical side, though it 
would seem, to the ordinary observer, that he had as 
much—yes, far more—innate mathematical ability. than 
had this unlettered negro. Does it not look that way? 
I believe that the fact was that Mr. Sumner’s brain was 
faulty in the part that has to do with mathematical ex- 
Pression, and so he could not come through there, to 
any considerable degree. He was “ born short” there; 
he was born wonderfully “long” in other ways. 
The question is often asked, What are the conditions of 
genius? According to this theory, we will always have 
a genius whenever, in a given case, the brain and the 
Nervous organism in the individual are so perfect, on 
special lines, that the infiniteness of the mind, on these 
lines, can express itself fully through the media fur- 
nished. In these cases there is no hindrance whatever 
to the complete expression of certain parts of the sub- 
liminal self through the physical make-up of the individ- 
ual body in which that particular ego is conditioned. It 
goes without saying that absolutely perfect illustrations. 
of this condition are very rare, but most wonderful ones 
will readily come to mind. Mr. Edison is a most re- 
markable example, a marvelous one, in his particular
-P-A-G-E-70
62 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
lines of mental functioning. The list might be extended 
to great length, and in great variety, and I believe the 
theory would hold good in every case. 
Turn now to the other side of the picture, to those 
people who are the very reverse of geniuses, and whom 
we call idiots. The theory holds equally well with 
them. These people are all faulty in body, every one 
of them; and I have no doubt that if their peculiar phys- 
ical faults and weaknesses could be traced closely and 
definitely enough, it would be found that they were all 
of such naturé as to prevent certain functionings of the 
mind. It is their bad bodies and not their alleged feeble 
minds that cause their inability to express their red 
selves to any greater extent. 
I will say more about this later, but right here I want 
to answer the question proposed, some pages back, ia 
which I was asked to turn my piano figure around, and 
tell what would happen if we had a good instrument, 
but a fool for a player. Discord and bad music would 
result, in the case of such a piano and such a playeh 
surely. But, so far as humanity is concerned, no such 
condition has ever arisen or ever can arise. I challengé 
the whole world to disprove that statement. 
No one ever saw an idiot who had a normally cot 
structed body! In all these cases, the instrument is 
bad, and where it is bad, bad mental functioning results. 
On the other hand, not infrequently, and in many way’, 
there are not wanting pronounced signs that the playet 
is very far from being a fool. Here and there, there is 
a good string, and on such the musician can play. But 
so many parts of the instrument may be out of repaif 
or altogether wanting that but little music can be 
made. But that the player can produce harmony a
-P-A-G-E-71
UNDER THE THRESHOLD 63 
all shows that it is the instrument and not he that is at 
fault. : 
For instance, take the case of the idiot girl who could 
do such marvelous work in making lace with a crochet 
hook. Does this ability on her part suggest a weak 
mind ?—a fool for a player? Not one woman in a mil- 
lion could ever learn, with the help of the best teaching, 
to do what this girl did, with perfect ease,.without any 
instruction whatever. She was an idiot on some lines. 
She was a genius zz one way. She was a wonderful 
player where her instrument was perfect enough to per- 
mit her to come through. She was terribly hedged in 
at nearly every other point of her being — points on 
which most people can come through with at least 
so much success that they are not particularly notice- 
able among the general run of humanity. . 
And what is true of this girl is true of the majority 
of idiotic people. In almost every case, there will be 
found some expression of mental functioning which goes 
to prove that there is no lack of mental ability, in one 
of more directions. Did you ever know of such a case 
where it was not often said of the afflicted one, “Oh, 
he’s sharp enough, in some ways?” That is the whole 
story. These people are not feeble-minded. They are 
bad-bodied. This girl who could make lace had a queer- 
shaped head, and every idiot has a bad body, somewhere. 
Of course there are cases of this kind where there is 
almost no expression of mentality whatever, and in these 
cases the bodies are always bad in the extreme, espe- 
Cally on the brain and nervous-system sides. These 
very bad bodies almost completely cut the mind off from 
any possibility of expressing itself; and hence we have, 
in rare cases, complete idiocy. But I believe that even
-P-A-G-E-72
64 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
these cases are all caused by imperfect bodies, and not 
by feeble minds. 
And what is true of the bodily condition of idiots is 
very largely true concerning geniuses. Such people are 
always “peculiar looking.” If their genius takes an 
outré form, so much so that they are called “cranks,” 
you will nearly always find them very peculiar-looking 
persons, a fact which points towards the correctness of 
the theory that I am trying to show the reasonable 
ness of, 
As I have already remarked, it is sometimes said that 
genius is merely an appetite for hard work. The state- 
ment will not hold. It does not tally with the basic 
facts in the case. Any attainment that is gained by 
such a method is very far from being genius, in the true 
sense of that word. Some of the results reached in this 
way may resemble those of genius, but the process of 
their realization is a different thing entirely from the 
ways of genius itself. 
Genius knows its own without direction, in and of 
itself; and it has ways of arriving at its destination that 
the common lot of us know little or nothing about, and 
of which the genius himself can give no account. Zerab 
Colburn could not tell to any one how he arrived at the 
wonderful mathematical results which he obtained with 
out effort, nor could Blind Tom explain how it was that 
he could reproduce a piano selection, half an hour long, 
after hearing it once played through. All that can be 
said is, that these people were both “born long,” each 
in his own particular way. They were both true geniuses, 
of the genuine sort; and I believe it to be a fact that 
the reason they could do as they did was, not becausé 
they were mentally stronger than the rest of us, but be
-P-A-G-E-73
UNDER THE THRESHOLD 65 
cause their brain and nervous organisms were so perfect 
on the lines in which they gave their special expressions 
of power that there they could come through without 
a halt. : 
The best definition of genius that I ever came across 
is this: “Genius is the unconscious wisdom of peoplec— 
who are otherwise ignorant.” To me that states the 
whole case, perfectly. When genius, the teal thing, 
shows itself in an individual, the most we can say about 
it is that “that is the way he is.” And that the bodily 
machinery through which such remarkable abilities ex- 
press themselves determines the extent, or the limita- 
tions, of such expression —of this there seems to be 
little doubt. 
(I.can’t help remarking, just here, because the truth 
of it is so evident from what I have just said, that a/ 
genius, or a person who is “exceedingly bright” in any 
Particular line, is always the poorest kind of teacher, 
because he can never tell, or explain to another, how 
he arrives at results. And to be able to show the way to 
obtain correct results ts the very essence of successful 
teaching. Colburn could not teach mathematics, nor 
could Blind Tom teach music. I merely note the fact, 
in passing, for it is such a good one for teachers and for 
people who have to pick out teachers to remember, and 
One that is so often believed to be true in the very re- 
verse order of its actuality.) 
And so this is my theory regarding geniuses and 
their antipodes, and all of us who are between these 
two extremes. The way we are does not depend on our 
ultimate mentality, which is limitless in each and all, but 
on our ability to function mentally, to get the stream of 
mentality through the medium it must use if it reveals 
F
-P-A-G-E-74
66 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
itself in time’and space. And the range of this ability 
is determined by the more or less perfect condition 
of the bodily organ through which such functioning 
alone can be done. At least, this is how “it seems 
to me.”

~—Some Authorities on these Points. 
Ir is curious how fast, how far, and into what un- 
looked-for regions a theory once started may lead one. 
And so I find myself just here irresistibly compelled to 
push at least a little way into a realm that I had not 
thought of exploring when I first set out. The cases I 
am about to note are again more of the adult order 
than of the “born so” variety; but they are strongly 
in point as regards the main issue. Perhaps they might 
"be counted as acute or temporary instances of condi- 
tions that are chronic in congenital cases. My chief 
Teason for presenting them is because they multiply and 
intensify the proofs that “these things are in the body.” 
Besides that, they will have a direct bearing on the main 
issue of this book when I reach that part of my story. 
And so it is that my investigations and theories as to 
what is the truth regarding the real, basic causes of 
genius, idiocy, insanity, and of all similar variations 
67 .

from what we are wont to consider as normality in 
humanity, suggest the possibility that the same prin. 
ciples hold equally true regarding the causes of vice 
and crime, as these are manifest in mankind. That 
may appear, at first sight, as a very dangerous doctrine 
to announce, but this is not an issue of danger, or its 
opposite. The question is, What is the truth in the 
premises ? 
Anent which, let it not be forgotten that it is but a 
few years since insanity was looked upon as a crime 
and insane men and women were strapped to the wall 
and lashed, as a penalty for what was counted as their 
deliberate wrongdoing. 
We talk about human responsibility, man’s “free 
agency,” and the like. Such themes are worthy to be 
considered, but —~ well, here are some cases that have 
made me think a great deal regarding such things. Read 
them, and then see what you think. And be sure that 
you think, and that you think for yourself. 
I once had a friend who served a term in the peniter 
tiary for embezzlement. I make no scruple in saying 
that he was my friend, my very dear friend, both be 
fore and after his incarceration. In many respects he 
was one of the best men I ever knew. He was truly 
generous and nobly self-sacrificing ; and he was truth 
ful, and thoroughly reliable in most ways. But all the 
time I knew him he was a gambler. On that side of 
his make-up he was not to be trusted for.an instant 
He would gamble on anything, anywhere, at any time 
On that point he had no conscience, no prudence, no ally 
thing, but an uncontrollable desire to try his luck on the 
game. He would risk all he had himself, and all that 
anybody else had that he could lay hands on, on the
-P-A-G-E-77
SOME DARKER STUDIES 69 
turn of a card or a throw of dice. That was how he got 
into the penite:.tiary. He happened to have a large 
amount of his employer's money in his pocket one day, 
and he risked i* all, and lost. So he was “sent up.” 
What about this case? To me the man was insane 
on that side of his being. There, he could not see 
things as they rea‘ly were. He had a mania for taking 
chances. He was as mad, on the line of gambling, as 
any patient in an insane asylum is crazy in any other 
direction. . 
And I believe this unfortunate condition of his was 
seated in his body, just as much as is the case in any 
other kind of insanity. So far as I could learn his early 
history, he showed no sign of his madness in his earlier 
years. He was the son of a clergyman who was a man 
of great ability and of sterling worth. But, as a young 
man, he suddenly began to gamble. It became an un- 
controllable passion with him, and it is not putting the 
“Case any too strongly to say that he became gambling 
mad, 
Well, you say, what about it? Was this man not re- 
sponsible for what he did? Ought he not to be punished 
for his misdeeds? To which I reply, most assuredly he 
ought to be kept from injuring himself and other people 
by the exercise of his mania, just as other insane people 
have to be kept from injuring themselves and others by 
Teason of their insanity. 
As things now are, we “punish” such as him; we 
brand them as criminals, we heap indignities upon them 
and expect, by so doing, to rid them of their sins. I 
blame no one for this; but, to my way of thinking, the 
day is not so very far distant when we shall look back 
upon our present way of treating crime and criminals

with as much horror as we would now shudder at strap. 
ping the insane to a wall and lashing them till the 
blood came. 
I may be wrong in this, but I don’t think I am. 
Let me tell a little more of this friend of mine 
After he came out of prison, he went to work for me (I 
was in a manufacturing business then) and he held his 
place as long as he was able to work at all. He died 
three years after his term of sentence expired. 
He was the best salesman I ever knew. In three 
years he legitimately earned more than ten thousand 
dollars, all of which he gave to a brother of his who, 
at my friend’s request, acted as his trustee. That was 
the way he put himself out of the way of temptation 
He would never allow himself to handle a cent of my 
money. We both knew it would not be safe for him to 
do so. It would have been unfair and unjust, both 1 
him and to me, to have him try to do so. That way his 
weakness, his madness lay; and it would have beet 
little short of a crime should a strain have been put 
him where we both knew he was not strong. . 
He gambled, off and on, almost to the day of bis 
death. Sometimes months would pass, during which he 
would not play; and then, again, he would have daysal 
gaming. But because he kept very little money with 
him, he held his madness within such bounds that~ 
well, he kept himself out of prison, anyhow. 
After his death, an autopsy revealed the fact tha 
for years he had suffered from a tumor on his bra 
I may be wrong in my surmise, but I am strongly * 
clined to believe that this physical disturbance of his 
nervous system was the real cause of his gambling 
mania. There are many reasons that lead me to this
-P-A-G-E-79
SOME DARKER STUDIES 7E 
conclusion, but space will not permit me to state them 
here. Similar cases have already been noted by eminent 
authorities who have made a life study of the psychology 
of vice and crime, and new light in this direction is 
shining through every day. 
I recently read a well-authenticated account of a 
bookkeeper who suddenly lost his ability to.add figures, 
an art in which he had for years been an expert. A 
little later he became insane, to such a degree that he 
was committed to an asylum. There, a tumor was re- 
moved from his brain, and he returned to his normal 
condition, resuming his former position, where he was 
able to work as well as ever. 
Another case was that of a man who suddenly be- 
came brutally jealous of his wife without any cause on 
her part for his being so. This condition continued till 
he tried to murder her, after which his friends were 
obliged to have him taken to an insane hospital. There, 
being relieved from an abnormal pressure upon a part 
of his brain, caused by some subtle disease, his jealousy 
vanished, and he regained his former condition of do- 
mestic happiness and love. 
Now all this does not mean that corps of surgeons 
could start out with saws, knives, scissors, and scoops, 
and in a few minutes so trim up mankind, within and 
without, that there would be no more sin, misery, vice, 
and crime in the world. But these cases, and scores of 
others that we all know about, lead one to think that, in 
large degree, if not altogether, the ills and crimes of 
humanity are seated in the body, which is my original 
Contention. And, if these things are so, or even so to 
a considerable extent, they are things for parents and 
teachers to know about, and to regulate their actions

in accordance with, in attempting to educate al, the 
children of all the people. : 
This friend of whom I have spoken used to talk to me 
about his prison experience. He was a remarkably 
able and intelligent man, keenly observant, and exceed- 
ingly wise in his conclusions on nearly all affairs. And 
he assured me that a very large percentage of the in 
mates of the prison he was in were incapable of taking 
care of themselves. “They were simply a herd of im 
competents,” is the way he put it. I have never for 
gotten that phrase. It is a statement to remember and 
never to forget, as one looks at children and thinks of 
the future. 
Can you remember some act or acts of yours, that you 
did without the least thought that they were wrong, whet 
you were doing ‘them, but which acts were really bad, 
perhaps very bad? Maybe you say: “But I was too 
young to know.” Count it so. Then remember that 
there are many people who are always young, or who 
never can come through on certain lines. Call it ‘arrested 
development,” or what you will, the fact remains tha 
many people do not, yes, cannot, see clearly the ways in 
which they go wrong. It may not be so always, but it 
is so sometimes, is it not? At least you have found its 
in your own experience, haven’t you? I have, Read 
Stanley Hall’s book on Adolescence for cases on this 
point. 
I am inclined to think that few children have any reat 
ization whatever of the enormity of their deeds when they 
rob birds’ nests, or pull the legs off grasshoppers, or the 
wings from butterflies. Did you ever pluck watermelons 
that you had never planted, but which you took by the 
light of the moon with great delight, and which you d¢

voured without a qualm? And did you feel'so very bad 
about it at the time? Have you ever been abroad and 
returned with trunks full of things that were dutiable, 
and then — did you feel so very bad about what you did? 
Did you look the officer in the eye as you walked past 
him with the tucks in your skirt stuffed full of undeclared 
laces—as full as they could be and not show? And did 
you feel very bad about it, when, relying on the steadiness 
of your gaze, that same official passed you without a 
word? Did you feel that you had done anything so very 
wrong, after allthis? Who is it that says, “All women 
are born smugglers” ? 
But it is a sin to smuggle, to deliberately break the 
law of one’s country. All people who can see clearly 
on this side of their being, who can come through there, 
know that this is so. But there are multitudes of peo- 
ple in this country, both men and women, who do not 
see it, and who, from the evidence in the case, it would 
seem cannot see it that way. All of which means that 
there are many persons in this country who are practi- 
cally children, or insane, on that side of their lives. 
They exhibit well marked cases of arrested develop- 
ment, or insanity, in this part of their make-up. They 
do not deliberately do wrong. Their failure is in being 
unable to realize that what they do is really wrong. 
They will acknowledge that they have broken a law; 
but, to them, it is a law, and not themselves, that is 
Wrong. They are “short” in that part of their make- 
up. Their ultimate moral sense cannot “come through ” 
at these places. Their moral eyes are blind. They can- 
hot see things as they are. 
I believe that, as a rule, all thieves feel that-way about 
their robberies. They know that they break laws by

74 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE. PEOPLE 
doing as they do; but, to them, the laws are wrong, and 
not they themselves. For reasons which seem to them 
sufficient, they, at the time of their misdeeds, feel that 
they are only doing what they have a right to do, all 
things considered. This, if they think at all. Many 
of the worst cases cannot think clearly at all—can- 
not “come through,” or function in these mental 
places. 
Alawyer who had hadan experience of twenty-five years 
at the bar to base his statement on once told me that he 
had never been called on to defend a criminal who would 
acknowledge that he was guilty of the crime with which 
he was charged, no matter what that crime might be 
Such might confess to having done certain deeds, but 
they would never acknowledge that such doing was 
wrong. They always had some reason to offer which 
justified their action, allowing them to be their ow? 
judge. In the presence of such testimony, can one 
doubt that these people have eyes and see not, that 
there are spots where they cannot “come through ") 
Of course they are wrong in all this, when viewed 
from a social standpoint; and, being so, not seeing 
things as théy are, they cannot be left free to prey upo® 
their fellows; but their attitudes of mind should, 
right, be taken into account in the way society deals 
with such —in the manner in which it makes “the pe 
alty fit the crime.” . 
Nor do I think that all these have tumor on the bral 
In most cases the trouble goes further back than that~ 
they are born so. But I do believe that, in every ca 
the trouble lies, basically, in the imperfect bodies ¢ 
these wrongdoers rather than elsewhere. If the bral 
and nervous organism of each one of these derelict
-P-A-G-E-83
SOME DARKER STUDIES .. 15 
could be made normal, there is small doubt that their 
actions would tally with right, and not with wrong. 
It is doubtless true that Jesus had such as these in 
mind when he said: “Seeing, they see and do not per- 
ceive; hearing, they hear and do not. understand.” 
How wonderfully well the Great Teacher knew human- 
ity. Surely, the noblest prayer that was ever prayed 
came from his lips, when he said, “ Father, forgive them; 
they know not what they do.” The real foundation 
trouble with us, and with all, always, when we go wrong, 
is that we do not really know what we are doing. 
Therefore, let us be charitable, both to ourselves and to 
our neighbors, all over the world. “For such is the 
kingdom of heaven.” 
When my wife had read the manuscript of this chap- 
ter, she said to me, “I think it must be true that when- 
ever the chance of a desire to come through is stronger 
than the power of the will to keep it from doing so, then 
the individual becomes insane!” I think she is right. 
Which leads me to add that, as I write these words, 
there comes to me the report of the suicide of a young 
man who has been my neighbor for years. He was one 
of the noblest men I have ever known. He was happily 
married. His wife is a lovely woman and they have 
two beautiful children. He was in excellent financial 
circumstances, and was loved and honored by all who 
knew him, yet he took his own life. His mother died 
by her own hand, a few years ago. “The taint is in the 
blood,” we say. And we say well. The physical organ- 
ism was, I believe, in each of these cases, so faulty, on 
certain lines, that the desire to die came through stronger 
than the will to live. The victims were insane, and so
-P-A-G-E-84
76 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
they did as they did. At the coroner’s inquest over the 
death of this young man, the fact was disclosed that his 
heart-beat rate had always been less than fifty to the 
minute — was so from birth. Truly, such fact is sig- . 
nificant, and in line with my theory. 
Surely, for teachers and parents who have to deal 
with children who go wrong, these cases, and their likes, 
must give us pause. For so many of us and ours, and 
the rest, are wont to go wrong —to have desire come 
through stronger than will comes through, to be in 
sane, at least in spots. 
I am well aware that I have only skimmed the surface 
of the vital themes touched upon in these latest chapters. 
The literature that discusses them in detail is very volt- 
minous; but it has, so far, reached only specialists, and 
they, largely, are medical men and not parents and 
teachers. But because the mental and moral issues it- 
volved are so closely linked to the subject I am consid- 
ering, I have deemed it wise to introduce as much of 
this related matter as I have in these pages. No teacher 
is thoroughly equipped for first-class professional work 
who is not fairly well posted in this particular field of 
psychological investigation. Its complete mastery i 
of course, possible only for the specialist, the subject is 
so far-reaching. Thus, Havelock Ellis, in his “ Studies 
in the Psychology of Sex,” on which he labored thitty 
years, quotes from more than one thousand authors, 
ancient and modern, who have made a more or les 
thorough study of this theme, and it is safe to say tha 
there is scarce an observation in all the mass of test 
mony which these experts have brought together 
through the years that is not vitally related to. the 
problem we are now considering. My presentation of
-P-A-G-E-85
SOME DARKER STUDIES 7 
the subject is suggestive and not exhaustive, especially 
in these last chapters. If enough has been said, how- 
ever, to set the readers to thinking, to have aroused an 
interest in the theme which will lead to further study of 
the issues involved, I am satisfied. Let the experts tell 
you the details through their books and essays which 
are within the reach of all who care to hunt them out. 
Read any one of the many—Stanley Hall, Boris 
Sidis, William James, Havelock Ellis, or a dozen others to 
start on, and then follow the trail they begin for you, 
and you will arrive. They all produce testimony that 
is of the highest value for use by any and all who are 
engaged on the problem of trying to educate all the 
children of all the people. :

T am well aware that this view of ourselves and of our 
fellow men, of our being “born long” or “born short” 
here or there, and of our being twisted out of the 
straight line of right by our bodily conditions, which 
may be congenital or which may be imposed upon us by 
accident or disease —I know very well that this way of 
looking at humanity has not always been foremost is 
the minds of men, in days gone by; and that, for this 
reason, very little provision so far has been made for 
dealing with humanity on this basis. 
I believe, though, that Jesus saw the truth in the 
premises, and that he treated mankind and womankind 
on the basis of their wrong-goings being seated in the 
body. If you do not see it that way, read the story of 
the Thief. on the Cross, and of the woman who “wa 
taken in the act,” and then see how it seems to you. 
But we cannot let these people who are blind aad 
78
-P-A-G-E-87
WHAT FOLLOWS? 79 
deaf to the right, who are insane and criminal, go where 
they will and do as they please. Surely not; for so 
would the blind lead the blind, and all would fall into 
the ditch, There are such things as right and wrong, 
and let none ever forget or disregard the fact. 
Truth is eternal, and it never swerves. 
And right and truth must be taken into account in all 
righteous living. For righteous living is what all the 
experiences of life are for. The question is: How can 
these people who are “born short” in one way or an- 
other, or who are idiotic, or insane, or vicious, or crimi- 
nal because of disease, or accident, or physical harm of 
any kind — how can these people who are out of the line 
of righteousness — how can such be brought into line 
and led to tally with right and truth? That is the chief 
question of all time. To help solve this question Christ 
gave his life, and it is only by the giving of life that you, 
or I, or anybody, can in any way help on its solution. 
That is the first thing to remember. 
But it will help us all, oh so much, if we, first of all, 
tealize the situation; if we have a realizing sense of 
things as they are, and especially if we keep in mind the 
way we are ourselves, and by the same token the way 
our brothers and sisters, and especially our children, are 
also, That is the true beginning point. Without such 
a basis to start on, such a foundation under our feet, 
there can be no progress in the work undertaken. 
And so I believe that the first thing for us all to do is, 
to try to bring ourselves to a clear and full understanding 
of the fact that we are all of us “born long” on some 
lines and “short” on some other lines, or that we have 
been rendered short by accident or disease; and that 
our possibilities of mental functioning and resultant
-P-A-G-E-88

      doing, in one direction or another, are in very large 
measure determined by our bodily excellences or in 
firmities; and, further, that the greatest good will come 
to each and every one of us by permitting us to move 
out strongly on the lines of our natural abilities — our 
“ longages ” — when these are on the line of right; and, 
beyond this, where we are weak, or short, or idiotic, or 
insane, or criminal, all that can be done should be done ° 
to help us to overcome our infirmities and difficulties, and 
to bring us into line with right and truth, all these things 
being taken into the account. 
But, to do this last, let us never be held back where 
we are naturally and righteously long and strong, in an 
effort to make us “symmetrical,” that is, equally long 
and strong everywhere else. That is the whole issue. 
There is where we have all gone wrong, time and time 
again, in our treatment of ourselves and of those with 
whom we have had to do, especially the children. There 
is where our public schools have sinned terribly. There 
is where they must stop sinning, if they ever educate all 
the children of all the people. 
What, then, shall we do with these shorts, these idiots, 
these insane, these vicious ones, these criminals? Well 
we shall do the best we can with them and for thet, 
things being as they are. But, first of all, we shall love 
them, every one, “not with allowance, but with genuiné 
love”; and we shall despise none of them, not even the 
meanest and lowest. That’ is, we shall almost entirely 
change our mental attitude towards any and all such 
people. 
Things being as they are, we shall have to “ punish” 
many of them, especially those who exhibit the most 
pronounced casés of waywardness, for a good while 
1
-P-A-G-E-89
WHAT FOLLOWS? - 82 
yet; we shall have to shut a good many of ‘them up, 
and keep them where they cannot harm themselves or 
others. I do not believe we shall always “punish” in 
many of the ways we now use, and we ought never to 
kill any of them. 
(It brought my heart into my throat when I read 
the last words of President McKinley’s assassin: “I 
thought what I did would help the poor. people.” 
Could any save man ever have thought that? Is it not 
clear that this man who took the President's life was 
blind on that side of his being; that there he could 
not see things as they really were; that there he was 
idiotic, or insane? 
Of course he and his like cannot be permitted to 
go about shooting Presidents, or Kings, or Emperors. 
They must be kept from such exercise of their crazed 
purposes, But I believe the time will come when such 
erratics will not be killed. I believe the hour will 
strike when even suck as these will be loved and pitied, 
rather than cursed and hated; when the way they are 
will be taken into the account, in passing judgment 
upon them. I believe that, in his inmost soul, Presi- 
dent McKinley had no desire that his assassin’s life 
should be taken. But, as things were, he. could only 
say: “Suffer it to be so now.” There are better days 
ahead of us than have ever yet been.) : 
Again, it will help us greatly if we can bring our- 
selves to realize that these variations in humanity that 
tend towards unrighteousness, these “shorts” of one 
kind or another, are not confined to any one class of 
People, to any one stratum of society, or to any one 
tealm of life. In other words, if we are wise we shall 
Come to understand, for one thing, that there is no such . 
G

82 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
vy thing as a “criminal class” of people, in the ordinary 
sense of that phrase. 
Doubtless Lombroso and his coadjutors are in large 
measure right in the things they have written about 
criminals. But very many of the conclusions that have 
been drawn from their investigations and writings are 
altogether wrong. Many of the physical signs of 
criminality that they have noted are true to the line; 
but the conclusion that these signs manifest themselves 
wholly, or in any considerable majority, in any partice 
lar class, or branch, of human society — this is entirely 
wrong. Criminality knows no such thing as class, of 
rank, or station in life. Such “shorts” are in evidence 
on every round of the social ladder, in every grade of 
human life. History gives ample proof that kings 
there have been who were not exempt, and that beg 
gars have lived who were in like case. Some of the 
clergy, of the highest rank, have suffered from the 
same cause, and there have ‘een unbelievers who 
showed signs of lack in the same direction. In many 
of these the physical signs of errancy may have 
showed in much the same way, and in this respet 
Lombroso is right. The faults were in their bodies, and 
Lombroso translated the outward showings correctly. 
But the conclusion that is often drawn, that there is 4 
criminal class that springs from, or is chiefly recruited 
from, some particular class of society — this is not true 
If this fact is kept in mind, it will clear away a lot of 
rubbish that often appears in the form of misunderstant 
ing, prejudice, and injustice, in the practical work of 
parents and teachers who have to deal with all sorts of 
“shorts ” in the family and schoolroom. 
Again, it will help greatly, in a general way, to under
-P-A-G-E-91
WHAT FOLLOWS? 83 
stand that we must not be too hasty in making up our 
minds as to the “longs” and “ shorts” of any given in- 
dividual, ourselves included. There are hard and fast 
lines in these premises, boundaries that cannot be 
broken over or passed, in every one of us; but we 
should never be hasty in thinking that we have dis- 
covered such as these in ourselves, or in our children, or 
inour pupils. Good hard common sense, and a diligent, 
faithful, intelligent study of these things as they really 
are, in any given individual, will keep us from going 
wrong here. Only this: keep in mind that we are 
always to seek for the natural ways of the individual, 
those that are in the line of righteousness, and to help, 
to the uttermost, in these directions, knowing that such 
Movement, free and joyous, will always tend to the best 
interest of all parties concerned. And where there is 
weakness in any given case, we will do the best we can 
tohelp overcome such condition, but never at the ex- 
pense of retarding what is already strong. If I have 
one bad leg, it can never be made good by my being 
Prohibited from using my good leg till the bad one is 
equally sound and usable. That is a fundamental prin- 
ciple, one never to be forgotten. 
But, while there are hard and fast lines and impass- 
able boundaries in the make-up of all of us, yet, in large 
Measure, the great bulk of humanity can move out in 
Many like directions, most of which are so common to 
mankind that we count them as normal. Thus, most 
children can learn to read, though some can master this ac- 
complishment much more easily than others. As I have 
already said, I have known cases where the art of read- 
ing came so naturally to the child that he never had to 
be taught at all. I have known other cases where it was
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
exceedingly difficult to get the pupil to read very much, 
or very well, even at the expense of a great amount of 
teaching. In some of these latter cases the pupils 
were normally strong in other directions; in a few they 
were exceedingly able in one or more other ways. I 
have a record of a few instances where pupils could not 
learn to read at all, and yet they were thoroughly nor- 
mal in several other ways. The range is almost infinite, 
here and otherwhere. But, in each and every case, the 
child should be cared for according to the way he natw 
rally is, and not according to some fixed plan that some 
body has laid down as the regular thing for all children 
to attain to.. And, above all, as I have said more than 
once, the child should never be hindered where he is 
strong, to make good where he is weak. 
Again, it-sometimes happens in a marked degree, aad 
in most children it is true to a considerable extent, that 
possibilities, “longs” and “shorts,” vary as the chil 
grows. A child is an undeveloped quantity, and i 
capabilities are not all “worn on its sleeve” from we 
first. It is for this reason that one should not be {00 
much in a hurry in declaring that a given child is “long 
or “short,” here or there. But if we keep our ey 
open, there is small danger of our going wrong het 
There are no Mede-and-Persian laws that will universal 
apply to the individual soul. Each case must be stu 
_ by itself, and action determined according to 
every time and continually. 
And it sometimes happens that very marked change 
in the possibilities of a given child may suddenly appeah 
for good and sufficient reasons. Dr. Sperry, of Oberlin 
Ohio, tells of a boy whose case came under his observ 
tion, which well illustrates this point,
-P-A-G-E-93
WHAT FOLLOWS? 85 
This boy had been cared for by a charitable institution 
for some years, but had never been able to learn to read. 
Finally the manager of the institution came to the con- 
clusion that it was unwise to keep him any longer, as 
there were no scholarly possibilities for him, and he was 
filling a place that some more promising child might 
occupy. So he called the boy and told him that he 
would have to leave the institution. It nearly broke the 
poor fellow’s heart, and he cried all-night about it. In the 
morning he came down to breakfast with his reading 
book in his hand, and, going to his teacher, he said: “I 
can read!” And he could. The doctor says that from 
that time on the boy learned to read rapidly, and that he 
afterwards pursued an extended course of study success- 
fully. The case is surely rare, at least few such have 
ever been reported, but it is very significant, and well 
Worth noting. 
One of the most remarkable cases of this sudden 
change in the possibilities and impossibilities of a child 
that has ever met my attention is that of the late Dr. W. 
J. Stillman, as he reports it in his autobiography, which 
was published in the A¢lantic Monthly for 1900, and 
which, I think, has since appeared in book form. In the 
first chapter of the story of his life he relates that he was - 
a wonderfully precocious child. He says: “My mother 
taught me my letters before I could articulate them, and 
when I was two I could read, and at three I was put on 
a high stool to read the Bible for visitors, so that I can- 
not remember when I could not read.” He then goes 
on to tell how he held this pace, so to speak, till he was 
seven years of age, being counted a prodigy by all the 
community in which he lived. He read everything that 
he could lay hands on, and could relate with great
-P-A-G-E-94
86 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
fluency all that he read. But he had a severe attack of 
typhoid fever when he was seven, “ out of which,” he says, 
“T came a model of stupidity, and so remained till I was 
fourteen, my thinking powers being so completely sus 
pended, that at the dame’s school to which I was sent,1 
was repeatedly flogged for not comprehending the sim 
plest things.” (Think of it!) ‘I got through simple 
arithmetic as far as long division, and there I had to 
be turned back to the beginning three times, before! 
could be made to understand the principle of division by 
more than one number.” 
The “intellectual slowness,” he says, “continued yeat 
after year.” He was kept in school (for his parents 
were anxious that he should become a clergyman), ia 
spite of his mental disabilities. He studied hard, bit 
made little progress worth mentioning. The story he 
tells of his life for seven years is one of the most patheti 
Thave ever read. At times it is little short of a tragedy} 
as witness the following: “It often happened that whet 
a question that had passed the other pupils came to m6 
the teacher used to address me, ‘ Well, stupid, what do 
you say?’” If that is not tragedy, I don’t know wh#t 
is. And yet, I have heard teachers do the like, and # 
have you. 
What follows in his story is so remarkable that 1 
sure I shall be excused for quoting it at length. 
year that he was fourteen he was placed in a boarding 
school, and of his experience there he writes: «The 
persistent apathy which had oppressed me for so mall 
years still refused to lift, and my stupidity in learni 
was such that my brother threatened to send me hoot 
as a disgrace to the family. I had taken up Latin age 
algebra and geometry; and though I was up by cal

light in the morning, and rarely put my books away till 
after ten at night, except for meals, it was impossible for 
me to construe half the lesson in Virgil, and geometry 
was leamed by rote. I gave up exercise in order to gain 
time for study, and my despairing struggles were misery. 
Iwas then fourteen, in the seventh year of this dark- 
ness, and it seemed to me hopeless. 
“What happened I know not, but about the middle 
of the first term the mental fog broke away suddenly, 
and before the term ended I could construe the Latin in 
less time than it took to recite it, and the demonstrations 
of Euclid were as clear to me as a fairy story. My 
memory came back so completely that I could recite 
poems after a single reading, and no member of the 
class passed a more brilliant examination at the close of 
theterm than I. At the end of the second term I could 
Tecite the whole of Legendre’s Geometry, plane and 
spherical, without a question, and the class examination 
was recorded as the most brilliant which the academy 
had witnessed for many years. I have never been able 
to conceive an explanation of this curious phenomenon, 
which I only record as of possible interest to some 
student of psychology.” 
Such is this most remarkable record, and it surely is 
of interest to every teacher and parent, even if they 
have never heard the word “ psychology.” And it is of 
Still more significance to all who are engaged in trying 
to educate all the children of all the people.

Have you any theory as to the cause that underlay 
this most remarkable case of Dr. Stillman? There 
must have been a cause, and the case must be accounted 
for, by any theory that is at all worthy of consideration. 
Nor does it seem to me that such cause is far to seek. 
To me it appears more than probable that the variation 
in the possibilities of this individual, as they appeared, 
so widely different, from time to time, were all the r 
sult of changed dodily conditions — that they were alt 
seated in the body and not in the mind. 
For, see! First, we have a child who is able to e* 
press himself, to come through, to a remarkable degreé 
—far beyond the average. At seven he is sick unto 
death with a disease that is noted for the changes it 
makes in the bodily condition of those who recovef 
from its malignant attacks. Here, surely, is a change 
of the body, rather than of the mind. Out of this e* 
88
-P-A-G-E-97
AGAIN THE BODY 89 
perience he came wholly unable to express himself (to 
come through) as he had formerly done. This condi- 
tion continued till he was fourteen years old, or, in other 
words, till he came to puberty! Then his former pos- 
sibilities again appeared with wonderful suddenness, and 
they remained with him the rest of his long and useful 
life. 
(Perhaps I ought to say, right here, to save the read- 
er’s “looking up,” that Dr. Stillman became famous in ~ 
more than one continent, and that, as a scholar, diplo- 
mat, and statesman, he ranked among the first.. He 
tepresented the United States at Rome for many years; 
he was the friend and comrade of Ruskin, and was 
closely associated with Browning and Emerson, as well 
as with others of the leading minds of his day.) 
But from seven to fourteen this individual was so 
nearly imbecile that his teachers used to address him 
as “stupid,” and it took him three terms of school to 
master long division. These are things for all of us to’ 
Temember, and there is no question as to the facts in 
the case. And, as said before, let it never be forgotten 
that a fact, once established, is something that must be 
accounted for, and that can never be gotten over. 
It seems strange that Dr. Stillman should not have 
observed that his recovery of his lost abilities came at 
the time of his entering into manhood; and that he 
should not have at least suspected that there was a close 
telation between these two facts, that one was the cause 
of the other. But, be that as it may, it is quite evident 
that this is the true explanation of what happened. At 
puberty wonderful changes take place in the human 
body, as Stanley Hall has so ably shown in his studies 
of Adolescence, and these open up the way for new
-P-A-G-E-98
go ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
possibilities of expression for the human mind, of new 
abilities to function in the mental plane. This is true, 
in large degree, in the case of nearly every individual. 
The results are rarely as remarkable as in this case, but 
the causes are the same in the whole human family. 
My theory is that, in the case of Dr. Stillman, the 
severe sickness that he had when he was seven left him 
with some clog upon certain portions of his brain or 
nervous organism, the parts that had to do with his 
power to express himself before he was sick, but which 
he was unable to use when he got well again. Here 
he was stopped off, so to speak, for seven long years. 
Here he could not come through as he had once done. 
Perhaps there was a stoppage in the proper supply of 
blood for these parts of the brain, while other parts 
were not so affected. I do not know. I do not know 
that any one knows just exactly what happened; but I 
think it is clear that the trouble was all in the body of 
the boy, and not in his mind. 
My reason for thinking so is that suddenly he was 
restored to a former condition, was able to express him 
self as aforetime, and that just when great bodily 
changes came to him. I have an idea that these bodily 
changes, which came at puberty, broke down the clogs 
that had interrupted the coming through of this lad of 
so many lines for so many years; and that, these bar 
riers being removed, he could again express himself 2 
he had formerly done — could function in certain met 
tal planes as aforetime. 
I ought to add that young Stillman was not “stopped 
off” in ad/ his abilities to function in mental planes dur 
ing these seven lean years, His knowledge of nature 
plants, flowers, and animals, and his love for- studying
-P-A-G-E-99
AGAIN THE BODY . gt 
them — were as great as ever, and constantly grew to 
moreand more. But all these points on which he could 
still function were relegated to disuse by his parents and 
teachers in order that he might gain book knowledge, 
where he had become “short.” 
Nor do I believe that “keeping him everlastingly at” 
these studies was the cause of his mastering them. 
The dénouement was too sudden to make this theory 
account for such result. In such case, his progress 
would have been gradual. He did make some gradual 
Progress in his studies during the years of his affliction. 
But the relief came iz an instant, and without effort on 
his part. Such is not the way of plodding. It was not - 
steady progress as a result of persistent effort that 
caused him to arrive, but a sudden illumiration that 
came unlooked for and unsought. 
Think on this for a minute, teacher or parent or 
other reader. 
But was there anything the matter with this boy's 
mind, with his inmost self, during these seven strange 
years? Surely not. He was all right, all the time. 
The instrument he had to play on was out of repair in 
some places for a time, and so he could then make no 
music on these keys—some hammer was unglued or 
Peg broken, for the time being. When these bad 
Places were made good, then he could play again as he 
had once done. 
And do not the facts that he had played once, and 
then could not play for a while, and then could play 
again after great bodily changes had come to him, — do 
not these things all prove that the trouble was entirely 
in the instrument and not at all in the player —that it 
was the body and not the mind of this individual that
-P-A-G-E-100
g2 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
was at fault? It seems to me that there can be small 
question as to the truth of such surmise; indeed, that 
the facts cannot be accounted for in any other way. 
And if these things are so (and I firmly believe they 
are), what rows on rows of interrogation marks they set 
upon end, to question many of our acts as parents and 
teachers? And how are these question marks followed 
by rows on rows of marks of command, declaring that 
we must mend our ways in these regards! If the 
bodily conditions of our children and pupils are as 
fundamental and important as all these things indicate, 
what are we going to do about it? 
And again I say, we must do the best we can. 
But first of all we must have regard to the facts in the 
case, and act accordingly, to the best of our ability 
things being as they are. . 
(Just here I received a report of a most suggestive 
case in point from a teacher of “short” children in the 
public schools of New York City. She has among her 
pupils a boy of twelve who is now very limited in 
his: possibilities. And yet this same boy had a most 
excellent school record up to the time he was ten yeals 
of age. But at that time of his life he had his skull 
fractured by falling from a fire escape in trying to gt 
out of a burning apartment building. The injury ws 
so severe that his life hung by a thread for weeks, but 
he finally lived. But he lives as only a part of his 
former mental self. He is now able to do almost 
nothing at all with books, and is almost entirely imbecile 
regarding subjects on which he was once able to express 
himself well. Can any one say that this boy's misd 
was dashed out on a curbstone? It was not his mind 
but his body, that was broken. And the possibility of .
-P-A-G-E-101
AGAIN THE BODY ag 93 
his mind using his body was thereby limited) The hurt 
is probably of a sort that the changes that come at 
puberty will never rectify —that nothing can’ modify ; 
but the case furnishes one more proof that “these 
things are in the body.” So I note it here.) 
And so we must learn to esteem the bodies of our 
children and. pupils as of far more importance than they 
were once considered to be, and give attention to them 
accordingly. As fast as we can attain to it, we must 
have these bodies examined by those who are competent 
to pass judgment upon them; and, as far as possible, 
thus learn what their condition is, in each and every 
case. Especially should this be done with children who 
show signs of variation from normal lines. I am.no 
expert, but I once found, in a school I visited, a boy 
twelve years old who was blind in one eye; and yet 
heither his teachers nor his parents had ever discovered 
the fact! He was two grades below where he should _ 
have been, in the natural order of things, and his bad 
eye was the cause of it. Both his parents. and his 
teachers considered him stupid, and there we are again. 
And this case of carelessness and neglect is not nearly 
a8 rare as it may seem to be. 
But I need not take time to speak in detail of near- 
sightedness, partial deafness, semi-paralysis of one organ 
or another, and many other bodily defects which hamper 
Pupils in their progress in school. Thank Heaven, some 
teachers are beginning to recognize them as factors in 
the work attempted in the schoolroom, and now and 
then they modify what they attempt to do for one pupil 
or another, accordingly. But far too largely, as yet, 
these things are as idle tales to many teachers, both 
of high and low degree. Yet the light is coming
-P-A-G-E-102
94 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
through, all along the line. I shall say more about 
this later. 
And now a word or two as to what can probably be 
done with these poor, or bad-bodied pupils — the “shorts,” 
in one way or another. 
In the first place, I am convinced that, where the 
shortage is decidedly pronounced, there is not nearly 
the percentage of possibility for advancement, on the 
lines of the shortage, that has generally been supposed. 
This may seem a hard saying, but the truth must be 
told, and I believe this to be true. Colonel Parker once 
said to me, “Oh, Mr. Smith, your doctrine is so hope 
less!” To which I replied, “That all depends.” But 
I will return to this later, also. 
Where the shortage in the child is so pronounced that 
it amounts to idiocy, let it be said, once for all, that 
there is small chance for such a child ever advancing 
very far along its idiotic lines. It may progress, some 
times far beyond a normal child, in some other direc 
tions, but rarely along the lines of its shortage. Where 
the idiocy includes a large number of the faculties of 
the child, there is little use of even hoping that sucha 
child can be brought to the standard of normality. 1 
need not say that such cases are uncommon, but they 
exist; and where they do exist, they prove the truth of 
what I have said, There are human bodies that are ia 
such bad shape, that were so from the beginning (they 
were born so), or that have been made so by accident 
(as in the case of the boy who fell from the ladder and 
broke his skull), or by disease of some sort, that the 
imprisoned minds that live in them can come through 
but very little — sometimes not at all. Yet these bodies 
live, sometimes for years.
-P-A-G-E-103
AGAIN THE BODY . 98 
But I do not call even these cases hopeless. These 
are the ones Walt Whitman ‘has in mind, when be says: 
“1 saw the face of the most smeared and slobbering idiot in the 
asylum, : 
And I knew for my consolation what they did not know. 
I know the agents that emptied and broke my brother, 
And I know that the same Power waits, calm and patient, to clear 
away the rubbish ; 
And one of these days I ‘shall meet the real landlord, 
Perfect and unharmed, and every whit as good as myself. 
The Lord advances, and ever advances. 
Always the shadow in front, 
But ever the reached hand of the Almighty, moving up ‘the 
laggards.” 
And that is not hopeless ! 
I believe there is a very wrong impression extant 
about what can be done for idiotic children in institu- 
tions which are provided for their care. Time and 
again I have heard stories about the wonderful things 
that have been done for children in these schools. But 
when I have brought these stories to the test, I have 
found that, whatever may have been the intentions of 
those who told them, they have conveyed a very wrong 
impression to the community at large. And here is the 
Teason : — 
These stories about the wonderful advancement of 
Pupils in schools for idiots (they should never be called 
institutions for the feeble-minded; such children are 
hot feeble-minded, but only bad-bodied, and so idiotic 
or peculiar), are most of them true, in away. But the 
Progress made by those children that are told about is 
never, or at least rarely, if ever, along the lines of their 
natural idiocy. 
Such children are “born short” to the extent of
-P-A-G-E-104
96 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
idiocy, on some lines, while they are born normal, or 
often “long,” sometimes to an extent little short of 
genius, on other lines. Their idiocies are so numerous 
and pronounced that they constitute the leading features 
of the children’s make-up, and so they are sent to a 
institution. Here, their “long” sides are brought to 
the front, and they are sometimes permitted to move 
out on the lines on which they can come through. This 
work on their long sides is reported, and the conclusion 
reached by the outside world is, that such children have 
been brought to the standard of normality, ail along tle 
Zine. But this is so rarely the case that it is not worth 
taking into account. 
Once in a while, as in the case of Dr. Stillman, 4 
child that is idiotic on some lines, for the time being, 
because of something that happened to him after be 
was born, may come to normality on those lines; bit 
where the child is born idiotic, there is very little prob 
ability that he will ever become normal to any gre 
degree in the places where he is “born short.” Thos 
who have had experience with such children will unati- 
mously sustain these statements, . 
This principle holds true in all cases where a child 
is really “born short,” be the shortages many or fem 
Where the shortage is genuine and congenital, it 
rarely ever overcome. Charles Sumner never attain 
to any mathematical ability. worth mentioning; 
General Grant was helpless, as a financier, to the day 
of his death. To be sure, he wrote his memoirs whél 
he was dying by inches. But others had to “finance” 
them for him. The principle stands in his case and it 
all others. It seems hard, when looked at from somé 
standpoints; but. that is neither here nor there, so {
-P-A-G-E-105
AGAIN THE BODY. - . oy 
as the facts are concerned. The question here, as 
always, is what is the truth in the premises? I firmly 
believe it will always be found just as I have stated it. 
And I am also sure that it is not nearly as bad as it 
seems, if it is only thoroughly understood, and the edu- 
cation of each child is provided for accordingly — that 
is, in harmony with the way he is, that he is brought to 
his best with what he has to do with, if his “one talent” 
is made the most of. 
And so, for you, teachers or parents who have idiotic 
children in your schools or in your families, be not cast 
down overmuch, and do not torment either yourselves 
or the children in trying to bring them to normality all 
along the line. Rather be content to take them as they 
are, and do the most you can for them along the lines of 
their possibilities. Jesus said: “Neither this man nor 
his parents sinned, but that the glory of God might be 
made manifest” ; and if you will help such children to 
Move out on the line of their native abilities, to the limit 
of their powers, you will glorify God as greatly as the 
greatest! See it that way, which is the right way, I 
believe, and be comforted, ye who are weighed down 
with this sort of burden. And there are many such. 
And if you send a child of yours to an “ institution,” 
don’t expect too much to come of it. Many people go 
broken-hearted on this score. They have heard such 
wondrous tales about what has been done for children 
who they supposed were like theirs that their hopes 
mount high as they imagine what may be done for their 
own afflicted one. And then the months go by, and 
the change they hope for comes not; whereupon they 
sink down in despair! The cause of this unfortunate 
outcome is a failure to realize the truth of what I have 
F328
-P-A-G-E-106
98 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
told in these last pages. True your hopes to the line 
of the possible in such cases, to what can be done for 
such children, they being as they are, and you will not 
then be disappointed; always remembering that there 
is small hope of making any child normally “long” 
where he is abnormally “short.” Let the educational 
work for such children be done along the lines of their 
longages, and then helpful and satisfactory results, 
viewed from that standpoint, can be obtained. 
It is further true that the more these children are suc- 
cessfully moved up along the lines of their possibilities, 
the more probability there is that they may move up, it 
some measure, along the lines of their so-far-indicated im 
possibilities. They gather strength, to a degree, all along 
the line, by the exercise of what faculties they can suc 
cessfully use. This isa point never to be forgotten 
the education of such children. But growth must come, 
if it comes at all, by starting the child along the lines it 
which he has at least some natural ability to move. If 
a start can be made there, there is hope for some prog- 
ress elsewhere. Some of these children are the most 
lovable in the world, and they are all “provided fot” 
Our duty is to do the best we can for them, they being 
what they are. They form a part of all the children of 
all the people, and as such they should be educated to 
the limit of their several possibilities.

have written thus far. For, the truth is that no one can 
honestly look these shortage facts in the face without 
having great questions rise in his mind as to the why of 
it all; and, beyond that, the outcome of it all. It is 
such considerations that sometimes force us to the verge

shall perish miserably if we have not a rock of im- 
movable faith to cling to.

Of course I hesitate to say what I am going to say, 
for reasons that you can well understand. You have 
only to think how it would be if the case were your 
own, and then you will know all about it. 
And in saying what I do I make no claim that I 
have found the absolutely immovable and fundamentally 
basic rock on which all can at once rest and be at peace. 
I may not have found such a place for any one else, not 
even for you. But of this you may be assured, I have 
found it for myself, and there is a chance that I may 
have found it for some one else—— perhaps for you 
Anyhow, I feel that the rock under my feet is broad 
enough, and solid enough, to sustain your weight 3 
well as mine, and with us the weight of all humanity, 
for all time and eternity, if once the brethren and sisters 
can settle down on such a basis. 
I cannot go into details as I should like to, but all # 
once and without apology I state that the rock I am 
based on is found in the words, ‘God made the heavens 
and the earth.” 
That sentence tells what I stand on; and, up #0 
date, nothing has been able to move me therefrom. 
accept that as the rock-bottom, St. Peter Sandstomt 
foundation that sustains me now, and that I believe 
will sustain me continually. 
For if God made the heavens and the earth, T reckon 
he has made all that has ever been made. (In anothet 
place the Book says, “ And without him was not any 
thing made that was made,” and that is a good way 
tell it.) And if God made all these, that takes in yo 
and me, and all the rest of everything everywhere 
And that is enough! 
And all the evidence I can get at goes to show tht
-P-A-G-E-109
STRICTLY BETWEEN OURSELVES or 
the Power that has made all these things (which is only 
another name for what I and many others call God), 
takes care of them, and will forever keep doing so. 
And that brings you, and me, and all the rest of every- 
thing under shelter. And, being under shelter, you, 
and I, and all the rest of everything are safe. And if 
we are all safe, that is enough! 
And so I rest secure; and so can you, and 3 30 can 
all, and everybody. ‘ 
I grant that I see a good many things about me 
which, now and then, it seems to me, might be better 
looked after. But the older I grow the fewer such 
things I see, and the better I know that even these 
things are cared for, in.a way that I once knew not of.: 
Thave had experiences in my own life, a good many of 
them, that, at the time, I thought were not looked after 
by the Power behind them as I thought they should 
have been, But the years have proved that even these 
were “provided for.” It has been the same way with 
you, has it not ? 
And so, as I look out upon the great multitudes of 
my brothers and sisters, of all classes and conditions of 
men, women, and children, all the world over, and see 
the way they are, I cannot be troubled. For I believe 
that God made them a//, and that what he has made he 
will care for, to the utmost limit. I find corroborative 
evidence of this, every way I look. The stars are cared 
for, and the stuff that the stars and all things else are 
made of is cared for, and all in between and about them 
all is cared for. And you, and I, and all the rest, are 
somewhere in between or about all these things. 
And when I see some things that seem to me not 
cared for, I have come to. understand that my reasons
-P-A-G-E-110
zo2 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
for thinking so are because I do not see far enough, ot 
deep enough, or wide enough. Then I become patient 
and “ willing to wait.” 
And this does not mean fatalism. Anything but 
that. For, in my inmost soul, I feel that if I have been 
made, I also am a maker. The Book has it that “we 
are all workers together with God,” and my experience 
teaches me that the Book is right about it. And this 
completes the circle—covers the whole ground. The 
Power that made all things works, and we work, and s 
things get on. : 
And the object of all work — God’s, yours, mint, 
everybody’s —is to make new and higher combinations 
out of things that are now combined in some other way 
than as we would henceforth have them. 
When I found that out, it made a great change in the 
way I looked at things, past, present, and to come! It 
took the edge off my blame of people and things # 
they are, and led me to see that there was a reason why, 
in every case. 
It made me understand that a great many conditiows 
should be changed, and gave me zeal to try to help 
change them, as the Great Worker is helping to change 
things, all the time, But, meantime, it filled me wit 
charity instead of hatred, and it taught me to walt 
patiently for outcomes. 
This discovery also compelled me to see that al 
change must be from something that now is into som 
thing which is yet to be; and that it is life and death 
which make such change possible — which bring such 
change about! Neither of these can do the work alone 
It always takes them both, death and life, whenevet # 
change in anything is made. And neither of the#
-P-A-G-E-111
STRICTLY BETWEEN OURSELVES 103, 
comes first in the order of their doing. They work in 
absolute unity. The only difference between them is 
that one is positive and the other negative. Life pushes, 
and death gives way ; but the push and the yielding are 
a part of one and the same single performance — of the 
change from what is into what is to be. 
When I found that out, then I saw that “death has 
just as much purport as life has,” and so I ceased to be 
any more afraid of death than of life. I also learned 
that it is not wise to pass blame upon present conditions, 
ho matter what they may be, or to waste time mourning 
over them; but that it is my business, as a positive factor 
in the problem, always to be “up and doing,” always 
busy making changes — bringing death to the unworthy 
and life to that which is better. 
And then I saw what is true for me must be true for 
tverybody else, absolutely. 
For, who am I, or who are you, that we and ours 
should be well looked after and the rest be left uncared 
for? I used to think that happiness would come if I 
and mine were specially cared for. But I was mis- 
taken! I think you will come to the same conclusion if 
you will think these things over for a while. Some one 
has said that hell is the pursuit of happiness for its own 
sake, and for one’s own selfish interest. And if only we 
and ours are cared for, that is selfishness supreme — 
that is hell at its utmost. 
No, it must be all or nothing! Some is not enough! 
And it cannot be nothing! Because, we know that we 
are cared for. And because we know that we are each 
only one in the great procession, therefore the whole 
Procession is cared for. 
And will you think for a minute what that means?
-P-A-G-E-112
104 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
Will you try to think of something that is not cared for? 
The great is cared for, and the small is cared for, and 
all in between is cared for. I have said that in another 
way, a few lines back, but it is so important that it will 
bear saying many ways, and many times. All is cared 
for, all is “ provided for.” 
And so I look upon these “shorts,” here and there— 
the shortages in myself and in all the rest I have ever 
seen, anywhere, and I realize that we are all only be 
coming. We are changing from what we now are to 
something other than we now are, That “all is in a 
procession,” and that all is going forward. Some are 
far up the line, some lag away in the rear, and there 
are crowds allin between. But all came from the same 
Source, and all move in the same direction —- forward! 
And the Maker of the procession helps us to move 
forward, and we help ourselves to move forward, and it 
is also our business to help those who are about us to 
move forward, and so we all get on. 
Here and there I see what sometimes seems to mea 
turning back, but I find that, if I can only keep such 
appearances under my eye long enough, I shall find 
that this also ultimately makes for progress. You cal 
think of a thousand such experiences in your own line 
of growth, and in the line of growth of others that you 
know about. 
And then it came to me that it doesn’t make so very 
much difference just where we are in the procession, at 
a given time; for we shall all arrive far up the line, it 
due season, and then still keep on, going up. The only 
essential thing is that we keep going. And we shall 
do that. The pace may vary, but we shall all always — 
advance!
-P-A-G-E-113
STRICTLY BETWEEN OURSELVES. . roy 
And then I thought that whoever is in advance has 
no cause to despise those who are behind, or to look 
down upon them, or to boast over his own position in 
the line. He may be glad that he has attained, but the 
sole result of his joy will be to increase his effort to help 
another to come to where he is. It will cause him to: 
count himself the servant of all in his rear, and not their 
boss. It will make him their brother and not their king. 
He will become genuinely democratic, and will: be im- _ 
bued with the true spirit of mutuainess. 
For the compelling force of monarchy is always self- 
ishness, while the animating spirit of genuine democ- 
racy is always self-sacrifice. The Power that has made 
all things, and which sustains all things, and which cares: ~ 
for all things, and which provides for all things — this 
Power is an Internal Animating Spirit and not an Ex- 
ternal Compelling Force. It has mutualness and not 
Monarchy for its essential principle. 
And then I learned to know that the fundamental law 
for each individual is that he must be permitted to go 
his own way, so long as such going does not interfere 
with any one else ; and this is only another version of 
the Golden Rule, as a moment’s reflection will show. 
All of which means that I have a right to go my own 
way,and you have an equal right to go your own way, 
so long as we harm no one else by the way we go; and 
that I have no right to compel you to go my particular 
way, neither have you a right to compel me to go your 
Particular way; neither does it become either of us to 
tmperiously declare that our way is the only way, and 
that he is anathema who says otherwise. 
I need not say that this is really the basic law of evo- 
lution, which proceeds always from the simple to the
-P-A-G-E-114
to6 = ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
complex, from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous 
and the infinitely diversified. 
And so I see a place in the procession for all the 
“longs” and a place for all the “shorts,” and I know 
that the present conditions of both are but temporary; 
that the “longs” have an endless road over which they 
can go, and that the “shorts ” have an endless road over 
which they can come; and that neither need say to the 
other, “ What doest thou?” but that, in the true spirit 
of mutualness we will all tramp on together, and keep. 
doing so. 
Then I also saw that each in his own place is sufi 
cient, and that there is small need of making compat 
sons, one to the detriment of another; but that the main 
item in the count of each is to fill his own place full to 
the utmost, his ability being what it is. 
I also saw that each has a place and a way of his own, 
and that all the experiences of life that come to any I 
dividual are for his best good; and that, sometime, each 
will come to see it that way. That what at first seems 
good may prove good altogether, and that what at first 
seems to be bad, this also will prove to be for good, it 
the long run. So I quit quarreling with the seeming 
bad, and instead, set myself to work to find out 
“What He would have this evil do for me ? 
What is its mission ? what its ministry ? 
What golden fruit lies hidden in this husk ? 
How shall it nurse my virtue, nerve my will, 
Chasten my passions, purify my love, 
And make me in some goodly sense like Him 
Who bore the cross of evil while He lived 
And hung and bled upon it when He died ?” 
And things looked differently to me after this revel* 
tion came.
-P-A-G-E-115
STRICTLY BETWEEN OURSELVES . 107 
Then it was revealed to me why it is so hard to make 
rules and regulations (laws, and courses of study) that 
shall work equally well in all parts of the procession. 
The line is so long, and there are so many kinds in it! 
And so the Power behind all has, as a matter of fact, 
made rules and regulations for each individual in es- 
pecial, to the effect that each man, woman, or child shall 
go his or her own gait, so long as such going does not in- 
terfere with the going of any one else! That is basic, and 
the true progress of each individual can come only from 
its observance. The spirit of genuine democracy, of true 
mutualness, always has regard for such law. The right 
arm of monarchy cares for it not a pin’s fee! 
The spirit that animates modern progress is grounded 
in democracy, in mutualness. The exploiting of this idea 
has been too much along monarchical lines in nearly all’ 
the ways of life. A change is bound to take place in what 
has been attained. Death will get in its work, and life 
will get in its work. The unfit and mistaken will pass 
away, and the fit and right will take their places. 
It was not till I got this view of things that I found 
anything like rest and peace. But now I can rest and 
be at peace. Not that I will sit down and do nothing, 
saying that it will all come out right, anyhow. Not 
that at all. But, knowing that I have a place in the 
Procession, and that itis my business to keep moving ; 
and seeing, too, that if I lag, I shall pay for my in- 
difference, and get prodded on; and having come to 
understand that what is true of myself is true to any- 
body else, in that we are all in the procession, and so 
are all honorable and to be wondered at— having 
leaned this, I march with my brothers and sisters, 
Proud of them all, watching with equal joy the strong

108 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
walking of those who are before me and the feeble and 
limping steps of those who may be far behind; as we all 
travel onward, forever and forever. 
Be comforted, then, my brother, my sister, whoever 
youare. Cease fretting about yourself in the procession, 
or the place occupied by those who are near and dear 
to you. If you are “long” in certain ways, be thankful 
and not proud. If you or yours are “short” (and no 
matter how “short”) in certain ways, be not ashamed or 
cast down, but make the best you can out of what you 
have; realizing that “that which fills its own period or 
place is the equal of any,” and that it is a thousand 
times better to do a simple thing well than it is to try to 
do something that is too much for you, and fail in the 
undertaking. Keep moving, keep working with God, 
and so you will keep on arriving continually. 
The fact is that the only real joy of life comes from 
working with God, and in helping to keep things moving. 
Some one has said that heaven is a constant endeavor 0a 
one’s part to help to the attainment of its possible best . 
every life form that one comes in contact with. I believe 
this is absolutely true. And I believe that, in your inmost 
soul, dear reader, my experience in this regard is yours 
All of which is strictly between ourselves. I have 
said it hesitatingly, and because J could not help saying 
it. My hope is that it may serve as a sort of confider 
tial link between us, as we pass from what I have so fat 
said into the more positive part of what I had in mind 
to say when I began writing this book. If this heart to 
heart talk between us can put us ex rapport for what all 
I have so far said leads up to, then it will have filled its 
mission, and we shall be in good shape to enter upot 
the consideration of the following chapters.

to follow. 
Now, as a matter of fact, all I have said, so far, is 
merely preliminary, a sort of preface to what I have yet 
tosay. I admit that this preface is long, for in volume 
it makes nearly one third of the book I am submitting 
to the reader; but I could not make it shorter in view of 
the importance which the base it forms bears to what 
I propose to build upon it. . 
There is many a lighthouse whose foundation is the 
chief part of the structure that shows where danger lies 
and points the way of deliverance therefrom. 
I believe that I have demonstrated that there are such 
Phenomena as are defined by the words “born short” 
and “born long,” 2 all materialized humanity, and that 
such primal characteristics have a marked tendency to 
Persist in each individual life that they are manifest in; 
and, further, that such conditions are positive factors 
that ought to be taken into account in any righteous 
effort to bring each individual to his or her possible best. 
109
-P-A-G-E-118
110 = ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
And now, since it is the avowed aim and purpose of 
all education to bring humanity, individually and cob 
lectively, to its possible best; and since, in carrying out 
such purpose it is essential that all the factors that 
have to do with the problem should be taken into ac- 
count, it is strictly logical and practical to consider the 
relation that exists between the phenomena I have put 
in the foreground and an attempt to educate all the 
children of all the people. 
These statements square us around and set our faces 
forward along the road that we shall travel for the rest 
of the journey. 
Anent which, I beg first to call the attention of the 
reader to the newness or comparative recency of any 
attempt to educate all the children of all the people. I 
am only a trifle past my threescore years, and yet my 
memory reaches back to the time when there was 10 
such possibility generally thought of in this country, 
much less attempted. I can well remember hearing 
the feasibility of such an undertaking discussed at 4 
“teachers’ meeting,” in western Massachusetts, when | 
was a boy of ten. Horace Mann was the speaker of the 
occasion, and though I was but a child when I heard him, 
he spoke so forcibly that he not only kept me awake all 
through his talk, but I remember much of what he said, 
and I shall use a part of it before I am done with this 
writing. 
About a half century, then, is the measure of all the 
time we have really been working at the problem of 
universalizing education, and that is practically but a few 
minutes in the stretch of years which it takes to fully 
universalize anything. So we must be as patient her¢ 
as we are when dealing with any other evolutionaty
-P-A-G-E-119
SOME WHYS AND WHEREFORES IIL 
process. These all work slowly and take their own time 
for effecting results. : 
Before any attempt is made to suggest what ought to 
be done in any given situation, it is not only fair, but 
absolutely essential to justice, that there should be a 
thorough and comprehensive knowledge of what the 
situation really is, and of how it came to be so. And 
so, before proceeding with any suggestions that. this 
treatise may have to make regarding our efforts to 
educate all the children of all the people, it is necessary 
that we review, quite thoroughly, the history of our _ 
attempts in that direction to date; how such attempts 
came to be made; what the conditions, intellectual, 
social, and economic, were at the time the undertaking 
began; what ideas prevailed at the outset of the attempt 
tegarding what constituted an education; what-means 
and methods were reckoned as competent to produce 
the ends aimed at; how these means and methods were 
applied, and why just these means and methods were 
used just as they were, — with some survey of the results 
all these things have produced. 
And so I shall honestly try to find out somewhere 
hear where we are in our thus-far attempts to educate 
all the children of all the people, and how we have 
come to be in our present status, before I make any 
Suggestions as to what the future may have in store for 
us by way of marvel or surprise on these counts. 
And having done so much, I hope to be able to point 
out some of the things it would seem wise to do, all 
these conditions being as they are. All of which will 
make up the sum and substance of what the following 
pages will contain.

Their Effect upon the System of Schools he Inaugurated—

Beyonp all question the attempt to educate all the 
children of all the people was grounded in a genuine 
spirit of democracy. Or, perhaps mutualness would be 
a better word to express just what the animating idea 
was that took form in the effort to universalize educ 
tion, — though I do not find that word in the dictionary. 
In any event, the movement was only one of many 
manifestations of an attempt to make general things 
which, so far in the history of the world, had been 
special ; to have all share in what, up to that time, only 
a few had been permitted to have. It was an honest 
effort to convey to the masses what had heretofore been 
the prerogative of classes only. 
The men who fathered this idea and who were the 
immediate factors in its objective embodiment were 
among the most noble souls the world has ever produced. 
Their ideals were God-born, and their efforts to realize 
them are among the highest that human endeavor has 
ever put forth. Let these facts never be forgotten, for 
they are worthy of immortal acknowledgment. 
On the other hand, experience in all lines of life 
Hz
-P-A-G-E-121
BITS OF HISTORY 413 - 
proves that the pioneers in any given enterprise seldom, 
if ever, succeed in putting into operation the best pos- 
sible methods of reaching their ideals. So many in- 
stances which go to prove the truth of this statement will 
readily occur to the reader that none need be quoted here. 
Again, it is not finding fault with pioneers, much less 
condemning them, if those who come after them ques- 
tion the wisdom of some of the primary methods used 
in their first experimentations. [We live in a world of 
Progress and not of finalities)'and this is specially 
true with regard to all means and methods: that are 
used by mankind to obtain results. These principles 
are as true in matters educational as they are elsewhere. 
I make these remarks just here because, as a matter 
of fact, conservatism is a little more pronounced in the 
educational world than in any other sphere of life that 
Uknow about, unless it be in the realm of theology. 
“Tis true, ’tis pity; pity 'tis ’tis true.” And there are 
not wanting many good men and true women who feel 
that if any move is made to change anything that ever 
has been, educationally, such effort is a slur upon the 
Past, and an attempt at defamation of the characters of 
the originators of the things whose change is afterwards 
Sought. All of which is wrong. 
Treverence the fathers of the attempt to educate all 
the children of all the people as much as any one can. 
So far as the real, essential results they desired to ac- © 
complish are concerned, there is nothing left to be 
Wished for. Their purpose was to bring every indi- 
vidual to his or her possible best. If there was a fault 
anywhere, it lay in their conception of what was the 
Possible best for each individual, and of what was the 
best way to attain such result. 
I
-P-A-G-E-122
114 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
Now, look for a moment, first at the conception of 
what constituted an education, or an educated man, asit 
obtained in the days when the idea of popular education 
first came into vogue and the first efforts were made to 
materialize that idea. 
Horace Mann may well be counted as among oneof 
the best of the fathers of the original scheme, and he 
had more to do with its early exploitation than any other 
one individual in this country. And so, in considering 
what he was, what educational ideas he held, and how 
he tried to establish ways and means that would cary 
out what he believed to be for the best in the issues at 
stake, we are studying the whole group of his coadjr 
tors; and from his single case we may practically lea 
the truth regarding all his colaborers. . 
Let no one say that I am attacking Horace Mann in 
what I am about to say. I only use his name and cite 
his work because they are especially in point, and at 
fair specimens of all the beliefs and doings of all the 
fathers of the efforts to achieve popular education. 
Horace Mann was a classically educated scholar, and 
the ideas of what constituted an educated man in the ag 
in which he lived were all of the classica! sort, as that 
word was interpreted, educationally, at that time. To 
say, then, that a man was an educated man was virtually 
to say that he was a classical college graduate. I do 
not complain of this, but I beg to call special attention 
to it as an undeniable fact, for it is the very corner stoi¢ 
of what all this is leading up to. 
Such, then, were the ideas of what constituted af 
education, and of who were educated men. 
Now there is no denying the fact (nor is it strange 
that the fact should be as it was) that, with these ideas
-P-A-G-E-123
BITS OF HISTORY . Img, 
as to what constituted an education and as to who were” 
educated men, the attempt to universalize education was 
exploited with these ideas as a basis. That is, the 
attempt, as originally made, was to classically educate all 
the children of all the people. Right there’ is the very 
beginning, the primal germ of what afterwards grew to 
be the material form of our public school system —of 
what these schools stood for, and of the particular 
nature of the output they strove to produce. It goes 
without saying that, for the most part, this original con- 
ception on these fundamental points, remains, to’ this 
day, practically where it started. none 
I well remember hearing Mr. Mann say, in the ad- 
dress I have referred to: “We will make a system’ of 
schools which will render it possible for every child, 
tich or poor, to go to college.” (The reader will recall 
the fact that I have already stated that I was “born 
long” on remembering and quoting. I would stake all 
Tam worth on the accuracy of the above quotation, 
though it is more than half a century since I heard it.) 
In that same address, the speaker went on to explain 
how they would change all the “Academies,” which 
were then very numerous all through Massachusetts and 
in some others of the Eastern and Middle States, into 
“High Schools,” which all the children should be per- 
Mitted to attend, free. He then told how all the public 
schools would have their work fashioned relative to the 
work which would later be done in these High Schools, 
so that the whole education of all the children, from 
entrance day to graduation, should be fashioned with a 
classical college education as the ultimate goal to be 
reached by all the children of all the people. 
Then he dwelt upon the result of all this, as he saw
-P-A-G-E-124
116 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
it, namely, that all these children, all uniformly educated 
as he had been educated, would be thoroughly capable 
of informing themselves well on all questions and issues 
of public importance; how judicially minded they would 
all be, because of the training they had all received in 
the higher realms of culture which all would have. had 
the benefits of, and so forth, and so following. It wasa 
glorious picture, and I well remember how my father, . 
who was an Amherst man, glowed with enthusiasm 
about it as he talked all these things over with Mr 
Mann, who took supper at our house with the minister 
and a few teacher friends after the lecture. 
IT ought to add, too, that it was because of all these 
‘great. and good civic results, which the speaker said 
would follow this universal dissemination of classical 
learning, that he claimed it was right and just to taxall 
the people for the support of the schools which were fo 
put our entire population into such prime condition for 
good citizenship. This point, I remember, he arged 
strongly, owing to the fact that it was a rural New 
England audience he was addressing, and some of his 
hearers were quite wealthy men, without children, and 
these rather objected to being taxed to pay for the edt 
cation of other people’s offspring. The whole address 
made a lasting impression upon me, as these excerpts 
duly prove. 
Now it is a matter of common knowledge te all who 
are. even fairly well posted upon the subject, that the 
lines Mr. Mann laid down, more than fifty years ago it 
that New England village, have practically been followed 
in the rise and progress of our public school systet, 
throughout this entire nation. These schools were all 
exploited upon a classical college idea of what const

BITS OF HISTORY 17, 
tutes an education, and the possible entrance to a classi-. 
cal college was made the end and aim of all the work 
that was done in them, from turret to foundation stone, 
or vice versa. As such the work of our public schools 
was fashioned, and as such it has been pursued, for the 
most part, even unto this day. 
And so it was that our public schools, all of them, 
from primary to high school, were exploited with the 
idea that their chief function was that of being classical 
“college feeders.” This was the first step in the par- 
ticular way in which the attempt to educate all the 
children of all the people was made. That it was 
honestly made there can be no doubt. That those who 
exploited the idea in this particular fashion fully be- 
lieved that the method used would yield the fruits 
Prophesied is equally certain. The whole story is only 
a bit of history that everybody should know is true.

THERE were certain other factors in the early efforts 
to educate all the children of all the people that must 
be noted just here. Among these were the generally 
accepted psychological theories of the period regarding 
the mental possibilities of humanity; and these wert 
backed up and buttressed by the basic sociological pto 
nouncement of the Declaration of Independence, which, 
as popularly translated, aided and abetted these theories 
perfectly. All these elements were unified and wovel 
together into a compact whole, and in this shape they 
were utilized as a philosophic basis for the cause of 
popular education to rest upon. 
, _ And here is how the popular argument ran: The 
Declaration of Independence asserted that all men wert 
created equal. The word “equal” meant alike—the 
dictionary said so, and a dictionary is the court from 
which there is no appeal when it comes to telling wh#t 
words mean! 
+, Then follows Locke’s tabula rasa theory, to the effect

on which can be marked whatever we wish. -. These two 
formulas were then logically joined, as follows: ‘Since 
all children are born alike, and their minds are all like 
blank sheets of paper on which we can mark whatever 
we will, it follows that all we have.to do is to mark the 
same things on all children’s minds, in exactly the same 
way, and a uniform result must be inevitable. 
Then followed another dogma which was in harmony 
with the foregoing philosophy, and which was formu- 
lated in this way: “What man has done man can do.” 
This was translated to mean that what any man ever 
had done, any other man (and, therefore, every. other 
man) could do if he tried hard enough and worked at it 
long enough. : 
(My father was anxious that I should be a good Latin 
and Greek schclar, and when I was sweating blood to 
get my lessons and keep up with my classes in these 
studies, as I have related, in response to my tearful ap- 
Peals for surcease from such sorrow, he used to say to 
me: “Persevere, Willie! Edward Everett mastered a 
score of languages, and if he did, you can. Your mind 
is just as strong as his, if you will only exercise it as he 
did. Don’t ever forget that what man has done man 
can do!” And my father is not the only man who has 
quoted this phrase under similar circumstances !) 
There is another factor that had to do with the ex- 
ploiting of this first attempt to generally disseminate 
classical college education among the masses, which has 
Not been generally recognized, but which was none the 
less potent. This is the prevalence, among all. our 
people, of the military spirit, at just the formative period 
of our public graded school system on the basis outlined 
by its founders.
-P-A-G-E-128
120 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
This formative period came just at the close of our 
Civil War. For four years our whole population had 
been soaked in militarism till its spirit had permeated 
our entire body politic. This is one of the effects of 
war which is doubtless slow in manifesting itself, but 
which is the most abiding of all the evils that lurk in its 
trail. 
The essence of the military spirit is compulsion. 
“Theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die” 
tells the whole story. 
And now see what follows, as does the night the day, 
putting all these facts and conditions together : 
The founders of our public graded school system had 
a theory for its propagation which was absolutely fault- 
less, from a logical standpoint. They were so convinced 
of its efficiency, when once it should be established, that 
they did not hesitate to guarantee the results that would 
surely follow. These results were such as the whole 
spirit of democracy had long looked forward to eagerly; 
our people were behind the purpose to a man, and what 
remained but to put it into operation? And, in the 
spirit of that age, if it was a good thing (and everybody 
believed it was), why not establish it by compulsion? 
So the attempt was made to work the plan by military 
methods and in that way to.compel its uniform accept 
ance by all the children of all the people. 
Tn accordance with such military methods and usages, 
therefore, a plan of campaign was designed and put into 
operation which was systematic in the utmost degree. 
The work to be done by each and every pupil was out- 
lined with perfect minuteness and accuracy, from enter 
ing day to graduation. This work was divided into 
regular portions and sections, and a certain amount was
-P-A-G-E-129
MORE BITS OF HISTORY 122 
to be acquired by the pupil in certain times, this allot- 
ment sometimes descending to the details of days and 
hours of the day. The plan was to enter a.class of a 
certain age in a primary grade, have them all take a 
prescribed amount of work in a definitely: fixed. time, 
and all come out, at the end of each and every term, 
possessed of exactly the same attainments. Poy 
To compel such results, in regular military fashion, 
penalties were fixed for all pupils who failed to reach 
the required standards in the times named. Several 
studies were included in each period of time, and if.a 
pupil failed to “ pass” in any one of these studies, a8 a 
penalty he was compelled to go over the work again, : 
not only in the study in which he had failed, but in.all 
the others which were included in that particular period! 
He must stay in each “grade” till a// the work of that 
gtade was well and thoroughly done, before he could be 
Permitted to proceed with any other work, further on in 
the uniform prescribed “Course of Study.” -In this 
way pupils were not infrequently kept for several terms 
in the same room, going over the same work again and 
again, until the required uniformity in all the required 
studies was reached. It was held that by this method 
only could symmetry in scholarship and character be 
attained. If pupils failed beyond a certain fixed limit, 
they were dropped out of school or expelled.: 
And the chief aim of all this work was to fit pupils to 
enter classical colleges, These institutions practically 
formulated the courses of study which all the children 
were compelled to take if they continued in the public 
Schools at all. In a word, the whole system was faced 
classical-collegeward, and it was manipulated almost 
catirely in the interest of these institutions which really
-P-A-G-E-130
122. ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
dominated all the public schools of all the people in 
this country. 
Again, the technical classroom methods that were 
used for giving pupils an education at the time the 
public schools came into being were almost entirely of 
the sort used in the days when whatever was learned 
had to be “committed to memory.” From what dim 
past this practice came can only be surmised; but it 
probably began as far back as the time when there were 
no books, when the memory was the only storehouse 
for the preservation of the record of past events and 
of. knowledge previously obtained. In any event, in the 
early days of public school exploitation the memory was 
counted as the chief factor to be utilized and cultivated 
in a// educational processes; and the selection of studies 
to be pursued and all the methods used in classrooms 
were aimed in the direction of cultivating the memory. 
As a result of this, the ability to reproduce, by the 
sole aid of memory, whatever had been once learned 
came to be the test of scholarship, and the pupil who 
could best relate or write out what his teacher bad 
asked him to “commit to memory” was counted the 
best scholar. 
To all this were added, most naturally, frequent writtet 
examination tests, in which each pupil’s work was proved 
up by his ability to reproduce, at the arm’s length of 
memory alone, any or all the things which had once beet 
given into the charge of this omnicapacious receptacle. 
And this was only in harmony with the then accepted 
psychological theories regarding the memory. 
memory was then regarded as a storehouse which would 
safely keep anything and everything that was wel 
packed into it, and it was universally held by the ped
-P-A-G-E-131
MORE BITS OF HISTORY = .->.—-323 
gogical theorists of that time that from such storehouse 
its keeper could reproduce any or all of the things com- 
mitted to it, instantly, on call. It was further held that 
the capacity of this storehouse could be increased indefi- 
nitely, in all directions, by proper exercise and training, 
and the chief end and aim of all educational methods 
was to augment its holding area and the amount of 
stuff it contained. All of which it was claimed would 
develop the individual to his possible best in every way, 
—make him a good citizen, soldier, father, or what not. 
More than this, since it was the aim of all the work 
done in all the schools through all the grades as these 
things were first formulated to finally fit all their products 
for future classical college work ; and since it was neces: 
sary, before pupils could enter such classical colleges, that 
their attainments at the time of entrance be verified; 
and since memory tests of what had been.done were the 
sole proofs relied on as evidence of proficiency in the 
attainments required, —since all these things were s0, 
the ability to stand a classical college entrance ¢xam- 
ination was made the unswerving requirement for 
graduation from a public high school. 
And all of this was only in harmony with the original 
plan, which was to make the public “high school 
take the place of the old “ Academies” (whose sole 
business it was to fit pupils for classical college entrance 
by a written memory-examination test of fitness), and to 
make all the grade schools below the high schools tribu- 
tary to this ultimate end; which same it was at first 
supposed all the children of all the people could attain 
to, according to the logic which was based on the mental 
theories of that time. Thus the whole scheme went 
together as nicely as the House that Jack Built. There
-P-A-G-E-132
124 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
is not a break in the logic of the entire process, the fun 
damental premises being admitted. 
Once more (for we must trace this thread of events 
to the very end it finally attained), the burden of 
memory-test written examinations for classical college 
entrance finally became too hard to bear, and so Mother 
Necessity went to work to find a way of escape from 
its hardships; and she found it, in the shape of “ Ac 
credited Schools,” 
Dare I pause, just here, to trace the way this came 
about? Bear with me a minute, I will be brief. 
Did you ever stop to think why it is that the last day ofa 
“year’s school work is called “ Commencement”? There's 
areason! As things used to be in classical colleges, where 
the name and custom originated, this was the day forthe 
examination of new pupils for the coming term, the el 
trance day for the.“freshman class” for the next year 
To attract as many new students as possible (for students 
had to be drummed up when there were only the tuition 
academies to furnish them) the college graduating class 
of the just-ending year was brought out and exploited 
and paraded toa degree, so that the on-coming youngsters 
might see what they themselves might some day become. 
And on this day all the xew students were examined for 
college entrance! It was a day of joy for the out-goes 
of dread for the in-comers. 
And very shrewd all this was — this examination of 
freshmen from the academies just at this time; becaus 
college commencement time came just at the time the 
academies closed their season’s work! These academy 
pupils were all fresh from the studies they had been at 
work memorizing through the previous fall, winter, and 
spring ; and the time to examine them and not have them
-P-A-G-E-133
MORE BITS OF HISTORY tas 
“flunk” was before they “got rusty’ "yh Many of our 
fathers were very wise men! 
And then, after a while, the colleges became anxious 
to draw pupils from greater distances. It costs money 
to travel far, and many pupils were too poor to make a 
special trip over a long way just to “enter college,” and 
then go back home again and wait three months when 
they must make another long journey to take up their 
college work. All of which resulted in the colleges 
delegating to certain schools the right to examine pupils 
for entrance to their institutioris and of certifying the 
same, these colleges agreeing to take such certificates in 
lieu of their own entrance examinations. This way of 
doing worked for a while, till, finally, the colleges agreed 
to take the diplomas of certain high schools as evidence 
of the fitness of the pupils who held them to enter upon 
collegiate work. 
High schools whose diplomas will be so accepted by 
colleges are now called “ Accredited Schools,” and for’ 
several years it has been the highest ambition of practi- 
cally all the high schools in this country to become 
accredited schools with as large a number of colleges 
as possible. For so are their graduates relieved from the 
terrors of a written memory-test examination of fitness to 
enter college. And the high school which can present 
the largest list of colleges which will accept its diplomas 
in lieu of entrance examination is counted the best high 
school, the country over. And that is that story. 
Then’ came the increased demands of the colleges for 
larger and more comprehensive “entrance require- 
ments.” These have been augmented, from time to 
time, till both high school teachers and pupils have been 
extra-heavily loaded by burdens they have been asked
-P-A-G-E-134
126 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
to bear for this cause. Sometimes these demands 
have been exceedingly dictatorial and exacting. It is 
only a few days since the principal of one of the best 
high schools in our state showed me a letter froma 
college which read, “If we continue longer to accept 
your diplomas as certificates for admission to our insti 
tution, you must add so and so to your course.” And 
the principal said he should have to stand for it; that 
his patrons would never permit him to lower the stand 
ard of their high school; that they were too proud to 
admit that there could be any better high school than 
theirs; that their sons and daughters must have a right 
to the best, no matter how hard it had to be worked for, 
or what conditions were made for its attainment! ; 
With which statement of facts that are almost unk 
versal in this country to-day, I close the second bit of 
history.

Sucu, then, is a brief review of what and how the at- 
tempt has been made in this country to educate all the 
children of all the people. For about half a century 
the enterprise has been exploited almost wholly on the 
original lines, and for the most part the work is still 
carried on as it was primarily undertaken. Here.and 
there, in a few large cities and in an occasional town or 
tural school, efforts have been made to improve some- 
what on the original plan; but the vast majority of our 
public schools, as they are conducted at this moment, 
are still moving on the lines of their primal projection. 
This is specially true of the schools in towns and cities 
of moderate size, those of say 5000 inhabitants or 
below. In almost every one of these the ambition still 
is to have their high school “accredited”; Latin, 
always, and sometimes Greek, ancient history, algebra, 
geometry, classical literature, and a few terms in the 
sciences, which are chiefly taught by memoriter methods 
127
-P-A-G-E-136
128 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
~~these, in the great majority of cases, constitute the 
uniform and inflexible course of study of these schools, 
and all graduates are required to qualify in these studies 
if they receive diplomas. In these schools the ruleis, 
“take these studies if you stay in school at all.” 
In saying this, I speak from a large experience which 
I have gathered from visiting schools of this class ina 
great majority of states in the Union. For the past 
fifteen years I have had occasion to travel through 
these states, and to visit cities and towns of the classes 
referred to, and wherever I have gone I have madeita 
point to visit the schools and carefully observe the work 
done in them. Add to this the fact that for the past ten 
years I have made from a dozen to twenty “ graduating 
addresses” every season, and that these have bee 
given in all parts of the country east of the Rocky 
Mountains, a fact that has put me in close touch with 
the actual output of these schools, and the reader wil 
see that I have had a good opportunity to know what 1 
am talking about. . 
Further, everywhere that I have made a graduating 
address, I have made it a point to inquire about the d 
plomas that were granted, what requirements they called 
for, and what purpose they would serve. And it bas 
been a rare thing for me to find an exception to the 
“regular rule” I have noted in this chapter. In neatly 
every case, the high school was “accredited”; the 
diploma would admit to one or more colleges, al 
diplomas were uniform, and no pupils were permit 
to graduate who had not met their requirements. 
Occasionally I have found a school where this rigorows 
method did not obtain, but such have been rare. 
recall one school, where diplomas of two or more kinds
-P-A-G-E-137
SOME RESULTS . Rag 
were awarded, one sort to the regular classical students, 
and another to those who had taken a “ mixed course.” 
In this school the students who received classical 
diplomas were dressed in cap and gown, and sat on the 
platform during the graduation exercises.. The other 
graduates were clad in their best clothes only, and sat 
at the side of the platform, apparently as a sign’ that 
they were not worthy of the high calling to which their 
classical mates had attained. I merely mention.this 
case in passing. Let the reader think of what it stands 
for, and form his own conclusions. 
As I review these various “commencements” ' which 
T have attended, and think of the size of the classes that 
have been graduated on these occasions, and compared 
these with the entering classes of which these graduates 
were a part, I have been struck, time and again, with a 
fact that is exceedingly significant when viewed from 
the standpoint of an attempt to educate all the children 
of all the people. This is what these schools have been 
honestly trying to do, and it is not unfair to look upon. 
these graduating classes as a just measure of how well 
they have succeeded in this endeavor. The original 
plan, as outlined by Horace Mann, was to have a// who 
entered these schools graduate therefrom. Because it 
Was supposed this could be done, it was claimed that it 
was right to tax all the people, that all their children 
might compass this greatly-to-be-desired accomplish- 
ment. I doubt if the classes I have seen graduate would 
average ten per cent of the enrollment of their entering 
classes in the primary rooms. And the question is, 
Where are the other ninety per cent? Why are they 
not in their places on graduation day? What is the 
cause of this great falling off in the membership of the 
K

classes as the years of school life have passed by} 
These are fair questions, and pertinent as well. 
Of course, some of each original class are dead, 
Some have moved away; but the towns in which the 
members of these classes lived have been growing towns, 
‘and where some have moved away, others have come to 
take their places, enough to make the loss from this 
cause good, if that were the real reason for the decline 
in class numbers, 
But there is no need of beating about the bush, whea 
the real reason for this decline is well known by all 
who are acquainted with the facts in the case. Tht 
simple truth is that the vast majority of the pupils who 
have dropped out of school as the years of school life 
came and went, have done so because they could no, 
or at least did not, do the work which it was required 
they should do if they stayed in school at all. At evely 
grade examination there have been numbers of failures 
to “pass,” with consequent stay-where-you-are-anddolt 
allover-again, or “demotion,” results. Some of thes 
pupils who have failed to pass stay where they ate fot 
a term or two, or a year or two, but the vast majomity 
of them drop out, and “that’s the reason,” the read reas0t, 
for the thinning ranks of classes as they go up the grades. 
Everybody knows that it is a basic truth I am telling. 
A high school principal in one of the best schools of 
this class in his state told me that for ten years a 
average of only about forty per cent of each enterilg 
class had continued till graduation day. Sixty per cett 
of the entering grammar school graduates were dow) 
and out of school before they should have been. I 
asked him if there was anything like a uniformity 
cause for this falling off at the end of the first yeah 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
SOME RESULTS cos ‘331 
and he told me that most of such pupils “ failed in Latin 
or algebra, or both!” And that is something ‘to think 
about. For I am persuaded that this principal's’ ex- 
perience is above the average, in the number of’ pupils 
he retains, for he is a most excellent teacher, one of the 
best. The fault is deeper seated than the personality 
of the teacher, however, and we all know what it is. . 
And of those who stay and go over the work. again 
and again in the grades, we all know that little good 
comes from such procedure. Such pupils wear the 
life out of their teachers and themselves, and’ all to 
small avail. One can “spot” these pupils as soon as 
oneenters any grade schoolroom in the country. They 
are several sizes too large for the seats they occupy, 
and are heads taller and pounds heavier than the chil- 
dren they have to recite with. The schools contain 
many such, “from Maine to California and from the 
Lakes to the Gulf.” Superintendent Maxwell of New 
York made a report, not long ago, to the effect. that a 
large percentage of the pupils in the schools of that 
city are from one to three grades below where they 
should be if they had kept pace with the classes in 
which they started; and since his report was made 
dumberless similar reports, from all over this country, 
Teveal the fact that his experience is not unique. 
(I have a school superintendent friend who is a good 
deal of a wag, and he said to me one day, “ The only 
sensible way to grade a school is according to size!” 
He was not wholly right, but there is much pertinency 
in his remark. Anyhow, this thing is true, that when 
there are such overgrown and over-age children, in 
any considerable number, in our schooirooms it is cer- 
tain that something is wrong somewhere.)
-P-A-G-E-140
132 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
Just what the actual conditions are, in detail, on this 
point, take the country over, it is difficult to determine 
with absolute accuracy. Reliable statistics are very 
difficult to obtain, though it would seem as though they 
ought to be easily procured. Extended and ably con 
ducted efforts have many times been made to secure 
definite data in these premises, but the results are far 
from satisfactory. Foremost among such investigations 
is that conducted by the Russell Sage Foundation, the 
results of which have been ably compiled by Leonard 
P. Ayres, A.M., under the title of “Laggards in Ow 
Schools,” a book that every teacher ought to be familiar 
with. It would be interesting to quote at length from 
this and other similar reports, but space will not permit. 
Enough to say that Mr. Ayres concludes that only about 
twelve per cent of all our children who enter the public 
schools remain in them till they are sixteen years old, 
and even this remnant is still further depleted in the 
two remaining years of public school life. 
Some fair idea of the situation can doubtless be 
gathered by noting certain facts set down in some of 
the educational reports referred to. Thus, in the Repot 
of the United States Bureau of Education on Secondary 
Schools for the year 1910, Chapter XXYV, it is stated 
that the total enrollment in all the public high schools 
of this country for the year 1909-1910 was 915,06I- 
The total number of graduates for the same year was 
. 111,363; and the total number of graduates who wert 
prepared to enter college for that. year is given as 37,811. 
I have been unable to find the total enrollment it 
all the public schools in the United States for the 
year 1909-1910, but for the year 1908-1909, it was 
17,506,175; and according to the ratio of increase it 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
SOME RESULTS 133 
previous years it is safe to say that approximately 
18,000,000 children were enrolled in all the public 
schools in this country in 1909-1910. Assuming this 
to be fairly correct, it appears that of the 18,000,000 
of children attending school on any given day of that 
year, 915,061, or about 560 in 1000, were in the high 
school; and of these, 111,363, or about 6 in 1000, of the 
entire enrollment graduated; while 37,811, or about 2 
in 1000, of the entire enrollment held diplomas which 
would entitle them to enter college. 
In the state of Illinois, conditions are considerably 
better on these points than in the country at large, as, 
indeed, they ought to be. In the report of the Educa- 
tional Department of that state for the year just noted, 
1909-1910, the entire enrollment in all the public schools 
of the state is given as 1,002,687, of which 63,392 were 
in the high schools, while 8137 graduated. Using the 
same method of comparison employed in considering all 
the schools in this country, as noted in the previous par- 
agraph, these figures mean that, in Illinois, of all'the 
pupils attending school on a given day, 63 in 1000 are 
in the high schools and 8 in 1000 graduate. 
In the city of Galesburg, Illinois, whose schools I 
shall refer to later, the entire enrollment for the year 
1909-1910 was 3814, of which 767 were in the high 
school, and 115 graduated. These figures mean that, 
on any given day, 200 pupils to each 1000 enrolled 
were in the high schools of that city; and 30 in each 
1000 enrolled graduated. Or, to put the foregoing 
figures into another form, which may make their signifi- 
cance somewhat clearer (my desire is to be perfectly fair 
in this matter) let them be looked at as follows: — 
In the regular order of the public school curriculum
-P-A-G-E-142
   
      
    
   
                334 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
the time extent of a complete course of study, from pri 
mary entrance to graduation day, occupies twelve years, 
four of which are allotted to the high school; that is 
one third of a pupil’s complete public school life is spent 
in this department; and if all the children who enter 
school were to live and complete the entire course, one 
third of the entire school enrollment would be in the 
high schools, 
But, as already noted, death and other unavoidable 
destructive forces naturally reduce the ranks of the pl 
pils as they advance through the grades, so that it is 
only just to discount the possible attendance in the four 
upper grades a decided per cent. Making such allow. 
ance, it is surely within bounds to say that at lest 
5,000,000 of the 18,000,000 children enrolled in the 
public schools should be alive and in the high schools 
if these schools had their proportionate share of the tot 
enrollment, based on the amount of time that they requit 
for their work. The statistics quoted show 915,067, # 
not quite one in five of the ultimate possibility. 
Seen from a similar viewpoint, since the high sch 
Course occupies four years, we might expect out af 4 
possible 5,000,000 high school enrollment, after making 
the required reductions, at least 1,000,000 graduates each 
year. We do have 111,363. And since almost the whole 
purpose and endeavor of the entire public school cuit 
ulum, through all the grades, is to produce gradualés 
fitted to enter college, it is surely not extravagant 
assume that a majority of those so planned for 
wrought upon should leave school so prepared —thit 
is, we ought to have at least upwards of 500,000 publi 
school graduates holding college entrance diplomas eat 
year. We do have 37,811.

The score of the State of Illinois, measured by the 
same rule, would show that, out of a total enrollment of 
1,002,687, about 200,000 ought to be in the high school, 
and the yearly graduating roll ought to be not far from 
80,000. The high schools of that state had an attend- 
ance of 63,392 and graduated 8137 in the year -1909- 
1910. 
Measured in the same way, the Galesburg, IIL, schools 
with a total enroliment of 3814 ought to have about 
1000 in the high school, and graduate about 200 each 
year. Their record for the year 1909-1910 shows 767 in 
the high school, with 115 graduates for that year... For 
the five years ending June, 1910, this school had an 
average of 125 graduates for each year. 
A comparison of these figures shows that in the matter 
of enrollment, the high schools of this country, as 4 
whole, have acquired about 20 per cent of possible effi- 
ciency, those of the State of Illinois about 35 per cent, and 
those of Galesburg, Ill, about 65 per cent. Compared 
as to output of graduates, counting those of all sorts, 
the whole country has reached a point of about 10 per 
cent of efficiency, the State of Illinois about the same, 
and the Galesburg schools about 67 per cent for the 
Past five years.’ The data furnished offer no means of 
comparing the number of college-diploma graduates in 
the different schools I have mentioned. 
Perhaps I ought to say that I have mentioned the 
Galesburg schools for two reasons: first, I happen to 
know about them; and, second, they give a practical 
demonstration of what has been attained by the applica- 
tion, in a measure at least, of the principles and methods 
advocated in this treatise, as I shall show later. Doubt- 
less there are other schools in this country that can
-P-A-G-E-144
136 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
show as good, or perhaps a better, record than this school 
presents. I hope there are many such. The thing to 
labor for is to bring all our schools to even a greater 
degree of efficiency than any have yet attained. 
Here is another significant fact, which I take from 
the United States Bureau of Education Report, before 
referred to. In Table “A” of the report, the percentage 
of pupils in public high schools preparing for college is 
given, for a term of years, namely, from 1889-1890 to 
1909-1910. This table seems to show a steady decline 
of the comparative number of students preparing for 
college, in that the percentage given for the year 1889- 
1890 is 14.44, while for the year 1909-1910 it is but 5.57. 
And the record between these two dates shows a steady 
and quite regular falling off between the two perceat 
ages quoted. That is, it would seem from these figures 
that a smaller and smaller part of all the children of all 
the people are each year preparing to enter college, and 
_ yet this diminishing factor still controls the courses of 
| study for all attendants of the public schools. 
Now I am well aware that statistics are often misleat 
ing, but it is surely fair to point out the fact that the 
figures quoted show that only a small portion of all the 
children of all the people attending school on a gived 
day are among those who complete the entire school 
course, while a much smaller portion are fitted to enter 
college. And yet the fact remains, which I have 90 
often stated, that the great bulk of the courses of study 
used in our public schools are planned, from primary 
entrance to graduation day, as if every pupil were tole 
fitted for college. There’s the rub. 
Many of my readers will shake their heads over thes¢ 
statements, and perhaps some of them will rub theif

eyes, not to say “sit up and take notice.” But I believe 
all the record I have given is practically true to present’ 
conditions, no matter what we may wish about it. Ver 
bum sat! : : 
But if one doubts what has been stated, here is _ 
another good way to prove existing conditions from 
the other end of the line, as it were, one which can. be 
easily tried by people who are curious in these affairs: 
Go through a train of cars on almost any -railroad-in. 
this country, and ask every adult passenger, man or - 
woman, “Are you a college graduate?” and see what 
per cent of affirmative answers you will get. Of course: 
the record will vary greatly in different parts of the’ 
country, and on different trains of cars. A train com- 
posed entirely of “Pullmans” would yield 2 much larger 
per cent of yes’s than would one of “day coaches” only. 
This goes without saying. But a fair average would 
not be hard to find, and such average train would yield 
results that would be quite directly in point. 
Or, go along any city street that is a thoroughfare 
for all sorts and conditions of men and women, such as 
Broadway, New York; Washington Street, Boston, or 
State Street, Chicago, and ask every adult person who 
passes you in a “rush hour,” the question noted in the 
Previous paragraph, and see what per cent of affirma- 
tive answers you will get. To be sure, such a proof 
would not be wholly satisfactory, but it would certainly 
be a significant “ pointer.” 
Not to push the proofs further, it is evident to all 
thoughtful people that only a very small percentage of 
all the children of all the people ever graduate from 
college ; and it is equally clear that it is not fair to hold 
up to college-entrance requirements all the children who
-P-A-G-E-146
138 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
never will even enter one of these institutions, for the 
sake of those who do or can use such educational ways 
and means. This is the crux of the whole situation. 
And so it turns out that, if the classical idea of what 
constitutes an educated man is to prevail as a test of 
what our public schools have so far done, our attempts 
to educate all the children of all the people have not 
yielded, so far, the results its promoters hoped for, 
planned for, and honestly expected. That is certainly 
not an extravagant statement to make at the end of our 
fifty years of trial of the means and methods we have 
used for that period of time. This is a matter of com 
mon knowledge, and it is only a truism to make the 
remark. Yet it needs to be made.

Grounds for Criticism studied — Chief Causes of Failure stated — 
Personal Equation neglected — Uniform Methods not suited to 
Wide-varying Conditions — New Factors in the Modern Educa- 
tional Problem — Machinery —- Scientific Thought — Democracy

“Born Short” under these Conditions. 
Criticism is never a pleasant task, and that is doubly 
the case when a popular idea or institution is brought 
into question. The public school system of this country 
has been, and is, exceedingly popular among nearly all 
classes of our people, and to put an interrogation mark 
before any of its ways is really an act to be shunned if it 
could rightly be avoided, But what I have shown in 
the foregoing pages is evidence that I have not orig- 
inated, and that I am not responsible for. If that evi- 
dence reveals the fact that our public schools are not 
doing what it was supposed and promised they would 
do; if they are not educating all the children of all the 
people as it was declared they would when all the people 
consented to be taxed for their support, — then it is only 
just to urge that they “make good,” and to inquire 
wherein and why they have failed to reach the high 
mark they were set to attain. 
Now, in view of what has been said up to this line, 
it must be very evident as to where some of the 
139
-P-A-G-E-148
140 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
trouble lies. My belief is that the chief cause of the 
inability to show results commensurate with the hopes of 
those who exploited the plan of universalizing education 
‘in this country lies in the failure of the founders of the 
public school system to realize the natures and kinds of 
material they had to deal with in their undertaking. 
Their theories regarding the possibilities of the human 
mind, as it is embodied in different individual men, 
women, and children, did not tally with the facts in the 
case. Practically, they made no allowance for the per 
sonal equation in the problem — an item which must be 
reckoned with by any system or device that attempts to 
deal with individual humanity. They took no account of 
the “short” and “long” qualities embodied in the chil 
dren whose development they undertook to manage, factors 
which form the chief attributes that must be considered 
in any successful attempt to bring individuals to theit 
possible best. These fundamental elements, in all chi 
aren, were denied or ignored, almost absolutely, in the 
original fashioning of our public school system. 
Again, the matter to be taught and the methods of 
teaching the same that were utilized as a means of edu 
cating all the children of all the people were never 
designed for, or suited to, any such general and wide- 
spread purpose. Both were originally planned and e* 
ploited to fit a few of the children of a few of the people 
for a few stations of life. The whole appliance was 
primarily worked out to suit the needs of certain classes 
of people, whose best interests were served thereby; 
_ and it was assumed that this same appliance would meet 
the multitudinous wants of the masses of children and 
people such as our country now has. That is, a special 
appliance was used to achieve a universal result, and tht
-P-A-G-E-149
WHAT IS WRONG IN ALL THIS? «3: 14x 
machine was not able to produce the output required 
of it. 
If this assertion needs detailed corroboration, be it 
said that the chief function of the system‘of education 
which was fastened upon the public schools. of.’ thi 
country was originally intended to make book-learne 
men—clergymen, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and. ¢_ 
give a scholarly adornment to the sons:of. gentlemen 
who had money enough so that they would never have 
to carn anything more, surely not by the work of their 
own hands. The system grew up and was developed 
across the water. In process of time it was duly.im- 
ported and established in this country through the media 
of the classical colleges which were founded here to prop- 
agate the cult from which they sprung. These are brief 
and truthful statements of well-known facts. Is it any 
wonder that the denouement proved that the means 
adopted were inadequate to the ends to be attained? 
Again, since the inauguration of the methods used i in 
our public schools, three important factors have come 
into our national life, social, mental, and political, which 
were wholly unknown when the system was originally 
set up. These are the universal use of machinery, the 
positive revelations of modern science, and.a conglom- 
erate democracy such as the world never before saw. 
Any one of these three might well overthrow all previous 
conditions of human life and its environment, What 
this potent trinity, taken together, has done, and what 
their combined product renders needful to be done to- 
day, is almost beyond computation. It is only a truism 
to say that these three forces are the chief constituents 
in the lives of all our people, individually and collec- 
tively, at this moment. Indeed, they are so important
-P-A-G-E-150
142 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
that a brief review of their relation to modern life and 
education must be given here and now. 
As to machinery, it has revolutionized the domestic 
life of all our people. On the feminine side see what 
it has done within the memory of one no older than I 
am. My grandmother sheared sheep, carded wool, spun 
yarn, wove cloth. My mother could spin and knit. My 
wife can crochet; and if I had a daughter, it is hard to 
say what she might or might not be able to do. Noone 
is to blame for this condition of affairs, which is as true of 
most families in this country to-day as it is of mine. My 
mother earned a living by selling the product of her 
own hands made under her own father’s roof tree. 
Should her granddaughter be required to support her- 
self, she could only do so by going out of her home and 
into the highways of life. Machinery has made these 
changed conditions for all the feminine part of our pop 
ulation that must needs work for a living. I am not 
complaining of this, but I am emphasizing the fact that 
these new conditions that confront one half of our pop! 
lation cannot be ignored by any system whose business 
it is to fit this part of our community for life, to bring 
its constituency to its possible best. 
And on the masculine side of the issue, the changes 
which machinery has wrought in the last fifty years 
are equally in evidence and potent. My father reaped 
grain with a sickle such as Joseph’s brethren used when 
that young dreamer went out into the fields to give them 
a message. His grandson can sit on a “ harvester” and 
reap and bind more grain in one hour than his progent 
tor could so dispose of in two days of hard work. This 
one instance tells what might be extended into volumes. 
And it all means that the young men of to-day are
-P-A-G-E-151
WHAT IS WRONG IN ALL THIS? = 143 
circumstanced not at all as were the young: men of the 
time when our public schools came into being, and for: 
whose needs they were fashioned. Our whole industrial 
life, for both male and female, has been changed by 
machinery; and the educational needs of. our people, 
especially our young people, have changed accordingly. 
The original plan for educating children in our public 
schools knew next to nothing of the industrial conditions 
that obtain to-day, nor was it fashioned to meet anys such 
requirements. That is the first story. 
Again: Modern scientific thought, which has: ‘come 
into vogue since I was a boy, has wholly changed the 
mental status of our entire population.. Never before 
have so many people thought for themselves as now.in 
our country. The unyielding relations of cause.and 
effect were never so generally recognized as they are 
today. All these new elements and forces in life are 
exploited and scattered broadcast among our people as © 
never before by books, magazines, and newspapers, 
which fill the homes of our people to the utmost limit 
of our domain. The result is that dicta and dogma that 
were once accepted without a question are now chal- 
lenged on every hand, and are asked to give reasons 
for what they assert, ‘This is a condition that power- 
fully affects our mental status. And yet its possibility 
never entered the minds of the original promoters of 
our public schools. They made no provision for it, and 
that they did not must be considered in the formation of 
any scheme that aims to bring every individual in our 
country to his or her possible best. 
Again: All this new order of things, industrial and 
mental, has been hurled bodily upon such a mixed-up 
mass of humanity as our world never till now saw gath-
-P-A-G-E-152
144 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
ered together into one place. The heterogeneity of the 
population in this country is absolutely unique. Our 
fathers never dreamed that it ever could be what it now 
is. Our citizenship is composed of people who have 
come from all nations of the earth. It represents 
every language, religion, custom, idea of right and 
wrong, political faith, that the sun has ever looked down 
upon. We have nearly a hundred millions of these 
people under our flag to-day ; they are red, white, black, 
yellow, and mixed, and we are trying to run the whole 
outfit on a New England “town meeting” plan. 
All these conditions are new and they have forced 
new problems upon us as a nation, which we are com 
pelled to solve or to suffer for not doing so. And it 
the solution of such problems, there is no single agency 
which is as potent as that of the education of all the 
children of all these people, whose well-being is involved 
in the premises, For all these varieties of people have 
children, each after its own kind, and it is the educa 
tion of all these children of all these people that we have 
undertaken, and it is proving to be no easy task. 
Once more: The enlarged fields of knowledge which 
modern research and discovery have so recently devel 
oped renders it entirely impossible for single individuals 
to do what they easily did a few years ago. When my 
father left college, he knew about all that was taught in 
the institution where he had studied. Latin, Greek, 
some mathematics, a little philosophy, and considerable 
history — these made up the whole curriculum that any 
scholar was asked to master in those days. One unifort 
diploma served for all the graduates from any of 
classical colleges in this country at that time, and that 
was a good deal less than one hundred years ago.
-P-A-G-E-153
WHAT IS WRONG IN ALL THIS? “145 
But to-day? Our Illinois State University advertises 
five hundred possible courses of study in its curricula. 
It would take a student a hundred years to master all 
the studies taught in this single institution. And what 
is true of this great school is equally true of scores of 
similar institutions all over this country. “No such con- 
dition existed when our public schools were founded, and 
no provision was made for such a situation. . 
And yet, for the most part, as I have more than once 
temarked, our public schools are now working on ptac- 
tically the same lines on which they were first projected. 
Nearly all our colleges still demand Latin as an entrance 
tequirement, and all accredited high schools are thereby 
compelled to make this study a chief item in their cur- 
ticula. The result is that the great bulk of the grade work 
done below the high school is still forced to be fashioned 
as tributary to a classical college entrance requirement, 
as originally proposed; and if pupils stay in the grades 
or in the high schools at all, they are compelled to do 
just this work or none. If they are “born short” on 
these lines, if they are unable to function mentally as 
the curriculum demands they must, they are dropped out 
of the schools that all the people pay for, and are thus 
left wholly unprovided for by the institution that was 
inaugurated for the benefit of all, and not for the needs 
ofaselect few. These are facts that we are all familiar 
with, and they embody some of the things that are posi- 
tively wrong in the present status of our public school 
system. They show in a most pronounced way why it 
is that our schools do not now educate all the children 
of all the people. ,
-P-A-G-E-154
CHAPTER XVII 
CAN ANYTHING BE DONE TO HELP THESE MATTERS? 
No Wholesale Answer possible — Due Credit given for what Schools 
have done — “Class” Tendency in High Schools — Adaptation 
the Great Lack in Present System — Former Psychology should 
be revised Pedagogic Methods need Modification — College 
Methods of Adaptation should be extended to All Grades of Pub- 
lic Schools — The Use of Books — Heads and Hands—“The 
Schools for the Children, not the Children for the Schools.” 
In attempting’ to answer the question which forms 
the caption to this chapter, let it be said at the outset 
that no complete and wholesale reply can be given, here 
or anywhere else, that will fully meet all the require: 
ments in the case. The issue is too large to be settled 
immediately and right out of hand. But I believe some 
suggestions can be made that will help the situation 
considerably. And that is something. 
But before making suggestions, I wish to say that! 
believe I fully appreciate all that our public schools 
have done for the children of this country, and I want 
to give them full credit for all they have accomplished. 
In some ways, there is no limit to the benefit they havé 
been to our whole community. They have taught 
untold thousands of foreign children how to speah 
read, and write the English language with a consié 
erable degree of accuracy. By mingling all classes 
ff our children together in the same schoolrooms they 
tave fostered a spirit of genuine democracy that ha 
Jeen of the greatest value as a social equalizer among 
146
-P-A-G-E-155
CAN ANYTHING HELP THESE MATTERS? 147 
our people. I believe it is on this count that our schools 
have been of more value to us as a nation than in any 
other one way. The great bulk of all the children of 
all our people have been closely associated: together for 
a more or less extended period of their lives, in: our 
public schools. They have worked together, played 
together, sung together, quarreled some, fought.a little, 
loved much, and formed associations which ‘have been 
of great benefit to all parties concerned. “Al: of which 
is for the best. 
These things are specially true of the lower grades of 
our schools. As the pupils have advanced in the ranks 
of school life the “class” tendency has become more 
and more in evidence ; and this is specially true of the 
high schools, where, particularly in late years, the aping 
of college ways has done much to create social divisions 
among the students, —a condition which surely is not for the best. Still, these are minor matters, and if only 
all the children could be kept in the schools, such things 
would be but trifles. I merely note them in passing. 
Be it said, then, that before any great change can 
come which will result in a more perfect adaptation of 
the work done in our public schools to the needs of all 
the children who ought to attend them, we shall have 
to have, first, and above all else, a revision of the psy- 
chology that the founders of these schools held; and 
also a great change in the pedagogical methods which 
these men inaugurated and established in our public 
schools. We also shall have to change the popular idea 
of what an education is; of what constitutes an edu- 
cated man; of what the purpose of education really is, 
and of what it will do for individual children. All of 
these changes in the present order will surely have to
-P-A-G-E-156
148 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
be made before our schools can redeem the promise 
of their founders, and fulfill the hopes of those who: 
sustain them. Something of what form these changes 
may take, as time goes on, I venture to predict, as 
follows : — 
In the first place, I am very sure that, gradually, our 
public school teachers, of all classes, will come to 
recognize the truth of the “born short” and “born long” 
psychological theory; and that, in the not distant future, 
they will begin to modify their demands upon theit 
pupils accordingly, This means that a single and uni 
form curriculum, which extends from primary entrance 
to graduation day in the high school, the same for each 
and every pupil, no matter what his or her natural abil 
ties may be —a course of study which, from start to 
finish, has for its chief end and aim the fitting of the 
pupil to enter a classical college —that such a method 
of procedure will one day be a thing of the past, # 
having been thoroughly tried and found to be, for the 
most part, wanting. In any event, this system ba 
ignominiously failed to educate all the children of al 
the people, —to deliver the goods it bargained to tum 
over to those who paid the bills. 
My chief reason for this belief lies in the fact thi 
our colleges and higher institutions of learning have all 
come to recognize this primal psychological fact af 
“shorts” and “longs,” of the variability in. the mental 
functioning power of their students, and have fashioned 
their curricula accordingly. I do not know of any hight! 
institution of learning, anywhere in this country, whi 
now limits its students to a single course of study and 
issues only one form of diploma. The “elective” prit 
ciple has become universal among all these institutions
-P-A-G-E-157
CAN ANYTHING HELP THESE MATTERS? ~ 149 
Not one of them could long exist if it abandoned such 
method and practice. They grew into this condition 
slowly. The most conservative of them rebelled against 
it to the utmost. But they have all finally had to “come 
to the scratch,” —to accept the inevitable.: They have 
done this loyally, in most cases—when they had to. 
There have been some blunders, not a few mistakes, 
and occasional failures in what has been. done; but on 
the whole the psychology which is grounded. ‘in .the 
“born short” and “born long” idea, and the means 
and methods thereby required, have come to the fore, 
snd they are here to stay. 
Is it not manifest to all thoughtful people that i in- 
evitably the same principles and methods which have 
won out in our higher educational institutions must be 
applied in all the educational work that is done in 
all the educational institutions of this country? This 
question will call forth a storm of protest from many of 
my readers, just as the first declaration of the doctrine 
of individual aptitude as a factor in educational possibili- 
ties roused almost a rebellion in classical college circles. 
Staid professors in these institutions raved against the 
heresy, and set their faces like a flint against the theory. 
But it was all of no avail. The same thing will one day 
happen in our public schools. For truth is mighty, and 
it will prevail. It takes time for it to arrive, but it will 
one day reach the goal that is named and that cannot 
be countermanded. 
The details of how all this can be worked out, no one 
can now give. I shall try to outline a few of these in 
later chapters; but, for the most part, their full elabo- 
tation will have to be the work of years of careful exper- 
imentation and of scientific research. .
-P-A-G-E-158
150 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
  Again: Our present schoolroom methods, of making 
memory the chief factor in the acquirement of an edu . 
cation will be abandoned, for the most part, in the new 
order of things and as time goes on. As I have already 
said, all this way of working came from a time when 
there were no books. Mow we have books, plenty of 
them. The thing to do in this new order of things is 
to teach our children how to use books, instead of trying 
to make walking encyclopedias of them. But more of 
this later on. 
Again (and this will be harder to achieve than the 
two changes I have just mentioned, because it involves 
so many people), we shall have to change the popular 
idea, which is now deeply seated in the minds of nearly 
all our citizens, as to what education really is; what 
constitutes an educated man; what education is fo, 
essentially; and what it will do for each individ 
child. These necessary changes are of the greatest im 
portance, and I shall discuss them at length in follow 
ing chapters, in the order in which they are here stated. 
Finally, we shall have to introduce methods into out 
school work which will train Zazds as well as Heads 
And because the great bulk of our children must live by 
the work of their hands, by the same token a very large 
part of the education and discipline we give them will 
such as will enable them to do their work well, whatevél 
it may be. / 
In a word, as I said in another book, long ago, “¥é 
shall make our schools fit our children instead of trying 
to make our children fit our schools.” We shall establish 
ways and means in our schoolrooms which, becaus 
of their perfect adaptation to the needs of all the chil 
dren of all our people, will keep all these children in of
-P-A-G-E-159
CAN ANYTHING HELP THESE MATTERS? I5t 
schools through all the period of their school-day years ; 
and we shall stop throwing the great bulk of our chil- 
dren out of the schools which all the peoplée pay for, 
because they cannot conform to classical college entrance 
requirements.

CHAPTER XVIII 
THE LAW OF THE INDIVIDUAL 
The Inalienable Right educationally stated — How it can obtain in 
the Public Schools — School Master and School Zacher — Logic 
and Love — Superintendents and Principals — Grades and their 
Modifications — Force and Punishments — “ Survival of the Fit 
test” vs. “Feed My Lambs”—The Boss vs. the Leader— 
Democracy and the “ Square Deal.” 
OF course, the fundamental thing I am standing for 
in the position I have taken is the ultimate right in the 
premises of each individual human being. What such 
right is can best be estimated by considering the primal 
and final law of individual human life, in all social rela 
tions. This law is as follows: Each and every individual 
human being, anywhere and everywhere, in all the world, 
hoe on inalienable right to do what and how he will, 9 
as such doing does not interfere with what somé 
2lse, who has the same inalienable rights, does, of 
wishes to have the opportunity for doing. That is, 00 
one has any right to compel me to do this or that, simply 
because he wishes me to, or has the power to force me 
to. All of which means that, in the development of 
myself by means of the educational processes that at 
brought to bear upon me, the first items to be looked 
after are my nature, my needs, my possibilities, and ## 
what will please somebody else, causing me to conform 
to a mold I was never made to fill, to be fashioned into 
something I was never designed to be. And what is 
152
-P-A-G-E-161
THE LAW OF THE INDIVIDUAL 153 
right for me, by the law of the individual is right for all 
my brothers and sisters, everywhere and always. Our 
Father in Heaven has no pets. 
So then the supreme question, so far as ‘this: treatise 
is concerned, propounds itself in this way. Is it possible 
to exploit our public schools upon the basis here out- 
lined, this law of the individual; and, if so; how can it be 
done? I firmly believe such a consummation can be 
reached ; indeed, that it must be reached, if our schools 
are to become a permanent factor in civilization, as I feel 
sure they are. How it can be done it is not so easy. to 
tell. But I venture to prophesy a little, again, as fol- - 
lows : — 
In the first place, the predominating spirit which now 
is to the fore in the management of these schools must 
be changed. This spirit is now supremely manifest in 
the word “schoolaaster,” which we have inherited from 
Monarchy, and which has its root deep down in selfish- 
hess, (I saw Head Master printed on a public school 
Toom door, only a few days ago.) 
Now this term “schoolmaster,” and the spirit it implies, 
must give place to the term “school éeacher” and the spirit 
it implies; and there is all the difference in the world 
between the two. The one means command, the other 
means service. The one says: “I am here to make the 
child do so and so, and he has got to do it, or go.” The 
other says: “I am here to help the child come to the best 
there is in himself, he being what he is.” 
The one says: “No matter what form a given child 
is intended to develop into, or what original abilities he 
may have; if he comes here to stay, he has got to be 
formed as I and the system determine, and we will com. | 
pel him to go out fashioned from a common model.”
-P-A-G-E-162
154 ALL. THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
The other says: “It is my business to try to find out, 
and to try to help each pupil to find out, what he is best 
fitted for; what his or her limitations and possibilities 
are, and how best these latter can be developed; and if 
we fail to come at this the first time trying, we are to 
keep trying again, in other ways, till we do find what is 
best, and then do this in the best way we can.” The 
one holds that the children are made for the schools. 
The other holds that the schools are constantly to be 
made to suit the every need of all the children of all the 
people. 
The one has ever in mind an unyielding System, and 
strives, above everything else, to see that it is rigidly 
enforced. The other has ever in mind the individ 
ual child, and stands ready to warp or discard any oF 
all preconceived systems and theories that, experience 
proves, hinder that particular child in its natural develop- 
ment. 
The one has a psychological theory which declares 
that the minds of children are like pieces of white paper 
on which can be marked whatever we will; the other, 
that each and every child is born with a mind of its 
own, and with capabilities that are limited in certain 
directions by its body, and that these things must be 
taken into account in the education of this particular 
child. 
The one declares that any man can do whatever he 
wills to do, regardless of conditions. The other ac 
knowledges that, so far as this world is concerned at 
least, we are finite beings. 
The one makes distinctions, and says that the se 
called best people should go to the fore and should com 
mand all the rest. The other is anxious to help keep

the whole procession moving, and that each 
only one of the crowd. 
The one favors classes, the other is for ‘thé masses j 
one is for some, the other is for all. The’ 
archical, from start to finish. The other 
democratic, viewed from any and all point 
is military, the other is civil. The one coerces," the 
other leads. The one looks down upon th children, : 
the other loves them. 
Now all this does not mean that the teacher is 
slave of the child, that children are to come to 
when they happen to be pleased to do so, and ‘go.wi 
they like, and do just as they have a mind to.’ 
they are there. Logic may put it that way; but 
the dogmatic sort, has little to do just here.  Itis: love. 
we pet logic that shows the way in all the higher ‘walks 
ot life. 
Will there be superintendents in the new order’ of ; 
things; and will there be principals? Most assurédly. 
The only difference will be in the mental and’ spiritual 
attitude of these functionaries. Instead of their chief 
aim being to command, it will be to serve. The ever 
uppermost question with each such official will be: How 
can I best serve, how best promote the success and wel- 
fare of the teachers and pupils which are committed to. 
my care? There are such superintendents and princi- 
pals now at work in our public schools —a good many 
such. But we must all admit that there are others, and 
that they are not all that way. Our aim must be to 
make that kind as numerous as possible. 
Will there be grades? There will be children in each 
school, and in each room of every school, who are so 
Much alike that, on some point or points, they can be 
       
   
   
   
   
-P-A-G-E-164
: 136 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
successfully taught together in a class. But it will not 
follow that all the children who are taught together in 
any one class will necessarily all be taught together in 
any other class, much less in all other classes. There is 
where all the trouble has come in our graded school 
work, as thus far done; and, this evil eliminated, nearly 
every other wrong or mistake connected with our public 
schools will disappear. If the law of the individud 
can be faithfully observed, not to the letter, but “in 
spirit and in truth,” there can be no doubt that these 
schools will have gone a long way towards success 
fully fulfilling the mission whereunto they were givel 
being. 
Will there, then, be no compulsion, no punishment, 
no exactions, no force? 
There will be restraint for the wrongdoers— for those 
who interfere with others by their acts. There will bt 
consequences, such as must ever result from mistakes 
and blunders, and from deliberate transgression. There 
will be positive requirements that each keep in his ow 
place without detriment to any of the others. There 
will be the exercise of force wherever such is required 
to maintain the law of the individual, never otherwise 
(There may be corporal punishment, even of a very & 
vere sort, for those who are only far enough along ™ 
the procession to understand the language of bodily su 
fering; but this means will never be used for its ow 
sake.) 
And this does not mean anarchy, or chaos, by ay 
manner of means. It simply stands for the establish 
ment of the schools upon a basis of love for all, it 
stead of favors to a few; of justice instead of partiality; 
upon the spiritual plane instead of the material plane:
-P-A-G-E-165
THE LAW OF THE INDIVIDUAL... 157 
upon the principle embodied in the words: ‘feed my 
lambs” and ‘one of the least of these. my. brethren,” 
and not upon “the survival of the fittest,” as that 
phrase is generally translated and understood--namely, 
that the brutally strongest have a right.to crush and 
annihilate everything and everybody that their unfeel- 
ing power can overcome and put under their feet. The 
whole change is from a lower to a higher plane, from 
the material to the spiritual; and that way all life is 
working. So, some day, this order of things: in. our 
schools must come. ‘ 
So again I say, the purpose of all work is to change 
conditions, and a change in conditions always means the 
passing of what is and the establishment in its place of 
what is to be. You and I are the workers in this. par- 
ticular case of our public schools, and we must work for 
a change of conditions in these schools that shall cause 
them to harmonize with the law of the individual, and 
not leave them under the domination of a system that 
cares more for itself and its own perpetuity than for the 
children whom it is set to care for. There is the issue, 
clear and undisguised. The old must go, the new must 
come, and you and I must work to bring this consum- 
tation about. 
And, in doing this, we will not rail at, or blame, or 
curse what has been, or what is. “All these things 
must needs come to pass.” But they have come gnly 
that they might pass, and to “prepare the soil for su- 
perior growths.” And so you and I will plant, for these 
superior growths in our public schools, the seeds of the 
law of the individual, which, sprouting and growing up, 
will, in time, root out the law of the boss, which has had 
its day, and so must go under. This is what the live

teacher of to-day must stand for, if he would fill to the 
full his place in the procession that goes towards that 
which is great. In our schools, as everywhere else in 
our democracy, we must give every individual “a square 
deal.”

WHAT IS EDUCATION? WHO ARE EDUCATED MEN? 
Inherited Beliefs —The Common Answer to these’ Questions — 
The College-bred only counted as Educated — Criticism: of' this 
Definition — Lincoln and his Cabinet— Bill Nye‘on-Lincoln— 
Definition of the really Educated Man— Proofs offered — Night 
Ride with “Old Mike ” — «Onto his Job” — Application of this _ 
Measure of Men — Whitman on Work and the “ Loving L °   
I Have said that one of the most difficult points to. 
overcome in this problem of the education of vall the 
children of all the people, isthe deep-seated wrong idea 
that nearly all our citizens have, as to what education 
teally is, and as to who really are truly educated men. 
These ideas, so generally held, have their roots in the 
far past. What they are, we have only to look into 
our inherited beliefs to find out and appreciate. 
Thus, what do you, dear reader, think education is? 
Have you ever defined this to yourself, or have you 
merely taken somebody else’s opinion about it? In 
either case, put it to yourself now, and see what your 
reply will be. 
Of what do you think an education consists? Whom 
do you consider an educated person? 
Regardless of what your answer may be, I believe 
that, if the average man or woman one meets in the street 
should be stopped and asked, “Whom do you consider an 
educated person ?” the answer would be practically this : 
“An educated person is one who hasa large and extended 
acquaintance with, and memory knowledge of, books.” 
159
-P-A-G-E-168
160 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
I do not say that is the definition you who are reading 
these lines would give, but I firmly believe that is the 
answer you would get from the average man or woman, 
anywhere in this country, and the chances are it is your 
inherited conviction. And this is only another way of 
saying that it is the popular idea, the idea that is gener- 
ally held by our people. 
And if this same average individual were asked to point 
out some one or more whom he considered as educated, 
he would undoubtedly name some clergyman, lawyer, 
doctor, school teacher—in a word, some book-profes 
sional man or woman. 
-Now I am not saying that he would not be right in 
this, in a way. I am not saying that book-professional 
people are not educated people. But I want tosay, and 
say it large, so that “anybody, anywheres, can under- 
stand it,” as poor little Joe has it, that these book-pto- 
fessional people, educated though they may be, are by 
no means the only educated people in the world. That 
is the point that I want to make, and make strong. 
Nor would the one who made the supposed answer I 
have noted be at all to blame for his reply. He would 
only be voicing the general idea of the age regarding 
education and educated men and women. If he had i wished to tell it all in a word, he might have said a 
college-bred man is an educated person. That is the 
common idea, and there are the best of reasons for its 
being so. -All the training of all the schools, for cet 
turies, has tended to develop such a definition; and the 
great bulk of the men and women who wish to be 
counted as educated, have insisted on such a conclusion 
being drawn. So it is perfectly natural that things 
should be as they are in this respect.
-P-A-G-E-169
WHAT IS EDUCATION?” 36n 
  Nor is this altogether ill. The only trouble: ‘about it 
is, that this view of the case is not broad ‘ ‘enough. Tis: 
too exclusive. It shuts too few in and too many out. 
It means some and not all. The idea expressed in such 
a definition is, that these and these only. are educated 
people. There is the trouble. 
Only college-bred people educated people? Think, 
now! Think of the truly great and noblemen ‘and 
women you have known. Think of those’you have 
been acquainted with who have lived successful lives, 
who have been a blessing to themselves and to alt their . 
fellow men with whom they have come in contact; who: 
have done things and have known about things ob, 
about so many things! Maybe the things they knew 
about were not set down in books, Perhaps some of 
these people knew very little about books, one way or 
another. But they knew things. They did things. 
And by all true tests they were educated people. 
Asa matter of fact, Mr. Lincoln was not very book- 
wise. The range of his reading was very limited. He 
surely never went to college. But who shall dare say 
that Abraham Lincoln was not an educated 
Why, this great saved nation of ours, to-day tells 
a wonderfully educated man he was. Yet the ¢ 
bred men of his cabinet, and their likes all over the 
country, feared that he would ‘ail because of his lack of. 
education! Two college-bred wembers of his cabinet | 
wrote him a letter, before he hadabeen president three 
months, in which they virtually told’ him that, on account 
of his lack of educational training, it was evident to | 
them that he was unequal to the task of being President 
of the United States; and that, if he would tum the 
affairs of state over to them, they would take care. of 
M
-P-A-G-E-170
Y 362 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
them as they ought to be taken care of, while he might 
appoint the postmasters and hobnob with professional 
politicians! Fact! 
Nor were the men who wrote this letter sinners above 
all others. They only voiced the sentiments of book- 
professional men, the country over, at that time. Bill 
Nye put the situation very graphically when he wrote in 
his “ History of the United States,” ‘“ Cultured society 
was continually having cold chills run up its spine, for 
fear Mr. Lincoln would put sugar and cream in his cold 
consommé!” The current idea was that the President 
could not be an educated man because he had never 
had a chance to avail himself of what was then popularly 
supposed to be the only means of acquiring an education. 
And again I must insist, lest I be wholly misunder- 
stood, that, in saying all this, I am not saying one word 
against colleges, or college-bred men and women #8 
such, or against the kind of education that such instite 
tions and such men and women stand for. The only 
point I wish to make is, that these people, these in 
stitutions, are not a// there zs in the premises. They 
are not “the only.” There are others; and they, to 
must be counted in, in any true and comprehensive def- 
nition of what an education is, or of who are educated 
men and women. 
If I should be asked whom I count as educated pet 
sons I should reply: “All persons are educated wh0 
have so developed the powers and abilities that ae 
within them, individually, that they can each do well 
the things they undertake to do.” That, to me, is the 
real test of any person’s educational attainments, Itis 
not a matter of diplomas, it is not a matter of how of 
where one has reached such a condition; it is a matte
-P-A-G-E-171

of what that condition really is. . The proof lies.:in 
ability to do and not in what one is supposed to’be able 
todo. It shows itself in what can come out: of ‘an in- 
dividual and not what is alleged to have been Pat into 
him. 
I gave this definition some years ago i ein an audé- 
ence, and it afterward elicited a remark. from one of 
my hearers that I must note just here. 9 cs’. 
The night before, I had spoken in another ‘rin some 
hundred and fifty miles from where I was then speaking. 
As trains then ran, I had to make a night ride/hetween 
the two towns. It was something past midnight when 
I went down to the station to board the train.. The 
town was a division station on the road, and the: train 
was already in the yard and undergoing the necessary 
refurnishings, as I came up. 
Now it happened that the ’bus from which I alighted 
set me out just alongside the engine that was to pull'the 
train over the next division of the road; and, just at that 
instant, the engineer climbed down from his cab, to give 
his machine a final oiling for his run. I took a look at 
him (I always take a look —a good long look—at an 
engineer), and I recognized him as an old Irish engineer 
friend of mine whom I had known a good many years 
before, when he was running on an Eastern road... So 
T called out to him, “ Hello, Mike!” 
He flashed his torch in my face, and, in spite of the 
years that had passed since we had last met, recognized 
Me, and gave me a hearty greeting, for old times’ sake. 
We chatted a minute or two, and then he said, looking at 
his watch: “ But time is up now, an’ I must finish ‘ilin’ 
her. But put up your grip on the box, an’ ride wid me.” 
So I did as he told me to do, put my grip on the front

end of the seat on the fireman’s side of the cab, and rode 
with old Mike a hundred and fifty miles that night. 
And it was a ride never to be forgotten, It wasa 
wild, stormy night. The wind was blowing and howling 
out of the northwest, and the snow was piling in huge 
drifts before us as we went. It was a ponderous engine 
that old Mike drove. The six drivers under her were each 
a full seven feet in diameter, and four revolutions of her 
wheels sent her nearly a hundred feet along the track. 
It was the night express. There were eleven cars be- 
hind us, carrying hundreds of men, women, and children, 
and thousands on thousands of dollars’ worth of mer- 
chandise. In the Pullmans, scores of people were 
sleeping, just as safe as though they had been at home 
in their beds. As Mr. Taylor used to say, the train was 
“a world on wheels,” and a wonderful, mighty world it 
was, 
And old Mike sat on that box and whirled that train 
through space at the rate of fifty miles an hour, ina 
way that almost took my breath away. He knew every 
switch, every rail, almost every tie that he ran over 
Sometimes he would plunge into a snow drift that half 
filled the cut ahead of us, and it would seem for a minute 
as though an avalanche had buried us miles deep. 
And then, again, through a long stretch of open prairie, 
the wind would sweep across us as if it would blow us 
off the track. But through it all — the night, the storm, 
the darkness, the drifts, and the tempest-fury of the 
winds through it all, that old man sat with his handot 
the lever, and without a single false move, or the loss of 
so much as a-mill of the treasure committed to his care 
or a wink of sleep to a passenger aboard, he drove his 
train safely to its destination, and then, in a quiet, ur

     assuming way, entered his report of “on ;

Beloved, I take off my hat to that old: mana 
to the greatest soul on earth. Let us uncover 
kings and princes of the realm, on occasion. 
be well to do so. But in the presence of: 
as old Mike, let us not only stand bare 
silent. 
I watched him in the most tense moments of 
and there was a radiance shining through the. 
of his old face that almost made the dark 
about him. His eye gleamed and spoke a. 
things that tongue of man can never tell. His, and 
held the lever with a touch that was as delicate: and 
sensitive to what it was controlling as is the finger tip 
of the most skillful violinist to the vibrations of the 
string it presses down. I was in the presence of an 
artist in his line, of one of the truly great in life. 
Well, the next night this old. engineer came to hear 
me talk, and in my talk I gave the definition of an edu- 
cated man that I have given above, and he heard what 
I said. After it was all over, and the -audience bad-~ 
gone away, he waited for me at the door, and. after a 
complimentary word or two, he said: — 
“But I can bate you all out of the face in giving a 
definition of an iducated man.” 
And I said, “Let it come.” 
Whereupon he replied, ‘Why, don’t. you know that y 
any man is an iducated. man when he’s on to his job!” 
He was right! His definition is better than mine, and 
it lets a whole flood of white light in where there was. 
surely mist, not to say, in some cases, the blackness,of 
darkness before. Doubtless it is a crude way of saying   
 
-P-A-G-E-174
166 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
it, but there is a strength and directness in the remark 
that clears away the rubbish to a degree. 
Grant all that may be said about the “breadth of 
vision and loftiness of view” that is reckoned as a com 
' stant quantity in the generally accepted estimate as to 
what goes along with an education, and which are ust 
ally counted as being a never failing asset in the belong. 
ings of a supposed-to-be educated man. These things 
may all be real, and they are all right, when they are 
genuinely present, and when their possessors keep their 
feet on the ground, even if their heads do touch the stars. 
But when they are only vision and view, as is too often 
the case, they are a delusion and a snare. Unless the 
man who has breadth of vision and loftiness of view cat 
do things, unless he is “onto his job,” he is a poor excuse 
for a man, and a very worthless member of society, take 
him how you will. I would not be harsh, or unfair, but 
is not this the truth, when we come down to the bottom 
facts in the case? 
Indeed, I believe it is right and fair to hold Mike's 
method of proof asa sure test of the reality of any ont’ 
profession as to his being an educated man. Let him 
who makes such a claim be brought to this trial, as 1 
whether or not he is “onto his job,” whatever that job 
may be, and we shall all soon see how, like a refiners 
fire, such a test “ proves up.” We shall see it burn and 
purge away all pretense and vainglory, all the dross of 
glamour and show, and reveal only the pure gold of what 
the man really has and is. None who are truly ed 
cated will even think of shrinking from such a test 
their claims. None who are unfit but will be forced 
out, on being subjected to such trial. It is fair to alli 
it is unfair to none. Let’s try it on — ourselves!
-P-A-G-E-175
WHAT IS EDUCATION? = 
  Meantime, let us bring to proof a few who’ have here 
tofore been judged only by the old standards, aed noe 
how they endure the test. " 
Ministers are counted educated men, ‘anywhere and 
everywhere. I do not say they are not educated men, . 
but bring them to old Mike’s proof, and then 
    Did you ever see a clergyman who-was ot “onto 
his job”? Were you ever forced to: sit “ander the 
droppings of a sanctuary” whose overflow was bo 
stranger to the river of the water of life?.’ If so;:could: 
you honestly say, or even think, that such a minister . 
was an educated man ? 
Lawyers are counted as educated men. Did you 
ever know a lawyer who was not “ onto his job”? Tf 
the empty pocket books that have been made void by 
incompetent “counsel” could set up a wail, there would 
be a noise, 
Doctors are counted as educated men. Did: you ever 
see a doctor who was not “onto his job”?. If our 
graveyards could tell stories, they would startle multi 
tudes with their revelations. 
School teachers are counted as educated. Did you 
ever see a school teacher who was not “onte his job”? 
If the thousands of children who have been made the 
victims of incompetents in the schoolroom could tell 
the truth about what has been done to them, their 
Stories would make the very stones cry out. 
But I will not extend the list. The principle involved 
isall 1 care about. My point is, that old Mike's test is 
a true one, apply it where we will. Bring to it not only 
those I have named, but bring also any and all others, 
from any and all crafts, trades, or professions whatso- 
¢ver, and the result is the same. If they are “onto” 
    
-P-A-G-E-176
168 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
their jobs,” they are educated in their respective lines, 
If they fail in doing well the work they undertake to 
do, they are not educated, no matter what their repu- 
tations for education may be, or what their written or 
printed credentials may say about it. The test is final, 
and from it there can be no appeal. There is no higher 
court to bring the case before. 
It is the business of our public schools so to train all 
the children of all the people that they shall be onto 
their respective jobs, all of them, when they are grown 
to be men and women; for so, and so only, will these 
same men and women make first class citizens; so, only, 
will they fill to the full their respective places as worthy 
members of the commonwealth; so, only, will they 
demonstrate the proposition that the state is justified 
in taxing all the people to give all the children an 
education. 
- This, then, is what an education really is; namely, 4 
training for life that will fit the individual to do well the 
thing he undertakes, no matter what that thing may be. 
This is genuine righteousness. Its pursuit is the build 
ing of character, and it is all good for the soul. And 
this is only another way of saying that it is religion, 
pure and undefiled. 
Truly Walt Whitman says, “ How close our work is 
holding us to God, the Loving Laborer through time 
and space.” Only that is education which teaches us 
to work as God works, true to the line, every stroke.

We can never educate all the children of all the peo 
ple till we change our inherited thought as.to.what‘an 
education will do for a child. As things are now, there 
is one idea that is most prominent in the general mind 
on this score, and it is one of the ideas that it will be ex- 
ceedingly difficult to get rid of because it is so generally 
diffused among our people. It is the notion that ifa 
child gets a good memory-knowledge of books he wil 
thereby be relieved from the necessity of working wit! 
his hands, and that to work with one’s hands. is dis- 
graceful. po ee 
It is really wonderful how widespread and deep- 
seated this notion is. It pervades all classes of society, 
from the lowest to the highest. An old washerwoman 
said to me, the other day: “I’m workin’ hard to keep 
Mary Ann in school, so I am, so that, whin.she gets as 
old as her poor old mother is, she won’t have to work 
as hard as her poor old mother does.” That tells the 
whole story, from that viewpoint; and, put in varying

phrase, according to the different ranks of society, it 
embodies the popular idea all along the line. 
A little while ago I visited a high school in one of 
our middle-sized cities, and I stood by the side of one 
of the teachers, in the hail, as the pupils passed along 
to their classes. The great majority of these pupils 
were girls (it is so the country over), and a fine-looking 
company they were. (This also is common.) And! 
said to the teacher: “I wonder if one of those girls 
would be willing to marry a man who had a hard hand 
that had to get dirty in doing its work.” 
And the teacher turned to me with a look of amaze 
ment, tinctured with disgust, as she replied: “Why 
should any one of them ever be willing to do such a 
unworthy thing, a thing so thoroughly beneath her? ! 
trust they have all been educated above such things 
And there you are! . 
And yet, the great bulk of the men of this nation 
have got to get dirty hands in doing their work. The 
vast majority of our men folk have got to earn their 
~ living by labor that necessitates soiling of the hands, 
There is no such thing as putting this fact out of the 
way, and we might as well face it, one time as another. 
And these girls that I saw in that high school ar 
the natural mates for young men who have to dirly 
their hands with manual labor. They are from similar 
families, have similar parentage, live in similar homes 
eat at similar tables. They are the sisters of young mea 
who have to “work for a living.” They should be th 
sweethearts and wives of young men who have to work 
for a living — helpmeets for them, in the fullest sens¢ 
of that practical old word. But will such a training 4 
the girls I saw were having in that high school, ald
-P-A-G-E-179
WHAT EDUCATION MUST DO FOR A CHILD 171 
under that teacher (and the case is not exceptional), 
bring them to their own — their natural own, on this 
count? And if it does not do this, but does the very 
reverse of this, what about it ? 
Now the fact is, there ought not to be such an over- 
whelming majority of girls in our high schools as we 
now find there. And there would not be—there will 
not be, when we fashion these schools along new lines, 
on the basic idea of the real place of work in the world. 
As it is now, the great bulk of our boys drop out of 
our schools at the end of the grammar grade, and there 
they and their sisters part company. 
And this is bad. They and their sisters need to be 
kept together, for more reasons than I can stop to tell 
about here. But won't you take time honestly to think © 
out a few of these reasons, and ask yourself what can 
best be done about these things, in view of their far- 
teaching importance — think what can be ‘done about 
them in your school, or with your children? 
If you stop to think about it thus, you will see that the 
Cause for our popular thought regarding the lack of dig- 
nity of manual labor reaches back into the far-away past, 
and that it is grounded in the monarchical idea of social 
life and of political institutions. As generally thought 
of, it is counted to be the mission of manual labor to serve. 
It is almost never considered as worthy for its own sake. 
Imagine one saying “manual labor for manual labor's 
sake”! We have been taught to say “art for art’s 
sake,” time out of mind. We have also been taught 
that “that’s different.” Is it? I know that it is gener- 
ally thought to be so, but is it? 
The fundamental principle that underlies a throne is 
that it, and all that it stands for, must be served; and that
-P-A-G-E-180
172, ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
he who serves is—- must be — held in subjection, and 
therefore humiliated by such service. Men and women 
who have breathed free air do not like to be in subjection 
and humiliated. And because manual labor has for so 
long had the badge of meniality fastened about its neck, 
for this reason men and women who wish to count them 
selves as “free and equal ” are anxious to put themselves 
and their children as far as possible from the supposedly 
accursed thing. Right here is the core of the great 
desire of the multitudes to free themselves from what 
they have been taught, for ages, is the degradation of 
labor. 
There is another thing that leads to the same result, 
and that gives a special trend to what the multitudes 
desire to do in these days, in lieu of working with theit 
hands, shows up very plainly when we look at the history 
of what has so long been called education, and of those 
who have been counted as making up the educated 
classes, A moment’s thought will reveal the fact that 
none of these educated people worked with their hands; 
and the result of going to educational institutions, as they 
have existed, time out of mind, has always been some 
thing other than manual labor. Clergymen, lawyet 
doctors, teachers, and always the sons of gentlemen who 
had money enough to live without working — these, and 
their likes, have been the “output” of the schools for 
centuries. I have said that before, but it needs sayilé 
more than once. 
And so, because these two things have existed 
gether, because those who have been to the schools 
not work with their hands, the notion grew up that, 
somehow, the one was the cause of the other, and that 
to have an education exempted one from the necesstt
-P-A-G-E-181
WHAT EDUCATION MUST DO FOR A CHILD 173 
of manual labor. And because manual labor is counted 
assomething to be shunned on account of the bad name 
attached to it, and since men and women have learned 
to think that an education will free them from its sup- 
posed thraldom, for these reasons multitudes of those 
who have labored with their hands in the past are es- 
pecially anxious to have their children acquire an educa- 
tion so that they will be relieved from the necessity of 
work. 
How often have I heard some good old farmer and 
his wife say: “We don’t want to have. our children 
work as hard as we have worked. We had better move 
to town and give them an education, so that they won't 
have to work when they are grown up.” And how 
often have I scen these same people move to town, 
Prompted by such a motive, bringing with them a 
healthy and hearty lot of boys and girls of whom they 
might well be proud, but of whom they are practically 
More than half ashamed. And how often have I seen 
these same children fit only to be ashamed of in a few 
years, the boys cigarette fiends, carrying canes and 
walking like dudes, and the girls devoted to dress and 
Society only ! 
I have not one word to say against farmers moving - 
to town to educate their children, or against their truly 
educating them in any way they can; but one thing that 
Ido protest against is the purpose that underlies their 
trying to educate them, in so many cases, and as so 
often seen. They are the victims, parents and children 
alike, of the fallacious idea that labor is a curse, and ¥ 
that a book education will free one from its taint. They 
are far more to be pitied than blamed; but, more than 
all, they need to be helped out of their unfortunate con-
-P-A-G-E-182

dition, they need to have their eyes opened to the truth 
in the premises. 
What our public schools must do is to enter upon 
such courses of instruction and training as will dignify 
and deify labor. Their work must be such as con- 
stantly to impress upon the children who attend them 
the fact that no one calling, in and of itself, is more , 
sacred than another, no one more honorable or more de 4 
grading than another. They must teach that the plow- 
share is fully as worthy a piece of steel as the sword, 
and that it is at least as honorable to serve humanity in 
acorn field as on a battle field. They must instill into 
the minds of the children the great truth that any and 
all work well done is honorable, ever and always, and 
that a botch is an abomination in the sight of God, 00 
matter where, or surrounded with what supposed badges 
of honor and respectability the shoddy-weaving be done. 
Doubtless it is a part of the work of our public schodls 
to fit some of our boys and girls for professional work 
that will not require manual labor at their hands; but 
since the great bulk of our young people must labor 
with their hands when they are grown, it is the duty of 
our schools to fit them also for their particular wotk 
in life, work which they cannot avoid, and which itis 
wicked to teach them they ought to wish or try 
avoid. 
We shall never succeed in educating all of the chil 
dren of all of the people, till we first succeed in establish- 
ing in the minds of our people the great, basic truth tit 
labor is not a curse but a blessing, and that it is not the 
purpose of an education to free a child from the neces 
sity of labor— manual labor included —when he i 
grown; but that its end and aim is to fit him so

can do, to perfection, the work in this world that he un- 
dertakes, or is set to perform. When the people fully 
comprehend and accept this idea of the-mission of edu- 
cation in social life, then our schools will be fashioned 
accordingly; and then, and not till then, will they ac- 
complish what their founders, and those who have fos- 
them, have always hoped they would one day 
ccomplish,

AnD now, having cleared away a lot of the rubbish 
which the years have piled in the path of what seemsta 
me to be true education and right educational theories 
and methods, as a prelude to the positive constructive 
work that lies before me I am going to sandwich is, 
just here, a sort of analogical essay under the title of 
Sympathetic Vibration, which I believe will be worth 
the reader all the space it takes up in these pages and 
the time it takes to read it. 
I thought, at first, to just use the term “sympatheti¢ 
vibration” and let it go at that. But on talking with 
teachers and some of my friends about what was meaat 
by these words, I found that not one in scores of them 
knew anything about it~ an experience which convinced 
me that I must explain the principle in detail if I used 
it at all. (To say this may not be complimentary to BY 
friends and the teachers I talked with, nor to the readet 
176
-P-A-G-E-185
SYMPATHETIC VIBRATION 174 
but it was true of those I spoke with, anyhow. If you, 
dear reader, know all about it now, skip this chapter. 
If not, read it all, carefully.) 
Wireless telegraphy has done more than any other 
thing in recent times to set one thinking about still 
more wonderful phenomena that may lie in the same 
eneral direction — may be based on the same principle 
this marvelous invention, namely, those of sympathetic 
vibration. 
This principle is nothing new in the scientific world, 
but Marconi’s application of it, in heretofore unknown 
regions, bids fair to revolutionize the civilization of the 
age. The fable of stealing fire from heaven, and of what . 
that act did for mankind, is as a trifle compared with what 
this talking through the air is destined to do for human- 
ity. Already it has changed all the possibilities of war, 
both on land and on sea; and when the fighting ability 
of a world is remodeled, the whole social fabric is 
affected to a tremendous degree. And that is only one 
of the marvels of this latest of modern discoveries. 
Briefly stated, the principle is this: If a certain vibra~ 
tion is set going in a given plane, its waves go out in all 
directions from the originating point, and pervade all the 
space covered by a circle of greater or less extent. Now 
if, a vibration having been set up, there be within the 
affected space any other body or bodies that would 
naturally give forth just the same number and kind of 
vibrations as are given out by the one already in motion, 
then those others will take up the vibration, on their own 
account, and begin to vibrate in harmony with whatever 
is giving out the original waves. That is, they will 
vibrate in sympathy with something that is already 
vibrating, rather than because they are directly set in 
N
-P-A-G-E-186
178 ALL THE CHILDREN.OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
motion themselves. This is what is called sympathetic 
vibration. 
Take a simple illustration, which you can easily verify 
if you care to do so: Suppose you take two common 
tuning forks which, being struck, both give forth the 
tone of A of the musical scale. Bore a hole in each of 
two wooden blocks, and set the forks up on their handles 
in these holes, one in each block. Set one of th 
blocks, with its fork inserted, on a table at one end of @ 
room, and put the other block and fork somewhere at 
the other end of the room. Now if you will strike one 
of. these block-supported forks vigorously; or, better 
still, draw a fiddle bow across it with considerable force 
and so set it to humming, so that it will give forth a 
good full tone, and will keep this up for a few seconds, 
the fork at the other end of the room will begin to 
vibrate without your touching it at all, and youcan thus 
cause it to give out so strong a tone that it can be heard 
all over the room. Indeed, when you get it once well 
humming, from sympathy with the original, you can put 
' your hand on the first fork, the one you made to vibrate 
directly, thereby stopping its vibrations, and the fork that 
was made to hum sympathetically will keep on vibrating 
for some seconds afterwards. This is a very simple and 
beautiful experiment, and well repays the making. 
This principle of sympathetic vibration is the basis of 
Mr. Marconi’s wireless telegraphy, only he uses mag- 
netic vibrations instead of sound vibrations to secure bis 
results. . 
Now suppose, instead of having two A tuning forks 
you have two se¢s of similar forks, covering all the tone 
from’A to.G in the musical scale. Suppose these to he 
mounted on blocks, as before, and one set put at oné  
-P-A-G-E-187
SYMPATHETIC VIBRATION 179 
end of a room, and the other set at the other end of the 
room, as in the other case. 
Now if you strike the A of one set, the A in the other 
set will vibrate sympathetically ; but that is all the re- 
sponse you will get from the whole row of forks. The 
B,C, D, E, F, and G will be as silent as though there 
were no such thing as vibration in all the world. The 
same thing will occur if you strike any other one fork, 
as B, or C, or E, etc. The corresponding fork will vi- 
brate, and ail the rest will be dumb. Or, if you strike 
all seven of one set, at one and the same time, all the 
other seven will vibrate in response, each fork picking 
out its own particular vibrations from what seems to be 
a jangle of sounds. None of them will get mixed up, 
hone will fail to respond. : 
Now, suppose you had a row of seven forks, ranging 
from A to G, on one side of the room, and on the other 
side a row of forks that had never been tested, but 
Which were theoretically supposed to be the same as 
those you knew about; and suppose, further, that it was 
your business to set up vibration in the forks that you 
eally did not know about, but which were supposed to 
beso and so, by causing them to vibrate sympathetically 
with your own bank of forks. And suppose, too, that you 
had been taught that the only correct way to set up sym- 
Pathetic vibrations in an unknown row of forks was to 
begin with your own A fork, and to secure a response 
from a corresponding fork of that particular key, from 
across the room, before you proceeded any further, or 
tried any other forks in the row! So you strike your 
A, and look for a sympathetic vibration from across the 
toom. And suppose there be no response, nothing but 
silence like the grave !
-P-A-G-E-188
180 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
And then suppose you say: “I must get a response 
from this A, and I wii!” So you pound away on 
your A, and keep pounding, and still nothing comes of 
it from the other side of the house. You pound and 
listen, and then pound and listen again, but it all goes 
for nothing. 
Then suppose you fall back on the authorities that 
you may have spent years in becoming acquainted with, 
and which say: “In order to awaken a sympathetic 
vibration in a bank of forks across the room, first strike 
your own A, and get a sympathetic response from that 
before proceeding further, etc.” Moreover, suppose 
the System you are serving under says to you: “You 
must get a response from A before you do anything 
else. In order that the forks across the room may be 
regularly graded, it is necessary that the A be developed in the tow, and that particular tone be first forthcoming 
The System demands this, and you must bring about 
_ such a result if you expect to stay where you are.” 
Then what? 
Then, in the language of the wicked world, “ you are 
up against it,” and it is no wonder that you grow des 
perate. So you pound away on your A till you af 
nearly wild; and when no response comes you do oné 
of two things: either you manage somehow to fabri 
cate some kind of a noise on the other side of the room 
that, for the time being (examination day), will sound 
something like an A vibration; or else you say, “ The 
forks on the other side of the room are worthless, and! 
will throw them all out and be rid of them, for they até 
not worth bothering with!” And so you “drop” of 
“expel” the whole outfit! 
Is my analogy too severe? I think not. The fact
-P-A-G-E-189
SYMPATHETIC VIBRATION 181 
is, there is nothing the matter with your A, nor with 
the row of forks across the room. The only trouble 
lies in the fact that you are trying to do the impossible, 
to arouse a sympathetic vibration where there is noth- 
ing in sympathy to vibrate. The only difficulty with 
the row of forks across the room is that they have no A 
in their row! But they may have a first-class B and C 
and D and E and F and G. And if you would only 
strike, or be permitted to strike, one or all of these in 
your own bank, there would be no trouble about getting 
a response from their correspondents across the room. 
Or, having tried to get a response from A, and having 
failed, would it not be good common sense to try some 
other fork before condemning the whole row opposite, 
or before throwing them all out to rust in the gutter? 
Or, knowing that there are forks in the other bank 
that can and do vibrate “just naturally,” would it not 
be a shame to muffle these and declare that they should 
never give forth a single wave of sound till an A-tone 
of more or less volume could be developed? 
How simple all these questions seem when they re- 
late to tuning forks! I believe they are just as simple, 
and as apropos, when they relate to boys and girls. 
These “born short” pupils, of the thousand-and-one 
varieties, fail to respond to our efforts to arouse them 
sympathetically because there is nothing in them that 
will, at that time, vibrate in harmony with the particular 
vibrations that we set up. If you doubt this, watch any 
such pupil, and you cannot fail to be convinced of the 
truth of my proposition. In such cases, the child’s eye 
gives forth no answering light, his face is as blank as a 
bare wall, and his whole being expresses only inanity. 
But touch this same child on a key that he can vibrate
-P-A-G-E-190
182 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
in harmony with, and you have a live being on the in 
stant. We all know how it is. 
“ But,” some one says, “should not every well-bal 
anced set of tuning forks have an A? Is it right to 
permit such a bank to continue to exist in a partially 
completed condition? Should we not make it our chief 
endeavor to remedy the deficiency, and so make perfect 
harmony possible?” Or, applied to boys and girls, the 
question is asked: “Are we not in danger of making 
one-sided people if we -permit them to grow where they 
are naturally strong, and do not compel them to keep 
an even pace with all the faculties of the human mind?” 
To which I make reply: In the case of the tuning 
forks, it is doubtless possible to buy the missing links 
in the open market, and duly install them in their 
Proper places; but when it comes to boys and girls, the 
thing cannot be done in that way. There is no shop ™ 
all the world that manufactures human capabilities and 
keeps them on sale! . 
And, more than that, I do not believe there is @ 
thousandth part of the danger that is so generally talked, 
of developing one-sided people by permitting them move out strongly along the lines of their native ab 
ties. On the contrary, I am thoroughly convinced 
the most promising way to get an individual to gr" 
strong where he is naturally weak is to give him 4 
chance to use his strength where he has the ability 
do.so. 
If a given bank of forks seems to be minus a0 A, 
you can never develop one in that bank by merelf 
sounding your own A. But strike all the rest of ie 
row, and get a good strong vibration from the othe 
forks. in response, and something may come of
-P-A-G-E-191
SYMPATHETIC VIBRATION 183 
Perhaps the A in the other bank is cobwebbed, or 
muffled in some way, and if you can give the rest of 
the row a good vigorous shaking up, so that its very 
foundation trembles in response, you may, perchance, 
jar the A loose, and get a hum from it when you were 
least expecting it. I have seen such an outcome more 
than once. But I never saw much of any good come 
from trying to force a sympathetic vibration. That is 
not nature’s way — God’s way! 
As a case in point, I once knew a boy who was an 
“incorrigible” in school for years. He had been sus- 
pended and expelled, time and again. When he was 
about sixteen, the superintendent met him on the street 
one day, and said to him: “George, is there anything 
in school that you would really like to study?” And 
the boy replied: “Yes, I've always wanted to study 
chemistry, but I shall never know enough to doit.” And 
the superintendent said: “If you will come to school 
tomorrow, I’ll put you into a chemistry class, and you 
needn't study anything else.” The boy agreed, and 
the experiment was tried. 
Before the first term was over, this boy slept in the 
school laboratory every night for a whole week, in order 
to keep continuous watch of some delicate experiments 
he was making. He stuck to the work till he had done 
all the chemistry that could be done in the local school ; 
and then, though he was woefully deficient in nearly all 
the other high school studies, the superintendent suc- 
ceeded in getting him admitted to the chemistry course 
in one of the best colleges in the country, where he 
led his class in his favorite study. 
I saw a letter written to the superintendent by this 
boy when he was in college. There was scarcely a
-P-A-G-E-192
184 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
misspelled word in it, and the composition was good 
Yet he had been a proverbially poor speller in school, 
and he was once expelled because he simply would not 
do written language work. It is fair to say that there 
were shortcomings in the letter, but these were chiefly 
grammatical errors, which were the result of environ 
ment in the boy’s early life, such as the use of “done” 
for “did,” and “saw” for “seen,” etc. These things 
are bad, I grant; but is it not far better to have a live, 
decent boy, such as this young fellow became, with 
grammatical errors included, than to have a worthless 
loafer, such as he would most surely have become had 
he not been set on his feet as he was? . That is the 
point, and there can be but one answer. 
The last I knew of the young man, he was holding a 
responsible position as chemist in a large commercial 
establishment. And if you should happen to meet him 
at dinner, or in a parlor, or in any ways of common 
social life, you would never think about his being ont 
sided. 
_Oh, perhaps if you are “long” on ancient history 
and should try to draw him out on the details of yout 
favorite subject, he might not vibrate fast or hard just 
there, But he could easily turn the tables on you by 
“a turn about” which would be only “fair play.” You 
might detect a shortage in. his grammar, and be sorry 
for his misfortune, but you would be a prig if you failed 
to'see in him a very bright man, or if you turned him 
down because of his weak place. 
And this should be remembered, too, when we talk 
about one-sided people. We are very apt to set a maa 
down as belonging in this class if he fails to respond t? 
our own particular hum. More than that, we are wont
-P-A-G-E-193
SYMPATHETIC VIBRATION ; 185 
to count some hums as very much superior to other 
hums; and we are quite apt to be cock-sure that our 
own particular hum is the finest in all the world. But 
the fact is, there is not nearly the difference in hum 
values that there is commonly supposed to be; and, 
always, a genuine vibration of almost any sort is to be 
preferred to one that is merely a motion gone through 
with because it is the proper thing, or one that has been 
manufactured by somebody else, and somehow fastened 
to the party who merely shakes according to rule. 
A truly sympathetic vibration is a joy to all who feel 
its animating thrill. Its counterfeit is not only a bore to 
all parties concerned, but it is a dismal, soul-destroying 
lie, An education that is gained by the sympathetic 
response of the student to what he is taught is a live 
thing that will endure, and always be full of value and 
delight. Knowledge that is acquired by learning things 
only because they are in “the course” is a dead thing 
that will be buried out of sight, and utterly forgotten in 
a few years, at most. In the brief space that it shows 
semblance of life it will prove itself valueless and a de- 
lusion ; and, buried, it will never be missed. 
A machine-shaken crowbar is not a sensitive Marconi 
point. Nevertheless, it may be a first-class crowbar. 
The only trouble comes in trying to play. it off for what 
it is not, and never can be. A good crowbar is as valu- 
able in its place as a Marconi point is in its place.. But 
it is not well to try to make either take the place of the 
other. The analogy holds good in the schoolrooms of 
our public schools, and in the attempted education of 
all the children of all the people, everywhere and always,

EDUCATIONAL VALUES 
The Regular and Conventional Views on this Subject —“The 
Humanities ”— Ability to read Latin and Greek a Transient 
Acquirement for most of the Classically Educated — They do not 
“hum” to these Studies — Ex-President Eliot’s Testimony— 
Educational Value of Manual Training —The Real Measure of 
any Educational Value—Latin Races, Mathematics and Lae 
guage—The Negro and Logical Ability— Disregard of such 
Facts depletes the Ranks of the Ought-To-Be-Educated — Re 
forms that must follow. 
Tue methods of education that I have advocated in 
these pages naturally suggest the subject of educational 
values, which must be fairly considered from this new 
pedagogic viewpoint, in any comprehensive treatment 
of the issue in hand. 
Since time out of mind, educational theorists have 
had much to say regarding the relative educational value 
of studies of various sorts, and their corresponding worth 
as a means for developing a human mind ; and, for ree 
sons that I cannot go into here, the great balance of 
opinion has been, for many years, in favor of the class 
cal studies of Greek, Latin, and history (especially 
ancient history) as being the most potent in this 
spect. In addition to these, mathematics has sometimés 
been included. The classics have been called “the 
humanities,” and it has been given out, over and ove 
again, ever since Plato’s time, that the pursuit of thes 
particular studies would produce a wonderfully mollify 
186
-P-A-G-E-195
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 187 
ing, gentlemanizing effect upon all those who pursued 
them. 
There is no question but that this claim is true, in 
some cases, perhaps in a great many, where people 
vibrate that way ; but it is very far from being true for 
mankind in general—for all the children of all the 
people. 
The simple fact is, there is no one study, or set of 
studies, that will produce uniformly good results in all 
cases, for all children. It is a matter of individuality, 
of personality, here as elsewhere in all the ways of life. 
One study has educational value for one child, another 
for another. But, always, those studies which will set a 
given child a-humming are the ones, and the only ones 
worth mentioning, that have educational value for that 
child. If Greek and Latin will do this for any child, or 
for any number of children, all right. And there is a 
considerable number of such children, I am sure; but 
that the number is as great as the devotees of the “hu 
manities” idea have led us to think—of this I am 
greatly in doubt. 
How many men or women do you know who can read 
cither Greek or Latin to amount to anything? How 
many pupils have you ever had who really vibrated in 
Tesponse to the classics? Some, surely, but not very 
Many. 
A college president told me, only a few days ago, 
that he did not think five men in one hundred who had 
studied the classics in college could read either Greek 
or Latin, to amount to much, five years after graduation 
day, The statement is his, not mine, and he is a clas- 
Sically educated man, one who believes in that sort of 
thing, I could but wonder, though, how truly the

ninety-five, who forgot within five years the languages 
they had spent so much time upon, how truly they evet 
hummed to these languages, and of how much educa 
tional value these studies really were to those who pu 
sued them, _ 
On the other hand, a friend of mine who studied 
French for only one year, and that under a very poor 
teacher, thirty-five years ago, now reads that language 
almost as well as she reads English. But she hums to 
that language. Her geometry, though, that she spent 
weary months upon, is a dead thing to her now, and has 
been so for years, The question is, was it ever alive 
or is any study ever alive that one does not naturally 
vibrate in harmony with while pursuing it, and retain, 
readily, ever afterwards? What do you think? 
_ In the presence of facts like these, to make a course 
of study that insists that a pupil must vibrate to thes 
classical studies, or to any other particular studies, if he 
stays in school at all, is just as bad as possibly can be 
On this point, so excellent an authority as ex-President 
Eliot, of Harvard, has recently said that “whatever 
study is well and thoroughly taught in public high 
schools, taught in a way to inspire interest and give 
_ trained mental power, is of genuine educational value.” 
Which is only another way of saying that any stuly 
that the pupil vibrates in harmony with, is, for that 
child, a valuable means for his genuine education

in this country in harmony with ex-President Eliot 00

For the sake of emphasizing a point that needs bea 
ing down on just here, I call the reader’s attention 10

the fact that the above-quoted opinion from President 
Eliot is broad enough to include the discipline and cul- 
ture that comes from business and manual training, from 
actual, practical work with head and hands. Here is a 
source of educational value that has never been very 
highly thought of, that has never counted for very much, 
especially in the eyes of those who have been reckoned 
as educated men and women. . Yet, that it has a meas- 
ureless value of this sort for multitudes of children, 
is every day becoming more and more apparent. Ina 
way that I shall speak of later in greater detail, manual 
training initiates and develops capacity for the reception 
of genuine knowledge that is a great factor in true 
educational growth, 
Besides this, there are thousands, yes, millions of chil- 
dren in this country that will vibrate in this plane of 
manual work (or, at least, the beginnings of their vibra- 
tion can be assured here), who can never respond to the 
stimulative energies included in a regular graded school 
Course, to amount to very much. But, once genuinely 
vibrating in a plane to which they naturally respond, the 
Possibility of getting them to respond in still other planes 
is greatly increased. The point is that, as things now 
are, these millions of children who fail to respond as the 
System declares they must, if they stay in the schools — 
these children are dropped out of the schools altogether, 
thereby losing that culture, training, and guidance for 
mature life which their years demand, and which the 
school ought to give to every child in this nation. Man- 
ual training would keep multitudes of these children in 
the schools a great deal longer than they now stay there, 
all of which would be just so much to their advantage. 
So, then, the basic need in determining for each child
-P-A-G-E-198
190 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
what studies are of educational value to him or to heris 
to find out those that will secure a genuine response from 
“that particular child. This does not mean that a child 
is never to be asked or required to set himself vigorously 
to. work to accomplish a task that may not be altogether 
pleasant, at the outset, — not that at all. Neither doesit 
mean that if a pupil does not take immediate delight in 
a given study, that this is proof positive that he is “bom 
short” on that side, and so should never be asked to 
pursue that study further. We all know, though, well 
enough, just what it does mean. We know that it is 
practically useless, and often wicked, to hold a pupil 
that we have proved, over and over again, has no apti- 
tude whatever for a given study — who does not vibrate 
to its stimulating energy in the least — that it is a sit fo 
keep such a student at such work, regardless of the way 
heis. That is the whole story. Such work will rarely 
if ever do him any good at all. The chances are many 
to one that it will do him positive harm. I have seet 
such results in multitudes of cases, and so have you 
if you have honestly watched the phenomena. 
The right thing to do is, if we find a pupil in our pub 
lic schools who actually fails to vibrate to a given stimu- 
lus, after ‘having honestly tried to do so, but who will 
vibrate in some other plane —the thing to do is to per” 
mit such pupil to vibrate where he can, and so keep him 
in the schools. He should never be cast out because he 
is unable to vibrate according to the course, or just as 
his class vibrates. : 
Now, the fact is, there are not only individual chi- 
dren, but there are whole races of children who lack the 
ability to vibrate in certain planes, but who can and will 
vibrate, strongly and well, in other planes. Thus, the
-P-A-G-E-199
EDUCATIONAL VALUES mgr 
children of the Latin races are, for the most part, 
“short” on the mathematical side and “long” on the 
language and artistic sides of their make-up. Any 
teacher who has had experience with children of these 
nationalities will verify this statement. 
I was walking on the streets of a Pennsylvania town 
with the superintendent of schools one day; and, as it 
was a few minutes after four, the school children were 
just on their way home. I noticed a large contingent 
of Italian children in the groups that we met (it was in 
the mining region), and I asked the superintendent how 
these children got along in his schools. And he said : — 
“Oh, they’re no good. They go a little while, and 
then they all drop out. You will notice that you hardly 
saw an Italian child over twelve years of age in all that 
th have met. We can’t hold them, to amount to any- 
ing.” 
And I said: “Why not? What’s the reason that 
they don’t stay with you? ‘Do they drop out of their 
own accord, or do you drop them out?” 
To which he replied: “Oh, they can’t do the work. 
They haven't any head for what we want, not one in a 
hundred of them.” 
“What haven’t they got a head for?” I asked. 
“They all fail in arithmetic!” he replied. “We 
simply can’t get them to do enough number work to 
keep them in their grades. They almost always fail in 
their arithmetic examinations, and so can’t go on with 
their regular grade work; so they stay in the same 
grade till they get tired of it, and we get tired of them, 
and then they drop out.” 
It was an honest answer. But— : 
“How are they in their language work?” I asked.
-P-A-G-E-200
192 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
“ Wonderful!” he replied. 
And then he went on to tell about a couple of boys, 
whose parents had recently come to this country with 
them, and who had placed them in school but a few 
weeks before. The boys knew not a word of English 
when they entered the school; and yet, he said, in an 
incredibly short time they had learned to read, and also 
to write beautifully. 
“It is really wonderful,” he added, “ how quickly the 
little. rascals will pick up our language, not only these 
two, but the whole lot of them. But in mathematics 
they are good for nothing. These two boys I have 
spoken of will go for a while, but arithmetic will knock 
them out before long, as it does all the rest of them 
They are almost all of them happy just so long as they 
can read a book or make pictures, or do anything in the 
line of drawing; but we simply can’t get them interested 
in arithmetic enough to hold them in school.” 
Now this seems to me a great pity, that these children 
should be put beyond the sphere of influence of publi schools just because they are naturally non-mathematical 
For, good sooth, what is mathematics that it should be 
made the szze gua non of good citizenship? And good 
citizens is what we want to make out of these same 
Italian children —good American citizens. That s 
what the public schools are for, above everything else,~ 
to make good citizens, whether they are good mathe 
maticians or not. And one can be a good citizen, evel 
if he be a poor mathematician ! 
But if we fail to take care of these same children; # 
we drop them out of the schools before we have dont 
much of anything for them, simply because they at 
unable to pursue successfully a study which the colleges
-P-A-G-E-201
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 393 
demand for admission to their doors — if we do this, how 
can we much longer ask all the people to pay for the 
support of these same schools? . That is a question that 
must keep us watchful, and that will bé asked in dead 
eamest, too, in the not very distant future. . 
And there are many other similar situations, all 
through our schools. Negro children, are, as a rule, 
deficient in mathematical and logical ability. Boys, 
take them as they run, are short on the side of technical 
grammar and rhetoric. What thousands of them have 
fallen by the way for this cause! You know them, 
don’t you? They should not have been forced out, or 
lost out, of our schools for so slight a cause, When it 
bad been proved that they could not attain to the college- 
made requirements of the school course, then a just and 
4 common-sense-made course, one that would meet their 
heeds and abilities, should have been made; one that 
they could attain to, and so could have stayed in school. 
That is what the schools are for, to keep children under 
their training influences, and not to turn them out be- 
Cause they fail to come up to a standard that an outsider 
has fixed one that really has no more right to direct 
the school affairs of this nation than any other private 
institution has. There should be no such thing as graft 
in our schools, and the colleges of this country should 
Teceive no more favors from them than do the black- 
smith shops or the farms. 
The records of high schools show that a very large 
Proportion, sometimes as high as fifty per cent of the 
pupils who enter them, drop out at the end of the first 
year. And a further study will reveal the fact that 
at least eight out of ten of the pupils that have thus 
dropped out have “failed to pass” in Latin or algebra, 
°

or both, as I have before stated. These are notorious 
facts, which are known to every high school teacher, 
It is getting to be time for the people to realize then, 
and to have something done for them, too. 
And let me say again that, in calling attention to these 
facts, Iam not “attacking the colleges,” nor am I saying 
one word against their work, as such. I am only mak 
ing the point that our colleges and universities are only 
some among many educational forces in this broad land 
of ours, and that the particular studies which they insist 
upon as being of educational value are only a few among 
many means for developing the human mind, for form- 
ing sterling individual character, for making first-class 
American citizens. 
These institutions all have their distinctive educational 
work to do, and for the most part, they are doing it well 
better now than ever before ; and they will continue to 
do it better yet, as the years go by. But they are not 
all there is in the educational world, and they must not 
be permitted to dictate to our public schools, nor in any 
way to hold them in such subjection that these schools 
shall fail, in large measure, to meet the requirements 
of practically all the children whose needs they were 
brought into being to satisfy. They must be permitted 
to have their share of the work done in these schools 
But they must not ask for all, or for an unfair percent 
age of influence or advantage, in the work done in public 
schools at public expense. 
Neither must they claim that the special studies they 
insist on are alone of educational value, and that all 
others are of secondary, or slight importance. Grad 
ally these institutions are coming to recognize, in theif 
own curricula, the fact that.any study is of educational
-P-A-G-E-203
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 195 
value that the student genuinely loves, that he vibrates 
in harmony with, that he pursues with zeal and with 
personal interest; and that any study which is under- 
taken, or labored with, in any other way than this, is 
not truly educative, but a bore and cheat. Seeing 
this, our leading colleges are now nearly all conducted 
upon a system which grants all the points I am con- 
tending for. All else that can be asked is, that this 
method, which has been found of such advantage. to 
the colleges and universities, should be passed on down 
the line, and so be made available for our public schools, 
from top to bottom. With this point gained, we can 
then, in each and every case, give to each and every 
child the privilege of pursuing such studies as experi- 
‘nce proves are of educational value for that particular 
Pupil. And that is all that any one can ask.

SHALL, then, our public schools have no courses of 
study? Iam asked. And I hasten to reply: No fixed 
-{,.and uniform courses, the same for all the children of all 
the people; no course which is “that or nothing” for 
every child—nothing like that, Surely not. We shall 
simply carry out, in all departments of these schools 
the principle of “electives,” now so thoroughly estab 
lished in the leading colleges and universities of this 
country. 
Then, instead of sticking to the idea that the childret 
are made for the schools, we shall stand on the just and 
rational basis that the schools are made for the childrea. 
Then, in determining what studies each several child 
196
-P-A-G-E-205
CONCERNING COURSES OF STUDY 197 
shall pursue, in making up a course of study for each, 
we shall be guided by the natural aptitude and abilities 
of that child, by the way he is, and not by the demands 
of any institution, or set of institutions, or of men— 
parties who have never seen the child in question, and 
so know nothing of what he really needs to make the 
most of himself. 
Then the first question in considering the educational 
work for any particular child will always be: How can 
we make a good citizen out of this child, an individual 
vho will be a help to the state and society, and not a 
burden upon both; how can we bring each child to the 
best there is in himself, and make the most of him, his 
natural abilities and possibilities being what they are? 
Then, we shall not be anxious to graduate a child in 
any set way, or to have him tally as any and all others: 
have done. We shall not care whether he is fitted for 
college or not. We shall only be anxious that he is 
fitted for the life he is to live. 
Then, we shall not be satisfied if we succeed in getting 
afew children in a hundred to stay in school until grad- 
vation day, but our ambition will be so to fashion the 
Work of these schools that substantially all the children 
who enter them shall graduate from them, death being 
the only cause for failure to come through. 
A little while ago a professor in a leading university 
in this country declared that “the end to be attained by 
tducating children is to produce human beings who are 
willing to undertake the passionless pursuit of passion- 
less intelligence.” I do not object to such human 
beings. If that is the way they are, all right. Let our 
public schools do all in their power to help even such 
individuals to the attainments of their passionless pur-
-P-A-G-E-206
198 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
pose. But do not permit these, and the likes of these, 
to make out courses of study for all the children of all 
the people. Because these latter are not passionless, 
On the contrary, the great bulk of all the children love 
things, and they love them hard. That is the way they 
are—the way God made them. And in making out 
courses of study for all these children, the school to 
come will take these things into account. 
As I have said before, this does not mean that each 
child shall be left to go his own gait, regardless; butit 
does mean that the school superintendent, the principal, 
the child’s teacher, the child’s parents, and the child 
himself —that all these together can find out, and do, 
what is best for the child, can make a course of study 
suited to his needs, from entering day to graduating 
day. They cannot do all this at a single sitting, and 
all on the day the child enters school for the first time: 
but through the years, as the work goes on, by 
working together, they can attain to a successful result 
in the great majority of cases. 
“ But,” some one says, “what about standards of 
scholarship? How can we ever tell of the attainments 
of any individual? If we cannot know that he ba 
pursued a certain formulated course of study in his 
educational work, how can we ever tell of the rank be 
ought to hold in the educational world? Are degre 
and titles to count for nothing?” and so forth, and soo 
To which I reply: The matter of educational 
which is determined by titles and diplomas is {# 
sinking into “innocuous desuetude”; that is, in # 
great world of the common people. Among ¢ 
classes, these things still are reckoned as of great worth: 
but not so among the masses. For the most parh
-P-A-G-E-207
CONCERNING COURSES OF STUDY 199 
one question now asked of any claimant for honors in 
any department of life or place is, “ What can you do?” 
not, “ What credentials have you on file?” Of course, 
credentials are of vadue, if they can be backed up by 
deeds that tally with what they stand for; but in the 
great world of to-day, the man who “holds down his 
job,” as the people say, does so by deeds, and not by 
diplomas. 
This was not always so. In the institutions that our 
schools have grown out of, it used to be very different, 
and it is now in some cases. In such times and places, 
ifa man duly graduated and secured his credentials, he 
Was awarded “a living”; and this he was sure of, so 
long as life lasted. Now, in the great world at large, it 
‘8a minor matter what credentials a man presents, so 
far as permanency of place is concerned. Such evi- 
dence will, in a measure, help to secure a place, but, ! 
once in, the incumbent must be able to “deliver the | 
S00ds,” or his tenure is brief —very brief. Besides this, it does not now mean what it once meant

Since it has changed its policy, the institution lun
-P-A-G-E-208
200 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
is full to overflowing. It will be so with all the depart 
ments of our public schools when they pursue a similar 
policy. 
And this is already being done, to a degree, in our 
best public schools. None of them has as yet reached 
the limit of possibilities in the premises, but many of 
them have made a start, a good start, in the right direc- 
tion. Some have failed in what they hoped for, but 
such failures have been largely their own fault. They 
have still stuck to the course —some fixed course— 
idea. They have tried to give their students a choice of 
several fixed and unvarying courses, rather than a truly 
- elective course, suited to individual needs. If a student 
took any “course,” he must take all of that course. 
This is better than one single course for all, but itis 
not good enough. But good enough will come lateron 
The plan, or method, that seems to be the best is to 
determine a minimum of attainment that must be reached 
by a pupil before a diploma can be secured. That is,4 
pupil must receive a certain number of credits for work 
done, before he or she can graduate. In such scale of 
credits, each particular study that it is possible to pursue 
in the school is given a certain credit value, and the sum 
of all these credits secured by the pupil must reach 4 
certain amount before any diploma will be issued to that 
pupil. Thus, suppose the total ctedits required for 
graduation be one hundred. In order to secure this 
number, successful work in Latin may count for s0 
much, algebra for so much, bookkeeping for so much, 
manual training for so much, etc. Each study succes 
fully pursued has a given credit value, and when the 
total credits amount to, say one hundred, or some other 
fixed number, then a diploma will be issued. The face
-P-A-G-E-209
CONCERNING COURSES OF STUDY 201 
of the diploma shows just what studies the holder has 
pursued, and how successfully he has done the work un- 
dertaken, 
If these studies are such as are required for entrance 
tocollege, well and good. Such diploma is a “sesame 
open” to any college of which the school issuing the 
diploma is accredited. But if a diploma is not of this 
sort, it is still an honor to the holder; for it shows that 
he or she has stayed in the school and has done success- 
ful work therein, and that is all that any or all can, or 
should, require. 
By such a plan each child can get what he needs out 
of our public schools, and no harm or hindrance will be 
done to any. Things being as they are, for some years 
yet the pupils who have college-entrance diplomas will 
becounted of somewhat higher rank, of somewhat better 
blood; but the plan will wear this feeling away, and in 
due time the honor will be assigned, not so much for 
holding this or that sort of diploma, as for what that 
document shows as to how well the work that it stands 
for has been done, whatever its kind may be. 
Nor does this mean chaos in our public schools. It 
does not mean that the pupil can study Latin a few 
Weeks, then drop it and take up something in its place, 
and then get credited for so many weeks’ Latin. Each 
pupil will be credited for work, in each several study, 
only when that study has been pursued successfully for 
the time needed for its mastery to the degree required 
by the school. In this way each pupil can come to his 
own, do the work which he and his advisers find to be 
best suited to his needs, and so the best results can be 
Secured for all parties concerned. Some day our schools 
will come to this, or something like it.

202. ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
This system has been pursued by the Galesburg, 
Illinois, high school for some years, and with the most 
remarkable success. Before adopting this plan, its grad- 
-uates rarely exceeded forty per year. At the end of six 
years’ use of the system, it graduated a class of one 
hundred and twenty-four for that year; and it prom 
ises to exceed that number each coming year, as time 
goes on. During this time, the attendance at the high 
school has increased two hundred and forty per cent, 
while the schools of the city as a whole have grown only 
forty per cent and the population of the city only twenty 
percent. .Each year more “classical” diplomas (college 
entrance diplomas) have been issued than ever before; 
and, in addition, twice as many “elective” diplomas 
have been issued to pupils who would have dropped 
out of school, or never entered the high school at all 
had it not been for the adaptation of the course of 
study to their individual needs. For the latest report 
from this school see figures already quoted in Chap 
ter XV. 
The teachers in this school report that they have 
very little or no trouble about pupils being fickle in thelr 
choice of studies— wanting to try first one and thea 
another. In the choice of studies, these pupils are by 
no means left to act alone, as I have before suggested 
they should not be, but the greatest care is taken to aid 
them to choose wisely and well. The aim is, especially 
in peculiar and unusual cases, to have such choice of 
studies made upon the joint counsel of superintendent, 
principal, teacher, parents, and pupil. Of course, this 
means work, but it is work that counts, that saves the 
boys and girls, keeps them in school when they ought 
to be kept in school, and makes them proud and happy
-P-A-G-E-211
CONCERNING COURSES OF STUDY 203 
over their success in doing well what they are severally 
capable of doing. 
After several years’ trial of this plan, all parties con- 
cerned are enthusiastic regarding it, and the record the 
school has made is proof positive of the merits of this 
method. What has been done in this case is only the 
advance guard of what will be done by all of our schools 
someday. Itis a practical demonstration of what can be 
done, in the right direction, by proper methods; and 
as the first telephone meant millions like it (and better 
as time went on) to follow it, so this school means mil- 
lions like it (and better, on similar lines) as the years 
pass by. Indeed, there are already a goodly number of 
schools trying this plan, with the best of results. 
And it is only a matter of time till the methods now 
Used in this high school will descend through the grades, 
fven to the lowest, in all our public schools. The 
principle is right, and time will bring its successful 
establishment. Under its benign workings, if a pupil 
fails or is “short” in some one or more studies in a 
grade, he will not be compelled to take a// the studies 
in that grade over again till he is able to “pass” on the 
one on which he is weak. 
Iknow that sentence will make many of my readers, 
Specially if they are teachers and believe in “the sys- 
tem,” wag their heads, and say, “ How are you going to 
doit?” And they may justly add, “ How, when we have 
such roomfuls of pupils to look after now, twice as 
Many as we can take care of as they ought to be taken 
Care of?” YT admit the pertinency of such questions, 
specially the last one. Nevertheless, the thing can be 
done, and it will be done, one day, for it is right. And 
the right will some day be done everywhere. To help
-P-A-G-E-212
20g; ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
bring that condition about is all that makes life worth 
living. 
This way of working in our public schools will not be 
effected in a day, or a year, or in several years. It 
must be slowly evolved. Public opinion must be 
aroused in its favor, and detailed methods developed for 
its establishment. But slowly and surely it will come, 
for only by such means can we educate all the children 
of all the people. 
Of course this means a greater range of work than 
most of our public schools now undertake, but all this 
can be provided for as the needs become manifest. It 
will undoubtedly increase the expense of these schools 
somewhat, but this need not give us anxiety. Only 
prove that these schools do the best possible thing for 
all the children of all the people, and these same people 
will see to it that the financial needs of these schools 
are provided for, to the uttermost limit. There need 
be no worry on that score. 
Now the chief changes that will be made in the work 
done in these schools, when pursued on a basis simular 
to the Galesburg plan, will be along industrial lines, B 
the introduction into them of manual training and do- 
mestic economy, not only in the high school, but in dif 
ferent forms, in all the grades, from top to bottom. This 
will come, not as.a fad, but as a necessity for doing the 
best we can for a very large percentage of the pupils 
that, as God has made our children (the way they at can only be reached successfully by such means. 
And this is not saying that the larger number of of 
children are low down in the scale of life or that they 
are far back in the procession. It is only taking the™ 
into account as they are, and acting accordingly.
-P-A-G-E-213

And, after all, what are our schools for but to estab- y- 
lish character in our children? What is the purpose of 
education, unless it be the formation of character in the 
individual? And when can an individual be said to be 
possessed of a character that is worthy of the name? 
That individual has character whose first desire in life, 
when he has anything to do, is first to find out the 
eternal and unvarying laws that make for the right doing 
of the deed he is called on to perform, and then, having 
found out these laws, to the best of his ability, whose 
single purpose it is to make his every act involved in the 
doing of the required deed tally with them. Such a 
man, such a woman, and such only, has character that 
1s worthy of the name. : 
Now bring manual training and domestic economy, 
48 means of character building (which is only another 
Word for true educational value) to this test and see how 
they compare with other things that have for so long 
been counted as their superiors. What the candidate 
for character has first to learn, learn so well that the 
lesson can never be forgotten and surely will not be 
forgotten in a few years after he leaves school, is the fact 
that God’s laws never apologize, and that every man’s 
Work shall be tried, of what sort it is, and that only such 
work as is done in accordance with these laws will stand. 
Experience is the only teacher which can impress this 
lesson upon the pupil so that it will stay. That may 
seem a hard saying, but we all know it is true. 
If you give a boy two boards that are to be matched 
together along the edges, so that they will make a perfect 
joint, and set him to work to bring about such a result, 
you have put such pupil “up against it” in a way that 
he cannot dodge. If he cuts too deep here, or leaves
-P-A-G-E-214
206 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
a bulge there, a crack will appear when he puts the two 
irregular edges together, and no mercy will be shown, 
No matter how his teacher may mark him, the falsehood 
of his work stands out against him in a way that cannot 
be hidden. So he learns the lesson of absolute compl: 
ance with God’s laws in relation to perfectly matched 
boards. He learns it by means of something that comes 
within the range of his comprehension, that he can 
understand, and thoroughly feel the force of. 
Or, give a girl a seam to sew, or 4 loaf to make and 
bake, and the same thing is true. She learns by 
practical experience that only by compliance with 
unvarying law can she obtain results that are really 
worthy. Her work is within the limit of her ability 
and her comprehension, and so is of value to her. And 
so such work tends to build up a regard for truth in the 
child; and, in time, an honest belief in it, faith in it 
love for it, in no uncertain way. 
A principal of a large high school once told me that 
the typewriter was one of the greatest moral forces he 
had in his school. He said he had put boys and girls at 
work upon it who could not and would not spell well 
when they wrote with a pen or pencil. But when these 
same pupils were placed where their spelling sins stared 
them in the face, as they did from a typewritten pags 
that was too much for them, and they would mend their 
ways. There is great wisdom in this record of facts. 
But now give the everyday boy or girl a Latin set 
tence to translate, or a lesson in history or geography 
to memorize merely, and see how these compare, 3 
character builders, for such children, with the work just 
noted. Mind, I am speaking of the “everyday boy of 
girl.” I readily admit that for those pupils who love
-P-A-G-E-215
CONCERNING COURSES OF STUDY 207 
translate Latin there is, in the exercise, that which tends 
to the formation of character in them. If they are born 
to function in that mental plane, well and good. But 
most boys and girls are not so born; and to make them 
go through the motions, with these studies to which they 
do not respond, does not tend to establish character in 
them. 
There are millions of boys and girls in this country 
who can and will vibrate and respond to industrial train- 
ing, in a way that will establish character in them of no 
uacertain sort, boys and girls who cannot. and will not 
Vibrate and respond to bookwork, to amount to much. 
Such method of training will keep them in school at a 
time of life when they need to be in school, and when 
they could not be kept, are not kept, by a regular clas- 
Sicalcollege-fashioned schoo} course. 
; It should go without saying that this industrial work 
8 not suited to the needs of a// children, any more than 
clssical work is suited to the needs of all children. 
There are a goodly number of children who never ought 
to take such work, to any considerable extent. If they 
do not function in that plane, and do function in some 
other, well and good. Let them hum where they can, 
where God made them to respond, and so shall it be 
well with them. 
It would be as much a sin to try to make all the 
children match boards, or bake bread, as it has been to 
ty to make them all take a classical course of study. 
h in his own way, so long as that way interferes 
with no other, does no harm or wrong, is the law; and 
the law should have freedom to run and be glorified for 
each particular child. 
And, after all, what more excellent work can our

schools engage in than fitting our boys and girls todo 
the things that pertain to practical life —things that 
will be of service to them in their homes and tend to 
make these homes fit places for first class American citi 
zens to live in? What better can our public schools do 
for our children than to fit them to become worthy in- 
mates of divinely managed homes— homes that are 
ordered in accordance with God’s laws, and so are bits 
of heaven on earth? Such results will answer the prayer 
“Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” This is 
work that is worthy the backing of the state, the eamest 
support of every citizen. To produce such results, it is 
right to tax all the people; and if they are forthcoming, 
the money to pay for them will be furnished without 
grumbling. But not otherwise.

Probable Slow Growth of Proposed Changes — Memory Work to be 
made Less Prominent — Memory a most Treacherous Faculty — 
Little relied on in the Business World —“The Memories” — 
Specializing Abilities — Professor Olmstead —Author’s Experi- 
ence— Memory Extortion —“ Shall 1 Pass?” — Colleges respon- 
sible for this Condition. 
Tus establishment of this new order of things in our 
schools must of necessity be a matter of slow growth. 
There is so much to be done, our present methods are 
$0 firmly seated in their places, and the way before us is 
also new and untried, that progress can only be made 
by degrees. There will be many mistakes, plenty of 
dscouragements, and numberless I-told-you-so’s. But, 
in spite of all these, we shall get on, “The goal is 
famed, and it cannot be countermanded.” 
Pethaps one of the first changes in method that we 
shall attempt will be in the matter of memory work, 
¥hich now so largely obtains in our schools. Now, for 
the most part, we try to have our pupils memorize what is 
set down in books. The change will be in that we shall, 
instead, teach them how to use books. If we can do 
that successfully, we shall have put them into the line of 
oming educated men and women, so far as book 
knowledge is concerned. And that is enough, on that 
fide, 
The fact is, the thoughtful people of the world are 
Xow coming to see that memory is not the regal trait in 
> 209
-P-A-G-E-218
210 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
one’s intellectual outfit that it was once supposed to be 
On the contrary, we are coming to understand that itisthe 
most treacherous and tricky, not to say dangerous, of all 
the mental activities. Practically no one to-day, who has 
regard for things strictly as they are, places any absolute 
reliance whatever upon memory as a tally sheet, The 
banker, the merchant, the physician, the scientist, the 
mechanic, the railroader, all men and women who have 
to deal with what we call practical things —none of 
these rely upon memory for their data. They have 
learned by experience, often of the bitterest kind, how 
utterly unreliable memory is. So they have ceased to 
count it as anything more than a sort of temporary asset 
in their mental furnishing. 
This is not saying that memory, in its proper sphere 
and function, has ceased to be of value; — it has its 
place in our mental furnishing, and always will have — 
But it does mean, first, that memory training, as it wat 
once exploited, as a means of educational growth and 
development, is not the potent factor for that end that 
it was once counted to be. It means that merely teach 
ing achild to repeat what is set down in a book has # 
it very little that is of real educative value. It means 
that there is now very little necessity for such work, aud 
that the only reason for its still remaining in our schools 
as in large measure it does, is the fact that it has always 
been there. . 
Besides all this, the most recent, thoroughly scientifi 
and entirely reliable investigations of modern psycholo 
gists have revealed the fact that there is no such thing 
as “the memory,” as it was formerly considered. It 
stead of this, these men have shown that in each humad 
mind there are “the memories,” a whole lot of them
-P-A-G-E-219
SOME OTHER CHANGES 2Ir 
and all so different! And this discovery will, in due 
time, change the whole matter of memory training, as it 
has been exploited for centuries. 
We all know, too, that this but recent announcement 
of what has always been a fact, tallies exactly with things 
asthey are. Everyone’s personal experience proves that 
this is true. Everybody has a good memory for some 
things, and a very poor one for some other things! Isn’t 
itso in your case? It is in mine, and in everyone else’s 
that I know anything about. I have a splendid memory, 
along certain lines, as I have already said. But for some 
other things — I am glad I don’t have to tell that side of 
the story ! 
Nor need I do so, because what is true of me is 
tqually true of you, whoever you are, only in a differ- 
cat way. You can remember some things easily enough. 
Some you simply cannot forget, though you may ever 
% much wish that you could. Other things you cannot 
femember at all. And what is true of you and me is 
tue of all the rest of our brothers and sisters, all over 
the world —is true of all the people, and of all the chil- 
dren of all the people. 
The best memory for places and for faces that I ever 
knew about was possessed by an idiot who could not be 
taught to count ten. Blind Tom had a phenomenal 
memory for music, and would duplicate a piano per- 
formance, half an hour long, upon a single hearing. 
Professor Olmstead carried a whole table of logarithms 
inhis memory, and I once had a teacher in history who 
could give, from memory, almost any date to be found 
in a cyclopedia. He tried to make me do the same 
thing, and I ruined my health for life, trying to do 
What he did and wanted me to do also. He was a good
-P-A-G-E-220
212. ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
man and I respected and loved him so much, and had » 
much faith in him, that I felt I was in duty bound to do 
as he asked me. 
He said I had a good memory, because I could repeat 
verses as I did. (I used to repeat poetry to him, and he 
liked to have me do so. He couldn’t do that, but in 
those days he didn’t count that as a significant factor 
in the matter of what I could remember, and what he 
could not.) So he set out to make me as proficient ia 
the matter of remembering dates as he was. I broke 
my health at the task, and it was all so senseless, 90 
utterly useless and entirely abominable, as I see it now. 
I have no ability at all for that sort of thing. I cr 
not vibrate in the least in that plane. I can’t even 
member the birthdays of my brothers and sisters; and, 
if my life were at stake, I could not, right here and now 
by the aid of my memory alone, tell when Van Burta 
was President, or the year in which Edward VII was 
crowned king. And yet my teachers used to say thal 
I had a good memory. 
You know just how it is, too, do you not? Well, then 
since these things are so, let us act in accordance with 
things as they are, in the matter of memory, when ¥ 
try to educate all the children of all the people. ' 
For, why should I bother my head about my brothers 
and sisters’ birthdays? The family register keeps all 
that information, in reliable form. So, also, the enc 
clopedia tells all about Mr. Van Buren and Edward vil. 
Had my history teacher taught me the true use of # 
cyclopedia, and spent the rest of the time in a history 
class in interesting me in men and deeds, and their re 
tion each to each, to the past and to what is to come, OY 
history work in school would then have been of som
-P-A-G-E-221
SOME OTHER CHANGES 213 
value to me, and would not have ruined my health. 
As it was, I look back upon it now as a horrible experi- 
ence that I was once compelled to undergo, and my back 
aches, as I write, because of the physical and nervous 
breakdown that came to me as a result of the strain that 
I put myself to in trying to do this and similar (to me) 
useless work in school. 
Yet I had schoolmates who did this work and grew 
fat on it, They vibrated to that sort of thing. I did 
not. Why could not my teachers, who were good men 
and women, every one of them, in other ways, why 
couldn't they have seen that it was folly, yes, wicked, 
for them to try to make a date-holder out of my head, 
orto make me a master of languages? I never had, or 
showed, the least ability in either of these directions; 
and what once was, still is. Yet it was held that it 
would cultivate my memory to do such work, that it 
Would discipline my mind and educate me, and so I 
undertook it. It was a failure, from start to finish. 
Worse than that, the work I tried to do was @ sin 
against my being, and I shall suffer for that sin just as 
long as I live. My teachers did not mean it so, and I 
have heard them all tell how sin could be forgiven. 
I wish they could tell me how to get rid of the pain and 
Weakness I now suffer from, and which the work they 
Save me was the cause of. 
I don’t like to say these things, and my only reason 
for doing so is the hope that this true record may keep 
‘me teacher or teachers, or parents, or pupils, from 
doing asI did in these respects. 
And so, in the order of things, the terrible burdens of 
Nemory work that we now put upon the pupils of our 
Public schools will one day be relegated to the back-
-P-A-G-E-222
214 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
ground, where they really belong; and in their stead 
will come teaching how to use books, and how to do 
things. Of course, if, now and then, a boy or gid 
delights in repeating what is set down in a book, in 
memorizing dates, and such like work, such should le 
permitted to do all this. But the larger part of ow 
children will not go that way. Neither will they be 
dropped out of school, if they cannot, or do not, go that 
way. 
Will you who read these lines, be you teacher, parent 
or pupil, think of how these things are with you; and 
then will you try to do the best you can for your pupils 
your children, or yourself, on these counts? Be honest 
with yourselves right here. That’s all I ask. 
Next, this change that will come in our schools along 
the line of memory work wiil naturally lead to the 
elimination of that black beast of every pupil's sched 
life, examinations, as they for the most part now am 
and as they have been conducted, time out of mind. 
For here, also, we are still held in bondage by whit 
has come to us from the days when there were no such 
means for doing things as we now have. Examint 
tions, as they are now almost universally conducted i# 
our schools, are only the culminating climax of tt 
memory training that is done in these schools, Itis# 
memory extortion, pure and simple. It is supposed ® 
be the final twist which will forever fix in the memofy, 
as awhole, the items that have been put into it one# 
atime. Its mission is supposed to be that of a sort 
solidifier, a. forcing into one compact and nondestrit 
tible lump what has previously been a floating mas 
of stuff. With this for a theory, the memory examitt 
tion screws are put on; and oh, the agony which tht
-P-A-G-E-223
SOME OTHER CHANGES 215 
pressure inflicts upon those who fall under its relentless 
squeezing — that is, practically, upon all the pupils of 
the school! Racks and thumbscrews of the olden 
time were never more cruel and tormenting. “ Shall 
Ipass?” “Did you pass?” “Iam afraid I shall not 
pass.” “I can’t sleep a wink till I know whether I 
have passed or not!” How many times have you 
heard these words? How many times have you said 
them yourself, and experienced the anguish they ex- 
Press? And yet they are really needless, and wholly 
wcalled-for words, if only these things are done as they 
ought to be. 
Why should we longer put our children to these ter- 
tible strains, as we now do? I ask you why? Will you 
op and try to think out a good reason? I have tried 
to think out a good reason, and I am unable to do so. 
But here is all the excuse I cam find for this fearful 
abuse of what was once a good thing: 
_ The ultimate and only reason for this sort of thing 
is the demand of the colleges that we prepare pupils to 
undergo the entrance examinations which they set up 
for admission to their institutions. That is the whole 
story in a nutshell, as every one who is familiar with 
the facts will readily admit. That is the final fact, and 
it is a fact that requires looking into. That shall be 
done in the following chapter.

In taking up the subject to be considered in this chap

will ever shrink from being brought to a fair test as 
his ability to do well any work that he may wish to ue 
dertake. More than that (or rather, previous to that),it 
is only just, fair, and right that every person who seeks 
for place or position, or for opportunity to do work of 
any kind, should be submitted to a fair test of his ability 
to “fill the bill,” if I may say it that way. 
I am no advocate for /aissez faire methods, ot for 
slipshod, happy-go-lucky ways of doing things, here & 
anywhere. I make no plea that the slouch, the in 
cient, and the ne’er-do-weels should not be tested as 
their real worth. But I do plead for the millions of ouf 
children who now live in agony all the school yeas 
of their lives because of this dragon of antiquated & 
amination methods which are now so universally ramp 
ant in our schools. I know that, in some of our best 
216
-P-A-G-E-225
EXAMINATIONS 214 
schools, this demon has been exorcised. But the list of 
such schools is small. We all know that fact. 
lam sure it will help to make clear what I wish to say, 
to review, somewhat in detail, the examination methods 
of the past, to see how they came into being, and what 
they have now become. 
Like most other present evils, the bad things about 
modern school examinations have all come out of that 
which was once good in its way, in its own day and 
place. Memory examination tests were once the only 
way of proving the status of pupils who wished to pu” 
sue further scholarly work. That was wholly the cas: 
in the days when there were no books, or very few t 
speak of. Among all ancient peoples, and in all sucl 
times, this method was the only one that could be usec! 
and that was where the method was developed, and ho: 
itcame into use. It was once right and just and wise — 
the best that could be done, then and there. 
Besides this, these tests were in harmony with the 
ways in which pupils in those times received all their 
instruction. They were taught by word of mouth, and 
by word of mouth they reproduced what they had been 
taught. 
As amatter of fact, it is doubtful if Socrates ever 
Wrote a line, and the same can truthfully be said of 
Jesus. There is not, in all the world, to-day, a single 
Stroke of pen, pencil, or stylus that either of these made 
with his own hand. Socrates talked to his pupils, and 
Jesus opened his mouth and taught the people, saying. 
There were few books then —surely none for all of the 
children of all the people. These, and other teachers 
of those times, taught without books, and only what 
they themselves knew at first hand. Furthermore, the
-P-A-G-E-226
218 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
teachers of those days did not teach so very much— 
very little, surely, compared with what pupils are taught 
to-day. 
Then, in those early times, each teacher would teach 
the pupil only what he himself (the teacher) knew, and 
in some cases that was not very much. Indeed, if such 
process were in vogue now, the sufferings of our children 
would be greatly mitigated! But, see! No teacheris 
now confined in his teaching to what he himself knows! 
He now has books without number, as his aiders and 
abettors, and he can assign pages and pages of them for 
pupils to memorize while he himself goes home, and 
perhaps to bed, and to sleep. 
And then, when recitation hour comes, the teacher 
can sit down with the open book before him, and, with 
finger on the text, can keep tab on the pupil ! Will you 
stop and think how such accrued advantage on one side 
of what was once a fair game has resulted to the dit 
advantage of the other side? The situation is the mos 
monstrous, the most unjust and unfair method of work 
that exists, anywhere in the world to-day. 
This is no fable that Iam rehearsing. I am not fight 
ing a man of straw in what I am saying here. Every 
child, every parent, every teacher in this country knows 
the truth. The marvel is that we are all as patient 
we are.in the presence of this persistent evil, this relic 
of ancient days that still abides with us. 
Take a case in point. Suppose a boy in the old days 
(or new, for that matter) was learning a language °) 
word-of-mouth method, getting his vocabulary from 
teacher, and having the forms of words and their arrange 
ment and relations all explained and illustrated, vocal 
as the study progressed. Now, nothing could be fairet
-P-A-G-E-227
EXAMINATIONS 219 
under such circumstances, if a test of the pupil’s pro- 
ficiency was to be made, than to subject him to a 
memory examination, to ask him to repeat words that 
he had learned, etc. — in a word, to see if he could talk 
as he had been taught to talk, as it would be fair to 
presume he should be able to talk, his instruction being 
what it had been. No one could object to such a test. 
It would be fair to all parties concerned, and it would 
prove what one would wish to find out. 
But now, compare this with the modern examinations 
of the pupils in our schools, and of candidates for teach- 
ing in our schools, since the advent of books. 
Take the same study I have considered above, the 
examination in some language which the pupil has 
been trying to learn with books as the chief means, 
which is the method still used in nearly all language 
study in our public schools. Just see the difference in 
the two cases, and how fearfully to the disadvantage 
of the pupil the present way is. By this method, the 
Pupil gets his knowledge of words by the eye, from a 
dictionary of the language he is studying; and at least 
fifty of these words are given him in this way where 
one would be given if the teacher alone were the source 
of word supply. The dictionary is always at hand, 
when the pupil is studying his lesson, and so can be re- 
ferred to at will. Besides this, the grammar is always 
accessible, to explain new and unusual forms and phrases 
thatappear in the text. That is, the lexicon and the gram- 
Mar are the legitimate tools which the pupil can use to 
advantage in his work. He uses them, learns to depend 
on them, as he has a right to do, and in this way does 
More or less language work. 
But when examination day comes, every one of these
-P-A-G-E-228
220 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
rightful and useful helps in his work ts taken away from 
' him, and at arm’s length of memory alone he is asked to 
translate, give forms of words, and account for construe 
tions, without any assistance whatever from the vols that 
he ordinarily has been permitted to use. 
But, it is contended, this is seldom on new work. An 
examination is usually upon subject matter which the 
pupil has had. Granted. But it is getting to be about 
time for us to learn that the mind of a pupil is not like 
\ private compartment in a safety deposit bank vault 
vhich can be relied upon to hold securely whatever is 
once put into it. It is far more like a sponge which 
lies in the open air. It may be sopped till it drips; but 
the wind passes over it, and what was in it is gone, till 
it is soon as dry as a dead leaf lying on a parched rock. 
Perhaps it is more like a sieve which will only hold 
stuff put into it that is larger than its meshes. 
In any event, the fact is thoroughly patent to any 
impartial observer that this way of testing a pupil’ 
ability is wholly unfair and grossly stupid, and that it 
puts into the hands of a careless, or a cold-blooded 
teacher a means of torture which the Inquisition neve 
surpassed. 
Just see what a boy or girl is supposed to have “ot 
tap,” in memory, ready to be drawn on at an instant’s 
notice, in order that he or she may pass a colleg¢ 
entrance examination. Take it in mathematics alone, 
and in the single study of geometry. It is perfectly 
safe to say that such pupil is liable to be called on to 
give, or to work with, any one, or half dozen, out of 4 
hundred theorems. It is equally safe to say that not 
more than one such pupil in a hundred ever has any- 
thing more than a memory knowledge of geometry, at
-P-A-G-E-229
EXAMINATIONS 221 
the age of college entrance. The study is one that 
very few people vibrate to before they are thirty years 
of age, and not so very many even then. 
Ionce asked, in an audience of five hundred high 
school teachers and city superintendents, how many 
were able to go to the board and divide a line in 
extreme and mean ratio; and there were less than a 
score who were able to do it, right then and there! 
Upon bringing these to the test, I found that they were 
all teachers of geometry, who were fresh from the work! 
And yet, every boy and girl who has to be brought to . 
the test of a college entrance examination in geometry 
must be prepared, not only to divide a line in extreme 
and mean ratio, but to do more than a hundred equally 
difficult things, few of which those learned men and 
women who sat before me that morning could do, if 
they were called on as I called on them. 
And they were not incompetent men and women, 
these teachers who could not divide a line as asked, on 
the drop of the hat. On the contrary, they were among 
the ablest teachers in this or any other country, and 
there was not one amongst them all who could not 
divide a line as required, if they could have had their 
books If 
What a flood of light these last seven words throw 
Upon the situation. 
And why should not these teachers be permitted to 
have their books to use in dividing a line, or,in doing a 
thousand and one other things which they learned how 
to do with the aid of books, and which they can do 
easily enough if they are permitted to use those same 
books now, as they once used them? And why should 
these pupils of ours, month after month, and year after

222 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
year, be compelled to pass examinations in books, with 
out books? Can any one tell? The omily reasons are 
that it has always been so; that as the fathers did, sodo 
we; and that the colleges demand that these things 
continue to be done in this way. But it is an outrage, 
a shame and a disgrace, a sin of the most deadly sort 
against our pupils that these methods be longer re 
tained. 
How much Latin or Greek can you read without lex- 
con or grammar? Be honest now! How many people 
do you know who can read these languages to amount 
to much without these helps? How many teachers of 
these languages do you know who do not have to pre- 
pare for the work of each such lesson in advance, by the 
use of lexicon or grammar? More than that, how many 
teachers do you know who, when they set themselves to 
mark up a set of examination papers, do not fortify 
themselves with lexicon and grammar, to prove whether 
the work is correct? I have seen this done scores of 
times. So have you. I have done the thing myself 
So have you. And we did no wrong in using these 
books, either. Our only wrong was in not permitting 
our pupils to do as we did. 
Shall we, then, abolish college entrance examinations 
and corresponding work in our public schools? By 10 
means. All that needs to be done is simply to abolish 
the antiquated and wholly useless method that is now is 
vogue, and, in its place, use a method that is rational, 
and in accordance with modern means and appliances 
That is, since we live in an age of books, when evety- 
body has them and can have them continually, whet 
there is no need whatever of burdening the memory 
with data as there used to be — since all these things af

50, let us mend our examination ways and test our pupils 
as to how well they can use books, rather than how per- ~ 
fectly (or imperfectly) they can repeat what is in them. 
That will remedy the whole difficulty, and will remove. 
all the trouble on that score, and will lift a load from the 
backs of our pupils in comparison of which mountains 
are but pebbles. , 
And what a change this will make in the bookwork 
of our schoolrooms. Think of geography, and history, 
and literature, when taught by this method. Who would 
not gladly undertake these studies, on such a basis as is 
here proposed? What boy or girl did we ever know 
who did not respond to the reading of history, or of 
geography, full of live data—stories of men, things, 
and places that had life in them, and that it was a 
delight to know about? See how we have all learned 
about the Philippines, and Russia, and Japan, in the last 
few years, from what we have read out of the news- 
Papers and magazines! We do not remember it all. 
Surely not. We could not pass a written examination 
upon it, But we remember all that is needful to be 
Temembered, and what we forget we can “look up,” and 
that is enough. 
Under this new order of things, we will educate all 
our pupils by methods that they will use when they come 
into the practical affairs of life. Then, if we wish to - 
test a boy’s proficiency in history, we will give him an 
historical subject to investigate, put the proper books 
into his hands, and see what comes of it. The same 
in Latin, or Greek, or philosophy, or mathematics. 
This is what the boy will come to in the work of life, 
and this work that we give him will be excellent practice 
for him while he is learning how to do things; and all
-P-A-G-E-232
224 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
the children of all the people can learn to do things this 
way, each after his own plan. 
Is a lawyer asked to pass upon a case? His ability 
to do this is by no means confined to his memory. He 
has his own library, and that of his fellows in his pro- 
fession, to refer to. The same is true of the physician, 
the preacher, the teacher, and of all book-professional 
men and women. It is equally true of the craftsman, 
and of all workers in whose callings the records to be 
found in books are of use. Likewise in all the business 
world, the use of books, their handling, consulting, and 
studying —these are all factors of chief importance. 
The banker relies on his books and not on his memory 
— that is, if he isa good banker. So does the merchant, 
and the manufacturer, and even the farmer is coming to 
work in the same way. 
So, what our children need, so far as books are con 
cerned, is to be taught how to use them. This is 
especially true of all and everything on the side of lit 
erature, and of literary culture and training. I saw a 
class in literature, so called, the other day, where the 
work consisted of the pupils’ standing and telling, 
from memory, the names of authors, when they were 
born, where they were born, how long they lived, what 
books they wrote, when they died, where they died, and 
where they were buried. At the end of each month 
they are required to pass a written examination on what 
they have learned! I have before me, as I write, a set 
of college entrance examinations for the year 1910, in 
which this sort of work in literature is called for, and 
required! Indeed, a teacher who taught literature in 
the public schools by this method told me that she was 
compelled to do as she did in order to fit her pupils to
-P-A-G-E-233
EXAMINATIONS 225 
pass college entrance examinations. She said the col- 
leges with which their school was affiliated all required 
such work, And there you are again! 
What can, or does, such study of literature amount to? 
Absolutely nothing. Yes, often worse than nothing. 
For the boredom of it, and the agony that it inflicts 
upon the pupil, create a hatred of literature that is often 
never overcome. Such a method is dead, and should 
be buried. It is a stench in the nostrils of any true 
lover of literature, or of any live teacher of the subject. 
Would I know the literary standing of an individual? 
Let him bring to me any book he has read, I care not 
whether I have ever seen or heard of the book or of its 
author before, and read to me what he counts of most 
Worth in the volume, and I can very soon judge of his 
literary accomplishments and standing. So can you. 
can any one who is fair-minded, and open to evi- 
dence that is worth while. There need be no trouble 
inthis sort of examination work. It can be well and 
faithfully done, with full justice to all parties concerned. 
And the best of it is that such a method will demon- 
strate what it is set to prove. It will also free our 
Pupils from a slavery that has long held them in bond- 
age. Furthermore, it will entirely remove all tempta- 
tion to cheat in examination, a practice that has done 
More to undermine the morals of students, in recent 
Years, than any other one source of evil that can be 
tamed or imagined. It will make study a delight, and 
the proof of one’s attainments a test to be desired 
Tather than a trial to be shunned. The time it will save 
our students and teachers will make room for the work 
that our schools must do, for manual training and 
domestic economy, for work in many practical things 
Q
-P-A-G-E-234
226 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
which the schools need, and which we now “have no 
time for”; it will usher in a new day in our school 
world, one that will bring joy to the hearts of teachers, 
pupils, and parents, and positive profit to them all. 
Such methods of study and of examinations as I have 
outlined will accommodate themselves to the way we 
are, every one of us, and to the way everybody else is, 
and everything else is. And so we will be happy and 
geton. As heaven is to the other place, so will the con- 
ditions of our pupils then be to the fix they are now in. 
Time was when the word “scholar” meant a walking 
dictionary and an autocyclopedia, and all the methods 
and paraphernalia of the schools were brought into play 
to effect such a result. As language and the volume 
of things known were in those days, all these things 
might be packed into one head and the man be none 
the worse for it. But as things are now, an effort to 
produce such a result is fatal to the victims. There are 
too many words now, and knowledge has too vast 4 
reach, to be compressed any longer into any one single 
head. Besides, what’s the use? Dictionaries are 50 
cheap. The millions can have cyclopedias now; and 
things are so much easier to get at, so much more reli- 
able withal, so much more liable to keep in any climate, 
when preserved for use in this way. 
Even China has largely abandoned her memory-test 
examinations for political preferment, and the whole 
system has been abolished by imperial edict in Japat- 
These nations have used these methods for centuries in 
their educational work, but they have now come to se 
that, in the light of modern means and methods, they 
are of little or no account. So they have marked them 
off their educational maps. Wise people, they.
-P-A-G-E-235
EXAMINATIONS 224 
The simple truth is, that these memory-test examina- 
tion methods must be abolished in this country also — 
dropped, all along the line. They are now held in place 
in our public schools almost solely because the colleges 
require that they be kept there, and that is not a good 
and sufficient reason for their being longer endured. 
All that the colleges have right to ask of a candi- 
date for admission to their doors is that he prove that 
he is ftted and able to do the work that they require. 
This can be learned by an examination of how well the 
candidate can use books, and do things, far better than 
by how well he can merely repeat what is in books. 
And it will be that way, some day.

Tragedy of it al — Why the Aimless Methods are bad in a De

“One Bird at a Shot ”— Lowell’s Definition of a University. 
ANOTHER change that will come with this new order 
of things in our schools will be the practice, on the part 
of our pupils, of studying for some definite purpose in 
life, rather than merely “to get an education” and then 
“wait for something to turn up.” There is no one item 
in the educational work of the young people of to-day 
which leads to more disastrous results than the aimless 
methods of study which are now so generally practiced. 
The change that is needed will perhaps affect more 
largely the work done in our colleges and universities 
than in our public schools, but it will have to be largely 
introduced, even in the more elementary work of all our 
children. 
I have said that such aimless study, this idea of 
merely getting a good education, results badly; and! 
wish to emphasize that statement. That it is true, 00 
one who is familiar with the facts will deny. That any- 
thing can be done about it, most people either doubt of 
refuse to consider. 
I have no word to say against scholastic work in out 
public schools, or in our colleges and universities, pro 
vided such work be done with some definite end in view.

-P-A-G-E-237
SHOOTING TO HIT 229 
But to pursue any course of study just for the sake of 
studying something, just to become “cultured,” just to 
get a good education —this is as dangerous as it is 
foolish, unless one has money enough so that he can, 
for the most part, live without work. You may not have 
thought it that way, but if you will stop to consider 
the facts in the case, you will find them as I have just 
Stated. : 
Icannot illustrate the situation better than by giving 
acase that came under my observation a few months 
ago. A prominent merchant in this country told me 
the story as we were riding together in a Pullman, 
and I will repeat it as he gave it to me. We had been 
talking about this matter of aimless work in school, and 
he finally said : — 
“You are right, Mr. Smith. It is a sin before God 
for a boy to go through college without a definite pur- 
Pose in life, a positive something which he aims to hit— 
tither for him to do this for himself, or for his parents 
fo permit him to do so. And I'll tell you how I know 
what I am talking about.” He then went on, as follows: 
“T have two boys. The older one is now thirty-seven. 
He is married, has a good wife and four children that 
Will average well with children as they go, which is as 
Moderate a way of saying it as ought to be expected 
ftom a grandfather! He is a recognized factor in our 
tity affairs, has his place in our church; and, not to 
boast, is a son that a father may well rejoice in, not to 
saybe a bit proud of. He is really the head of our 
business house, though I am nominally to the fore. I 
have just been East buying goods, for I have some good 
stuf in me yet, if I am past seventy; but if anything 
thould happen to me, my son could carry on the busi-
-P-A-G-E-238
230 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
ness with perfect success. He knows the details of our 
trade from top to bottom, and is thoroughly master of 
the situation. We have no tremendous concern,” he 
added modestly ; “but we manage to turn over three or 
four million dollars a year, take it one year with another. 
I began the business in a small way as a young man, 
and it has grown to what it now is. 
“Now this older boy of mine never took to books 
much. But he was our firstborn, and his mother was 
very anxious that he should have a good education, 
one very much better than mine, for I never had an 
opportunity to go to school very much when I was 
young. So we kept the boy in school, one way or an- 
other, till he finished the high school course, in a way. 
It was a kind of a ‘scratch,’ but they finally let him 
graduate. Then his mother wanted him to go to col- 
lege. But the boy rebelled. He said he would be 
willing to do almost anything for his mother (he was 
a good boy), but that what she asked was too much. 
He said that he wanted to go into the store. 
“ Well, his mother and I talked it over, and she cried 
about it some, but we finally concluded that we'd do 4 
the boy wished ; and so he went into the store. I started 
him at three dollars a week. He was seventeen years 
old, and he had graduated from the high school; but 
three dollars a week was all he could earn, to start 00; 
and in business it is what one can earn, and not what 
diploma he has, that counts. 
“That was twenty years ago, and during those years 
the boy has grown up through the business till he is 
now, practically, the head of the house. He is able to 
take care of himself and his family, he is a good citizeh, 
and a respected and worthy part of the community be

lives in. That is, it seems to me he is a success, a man 
whose life is really worth while.” 
Here the narrator paused a minute, looked out of the 
cat window thoughtfully for a brief space, and then 
went on: — 
“Now I have another boy, four years younger than the 
one l have just told you about.. He is naturally just as 
good a boy as his brother, and is very much brighter in 
books, He always led his classes, and was greatly 
loved and admired by his teachers and his fellow students. 
“He graduated from the high school at seventeen; 
and then, because he wanted to go to college, his mother 
ind I were only too glad to have him do so. So we sent 
him to Yale for four years, where he made a record that 
Was as good as he had made in school at home. He 
took a complete classical course, studied everything that 
Acultured gentleman ought to study, and came through 
lust that, just a cultured gentleman. He didn’t try to fit 
self for anything in particular — just aimed to get a melas education, as it is generally counted, and he 
it 
“When he got through at Vale, he wanted to do some 
Post-graduate work across the water — nothing definite, 
but only in the line of general culture, which he was very 
fond of. We could afford to do this for him; for, though 
Tam not a tich man, yet I had enough to let the boy do 
Whe liked about his education. So he spent two years in 
“many and France, studying there; and then, to give 
him all that could be had, I paid his expenses for two 
Yeats of travel, during which he visited the principal 
Countries and cities of the world. 
“And then he came home! He was a handsome 
fellow, twenty-five years old, cultured, refined, polished ;.
-P-A-G-E-240
232 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
a gentleman and a scholar in the full sense of those words 
He was a man of good habits, had kept himself clean and 
decent on the moral side of his life, in a word he was an 
‘ideal gentleman.’ 
“That's what he was in the eyes of the world. But, 
as a matter of fact, he was as helpless a mortal, so far as 
' earning a living (at least such a living as he had always 
had, such a one as I had given him, and as he was 
thoroughly used to) was concerned, as he was when he 
was a boy in knickerbockers! He simply couldn't do 
anything ; and the worst of it was, he didn’t want to do 
anything. That is, anything that meant work for pay: 
As a matter of fact, there was little or nothing that he 
could do, unless it was to teach; and he couldn’t eam 
money enough at that to keep him in neckties —not the 
kind of neckties he had been used to wearing. ; 
“And so the question finally came up what to do with 
him. We tried him in the store, but it was no good. 
He didn’t know a thing about the business, and he was 
too old and too proud to learn. He couldn't start in on 
three dollars a week, and work his way up. He had 
got away past such a possibility; and yet, practically, 
that is about the only way a business like ours cam be 
learned, so as to be a master of it. In our business 
(yes, in any business), the details have to be mastered, if 
its pursuit is made a success. And this he simply could 
not learn; nor can any one do this, situated as he was 
and that is the terribly hard thing about it. 
“You see, his habits of life were none of them based 
on business principles. He loved to sleep late in the 
morning, and he wanted to have my coachman bring 
him down to the store whenever he got ready to come 
Sometimes he would get down by eight, and sometimes
-P-A-G-E-241
SHOOTING TO HIT 233 
not till eleven. We put him on the correspondence, but 
itwas a failure. He could write an article for a maga- 
tine, or a thesis for a degree; but he couldn’t write a 
business letter, one that would be of value in our busi- 
ness. He hadn’t the knowledge of details that was 
required for writing such a letter. We tried him asa 
salesman on the road, but he was a failure, every- 
where. 
“And as for entering a profession, — as the law, or 
medicine, or the pulpit, at his time of life, he had no more 
show there than he had in our business. He was be- 
hind in the procession in everything but being a cul- 
tured gentleman; and there he was only fitted to be 
taken care of by somebody else, to have some one else 
Fry the bills. There was nothing that he could do that 
Would bring him twenty dollars a week. No one could 
afford to pay him even so much, for he couldn’t earn it 
atanything that he could turn his hand to. 
“He is now thirty-three years old, right in the prime 
of his young manhood. He isn’t married, and I doubt 
ithe ever will be. I’d be glad to have him marry, and 
to settle enough on him to take care of him in a modest 
way. But he is too proud for that. And I couldn't give 
him an allowance which would meet the requirements 
of himself and such a woman as he would want to marry, 
ithe married at all. 
“And so, Mr. Smith, there is only one word that will 
desctibe the condition of this son of mine, to-day, and 
that is the terrible word ‘failure!’ That is the saddest 
Yord I know anything about, especially when it describes 
the condition of a capable young life.” 
There were tears in the old man’s eyes as he said 
this, And then we both looked out of the car window
-P-A-G-E-242
234 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
for a long time, and said nothing. But after awhile he 
went on :— 
“ And so I say that if I had a score of boys, I would 
never permit another one of them to get a purposeless 
education. This tragedy in our boy’s life is the result 
of our own false notions. I don’t know that we are to 
blame, or that he is to blame; but we are all suffering 
from a great mistake, and what the end is to be, God 
only knows.” 
Now this is no “made-up story,” good people. It is 
“the real thing”; and you know its duplicates, or per 
haps scores of just such cases. And isn’t it tragedy of 
the “most deepest dye”? Such cases are seen evety- 
where, and their number is on the increase daily. Fut 
thermore, it is as true of young women as it is of young 
men. And the pathos of it is immeasurable! 
Of course, it is easy to see that all this is but another 
relic of other days. These young people, who do as 
have described, are only following in the ways of the 
sons and daughters of the nobility across the water, of 
young people who, according to the code, are born # 
be taken care of; who never work, nor need to think 
of earning their own living. That is the way of mor 
archy, and under such a régime it doubtless has its place 
But the pity of such ways among the common people 
a democracy — there are no words that can describe the 
wrong of such condition. And yet every boy and gif 
that our schools send out purposeless, they send out to 
the probability of such a fate as I have described 
Every parent who permits a son or a daughter to lead 
such an aimless life in school work is laying up 
against a day of doom. 
Now I do not think that every boy or girl can sa}
-P-A-G-E-243
SHOOTING TO HIT 238 
for sure, what he or she should do for a living when 
they are grown up. Nor do I think that parents can 
settle this for them, with positive accuracy, every time; 
nor that teachers can determine the matter without. mis- 
take. But I do believe that, in the cases of nearly all 
children, somewhere between the ages of fourteen and 
eighteen, these three parties together, the pupil, the 
parent, and the teacher—that this combination can 
settle, with reasonable definiteness, what work in life 
each pupil is best suited to perform. In many cases 
(I could almost say in most) this could be determined 
much earlier in the life of the child. Personally, I know 
sores of children who are not yet in their teens, who 
show such unmistakable signs of their bent of mind, 
their likes and dislikes, their longages and shortages, 
that it would be perfectly safe to predict what work in 
life they will best succeed in. And my experience is 
Yours, I am sure. 
And then, having chosen the line of life work for a . 
thild, there can no longer be any doubt that the wise 
thing to do is to train him or her along that particular 
line, to the best advantage possible. 
And again I say, there is no need of fear that by © 
doing this we shall make one-sided men and women. 
Or, if it be admitted that there is such a danger, is it 
Rot true that a one-sided man or woman is far preferable 
toone who has so many sides that none of them are of 
aay account in making a living? 
The fact is, the day of the all-round man has forever 
Passed. In the days of my father, no further back than 
that, it was possible for one mind to compass a very large 
Part of the full sum of knowledge that was then avail- 
ale. But no one can do that now ; and the man who
-P-A-G-E-244
236 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
tries to do it, or the school that tries to have him do it 
will end in failure. 
When I was a boy I went out hunting prairie 
chickens. There were thousands of them in the fields 
in those days. I was with an old hunter, and the first 
covey of birds that we flushed, I up with my gun, shut 
my eyes, and blazed away at the flock. And I never 
touched a feather! After I had done that a few times, 
the old man said to me, “That’s no way to shoot 
chickens, my boy! When the flock rises, I don’t care if 
there’s a million of ’em, just pick out one bird out of the 
lot, and bring your gun up till you can see that bird 
right over the top of your gun-barrel, and then shoot, 
and that bird is your meat!” 
And it was so. 
Some day we shall train our boys and girls in ou 
public schools, and in our colleges and universities, t 
shoot to hit, leading them to see that even one bird at 3 
time isa great deal better than simply a loud report 
with nothing but noise to show for it, while some oné 
else pays the bills! 
But we are more to be pitied than blamed for our 
_ wrong-goings in this matter. We have been so long 
drilled to think that such is the only and best way; and 
it has for so long been counted as so “respectable” 
As recent an authority as James Russell Lowell has 
said that “a university is a place where nothing usefel 
should be taught.” Lowell was a great man, in many 
ways, but he was “short” in his ideas as to the true 
purpose of educative work, for the people of a demo 
racy who have to earn a living and hoe their owt 
rows.

Tar doing of such work as has been outlined in the 
Previous chapter will necessitate the closest personal 
telations between pupils and teachers, during the whole 
of the child’s school life. This is at variance with the 
Ways of college and university life, especially in the 
er institutions of this sort. In the smaller colleges 
things are better in this respect, and that is one item 
favor of a small college. But in our public schools 
the Principle of the personal interest of the teachers in 
all their pupils should extend to the farthest boundary. 
y such teachers should be permitted in these 
schools as love the work, and also Jove the pupils they 
York for and with. It may be a long time till then, but 
our schools are young yet, and they are arriving. 
In that sterling book of his, “The New Education," 
237
-P-A-G-E-246
238 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
Professor A. M. Palmer, of Harvard, has told how 
things ought to be in this respect, and some day the 
ways he has outlined will be realized. 
To reach such an attainment, one of the first removes 
that must be made from current ways will be getting 
rid of the idea that our public schools are charitable 
institutions, and so that it is a part of their business to 
make places for teachers who “need the money.” 
That these schools are such institutions is a deep-seated 
belief which is very largely held by the rank and file 
of our people at present, and hence it will be very slow 
in its abatement. None the less, it must pass with 
other inherited things that are no longer of use. 
That this idea is so prevalent is no wonder, for the 
public schools grew out of an order of things in which 
charity was the chief factor. But that condition no 
longer obtains. The simple truth is that, since the 
schools have become “common,” since they are now 4 
part of the state’s way of doing the best it can to insure 
a constituency of good citizens; since this is now the 
mission and status of the schools, they have become the 
most practical kind of a business proposition. Their 
business is to make good citizens, first-class members of 
the body politic, which is only another phrase for good 
men and women. And the making of good men and 
women out of children does not necessitate, as a factor, 
the taking care of a lot of men and women by paying 
them to do work which they are wholly unfit for, by 
employing as teachers those whose chief claim for the 
place is their poverty! 
It may be necessary for the state to care for such 
poverty-stricken people, to feed and clothe them; but 
it has no right to try to shirk such provision for watt

or misfortune by foisting these incompetents upon the 
public schools in the guise of teachers, and.so, not only 
forcing people to support them in that way, but com- 
pélling the children to suffer from their inability. I 
would not be harsh in saying this, yet it is a word that 
needs to be said, and to be said out loud — very loud. 
Because it may seem to some of my readers that I 
have overestimated the way people feel about our 
schools in the matter and the belief they have that they 
should be used for the benefit of those who “need the 
money,” I insert just here a letter that I took from a 
local newspaper of a moderate-sized city, a few days 
ago, as follows : — 
“I think it is about time the old teachers stepped out 
and gave the young graduates that are turned out of our 
high school every year a chance. I think it would be 
4 good plan to change teachers, as well as school in- 
pectors, more often. Let them know there are other 
ies that can teach those rooms, and some need the 
Money and position worse than the present teachers in 
‘ome cases I am sure.” 
And say not in your hearts that the writer of this 
letter is a sinner above all others, J tell you nay, but 
the case is common, more’s the pity. But it must pass 
With the rest of our bad inheritances, and it will do so 
Mdue time. Meanwhile, let’s help it to go. 
Another change that presents exceeding difficulties is 
the training of teachers so that they shall be well fitted 
to dothe new work that is required to be done in our 
public schools. This is especially the case in the man- 
al training and domestic economy lines of school work. 
Hete, the ways are all so new that trouble crops out 
and creeps in, in all attempts to do what is so needful
-P-A-G-E-248
240 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
to be done. What are the best things to be done in 
these two lines of school work, and how shall the work 
proposed be accomplished? These and other equally 
important questions crowd to the front wherever such 
work has been attempted. 
It is only a short time since a superintendent of one 
of our leading cities said to me: “I fear that our whole 
effort in manual training and domestic economy will fail, 
because I cannot get teachers who can do what it seems 
to me ought to be done.” He went on to say further: 
“I confess I don’t know myself what ought to be done, 
either in courses of study or in carrying them out if once 
they are determined upon. I have never had any er 
perience in such lines of work, and so I know next to 
nothing about it. In our shop, I first got a man fora 
teacher who had had training in the theory of such 
work. He was a good man, viewed from that stand- 
point; but when he came to actually handling tools, 10 
really doing the things he talked about, and tried to 
teach, here he fell down, miserably! Then I got a prac 
tical mechanic, and put him in charge. He could we 
tools, but he knew nothing of teaching, and the boys ra 
over him, and so his work was a failure.” 
It was an honest confession, and it stated the situation 
as it is to-day, to a great extent, all over the country, 9 
far as this kind of work in our schools is concerned 
Nor will the situation get very much better right away. 
It is a long road we shall have to travel in this respect 
but we shall cover the ground as the years go by. 
Some of our state universities and polytechnic 
schools are beginning to give special attention to the 
development of directive courses of study and practice 
in these fields, and to the training of men and women
-P-A-G-E-249
jUST A LITTLE ABOUT TEACHERS 241 
teach the work which they outline. But better than this, 
in a good many ways, our public schools will gradually 
work these problems out for themselves. Always, when 
the need comes, men and women appear who are equal 
to the doing of the task required. Gradually, teachers 
will arise who will point out the ways that can be trav- 
éled successfully. No one teacher will do all this, but 
here one, and there another, will discover and work out 
the things that ought to be done, to a degree, and then 
will reveal to others what they have found out, and so 
the work will proceed. Just here comes in the most 
excellent directive work that some manual training and 
domestic economy magazines are now giving to teachers 
and the public. 
But, more than ail this, there is destined to be a great 
advance, in the not distant future, in the way we train 
our teachers to teach. The calling will become more 
and more a profession, which no one will be permitted to 
tater who has not received adequate training, and who 
has not had the experience that is essential to the suc- 
cessful doing of the work required. This principle 
obtains in almost every other trade or profession that 
can be named. The reason it is not insisted upon in the 
Matter of teaching is that, as yet, the pedagogical side of 
the situation is but very poorly understood and compre- 
hended by the people as they go — by the patrons of the 
ool, Here is the crux of the whole situation, the 
on of understanding on the part of the public in gen- 
ing as : of parents in particular, as to what real teach- 
acomste People get killed on railroads through the 
ce of engineers, we insist that the men who 
andle locomotives shall have special training and

experience before they are given charge of an engine on 
the road. And this must be genuine training and actual 
experience, too. It must be something more than going 
through the motions of engineering, of studying the 
theory of air brakes and time-tables. A man must serve 
a seven years’ apprenticeship in doing the subordinate 
work that leads up to the place of engineer, before he is 
given entire control of an engine doing actual work ona 
road. 
Let me push this comparison a little farther. There 
are most excellent schools in this country for the train- 
ing of locomotive engineers. These schools have 4 
most comprehensive curriculum, which includes four 
years of work in shops and on engines, and which is 
just as near the real thing as it is possible to attain to 
without the real thing itself. Such schools have loco 
motives so mounted that they can go through all the 
motions of engines in actual use on the road. These 
locomotives can be made to run at any speed that Is 
possible for any ordinary engine. They can be 9 
manipulated that they will put forth the energy required 
to draw any kind of a train or any number of cars, such 
as they would ever be called on to handle in the regular 
work on the road. They are regularly equipped with 
air brakes, both for themselves and for the train they 
are supposed to be handling. In a word, each such 
outfit is a perfect suppositional engine and train, and 
its handling is designed to include all the exigencies 
that would arise in actual railroading. 
The students have four years of training in the work 
of building engines, taking them apart and putting them 
together, repairing them, and running them under all 
sorts of supposed conditions. They learn all about aif
-P-A-G-E-251
ee 
JUST A LITTLE ABOUT TEACHERS 243 
brakes, and all the paraphernalia of cars, both freight 
and passenger. They study. all the theories regarding 
these things, and have the advantage of the best litera- 
ture and the ablest teachers that the world affords on all 
these lines. Four years of this work they have, and it 
is good, honest, substantial, and solid work, too. 
Now, would it not seem that young men, so trained, 
would be well fitted to go right to work and successfully 
handle a locomotive on a railroad? Theoretically, it 
appears so, surely. And yet, note the facts in the case. 
Not one of the graduates from such a school, not from 
the best of them (and there are several most excellent 
schools of this kind in the country), not one graduate 
from the best of them all, not even the leader in his 
class, could get a position, even as engineer on a switch 
engine, on any standard railroad in the United States, 
or elsewhere, on the strength of his credentials and his 
diploma alone, or because of the work he had done in 
Such schools. To the uninitiated, that may seem strange 
and perhaps hard; but it is a fact that inquiry will read- 
ily verify, 
Now why is all this? Simply because the managers 
of railroads are practical, hard-headed business men, 
whom experience has taught that it is not safe to put 
men who are only ¢heoretically trained into actual work. 
These merely school-bred men all lack the one thing 
needful, namely, actual experience with the real thing; 
and this can only be obtained by contact with the real 
thing. That is the situation. 
How, then, do these graduates from locomotive en- 
Sineering ever get into the places they have been edu- 
cated to fill? Are such schools a failure, and does the 
long, hard work done in them count for nothing? Here
-P-A-G-E-252
244 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
is the rest of the story: When these graduates leave 
school and seek places on the road, they are set to work 
at the foot of the ladder, and from there they are obliged 
to work their way up. They are given trial jobs of the 
simplest sorts, and thus they are tested to prove what 
manner of men they are. In a word, they are examined 
by actual tests, not by mere memory grinds, and are 
‘proved by what they can do, and not by what they can 
write on paper. 
Such graduates are put to work wiping the dirt and 
oil from engines in the roundhouse, to start on! If they 
do this work well, and prove themselves masters of it, 
they are promoted to more difficult tasks, and so they 
mount the ladder of their chosen calling. As a rule, it 
takes about three years for such a graduate to get a0 
engine that he can have entire charge of, in actual 
service on the road. For the man who starts out to get 
such a place without this special school-training in 4 
school for locomotive engineering, it takes seven yeals 
to secure such a position. And so the men are com 
paratively even at the end of the first seven years 
After that, I am told, the odds are largely in favor of 
the school-trained man; though that is neither here not 
there, so far as this discussion is concerned. I only 
mention it to show that this sort of schoo! work does 
pay, and that it is for the best in the long run. 
But the point I want to make is this: That, whereas 
after a man has had these four long years of very neatly 
practical work in training to be an engineer, and eves 
then is not permitted to take charge of an engine until 
he has had three years more of actual experience on the 
road — whereas all this is so, yet, in school work, we 
will take a graduate from almost anywhere between
-P-A-G-E-253
JUST A LITTLE ABOUT TEACHERS 245 
grammar school and a university course, and put him in 
full charge of a roomful of boys and girls, and expect 
him to do successful work as a teacher, even if he has 
never actually taught a single day! Was ever anything 
more preposterously foolish or irrational, not to say 
positively insane ? 
Because, as a matter of fact, successfully running an 
engine is a simple attainment when compared with 
successfully teaching a school. This is not generally 
reckoned to be the case, but it is so, all the same. And 
the reason for this misunderstanding, on the part of the 
public in general, and of parents in particular, lies in 
the fact that teaching blunders are not as palpable as 
engineering mistakes and errors are. If an engineer 
'sincompetent and fails to do his duty, tangible property 
's destroyed or lives are lost, and these are things that 
tverybody can see and know about, and that everybody 
knows the value of. But if.a teacher blunders, and as 
a tesult boys and girls drop out of school and so fail to 
get what they ought to have, for lack of which they will 
suffer all their lives — when this happens, it is a personal 
or private affair ; very few know anything about it, and 
sill fewer care anything about it, anyway, and so the 
matter passes unnoticed year after year. 
But, oh, the truth about these blunders of teachers 
who so wreck the children’s lives, and who (more’s the 
Bity) have no idea of what ruin they are causing or 
Permitting! This part of the story is simply untellable. 
¢t, even here, no one is really to blame. We haven't, 
any of us, meant to be so bad, to really do wrong. But 
We have been bad, and we are doing wrong every time 
We permit a teacher to take a place in our schoolrooms 
merely on academic credentials. The ordinary test of
-P-A-G-E-254
246 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
teaching ability that is now made by mere written 
examinations of the candidates is practically of little or 
no value whatever in determining the real worth of 
the individual in actual schoolroom work. This is just 
as true of state examination tests as it is of county 
superintendents’ tests, or of city superintendents’ tests. 
The written work done by such candidates no more 
proves their ability to teach than merely written tests 
of an engineer would prove his ability to successfully 
handle an engine, in actual work on the road. Nay, it 
does not nearly as much demonstrate the thing which 
it is set to prove, in the first case, as it would in the 
last, because, successful teaching is as much more 
subtle and difficult a task than engineering, as the 
mind of a child is more complicated and difficult of 
handling than is a mass of iron and steel. 
And yet, as things are now, a diploma of almost any 
kind, surely one granted by a college or a normal schodl, 
is almost a sesame open to a position as teacher in our 
public schools. Such a document is, by itself, no positive 
evidence whatever of ability to teach children successfully. 
The knowledge that the diploma vouches for may be 
essential to successful schoolroom work, but the mere 
possession of this knowledge is no proof of ability toteach. 
Indeed, the poorest work I have ever seen done in our 
public schools has been at the hands of college graduates 
who were teaching in grammar grades, and who had 20 
experience in teaching. I have seen work done by such 
as these that would break your heart! 
There are thousands of schoolrooms in this countty 
the work of which will prove the truth of the statement 
just made. The men and women in charge of very many 
of these schoolrooms are book educated and memory
-P-A-G-E-255
JUST A LITTLE ABOUT TEACHERS 247 
trained sufficiently for their places; but they know very 
little or nothing about teaching. The thing they chiefly 
know how to do is to assign pages to be memorized, and 
to stand pupils up and see if they can repeat what they 
have been asked to learn! Besides this, they must be 
able to “keep order” and “not allow whispering,” and 
tosee to it that the pupils march out and in well. In 
how many of our public schools is this and the like of 
this called good teaching? You answer. ° 
Bearing upon which, I have recently seen the practical 
work of an attempt that is now making, in some states, 
ofhaving a State Board of Examination pass upon the 
qualifications of all the teachers of that state. These 
ttaminers issue questions for the examinations, and send 
them to the county superintendents, who submit them 
‘o the candidates for teaching. The candidates write 
aswers to the questions submitted, and their papers are 
sent to the State Board, to “mark” and pass upon. No 
Tames are attached to the papers (they are only num- 
bered to identify them) and the examiners do not even 
tow, when passing upon a given paper, whether it was 
Witten by aman or woman! And from such absolutely 
dchumanized, impersonal data the examiners are supposed 
to be able to determine whether or not the candidates 
they pass upon are fitted to teach! What railroad would 
"main solvent for one year if it examined its engineers 
"this way? What does your common sense tell you 
about it ? 
Yet I would not too much blame this attempt at doing 
the tight thing. For such an attemptitis. There were 
ils under the systern which it was set to better; but 
they must have been very bad if this way will mend 
The primary factor in good teaching is the
-P-A-G-E-256
248 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
_D personality of the teacher, and this is left at the zen 
point by such a method of judging of pedagogic qualif- 
cations. This system of state examinations, as I sawit 
exploited, was well and faithfully done by good men and 
women, but I cannot believe that any great good will 
ever come of it. 
The way to learn how to teach is to teach, as the way 
to learn how to run an engine is to run an engine. But 
neither can be done successfully out of hand, or without 
long practice under competent instruction. I would not 
want to. say that no person should ever be permitted to 
teach who had not been especially trained for the pro 
fession, any more than I would want to say that no per 
son should ever be permitted to run an engine until he 
had had seven years of preliminary work. There a 
geniuses in all callings. I know good teachers who 
have had but very little training outside of their owt 
experience. . I know first-class engineers who have come 
to their own in the same way. But these are all excep 
tions. They are not the kind to go by, for the rank and 
file of us. Asa rule, it takes years of special training 
under first-class direction and instruction to make 4 ' 
teacher, just as it takes similar experience and meth 
to make a good engineer. . 
Our normal schools and our pedagogical classes ® 
colleges and universities have already done a great d 
in the way of training teachers to teach; but if the? 
truth be told, even these have as yet done but partially 
what needs to be done much more thoroughly. The 
reason for making this statement is the fact that i e 
of their work is the real thing. Those who do it ate 
doing suppositional work. Their work corres 
almost exactly with the training given to engineers 4
-P-A-G-E-257
JUST A LITTLE ABOUT TEACHERS 249 
their training schools. And such graduates all need to 
serve a practical apprenticeship in actual schoolroom 
work done under competent supervision, before they 
ae given full control of a roomful of children, or, 
especially, before they are put in command of a corps 
of teachers ! 
And yet, how common a thing it is for a man or 
woman who has never taught a day, to be given even 
the position of principal or superintendent of schools, 
solely because he or she has graduated from some scho- 
lastic institution! A similar system pursued in railroad- 
ing would very shortly ruin any road that tried the 
experiment. That it has served our schools no worse is 
4 proof of how much abuse a well-grounded institution 
can stand and not go to the wall. 
Some day we shall insist on practical experience in 
teaching on the part of every applicant for an independ- 
ent position in our schools; and, further, we shall 
examine all candidates for such positions, not merely on 
their scholastic attainments, and that in an impersonal 
Way, but by personal inspection, by competent judges, of 
the actual schoolroom work that the applicants can do. 
That will be an examination which worthy teachers will 
lever think of shrinking. from, but which, on the con- 
trary, they will be proud to undergo —as proud as a 
Competent engineer always is to demonstrate to the 
Superintendent how skillfully he can handle an engine. 
Tn those days, candidates for teacher’s certificate, either 
County or state, will not wear their lives away memorizing 
Cyclopedias, and in other ways making themselves ready 
to answer, on the instant, any one of a thousand and 
one questions that really have no relation whatever to 
teaching school.
-P-A-G-E-258
250 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
I would not be pessimistic or faultfinding for is 
own sake; and every honest observer of our schools 
knows, from the observations I have made, that I an 
neither. As I have already intimated, the whole situ 
tion is far more our misfortune than our fault, and now 
that we are coming to understand the real conditions in 
the premises, we are setting about making them whit 
they should be. 
Of course, a successful settling of this difficulty means 
ever so many more things than I can discuss here 
It takes in all the issues of permanency in the pro 
fession, salaries, tenure of place, and scores of other 
things, none of which can be settled in a day, of ™ 
many days. But the fact that we are coming to colt 
prehend the truth that teaching is a profession as 
engineering is a calling; that the mere possession of a 
memory-knowledge of what is in books is no criterion 
for successful training of boys and girls in a schoo 
toom; that our schools are not for the support of 
teachers whose chief claim for place is the fact that 
they are without visible means of support; that 10 
place in a schoolroom is to be used for payment of ay 
political, or social, or denominational debt, — the fact 
that at least some people are coming to see thes? 
things as they are is a hopeful sign, and all the results 
towards which this sign points will come in due time. 
Meantime, let us all do what we can to secure # 
good results as we can, while we wait.

TazrE are two chief items in the count in consider- 
ing parents as they stand related to an educational 
Problem that includes all the children of all the people. 
The first is the difficulty in getting parents to realize, or 
at least acknowledge, the way their children are; and 
the second is the still greater task of inducing them to 
do what ought to be done under the circumstances. 
For instance, in the first place it is a matter of com- 
Mon knowledge that almost all fathers and mothers 
ve preconceived ideas as to what they wish their 
children to be when they are grown up. . This is often 
tot a general and indefinite affair, but is frequently very 
specific and direct. Not infrequently these ideas take 
Positive shape before their child is born, and there is a 
Very prevalent notion that such prenatal desires and 
Purposes, on the part of parents, have a highly potent 
Influence on determining the character and bent of mind 
their children. There are mothers, in untellable 
251
-P-A-G-E-260
252 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
numbers, who have dedicated their sons to the ministry 
months before they knew whether their prospective 
offspring was to be a boy or girl. This is only one of 
thousands of similar instances, though probably the most 
numerous of all the train, for reasons that I cannot go 
into here. Kings and queens plan for and speculate 
upon the character and career of a prospective heir to 
the throne who shall come from their loins, and beggars 
are anxious that their progeny shall be more expert at 
winning pennies from the susceptible than they them 
selves have been. 
And so multitudes of children that come into this 
world are handicapped, from the day of their birth, by 
cut-and-dried plans for their future development. Par- 
ents have notions as to what they wish their children to 
do, or to become, and in pursuance of these notions 
they gauge their actions and force their children into 
ways that tally with what they wish the outcome to be. 
In doing this they seldom have any regard for the 
way their children are, for their natural aptitude af 
mind, and for the possibilities that are within thei 
reach. With their hopes and their baseless faith rooted 
in the popular educational ideas that I have noted in 
previous chapters, namely, that any child can be or do 
anything that its parents wish it to be or to do (for that 
is practically the way they hold the matter in mind— 
their translation of such educational dogma), they pte 
ceed to try to fashion the child according to their pre 
determined plans. Sometimes this brings results that 
are in accordance with the purpose that underlies it 
Occasionally a startling tally is made in this way. But, 
for the most part, those who travel this road have a time 
of it.
-P-A-G-E-261
THE PARENTAL FACTOR 253 
And this leads me naturally to the matter of heredity, 
concerning which I have space for only a word. The 
honest truth is, we know next to nothing about the 
transmission of traits from parents to offspring in the 
human family. We know that it is common for children 
toresemble their fathers and mothers in physical ap- 
pearance, to a greater or less extent. There are usually 
“family features” that are not hard to detect. It is also 
true that there are some mental characteristics that 
are occasionally to be noted in given families, sometimes 
for several successive generations. But when this has 
been said, the reliable testimony in the case is all in. 
All beyond that is mere guesswork, and cannot be 
Counted on in the least. Such are the facts. 
I know all about the theories in the premises; but 
you and I know, all parents know, that, so far as our 
own experience goes, these theories are not based on 
facts, It is the universal experience that counts; and 
that all goes to show that, as yet, we know very little 
about breeding as it pertains to the human family. 
We have it down to quite definite lines among the ani- 
mals below us, and in the vegetable kingdom the results 
qisinable are brought within the limits of the positively 
tothe f Mr. Darwin has shown the way as it pertains 
first, and Mr. Burbank has revealed the wonders 
tonne what can be done in the second. But when 
more ‘ us and ours, neither of these authorities can 
mar ne speculate. You and I can do that.

-P-A-G-E-262
254 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
are false, rather than in harmony with what their com 
mon sense shows them is true. They will persist in 
trying to fashion the lives and characters of their 
offspring along the lines of their own preconceived 
notions (which are based on what their children ought 
to be, according to the theories of a groundless heredi- 
tary philosophy), to the utter neglect of what they know, 
in their inmost souls, their children ought to do. Let 
me note a concrete case which will clearly illustrate the 
point. 
I know a man who is a fine musician. He can sing 
anything he can see, he can play any musical instr 
ment he can get his hands on. Now it would be sup 
posed, according to the theoretical laws of heredity, 
that this man’s progeny would be musically strong. 
He has one daughter, and she can hardly tell one tone 
from another. And there you are. I'll note more of 
this case farther on, but this much of it is all I care for 
just here, 
Nor is this nearly so rare a case as some, especially 
heredity theorists, would have us think. All parents 
know that the same thing is true with their own chil 
dren, to a greater or less degree. It is by no means 
music, in all cases; but, somewhere, on some lines, the 
children will be found to vary largely from their pro 
genitors; and it is a rare thing for pronounced qualities 
to be transmitted from parent to child. And yet it s 
‘almost a rule that parents are ambitious to have theif 
children excel along lines on which they are themselves 
particularly strong. 
How these things can be, why these variations be 
tween parents and children, is a great question for 
which no wholly satisfactory answer has yet been found
-P-A-G-E-263
THE PARENTAL FACTOR 255 
There are many guesses, but the best of them satisfy at 
only a few points. The Theosophists come as near as 
any I know anything about in answering the riddle, but 
even these can only surmise, and hint at possibilities. 
They tell how it may be, and some of the things they 
say are exceedingly suggestive. But what they know 
for sure is like all the rest, — nil! 
So the first point to be gained in the new order of 
things is for parents to be willing to see their children as 
they really are, to fairly measure their natural aptitudes 
and possibilities, regardless of theories as to what they 
should have been if heredity were what it is claimed to 
be, and then to plan for the future of their offspring 
accordingly. And yet these are the things that it is 
almost impossible to get done. 
To revert to the case that I partly told of a few para- 
graphs back. This father thought that because he was 
musical his daughter should be. And when he found 
that she was not, that fact made no difference in the 
Plans he laid for her education, nor for the means he 
undertook to carry out those plans. According to the 
educational theories he had been reared in (the common 
theories of his time, and largely of “this present now ”", 
he could make a fine musician out of his child, anyhow. 
She was an exceedingly bright child, and her mental 
Capabilities seemed to her father to be sufficient to make 
a success of anything she might undertake. She could 
tead at three years of age, and showed mental abilities 
far beyond the average child from her earliest infancy. 
With this equipment, the father felt sure he could realize 
his heart’s desire regarding his daughter, and he pro- 
ceeded to work out his plans accordingly. 
He bought the best piano that could be had, and he
-P-A-G-E-264
256 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
procured the best teacher that money could hire. And 
he put the piano, the teacher, and the girl together, and 
kept them together for months and years. And the 
girl tried her best to do what her father wanted her to 
do, to be what he was ambitious she should become —a 
good musician. 
But it was all of no avail. After weary years of prac- 
tice, and the hardest kind of work at the piano, she and 
all gave it up. To be sure, she got so that she could 
make her fingers go over the keyboard as the score on 
the rack said they should go. But that doesn’t make 
music. And in time her father came to realize that it 
did not (though it nearly broke his heart to acknowledge 
the fact), and he gave her a respite from what had 
always been a dreary and senseless task for all parties 
concerned, not to say a bore to most of them. The 
only possible exceptions were the man who sold the 
piano and the teacher who got the money for his 
lessons ! 
The girl is a woman now, and she never touches the 
piano. You couldn’t hire her to do so. She can't 
play; and, thank God, she knows she can’t play! But 
she is not a dull woman, for all that. She can paint 
divinely! All the time that she was struggling with 
the piano that she could do nothing with, she was 
begging to be allowed to use her brush and pencil 
She made pictures in her books, and covered the blank 
spaces on her sheet music with drawings of all sorts of 
things. But for all this she was reprimanded and called 
down. Forsooth, her father was no artist in color, and 
why should his daughter be? He could do nothing ia 
that line, and why should she wish to? Let her be 4 
musician! If she would try hard enough, and long
-P-A-G-E-265
THE PARENTAL FACTOR 257 
enough, she surely could be. He had done these 
things successfully, and with little effort, and he was 
her father; and why should not child do what father 
did so readily — what he so much loved to do? . 
There was just one good reason. She was “born 
short” on music and “born long” on color and form. 
It was not in her to be an artist in tone. It was in her 
to be an artist in color. Color was God’s way for the 
girl; tone was the father’s way. It is God’s way that 
wins, give it time, if we do not kill our children trying 
to make them go as we wish, whether or not! And 
many children are killed by such treatment. 
This case is no rarer in its second stage than its first. 
And others like it are on every hand, whichever way 
We tum. You know them, I know them; they are 
everywhere. There are few families that are exempt 
or immune from some form of the trouble, to a greater 
or less extent. 
And what shall we do about it? 
This: we shall first be willing to acknowledge the - 
facts in the case, to make an honest estimate of the way 
our children are, regardless of notions as to what they 
should have been, theoretically. Then we shall plan 
for each child according to the indications revealed by 
these facts, and be satisfied to work the case out that 
Way, 
Yet this is a very hard thing for parents to do. We 
ate all so anxious to have our children conform to the 
Ways of other children; ot do as society, or fashion, or 
Custom, or tradition suggest or demand. How often 
have we all heard mothers say: “My child is just as 
‘mart as my neighbor’s child, and what one can do the 
other can do!” This trouble crops out so frequently

in the work done in graded schools, and is a measure 
less source of annoyance to teachers of the rank and 
file. All sorts of jealousies between pupils and of 
quarrels among parents arise from this source. Be- 
cause of it teachers are accused of partiality and of 
other high crimes and misdemeanors. In fact it is the 
black beast of nearly all schoolrooms; and the basis of 
the trouble lies, almost altogether, with the parents, who 
insist that their child, or children, shall do just what 
some other child or children have done, or are doing, 
regardless of the natural capabilities and aptitudes of 
their own offspring. 
Parents who read these lines, will you ponder on their 
application to your own case, and to that of your own 
children? 
This comparison of our children with others, and 
wishing ours to do what others do, and as well or better 
than others do, often works injustice to the children. 
In a word, it is because of our desire to fashion our 
children according to the influences from without theit 
lives, rather than from the God-born impulses and 
powers that are within them, that we go wrong and 
make them go wrong. 
I know a boy from a fine family who had an inbom 
desire to be a barber. Strange, perhaps, that this should 
be so, but so itwas. His parents were chagrined beyond 
measure at the fact, and they tried to make a professional 
man of him. But it was a lamentable failure. And he 
is now a successful barber. And why not? He was 
ashamed of himself, and of the work he tried to do as 4 
professional man, and he had full cause to be. He is 
proud of his work at the chair; he has a fine patronage, 
and his customers believe in him. I have no doubt he
-P-A-G-E-267
THE PARENTAL FACTOR. 259 
and his well-done work will tally all right at Judgment 
Day; and is not that the main thing, after all? 
But we don’t want our children to be barbers, and 
blacksmiths, and such like. We want them to “wear a 
gold watch chain, and sit on a high stool,” regardless of” 
whether they have aptitude for that sort of thing or not. 
There is right where the whole trouble lies. In this 
matter we consider the conventional, the proper, Mrs. 
Grundy, the neighbors, our own notions, and nearly 
everything else that ought not to count’for a pin’s fee, 
before we ask the question, what are the natural capa- 
bilities and aptitudes of the child? And, for the most 
part, we prefer to try to make a poor professional, rather 
than a first-class mechanic or laborer bf any kind, out of 
achild of ours. That is history. 
_ Now, as I have said before, I do not pretend that it 
'8 possible, early in life, to tell just exactly what each 
and every child had best do for a living when he is 
gown. But I do insist that in very many cases it is 
Perfectly clear, often quite clear in early life, what he 
should not do, or try to do, and that is something. The 
tusical father I have spoken of should have seen, years 
before he did, that it was folly — not to say cruelty — to 
keep his daughter at work at the piano, I honestly be- 
lieve he knew this all the time. He used to try to seem 
Pleased over his daughter’s playing, but there was no 
teal pleasure for him in her performance. What he 
said and did was only to encourage her, and to buoy up 
his own hopes. If any one but his daughter had played 
4 she did, — at her best, — he would have left the room. 
And yet he kept the girl at it. 
How is it at your house, teacher, parent, or whosoever 
of you is trying to educate —yourself or some one else?
-P-A-G-E-268
260 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
I do not underestimate the value of tackling difficult 
tasks, and of putting in hard, and perhaps disagreeable, 
work in mastering them. All these things have their 
place as educative forces. But what I do protest 
against is forcing children to continue to labor at tasks 
from which they can never produce anything that they 
can be proud of, or even be decently satisfied with. 
That is what crushes the soul. The girl I have spoken 
of was always ashamed of her piano playing. The boy 
who cuts hair is always proud of his work. There can 
be no question as to which is best for the soul. 
And so I would say to parents: study your children, 
_ and in consultation with them and their teachers do your 
best to set their feet in ways that lead to soul-satisfaction 
regarding what they do in life; knowing that it is not 
what they do, but how they do it, that counts, and that 
will count forever; that “there is no trade but that he 
who pursues it may be a hero,” and that a successful 
worker in the humblest of callings can call God to his 
witness, and with pride in his heart can say, “ My Father, 
see what I have done!” But, parent, whoever you are 
if your child is a botch, both you and he will be put to 
shame for ever and ever, so long as the botching is com 
tinued. No forgiveness, no atonement, can ever make 
such a wrong right. And the issue is, will we, as parents 
and teachers, keep on making our children go wrong? 
There is room for each one of all the children of all the 
people to go right, educationally. It is the fault of 
teachers, and especially of parents, if they do not go that 
way.

Taree is a percentage of our children who, as things 
ate, cannot attend our public schools at all, namely, the 
“shorts” who are so wanting on some lines as to unfit 
them for doing any of the work now provided in these 
thools— the blind, deaf and dumb, and the idiotic. 
These are, each according to their own kind, now very 
largely massed together in “institutions” which have 
specially organized for their accommodation. 
hese institutions are in evidence in every state in the 
Union — they are a part of our present plan for educate 
hg all the children of all the people; and, as such, they 
Bust be considered in these pages. 
Now please do not think that I am hostile to these 
§ecial schools for peculiar children, or that I accuse 
the managers and teachers in such institutions of mis- 
fepresentation regarding their work and the possibilities 
% children committed to their care, because of what I 
261
-P-A-G-E-270
262 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
have said in a previous chapter. I have neither the 
purpose nor the desire to do any such thing. Many 
such schools do the very best possible for such children. 
The best of them often give these pupils a chance to 
move out on their “Jong” sides; and, gaining courage 
and strength from such natural exercise of what facul- 
ties they have that they can control and use, such chil 
dren sometimes gain courage and strength in other 
directions; and this results for their well-being and ad- 
vancement, to some degree, on their sadly short sides. 
All of which is well. 
None the less, the fact remains that few children 
who are really powerless in one direction, or in many 
directions —few of these ever make very much prog- 
ress along their congenital short lines, in any school 
special or public. And when the fact of such genuine 
shortage is fully established, it is bad practice to try to 
force the child to normality where he is thus handi- 
capped. To do so is to use him unfairly, his equipmeat 
being taken into the account. It will discourage him, 
make him distrustful of himself among normal childrea, 
and work harm to him in a multitude of ways. Rather 
such children should be so directed that they will move 
out strongly along the lines of what natural abilities 
they may have and so gain a self-confidence, at least in 
some directions, that will lead them not to be afraid, of 
ashamed of themselves when among other children. 
On this count, so reliable an authority as Henry H. 
Goddard, Ph.D., of Vineland, N.J., has recently writtea, 
“It is particularly true of those high-grade cases which 
are not often recognized, save by an expert, and who 
look so much like normal children that it is a tempt 
tion to waste a great deal of time upon them in trying
-P-A-G-E-271
CONCERNING INSTITUTIONS 263 
tomake them develop along normal lines and do those 
things for which they have not the brain or mind. As 
things are now, we generally keep on year after year 
inour endeavor to train these children, and only after 
their school work is passed do we discover that it was 
not possible for them to learn what we were trying to 
teach them. Then we know that, had we taught them 
the things they could do, we might have trained them 
to partial usefulness. But what is readily seen to be 
ine in these extreme cases is equally true in principle of 
all children... .” 
The italics are mine, but the words need to be em- 
phasized, coming from the source that produced them. 
They point out the futility of trying to develop, in any 
all children, faculties and abilities which, on certain” 
lines, do not exist in these particular children. And 
that this author should state that such conditions are 
“equally true in principle of all children” is worthy of . 
special notice and attention. 
So we may say that if a child is born blind he may 
Pethaps be brought to see. If the organs of vision are 
but Partially bad, there is a possibility that they may 
Put right, But if a child is born practically without 
yes, he can never see, and we might as well settle down 
to that conclusion one time as another; and especially, 
lot trouble the child trying to make him see when he 
Nothing to see with. That is the point. 
Of course we do so conclude in such a case of blind- 
tess. But how bad it would be to put blind children 
'tto competition with children with good eyes, and then 
*old them, or punish them, or mark them down, or 
de and disgrace them because they could not.do 
** the good-eyed children do! This is what we should
-P-A-G-E-272
264 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
be careful not to do. And yet something like this is 
done, almost by the wholesale, with children in our 
public schools who are as powerless to do the things 
required of them as an eyeless child is powerless to see! 
Now, because of this fact, multitudes of children who 
are “born short” here or there, and so cannot do some 
of the work required of them in our public schools— 
work which normal children can do easily enough, but 
which all children are compelled to do if they stay in 
their grades — because of these things, many such chil- 
dren are dropped out of these schools altogether. Little 
or no provision is made for their peculiarities, for the 
way they are, and so they find small place in our public 
schoolrooms. They are of all degrees of shortness. 
Sometimes they vary so little from normality that we 
keep them in school for a while, occasionally for @ 
number of years, But for the most part they drop 
back and back in the grades, always on the lines of 
their shortage. Frequently they are more than fairly 
bright in other ways, but this rarely counts. I know it 
does in some schools, but not in many. As a tule, 
they drop back if they cannot “pass examination,” 
and they rarely can pass examination in subjects of 
which they are “born short.” , 
So they drop back and back, till, finally, they get dis 
couraged and drop out of school altogether. We all 
know how it is. The 100,000 children in New York 
City who are behind in their grades, as the school 
reports of that city tell us they are, are examples, each 
to a greater or less extent, of this sort of thing. They 
haven’t dropped out entirely yet; but, for the most patt, 
it is only a matter of time when they will do so, undef 
generally practiced methods. Not one in a hundred,
-P-A-G-E-273
  CONCERNING INSTITUTIONS 265 
I doubt if one in five hundred, of these children will ever 
stay in these schools long enough to graduate, under the 
present régime. 
Since I wrote the above paragraph, I have spent some 
days in visiting the schools of New York City, and I 
am glad to say that I found, in several of them, “Odds 
and Ends” rooms, as it were, where these “born short” 
children, of various sorts and conditions, receive the 
special instruction their individual needs demand. In 
some of these rooms I saw some of the best pedagogi- 
al work it has been my fortune to witness. It is well. 
Let the good work goon. And it is going on; for, in 
fome of the best public schools, all over the country, 
this plan of having special instruction for “ short” pupils 
has been already inaugurated. 
The city of St. Louis has recently begun to make 
special provision for its “short” children by establishing 
Pecial schools for them in different parts of the city. 
ese schools are under the immediate supervision of 
Superintendent George Platt Knox, who has specially 
lected a corps of teachers for this work. There is no 
attempt made in these schools to bunch together, so to 
speak, numbers of children who have similar “shortages,” 
but the aim has been to locate the schools so that they 
Will reach the largest number of children in a given 
district who are so “short,” in any way, that they can- 
Tot keep their places in the grades. I cannot give: 
details of the work done, as I should like to do, for lack 
of space, but I commend the plan St. Louis is working 
Sut as one of the best I have ever seen in operation. 
There are other cities where similar work is being done, 
and I wish them all God speed. . 
(I should like to add, just here, that it seems to me
-P-A-G-E-274
266 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
the efforts now making to do the best possible for these 
“short” children are not as well directed as they will 
some day be. As things now are, the special work ex. 
pended upon these children is intended to put them into 
such a condition that they can take up the regular work 
in the grades, which they have been unable to “carry.” 
That is, an attempt is made to make their “shortages” 
come up to a fixed standard, and then to have them go 
on with their work just'as though they were normal 
pupils. My impression is that time will show that such 
a method is a mistake. It is not in harmony with the 
ultimate facts in these cases, as has been so well stated 
by Professor Goddard in the paragraph I quoted from 
him a few lines back. The truth is that, where pupils 
are so “short” on certain lines that they have to have 
“special treatment,” it is practically useless to try to 
bring them to normality on these lines. By far the 
better thing to do, as Professor Goddard wisely sug- 
gests, is to help such pupils move out strongly where 
they can, and in this way it is not impossible that 
they may, by the impulse thus given, improve on their 
“short” or weak places. The principle to be kept in 
mind is to do the best we can for these pupils on the 
plane of their inabilities, and to let that part of the 
work go at that. Meantime, we will keep on the look- 
out for any signs of improvement on these weak places, 
and if there are evidences of better conditions, make 
the most of them. 
These cases can often be handled successfully by 
having such pupils recite in two or more grades in 
school. Thus, if a pupil is “short” in mathematics, 
such pupil may recite in a lower grade, where simpler 
work is done in this branch, and go on with his class in
-P-A-G-E-275

work which he is able to carry. Such accommodations 
tf pupils in different grades can readily be arranged for, 
if only there is a will to do it on the part of the teachers 
and the principal. And it is a most excellent way to 
This mixing of grades will not destroy anything of 
ral value in the schools, The military uniformity is 
all that will have to suffer. It will make some extra 
work, to be sure, but the results will pay for all that. 
itis only another way of fitting the schools to the needs 
ofthe children, instead of forcing the children to fit the 
whools, or to drop out if they cannot conform.) 
But, whatever efforts are now making or are to be 
made to help out large numbers of children who. are 
Partially “short,” as it were, there still remain many 
thildren who are very short —the blind, the deaf and 
dumb, and the idiotic _—and for these we make so little 
Provision in our public schools that they, as a rule, are 
outfrom the start. Few of the blind and of the deaf 
ad dumb ever enter these schools at all. Many who 
He idiotic, to a greater or less degree, start in at these 
tchools, go for a little while, and then are dropped out. 
And these latter, the blind, the deaf and dumb, and 
the idiotic, who are short in so many ways that the 
Course of study in the graded schools in no way meets 
their needs these are gathered together, in large num- 
bets, because there is no place for them in the public 
thools, and sent to special institutions, there to be cared 
fot and educated where their shortages can be taken 
Mo account. This is the common practice in this 
Country at present. It is backed by the best and most 
humane of motives. Private generosity and state assist- 
ince have vied with each other to make provision for
-P-A-G-E-276
268 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
these unfortunates, and institutions devoted to such work 
are to be found on every hand. 
And yet — 
Have you ever visited any of these institutions? If 
you have not done so, I wish you would, the first 
chance you get, especially if you are a teacher. For! 
assure you, you would find much therein to make 
you think many things. At least, I assure you that I 
thought many things when one of the best superintend- 
ents of a state institution for the blind in this country 
said to me, with tears in his eyes: “After an experience 
of eight years as the head of this institution, I say to 
you, frankly, that I really fear we do these children 
more harm than good!” Is not a remark like that, 
made by a man of the rarest ability in his profession, 
and who has had eight years’ experience in his work, 
and who has had charge of thousands of blind children 
during that time —is not that something to think about, 
in this matter of the education of all the children of all 
the people? 
And then he went on to explain the reason for his 
doubts. He said that, while they did a great deal for 
these children, in many ways, in the institution he had 
charge of, yet the fact that they had so many of them 
together, and that, for so many years (the formative 
years of each child’s life) they were forced to keep the 
children in such unnatural surroundings on the social 
and domestic sides of life —that, for these reasons, the 
total result was of very doubtful quality. 
“What we have here,” he said, “is virtually a great 
big hotel. And the life these children lead is, practr 
cally, a hotel life. We care for them in every possible 
way.” (The institution was a model of cleanliness 40
-P-A-G-E-277
CONCERNING INSTITUTIONS. 269 
the most scrupulous care, from top to bottom, within 
and without.) “But,” he went on, “that is not what 
such children need. What they require is to be taught 
to care for themselves, and so become able to support 
themselves. And that we have small means for teach- 
ing them, in an institution like this. We.do what we 
can to teach them to work, but the range we can offer 
them in that direction is very limited. The result is 
that, for the most part, the children sit around and 
vsitand play with one another, and have just as good a 
time as we can give them while they are here. We 
lave them go to school, and do the regular school work: 
% far as possible. But, outside of that, we do not do 
very much for them. The result is that when they leave 
this institution and go home they are so lonesome that 
Many of them pine away and die in a very short time!” 
That is what he said! : 
And his idea was, further, that the proper place for 
these children to grow up is in the homes where they 
Wee born, and among people and surroundings that 
they will have to live with when they are grown; that 
they should be educated with other children, in our pub- 
le schools, so that their childhood friends and acquaint- 
ices should become the friends and acquaintances of 
their mature years, and that the environments of their 
Youth should be those of their manhood and their 
Yomanhood, That may seem to be only a dream, but 
are schools in this country that are making the 
true as I write. 
Ido not know how many such schools there are. I 
‘know, though, that in the days of the late Paul 
ner, of blessed memory, I saw deaf-and-dumb boys 
Sils doing regular work in the Milwaukee, Wiscon-
-P-A-G-E-278
270 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
sin, high schools. These children had been educated 
in public graded schools in that city, where special at 
tention was given to them because of their infirmities. 
In that city, children of like affliction were classed to 
gether in separate rooms and there taught by special 
teachers in their grade work. They had been taught 
to “read the lips” and by the time they were of the 
proper age to enter the high school they were ready to 
go into regular high schools of the city, and do work 
there such as other children were doing. 
In the city of Eau Claire, in the same state, I saw 
“mute” children in a ward school, with the rank and file 
of the children of that municipality, and all doing well. 
In the high schools mentioned in Milwaukee, the 
pupils were in the regular classes, where some special, 
yet really minor, privileges were allowed them because 
of their shortage, But they could all “talk, and sead 
lips,” thanks to Mr. Binner’s faithful teaching, and they 
seemed to be doing well. . 
In Eau Claire, these peculiar “ shorts,” which were M 
a ward school, sat in a room by themselves and had 
special teachers; but they played with the rest of the 
children at noons and recesses, went to and from school 
with them, and they lived in their own homes, with their 
own people. One of their teachers told me that she 
took special pains to have the parents of these pupilsdo 
what ought to be done for them in their homes —to 
train them to do as much as possible for themselves, 
things being as they were. In this way these children 
seemed to be growing up in a way that promised far 
better results than would be likely to come from the er 
periences and habits acquired from years spent in hotel 
life in an institution.

CONCERNING INSTITUTIONS 271 
As this book goes to press, I learn that New York 
City and St. Paul, Minn., have begun to provide for 
their specially “short” children in their public schools. 
lam sure there are other cities which are doing this 
same sort of work. I hope there may be many of them. 
My reason for mentioning the cities I have referred to 
is because I happen to know about them, and of the 
excellent work they are doing. It is surely work in the 
right direction, and it will grow and increase as we 
come to modify our public schools and adapt them to 
the needs of all the children of all the people. 
And that is what we shall do, “some day, some time.” 
Of course, it will cost something to do this way, but we 
need not worry about that. For when have the Ameri- 
tan people ever shrunk from the establishment of edu- 
tational ways and means, when they believed them to be 
for the common good ? 
But, of course, for many years yet we shall keep most 
of these children in institutions, as we are now doing. 
That method is now to the fore, and must have its way 
fora time. But that it will also have its day admits 
of small doubt. Its ways are not without virtues, but 
there are faults that must be corrected ; and when these 
are plucked out, the probabilities are that the institutions 
will pass with them. It will not be an immediate at- 
tainment, but it will come, as we learn how to care for 
these “little ones” in the best way. 
Meantime, let it be said that the management of these - 
institutions for those who are “born short,” or who are 
Warped from normality by disease or misfortune —the 
“asylums” for the blind, the deaf and dumb, the idi- 
otic, the insane, and the criminal——that all these insti- 
tutions which are managed by the state must one day be

‘ placed beyond political control! The necessity for this 
is pronouncedly apparent to all who are in any way 
familiar with the facts, as they exist in a large number 
of cases. Some states there are that have already ar- 
rived at this condition, but the general practice is still 
otherwise. But if the rank and file of our people could 
only know of the evils that the political control of such 
institutions inflicts on multitudes of those who ought not 
to be compelled to suffer one extra pang — if they could 
be made to realize this, they would sweep the system 
away at a single blow. 
I once knew a case where the governor of a state 
sent word to the superintendent of one of these institu- 
tions to make a place for two of his nieces as teachers 
in the school. Neither of the young ladies had ever 
had a particle of training for the special work that such 
teachers had to do. Worse than that, they both hated 
the work, and only did it because they were poor! I 
saw their wretched attempts in their schoolrooms, and 
when I asked the superintendent why he permitted such 
teachers to remain in the institution, he told me who 
they were, and how they came to be where they were. 
“And if I dismiss them, I lose my place,” he added! 
In a state institution for the idiotic, whose manage 
ment had recently been changed to pay a political debt, 
I once saw three children strapped to their beds and 
left alone in a locked room for hours! In the corner 
of this same room a poor paralyzed idiotic boy sat, 
strapped fast ina chair! He could move neither hand 
nor foot; and, it being a hot midsummer day and the 
windows of the room unscreened, the flies were all over 
his face and hands, and he could not brush them away! 
As the door opened and I came into the room, the little
-P-A-G-E-281

fellow turned his eyes towards me and called out 
“mama” in a voice that would break your heart! It 
was the only word he could speak ; and, oh, the pathos 
ofit, as he uttered it! 
Before we entered this room, the matron, who was 
showing me through the building, said, “I guess we 
had better not go in there,” and she turned toward 
another door. 
And I said, “ Why not?” 
“Because,” she replied, “that is the worst hole in the 
house |” 
Aad I said, ‘Oh, don’t call it a hole!” 
Whereupon she responded, “If you should see it, 
you couldn’t call it anything else!” 
And I said, “ I want to see it!” . 
Then she unlocked the door, and I saw what I have 
just told about. 
As the little boy in the corner cried “mama,” the 
Poor Woman who was my pilot broke down completely, 
and said, “Oh, Mr. Smith, I don’t know that God will 
er forgive me for what I am doing here! It is ter- 
tible, terrible!” And she sank down upon the edge of 
one of the beds, dropped her head on her arms, and 
Sted in despair, 
And I said, “ What makes you do it, then?” 
“Because,” she replied, “I don’t know how to do 
uy better! I have never had any experience’ in such 
Work, Tam doing the best I know how, but I don’t 
W what to do!” 
he then went on to explain that her son-in-law, who 
4d been a country doctor and a local politician of con- Siderable Prestige, had recently been appointed by the 
*W governor as superintendent of the institution;

“that he had made her matron, to keep as much of the 
- money in the family as possible! ‘ For we have always 
‘been poor,” she said! She also told me that the old 
‘teachers had “all been dismissed, and none of the new 
ones: knew what to do with such children as were in 
‘that room.” And that was why they were as they were! 
s:, This matron was a good woman; at least she told the 
truth when she said she was doing the best she knew 
how.» But, oh, good people, the day must come when 
the like of this shall not be possible. The wail of that 
paralytic idiot boy, tied in his chair, and the helpless 
“Mutterings of those three children strapped to their beds

changes had again been made in management, for the 
same political reasons. The place was scrupulously 
clean, the children had good food and clothing, and 
were well cared for, so far as their bodies were con 
' cerned. But that was about all. The superintendent 
was, only another doctor-politician, and the teachers 
and. assistants were all in their places because of 
political prestige. Not one of them had ever had 
any special training for such places as they held, and 
_there was an air of any-way-to-get-along about the et 
tire institution. I did not meet a soul about the place 
that I felt had any idea whatever of what the words 
“love” and “sympathy” meant, or might mean, in the 
premises. It all seemed to me as exploited on the com- 
monest material plane, with never an idea or an action 
that extended much above the waistline of all parties 
concerned.
-P-A-G-E-283
CONCERNING INSTITUTIONS 275 
When I compared this institution with another, in a 
neighboring state, which I once. visited, the contrast 
was most marked. In this latter I saw the best peda- 
gogical work I have ever set my eyes on. I saw some 
fifty idiotic boys, some of them exceedingly “short” in 
many ways, at work making brushes of various kinds. 
Their attainments were something wonderful. A good 
many of the brushes were of the coarser kind, the mak- 
ing of which did not call for any very delicate manipula- 
tin, Others were of fine quality, and required great 
skill for their successful construction. But all the work 
was well done, and the boys worked at it with a will. 
The teacher was a practical brush maker, who loved the 
work and the boys he taught how to doit. I never saw 
such devotion and skill embodied in a teacher as was 
manifested by this man. And his boys (he called them 
boys) were happy, cheerful, and getting on. What 
More was needed ? : 
But — : : . 
Two years later I visited the same institution. This 
Wonderful teacher was gone, and the brush shop was 
thsed! The boys were lounging about, or were herded 
in rooms, or on the lawn, in charge of “keepers.” It 
Was the same old story. There was a new governor. 
He had made a clean sweep of the personnel of the in- 
stitution, and his political helpers, men and women, were 
tow in charge, their sole qualifications being that they 
done good work during the campaign! 
The place was clean, the children were well fed, and 
Saw no signs of their physical abuse. But I saw 
Nothing in the way of special provisions for their partic- 
Wer condition. It was all on the material plane, with 
% recognition of the possibility of anything more.
-P-A-G-E-284
  276. ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
There was some attempt at routine schoolroom work, 
of the regular graded school sort, but it amounted to 
little or nothing. Not one child in a hundred in the 
‘institution could do anything with it worth mentioning. 
'. Some of the teachers had done that kind of work before 
-in-public schools. That was claimed by the governor 
.as proof positive that they were fit for their places. 
For is not teaching teaching? Truly so! 
- Several of these teachers were bright and pleasant 
young women, but I saw only one that was at all fitted 
for the work they were all trying to do. I do not ac- 
cuse them personally. It is the political system that 
T condemn. That is wholly bad. And, because it is 
“wholly bad, it must go. It is a bad thing, help push it 
along.. You I am talking to. 
And, one of these days, when the system and the 
institutions it runs have both passed away (the institu 
tions will remain long after the political system that now 
runs them is gone—will remain, I believe, to do a0 
untold amount of good in the way of pioneer work, in 
discovering how best to handle each special kind of 
“shorts” committed to their care; and then, having 
served their special purposes in the order of things, 
they too, will retire), when both these have passed, then 
we shall have so well learned how and what to do for 
these variants from the normal, that we will make 
places for them in our public schools, where they can 
grow up in natural surroundings, and so come to fill 
their natural places in human society. Such a com 
summation may be a very long ways off, is doubtlessly 
so, but some day it will come. And it is your business 
and mine to help it arrive.

True Mission of Drudgery. , 
Iw one of her most clever sketches, Agnes Repplier 
tls how she and her schoolgirl chums used to “make 
ts” To make an act consisted in deliberately and 
tposely doing something that one naturally disliked 
‘odo, some duty whose performance went against the 
fain, She goes on to tell what credits they were given 
Uschool for making acts, and how they kept a tally of 
them, out of which they made “bouquets of good 
teeds,” which were duly presented to their teachers‘on 
tive occasions. All of which was counted as of great 
oral worth and a means of educational discipline to 
the girls, : 
As Miss Repplier tells it, she has her fling at th 
Practice, and perhaps with good reason, all the items in 
tte case, as she was obliged to practice them, being 
tken into account. None the less, the fact remains 
that there is virtue gained by making acts, if only the 
atts made are of the right kind. And right there some: © 
hing needs to be said, since this idea is closely related 
. 277
-P-A-G-E-286
278 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
" to the education of all the children of all the people, as 
this has so far been attempted and worked out. 
“IT have always admired the old woman who said, 
“What God and circumstances put on me I'll try to 
. stand and keep good natured about; but what John 
and the old man are to blame for, I’ll be bound if I'll 
put up with!” 
“There is a whole lot of cant and nonsense, not to say 
wretched tyranny, current in this business of “making 
_ acts” in life, not of the kind Miss Repplier speaks of, 
perhaps, but of a similar sort, in all kinds of places, that 
‘we have to meet with. It is held by the pronounced 
advocates of the dogma that it cultivates virtue to the 
highest extent to do just what one is told to do, no 
matter what, and ask no questions and make no replies. 
But the fact is, it makes all the difference in the world 
what the cause is that stands behind the required obe- 
dience, as to the virtue that is forthcoming from con 
formity to its dictates. If the compelling agency is “ God 
and circumstances,” as the old lady put it, making acts 
from such cause will develop virtue of the divinest 
quality. For this cause martyrs have gone to the stake, 
and Jesus hung upon the Cross. Let no one say one 
single word against the sacrifice of one’s selfish desires 
on the altar of duty which is God-born. 
But all this is one thing, and being compelled to do 
things merely because “ John and the old man” say 8% 
is quite another thing, and right there is where the dit 
ficulty arises. It was the like of these latter “acts 
that Miss Repplier reviled. 
There has been no more frequent sin, through all 
the ages, than for selfish men and women to set UP 
their own authority and label it the will of God
-P-A-G-E-287
“MAKING AN ACT” 279 
virtually that. Nor has this sinning been confined to 
the church — any chureh —more than to other forms 
of centralized power. True, most churches have: been 
guilty of the practice, to a greater or less extent, at 
some period in their history; but equally, or more 
guilty, have ‘been kings, emperors, presidents, govern- 
018, parliaments, congresses, legislatures, parents, school- 
teachers, and the whole line of those who are “in au- 
thority,” 
T suppose the reason for this is to be found, not in 
ww own innate depravity, but in the infiniteness of our 
ndividuality. The fact is, we are each of us so great, 
inour inmost selves, that there is an inherent desire for 
omnipotence on the part of every one of.us,.and we are 
Wont to mistake the wish of our own hearts for the 
wice of Deity itself. I think few cases of tyranny 
‘ould ever be found where the tyrant could not justify 
himself and his acts, if his side of the story alone were 
bid. All tyrants are not bad-meaning men. Indeed, it 
tight be truthfully said that they are all well-meaning 
Ten, from their own viewpoint. Most excellent men 
‘tad the tenderest-hearted women have justified slavery, 
fom the earliest times; and the most exacting school- 
Tasters, or set-in-their-ways schoolmarms, are cocksure 
that their requirements are not only just and right, but 
that they are the best means for compassing the proper 
tducation and development of the children under their 
Cate, 
And so, in passing judgment on these and others like 
| , we need to be merciful, even as we would have 
| show mercy. I may need mercy myself, even for 
| Words I am now writing! ‘Such as you and I” 
a wide range! 
|
-P-A-G-E-288
    
     
     289. ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
  But mercy must have its limit, like every other good 
‘thing; or, the first thing we know, it will fall on the 
other side and result in an evil that is worse than the 
one it was set to mend. 
And so, to come to the point that is germane to the 
subject in hand, namely, what all this has to do with 
the education of all the children of all the people, there 
“'g-very little good that can ever come to a pupil by 
orcing him to “make an act” which is based solely on 
he whim, or notion, or caprice, of some one, or a whole 
Jot of ones, who are in authority over him. More than 
that, for a pupil to yield obedience to such demands 
without protest or attempt to be free from the thraldom, 
breeds a spirit of unquestioning servitude, stultifies the 
intellect and dwarfs the soul, and tends to make the 
pupil more of a slave than a man. And that is why 
the state has a right to look after this matter. 
It may be said (and doubtless will be, by some whe 
read these pages) that there is small need of preaching 
the doctrine of freedom and independence to American 
children; but do not the records of every year since 
we have been in existence as a nation teach that it is 
only this spirit which has saved us alive and given us4 
name and a place among the nations of the earth? And 
from whom have protests for the reverse of these things 
come? From those who would maintain their order of 
things, regardless—-from “stand-patters” and_ theif 
likes, Peace, peace, they shout! “Swine, why will ye 
squeal?” they continually do cry. They are not bad 
people who say these things—not bad in some ways 
that are currently called bad. Many of them neither 
swear, nor drink, nor live licentiously ; and yet, if they 
could have their way with those with whom they are out 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
“MARKING AN ACT” 281 
of patience for not doing as they say, they would.soon 
bring about a despotism that would be Russian. 
All this has an especial bearing on the matter of 
forcing courses of study upon pupils; and of school 
government, as it perhaps pertains to them, . The right, 
in both these cases, turns on the basis of authority for 
tequirements imposed. If this is seated only in the 
notions of the dictator, and has no solid backing in the 
ttemal order of things as they pertain to each one who 
isasked to conform —in such case, the good that can 
come from obedience to demands can be, at best, only 
of a negative sort. . 
When the backing of a compulsory course of study is 
only the dictum of men and women who have the 
power to compel its observance, small good can come 
fo the pupil who “makes an act” of undertaking its 
"quirements. If the course and their natural abilities 
tilly, well and good. Then they make no act by con-_ 
forming to it. But if they only do as they are told, or 
48 they are compelled to do if they stay in school at all, 
e good can come to them from such servitude. 
The same principle holds good in the matter of school 
fovernment. All of this that is based on the welfare 
teach child, he being what he is, is good. All else is 
No matter who backs it, or how it is done. 
Which leads me to say that the greatest of care 
hould be taken by teachers in the use of wholesale 
Methods of securing conformity to requirements, no 
Matter how just these may be in a general way. 
For instance: Punctuality is a virtue which our 
*hools should surely inculcate, to the limit, But the 
teacher should never forget that there isa limit. I once 
hw this: A teacher brought a boy of ten to the prin-
-P-A-G-E-290
282 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
- cipal, and said: “Charlie has been tardy again, and 
when I asked him why, he said he slept too late this 
morning. Now, don’t you think that if a boy can’t sleep 
.. enough at home, I had better make him sleep in school, 
where we can all see him do it?” 
And the principal said he thought that would bea 
good thing. So the boy was taken to the schoolroom 
“where he belonged, some shawls were spread on the 
“floor near the teacher’s desk, and on these the little 
fellow was compelled to lie down in the presence of his 
‘laughing: schoolmates. He was as pale as a ghost 
when he lay down, his hands were cold, and his teeth 
chattered as if he had the ague. But that made no 
difference! He was habitually tardy, and his bad habit 
had to be broken up. That was the why of it all. 
Now this teacher did not mean to be bad. She was 
really a kind-hearted woman, in most things. And she 
was. trying to do her duty, ina way. But she was a 
tyrant, so far as this boy was concerned. And I will 
tell you why. 
The woman who taught drawing in that building, and 
80 went from room to room, happened to be present 
when this boy was disgraced before the school. She 
said nothing (and she was wise in that she did not 
speak), but she made it her business to follow the boy 
to his home and see his parents. They told her that 
the boy. was “too lazy to draw his breath,” and that he 
“wanted to sleep all the time.” And it struck this 
teacher that this was not a normal condition for a boy 
of ten; and as the parents had only reproaches for the 
little fellow, she, on her own responsibility, took him to 
a physician who knew his business, and asked him to 
examine the child. As soon as the doctor put his hand
-P-A-G-E-291
“MAKING AN ACT” . 983 
onthe boy’s pulse he said: “ Why, this child is suffer. 
ing from a weak heart. It is a marvel that he is alive.” 
The fact was that this boy’s heart was beating only a 
little over forty times in a minute, when it-should have 
heaten seventy-five, and that was the cause of his tardi- 
ness and of his laziness. And when a few weeks’ treat- 
tent had put that heart shipshape, both these defects 
were cured also. All of which is another. Proof that 
“these things are in the body.” 
And what does this truthful tale teach regarding 
“making acts”? It teaches a great many things which 
you know as well as I do, and which we all need to give 
heed to. It teaches, first, that before we say :“‘you 
aust” to a pupil, we should be sure of all the. facts: in 
the case. Second, that there is great danger of’ our. . 
‘cing bad when we mean to be good and are too self- * 
Tighteous to see more than one side of the case. Third, 
that what is often called laziness is really inability. 
And those are three great lessons that every teacher 
ind parent ought to master and hold a diploma vouch- 
ing for efficiency in, before being allowed to have any- 
thing to do with the governing of children. 
Which leads me to say that I would like to write a 
hapter on laziness, if I had room for it. 
But won’t you work it out for yourself? In sword, 
Tyown opinion is that what we condemn (not to say 
In) in people as laziness arises often from inapti- 
fe, or inability, to move out successfully on certain

am very sure how it fits mine. 
Tknow a young man who from his earliest youth has 
branded as lazy. Yet he once rode a bicycle from 
icago to Boston! Would a lazy boy do that? We
-P-A-G-E-292
\.@8q ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
need to reform our definition of this fault. Perhaps 
what we need more than that is to understand it better. 
‘When I traveled with Bill Nye, our manager told me 
that I should find him the laziest man I ever saw. Asa 
matter of fact, I never knew him to rest for a single in- 
Stant. He was averse to physical exercise. But his 
mind was always on the alert. As he said, he could 
"never get his “think tank” to let up for a minute. He 
died from mental overwork at the age of forty-six. Was 
he lazy? 
’ With these hints, you can work out this problem of 
laziness for yourself. But don’t neglect to do it if you 
have lazy children to deal with, either in your family or 
in school. 
And all children are lazy on some lines. They are 
specially liable to be so between the ages of eight and 
fourteen. So many others have treated that fact that! 
need not go into it here. But put all the reasons for 
laziness together, when you work out the problem, and 
act according to what they all say, and then you will 
have less cause to pray for forgiveness for your sins 
against lazy children than you otherwise would. 
This naturally leads to the subject of truancy, om 
which it is truth to say that the great bulk of truancy is 
caused by the unwillingness of children to undertake 
what they have little or no ability to perform. Professor 
Bodine, of Chicago, who has had charge of the truancy 
affairs of that city for a number of years, testifies that 
more than eighty per cent of the cases that he has had 
to deal with are below the fourth grade, and that he 
rarely ever knew of a case of truancy where the child 
was doing well in school and was abreast of his class in 
his grade work. “They are practically all children who 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
“MAKING AN ACT? a8 
do not, or cannot, get along well in the work they are 
required to do in the schoolroom” is the way he ‘put it. 
He told of one “truant” who had been kept in one 
grade for seventy-two weeks, because there was some of 
the work that belonged to that grade which he could not 
master. What wonder that such a boy was. a. truant? 
The marvel is that he did not commit suicide! 
Which brings us back to the same old point; namely, 
that we must make our schools fit the pupils if we com- 
telthe pupils to attend them. A truancy law is.a good 
thing, in so far as it keeps all the children in school. 
Butit needs to be supplemented by work in these. ‘schools 
that shall be suited to the needs of all the children we 
lgally compel to attend them. And it will be. Need I protest, once more, that in saying these things 
Tam not advocating happy-go-lucky, any-old-way: meth- 
ls in school government and work? I am.doing no 
‘uch thing. I will even go farther and declare that I 
“tiously doubt whether “ moral suasion” is a sufficiently 
botent force to make our schools a success. There are 
Tany cases where, things being as they are, “the stern 
hand of the law” is the only power that will keep things 
Moving as they should. All I ask for is, that when this 
‘me stern hand of the law gets in its work, it should do 
© on the lines of justice, decency, and common sense, 
‘td not merely in the execution of its own arbitrary 
Power, 
Ineed not extenuate. Every right-mindéd person 
Wto reads these lines knows what I mean; and for the 
"st, there is no use in talking. Yet even these will see 
things right some day. The world does move. If we 
Compel our children to “make acts,” let us be sure we 
te tight in doing so, all the facts being taken into the
-P-A-G-E-294
286 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
account. Then such “making” will be good for them 
Otherwise not. 
I am tempted just here to pursue this theme further 
along the line of school government and its related sub- 
jects, but space forbids. I must remark, however, that 
T believe the method of having the pupils of the higher 
grades in our publi¢ schools govern themselves is a 
move in the right direction; and that it will one day 
largely obtain in these departments. It is all of the 
right sort, the development of self-controlling indi- 
viduals, It is not an easy way to go. Its early experi- 
mentation and exploitation will be crude and full of 
errors; all sorts of ignominy will be heaped upon it by 
monarchical unbelievers and those who lack faith in all 
mankind; but, in spite of it all, I believe the method of 
self-government in the higher grades of our public Schools will win its way to the front. It has the right 
marks upon it, and so it must succeed. 
Perhaps I ought to add that I do not at all ignore the 
fact that there are a great many things, in the lives of 
all of us, that we must do whether we like to or not. 
There is more or less drudgery for us all. And drudg- 
ery has its place in the development of virtue, doubtless. 
All I insist on is that we and our children should not be 
made to drudge simply for drudgery’s sake. We should 
all learn to do unpleasant tasks when we must, but that 
must should be “God or circumstances,” and not the 
dicta of some one who merely wants to compel us to 
obey his will, That is, we should not do disagreeable 
things merely to “make acts.” We should do them 
with pleasure when genuine duty requires. Such “made 
acts,” bunched together, will surely make most fragrant 
and beautiful “bouquets of good deeds.”

Word for all that. And it is in its good sense that I in- toduce it here, as germane to the issue of educating all 
the children of all the people so that they may become 
§00d citizens, as they would not all become but for the 
tducation which the state gives them. As I use the 
Word “manipulation” here, itmeans thechanging of things 
fom a cruder to a more perfect condition, through the 
4gency of human deeds. Man finds things in a certain 
late, or condition; and by manipulation he changes 
them so that they shall better serve his needs. That 
Sa simple way of saying what I mean by manipulation. 
And the progress of the human race has always been 
Neasured by the growth of the power to manipulate, on 
the part of mankind. When man had no manipulative 
Power he was on a par with the rest of the animals.

But when he put an edge on a piece of stone, and used 
that to fight with or to chop wood with, then he left the 
ranks of the mere brute creation and began his ascent 
ofthe ladder of mental and spiritual progress. And 
evety step that he has gained in his upward climb has 
been at the hands of his ability to manipulate something. 
T, need not work out the details. You can do that as 
well as I can, now that you have the idea. 
This manipulative ability on the part of mankind 
manifests itself in a million ways. It deals not only 
with stone and steel — wood, hay, and stubble — but it 
busies itself with the stuff that dreams are made on, 
with ideas, and the highest spiritualities. The range of 
its work is limitless, and wherever it leads the way, there 
a larger civilization follows. But wherever its hand is 
stayed, stagnation results, 
Now manipulation is a quality that can be transmitted 
from one generation to another. The fathers can show 
us how.and what they did; we can learn their ways, and 
so can plant our feet on the round of the ladder that 
they stood on, to say the least. And then, if we are 
what we ought to be—if we will do as much for the 
future as the past has done for us, we will proceed to do 
some manipulation on our own behalf, and so the race 
will progress a little more, the world will be some better 
for our having lived in it. This is the story of the growth 
of civilization through manipulation. 
And when the one who knows how shows some one 
who doesn’t know how the way to do what he of the first 
part does, and succeeds in getting the party of the second 
part to do as well, or better, than he of the first part does, 
that is teaching that counts. All else is a fake.

things that could be done became so great that no. one 
man could master it all. 
Then began the practice of teaching the mere story 
of what had been done, instead of the doing of the 
same! And right there is where both ‘teachers and 
schools began to make a great mistake. Of course, the 
Tecords of what had been done must be preserved. So 
uch was right. But a mere memory knowledge of a. 
"cord of what has been done is a far different thing.

‘what had been done, rather than on doing some of the 
things themselves, then they set their feet in a wrong 
path. And some of them have gone a long way on this 
-, wrong road, and they are still loath to leave it. 
“" Because, you see, it is only the ability to do something 
“that ‘makes a human being of value to himself and his

‘doné is a very small factor in civilization. He can add 
‘butt very little to the progress of the race. A citizen is 
of value to society and the state only as he has the 
ability to-help society and the state to be better because 
-he-is a member of them. And whoever fails to do this 
is a burden and not a blessing to all parties concerned. 
The’ state cannot afford to make burdens for itself to 
carry. It must get returns for the money and effort 
expended in trying to make helpful men and women 
out of helpless children. 
_ A great deal of what was once of value by way of 
manipulative ability has fallen into the rubbish heap, 
time has gone on. It may be well enough that the 
record of all this sort be preserved; but the day of the 
utility of longer bothering our heads very much about 
it has long gone by. Surely we have no right to de 
mand that all the children of all the people shall mem-

manipulation which was done in former times. There 
is a place in this world for the economic use of a waste- 
basket.

rather than their memorization, then we shall have 4

“here-for us to travel, what unexplored fields for us to

+ And herein lies the inspiration for all true teachers, 
the goal that lures them on. Columbus made a great 
addition to the world’s map, and to human possibilities, 
when he found the western world. What new worlds 
may you and I yet find, in the unsailed seas of human 
possibilities that are open in every schoolroom! Such 
possibilities are always present, and this is why the call- 
ing of the teacher is the greatest of all. If only we can 
so manipulate these possibilities that they shall ultimate 
for the utmost. 
‘I cannot leave this phase of the subject without 
recurring once more to the doctrine that forms the 
basis of all I have to say in this treatise; namely, that it 
is of little use to try to teach pupils to manipulate stuff 
which they have no natural aptitude for handling. The 
simple truth is that only such manipulation as can be 
carried on with clear and intelligent thought on the part 
of the manipulator is of real value as an educative force, 
or as a former of character. And along lines where 
there is little or no native ability, it is practically im- 
possible to secure definite, clearly defined thinking ~- 
certainly nothing fresh and original and which will be 
of real benefit to the individual doing the work, and to 
the community of which he is a part. 
Of course the reader will take into account the fact 
that native abilities do not always all reveal themselves 
"at once in the lives of some individuals, as I have more    
 
-P-A-G-E-301

than once declared in what I have already said. Some- 
times they do not appear till manhood is fully attained, 
so far as years are concerned. My point is, that it is 
not wise to try to develop manipulative power where no 
tative ability is manifest. If such ability appear soon 
or late, make the most of it, but do not make a pupil 
“go through the motions” where there are no signs of 
such ability. : : 
And, withal, every teacher should make a most earnest 
effort to exploit manipulative ability that has stuff in it. 
When a girl is taught chiefly how to manipulate a fan, 
or to do the conventional thing in society, she is not 
being fairly dealt with, so far as her education is con- 
cemed. When a boy is taught how to be a dandy, and 
to spend money regardless, in a word, to be “a good 
fellow,” he is sinned against by those who plan his 
education on such lines, or who allow him to do so. 
The fan may be a woman’s weapon, and Chesterfieldian 
Manners doubtless have their place, to a degree, among 
tuly well-bred men; but merely these, and little or 
nothing besides, make a poor outfit fora successful 
American citizen. Grace in women and polite bearing 
on the part of men are items by no means to be left 
Sut of the account. It is only when they are given 
Undue prominence, that makes them conspicuous rather 
than subsidiary, that fault should be found in this 
Tegard. Common sense and not conventionality, the 
Spirit and not the letter, will keep us right here, as 
tkewhere, always. 
All of which means that “vocational” studies, rather,: 
than merely “cultural” studies, as such, should form the 
bulk of the training given to all the children of all the 
People, in our public schools.

and Ability. 
Tue matter of the manipulation of books, briefly noted 
in the last chapter, naturally leads to a discussion of 
what such work is chiefly for; namely, the securing of a 
knowledge of literature through the medium of reading. 
Reading comes first in this discussion, and hence a few 
words regarding it. I cannot treat fully of the methods 
of acquiring a mastery of the art of reading, but I can 
note a few leading and significant principles which cover 
the whole ground. 
The first acquirement to be gained in order that one 
_May be a successful reader, in the largest sense of that 
phrase, is such mechanical mastery (manipulation) of 
the art of gathering words off the page with the eye 
that there shall be no conscious effort in the act. 
. 294
-P-A-G-E-303
READING AND LITERATURE . 295 
Of course, my critic may contend that if one does not 
comprehend the meaning of the words thus gathered by 
the eye, such reading is in vain. Which is correct. 
But the point I want to make is, that this mechanical 
act comes first in the natural order of the process of 
teading, and until it is mastered, little progress can else- 
where be made; and that this fact has often been ig- 
nored, or lost sight of, in the teaching of the art. Thus, 
of late years, it seems to me too much stress has been 
laid upon the “thought content” of what was read, to 
the exclusion of the business of getting the words off 
the page with neatness and dispatch. This criticism 
applies almost entirely to the lower grades, where the 
fault is most in evidence. In much of the reading work 
done in these grades, more attention has, of late years, 
been paid to “analysis” of what is read than to gather- 
ing the words with the eye. I cannot believe this to be 
tither wise or right. 
The way to learn to read is to read, and to keep doing 
it In psychological phrase, the mechanical act must 
@ so mastered that it can be relegated to the sub- 
Conscious self before that part of the art of reading is a 
Success, And when that work is brought to such per- 
fection that it will “do itself,” then one has all of his 
tind free to think of what one is reading about. That 
is the true philosophy of the art of successful reading.

-- «where it is hard work to master the mechanical work of 
“reading. There can be no successful gathering of the 
*. thought which words are set to convey until one can 
“easily manipulate the words themselves. 
4, (Lhardly need say that it is only silent reading that I 
~ am-speaking of here; namely, the art of gathering the 
“thought of the author from the printed page. Oral 
xeading, with its adjunct of elocution, is a most interest- 
ing-theme, but it is too far afield for me to consider in 
these pages. On these topics “there has been so much 
said, and on the whole so well said, that I will not occupy 
space, etc,”) . 
The work to be done in learning the mechanical part 
of reading is akin to the “finger exercise” of the piano 
player. Itis largely a matter of physical dexterity, of 
technique, if you will, and there is only one way of ac- 
quiring it for most people, — namely, by continual and 
unintermitting practice. So our pupils in school need to 
read, read, read, and so they will acquire the mechanical 
ability to manipulate books. That is, most of them will. 
Of course, all the while they are doing this they can 
be practicing on reading that is worthy their time and 
attention. . No finger exercise is to be practiced merely 
for its own sake. No reading should be required from 
a pupil merely as an eye gymnastic. The point is clear 
for those who have eyes to see. 
And as one masters the mechanical part of reading, a 
knowledge of literature grows apace if the work is done 
as it should be. But here guiding posts need to be set 
up, and directive lines run —a few at least. 
When the pupil begins the study of literature, as such 
(and even before that), it is essential that both he and 
his teacher should have a clear conception of what
-P-A-G-E-305
READING AND LITERATURE 207 
literature really is, and then of what they are going to 
do about it. 
What do you think literature is? I wish you would 
try to define it. I have tried, and here is the result of 
my effort. 
Literature, that is worth while, is a record of those ex- 
periences and those ideals of humanity that are of suffi- 
cient value to make them worthy of being perpetuated ; 
and it is the business of the study and teaching of litera- 
ture in our public schools to make the future experiences 
and the ideals of humanity better than the experiences 
and the ideals of the past have ever been. 
Tam well aware that this definition of literature and 
of its purpose as an educative factor in our public 
schools will be deemed far too utilitarian by many who 
Tead these lines. But my notion is that this judgment 
will not be lasting, and that the more the subject is 
considered from this viewpoint, the clearer the truth 
will appear. 
Because, the fact is that there have been an infinite 
Xumber of fallacies held in the past on this subject of 
literature, and its mission to mankind. For the most 
Part, these may all be massed in a single group; and 
all the wrong-goings, both in the making and accepting 
of literature, so called, may be summed up on this one 
charge, namely, the counting of form as substance, the 
mistaking of a graven image for the living spirit of God. 
What mountains of alleged literature are plucked up 
and cast into the sea of oblivion by such an analysis! 
What multitudes of its makers are engulfed at the same 
time, and how they all sink out of sight together! All 
the sticklers for mere form, al! the copyists and imita- 
tors, all the writers of words for words’ sake, all the
-P-A-G-E-306
“\g98 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
., inventors of high-sounding phrases which have been 
‘reckoned great only because of their sonority, all the 
'. word painters whose chief aim it has been to startle or 
    : astound, all the “retailers of platitudes delivered in an 
ordtund voice” —all of these, and of those like them, 
are swept away so that the places that once knew them 
_will know them no more forever. 
All of which means that art for art’s sake, so far as 
literature is concerned, is a fraud, that is, counting 
this phrase as it is ordinarily understood, namely, the 
. formulating of anything, with no purpose beyond that 
of the form of the thing formed. Language was in- 
tended to express ideas, and whenever it is diverted 
from such purpose it is misused, not to say abused. So 
the men who talk when they have nothing to say, oT 
who write merely to fill columns, are not making litera- 
ture; and it is a sin to make people waste time listening 
to the first, or reading what the second have set down, 
merely spoiling clean white paper thereby. 
Again, there is ever so much that has been written and 
said in the past that has served its time, has had its day, 
and so is no longer of worth to humanity, except as @ 
curiosity, or as a relic. As such, it may be of brief in- 
terest, just as mummies and fossils have a certain his- 
torical value. And for such purpose there can be no valid 
objection to their preservation and use. But, beyond 
this, they should not be permitted to have a place in the 
working outfit of modern life. Their sphere is in mu- 
seums and curiosity shops. They have reached the realm 
of the “has-beens”; they are virtually dead, and for the 
most part the dead should be buried. The grave is 4 
very useful institution in this world, and it is not kind te 
any one too long to deprive it of its dues.
-P-A-G-E-307
READING AND LITERATURE 299 
This is why the great bulk of monarchical literature is 
fast passing away as a living force in human society. 
Shakespeare’s plays, those that have to do chiefly with 
royalty, are no longer popular upon the boards, not be- 
cause we have no actors great enough to present them, 
but because the spirit of democracy has taken such a hold 
upon the minds of the people of to-day that they have 
lost interest in what happened to kings and queens, as 
such, in the days gone by. 
Not but that Shakespeare most successfully did his 
work in depicting royalty. There is no question about 
that, or about his great art in doing what he did. What 
he wrote was once great literature. Both as to form 
and in spirit he made a most perfect record of the ex- 
Periences and ideals of the royalty he dealt with. The 
only trouble is that many of the experiences and ideals 
he depicted are no longer worthy of being perpetuated ; 
they can no longer be made to serve in making the 
experiences and ideals of democratic humanity, now and 
yet to be, better than those of monarchical humanity 
once were, That is the crux of the whole situation. 
en themes of Shakespeare have “lived their little

courtly dames,

Blazoned by Shakespeare's purple page, 
And dirged by Tennyson’s sweet sad rhyme,” 
This is not saying that Shakespeare and Tennyson 
have “ forever passed.” There is much in them both

- that-will still abide. Their style will remain, although 
-that on which much of that style was exploited has 
“< passed away. There is also a large amount of their 
“subject matter that is still alive. Wherever these men 
wrote of the fundamental issues which are common to 
~> all. races and all peoples, in all times and everywhere, 
‘they struck chords that will never cease to vibrate while 
“the world endures, and the style they used in exploiting © 
these themes will never perish from off the earth. 
“Therefore there are distinctions among themes, in 
the writings of both these men, that should always be 
held in mind by those who would utilize, for all the 
children of. all the people, the experiences and ideals 
that these authors have made a record of. The prin- 
ciples involved in the issue are very simple, and they 
are all plain to him that understandeth. All of Shake- 
speare, or Tennyson, or any other authors, that can be 
of use in making better men and women than have ever 
yet been—all these things are of value, and will con- 
tinue to be valuable just as long as they can successfully 
accomplish the work whereunto they are sent. Beyond 
that they are of little use, save as relics. For art’s sake 
alone they are of small value. So long as they cal 
help in making a finer and grander humanity they will 
live, and justly so. 
These principles apply to the makers of literature 
and their product in ali ages and climes, and they need 
to be kept especially in mind by all teachers of literature, 
particularly those who have to deal with the children of 
all the people. Bring any author, or his work, to this 
test, and judgment will not be long delayed. The 
question that every teacher of literature should con 
stantly keep in mind is: Will a knowledge of what J am

trying to impart make the experiences and the ideals of 
my pupils better than they would otherwise be? When- 
ever a teacher can honestly say yes to such an interro- 
gation, there is no danger of going wrong in the work 
done in the literature class, and it is a comparatively 
small affair whence comes the subject matter of their 
teaching. 
On the contrary, if the teacher of literature is forced 
to confess, “I fail to see what good can come from the 
instructions I give,” then, indeed, is her lot a hard 
one, and that of her pupils is harder still. I wish I 
need not say it, but I am forced to record that, in all 
my observations, I have found few teachers of literature 
who have not made the above quoted confession. As 
arule, teachers of literature in our public schools teach 
the pages of literary matter that are required by college 
entrance examinations. This they are forced to do 
by the system they work under, and over which they 
have no control. In large part, the work they are 
forced to do consists in compelling their pupils to mem- 
crize the names of authors and what books they have 
written, with dates to match. Perhaps a few excerpts 
from each author are read, but the author-book-and-date- 
lists are so numerous and extended, and committing 
them to memory is such an arduous task, that there 
is time for little else. 
Can any one tell how such work as this will make the 
experiences and ideals of those who do this drudgery 
better than they would otherwise be? The question is 
fair, and pertinent, and it ought to be answered, 
There is no more powerful influence for good that 
tan be brought to bear upon a pupil than can come 
through the proper study of literature. To teach a
-P-A-G-E-310
  62° ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
     
  i thild to love books, to know authors (just a few, per. 
"haps, and these not necessarily the same for any two 
“-<pupils) through and through, is a work that angels 
- might envy.. The living voice perishes, but the printed 
“page remains. And to lead a pupil to get out of books 
what living and loving souls have put into them, to teach 
boys and girls so that books shall be their dearest friends 
“S=this is something worth while, this is what makes 
* tHeteaching of literature an art filled with divine 
possibilities, 
| And the first requisite for the attainment of such 
results is that the teacher love the literature that 
she tries to teach. Emerson says that “he only can 
give who-has,” and if a teacher has no love for the 
literature she tries to give her pupils a knowledge of, 
she cannot succeed in getting them to love it. And 
unless “hey love it, all the work they do in it amounts to 
little or nothing. It is all a study of “words, words,” 
as Hamlet has it, and these are as useless to the pupil 
as those on the page before him were to the Prince of 
Denmark. 
There is all the difference between life and death in 
the two ways of teaching and pursuing this study. One 
way, there are live human beings, with hearts that 
pulsate with warm red blood, and whose souls shine 
through speaking eyes. The other way there are 
corpses. The teacher who can teach the literature she 
herself loves will lead her pupils into the living way- 
Those teachers who pursue cyclopedic methods will drive 
their pupils through literary graveyards. 
The result of all study and teaching of literature 
should be to inspire the student along the lines of what 
is revealed in the literature studied and taught. No 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-311
READING AND LITERATURE 303 
book read, no poem conned, should stop with itself. 
They should all “continue beyond.” They should give 
tothe student power “to make for himself poems, essays, 
histories,’ or whatsoever. And this should be some- 
thing far and away beyond mere imitation. Both pupil 
and teacher should ever keep in mind that “ Rhymes 
and rhymers pass away,” and that “ poems distilled from 
poems” count for naught. Need it be said that such 
results can never come from repeating what is in a text- 
book, be the same never so good? Nor can they be 
teached by any teacher who teaches only what literature 
she is required to teach by the course. 
Again, it needs to be said that the literature taught to 
all the children of all the people must be democratic, 
both in form and in spirit. Truly, our teachers and 
pupils need to heed the lines : — 
“Come, Muse, migrate from Greece and Ionia; 
Cross out, please, those immensely over-paid accounts. 
On the rocks of your snowy Parnassus 
Placard ‘removed’ and ‘to let.’” 
Good! But when will our teachers and pupils be per- 
mitted to heed the suggestion? Parnassus was good in 
its day, and much of what it stood for has been trans- 
lated into current language and philosophy; but Par- 
hassus for its own sake can be excused, for the most 
Part, from the curricula of the major part of all the 
children of all the people. 
Then, too, there is danger that the teaching of litera- 
ture, upon formal lines, will make mere querulous critics 
of our students. How often have we seen this! Only 
today a mother said to me, when speaking of her son 
who was away at school: “I have gotten so that I al- 
most hesitate to write letters to my boy, for he keeps

‘coming back at me with nagging criticism of my letters 
‘to him.” Surely, the teaching of literature which thus 
results is wide of the mark. The point is really too con- 
-» temptible to be worthy of notice, and my only reason for 
mentioning it is that it is so shamefully common. “Re 
form it altogether,” ye teachers of this sort. 
Beyond question, the future success of this republic is 
dependent on the literature it shall produce. If this is 
live, strong, far-reaching, and deep-descending, of a qual- 
ity that touches the hearts of the masses and stimu- 
lates them to the best there is in themselves, anywhere, 
everywhere, then this nation is safe, and it will grow ia 
the right way, continually. J¢ is ix our public schools that 
the seed that will produce such literature must be sown; 
and this seed must be of a sort that will take root and 
grow in the hearts of all the children of all the people, 
and bear fruit in their lives as citizens of this republic. 
Nothing less will serve. / 
Here, then, teacher, pupil, is the test to bring to all study 
and teaching of literature in our public schools: Will it 
serve on these strong and fundamental lines that pertain 
to successful citizenship? If what you study or teach 
will do this, it is well, and no one will care to ask further 
questions. But if not, then stop taking public money 
for your work, which is of no public use. Work fora 
merely selfish end if you choose to do so, but be honest 
enough not to make the general fund support you. 
What our public schools need, in the matter of teach- 
ing literature, is that the teachers be freed from the 
bondage that now holds them in its thralldom. There is 
scatce a teacher now engaged in this special work who 
could not, and who would not, do most excellent service 
in her peculiar calling if she could be permitted to teach
-P-A-G-E-313
READING AND LITERATURE 305 
what literature she loves to teach, rather than what she 
is compelled to teach in order to serve a purpose that is 
really foreign to her undertaking and desire. 
But, it is said, there must be some standard; we must <_ 
have some common work, or how shall we know what 
to examine our pupils in? Nonsense! Why should I 
be compelled to post myself so that I may answer your 
questions? Why not you answer mine? Why should 
the boy who stands before the professor to be examined 
in literature be forced to give proof of a knowledge of 
books that the professor is learned in? Give the boy a 
chance to tell what 4e knows about books, any books 
that he has read, and of which he can speak, and it is 
easy enough to make up one’s mind as to his abilities 
to do future work. It is the tyranny of the powers 
that be, and not a lack of receptive power on the. part 
of pupils, that retards the true study of literature in our 
Public schools. And let such be anathema! Let there — 
bea democracy in the study and love of real literature 
among all the children of all the people, and so will the 
Procession, all of it, move on.

So much has been written and said upon the subject 
of methods in teaching that one hesitates to add even a 
straw to the burden now on the camel’s back, which is 
already well-nigh broken with its load. And yet I can- 
not refrain from piling my forkful on the top of all. 
But this shall be general, and not particular; and s0, 
perhaps, it will prove to be less weighty. 
The chief word that I want to say on this subject I 
phrase in the vernacular as follows: “Don’t give it to 
the children too fast.” It is by disregarding this simple 
principle of pedagogy that more poor teaching is done 
than in any other one way that I know anything about. 
Any teacher can be brought to realize this fact by 
trying to teach a pupil to do some concrete thing that 
must be done just right in order to be successful at all. 
For instance, suppose you try to teach some one (any one 
will do) how to tie a square knot with a string, and to 
do it right, every time. Try that, some day, and watch 
306
-P-A-G-E-315
SOME THINGS ABOUT METHODS 307 
your process, if you succeed in getting good results. 
Yes, watch your process, anyhow. 
Or, what is a better test still—far better-——take a 
class of a dozen or so and try. to teach them, all at the 
same time, how to tie a square knot, and see how you 
will succeed. Watch your process there, too. 
' This experiment will reveal to you your shortcomings 
asto methods in teaching better than anything I have 
ever tried. If you can take a class of twelve children 
who do not know how to tie a square knot, and at a 
single lesson get half of them so that they can tie such 
a knot right, every time, you are a wonderful teacher. 
And your trial will show you the necessity of definite- 
hess of direction and slowness of procedure as you 
hever saw it before, or I am greatly mistaken. 
We tell our pupils too many different things at once, 4 
and so muddle them. This begets in them the habit of 
trying to do what they only partly understand how to 
do, makes them indefinite in their actions, uncertain in 
their purposes, and untruthful in their work. And all 
this is bad. 
Tlearned this lesson of “not too fast” or “not too 
Much at once” when I was in a factory that I once 
owned and operated. We employed a large number 
of boys in the mill, and they all had to be taught to 
operate the machines they had to handle, so as to get 
good work out of them. Unless they did this success- 
fully, they ruined the lumber they put through the 
machines, and all that they spoiled I had to pay for! 
And it was a marvel how much they could spoil, till I 
learned how to teach them as they needed to be taught 
in order to get good results. Nor was it till my book- 
keeper showed me a balance sheet that proved how we
-P-A-G-E-316
“308 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
were losing money, that I began to study my methods 
“and to see right where the trouble lay. Such study 
showed me that the loss was nearly all my own fault. 
I-had not taught the boys well how to do their work. 
_ Thad given it to them too fast, and too much at a time; 
and they were a lot of slouchy workmen, turning out 
imperfect work, the loss on which came out of my 
pocketbook. 
yf all teachers had to pay for their failures to teach 
well, out of their own pockets, we should have far better 
work done in our schoolrooms than we now have. The 
pocketbook nerve is very sensitive to losses, and it has 
a way of demanding a repair of leaks that is very salu- 
tary. Try teaching some concrete thing, to some one 
whose failure to arrive will cost you money, and then you 
will learn the chief things that pertain to “methods” ia 
teaching. 
And on the heels of this comes the direction “hands 
off!” Ah! That is the hardest of all. It is so much 
easier to do a thing ourselves than it is to teach some 
one else how to do it, that we are all apt —so apt—to 
take things into our own hands and settle it that way. 
Bat this is all wrong. Hands off! Not till you can 
h with your hands tied —I could almost say with 
your tongue tied — will you be a first-class teacher. 
I saw some excellent examples of “hands off” work 
in a manual training school I visited a short time ago 
The teacher stood at his desk and told the boys what — 
just what—to do. He gave his directions with the 
utmost explicitness, in simple language that every pupil 
could comprehend, and he gave them but one at 4 
time. More than that, he was sure that every pupil 
in his class had done exactly what he was told to
-P-A-G-E-317
SOME THINGS ABOUT METHODS 309 
do, just as he was told to do it, before he proceeded 
to the next step. 
And it did require so much patience and such careful 
telling to get these results from @// the pupils! I stood 
by, and it was such a trial to me to keep my own hands 
off. A boy near me was so awkward. I am sure there 
was no possible wrong way that he did not blunder into 
before he got the right way the teacher was trying for. 
But he finally got it. And he got it himself. That’s 
the point. And so he could get it again, the next time. 
And I was once in a class in German where there was 
never to be a word of English spoken, come what might. 
There came up a new word in the lesson, which ‘no 
pupil knew the meaning of. And it would have been 
So easy for the teacher to turn her English tongue 
loose, and tell her pupils the meaning. But, bless 
her dear life, she knew enough to keep her English 
tongue tied. And with what little German her pupils 
were masters of (for it was a “beginning class”) she 
Went to work to get to them the idea which the new 
Word was set to convey. And if you could have seen 
that class, all with knitted brows, and eyes focused on 
the teacher as she talked to them in German, you would 
have learned a great lesson in pedagogy, in this matter of 
keeping hands off. But she won, did this teacher; and 
when she did, her class knew something. How easy it 
Would have been to have said, “ Look it up.” Bah! 
The art of manipulation cannot be acquired by having 
Some one else move your handsfor you. You must move 
them yourself. That is God’s way of teaching how to 
do things. The wise teacher will make note of this and 
act accordingly. 
Hands off !
-P-A-G-E-318
gio ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
Another cautionary word needs to be-said regarding 
the different ways of treating different pupils in the 
same class or grade. A concrete instance will illustrate 
what I mean. I once saw a class in arithmetic working 
on the subject of subtraction. The teacher was putting 
forth her every energy to have her pupils master the 
principle of “ borrowing,” and they were doing their best 
to follow as she led. But in spite of all she could do 
there were some members of the class who could not 
grasp the philosophy of what was done. She was an 
excellent teacher, full of resources, and apt in illustra- 
tion, and she did her best; but it all went for nothing 
with the “slow ones.” 
After the class was dismissed we talked it over, and 
presently T. said: “Why not tell these helpless ones 
just what specific thing to do in order to obtain the re- 
sult, and let it go at that, so far as these pupils are con- 
cerned. 
“T'll try it,” the teacher said. And she did. She 
asked the “shorts” to stay after school with her a few 
minutes (not to disgrace them, but for help), and then I 
watched to see what she would do. And here is what 
she did: She took a not-too-hard problem, to start on, 
and said: “Now when the top figure is less than the 
bottom one, call the top one ten more than it really is; 
then take the bottom one away from this bigger number, 
and write the difference in the same column, under them. 
Then call the next lower figure at the left one more than 
it is, subtract it from the figure over it, and set down the 
answer, and so on.” 
When she gave this last direction, namely, to call the 
next left-hand lower figure one more, she looked at me 
with a sort of reckless, I-don’t-care-if-you-are-here wink,
-P-A-G-E-319
SOME THINGS ABOUT METHODS 311 
and whispered, under her breath, “That’s the way I 
always do myself, and it works all right!” and went ahead 
with her work. And then, mévadile dictu, in ten minutes 
from that time, after working faithfully with the boys 
with this method, she had those pupils actually subtract- 
ing and getting correct answers, every time. Thechildren 
were so astonished they hardly knew themselves, and they 
left the schoolroom kicking up their heels with delight. 
I watched them, and saw them stop at the first corner, 
sit down on the curbstone, and together try a problem, 
all by themselves. Doubtless they were curious to see if 
the plan would work away from the schoolhouse. Tam 
Sure they found it would. 
Does any one object to this? No sensible soul will do 
80. Not that I would advocate this method of teaching 
subtraction to a// children. For those who can compre- 
hend the analysis of the process, such work is good. 
But for those who cannot, the “easy way” is far better 
than none, The method this teacher used, in this case, 
involves a principle that goes a long way in the practical 
work done in the schoolroom. Fear better is it that these 
slow ones should go home happy, and ad/e to do something, 
than that they should leave their schoolroom discouraged, 
or perhaps disgraced, and so generally “at outs” with 
What they were asked to do that they will hardly even 
ty to do anything at all. 
And so, in point of fact, this matter of method resolves 
itself into a very simple proposition, namely, to do for 
each pupil what the needs of each pupil require should 
be done, using our best endeavors to find out just what 
theseneeds are, and the utmost of our ingenuity to meet 
the requirements which the situation calls for. The 
teacher who will work by such method will teach, if she
-P-A-G-E-320
312, ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
has any aptitude for the calling. If she hasn’t, she ought 
not to be tolerated in the schoolroom, no matter what 
method she may use, or where she may have acquired 
it.. The teacher who has to “consult the authorities,” 
for every move she makes, who “has no head of her 
own” for her work, had better try some other calling. 
She ought not to be permitted to teach in our public 
schools, no matter how many diplomas she may be 
possessed of, or how fine a written examination she can 
pass. 
.There can be no itemized method of pedagogy that 
will be of universal application to all the children of all 
the people. We can all get “helps and hints” froma 
thousand and one sources. But the whole business can 
never be put into a book, neither can it be gotten out 
of. a book. Here is-a place where manipulation can 
only be partially transmitted. The ultimate art must 
be individually acquired, and personally exercised; 
and neither acquirement nor exercise can be obtained 
without practice upon the real thing, with flesh and 
blood children, in an actual schoolroom. That is the 
final word about methods in teaching. 
Any method that can be used as a servant to both 
teacher and pupil is good, just so long as it knows its 
place, and will keep.it. Any method is bad, no matter 
where it has. come from, no odds who originated it, if it 
becomes a master, and holds its user in bondage. And 
here is where teachers should arrive through their own 
inspiration. Here is where they should prove them- 
selves greater than any or all “authorities,” and should 
stand in their own strength, sufficient unto themselves, 
and to the work that is given into their own hands. 
Well did Jesus say “call no man master,” and there is
-P-A-G-E-321
SOME THINGS ABOUT METHODS 313 
no place where His words are more forceful than to a 
teacher in a schoolroom. 
The chief trouble with us all, on this score, is that we 
have been unwilling, or afraid, to do our own work in 
our own way. It has been too much bother for us to 
worship God with our own work, as we know we ought 
to; and it is so much easier for us to bow down to some 
man-made or system-made idol that we can easily get 
next to, than it is to work out our own salvation with 
fear and trembling. There is the rub.. We have put 
cur faith in textbooks, and in professors of this or that, L. 
and in the dicta of Associations, and in what those in 
authority have said when in conventions assembled — 
in all these things, rather than in the voice of God in 
our own souls! And therein lies the essential cause of 
most failures to teach school well, or to be possessed of 
methods that will really result in first-class work. 
All these authorities, etc., are good as means. They 
are worthless as ultimates. The true student of methods 
of pedagogy will forage over the whole field of the 
experiences and ideals of other teachers; will listen to 
them all, and note well what they say, will observe them 
all and note well what they do. Then, gently, but with 
undeniable will, he will free himself from all bonds 
that would hold him, and teach as his own soul tells 
him he ought to. It takes nerve to do this, but it 
is done. I have seen it done more than once; yes, 
many times. What we need is to have it the rule 
Tather then the exception. 
Here endeth, then, the chapter on methods. You 
tan make them for yourself. No one can make them 
for you.. Others can suggest, and perhaps direct, but 
you must ultimately settle the business for yourself.

The only question is, will you do it? If you try it, be 
- wise and not foolish in your doing. Don’t be a narrow 
bigot in the premises, and make your bigotry an excuse 
for doing just as you please, regardless of everything 
and everybody. That is far worse than merely follow- 
ing a leader. The proof of the worth of your methods 
(and they must be brought to the trial) is your success 
in keeping all the children in your school, and in doing 
the best possible work for each one of them while they 
- are there. If you can do that, your methods are good, 
no-matter where they have come from. If you fail to 
“do this, your methods are faulty. There is no appeal 
from this conclusion. God is the judge, and there is no

1 aw well aware that I am entering a jungle of thought 
and feeling when I set out to say even a few words about 
morals and religion in our public schools. Concerning 
the first, the way is open and fairly well trod for a space ; 
but regarding the second, there is largely undergrowth 
and tangle where some day there will be a royal road to 
God. If I can help, just a little, in making a prelimi- 
nary survey for such a public highway on these two sub- 
jects, one which all the children of all the people can 
travel in, I should be glad and thankful beyond all telling. 
In both these matters, the underlying principle is as 
Simple as all great basic motive forces always are. The 
main issue is what will make good citizens of all the 
children of all the people. Whatever will do this has a 
315
-P-A-G-E-324
316 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
rightful place in our public schools, both as regards 
morals, and, equally so, as regards religion. The only 
pinch comes when we attempt to consider what the spe- 
‘cific things are that will bring about the desired results. 
There is where we quarrel and part company, so many 
of us. There is where all the friction arises. These are 
the things that obstruct the way and make the whole 
subject a jangle of discord and distrust, rather than a 
place of harmony and good faith. 
But now, is it not possible for people who dwell to- 
gether in love in so many other ways and places, to come 
under the same spirit in these regards? It surely seems 
as though it ought to be so. Anyhow, let us reason to- 
gether over the situation for a few pages, and then see. 
In the matter-of morals in school there is not very 
much lack of agreement. There are still some parents 
who rebel if their children are “made to mind” in 
school, but these are so few and far between that they 
are hardly a recognizable factor in the problem. For 
the most part, our people recognize the fact that obedi- 
ence to rightful control is a fundamental quality in a 
good citizen, and hence they stand for the cultivation of 
this virtue in our public schools. So far, so good. 
There are also some people who are anxious about 
the coeducation issue, who suspect the results which 
they fear may come from having boys and girls go to 
the same school. . This feature is chiefly in evidence in 
cities, especially in those in which there is a considerable 
constituency that has high regard for conventional 
ideas having their roots among the aristocracy across 
the water. Among these, the medieval notion prevails 
that sex is something of a mistake, at best, and that the 
error should be hidden from knowledge, as far as pos
-P-A-G-E-325
MORALS AND RELIGION 317 
sible, especially amongst girls. They ostensibly hold 
to the her-soul-was-like-a-star-and-dwelt-apart idea, the 
ignorance-is-bliss theory, for femininity. In some circles 
this cult is growing in this country, manifesting itself 
in the genesis of the chaperon, a creature who was a 
stranger to our fathers and mothers, who “sparked” 
unwatched, and were blameless ! 
However, these need give us but small concern. 
- God’s eternal laws do not suffer to any great extent, or 
for long, at the hands of society’s peccadillos. “Male 
and female created he them,” and there was no mistake 
in the act. That is the way things are, and they will 
stay so. Boys and girls are born into the same family, 
and it requires men and women, both, to make a suc- 
cessful civilization. 
To be sure, there may be room for experiment as to 
whether it is wise and best for boys and girls to pursue 
the same studies in school; but that can all be provided 
for under the new order of “electives” in our schools. 
But the individuals of each sex need the modifying, re- 
straining, stimulating, and truly spiritualizing influences 
of their opposites, during the growing years of their 
lives in school. Of this there can be no doubt, in the 
eternal order of things. 
Then there is the question of permitting, or forcing, 
children of all social grades to mingle together in the 
same school. The moral results of such community are 
hot infrequently challenged by those who are counted 
as “our best people.” And that there are some serious 
issues involved, just here, is not to be denied. But, as 
a matter of fact, the dangers are few, and the possible 
benefits to all parties concerned are as many as they 
are great.
-P-A-G-E-326
318 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
_ As an exterminator of the class microbe, the public 
' school has no equal. Or, to change the figure, the 
public school is the womb of genuine democracy; the 
- fruitful soil which brings forth bountiful crops of true 
. brotherhood and enduring fraternity. It is not a 
leveler, but a builder-up of all parties concerned. It 
cuts out the cancers of conceit that tend to destroy the 
vitality and virility of wealth and aristocracy; and it 
burns away the plague-spots of prejudice and hatred 
that are so deeply rooted in the body of the rank and 
_ file. It plants healthy love and wholesome respect for 
all in the hearts of all the children of all the people, 
and as a social force, for the establishment of a civiliza- 
tion baséd on the eternal principles of truth and justice, 
the world has never seen its equal. 
And these are the things that must never be forgotten; 
nay, that must be emphasized, in all our estimates of 
the real value of our public schools. All criticisms re- 
garding their faults, either as they have been or as they 
now are, should be tempered, and modified, and in large 
measure excused, by our acknowledgment of the inesti- 
mable blessing they have already proved themselves to 
be as makers of democracy. All their past and present 
shortcomings are as nothing when compared with the 
great results they have yielded, on the lines of good 
fellowship and love, amongst all classes of people. 
There is not one who reads these lines who cannot 
verify the truth of this, in his or her own life. Think 
of the men and women, in all ranks of life, whom you 
now hold in high esteem because of the knowledge of 
them that you gained in the public school. 
And whatever modifications we make in these schools, 
let them be by way of intensifying their democracy, of
-P-A-G-E-327
MORALS AND RELIGION 319 
broadening their power to make friends and lovers of 
all who enter their doors. Let us‘plan to make them 
include rather than exclude; to gather all and to reject 
none; and to be able and fit to do all this with the 
utmost success, for the best interest of all and each. 
For so shall our schools become a moral force that shall 
be worthy the financial and patriotic support of every 
citizen, without exception. 
A resident of New York City once said to me: “Go 
down to the lower end and see what we do for the boys 
and girls down there. We take them in by the ship- 
load, when they don’t know a word of English, and in 
six months we have them singing the ‘Star Spangled 
Banner’ to beat the band!” He was right. And he 
might have gone on to say that if you would follow 
these same children up through the schools, you would 
Presently find that you could hardly tell them from the 
“native born” —those who stayed by till they got 
through the high school. Their twelve years of dis- 
Cipline in this institution (which some one has called the 
great American stomach) have digested them and trans- 
formed the product into blood, bone, fiber, and spirit 
Such as good citizens are made of. A single genera- 
tion wipes out almost the last vestige of the “foreign” 
in all such cases, and ¢heir children are Americans, all, 
henceforth. The pity is that so few of them stay twelve 
years in the public school. But this fault is mending, 
day by day. 
So, on the moral issue, we are doing well. We need 
to do as well on the religious. The reason we have 
failed to do so, thus far, is because of our narrowness 
hot to say bigotry, to be frank about it. We are so 
Sure that we are right and that all others must be wrong
-P-A-G-E-328
320 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
in matters of religion, that we are uncharitable, and not 
infrequently unjust; sometimes overbearing, and occa- 
sionally tyrannical. It is not pleasant to say this, but 
let the truth be told. 
And it is because of these things, which all religious 
sects, and those who claim to be not religious at all, are 
more or less guilty of, that we get into trouble. If we 
were not all so anxious to proselyte, and to compel 
everybody to come our way, we should get along well 
enough. If we were as willing to allow our brothers 
and sisters under the flag religious liberty in our schools 
as great as the political freedom that we give them in 
the state, there would be very little cause for complaint. 
No teacher ever asks whether a child is of democratic, 
republican, or mugwump parentage. No teacher would 
be permitted to teach the tenets of any special political 
party in school. But this does not bar the teaching of 
Patriotism, of devotion to the flag, and of love for what 
it stands for. 
Now can we not be equally broad-minded and fair in 
the realm of religion? There are certain basic princi- 
ples that are common to all religions, just as there are 
certain patriotic elements that all political parties hold 
in common. Why not unite on these, and teach them 
to our children, and then let them differentiate on the 
holdings of sects, isms, and doxies, later on? 
What are these items in common, religiously speak- 
ing? some one asks. All I can do is to answer as it 
seems to me, which I am glad to do, to the best of my 
ability. 
I think that a love of righteousness, and an honest 
attempt to attain it, in all the affairs of life, pretty nearly 
covers the whole ground. Surely there is no form of
-P-A-G-E-329
MORALS AND RELIGION 322 
religion which ought not to include at least so much; 
and, given this, with all it implies, we have a good 
foundation for anything special, or particular, that may 
be added to it, in any or all religions. All the religious 
teachers that I know anything about agree on this; and 
if we could bring all the children of all the people to 
love it, and lead them to strive, with all their might, to 
attain to this standard, I am sure we should have a 
citizenship that would get along pretty well, religiously 
and all other ways, come what might. 
My notion is, then, that we can teach at least so 
much of religion in our public schools, with good results 
for all, and with bad results to none. And with this.as 
a basis, let the various sects build thereon, as they can, 
or may. 
What do I mean by righteousness? The word speaks 
for itself. There is a right and a wrong to everything in 
this world, and righteousness means an alliance with the 
first, in thought, and word, and deed; and a rejection of 
the last, continually. So far as meaning is concerned, 
it is really a very simple proposition. Practically con- 
sidered, it may not always be an easy matter to deter- 
Mine, in every case, and at first hand, just what the 
tight is; but to constantly inculcate a desire to “know 
the truth” and to act in accordance with its dictates, 
Must make for the formation of character that will 
Produce a most excellent foundation for religion of any 
and every sort. 
I once saw an old arithmetic whose preface closed 
with these words: “And now I commend you to him 
who maketh all things by number.” Good! I wish I 
Could have studied arithmetic with the man who made 
that book. I am sure he taught righteousness to his 
Y

pupils, and begot in them a love of the Author of Al\ 
Truth. When I studied arithmetic, the chief thing I 
_ was taught was how to find the answer. No effort was 
made to show me what it was all about — the real mark 
I was, or should have been, shooting at all the time. 
: That is a great phrase, “ maketh all things by number.” 
There is a basic religion in it from start to finish. A 
realization of what it means will beget reverence and 
awe and love and true regard for Him Who maketh all 
things thus. As the children grow in years, I believe 
most of them -——all of them who vibrate in that plane — 
can be led to see this through the means of their arith- 
metical work, and so can be brought into those ways of 
true religious experience and practice that are derived 
from this source. Let them learn that all that the most 
powerful telescope can reveal, all that the most highly 
magnifying microscope brings to light, and all in between, 
and all beyond, either way —~-that everything, everywhere, 
that we know anything about, is “made by number,” 
perfectly in order, truthful, righteous, without variable- 
ness or shadow of turning. Is there any doubt but 
that the making of such true wisdom a part of the lives 
of our school children will make them better men and 
women, better citizens, more anxious to bring their own 
acts within the laws.of righteousness, and so within the 
realm of true religion? And can such religious teaching 
do violence to the doctrines of any sect in all the world? 
There can be but one answer to this question. 
Horace Mann used to say that we want to rear “ gen- 
erations of men and women who are above deciding 
great and eternal principles upon low and _ selfish 
grounds.” Will not such teaching of arithmetic as I 
have suggested tend to produce such a result?
-P-A-G-E-331
MORALS AND RELIGION _ 323 
And what is true of arithmetic is equally true of any 
and all studies that have a place in the public school. 
A child can be led to see the eternal order of things on 
the earth by the study of geography — things regarding 
the physical construction of the world and its political 
divisions and arrangements. (How such a view of this 
study surpasses a mere memory knowledge of mountains, 
rivers, states, and their capitals, merely as such.) His- 
tory can be made to teach the pupil the devious ways of 
humanity in its upward struggle towards life and light. 
(How much more this is than the memorizing of stories 
of battles and the dates on which they were fought.) 
The study of language and its use, of literature, — of 
both these, present or past, so long as there is life in 
what the pupils work on,—of all the sciences, of the 
arts and trades,— all these studies can be so conducted 
as to impress the spirit of truth and righteousness upon 
the student, practically upon all the children of all the 
people in all our schools. Is this not a consummation 
devoutly to be wished ? 
Does this mean the Bible in our public schools? some 
one may ask. It may, or it may not. It all depends. 
If the Bible can be used in any school to furnish the 
growth and upbuilding of unsectarian religion, well and 
good. But not otherwise. And right there is some- 
thing for all fair-minded citizens of the United States to 
Stop to think about. What we must all keep in mind is 
that these schools are for all the children of all the peo- 
ple. All of the people pay for them, and all must have 
“a square deal” in everything that pertains to them, re- 
ligion as well as in everything else. 
And it is not a square deal to take advantage of a sit- 
uation, and endeavor to make our schools proselyting
-P-A-G-E-332
324 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
religious institutions, just because there is a majority 
in them one way or another. Our public schools are 
neither Protestant institutions nor Catholic institutions, 
nor are they sectarian institutions of any kind or sort. 
Indeed, much as some people would dislike to have it 
said, it cannot be justly claimed that our schools are 
even Christian institutions, in the sectarian use of that 
word. They are neither Christian, Jew, nor Gentile, 
Mohammedan, nor Buddhistic. They exploit the in- 
terests of no religious denomination of any name or 
order. And yet, for all of this, they can be truly con- 
ducted on genuine religious lines. 
’ Yet how often have we seen our schools treated as if 
they were to be conducted on denominational and sec- 
tarian lines. And I am ashamed to say that the greater 
part of such treatment has, so far, been largely on one 
side. The truth is, it must be neither on one side nor 
the other. No sectarian teacher and no community has 
a right to exploit their peculiar tenets and beliefs in a 
public school. To do so is wrong, no matter who does it 
or how large a majority may be which backs up such 
doing. The very foundation of our Republic is based on 
the idea of religious freedom, total and absolute; and he 
is a traitor who would violate that principle whenever he 
found himself in a position where he could do so without 
immediate danger of being called down or found out. 
Shall the Bible be used in our schools then? Yes, if 
it can be used and not abused ; if it can be made to serve 
the growth of those things that are common to all re- 
ligions without producing prejudice against any. If it 
can be used for religion’s sake, and not for sectarian pur- 
poses, well and good. This is fair to all, it is unjust to 
none, and from this position it seems to me there can be
-P-A-G-E-333
MORALS AND RELIGION 325 
no appeal in the mind of any truly patriotic and genuinely 
religious citizen, no matter what his particular sect or 
creed may be. No citizen wishes to have his own chil- 
dren proselyted by any sect, in or out of public schools. 
By the same token let us be fair, and not try to do to 
others what we would not like to have others do to us 
and ours. That is a “square deal,” and nothing else is. 
It can truthfully be said that the Bible contains a 
‘great wealth of material that can be used in our public 
schools, as has been suggested. I know of no book 
in the world which has in it so much of spiritual truth 
that is of universal application to all classes and con- 
ditions of men, women, and children. But it is also 
true that, as the various sects have interpreted some 
parts of it, all sorts of isms and dogmas and creeds are 
evolved from its pages. And it is further true that the 
most of our teachers have some special sectarian bias 
(as it is natural they should have, and as there is not the 
least objection to their personally having), and hence, if 
they are left to read the Bible to their pupils as they 
choose, they are /ikely (very likely, as a matter of fact) 
to attempt to transmit their particular creed notions to 
their pupils, through the reading of this book. 
Which things being true, would it not be wise for 
Some good, sane, unprejudiced men and women, repre- 
senting all sects and denominations and religions of all 
Sorts, to get together and compile a book of religious 
teadings for our public schools which should embody 
the fundamental ideas and principles that are common 
to all forms of religious belief. There is plenty in 
the Bible to fill such a book, and there are numberless 
things to be found outside its pages that are well worthy 
of a place in such a volume. Why may not the
-P-A-G-E-334
326 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
National Educational Association take this matter up, 
and deal with it as the situation demands? Some insti: 
tution of wide-extended influence ought to do this work, 
‘and I know of none better suited to the purpose than 
the N.E.A, 
-: And this is a work that needs to be done. The 
charge is sometimes made that our schools lack the 
religious element, and sometimes that the religious in- 
struction given in them is sectarian. Neither of these 
charges should be longer possible. And yet, as things 
_Now:are, they can be brought with a considerable degree 
of truth. Let us make an end of such possibility and 
bring about a condition in which pure religion and un- 
defiled shall be taught in all our schools, and every 
semblance of sectarianism be banished from their doors. 
Nothing short of this will satisfy the religious needs of 
all the people. 
And what has been said of the religious readings in 
our schools ought to be said, with double emphasis, 
regarding the religious singing done in them. No 
denominational or sectarian singing books should be 
permitted.to be used in our public schools. No hymns 
that have a doctrinal or denominational bias should ever 
be forced upon all the children of all the people; that 
is, such hymns should have no place in any public 
schoolroom. There are plenty of deeply religious 
hymns, hymns that breathe the spirit of truth and - 
righteousness in their every word and line, hymns that 
all religious people can agree upon for our children 
to sing, and these should be brought within their reach. 
So let fit hymns be added to fit religious readings, and 
then, instead of the religious jungle that we are now 
floundering around in in our public schools, we shall
-P-A-G-E-335
MORALS AND RELIGION 327 
have a highway straight through the premises, one that 
all the children of all the people can travel in with 
profit and delight, singing songs of all-enfolding joy as 
they go. What patriotic citizen would ask them to 
march otherwise? 
What this nation needs above everything else is to 
be saturated through and through with a living reli- 
gious spirit; to be “fused with vital religious fire,” 
which shall enter into and become a part of every 
thought and word and deed of every citizen of our 
Republic. The place to implant such virtue is in our 
public schools. If we can do that, and do it there, all 
will be well. All the sects have their places. The 
churches are, and of right ought to be. Let them all 
grow and flourish, each after its own kind. For this 
also is ordained. But let not any of them or all of them 
attempt to proselyte children to its particular creed 
through the means of the public schools. Let these 
things be, and the problem of morals and religion in our 
Public schools will be solved.

2 Common sense is that faculty of the human make-up 
that insists that the truth is good enough, and that 
has a way of getting at the truth, regardless of prece- 
dent and conventionalities. 
True, precedent and conventionality lift up their 
voices and wail, and make a great outcry whenever com- 
mon sense gets at the truth regardless of them; but in 
spite of such groans and tears and prognostications of 
ill, this primary element of the general soul steadily pur- 
sues its way on and up. Sometimes it moves “with in- 
credible slowness, so that with the eye it is impossible 
to tell which way it is going,” as Caesar once remarked 
regarding the river Arar. Again, it reaches its goal like 
a thunderbolt, crushing and burning its way through 
everything in its path. Not death itself is more relent- 
less or remorseless in its working than is the common 
sense of the people, when it once gets started, in the 
establishment of a truth which it sees clearly is good 
enough. 
328
-P-A-G-E-337
THE COMMON SENSE OF IT ALL 329 
It took common sense more than two hundred years 
to come to the point where it determined to establish the 
truth about slavery in this country. But it made quick 
and awful work of it, once it got at it. And all the 
while precedent and conventionality were working over- 
time to prove to common sense that it was all wrong, 
and that the truth in the premises was not at all as repre- 
sented. But common sense insisted ; and common sense 
demonstrated the truth of its position, Truly, the voice 
of the people is the voice of God, if only the noise we 
hear be really the people’s voice. 
There are other instances in point that will readily 
recur to the reader without my noting them here. 
What I want to say is, that it is a most excellent plan 
to heed the voice of God before it gets so loud and 
terrible that it blasts and annihilates. 
It is in the hope of helping to unstop some of the 
deaf ears, and to open some of the blind eyes of prece- 
dent and conventionality, that these pages have been 
written. I know that both these ultra-conservative social 
forces are braced squarely against many, not to say 
Most, of the positions taken in this book. None the less, 
common sense insists that the truth is good enough, and 
I am perfectly willing to be brought to its bar for 
judgment on what I have written or said. I make no 
plea for partiality in my favor, nor need I ask that the 
Opposite side be treated with no favoritism. Itis simply 
a case of “ May the Lord judge betwixt us twain,” and 
such a bench is not open to the suggestions of special 
counsel. 
The one persistent position that common sense occu- 
Pies regarding the public schools is that they should 
educate all the children of all the people. If they will
-P-A-G-E-338
330. ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
do: this, the method by which they accomplish the end 
is of small moment. But by just so much as they fail 
to do this, by just so much will they be brought into 
judgment by the common sense of the people; and 
by just so much wil] all inefficient ways and means be 
swept out of the path, and others set up in their places. 
These things will come in peace if the right shall lead. 
“They will sweep in storm if they be denied.” Common 
sense believes it is better to have them come in peace 
than to deny them so long that they will be forced to 
sweep in storm in order to arrive. 
It is no fable that the issues which the last fifty years 
have precipitated upon this nation are the most momen- 
tous that any people has ever faced. Babel was 4 
decorous afternoon tea party compared with the poly- 
glot clamors that are coming up all over this land 
from voices whose origins are as diverse as the races of 
the earth, and whose shoutings are as varied as their 
self-interests are multitudinous. 
And all this is intensified by the intermingling, in 
every cry, of the issue of the distribution of the vast 
hoards of newborn wealth with which the establishment 
of machinery has deluged civilization since you and 
T came into this world. On this count, the cry is fast 
rising to a roar, and the voice of God is evidently to be 
heard therein, Common sense is insisting that the 
truth is good enough here, also; and it is searching 
diligently for ways and means by which all may come 
to their own, even if it has to disregard precedent and 
conventionality to compass such result. 
And, as of yore, these two conservative factors are 
doing their old work over again. They are largely blind 
and deaf to the real issue, and persistently declare that
-P-A-G-E-339
THE COMMON SENSE OF IT ALL 331 
what has been must be, though the heavens fall and 
“the public be damned.” They do not put it just that 
way, but it is the real spirit of their position. 
The wealth of the world has been augmented by a 
greater amount in the last half century than in any 
one thousand years of previous history. Men used to 
plow, or mine, for money. Now they exploit some 
enterprise that is based on machinery, or some of its 
adjuncts, stock it to the limit, and.a printing press does 
the rest. And the output of the press goes, for the 
most part, to the men who furnish the blank paper 
which an imprint turns to gold. Billions have been 
made in that way since you and I can remember, and 
the problem of what to do about it is still on. For the 
most part, these billions are in the hands of the téw who 
printed them, and the many are in a state of unrest | 
because of the situation. Common sense sees a truth in 
the premises, and it is beginning to talk aboutit, out loud. 
And back of all this is the independence of thought 
and spirit on the part of the masses, a new situation 
brought about by an era of scientific thinking, which 
has hardly yet reached its years of discretion. There is 
much of the bull-in-the-china-shop in the use of this new 
acquirement, by the rank and file; but that does not 
alter the facts in the case. Itisa situation and not a 
theory that confronts us; and we cannot shirk the 
dominating question, What are we going to do about it? 
The proletariat can no longer be hushed by an edict from 
the aristocracy. The day of such method is past, and 
we are not yet quite sure what is to take its place. 
Common sense insists that the truth is good enough. 
The hard thing is to find out how to realize upon its 
demands.
-P-A-G-E-340
332, ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
_. With such issues upon this nation, it is as clear as the 
“noonday sun that special effort must be made to meet 
- them, or ruin will be upon us. And inasmuch as the 
old method of “might makes right” can no longer be 
maintained by a government of the people, by the peo- 
ple, and for the people, it is thoroughly apparent that 
some way other than the old one must be utilized in 
. the emergency. It is equally certain that the only way 
left-is to so establish righteousness and justice in the 
hearts of all the people that they will stand squarely for 
the upholding of the truths which common sense insists 
are.good enough. Nothing short of this can save us 
long from disaster and shipwreck. 
_ And by no other means can righteousness and justice 
be so successfully established in the hearts of all the 
people as through the medium of the public schools. 
It is within the possibilities for these schools to be so 
conducted and utilized that they shall impart a love of 
righteousness and of justice to all the children of all the 
people ; shall disseminate among them a true spirit of 
mutualness, and breathe into them the breath of brotherly 
love and of genuine democracy, for use in all the affairs 
of life, both private and public. That is what these 
schools were established to do; and that they must do, 
or yield their place to some institution that can do what 
the situation demands. 
But if these schools do this, they must meet the 
needs of aff the children of a// the people, so that, 
when grown, these children, having become men and 
women, shall be equal to a satisfactory adjustment of 
the issues that are upon them. These schools can. never 
accomplish the purposes they were made to fulfill by 
devoting the major part of their energies and methods
-P-A-G-E-341
THE COMMON SENSE OF IT ALL 333 
to the special interest of a few of the children of a few 
of the people, o matter who or what these few may be. 
They can never do it by persisting in the use of obsolete 
ways and means which were primarily fashioned for 
the cloister of an old-time gentility. They can never 
do it by following a psychology that is based on the 
uniformity of the human mind, and on the possibility of 
environment fashioning every individuality to a common 
model, 
All these things have been weighed in the balance 
for the last fifty years, and common sense proclaims the 
fact that they have been found wanting in many re- 
spects. They should not be discarded, any or all of 
them, merely because they are old. Nothing.should be 
discarded merely because it is old. “Would the son 
discard the father?” Neither should they be retained 
merely because they are old. Things wear out in this 
world. They have their day, and when their day is 
done, they should move on. All that is good in them 
should be kept for the use of those who come after. 
All that has served its time should either be buried or 
hung up in a museum of antiquities. This is simple 
common sense, it is the truth, and the truth is good 
enough. 
Here, then, it seems to me, is the summing up of the 
whole matter. The situation demands of our public 
schools that they fit all of the children of all of the people 
for all of the duties of life for which God has given them 
power. For such work all of the people contribute a 
common fund which can rightfully be used only for the 
common good of all. There can be no pets, no selec- 
tions, no survivals of the so-called fittest at the expense 
of those whom a mere material philosophy would sacri-
-P-A-G-E-342
334 ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
fice simply because they are weak. These schools are 
under the spirit of the new law of love and mutualness, 
and. not under the letter of the old law of domination 
‘and the dictation of those who have the power of 
control. 
And the question for you and for me is, Will we put 
forth every effort to exploit these schools, as the situa- 
tion. demands? Will we be brave enough to look for- 
ward and upward, and to push on, even if it does cost 
us labor and struggle and worry and weariness? Will 
we be anxious that “not one of the least of these little 
ones shall perish”; or will we be indifferent, and say, 
“What is that to us, every man for himself, and the 
devil take the hindermost”? Will we be willing to fol- 
low a Mosés of common sense, up and on, to God; or 
will we beg of some Aaron to make us a calf out of the 
jewels of precedent and conventionality something 
that we may comfortably worship, and sit still where 
we are? Will we be genuinely democratic in this 
nation which we so proudly call the land of the free ; oF 
will we be aristocratic and monarchical in fact, while 
sitting under the protection of the Stars and Stripes? 
Brethren and sisters of every name and order, fellow 
citizens, teachers, fathers and mothers of this great Re- 
public, it is up tous! What are we going to do about 
it? Let’s do the right thing, the thing which common 
sense says is good enough. We will! 
I have faith to believe that the common sense of all 
our people will, one day, put our public schools into 
such shape that they will do all that is required of them; 
that they will take into account the way the children are, 
each one of them, and that they will so teach, train, and 
educate them, that they will, each one, fill to the full the
-P-A-G-E-343
THE COMMON SENSE OF IT ALL 335 
particular niche in our Republic which his or her own 
individuality is best fitted for. 
I know the way is largely untried, that the seas we 
have to sail are as yet, many of them, uncharted. But, 
none the less, we must sail them; for the goal of aédso- 
lute mutualness in education is also named, and tt cannot 
be countermanded. There is nothing left for us to do 
but to 
“Cut the hawsers — haul out — shake out every sail ! 
Steer for the deep waters only. 
For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go, 
And we will risk the ship, ourselves and all. . 
O daring joy, but safe! Are they not all the seas of God ? 
O farther, farther, farther, sail!” 
“Ts it a dream ? 
Nay, but the lack of it a dream! 
And, wanting this, life’s wealth and lore a dream, 
And all the world a dream!”

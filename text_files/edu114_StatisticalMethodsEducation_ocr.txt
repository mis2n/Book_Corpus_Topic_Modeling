  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Sucu a volume as the present number in this series of 
textbooks forms an interesting exhibit of the progress at 
present being made in the organization of instruction in the 
subject of education. Two decades ago there would have 
been almost no use for such a volume, as we had not then 
begun to make any accurate measures of the products of our 
educational efforts. Only the most general terms were then 
in use, while to-day the demand is for quantitative expres- 
sion in commonly used terms which students can under- 
stand. Especially within the past decade has there been a 
remarkable evolution of standards for educational work and 
quantitative units of measurement. To-day the educational 
investigator and the superintendent of instruction alike 
need to use refined tools in the measurement of educational 
results. To such, and to the students in our schools of edu- 
cation generally, the simple presentation of the mathematics 
underlying the accurate measurement and plotting of edu- 
cational results here presented should prove of large use- 
fulness. 
The author of this volume has stated the aims and pur- 
poses and plan of the work so well in his preface that little 
remains that an editor needs to say. The volume represents 
a very successful attempt to produce a book which will apply 
the mathematical theory of statistical work to educational 
problems, and as such it should find a hearty welcome from 
teachers of education in universities, colleges, and normal 
schools, educational investigators generally, and school offi- 
cers interested in making the best use of statistical data 
and displaying the results to their supporting public in the Cd. 2

  PREFACE 
Durine the past two decades a body of quantitative 
technique has developed in education which makes constant 
use of technical statistical methods. The school man, in 
trying to keep pace with the developing tools, has constantly 
demanded a complete exposition of them. At the same time 
he has made it very clear that the treatment which will 
appeal most pertinently to his needs must be couched in 
non-mathematical language. He has said frankly that his 
mathematical training has been limited to high-school alge- 
bra, and rather an ancient and, in some sense, obsolete al- 
gebra at that. He has told us that “graphs” are mysterious 
things to him; that equations of lines and formule have no 
significance; that the use of “frequency distributions,” 
“probability curves,’ “medians,” “measures of variabil- 
ity,” and “coefficients of correlation” can hardly be said to 
lend clearness to his thinking about his own school problems. 
Three courses are open to the writer who wishes to ac-. 
quaint such persons with statistical methods of treating facts. 
First, he can say that the school man’s lack of familiarity 
with college algebra, analytic geometry, the calculus, and 
least squares is his own lookout, and that it is impossible to 
write a “statistical methods” and to give statistical training 
without presupposing this particular kind of equipment. 
We have available now several books and many mono- 
graphs built on that basis which make use, more or less in 
detail, of the higher mathematics, but none of which are 
applied to educational problems. 
Second, he can give the student of education a manual of 
formule and rule-of-thumb methods of computing the vari-_
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii PREFACE 
ous coefficients, without any explanation of the derivation 
of these constants, without an adequate exposition of how 
to discriminate the use of the different methods, and with- 
out making possible a complete and proper interpretation of 
the results of using the methods. To do this would commit 
the writer to the rather current theory that, for the educa- 
tionist, ‘statistics is arithmetic,” and that his statistical 
equipment should include only the ability to compute the 
various coefficients and to follow rule-of-thumb methods of 
interpreting them (¢.g., the rule that a coefficient of correla- 
tion of say .26 is “high,” “low,” or “what-not”). The few 
books and chapters of books which have so far applied sta- 
tistical methods to school problems have been very largely 
committed to this doctrine. = 
Third, the writer in this field can assume that it is neces- 
sary to equip school men, generally, with a thorough-going 
knowledge of statistical methods; that in order for them 
to be discriminating in the use of the various methods in 
improving their school practice, this large background of 
knowledge must be developed; and that it is possible to ex- 
plain rather completely the reasons for and the significance 
of the principal statistical devices without expressing the 
explanation in technical mathematical language. 
This book has been written with a deep-rooted conviction 
that the third of these three courses is the proper one; with 
a complete recognition of the limitations in mathematical 
equipment of the “average” school administrator and 
teacher, which is the outcome of considerable classroom con- 
tact with this particular kind of student. It is based upon 
the knowledge, however, that it is possible to make clear 
the significance and proper use of the more important sta- 
tistical devices without expressing these in mathematical 
form. 
The necessary substitution of words for symbols in the
-P-A-G-E-9
  PREFACE ix 
explanation of the derivation and common-sense significance 
of such devices has resulted in what, to the mathematically 
trained reader, will seem to be a “wordy” book. The pre- 
rogative of the “author’s preface” leads the present writer 
to say frankly that in this book he has not been interested 
in writing for the mathematically equipped reader. At the 
same time, it is hoped that such a person can, indeed, get an 
initial view of statistical methods from the following chap- 
ters which he can use to advantage in a study of the second- 
ary and original works of Yule, Bowley, Elderton, Karl 
Pearson, and others who have constructed our statistical 
tools. 
The book throughout has been written in intimate contact 
with graduate classes in education. It is the direct out- 
growth of mimeographed notes written for seven of such 
classes, and elaborated and revised distinctly in terms of 
their specific needs and interests. Symbolic and word ex- 
planations have given way to graphic devices wherever 
necessary and possible. The many repetitional “back refer- 
ences,” restatements of principles, reasons, etc., in succeed- 
ing chapters have been made with a full recognition of the 
possible inelegance in form, but with a firm conviction in the 
value of the resulting increase in clearness to the reader. 
Traditional usage in the form of textbook writing has been 
deliberately sacrificed to the one criterion of readableness. 
A very small group of students. of education have made 
use, recently, of certain methods which have not been in- 
cluded in the discussion of this book. Outstanding among 
these is Yule’s Partial Correlation, and Spearman’s methods 
of “correcting” coefficients of correlation. To a very small 
group of educational psychologists these may seem unpar- 
donable omissions. However, neither set of methods could 
have been presented in the complete fashion necessary in the 
treatment of those topics without encroaching unduly upon
-P-A-G-E-10
   
           
   x PREFACE 
  the limited space of this textbook, already devoted to more 
important methods. Furthermore, it is doubtful if the for- 
mer of these methods will be used by more than a very small 
fraction of those working in educational research in our own 
generation. These persons should turn to Yule’s complete 
original discussion. In regard to the latter of the two sets of 
methods, the writer is one of those who are still skeptical of 
the use of methods of “correcting” coefficients (the validity 
of which has not been established) which have been com- 
puted from material collected under conditions subject to 
such gross inaccuracies as are the conditions of educational 
research. 
It is fundamental to a clear comprehension of the writer’s 
point of view to know that this book is based upon the doc- 
trine that statistical methods in themselves prove nothing, 
— that the methods selected for use in a particular situation 
must agree with the logic of that situation: in a word, that 
statistical methods are merely quantitative devices which 
we can use to refine our thinking about complex masses of 
data, and to refine our methods of expression. 
The example of Leonard P. Ayres in his discriminating 
use of statistical methods in school research, and his con- 
stant subordination of the exhibition of statistical form to 
clearness and simplicity of presentation, has been a potent 
factor in determining the writer’s point of view, and has 
wrought a definite effect upon his practice.

  CHAPTER I 
THE USE OF STATISTICAL METHODS IN EDUCATION 
       
       Propiems AND Meruops In Scuoon REsmaRcH 
Steps in the development of “scientific education.” 
There are two groups of persons in the educational world 
who are directly interested in the application of statistical 
methods to school problems — the school administrator, 
and the teacher and educational psychologist. In corre- 
spondence to these two classes of interest, school problems 
may be said to be either administrative or pedagogical-ex- 
perimental in character. They arise either in connection 
with the attempt of the administrative agents of a school 
system to fit the “machinery of the system”’ to the needs and 
capacities of children, or to the attempt of the school man 
and the psychologist, working together, to determine more 
minutely the status of learning in the child. The school 
man’s chief concern, then, is with these questions: First, 
how does the child learn? Second, how may the course of 
study, methods of teaching, modes of classifying and pro- 
moting children, methods of organizing the school year, 
safe-guarding the health of school children, etc., be best 
adapted to the established facts of development and proc- 
esses of learning in children, and to the needs of their 
future life. 
The method of attacking the solution of such fundamental              
                                  
-P-A-G-E-20
    
   2 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  questions prior to our own generation was clearly tradi- 
tional and based on individual experience. It was said by 
the representatives of the established sciences, and freely ® 
admitted by the pedagogues, that “education” was not 
a “science’’ — that its method was not “scientific.” By 
this was meant that school men did not make use of the 
fundamental steps in the scientific procedure of solving 
problems. 
Fundamental steps neglected. To be specific: (1) They 
did not systematically observe educational conditions, or 
collect necessary facts, recording their observations mi- 
nutely. More concretely this meant that they did not set 
about collecting the facts on the composition, training, 
certification, tenure, pay, and rating of the teaching staff; 
the content of courses of study; the age-grade djstribution 
of pupils, and their progress through the grades; the cor- 
responding measurement of instruction and the capacities of 
pupils; the extent of their elimination from and retardation 
in the public schools; the many facts concerning the central 
administration and organization of schools; school costs, 
school accounting, and the efficiency of business manage- 
ment; operation of the plant and the handling of equipment 
and supplies, — the determination of each of which is neces- 
sary to the promotion of efficient school administration. 
Thus, the first step in the utilization of the scientific method 
— the collection of large numbers of facts — was not taken. 
(2) The indictment of our traditional pedagogy pointed 
out that students of “pedagogy” did not “measure”’ the 
results of school work, that no yardsticks were available 
by which the efficiency of school administration or school 
teaching could be evaluated; hence that little progress in 
the improvement of either one could come about. Nobody 
knew accurately to what extent boys and girls had mas- 
tered the elements of reading, writing, arithmetic, spelling,      
   
-P-A-G-E-21
       USE OF STATISTICAL METHODS 3 
geography, history, and language. We simply knew that 
there was an accumulation of incapacity in particular 
grades of the public schools, relieved in part by rapid elim- 
ination of pupils from school. 
(8) In pedagogy, however, it was evident that since almost 
no collection of facts was made that no recourse was had to 
the development of mathematical or statistical methods 
of treating the data. Large quantities of data accumulat- 
ing in the biological and physical sciences had demanded and 
led to the development of sound methods of statistical 
treatment in those fields. Prior to fifteen years ago “ peda- 
gogy,”’ however, had made no use of the large body of sta- 
tistical technique that had been put together. 
(4) “Science” demands as the capstone of its procedure 
the utilization of a thoroughgoing experimental attack on 
the problem in question. Conditions must be “controlled” 
by the investigator, measurements must be made as mi- 
nutely as possible, records of results must be kept, and the 
data which have been collected must be systematically 
organized through the utilization of valid statistical methods. 
Again, prior to our generation, this experimental procedure 
had not been used in education. It is true that four dec- 
ades ago various German psychologists began the study of 
“learning” under isolated conditions, and with fairly refined 
laboratory technique planned a way for the transfer of their 
technique and certain of their grosser conclusions to class- 
room analysis of learning and teaching. This actual trans- 
fer, however, has come about in our own time. 
Lack of thorough collection of facts concerning educa- 
tional conditions, measurement of results, statistical treat- 
ment of the data, setting up of experimental methods of 
studying school practice, — these are the counts on which 
the older ‘“‘ pedagogy” was indicted. 
Recent developments. The above statement of the ways

           4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
   in which pedagogy failed to utilize scientific method reveals 
specifically the steps in the development of “scientific edu- 
cation” during the past two decades, and leads naturally 
to an exposition of the use of statistical methods to school 
men. The school man has turned to exactly these steps of 
procedure in the attempt to determine the present status 
of school practice and to direct scientifically the course of its 
development. 
We have said above that school problems were either 
administrative or pedagogical-experimental in character. 
Our first task in taking up the study of “statistical methods 
applied to educational problems” is to recognize clearly 
. the various school problems whose solution demands treat- 
ment by numerical methods. During the past fifteen years 
every phase of school administration and pedagogy has 
been subjected to quantitative methods of study and ex- 
perimentation. Our educational literature abounds with 
“factual” studies, our educational conventions are given 
over very largely to discussions of “measurement” and 
“standardization” of school processes. Outstanding at the 
present time, therefore, is the need for a clear, scientific, and 
complete statement of the statistical and graphic methods 
which the school man must call to his aid in this quantita- 
tive attack on educational problems. 
To get sharply before us a picture of the new emphasis, 
let us turn briefly to a few examples of the use of statistical 
methods in education. These have been so selected that 
the general field will be brought in review.

    the new movement. The tabulation and classification of the 
results of testing has led to the development of devices for 
recording school facts and for presenting the data. The need 
for tabular and statistical methods is well illustrated by the 
following quotation from Brown.*

Note the use of statistical 
methods. (S. A. Courtis, 
1917.) They should be given special quick percep- 
tion practice daily to bring their rate of 
reading up to a higher standard. There are 
ten pupils whose comprehension falls con- 
siderably below the average of the class, four 
of whom fall conspicuously low and can 
easily be identified in Diagram 2. They need 
special practice in rapid silent reading with 
special emphasis upon getting a maximum 
of content from what is read. The four who 
get the lowest marks in comprehension are 
seen on Fig. 8 to have a very low score for 
reading efficiency. 
We may now examine a number of indi- 
vidual cases. It is easy to see that Pupil 
No. 1 is deficient in the rate at which he can 
read. He gets a relatively large proportion 
of the content at his present rate of reading, 
but he reads so little in a unit of time that 
his efficiency is low. He should have practice 
to increase his speed, and if it is found that 
at a higher rate of reading his comprehension 
is poor, he should be given practice for the 
purpose of bringing about improvement 
along this line also. Pupil No. 2 has a dif- 
ficulty which is easy to diagnose. In the 
first place his rate of reading is not suffi- 
ciently rapid, but on quantity of reproduc- 
tion he stands high. His mark for quality, 
on the other hand, falls to zero. In other 
words, he gets a good many ideas in the 
rough but gets nothing accurately. We see 
in the case of this pupil one advantage of 
the method of scoring reading ability advo- 
cated in this bulletin. It enables us to find   
more correctly the exact location of defects in the reading ability 
of individual children. What this pupil gets is a mere smattering of 
the idea. His low mark for comprehension, together with his low

   USE OF STATISTICAL METHODS 9 
       
      
   
      
   rate of reading, gives him a low efficiency. He needs to work both 
for speed and for accuracy. Pupil No. 4 reads at a rate consider- 
ably below the average. He gets, in a rather rough way, a very large 
percentage of the ideas, but he is very inaccurate. 
   Mr. Brown’s material illustrates the use of averages, 
measures of variability and graphic methods for diagnosing 
weaknesses in school work. 
   
    
                                   
                    
    
      2. Scientific supervision of arithmetic 
This type of statistical device may be supplemented by 
some of Mr. Courtis’s recording devices in the improvement 
of teaching in arithmetic. Diagram $ gives a simple chart 
for tabulating the number of pupils attempting various 
numbers of problems, the number of pupils working va- 
rious numbers of these correctly, the approximate median, 
(Ap. Med.); the correction (cor.); the true median (Med.); 
the mean deviation (M.D.) and the accuracy. 
Diagram 4 presents Courtis’s “Diagnostic Curve of Me- 
dian Development in Speed and Accuracy”’ in arithmetic, 
the use of which is explained in the following quotation: — 
In Diagram 4 are drawn curves for two school systems. Curve 
A is for a small village school in New Hampshire. Curve B again 
represents the scores made by the group of 29 school districts in 
Boston which have been tested every year since 1912. 
The work in school A is very poor. Grade four falls entirely out- 
side the diagram. Grades five and six in speed nearly equal the 
fourth- and fifth-grade standards, respectively, but in accuracy are 
way below the normal fourth-grade level. From the sixth grade on, 
the effect of school work is to emphasize accuracy, so that while the 
seventh and eighth grades approach more nearly the normal curve,1 
  
1 Mr. Courtis’s use of “normal curve” in this connection should not be 
confused with the standard practice of reserving that term for the so-called 
“curve of error,” the “normal probability curve,” etc. There is great 
need for uniformity in practice in our statistical terminology. Such terms 
as “normal curve” have really become standard in our thinking and their 
specificness of meaning should not be clouded by multiplying terms.
-P-A-G-E-28
       
   10 STATISTICAL METHODS    
the increased accuracy is obtained at the expense of speed. The 
eighth-grade scores are lower than those of the seventh grade, 
and none of the scores reach the normal fifth-grade level. Curves of 
this character are evidences of lack of supervision, of poor, inef- 
fective teaching, and are far too common in country schools. 
Curve B, on the other hand, indicates good quality of work and 
steady progress. Note that the curve lies wholly above the normal

curve, and that each grade circle shows not only greater accuracy 
than normal, but greater speed as well. Note also that the largest 
growth occurs between the fifth and sixth grades, the second largest 
between the seventh and eighth grades. The curves of the schools 
doing the best work tend, in similar fashion, to approximate the 
80% line in addition, although few attain to as high speed levels 
as those shown in curve B. 
3. Studies of failures in the public schools 
One of the most important types of administrative study 
that can be made of a school system is a study of the failures 
of its pupils in the different grades and different subjects. 
Somewhat recently these problems of non-promotion have

been studied analytically, to the great benefit of the schools 
in question. A practical graphic device for revealing lack

adopting simple quantitative and graphic methods of ac-

  Diacram 9. Mean Costs or Hicu-Scuoon Supsmcrs 
“The variety of prices paid for the same quantity of instruction in the various subjects 
is shown. The subject of median cost stands at $62. The middle zone of variability shows a 
range from $55 to $70. For those that now stand above this zone of ‘normal variability’ it is 
possible that administrative readjustments are desirable for the purpose of bringing them 
down, and thus eliminating waste. For those below this normal range of variability classes 
need to be cut down in size, teachers better paid, or the teaching week shortened, so as to 
bring them at least nearer the range of normality. In other words, just as it is possible to de- 
termine standard costs for each of the various subjects separately, out of the practical situa- 
tions where those subjects are taught, so it may be possible to determine flexibility standards 
of cost for the entire situation applicable to the entire range of subjects. Whether or not this 
can be profitable can be known only after such standards have been derived for high schools 
of homogeneous classes, and involving large numbers. After the matter has been tried out its 
worth can be known.” (F. Babbitt, 1916.) 
limits of the middle 50 per cent. In time past the arithmetical mean 
or average has been used for this purpose, and it still has its value. 
Nevertheless its disadvantages, especially that of the undue weight

      16 STATISTICAL METHODS 
   exercised by a number which is very large or very small as com- 
pared with the others in the series, are causing the increased use 
of the median wherever practicable. 
The second feature of the general method of treatment is the 
“ranking” of the various amounts in each column by groups. The 
“rank” of an item is its place in the series, as arranged for the 
determination of the median and the middle 50 per cent, as just 
described, the item lowest in value being given rank 1, the next to 
the lowest rank 2, and so on. In other words, the ‘‘ranks” are the 
result of the process of the numbering of the series, which neces- 
sarily precedes the determination of the median and the middle 
50 per cent. No element of comparative worth is attached to the 
numbers given. In some items, as in fuel, it is creditable to a city 
to have a low number; in others, a high number. The purpose for 
the insertion of the columns entitled “rank” in the tables is merely 
to facilitate the comparison of items. 
As an illustration of his use of the method, we may 
quote: — 
       Comparison of distribution of expenses in one city with distribu- 
tion of expenses in other cities of the same group. This may be 
done in a cursory manner by extending the process just indicated 
to all items, and forming a rough judgment as to the items in which 
the city is low or high as compared with the group as a whole. The 
more accurate method consists in computing the differences between 
the percentages of the various classes of eapenses for the city and the 
corresponding medians, and arranging the excesses and deficiencies in 
separate lists. As those items that vary most from the medians are 
of greatest importance, and as variation from the median to the 
extent of the limits of the middle 50 per cent may be regarded as 
normal, the computation of differences in cases wherein the city’s 
percentage is within the limits of the middle 50 per cent may be 
for all practical purposes neglected. The following diagram (10), 
presents the result of such a computation for the city of Washing- 
ton. 
7. Use of the “normal curve” in designing school tests 
In attempting to improve the marking of pupils and the 
planning of school tests, much recourse is had now to the
-P-A-G-E-35
  USE OF STATISTICAL METHODS 17 
normal probability curve. One example can be given from 
the writer’s discussion of standardized tests in algebra.* 
A more complete quotation from this study is given in 
Chapter VIII. This briefer one will serve to illustrate the 
method: —

(HL. Updegraff, 1912.) 
Let Diagram 11 represent the distribution of algebraic abilities 
in the pupils represented by our 27 school systems. The base line 
then represents a “‘scale of algebraic difficulty” ranging, let us say, 
from nearly 0 ability to nearly perfect or 100 per cent ability. . . . 
Taking as our unit of measurement on the base line, sigma, 7, or 
the “standard deviation” of the distribution (indicated graphically 
on Diagram 11), and laying it off 2.5 times each way from the mid- 
point of the curve, gives us 5 divisions (which may be conveniently 
divided into 10 divisions, corresponding “practically” to our 
public-school marking system). In doing this we are arbitrary to 
the extent of neglecting only 0.62 of 1 per cent of our pupils at 
each end of the base line. ‘If this 0.62 of 1 per cent is thrown into 
the middle of the curve where the individuals are more closely 
grouped, it is a negligible factor. Calling the point 2.5 x sigma

from the mid-point 0, and setting the successive points 10, 20, 30, 
etc., to 100, we now have a practical working “scale of algebraic 
difficulty” over the successive points of which the corresponding 
percentages of our pupils may be indicated. Doing this, we see in

problems. 0 and 100 points set arbitrarily at 2.5Xo from the mean. Mean is set arbitrarily 
at 50. Area of the curve between 0 and any point on base line represents percentage of pupils 
who failed the problem placed at that point. (H. O. Rugg, 1917.) 
Diagram 11 the proportions of our group of pupils that correspond 
to various degrees of difficulty on the base line. Thus a problem 
which is failed by 96.6 per cent of the group falls at the point marked 
85; that failed by 84.8 per cent is scored 70, etc., throughout the list. 
To enable us to mark in an accurate way, a table has been com- 
puted in which the base line has been divided into 500 parts.

The study of the distribution of general intelligence in 
pupils in our public schools is likewise making use of quanti- 
tative methods. Terman! points out the symmetry of the 
plotted results of testing the intelligence of 905 school chil- 
dren, as follows: —

cluding in order the I Q’s from 106 to 115, 116 to 125, ete.; cor- 
respondingly with the descending groups. Figure 12 shows the dis- 
tribution found by this grouping for the 905 children of ages 5 to 
14 combined. The subjects above 14 are not included in this curve 
because they are left-overs and not representative of their ages. 
The distribution for the ages combined is seen to be remarkably 
symmetrical. The symmetry for the separate ages was hardly less 
marked, considering that only 80 to 120 children were tested at each 
age. In fact, the range, including the middle 50 per cent of I Q’s, 
was found practically constant from 5 to 14 years. The tendency 
is for the middle 50 per cent to fall (approximately) between 93 
and 108.

Table 2 illustrates a form of procedure which is necessary, in 
many cases, to obtain a reliable calculation of correlation, that is, 
the determination first of the reliability of the measures secured 
in each test by itself. This is secured by finding the correlation

Mifflin Company. 1916.)

  USE OF STATISTICAL METHODS 21 
between the two performances in the same test, using, where the 
nature of the test demands it, different subject-matter in the two 
performances. If this correlation is not fairly high — above .60 — 
the degree of correlation between this test and others is of little 
significance, since the scores are not accurate measures of the 
ability in question. A formula has been developed by Spearman 
to correct a coefficient of correlation when it is reduced by lack of 
precision in the results in the individual tests, but the reliability 
of this formula is doubtful, and it is far better to perfect the methods 
of giving-the test until their results are consistent. In the case 
before us two series of opposites were used with the same persons. 
The correlation between them appears from the table to be satis- 
factory (r = 65.8), though it might well be higher. 
Use of quantitative methods. The foregoing quotations 
offer but a crude and inadequate picture of the extent to 
which students of education are making use of quantita- 
tive methods in attempting to solve their administrative 
and pedagogical problems. They merely serve to illustrate 
the principal statistical and graphical methods which will 
be taken up in the succeeding chapters. It is felt, however, 
that there is a need for a more complete organization of the 
“field of educational research”’ than as yet has been made. 
Many quantitative studies have appeared in each of the 
various phases of scientific education. The student is baf- 
fled by a maze of scattered material. To aid him in organ- 
izing his thinking, by cataloguing the various educational 
problems and the methods by which school men are trying 
to solve them, Plate I is included in Chapter X. On this 
plate the writer has attempted to give definite reference to 
all the studies that are of any importance to school men. 
The chart is so built as to indicate two important charac- 
teristics; it states: (1) who has studied each of the various 
problems; and (2) by what methods these persons have 
attempted to solve these problems. The key number at- 
tached to each name refers to the position in the complete

bibliography given at the end of Chapter X. It will be 
noted that no attempt has been made to include the studies 
in the field of educational psychology. To give the student 
the key to this field, selected references containing complete 
bibliographies are given. 
Il. Taz More Important Groups or Scuoot PropLtems 
In summarizing the discussion of this chapter let us bring 
in review a brief statement of each of the more important 
groups of school problems. To enumerate them we find: — 
1. Administrative problems 
Study of the curriculum. There have been concerted at- 
tempts to establish minimum essentials in the course of 
study in our schools, — question-blanks have been sent out 
covering various phases of the content of the curriculum; 
textbooks have been analyzed in a tabular way; judgments 
of specialists have been secured concerning the proper 
organization of subject-matter; industrial, economic, and 
social conditions in various types of communities have been 
studied with a view to adapting school practice to them. 
Facts about the teaching staff. By means of question- 
blank methods and personal investigation of state school 
laws, city school-board by-laws, manuals, rules, and records, 
and Federal, state, and city school reports, — quantitative 
facts have been collected about the teacher: who she is, what 
home environment she came from, how much training and 
experience she has had; facts about her appointment, cer- 
tification, salary, progress in the teaching profession, and 
her classroom efficiency. 
Problems centering about the pupil. Personal study of 
individual systems, supplemented by the question-blank, 
has been used by private and public agencies to ascertain
-P-A-G-E-41
  USE OF STATISTICAL METHODS 23 
the status of pupils in our schools; in what way they are 
distributed through the elementary and secondary grades, 
according to relative ages; non-promotions and rates of 
progress through the grades; how pupils are eliminated 
from school; administrative devices (“promotion systems” 
or “plans’’) for adapting the machinery of the school system 
to the capacities, needs, and interests of the child; method 
of “marking” the pupils’ achievement. 
Status of school finance. Recently school costs and busi- 
ness management have been studied in this same quanti- 
tative way. Originally by question-blank, but mainly by 
individual investigation of school laws, charters, and rec- 
ords, specialists are establishing the legal basis of school 
finance, the status of city and state school revenues and 
expenditures, unit costs for education, methods of raising 
and apportioning school funds, and the efficiency of the 
business management of our city schools. 
Measurement of school and teaching efficiency. During 
the last seven years the school world has at last turned to 
the construction and use of tests and “scales” to measure 
the results of teaching. Accompanying the attempt to study 
the content of the curriculum, to clarify and make definite 
the aims and outcomes of teaching, there has developed 
a most promising and important movement of educational 
measurement. In answer to the critics of the “older peda- 
gogy”’ the newer and more scientific “‘educationist”’ is de- 
vising and using tests to measure the results of teaching in 
practically all of the “skill” or ‘‘formal” subjects. There 
are now available six handwriting “scales,” of varying de- 
grees of usefulness to classroom work; as many standard- 
ized reading tests; many discussions of measuring spell- 
ing “ability”; a fairly large and definite body of results in. 
testing arithmetical abilities, some extensive work in the 
field of algebra tests, — with little or nothing done in the
-P-A-G-E-42
  24 STATISTICAL METHODS 
remaining subjects. Accompanying this material, we now 
have a growing body of critical data on the validity of such 
tests. 
Furthermore, during the past five years more than fifty 
American school systems have been “surveyed” by groups 
of outside specialists — men who came into the systems in 
question and collected, by detailed personal investigation 
from the officers, teachers, and records of the system itself, 
sufficient facts to adequately typify the practice of educa- 
tion in that city. “School measurement” has seen its most 
thorough-going development in this school-survey move- 
ment. 
Problems of central organization and administration. 
Even the board of education in American cities has been 
subjected to the same type of quantitative study. Its pres- 
ent status as to size, qualifications for membership, tenure, 
compensation, and methods of selecting board members; 
their functions, powers, and duties, and the way they carry 
on their business, have been numerically determined by 
both question-blank analysis and by personal study of the 
charters, by-laws, rules, and records of city school systems. 
Miscellaneous educational activities. In the same fashion, 
various miscellaneous educational activities have been can- 
vassed in a tabular way, — problems of school hygiene, medi- 
cal inspection, rearrangements of the school year, etc. 
All of the above types of problems are administrative in 
character. In each of them we have noted the recurrence 
of the fundamental initial methods of statistical inquiry, — 
the collection of educational data by either (1) question- 
blank; or (2) some method of personal investigation. ‘These 
will be discussed definitely in Chapter II. 
In addition to these outstanding administrative “prob- 
lems,’ we must bring into our perspective of the “field of 
educational research” a statement of the more important,
-P-A-G-E-43
  USE OF STATISTICAL METHODS 25 
experimental problems of learning and teaching. For our 
purposes a brief enumeration of the principal types of study 
will have to suffice. 
2. Pedagogical-Experimental problems 
Problems of “learning” were first studied in a controlled 
way under isolated conditions in the psychological labo- 
ratory three decades ago. The names of the leaders of va- 
rious German schools, Ebbinghaus, Meumann, Kraepelin, 
Lay, etc., are linked up, literally, with scores of specific 
quantitative studies of isolated learning. These may be 
listed under the following points: — 
Studies of the ‘‘ practice ” or ‘‘ learning” curve. Data 
were collected and interpreted on the improvement of sub- 
jects in doing a particular mental act (¢.g., memorizing se- 
ries of nonsense syllables); facts were collected on the rate of 
improvement, the amount of improvement, the limit of 
improvement, the mental qualities that conditioned im- 
provement, changes in the rate and the permanence of im- 
provement. Each of the studies involved the use of many 
quantitative methods. During the past fifteen years these 
studies have come out rapidly from American laboratories, 
and gradually have been extended to include specific types 
of mental work done in the class room. 
Formal discipline. Since James suggested the use of quan- 
titative methods in studying the possibilities in formal dis- 
cipline in 1890, thirty-odd reports have been made on the 
influence of training in one field of mental activity on per- 
formance in another field of mental activity. The old tra- 
ditional a priori method of controversial discussion has 
given way to an experimental and statistical attempt to es-

Fatigue,” “Mental Work,” and “Mental Types,” see Thorndike’s Educa- 
tional Psychology, vol. u, entitled The Psychology of Learning.

  26 STATISTICAL METHODS 
tablish scientifically the status of the possibility of “trans- 
ference of training.” ! 
Mental work and fatigue. . In the same way the condition- 
ing factors of “mental fatigue” and “ mental work” have 
been tested under controlled experimental conditions, and 
a fairly large body of data collected. 
General intelligence and mental inheritance. A very 
voluminous literature is already available giving the results 
of the application of experimental and statistical technique 
to this group of problems. Similarly, many studies have 
been reported on problems of mental inheritance, carrying 
over the same statistical methods from the field of biologi- 
cal investigation.” 
These, then, are the administrative and experimental 
problems which the school .man of to-day is trying to solve. 
During the past ten years he has turned decidedly to quan- 
titative methods in studying school practice. Each phase of 
school work is being subjected to “counting” methods of 
study. School discussions are becoming thoroughly factual. 
TI. Steps ry EpucationaL ReseARcH 
In revealing the problems of school research we have 
pointed out the outstanding methods of collecting educational 
data. At this point the student should have in mind at 
least a rough perspective of the general steps in the com- 
plete procedure of working out a statistical problem. In

Studies. (Warwick & York, Baltimore, Md., 1916.)

dike (referred to above); Whipple, G. M., A Manual of Physical and

1916); or in Meumann, E., Psychology of Learning (1916).

bringing to a close this introductory discussion we should 
now connect this first step in school research with the re- 
maining steps. To merely enumerate them at this point, 
a complete statistical analysis of a carefully-defined educa- 
tional problem would necessitate the following steps: —

4, The method of “averages” — representing the typical 
condition or “central tendency.” 
The method of “variability,” representing the extent 
to which data vary around the average. 
The method of relationship between various sets of 
data. 
The method of reliability — establishing the amount 
of dependence that one may place on the statistical 
results of his investigation. 
C. Graphic methods or the reporting of school facts. 
The use of various types of frequency curves, dia- 
grams, charts, etc.; the application of “type” fre- 
quency curves (e.g., the normal probability curve) to 
educational data. 
These steps and methods will be taken up and explained 
and illustrated in the chapters which follow. :

  CHAPTER II 
THE COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 
« Ir a superintendent of schools or an “interested citizen” 
wished to collect facts on any of the types of problems men- 
tioned in Chapter I, he would have access to four principal 
sources of original data. These may be stated, in tabular 
form, as follows: — 
I. Generau Sources or Oricinat Epucationan Data 
These general sources may be enumerated under the fol- 
lowing main headings: — 
A. State school laws and city board of education charters. 
Published official reports. 
I. Federal reports, generally published annually. 
a. Annual reports of the United States Bureau of the 
Census. 
6. Annual reports of the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation. 
c. Annual reports of the United States Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. 
II. State reports. : 
a. Reports of state superintendents of public instruction 
(or equivalent officer), or state boards of education, 
in each of the States. 
b. Reports of other state departments: e.g., Indiana 
Bureau of Statistics; state census reports; etc. 
III. Publications of city school systems. 
a. Manuals, by-laws, and rules and regulations of city 
boards of education. 
b. Periodic “proceedings” or “minutes” of meetings: 
1. Of city boards of education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
          COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 29 
2. Of permanent and special committees of boards 
of education. (Former are published in medium- 
sized and larger systems; latter are not.) 
. Annual reports of city boards of education. 
. Special bulletins, issued either by the superintendent 
or by some other school official, or, in a few cities, 
by the bureau in charge of school research. 
             as 
        
      . Types of school research by private agencies that may con- 
tain “original” data. 
I. School survey reports. Published reports are now 
available for forty to fifty cities, and eight States, few of 
which, however, contain “original” data. Material mostly 
of “summarized” and comparative type. 
II. Published reports of studies made by educational foun- 
dations (¢.g., Russell Sage Foundation, Division of Edu- 
cation; Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching; General Education Board). 
III. Published reports of studies made by individuals, con- 
taining, in rare cases, “original” data. 
          
                            
  D. The original records of: 
I. Federal and state bureaus or departments. 
II. City school systems. 
       
           
                  These, then, are the sources! which are now available for 
the collection of facts about educational practice and con- 
ditions. It will be of some value to describe briefly each of 
1 Each student of school research should also secure, each year, a bulle- 
tin issued by the United States Bureau of Education, entitled Educational 
Directory (for 1915-16, 1916-17, etc.). This publication contains complete 
lists of the names of officers of (1) United States Bureau of Education; 
(2) state school systems; (3) state library commissions; (4) superintendents 
of schools in cities and towns of 2500 population and over; (5) associate and 
assistant superintendents in larger cities; (6) county superintendents; and. 
(7) officers of miscellaneous institutions; e.g., schools of pedagogy, normal 
schools, colleges, and universities, schools for blind and deaf, feeble-minded, 
etc., schools of art and of industry, parochial schools, directors of museums, 
library schools, church educational boards and societies; state, national, 
and international educational and other learned and civic organizations.

the types of data that can be secured from each source, 
naming the kind of facts to be found, and characterizing 
the relative validity of each. 
  A. Scooot Laws anp Crry Scoot CHARTERS 
At the present time a codification of the state school 
laws (a summary of all legislation affecting the conduct of 
schools in each State) is issued by the Department of Edu- 
cation (or of Public Instruction) in nearly every State. 
Those desiring to collect detailed facts on the legal status 
of any aspect of school administration should turn to these 
sources. Various compilations of state legal provisions, and 
decisions of state and federal courts on school matters, have 
been made under the direction of the United States Bureau 
of Education. Bulletin no. 47 (1915), Digest of State Laws 
Relating to Public Education, in Force January 1, 1915, is 
a rather extensive compilation of the actual legal basis of 
American school administration. In addition to this, the 
United States Bureau of Education has issued each year a 
compilation of legislative and judicial decisions on educa- 
tion for the current year. Of all these sources, the codi- 
fications of the state school laws themselves are the only 
ones containing the detailed legislation. 
City school-board charters are found in various published 
sources, sometimes published and bound with certain issues 
of the annual report of the board of education; more com- 
monly published and bound with the rules and by-laws of 
the board. Thus they are quite generally reprinted only on 
dates of revision. 
Students who desire to study the legal basis of any as- 
pect of city or state school administration should turn 
to the original statement of the law itself, found in one 
of these sources.
-P-A-G-E-49
  COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 31 
B. Pusuisuep OrrictaL Reports 
1. Federal reports 
Educational statistics have been published annually by 
three federal agencies: the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau 
of Education, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Let us 
characterize each of these briefly. 
(a) Educational statistics in reports of the United States 
Bureau of the Census. Prior to 1912 this bureau published 
completely analyzed data on public-school finance. The 
most immediate sources were found in an annual bulletin 
called Financial Statistics of Cities, and covered all Ameri- 
can cities of 30,000 population and over. The published 
facts included complete descriptions of methods of securing 
the data, of the accounting terminology used by school 
statisticians, detailed statistics of receipts and disburse- 
ments, property valuations and municipal indebtedness for 
all city departments including schools, classified in such a 
way as to permit intelligent study of school costs. 
These data, as reported to and including the year 1911, 
were collected by agents of the bureau by personal tabula- 
tion from the records of the school systems in question. 
Data on school cost, to be comparable, must be classified 
on a uniform basis. Prior to 1911 it was a very evident fact 
there was no semblance of uniformity in the accounting 
methods of different. city school systems. Hutchinson in 
1914 reported that he visited thirty-eight cities trying to 
secure comparable data on school costs, and found the sum- 
marized statistics worked out on so many different bases 
that it was impossible to make comparative statements 
about the cost of different kinds of school service and school 
activities from these summary statements. The agents of 
the Bureau of the Census, therefore, rendered a distinct  
-P-A-G-E-50
         
   32 
  STATISTICAL METHODS 
service in classifying, in detailed fashion, and on pertinent 
educational bases, various educational financial data. The 
best assumption the student can make about the validity 
of original administrative data on school costs is that those 
in the reports of the Bureau of the Census are approximately 
accurate. The relative validity of these data and those in the 
reports of the United States Bureau of Education will be 
discussed below. 
In addition to the purely educational statistics that can 
be found in the Financial Statistics of Cities, in detailed 
form through 1911, and in general summary form since 
1911, the Bureau of the Census published many reports 
containing municipal, economic, population, and industrial 
statistics. Various special bulletins can be secured by ad- 
dressing the Director of the Census, Department of Com- 
merce and Labor, Washington, D.C. 
(b) Annual Reports of the United States Bureau of 
Education. The Commissioner of Education publishes each 
year an annual report, in two volumes. Volume 1 contains 
descriptive summaries of educational movements, past and 
present. Volume 2 reports detailed statistics of all phases 
of public and higher education in this country, for cities and 
towns of 2500 population and over. These include all facts 
on school finance analyzed in very detailed fashion, facts 
on the distribution, grades, experience, training, age, sex, 
and pay of teachers; facts on attendance, enrollment of 
pupils in public and higher special schools, etc. In addition 
to these the bureau also publishes, intermittently, compila- 
tions of original statistics covering particular aspects of 
school administration, as, for example, salaries paid to va- 
rious grades of teachers, together with number of teachers 
receiving these salaries; salary schedules, etc., for all cities 
above 2500 population, etc. 
Validity of data in reports of the Bureau of Education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 33 
These data have always been secured by question-blank 
methods; almost never by personal investigation of the 
records of the school systems by agents of the bureau. They 
are collected annually on a detailed blank form, the business 
and statistical clerks of the various systems filling in the 
required data. The result of the use of this method has 
been that the statistics have been very unreliable (for com- 
parative purposes), both absolutely and relatively. Prior 
to the year 1911 they were distinctly so, due to the fact 
that there was almost no uniformity in city school account- 
ing methods, and there was comparatively little agitation 
(at least prior to 1905) for getting cities to use uniform sys- 
tems of records and reports. During the years 1905 to 1910, 
a growing demand for improvement in these conditions led 
to the codperation of the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion, the National Education Association, and the newly 
formed National Association of School Accounting Officers 
(1910) in an attempt to standardize accounting and sta-~ 
tistical methods in city schools. A joint committee of 
these agencies recommended the adoption of a “Standard 
Form,” for recording and reporting all types of school sta- 
tistics. The Bureau of Education adopted this form in 1911 
for its annual collection of data, and a decided improvement 
has taken place in the character and validity of the school 
statistics during the past five years. It is estimated that 
fully five hundred American city systems are now classifying 
their records in accordance with this form. It is true, how- 
ever, that many cities, particularly some of our larger 
cities, having school officers of initiative and originality, 
have been slow to change their school accounting systems 
to accord with the standard scheme. Even to-day some of 
these, although laboriously retabulating their statistics for 
the Commissioner’s Report each year, use their own inde- 
pendent system of accounting.
-P-A-G-E-52
34 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  Thus, it is believed that, since 1911, the educational sta- 
tistics of the Bureau of Education have increased steadily 
in reliability for “comparative ranking purposes,” although 
still collected by question-blank methods. It is to be re- 
gretted that, with the use of the standard form by. the Bu- 
reau of Education, the Bureau of the Census stopped making 
its detailed classification of educational statistics in 1911, 
reporting since that time only very general summaries of 
school receipts, expenditures, indebtedness, etc. 
In making the study of the Public School Costs and Busi- 
ness Management in St. Louis (1916), the writer attempted to 
establish the validity of the statistics of the Bureau of Edu- 
cation for purposes of comparing various cities by arranging 
themin “rank” or “serial” order in their various financing 
activities. It was assumed that the financial statistics of the 
Bureau of the Census to and including the year 1911 were 
approximately correct. It was found that the Bureau of 
Education in the same year, 1911, published the same type 
of financial statistics, thus providing an opportunity for 
direct comparison of the absolute figures compiled by two 
agencies on identical school activities. Tables in the com- 
plete survey report give, as obtained from each source, the 
total expenditures and differences in amount spent for each 
of a list of cities, for nine different kinds of school service 
—special supervision, principalships, instruction, supplies, 
etc. Tables computed and stated in the survey report give 
the per pupil cost for each of these nine kinds of service, to- 
gether with the rank of each of the cities in the group for each 
item. It is clear from inspection of those tables that we have 
to discuss the validity of the data as collected from these 
two sources strictly in terms of the use we are going to make 
of them. First: if we merely are going to rank cities in terms 
of per pupil cost, then the statements made in the survey 
report are valid, namely: — “
-P-A-G-E-53
  COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 35 
With few exceptions the tables show a very satisfactory agree- 
ment in position, the costs for supervision and principalships being 
the ones for which less agreement would be expected than for any 
other activities. The conclusions that we form from one set of rec- 
ords will not be unlike those formed from the other set of records. 
Especially is this true in the case of the one city in which we are 
interested, St. Louis. We may summarize its position in all the 
tables as follows: — 
  
  Salaries of

Supervisors | Principals | Teachers | Repairs | Janitors

iE cyte: 7 1 8 4 8 
Bineau of Edu- 
cation . 6 9 6 3 8 
    
The largest displacement in the ranking for St. Louis is two places. 
As a result of the tabulation and ranking it is believed that the 
interpretations made on the financial situation in St. Louis, from 
cost tables computed from the Annual Report of the United States 
Bureau of Education, 1915, will be valid. Especially is this true 
since 1912 was the first year in which the bureau collected statis- 
tics on the standard form, and much improvement has come about 
since in the completeness and accuracy with which city systems 
report their school facts. 
The most frequent use that school men want to make 
of educational statistics is of this very “comparative” and 
“yanking” type. One point should be noted, however. 
These cities are the largest cities in the country, and have 
the most thoroughly equipped accounting and statistical 
staffs, supervised by specialists in this field. The experience 
and investigations of the writer lead to the belief: — 
(1) That considerable reliance may be placed on the com- 
parability of the classification of educational statistics for 
groups of medium-sized cities (15,000 to 40,000 for example). 
These cities are following the “Standard Form,” even more
-P-A-G-E-54
36 STATISTICAL METHODS 
closely than are the larger cities. The comparative financial 
statistics of the Bureau of Education for twenty-one cities in 
Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin (between the sizes of 15,000 
and 25,000, and within 150 miles of Chicago) have been 
checked with care. The results show a fair agreement be- 
tween the records as compiled by the bureau and by other 
agencies. The methods have been checked personally in 
three of these cities, and show that considerable reliance 
may be placed on the absolute expenditures reported, as 
well as on the “position”? of each city in the group. 
(2) In the study of larger cities, however, it was found 
that, if we wish to deal with the absolute statistics of cost, 
attendance, teaching staff, etc., we must make decided men- 
tal reservations in our acceptance of the Bureau of Edu- 
cation figures, In the first place, there are occasionally very 
large differences in reported figures due to incorrect classifica- 
tion (for example, expenditures for supervisors and principals 
in certain cities). In the second place, differences of 10 to 20 
per cent are relatively common in these tables. The present 
study, however, can merely warn the student of the large 
inaccuracies in the absolute figures reported by certain cities 
to the Bureau of Education. 
(c) Annual reports of the United States Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. If the school man desires statistics on the occu- 
pational situation, distribution of workers as to grade, trade, 
salaries paid, etc., he can find such data in annual reports 
and bulletins of this bureau, by addressing the director.

2. State school reports 
The superintendent of public instruction, or the depart- 
ment of education in each of the states, now issues either 
biennial or annual reports on educational activities in the 
state. A very considerable body of original statistical ma- 
terial may be found in these. It is fairly common, for ex- 
ample, to classify the statistics by counties, instead of enu- 
merating them for cities and towns. On the whole, it israrely 
that one can find detailed data on city schools in state school 
reports. Furthermore, it is uncommon to find data detailed 
enough on town and rural schools to permit of comparative 
studies of educational practice in specific communities. The 
reports are filled up with narrative reports from county and 
other school officers, from various special and] higher institu- 
tions controlled by the state, state courses of study, reports 
on county institutes, digests of school laws and legal deci- 
sions, state examination questions, and other types of de- 
scriptive material. They all give certain detailed financial 
and attendance statistics on the “common schools,” ar- 
ranged by counties. In exceptional cases, good comparative 
data can be obtained. For example, the state report for 
Missouri contains a detailed financial analysis for several 
hundred towns and cities in the state. It is possible to use 
the data in making a comparative cost study for particular 
communities, grouped in various ways. 
3. Publication of city school systems 
(a) Manuals, by-laws, rules, and regulations. All of our 
larger cities, and many of the smaller ones, print annually 
handbooks or “manuals” giving miscellaneous data con- 
cerning the administration of the city schools. They may 
include certain fiscal data for various city departments, 
and sometimes the “charter” under which the board oper- 
ates; the “‘by-laws” enacted by the board to govern its con-
-P-A-G-E-56
88 " ” STATISTICAL METHODS \ 
  duct and to create a complete working organization for the 
schools of the city, to endow and state specifically for each of 
the officers his powers and duties, and to state the “rules” 
governing the schools. They also contain, very probably, the 
districting of the city system, rules governing: (1) pupils; 
(2) grading, salary schedules, eligibility, appointment, pro- 
motion, etc., of teachers; (3) operation of departments out- 
side the educational department. 
- (b) ‘*Proceedings” or ‘‘ minutes” of meetings of city 
boards and their committees. These are now very generally 
printed for the larger cities, monthly, semi-monthly, or 
weekly. They very often are found to duplicate the fiscal 
facts printed annually in the school report; they often con- 
tain the detailed itemization of school facts that properly 
ought only to be typewritten and filed in the boards’ offices 
(e.g., financial itemization of all vouchers paid, regardless of 
amounts; lists of names of pupils graduating from various 
schools, etc.) 
(c) Annual school reports. It is a fairly common practice 
now for cities of 30,000 to 50,000 population, and above, to 
print an annual school report. During the past ten years dis- 
tinct changes have come about in the types of original data 
that these contain. The tendency toward standardization, 
uniformity, and a clearer classification of school facts is 
evidenced by the better organization of data. To a student 
desirous of making a comparative study of school conditions 
(say of cost, elimination and retardation, non-promotion, 
teaching staff, or what-not), the statement should be made 
that even now, with all the improvements which have been 
made in recent years, comparable statistics on these or other 
phases of school practice are not to be obtained from the 
annual school reports of our cities: This is true even for 
the very largest cities, with their well-organized accounting 
staffs,
-P-A-G-E-57
COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 39 
The above, in the main, comprise the larger sources in 
which students of educational administrative problems may 
find original data. In rare cases one can discover original 
detailed statistics in studies made by individual students, 
either working as officers of a city bureau of school research, 
or in some educational institution or “foundation.” 
In summing up this brief discussion of the sources and 
validity of original data, the writer would urge the direct 
collection of statistics and data from the records and persons 
in the school systems in question. Question-blanks sent out 
by individuals rarely have resulted in sound comparative 
conclusions that benefit school practice. The tendency at the 
present time is for question-blanks to receive a decreasing 
amount of respectful attention from a much overburdened 
school.world. When economically possible, personal collec- 
tion gives much more valid results. It leads to: (1) a more 
consistently uniform original record; (2) a complete original 
record (z.e., no data are suppressed); (3) thoroughly com- 
parable bases of interpretation; (4) a more consistent inter- 
pretation of the facts as expressed in original and summary 
tables. Studies which demand recourse to state school laws, 
charters, rules, and other official state and city documents 
rest, of course, upon a perfectly valid basis. 
I. Meruops or coutectina EpucationaL Data 
The source and validity of the various types of educa- 
tional statistics having been discussed, we now turn to the 
methods by which data are collected. The analysis of these 
methods, as given in Chapter I, made many references to 
the two most important methods: (1) use of the question- 
blank; (2) personal investigation. We shall next take up 
the detailed discussion of these two general methods, 
turning to the question-blank method first.

40 STATISTICAL METHODS 
A. The question-blank method of collecting educational 
data 
© Plate I shows the very great use that school men have 
made of the question-blank in studying their problems. 
There is hardly a phase of school administration that has 
not been subjected to that type of analysis. Present practice 
and conditions as to the content of the course of study have 
been established in arithmetic by Jessup and Coffman, and 
by Van Houten; in algebra by Denny’and Mensenkamp; 
in spelling by Pryor; in handwriting by Freeman; in the 
high-school subjects by Koos, etc.!_ The present status of 
the teaching staff is tabulated from the “Standard Form” 
replies each year by the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion. It has been studied by the use of the same method 
by Coffman, Thorndike, Coffman and Jessup, Ruediger, 
Manny, and Boice; by committees of the National Educa- 
tion Association and other organizations. The question- 
blank method has given facts on the age-grade distribu- 
tion of pupils, — collected by Thorndike, by Strayer (both 
through the agency and authority of the United States 
Bureau of Education), and by Ayres, working through the 
Russell Sage Foundation. Data on promotion plans have 
been collected at-various times by the United States Bureau 
of Education. The study of current practices in school fi- 
nance by the question-blank method, by Strayer, and by 
Elliott, although not leading to basic comparable results 
themselves, has stimulated the standardization of school 
financial methods very much. In the same way the status 
of certain phases of central administration has been de- 
termined by the work, for example, of Shapleigh, working 
for the Public Educational Association of Buffalo, in such 
studies as his determination of the effect of commission form

  COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 41 
of government on city school administration — forty-eight 
cities —and the present status of janitorial service in city 
school systems. 
Enough has been said here, therefore, to indicate the 
frequent use that has been made of the question-blank in 
school research. As indicated above, use of this method by 
persons working in no official capacity, or by an organiza- 
tion of the government, has done little more than stimu- 
late discussion of present practice and the need for greater 
standardization. Even the Federal Bureau of Education has 
had no real “ extractive power ” in its search for school facts, 
and we have already indicated the large inaccuracies in 
its original records. However, under various conditions we 
shall be forced to make some use of the “questionary” in 
our attempt to determine the status of current practice. 
For that reason it will be pertinent to give here a discussion 
of its design and use. 
1. The design of the question-blank 
Principal types of question-blanks. Question-blanks for 
the collection of educational data can be distinguished into 
three classes, in terms of the source and reliability of the 
facts for which they ask: (1) those asking for facts in the 
personal information of the reporter; (2) those asking for 
facts to be found in school records; and (3) those asking 
for introspective or retrospective analysis, judgments of spe- 
cialists, ete. 
I. Question-blanks asking for facts in the personal in- 
formation of the reporter. In the statistical studies in edu- 
cation many examples may be found of this type. They in- 
clude questions relating, for example, to the age and sex 
_ of the teachers, number of years of training in particular 
types of institutions, number of years of experience in 
various grades of public-school work, salary received dur-
-P-A-G-E-60
    42 r STATISTICAL METHODS 
ing various stages of the teacher’s career, certificates held, 
etc. Such questions all relate to the personal history of the 
person reporting the facts. It is probable that more reliance 
may be placed on such types of fact than on any other col- 
lected by the question-blank method. They do not involve 
the labor, on the part of the reporter, of going to the records 
of class, school, or system to get the data, with the con- 
sequent chance for error in transcription and of decrease in 
number of returns caused by the inability of the reporter to 
take the time necessary to make the search. 
A second sort of data obtained from the personal in- 
formation of the reporter pertains to facts concerning par- 
ticular phases of school practice. For example, a question- 
blank sent to teachers of English in high schools contained’ 
questions such as the following: — 
1. Do you have a special teacher in oral composition? Yes

2. Do you usea text in oral composition? Yes...... Nope

public speaking? Yes...... SHINOS i. tense 
6. Do oral lessons precede work in written composition? Yes

7. Who selects the topics in oral composition? The student 
Beaat ; teacher....... 
Inquiries conducted for the purposes of getting facts con- 
cerning the content of a particular course of study, names of 
textbooks used, methods of grading pupils, etc., all fall within 
this class. Providing questions have been clearly asked and 
cannot be misinterpreted, data of this type should be very 
reliable. Question-blanks demanding information in the
-P-A-G-E-61
  COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 43 
immediate possession of the reporter ought to result in a 
very large percentage of returns to the investigator. If the 
blank is clearly written, well planned, short, and definite, 
it should result in a return of two thirds to three fourths of 
the blanks sent out. 
2. Question-blanks asking for facts to be found in school 
records. In this group we include the collection of facts, 
concerning, for example, the age-and-grade distribution of 
pupils in schools; various inquiries of specialists which 
demand detailed copying of records (e.g., on the problem of 
retardation and elimination), total expenditures for various 
types of school activities, administration, instruction, oper- 
ation, maintenance, etc.; distribution of teachers’ time to 
various subjects; statements from payrolls, class enroll- 
ment records; total and unit costs, ete. With this type of . 
inquiry nothing but intimate acquaintance with the aims, 
and full recognition of the importance of the investigation, 
will cause the reporter to take the time to give comparable 
and complete data which will lead to the improvement of 
school practice. 
3- Question-blanks asking for introspective and retro- 
spective analyses, judgments of specialists, etc. In this 
group are found various types of psychological question- 
blanks; ¢.g., those from inquiries aimed at determining the 
status of methods of study. For example, a recent inquiry 
of this sort quotes liberally from an article on How My 
Brain Functions, and asks the reporter to check his own 
mental processes against those of the author, and tell him 
the result. The following excerpt illustrates this type: — 
Question: Often he “thinks of nothing.” In this state he ex- 
periences euphoria, a feeling similar to that of the con- 
valescing patient, who prefers to lie absolutely quiet. 
He experiences together with this intellectual lethargy 
a physical inertia. While in this condition he per-
-P-A-G-E-62
  44 STATISTICAL METHODS 
suades himself “‘to postpone until to-morrow what he 
should do to-day.” 
Answer: Do you note a similar phenomenon in your own ex- 
perience? Please state wherein your experience differs 
from that of Beaunis. 
The early stages of the child-study movement were quite 
given over to the “questionnaire” method, masses of judg- 
ments being accumulated concerning child life, mental and 
moral activity, and growth. Such studies involved most 
extreme types of “judgment” questions, and as such are the 
farthest removed from a purely factual basis. 
It is no doubt true that the compilation of data concern- 
ing particular phases of school practice by the question- . 
blank method will be necessary for some time to come. Since 
governmental agencies, such as the United States Bureau 
of Education and the various state departments of educa- 
tion, have no “real extractive power ”’ as yet, it is clear that 
individuals must do the work. It is also clear, as will be 
shown later, that few question-blank inquiries have resulted 
in establishing beyond a doubt the status of the particular 
question they were designed to study. This is largely due 
to the fact of hasty and incomplete planning of inquiry 
blanks, and lack of recognition of the many issues and 
difficulties arising in the carrying on of the problem. For 
this reason it appears worth while to discuss, somewhat 
in detail, the necessary steps in the carrying on of an in- 
quiry of this sort. 
2. Essential steps in school research by the question-blank 
method 
First step: acquaint yourself with the literature covering 
the field of your problem. Your first duty is to know what 
others have contributed to the solution of such problems. 
Read carefully, take notes, and make many comments on
-P-A-G-E-63
COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 45 
  every study made in your field. Many studies have contrib- 
uted little because of this very lack of acquaintance with 
what other workers have done. In this way needless dupli- 
cation will be avoided, needed repetition will be secured, 
and the mistakes and the excellencies of others’ research will 
be utilized to advantage. Our great need is to have the vital 
gaps in our knowledge filled in. The careful study of the 
literature of a specific field of work will lead to the selection 
of the exact problem upon which research is most urgently 
needed. 
Second step: specific definition of the problem. The suc- 
cess of your investigation depends upon the clearness with 
which you recognize the exact problem at hand, — espe- 
cially its educational implications. Write out a very specific 
and detailed statement of it. Visualize the carrying on of the 
study from the first step to the last. Ask yourself at every 
turn — what has this to do with school practice? What kind 
of facts shall be collected to throw light on this point? Does 
this point really belong in this inquiry? Plan in a rough way 
the tables to be made up as a result of sending out the ques- 
tion-blanks. In a word — project yourself through the en- 
tire investigation in order to be able to start with a per- 
fectly clear idea of what you are to study. It is probable 
that a most specific definition of your problem can come only 
after you have read the literature on the subject, and after 
you have actually worked through, at least in a preliminary 
way, the design of the question-blank itself. 
Third step: exact delimitation of the extent of the inquiry. 
Your study of the literature and your attempts to define 
your problem should lead to an exact determination of the 
points to be covered and the questions to be asked in your 
study. Plan the number and kinds of questions to be asked 
in the light of a careful estimate of the labor of tabulation 
and summary of results. Decide the number of replies
-P-A-G-E-64
    
   46 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  needed to establish definitely the status of your problem. 
In doing this, count on a return of from one third to three 
fourths of the blanks sent out, depending on the length of 
the blank, the possibility and ease of giving the information 
on the part of the reporter, and the clearness with which the 
pertinency of the investigation to the needs of school prac- 
tice is recognized by those to whom blanks are sent. In de- 
ciding the number of blanks to be collected, make use of 
methods of determining the minimum number of cases, such 
as are described in Chapter VIII. 
Secure enough cases to satisfy statistical “criteria of 
reliability,” and no more than are necessary to secure ac- 
ceptance of the results of your inquiry by the persons to 
whom you will present them. One study known to the 
writer involved the collection of 30,000 blanks, the original 
tabulation alone of the returns from which would have 
taken at least 700 hours of clerical labor. Careful study 
showed that the same conclusions could be derived from the 
tabulation of one fourth as many cases, with the reliability 
of the investigation established at every point. Further- 
more, the delimitation of the extent of the study calls for 
careful weighing: of the relative value of having a small 
number of questions and a large number of replies, or of 
having a large number of questions with a small number of 
replies. 
Fourth step: design of the questions on the blank. Noth- 
ing is more important to the success of the study than the 
careful placing and wording of the questions. The most 
detailed analysis should be made of each one. Ask yourself 
concerning each one: Is this question so worded that the 
reporter cannot misinterpret it? Has every term been 
clearly defined, so that the returns from different reporters 
will be exactly comparable? Is the question ambiguous ? 
Can it be answered by Yes, No, a phrase, a number, or a      
   
-P-A-G-E-65
  COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS Ay 
check mark? Has the person who will answer this question 
the information desired? Is there sufficient space allowed 
for the most complete answer desired? Will the questions 
lead to specific quantitative statements? Are they factual? 
Have I eliminated all confusion that might arise because 
“factual” and “judgment” questions have been put to- 
gether? A fundamental point to be kept in mind in this 
connection is: Can the replies to this question be tabulated 
so that the data can be definitely summarized and inter- 
preted? Still better, can the data called for at this point 
be more completely secured by tabulation on the question 
sheet itself? Such points will be illustrated thoroughly in 
the next section. 
Fifth step: design of the originai tabulation forms. Chap- 
ter III will take up in detail the tabulation of educational 
data. It should be pointed out here that an absolutely es- 
sential step in the design of a sound question-blank is the 
preparation of the forms upon which the original tabulation 
of the data is to be made. This means the planning of the 
specific headings of the tables to be compiled, and will re- 
quire definite decisions concerning the arrangement of 
questions and the probable types of returns to be secured. 
Preparation of the tables will lead to a clear-cut, logical 
arrangement of questions, so put together as to facilitate 
a clear presentation and discussion in the report. A little 
time spent at this stage of the work will aid much in the 
later organization of the completed discussion. 
Sixth step: preliminary collection of data on tentative 
question-blanks. Having decided on the wording and 
arrangement of the questions, collect some data for pre- 
liminary analysis of your blank and tabulation forms. Have 
your blank mimeographed, making say 20 to 30 copies, and 
ask members of the group to whom will be sent the final in- 
quiry to fill in the questions. Tabulate these returns on your
-P-A-G-E-66
  48 STATISTICAL METHODS 
forms, and note the difficulties of tabulation and errors in 
interpretation of the questions. Only in this way can your 
blank or your forms be made thoroughly usable. Careful 
study of the returns will enable you to revise both the word- 
ing and the arrangement of the blank. Mimeograph it again 
and try it on another group, tabulating the returns. Re- 
vise once more and prepare the final copy for the printer. 
In selecting a group to fill in the preliminary blank, take 
the persons entirely at random (e.g., arrange them alpha- 
betically and take every nth one). This will enable you 
to foretell from the returns, roughly, the proportion of the 
entire number of cases that you can.expect to receive and 
will aid you in deciding how many blanks to send out. 
Seventh step: preparation of printed blank. If the in- 
vestigation is at all extensive the blank should be printed. 
Practical criteria of handling and filing returns should con- 
trol the selection of the material to be used. If financially 
expedient and practically possible, use a light-weight card 
instead of paper. If this is done use standard sizes, either 
3 by 5 inches, 5 by 8 inches, or 83 by 11 inches. This will 
facilitate filing the returns later. 
These, then, are the necessary steps in the design of a 
sound question-blank: — know the literature concerning 
the problem; define the problem specifically; limit the 
extent of the inquiry carefully; scrutinize minutely each 
question included on the blank; design the forms upon 
which the original tabulation is to be made; organize the 
tentative question-blank, and try it on 20 to 30 persons; 
tabulate the returns, revise the blank, try it on another 
group, and tabulate again; print the final copy on standard- 
sized material, using cards where possible.

3. Guiding principles concerning the content and form 
of the question-blank 
There are many important points concerning the selec- 
tion of questions and the form of the blank that need to be 
commented upon before leaving this question. 
1. ‘Factual ” questions. A fundamental principle for the 
selection of questions is that they must be as “factual” as 
possible: Thus, questions should involve a minimum of 
“judgment,” discrimination, or “deferred memory” on the 
part of the reporter. For example, in this question, asked in 
an inquiry on the economic condition of the members of the 
general teaching staff of the country: — 
Check the item that would-most nearly represent the parental 
annual income when you began teaching: — 
$250 or less, 
$250 to $500, etc. 
  The answer demanded memory of a situation many years 
past, in addition to the calculation of various items entering 
into the answer. The data obtained must be of very ques- 
tionable value. 
2. Difficulties with ‘‘ general” questions. Education 
question-blanks have abounded in “ general’? questions. 
One type is the sort that nearly always can be answered 
“Yes,” while at the same time it is nearly impossible to 
reply more specifically. For example, in a recent state survey 
of commercial education we find such questions as: — 
  Do you have difficulty in obtaining clerical help? 
Do you find pupils, 14 to 18 years of age, who come from ele- 
mentary and high schools, deficient in general education? 
Another type of the “ general”’ question is that which leads 
to unanalyzed and practically unanalyzable statements. 
It tends to hide up the specific facts out of which it might be 
possible to construct a valid general statement. To illustrate,
-P-A-G-E-68
  50 STATISTICAL METHODS 
we quote a question on the cost of teacher’s education, asked 
in a recent survey: — 
Estimated cost of your education beyond the high school, in- 
cluding specific items, as cost of tuition, books, board and 
room;'-ete.*..:055.: ; and estimated cost of time as measured by 
the amount that you could have earned at productive employ- 
ment during this period of training; ....... Totalss.canes 
The answers to “general’’ questions seldom can be tabu- 
lated and definitely interpreted. It is a safe rule to follow 
that data which do not lend themselves to tabulation and 
statistical treatment are of negligible value to the investi- 
gator. That is, answers should be definite and susceptible 
of tabular classification and this should be a controlling 
criterion in the planning of questions. Such questions as 
those below, taken from a “study” of the course of study, 
hardly render themselves subject to that kind of treat- 
ment. 
1. In what way (if at all) is your teaching of the following sub- 
jects determined by the peculiar needs and opportunities of the 
local community or district served by the school: — 
PNPUICUMATOS Serre Rohl fats wih ah snl as asissoe eae 
MVlsnualstramin gree ewe vt led ssc cc wey clei ticis.s < dae ieee 
Arithmetic .... Be 
Geograpliysis:.1.2e ee ead eb Oe ie oe 
ete. 
2. What in general is the attitude of the parents toward “home 
work” in school studies... ... 
3. What is the attitude of your community toward: — 
(a) Taking pupils on excursions to study neighboring in- 
dustries, ete. ...... 
    Many of these “ general’? questions demand of the re- 
porter a type of discriminative judgment that but few 
people possess, and those only specialists trained to that 
particular thing. To illustrate: —
-P-A-G-E-69
    COLLECTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACTS 51 
What difference in training do you notice between public high- 
school commercial graduates and graduates of the common 
private business colleges? ...... 
3. Ambiguity of statement. Many difficulties in tabulation 
and interpretation arise from ambiguity of statement of the 
question. For example, the following question, on which 
thousands of replies had been collected from elementary 
public-school teachers, had to be eliminated from the study 
because of the confusion in interpretation of the werd 
“school” by many of those reporting. 
Total number of pupils in the entire school ...... 
Number of teachers in the school, including superintendent or 
principal if he teaches ...... 
Number of pupils in the high-school department ...... 
In the grades ...... 
The returns indicated that a large proportion of the re- 
porters had interpreted “school” to mean “school system.” 
Many teachers from the same system reported on the 
same conditions, thus permitting a check. Of course, the 
question should never have been asked of teachers at all, 
but of the administrative officer. 
4. Information difficult to obtain. Apropos of asking for 
facts in the immediate personal information of the reporter, 
it will be recognized that we must not ask for general facts 
that the reporter cannot give without corsiderable search 
on his part. For example, we find on a question-blank con- 
cerning the distribution of workers in certain occupations, 
sent to the superintendent of schools of the city in question, 
the following: — 
1. Number of children in your community between 14 and 16 
years of age at work or idle. ...... 
What are they doing if at work ...... 
Number of families of this whole out-of-school group to whom 
this income of the youth is necessary. ......       
    
  
-P-A-G-E-70

2. State the number of workers (in this pursuit), male and female, 
with different ages; the number 14 years old, 
, etc., up to 80. The number of years of 
schooling of each of these workers by age and sex 
The impossibility of the reporter in question filling in 
these data is evident. 
In this connection it is clear that we should not ask for 
data which cannot be given accurately and in detail by the 
reporter, when at the same time the detailed information is 
available in printed records. For example, this question, on 
a blank directed to each of the teachers in various systems, 
should not have been asked: — 
State the population of the village, town, city, or district in 
which you teach 
  5. Other types of information. If you desire to compute 
percentages, plan the questions concerning the nwmber of 
ttems so that percentages can be worked from the collected 
data. For example, desiring to know the proportion of 
brothers and sisters who lived to adulthood, one investiga- 
tor asked: — 
How many brothers and sisters lived to early adulthood or 
longer? 
He omitted to ask for the total number of brothers and 
sisters. 
In studying problems involving many stages of growth 
or progress one must be careful to include all the possible 
stages or grades. A detailed question of this type is: — 
You attended country district school ...... years, village 
BohooL 23.5. years, city graded school ...... years, one- 
teacher high school ...... years, larger high school ...... 
years, private academy years, normal school ...... 
years, military school years, college or university 
Sees years, graduate school ...... years, etc.

  4. Rules governing the form of question-blanks 
In concluding the discussion on the design of question- 
blanks there are certain rules of form that well may be set 
down: — 
1. State the questions specifically. Beware of general 
headings or word or phrase captions. Use complete sentences 
or phrases long enough to convey your exact meaning to 
your most careless reporter. Discount the ability of your 
reporter to discriminate and interpret what is meant. Define 
and, if necessary, redefine each term which is in any respect 
technical, or which possibly can be misinterpreted by the 
least intelligent reporter in your group. 
2. Plan the introductory or explanatory paragraph so 
clearly and completely that it will acquaint the reporter 
fully with what you are doing and enlist his interest in your 
problem. Be careful to show the pertinency of your inquiry 
to the improvement of his conditions or at least to the 
improvement of school practice in some particular. If you 
cannot do this your investigation is of doubtful value, and 
coéperation will not be given you. 
3. Questions of arranging the form of the sheet are very 
important. Striking defects of nearly all question-blanks are 
(a) lack of clear organization of questions; (b) lack of suffi- 
cient space for answers; (c) lack of tabular schemes by which 
the reporter can give numerical data. 
4. If the tabulation forms are designed in advance, and 
the complete plan of the report is sketched, the questions 
will be systematically organized on the sheet with this view. 
Arrange them in the order in which you wish to tabulate 
and to discuss the points of your report. Logical organiza- 
tion at such early stages of the procedure will enhance the ~ 
clarity of your later discussion. 
5. Plan sufficient space for the longest possible answer to
-P-A-G-E-72
54 STATISTICAL METHODS 
the question. This can be done effectively by insisting on 
a preliminary filling-in of the blanks. If you do this you will 
be almost sure to redesign the blanks in order to give longer 
spaces. It is rare that question-blanks are well planned in 
this particular. 
6. When asking for continuous numerical data, provide 
a tabulation form on the question-blank upon which the re- 
porter can fill in the data. Plan this tabulation form very 
carefully, so as to prevent errors in interpretation and in 
subsequent tabulation. To illustrate this point, a portion of 
a question-blank on junior high-school costs is quoted here- 
with: — 
V. Omitting all names, will you give the individual yearly 
salaries that were paid junior high-school principals, 
teachers, supervisors of special subjects, and principals’ 
clerks during the school year 1914-15. 
To make it easier for you, the salaries are arranged in groups 
in one column. In the opposite column (marked “No. re- 
ceiving”), will you place the number who received the 
salary stated? 
Example. If four women teachers and one man teacher re- 
ceive annual salaries between $800 and $825 respectively. 
enter them thus: —

The foregoing pages have set before us essential principles 
and methods to govern our practice in the collection of edu- 
cational facts by the use of question-blanks. It is undoubted 
that the more important contributions to the improvement 
of school practice will come through personal collection of 
facts and actual contact with the school situation itself. 
We should next bring in review ways and means of utilizing 
such methods. Since these make such complete use of tabu- 
lar analysis we will take them up in connection with the 
tabulation of educational data, in the next chapter.

  CHAPTER TI 
THE TABULATION OF EDUCATIONAL DATA 
As students of education have turned to quantitative 
methods of solving their problems, the use of “ questionary ” 
methods of collecting facts has rapidly given way to inten- 
sive personal investigation. Plate I shows semi-graphically 
the extent to which such methods have been used to estab- 
lish the status of various types of problems. A brief summary 
of them may be given at this point. 
I. Mernops or Persona INVESTIGATION OF 
EpucaTionaL Prositems 
A. Statistical compilation from printed material. Under 
this heading we have: — 
1. Tabular analysis of provisions of public school laws and 
city charters, to establish the legal status of various ad- 
ministrative problems. For example: current practices in 
the various states concerning the certification of teachers; 
constitutional and state-school-code provisions for the ad- 
ministration of education in rural and city districts; the eom- 
position, methods of selecting, powers, tenure of office, and 
compensation of boards of education; methods of raising 
and apportioning school funds. 
2. Tabular analysis of rules, by-laws, and manuals of city 
boards of education. By this method we determine the status 
of the appointment, pay, and tenure of teachers and other 
employees; the powers and duties of committees of the 
board and of its officers, and the basis of carrying on the 
instructional and business activities of the system.
-P-A-G-E-76
58 STATISTICAL METHODS 
8. Tabular analysis of textbooks and prinied courses of 
study, to determine the present status of the content of the 
course of study and the relative efficiency of the order of 
presentation of topics in various subjects of study. 
4. Tabular analysis of the data given in federal, state, and 
city official reports. The types of data, validity of each, and 
problems which can be treated from these have been taken 
up in the previous chapters. 
5. Tabular analysis of the data found in the records of 
city school systems. Only by personal tabulation of facts 
from such records can we expect to make real progress in 
making known the facts on present school practice in this 
country. The school “survey movement” in this connection 
is lending great impetus to the work. Detailed comparative 
analysis of groups of cities is establishing definitely: — 
facts on the teaching staff; age-grade, elimination, and re- 
tardation facts on the pupil; facts on the marking system; 
detailed and systematic compilation of facts on revenue, ex- 
penditures, and unit costs; and facts on the central admin- 
istration and business management of public schools. 
6. Tabular analysis of facts in experimental and statistical 
descriptive literature. 
B. Tabular analysis of results of experimentation. Under 
this heading we have: — 
7. Tabular analysis of the “abilities”? or “achievements”? 
of pupils, through the design of “mental” or “educational” 
> tests. 
8. Tabular analysis of facts from experiments in “learn- 
ing,” “mental discipline,” etc. 
9. Tabular analysis of facts concerning the efficiency of 
teaching secured through the personal observation of teaching, 
with or without the aid of “efficiency score-cards,” or schedules 
of “qualities of merit in teaching.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  TABULATION OF EDUCATIONAL DATA 59 
Systematic tabulation of facts. It will be noted that the 
collection of data in the “scientific” study of education is 
either: (1) straight statistical compilation of facts, from vari- 
ous principal sources; or (2) dependent upon the preliminary 
setting up of auxiliary devices for measurement (stand- 
ard tests, score cards, etc.), and the conducting of experi- 
mentation. Either procedure necessitates the same funda- 
mental auxiliary method: the systematic tabulation of facts. 
Experience has shown that the thoroughness and insight 
displayed in planning and carrying through the original 
tabulation is an important factor in determining the success 
of the investigation. We have seen already the necessity 
for planning the scheme of tabulation in detail at the time 
of designing the question-blank. The two steps in the general 
research thus must be carried on together — the efficiency 
with which one is done contributing to the success of the 
other. Although it is recognized that the planning of tabula- 
tion forms is a task, the detailed execution of which must be 
carried on so as to fit each particular problem, there are cer- 
tain general guiding principles which, if discussed here, may 
save the student or investigator much wasted time and 
effort. 
Original and secondary tabulations. We speak of tabula- 
tion in general as “original” tabulation and as “‘secondary” 
tabulation. By original tabulation we shall mean the prep- 
aration of detailed tables on which are compiled the original 
data. By secondary tabulation we shall mean the prepara- 
tion of tables which summarize the original data, and which 
permit comparisons of “groups” by means of “averages,” 
measures of “‘variability,’’ and measures of “relationship.” 
The discussion of this chapter relates to the original tabu- 
lation of educational data. The complete treatment of second- 
ary tabulation is included in Chapters IV to IX inclusive.

I, HAND TABULATION 
There are two important phases to the work of tabulation. 
The first has to do with the selection of the general scheme 
of tabulation, while the second deals with the method of 
tabulation. 
We first face the question: What general scheme shall be 
used in compiling the original data—ruled cards, large 
ruled sheets, or ruled blank books? Two criteria control the 
selection of the general scheme: 
(1) How many separate points are to be covered by the 
inquiry and how many cases are to be tabulated? 
(2) Which method of tabulation is to be used, the “writing 
method”’ or the “checking method’’? 
Since the selection of the general scheme depends so 
completely on the adopted method of tabulation, that will 
be discussed next. 
1. The method of tabulation 
The writing method vs. the checking method. In com- 
piling the original data of the inquiry, whether from ques- 
tion-blank returns or from original records, the investigator 
can adopt one of two procedures. He can write out the de- 
tailed data covering each point of his inquiry in the fashion 
indicated by Table 3. The data in the table are quoted 
from the illustrative tables in a study covering the social 
conditions and careers of more than five thousand teachers. 
It will be noted that the original data, compiled from the 
question-blanks, are written out in detail on this sheet. 
The only abbreviation of the data occurs in such questions 
as that covering “parental income,” in which each of the

62 STATISTICAL METHODS 
various intervals $250 or less, $250-$500, $500-$750, etc., 
is given a code number, and these numbers are tabulated, 
5, 2, 9, 9, 4, ete. This is done, however, merely to save the 
time of writing the complete record for each teacher, and 
does not contribute at all to the more rapid summarization 
of the data later. In fact, in having to apply the code number 
to each case the tabulator is very likely handicapped in the 
rapidity and accuracy with which he compiles the data. It 
should be noted carefully that as a result of such a detailed 
original tabulation the original records are transcribed in full 
at a very considerable expense, but that no summarization 
has been done and none is possible on this table. The compu- 
tation of averages and measures of variability and relation- 
ship for various comparable groups cannot be done without 
complete retabulation of the data. This brings us to a fun- 
damental principle of tabulation: the original tabulation 
should lead at once to group “totals,” and to the rapid computa- 
tion of the necessary statistical measures, averages, measures 
of variability, etc. It is clear that the “writing method” of 
tabulation does not do this, and that for extensive inves- 
tigations it is not an economical method. 
The checking method. This brings up the checking 
method of tabulation, and we can illustrate its use by 
representing the same data given in Table 3. Its first dis- 
tinctive feature is found in the form of the “heading” pre- 
pared for the tabulation. Now, instead of using a general 
blanket heading “‘age,”’ for example, or “number of months ” 
(“for which present contract is drawn’’) etc., we prepare a 
scheme of column headings, one column of the table being 
left for each possible reply, or perhaps for the smallest range 
covered by such replies. To illustrate, the column headed 
“age” in Table 3, now becomes a series of columns as in 
Table 4.

The records of ‘‘age” from Table 3 are retabulated by 
“checking” the appropriate column for each teacher. A 
second distinctive feature now stands out, — this method of 
tabulation at once permits grouping of data, and the im- 
mediate and easy compilation of totals, and of “averages” 
and measures of “variability.” The student should be cau- 
tioned to classify his records carefully at the start so as to per- 
mit the tabulation of the data on a perfectly uniform group 
of individuals on one sheet or page. For example, the data 
given in Tables 3 and 4 should refer to teachers who are 
teaching under the same conditions, or who are from other 
standpoints perfectly comparable with each other. If this is 
done, as far as possible, the labor of retabulation in the 
subsequent statistical treatment of the data will be cut to a 
minimum. 
To adopt the checking method on such points as “Age,” 
in which many columns are needed, raises the question 
“How large shall the interval be made, — 1 year, 3 years, 
5 years, or what?’’ Chapter IV discusses the statistical 
classification of data in great detail, and this question can 
best be answered for the reader by suggesting the reading
-P-A-G-E-82
   
   64 STATISTICAL METHODS 
of that chapter, with the subsequent rereading of this dis- 
cussion. In that treatment a complete discussion of the size 
of the interval, its position, and best methods of marking 
limits, etc., are given. 
To use the checking method, therefore, we must plan, 
at the start, a series of column headings sufficiently detailed 
to cover the range of possible replies on each point. The 
thought will arise immediately in the mind of the reader: 
“But the preparation of column headings is expensive, both 
of material and of the time of the tabulator.” The first point 
is admittedly of not sufficient weight to demand consider- 
ation. The second is important, however. As the result of 
the detailed experience of the writer with both the writing 
and the checking methods, it can be said that the latter is 
by far the more economical in the long run. To offset the 
utilization of time in preparing column headings:we have 
three distinct savings: (1) that due to checking answers 
instead of writing them out in detail; (2) that due to the 
possibility of totaling the data in each column rapidly and 
accurately; (3) the fact that averages and other statistical meas- 
ures can be computed for the various groups of data from the 
original record. To these we should add that the checking 
method gives a more accurate perspective of the returns, per- 
mits better preliminary planning of the treatment of the 
data, and leads to a more adequate interpretation of results. 
Schemes for tabulation. We said above that the selec- 
tion of the scheme of tabulation depended not only on the 
method of tabulation, but also upon the number of points 
to be covered by the inquiry and the number of cases to be 
collected. In deciding on the scheme of tabulation we have 
a choice of the use of : (1) the ruled card; (2) the large ruled 
sheet; and (3) the ruled blankbook. 
1. Use of the ruled card. It will be evident that the ruled 
card (regulation sizes, 4 by 6, 5 by 8, 83 by 11) is adapted  
-P-A-G-E-83
TABULATION OF EDUCATIONAL DATA, 65, 
  to only the most restricted investigations, — those covering 
a comparatively small number of separate points and in 
which but few cases (perhaps 25 to 50) are to be collected. 
It has the advantage of facilitating manipulation and filing 
of the data. Such a scheme is excellently adapted to those 
compilations of data in which a single question may be put 
on a card, rulings being adapted in such a way as to give the 
data from each case on this particular point. This scheme 
is well adapted to the collection of data on various phases of 
city school administration by buildings, by kinds of schools, 
or by kinds of activities. 
2. Use of the large ruled sheet. This is adapted to some- 
what more extensive investigations, — those covering per- 
haps 50 to 100 points and as many cases. To the tabu- 
lation, for example, of the content of courses of study, or 
of the study of the content of textbooks, the large ruled 
sheet (19 by 24 inches is a standard size and easily manip- 
ulated) is well fitted. Its chief advantage lies in the clear 
perspective which it gives of all of the data covering a par- 
ticular group of items or cases. It also permits easy second- 
ary tabulation. It is used in large city systems, in many 
phases of the office tabulation of records; for example, in 
the standardizing of school supplies, both as to kind and 
amount, tabulation of ‘building’ records, tabulation of 
bids, ete. 
3- Use of the ruled blankbook. Nearly all educational 
investigations are extensive enough in number of points 
covered and in number of cases collected to demand tabu- 
lation of the original records in ruled blankbooks. A good 
rule is to use a book of standard size (say 8 by 10 inches) 
with cross-sectional ruling (to facilitate the non-uniform rul- 
ings which will be needed for data of the particular inquiry 
at hand) and including perhaps 60 to 100 pages. Thirty to 
forty cases can be tabulated on the length of the page. If
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 STATISTICAL METHODS 
the checking method of tabulation is being used, the column 
headings should be arranged in the order of questions on 
the question-blank (if it is a question-blank inquiry), and 
the edge of the pages should be “‘cut-back”’ sufficiently to 
permit the use of the original list of names or numbers, writ- 
ten on the first page of the record. In this way, the entire 
record of an individual appears on the same line of the tab- 
ulation even though it may cover many pages in length. If 
the questions on the blank have been numbered consecu- 
tively as they should, these numbers could be used as column 
headings. There is almost no type of extensive investiga- 
tion to which the ruled book is not well adapted, and in 
general it should have wide usage. 
Il. THE MECHANICAL TABULATION OF EDUCATIONAL 
STATISTICS 
A recent development in statistical work. The discussion 
thus far has dealt with problems of school research which 
have implied the use of hand tabulation. For the tabulation 
and manipulation of the detailed educational and business 
records of a school system, the experience of school men is 
proving that electrical mechanical tabulation is both more 
economical and more efficient. Within the past few years, 
New York, Philadelphia, Rochester, Oakland (California), 
and other cities have adopted such methods and have 
proven their superiority to hand methods. To get the meth- 
ods clearly before us, together with the consensus of prac- 
tical judgment on their availability, quotations from recent 
discussions of the matter will be given. 
Four methods. The following statement, by the Audi- 
tor of the Board of Education, New York City,! indicates 
four distinct methods of preparing statistical data: — 
1 Cook, H. R. M. “The Standardization of School Accounting and of 
School Statistics’; in American School Board Journal, June and July, 1913. 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  TABULATION OF EDUCATIONAL DATA 67 
1. By means of the electrical tabulating and sorting machine 
and electrical battery adding machine, and by the use of perforated 
cards. 
2. By means of cards of uniform size, on which are printed the 
statistical classifications, while the figures or amounts are inserted 
by hand. The margin of the card may be perforated by hand. 
This last process permits of a limited range of information being 
assembled. It also affords a means of assembling quickly all cards 
which relate to one or more items of classification. When assembling 
statistics from these cards, the use of the adding machine is ad- 
visable. 
3. By the use of a columnar collateral ledger, exhibiting the 
various statistical classifications under which may be recorded the 
salient feature of the expenditure as shown by the voucher or by 
the voucher register. 
4. By so planning the books of accounts as to include analysis 
columns in which should be entered, synchronously with the passage 
of a voucher, that particular statistical classification to which the 
expenditure may be applicable. 
The first method is suitable either for large or for moderate-sized 
school systems, in fact, it may be profitably used anywhere, ex- 
cept in the case of the small rural organizations. In any city or 
town where the population exceeds 20,000 inhabitants, the installa- 
tion of a statistical plant of this kind would be advantageous. Not 
only is it possible to make a complete distribution of school expen- 
ditures, but school facts of important character, both educational 
and physical, may be recorded with great speed, accuracy, and 
minuteness. A uniformly printed card, a few square inches in size, 
is susceptible of use for the purpose of recording thousands of facts 
of most varied nature. No matter how the cards may be fed 
through the machine, the sorting machine automatically separates 
each fact. The widest imaginable range of statistical information 
can be produced by the adoption of the first method. The system 
involves the compilation of a “code” in which each statistical 
point of information or fact is assigned to a number or combination 
of numbers. An illustration of the form of card used will be found 
among the diagrams. The cost of rental and operation of this type 
of statistical outfit in a small or moderate sized school system would 
be about the same as the salary of a clerk. In a large system it 
might reach the cost of two such clerks. 
The second method is suitable for a system of any size and is
-P-A-G-E-86
68 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  very elastic, but it lacks the speed and wide range of the first- 
described method. It was actually and successfully employed for 
some years in one of the largest school systems in the world. It 
was only displaced because of the superiority of the first-described 
method, because the rental of a machine is cheaper than clerk 
hire. The cost of stationery is about the same. In a small school 
system the total cost would probably trend the other way, but not 
sufficiently far to make up for the extra efficiency and wide range 
of the mechanical device. An illustration suggestive of a suitable 
form of card will be found among the diagrams accompanying this 
treatise. 
The third method represents a purely hand-made system, and is 
intended to operate in parallel with the regular books of account. 
The volume of the expenditures in the fund accounting will neces- 
sarily equal the volume of the statistical accounting between given 
points. This method permits of the preparation of data sufficient 
- for the purposes of the standard blanks of the United States Bureau 
of Education, but it does not afford any very wide range of in- 
formation which it might be desirable to collect for local purposes. 
The fourth method is a modification of the third just-described 
method. It is suitable for school systems of a size which are re-

The Oakland, California, method. That the utilization of 
“mechanical tabulation”’ is not confined to the largest sys- 
tems, but that it is efficient and economical in any city in 
which Tabulating Service Bureaus have been established, 
is shown by a recent report of Mr. Wilford E. Talbert, 
Director of Reference and Research, Oakland, California. 
After discussing the way in which the statistical reports of 
teachers, principals, and other employees are compiled by 
time-saving methods he says: — 
Transferring reports to Hollerith cards. Assoon as the teachers’ 
reports are received in the Superintendent’s office, the information 
they contain is punched onto Hollerith cards by a clerk who, be-

cause she specializes on this sort of work, is at least as apt to 
detect errors as any but the most careful principals. After the 
cards are punched they are all checked for accuracy by reading back 
the data to another clerk holding the original reports. 
On the Hollerith cards (Diagram 13 reproduces an Oakland 
card), error has been carefully guarded against by color of cards, 
by clipping of corners, and by code numbers. Also an attempt has 
been made to foresee every possible kind of information. that 
might ever be wanted from the reports for the given period. By the 
use of code numbers for sorting fields, this becomes very simple 
under the Hollerith system. In fact, someone has called the 
Hollerith cards ‘canned information,” and, like canned goods, they 
are always on hand, they are compact, and their contents is al- 
ways readily available. For example, it is possible in a few min- 
utes on the sorting machine to take from the entire year’s reports, 
the cards for special classes, for any given teacher, for any desired 
grade, for any teacher’s register in the city (even though that regis- 
ter itself may have been burned), and all the data on these cards 
can be quickly tabulated in any desired way, even though none of 
this information is tabulated from month to month. 
The work of tabulating results. As soon as all reports are received 
and all data have been transferred to the Hollerith cards, the latter 
are called for in the morning by the Tabulating Service Co., and 
the following four reports are returned by the same evening: —   
1, Attendance and absence by schools and kinds of schools. 
(188 sums.) 
2. Total enrollment by schools, by kinds of schools, and by de- 
partments of each school. (141 sums.) 
8. Distribution of enrollment in non-departmental, and in de- 
partmental classes of the elementary schools, showing the 
number of classes of each size from the smallest to the largest, 
and giving the location by schools of all classes which are 
either exceptionally large or exceptionally small. (790 signifi- 
cant figures reported last month.) 
These reports are all typed and arranged in such shape that 
this office can readily write in the names of schools and such aver- 
ages, etc., as it is necessary to compute on the calculating machine. 
Even the typing is mechanically checked for error, so that we have 
absolutely reliable and unchangeable data as a basis for further 
computations,

  TABULATION OF EDUCATIONAL DATA a 
Use of the plan at Rochester, New York. The statistical 
bureau of the school system of Rochester, New York, uses 
mechanical tabulation methods. Mr. J. S. Mullan, Sec- 
retary of the Board of Education, discusses the method in 
part as follows: ! 
Up to the present time, the analysis of school expenditures and 
the development of school statistics have been restricted. because 
of cost and the time element, — that is, whether the information 
would be worth what it would cost, and whether it could be compiled 
in time for administrative and legislative use. With the adaptation 
of machinery to statistical purposes, we are entering upon a new 
era of statistical possibilities. With mechanical tabulation, cost 
and the time element are being reduced to the minimum. In fact, 
statistical analyses, heretofore prohibitive and practically impos- 
sible, are now being compiled, used, and demanded. 
With mechanical tabulation, the bookkeeping division becomes 
a machine shop. The machinery consists of card-punching ma- 
chines operated by hand (for individual cards and cards in gangs), 
a card-sorting machine [pictured in Diagram 14] operated by elec- 
tricity, and a tabulating machine [pictured in Diagram 15], also 
operated electrically. The cards used in connection with the ma- 
chines are somewhat larger than regular index cards. Upon the 
cards are printed what are technically known as “fields,” each 
field representing an item of information. The field consists of 
vertical lines of varying distances apart, in which appear numerals, 
each field containing one or more perpendicular rows of numerals 
according to the requirements of each of the fields. The card which 
has been adopted for use in the accounting division of the Rochester 
school system shows the year and month; voucher number; vendor; 
school building; day, night, continuation or normal school; function; 
sub-function; educational subject; character of expenditure; quan- 
tity; unit of measure; commodity; class and number; price; amount; 
fund; and whether contract, open-market order, pay-roll, or mis- 
cellaneous expenditure. 
Expressed in a numerical code, the information is punched on the 
cards by the operator striking keys which perforate the cards with   
1 “Mechanical Tabulation of School Financial Statistics’; in Proceed- 
ings of the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Notional Association of School Ac- 
counting Officers, p. 43.

72 STATISTICAL METHODS 
small holes. Any data appearing on the requisition, invoice, pay- 
roll, or voucher can thus be transferred to the cards, after which 
the cards are ready for sorting and tabulation. It can be seen that 
once the cards are punched and checked with the original docu- 
ment, the period of detail checking is over. All the data punched 
on the cards are elemental. The total of the cards is the sum of the 
elements. Once punched and checked, the cards go to the sorting 
machine, where by electrical contact through the holes in the cards 
they are sorted into any pre-determined group; thence they go to 
the tabulating machine, where in the same way they are tabulated 
by groups and in total, the totals when obtained being entered 
on a prearranged form. The sorting and tabulating may be repeated 
until all the fields on the cards have been covered, the final totals of 
the various sortings being the automatic check. Furthermore, the 
punching of the cards and their tabulation are accomplished in a 
comparatively short period of time, so that any group result or com- 
bination of results is expeditiously produced, and at a minimum of 
cost. 
Compare the possibilities of this procedure with distribution by 
hand posting, including the factor of possible clerical] error, the diffi- 
culty of attempting to carry on more than one analysis at one and 
the same time, 7.e., functional service, amounts of compensation, 
quantities and prices of commodities, repairs, interest, refunds, 
bond payments, etc., and the confusion of thought in handling such 
a conglomerate, — and we begin to appreciate the possibilities 
of mechanical tabulation and its superlative advantages. 
III. Seconpary TaBuLATION 
The future chapters. In Chapter II the initial steps in 
the study of an educational problem were shown to be the 
careful definition of the problem and the collection and origi- 
nal tabulation of the educational data. These were to be 
followed by the systematic classification of the data in the 
frequency distribution, and its summarization by means of 
various analytic and graphic methods. The discussion of the 
checking method pointed out that systematic planning of 
column headings for the original tables really amounted to

the statistical classifcation of the facts. The principles and 
methods controlling this work are treated in detail in Chap- 
ter IV. The succeeding chapters, V to IX inclusive, take up 
the remaining steps in the statistical treatment of facts. 
In a fashion, they may all be called Secondary Tabulation. 
Chapter V presents the various methods of typifying 
data by “averages.”’ Chapter VI shows how the data may 
be represented somewhat more completely by measures 
of “variability.” Chapter VII discusses the methods of 
graphic representation of educational facts, and their connec- 
tion with ideal frequency curves. Chapter VIII shows the 
application of such type curves to practical educational 
problems. In Chapter IX will be given a complete discus- 
sion of ways and means of determining the possibility and 
degree of relationship that exists between various aspects 
of school work. ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  CHAPTER IV 
STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF EDUCATIONAL DATA: 
THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION 
I. Inrropuctory 
Statistics of attributes and variables. The study of the 
quantitative problems with which we deal in education re- 
veals two principal statistical methods of treating the meas- 
urement of human traits: (1) the method of “attributes’’; 
and (2) the method of “variables.” The measurement of 
human traits may vary in refinement all the way from the 
mere counting of the presence or absence of a trait (treated 
by the method of attributes) to the rather minute quanti- 
tative measurement of the trait (better treated by the 
method of variables). The grouping of individuals accord- 
ing to the presence or absence of a trait may be illustrated 
by: the counting of the number of pupils in a class that have 
passed or not passed; the number that are of normal men- 
tality, or are mentally deficient; the number that have light 
hair or dark hair, are tall or short, blind or seeing, sane or 
insane, and so on. The methods by which we would treat 
statistics collected in this way have been denoted by Yule, 
“THE STATISTICS OF ATTRIBUTES,” and they are 
to be thought of as somewhat distinct from the methods of 
treating statistics collected by more refined methods of 
measurement. These latter, which are known as the “STA- 
TISTICS OF VARIABLES,” imply that the specific mag- 
nitude of the trait has been measured with reference to a 
scale made up of known units. In general the statistics 
gathered in educational research are those of measurable 
traits, i.e., the statistics of variables. For example, we can
-P-A-G-E-95
STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DATA 15 
  measure, in a fairly refined way, the ability of pupils in 
arithmetic, or in algebra; the mental age of children; the cost 
of teaching various subjects of study; the retardation of 
pupils in the public school, and so on. We should have 
clearly in mind therefore that the statistical methods with 
which we treat one kind of statistics — those of attributes 
— may be different from those with which we treat the other 
kind — those of variables. The term variable as used in this 
book may be taken to mean a varying quantity or human 
trait, — for example, arithmetic ability, teaching skill, the 
height of men, etc. Thus, these traits are subject to statisti- 
cal study by either mere enumeration or counting methods, 
or may be subject to fairly accurate measurement. 
II. Cuassrrication or SratisticaL Data 
Grouping of data into classes. Whatever may be the 
method by which, or the degree of refinement with which 
data are collected, when we turn to their organization so that 
we may interpret the situations that they represent, we face 
the problem of “ grouping.” Clear thinking about large num- 
bers of facts neeegsitates the condensation and organization 
of the data in systematic form. That is, we are forced to 
group our data in “classes,” and the statistical treatment of 
the data depends upon the determination of these “classes.” 
A statistical CLASS, whether of attributes or of variables, 
may be illustrated by Tables 5 and 6.! They picture the re- 
lation that exists, for example (Table 5) between the peda- 
gogical standing and the mental standing of school children. 
To do this, the pedagogical ages of the children in question 
are grouped in three classes, — “retarded,” “normal,” and 
“advanced,’’—and the mental ages according to whether 
they are “retarded,” “‘at level” (i.c., normal) and “ad- 
1 From Stern's Psychological Methods of Testing Intelligence, pp. 59 and 61.
-P-A-G-E-96
16 STATISTICAL METHODS 
vanced.” Corresponding to thissame classification of mental 
age, Table 6 “‘groups”’ the pupils in three classes according 
to whether their school marks were poor, satisfactory, or 
good. Thus the 14 pupils ‘“‘retarded” in both pedagogical 
age and mental age form a “‘class”’; 16 that were “normal” 
in pedagogical age and “retarded” in mental age form an- 
other “class.’”’ Or, turning to the “total”? columns, in the 
entire group of 101 there are found: a class of 24 pupils re- 
tarded, 65 pupils normal, and 12 pupils advanced. Because 
of the fact that refined quantitative methods were not em- 
ployed in classifying the records we call these data, “‘STA- 
TISTICS OF ATTRIBUTES.”

  - STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DATA 77 
Suppose, however, that the standing of the 216 pupils 
represented in Table 7, instead of being grouped as poor, 
satisfactory, and good, had been given in terms of numerical 
marks on a 100 per cent scale, say, — 87, 82, 54, 76, 91, ete. 
It will be clear that the grouping of these data now neces- 
sitates setting definite numerical limits to the classes in 
which the various measures (individual marks), are going to 
fall. Now, instead of being called poor, satisfactory, good, the 
marks will be found to fall within some definite interval of 
the scale, 85.0 to 89.99; 80.0 to 84.99; 50.0 to 54.99; 75.0 to 
79.99; 90.0 to 94.99, etc. Our data thus illustrate again the 
STATISTICS OF VARIABLES, and point out the differ- 
ences between the method of treating such measures and the 
ATTRIBUTES represented in Stern’s tables. 
Distribution on scales. This discussion of the grouping of 
measures has made use of several important concepts, which 
must be clearly grasped by the student. Fundamental to 
the practice of measurement are the concepts of SCALE 
and UNIT. We shall think always of mental and social 
measurements as distributed over a “scale”? — i.e., a linear 
distance or a difference in numerical magnitude which will 
represent or stand for the magnitude of the measures in 
question. 
For example, the ability of a group of children in hand- 
writing may vary in magnitude, let us say, from 40 to 75, 
when measured on a total scale of ‘handwriting merit,” 
such as is given in the Scale for Measuring Handwriting, 
devised by Dr. L. P. Ayres, from 20 to 90. 
Scholastic abilities are measured, very generally, by the 
percentile marks of teachers, which are taken to represent 
the relative position of pupils on a one hundred per cent scale. 
The per-pupil costs of teaching the various high-school sib- 
jects may be pictured clearly as distributed over a ‘‘cost- 
scale.” The scale may be pictured in numerical or graphic

Manifold classification. In distinction from the rough 
grouping of attributes illustrated above, this numerical . 
classification of measures is called “‘ manifold-classification.” 
The student should be cautioned that the classes should be 
clearly marked off from each other by definite numerical 
limits, 50.0-54.99; 55.0-59.99; or 47.5-52.49; 52.5-57.49, 
etc., if the class-interval is to contain, for example, five 
units. There are three different ways in which the limits may 
be set to the intervals on the scale: 
The first method of setting class limits is to give the limits 
themselves, as: 5.0-9.99; 10.0-14.99; 15.0-19.99, etc., as 
is given in Diagram 17. The student, in beginning the 
tabulation of frequency distributions, is advised to make use 
of this definite method, clearly distinguishing the position 
of the intervals. Especially is it a helpful devise in increasing 
the accuracy of tabulation. The use of the method 5-10; 
10-15; 15-20, etc., leads to many errors in tabulation. The 
routine statistical work should be safeguarded at every pos- 
sible step. Clear marking off of class-intervals will tend to 
reduce errors in this particular. 
The second method of setting class limits is to express the 
interval in terms of the mid-value of the class-interval; for 
example: 7.5; 12.5; 17.5. From the standpoint of accuracy in 
tabulating the frequencies this is a very poor method, and 
leads to many errors in tabulation. 
The third method is to state the interval in words in the 
form, “5 and less than 10”; “10 and less than 15”; “15 and 
less than 20,”’ etc. As cautioned above, the use of the same
-P-A-G-E-101
  STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DATA 81 
numbers in expressing the numerical limits of class-intervals, 
10, 15, 20, etc., and the complication of the word-heading 
leads to error. It should be clear that, at least for the novice 
in statistical work, class-intervals should be defined very 
carefully. Students consistently make more mistakes in the 
routine tabulation of measures than in the computation of 
means, measures of variability, etc., after the data have 
been arranged. 
IV. Tus Frequency Distripution: THe Steps IN 
ITs CONSTRUCTION 
Arranging a frequency distribution. The grouping or clas- 
sifying of measures consists, therefore, (1) in noting the 
length of the range, i.e., the distance between the largest 
and the smallest measures; (2) in deciding on the number of 
class-intervals (or, the size of a class-interval) into which 
you are to divide the total range of the measures; (3) set- 
ting the position of the class-intervals (i.e., determining the 
specific class-limits); and (4) tabulating the FREQUENCY 
of occurrence of the measures in each of the class-intervals. 
The result of such grouping of measures is called a ““FRE- 
QUENCY DISTRIBUTION,” and is made up of two 
columns of figures, first a serial list of the “ CLASS-INTER- 
VALS,” arranged preferably with the smaller measures at 
the lower end of the scale; second, a column of “‘ frequencies,” 
which gives the number of measures tabulated in each class 
interval. Tables 7 and 8! give illustrations of the fre- 
quency distribution as it is used in the study of educational 
problems, and which make use of the method of defining 
class-limits very carefully.

The first step in constructing the frequency distribution. 
To make clear the construction of the frequency distribution
-P-A-G-E-103
  STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DATA 83 
let us work through a problem with the following illustrative 
data. Table 9 gives the “original measures,” — in this 
case, the marks given to 123 pupils in English. Running 
down each of the columns we note that the lowest mark given 
was 20; the highest, 95. Thus the range is 75. In the treat- 
ment of these data our aim is to classify them in such a way 
that, for example, an “average,” computed for the data 
in the classified or condensed form, will be very closely the 
same as the “ true average,” which would be computed from 
the entire list of the original measures themselves.

  The second step in constructing the frequency distribu- 
tion. This is: deciding on the number of class-intervals into 
which the range shall be divided; 7.c., how many units on 
the scale shall be included in one class-interval. Two ques- 
tions have to be answered: — 
(1) How large may the class-interval be made and still 
give reasonably small errors in the computation of “aver- 
ages,” etc. The larger we make the interval — that is, the 
more greatly measures are condensed — the more do we 
cut down our labor of arithmetic computation. In an ex- 
tensive investigation, which includes many frequency dis- 
tributions made up from data that show similar characteris-
-P-A-G-E-104
  84 STATISTICAL METHODS 
tics as to variation, it may be feasible to take the time to 
group the data in several different frequency-distributions, 
computing, say, some average value for each. If the student 
does so he will note that as he makes the size of class-inter- 
val smaller there will be an “optimum size”? beyond which 
further reduction will not give an increase of accuracy of the 
average. In most educational investigations, however, anem- 
pirical rule can be given to guide the student in his work. In 
general, when the units of the scale covered by the range are 
as few as 10, 15, or even 20, nothing is to be gained by group- 
ing the data in fewer classes, and we may let each unit repre- 
sent a class-interval. For example, in the problem given in 
Table 18 there are 12 different unit costs of teaching 
English, the frequency of the occurrence of each of which 
is given for 148 Kansas cities. The true mean may be rapidly 
computed without grouping. On the other hand, the 123 
class marks given in the foregoing problem cover a range 
of 75 units, and obviously must be grouped. A practical 
rule is to condense to not more than 20 intervals, and to 
choose a size that gives ease of tabulation. In this case 
class-intervals of 5 units convert a range of 75 units into 15 
class-intervals, a good working number. 
(2) In what ways are the measures concentrated around 
certain average values? For example, are most of the marks 
in the illustrative example grouped in the middle of the scale, 
with about the same number of measures on each side (that 
is, do they form a fairly “symmetrical” distribution), or are 
they widely scattered over the scale, each value occurring 
only a few times? This question can be answered roughly 
by careful inspection of the lists of original measures. If 
such inspection leads to the conclusion that the measures 
are fairly well concentrated, or are symmetrically dispersed 
over the scale, the particular method of grouping will not 
cause a fluctuation in the value of the “average” or the
-P-A-G-E-105
  STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DATA 85 
“measure of variability” that is computed from the fre- 
quency distribution. 
Fundamental assumption underlying grouping. There is 
one fundamental assumption that we make in all “group- 
ing” of measures in a frequency distribution, namely, that 
all the values in any class-interval are concentrated at the 
mid-point of the interval, and may be represented by the 
value of this mid-point. For example, if the data of Table 
9 were grouped in class-intervals of 5 per cent, as in 73.0- 
77.99; 78.0-82.99; etc., then the values of 74, 73, 75, 76, 77 
all fall within the interval 73.0-77.99, and for all practical 
purposes are each assumed to be equal to the mid-value, 
75.5. It will be clear that, with very unsymmetrical dis- 
tributions, the assumption is untenable as large errors of 
computation come about. For example in the cost prob- 
lem on page 116, grouping the original distribution in class 
intervals of 2 makes at the low end of the range a very ma- 
terial error in the first interval, one city actually having a 
per-pupil recitation cost of one cent, and 26 cities a cost of 
two cents, the “grouping” causing us to assume that 27 
cities each have a cost of 1.5 cents. The error in computing 
the “average,” due to this assumption, is partly compen- 
sated for, however, by the next interval in which are com- 
bined 46 measures at three cents, and 26 measures at four 
cents, offsetting in part the “skewing” of the average toward 
the low end of the scale. In some educational investiga- 
tions the data are either so scattered, or are concentrated 
unsymmetrically, — more heavily at one end of the scale, — 
that it is necessary to be cautious about grouping. It should 
be pointed out that with most educational measurements 
the data are concentrated fairly near the middle of the scale, 
and tend to be fairly symmetrical. This is a fortunate con- 
dition, and makes relatively easy for the student the problem 
of grouping his data. In general he may accept it as a rule,
-P-A-G-E-106
  86 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  for guiding the preparation of frequency distributions, that 
he should get a working number of class-intervals, say from 
10 to 20, but at the same time should make the interval as 
small as is necessary to reveal any particularly predominant 
points on the scale. 
Summary as to class-intervals. Summing up the fore- 
going statements on the question of deciding the number of 
class-intervals, we see that the class-interval must be made 
as large as is possible, and at the same time give relatively 
slight error in computation from the frequency distribution; 
that the intervals should not exceed approximately 20 in 
number, or, in general, be less than 10; that the grouping 
can be done much more completely if the measures are con- 
centrated fairly near the middle of the range, and are dis- 
tributed in a somewhat symmetrical manner on both sides 
of this general point of concentration; that in all grouping 
we make the very important assumption that all measures 
in a class-interval are grouped at the mid-point of the inter- 
val, and are equal to it in value, and that this assumption is 
pertinent to the determination of the size of the interval, the 
larger and more unsymmetrical the distribution of measures 
in the interval the greater the error made in makirig the 
assumption. ‘ 
Third step in constructing the frequency distribution — 
determining the position of the class-intervals. In dividing 
up the range into class-intervals we are forced to decide at 
what digits to set the numerical limits of the intervals, — 
50.0, 55.0, or 47.5, 52.5, 57.5, or 58, 58, 63, ete. Two criteria 
control this decision: First, the interval should be set at 
such points on the scale as will lead to the greatest ease and 
accuracy of tabulation. The experience of the writer and 
his students leads to the belief that to satisfy this criterion, 
intervals should not only start and stop with digits, but 
should make use of the basic tens system wherever pos-

sible. Thus the measures given in Table 10, Classifications 
Tand II, make use of this method, — 50.0-54.99; 55.0-59.99; 
60.0-64.99, etc. The second criterion has to do with the 
later manipulation of the measures in the frequency dis- 
tributions, — such as is required in the working of the 
weighted arithmetic mean. Such computation requires the 
multiplication of the frequencies by the mid-points of the 
class-intervals. To cut down the arithmetic labor involved 
in this process would seem to demand that the mid-point be 
an integer, — for example, 55, 60, 65, 70, etc. Classifications 
I, II, I, and IV of the data in Table 10 illustrate the differ- 
ences in the computation with the mid-points at integral 
and decimal points. 
The later discussion of the computation of averages and 
variability shows, however, that the actual multiplication 
may all be reduced to mental processes (by the use of short 
methods). For this reason the second criterion should not 
hold in deciding on the position of class-intervals. It is the 
writer’s judgment that accuracy and rapidity of tabulation 
should guide the student, and cause him to use that classi- 
fication of limits for his intervals that bring about the most 
rapid and most accurate tabulation. It is recommended that 
for distributions covering a large pcrtion of the percentile 
range, intervals of 5 be used, and that their limits be set at 
20.0, 25.0, 30.0, 35.0, ete. 
V. Tut Grapuic REPRESENTATION or EDUCATIONAL

Importance of graphic representation. The fundamental 
aim of all statistical organization of educational data is to 
secure clear interpretation of the situation represented by 
the data. The numerical classification of large numbers of 
facts in the frequency distribution is certainly the first im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
     
88 STATISTICAL METHODS 
portant step in condensing the original measures so that the 
mind can deal clearly with them. It will be shown in the 
next two chapters that there are two major numerical 
methods of further condensing the material, — the method 
of “ averages,” and the method of “‘ variability.”’ Each of the 
methods condenses the facts of the frequency distribution 
into a single number, and aids materially in the interpre- 
tation of the data. But thorough use can be made of such 
measures only by the most experienced manipulator of 
statistical methods. The student needs still more concrete 
methods of representing facts. Probably the greatest aid to 
sound interpretation of statistical data will come from the 
graphic representation of the facts in question. At this point, 
then, it will be well to take up a brief discussion of the 
plotting of frequency distributions. 
Representing a frequency distribution. There are two 
principal methods of representing a frequency distribution 
by a graph: (1) that which gives the FREQUENCY POLY- 
GON; and (2) that which gives the HISTOGRAM or 
COLUMN DIAGRAM. The two methods are illustrated by 
Diagrams 20 and 21, which graphically represent the data 
of Table 10, in three different classifications. In both types 
the horizontal base line represents the scale along which the 
class-intervals of the frequency distribution are laid off. 
The class-intervals are laid off on this scale by making use 
of the largest “unit” that the width of the paper will permit. 
The vertical lines represent the number of measures found to 
fall in a particular class-interval or at a particular point on 
the scale. 
General directions for plotting. All graphing is done on 
two basic lines or axes. Using our established notation we 
may call these OX and OY. Keeping the accepted alge- 
braic methods of graphing we shall lay off all units on the 
horizontal scale from left to right, and all units on the     
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DATA 89 
vertical scale from bottom to top. Doing this, as in Dia- 
gram 18, the steps in making the frequency polygon are 
these: — 
1. Note the numerical amount of the range of the fre- 
quency distribution. 
2. Lay off the units of the frequency distribution on the 
base line OX. Make the units as large as possible and yet 
get all of the distribution on 
one piece of paper. Obviously 
the selection of units must be 
left to the judgment of the 
draftsman. Mark clearly the 
limits of the class-intervals on 
the base line.

been found to fall within that 
class-interval. If your data are definite integral records, 
varying by units of one each, such as the number of prob- 
lems solved by large numbers of pupils in arithmetic, — say, 
10 solving 5, 14 solving 6, 72 solving 7, 158 solving 8, 49 
solving 9, 10 solving 10, etc., — then draw the vertical lines 
representing the number of individuals at these definite unit 
points, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. No grouping of records is done, 
and no assumption is made that the measures are concen- 
trated at the mid-point of the class-interval. 
Size of unit. The selection of the size of the “unit” in 
laying off the number of measures on the vertical lines is 
arbitrary. Two principles of construction should control it 
however: (1) The units should be made large enough that 
the whole distribution may be pictured on one graph — the
-P-A-G-E-114
90 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  size of the paper chosen will determine this point. (2) The 
units must be large enough to make very clear the charac- 
teristic features of the distribution. This means that the 
horizontal and vertical scales shall be so taken that the 
polygon is sufficiently “steep” to indicate distinct changes 
in the distribution of the data. Especially is this true of 
graphs which picture rates of increase, in which case we 
should avoid using a small scale, which will result in a very 
““flat”’ polygon. 
The student should be directed to indicate very clearly 
on the graph: (1) the limits of the class-intervals; (2) the 
distribution of the units along the vertical axis OY. 
The frequency polygon. Diagrams 19, 20, and 21 illus- 
trate the plotting of the frequency-distribution for two kinds 
of records: (1) ungrouped measures expressed in integral 
units; (2) measures grouped in class-intervals. The measures 
for the first illustration are arranged in the frequency dis- 
tribution, shown in Table 11. Such a table is then plotted 
as is shown in Diagram 19.

should be reminded again of the fundamental assumption 
underlying this method, namely: the values of all meas- 
ures in the class-interval are assumed to be equal to the 
mid-value of the interval, and in plotting are actually con- 
centrated at this mid-value. An important corollary to the

in the frequency distribution is equal, to scale, to the total 
length of all the vertical distances laid off above the mid- 
points of the class-intervals.

stated above for the plotting of frequency polygons repre-

the base of the rectangle equal to the length of the class- 
interval, and the altitude equal (to the chosen scale) to the 
number of measures in that class-interval. (Diagram 21.) 
It will be clear that such plotting of measures makes the 
definite assumption that measures are distributed uniformly 
throughout the interval. This assumption is to be contrasted 
with the one made in the case of thé frequency polygon, — 
namely, that all measures in the class-interval are concen- 
trated at the mid-point of the interval. 
Plotting of this kind has to do with a definite and gen- 
erally fairly small number of measurements which have been 
made, in educational research, with rather rough measuring 
instruments. With the development of very refined meth- 
ods of measuring, and the collection of a large number of 
measures, the measures would be found to vary from each 
other by very small amounts. Furthermore, human measure- 
ments, when compiled in large numbers, point to the fact 
that the numbers of measures at consecutive points on 
the scale are closely the same. That is, as we increase the 
accuracy of measurement and the number of observations, 
the mid-points of our class-intervals move more and more 
closely together. Furthermore, the tops of the ordinates 
erected at these points tend to form a continuous curve, 
instead of a polygon of broken lines. This curve we speak of 
then, as a FREQUENCY CURVE, and the total area be- 
tween the curve and the base line represents the total number of 
measures. This is important for the student to hold in mind 
in connection with the later graphic treatment of measures. 
It will be evident that the area under the frequency poly- 
gon represents very inadequately the number of measures in 
the distribution, in those cases in which the number is 
small and the range is relatively large. In such cases it is 
suggested that the column diagram be drawn, as typifying 
more clearly, by its area, the true status of the measures.

THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 
Tue First Meruop or pEscripine A FREQUENCY 
DistriBuTion 
1. General statement of methods of describing a frequency- 
distribution 
Measures of condensation and, organization. Having 
discussed the method of organizing material in the form of a 
frequency distribution, we are now prepared to take up the 
consideration of methods of statistically treating the distri- 
bution. It seems clear that the organization of the material 
in serial class arrangement, as in a frequency distribution, is 
but a preliminary step to the definite quantitative treatment 
of the material itself. The frequency distribution with its 
accompanying diagrams may represent adequately the 
status of the numerical data. It does not, however, enable 
definite comparison of its central tendency (e¢.g., the “aver- 
age”) with that of the typical status (the “average’’) of. 
other distributions. To make these comparisons, to be 
able to portray the typical numerical situation concisely and 
completely, we need measures of condensation and organiza- 
tion. There are three principal methods of typifying fre-, 
quency distributions that will aid in comparison. 
Central tendency and variability. The first method is 
the method of averages or of “central tendency ”’; 7.¢., the 
method that shows how distributions differ-in position, as 
shown by the size of the measure around which the measures 
largely cluster. The second method is, method of varia- 
bility; i.e, the method that indicates the way in which
-P-A-G-E-122
   
   98 STATISTICAL METHODS 
the separate measures of two distributions, “spread,” or 
“fluctuate,” around the “average.” It is clearly not suffi- 
cient to be able to compare the status of two distributions 
by stating their average value. The average value may be 
and often is a deceptive value for use in comparative work. 
In fact, any one 
statistical measure 
will probably be an 
inadequate means 
of fully describing 
any group of data. 
Thisisclearly shown 
by the frequency 
curves drawn in Di- 
agram 22, in which

tions is identical,

trative case it would be quite incorrect to infer from the 
identity of the average standing of the two classes that the 
distributions of abilities are equal. In this case at least we 
need a measure which will enable us to compare the variation 
of ability in the two classes about the average ability of each. 
The method of relationship. The third method of treat- 
ing frequency distributions is the method of relationship. For 
example, we need to know how one type of ability is related 
to another type of ability; how one type of activity “cor- 
responds” to, or “correlates” with, another; what effect one 
type of learning has on another type; how ability in mathe- 
matics is related to ability in languages, etc., etc.       lean Median

  THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 99 
Throughout the discussion of the use of averages and 
measures of variability we should have in mind the fact 
that for an adequate comprehension of the status of a group 
of numerical data one needs to study and interpret the whole 
distribution. Averages, and variability measures, and meas- 
ures of relationship are but means of representing central 
tendency by statements of the most probable value of the 
measure in question. For example, the arithmetic mean 
(the commonly used “average’’) may be said to be the “ most 
probable value of a series of measures.” The value of the corre- 
lation coefficient, “7” (.17, .83, .42, or what-not) may be 
said to be only a statement of the most probable value of the 
degree of relationship which exists between the two traits in 
question. If it were said that the coefficient of correlation, 
“»”? for the relationship that exists between scholastic ability 
in mathematics and that in languages, is .70, we should be 
able to use this value of .70 as a statement of the probability 
that as “ability in language”? increases, so does “ability in 
mathematics’’ tend to increase. That is, that pupils high in 
mathematics tend to be high in languages. It is desired to 
emphasize this precaution against the wholesale acceptance 
of statistical devices, and to point out the need for a thorough 
tabulation of the original data in such complete fashion 
that detailed study and interpretation may be made of the 
raw material. With this brief preliminary statement we shall 
turn at once to the treatment of the problem of “averages.” 
2. Discussion of averages used in educational research 
Averages describe frequency distributions by pointing 
out central tendencies. The attempt to describe a classi- 
fication of educational data by a single number must be an 
arbitrary process. The student thrown on his own resources 
and forced to invent a way of typifying a distribution 
would doubtless hit upon one of the several accepted ways
-P-A-G-E-124
100 STATISTICAL METHODS 
of doing that. Suppose that he had plotted a frequency 
polygon from his data, as in Diagram 19, and had raised the 
questions — What is the most evident “central tendency” 
of these data? What is their most. characteristic or typical 
feature? It is evident that the most outstanding charac- 
teristic is shown by the high point or peak existing in the 
frequency polygon. Since the height of the vertical ordi- 
nate in each case represents the number of measures, this 
high point means that a larger number of pupils solved 
eight problems correctly than any other particular number 
of problems. The corresponding point on the scale, then, 
may be called: — 5 
I. Tat Mops 
First method of pointing out central tendencies. The mode 
is simply that value on the scale which occurs most fre- 
quently. It is clear that we have here a rough device for 
indicating the typical tendency of a mass of data. The value 
that occurs the most frequently obviously points out cen- 
tral tendencies, provided a large enough number of meas- 
ures is included in the frequency distribution to make it a 
representative or “random” sample of the total group. 
We shall clear up the question of “sampling” in a later 
chapter, but may point out now that the number of meas- 
ures in a distribution is large enough to form a “random 
sample” when it reaches such a number that the addition of 
another similar group of measures will not cause a fluctua- 
tion in the magnitude of the “‘average”’ that is computed 
from it. Under such a condition, the mode roughly typifies 
the distribution in question. 
The student should recognize two distinct problems arising 
in connection with the use of the mode in interpreting his 
data. (1) It may be used only as an approximate “ inspec-
-P-A-G-E-125
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 101 
tion” average. Inspection of the frequency polygon re- 
veals the modal value (or modal values if there should prove 
to be more than one distinct peak in the polygon). This 
specific modal value, which is the mid-value of the class- 
interval that contains the largest number of measures, 
depends — within a certain range over the scale — upon the 
size and position of class-intervals. To a considerable extent, 
with distributions of limited numbers of cases, and with 
distributions decidedly unsymmetrical in shape, this crude 
inspection mode is an unstable average. On the whole we 
should caution against using it for any purpose except as a 
very rough aid in the preliminary inspection of the fre- 
quency distribution, as an aid in “characterizing the type,” 
— picking out summit points and central tendencies in the 
frequency curve. 
(2) The term ‘“‘mode’’ should be technically reserved for 
the ‘theoretical mode” (introduced by Professor Karl 
Pearson in 1902), which is thoroughly mathematical in its 
origin. It was noted above that the mid-value of the class- 
interval containing the largest frequency depends upon the 
selection of the size and position of class-intervals. It should 
be emphasized that the larger part of our statistical work in 
school research is done on a distinctly limited number of 
measures, and with unrefined measuring instruments. If we 
will postulate the increase of the number of measures to a 
number relatively large, and an increasing refinement of the 
measurement itself, then the frequency polygon (or column 
diagram), which we draw to represent our actual recorded 
data, may be said to approach continually a “continuous” 
or “‘ideal’’ frequency curve as a limit. That is, the smooth 
frequency curve (for example, Diagram 23, from the data 
of Table 11) represents the ideal situation, — the law that 
would be obtained by refined measurement of a very large 
number of cases. \  
-P-A-G-E-126
      102 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Practically, however, we cannot attain to sufficiently re- 
fined measurement of an infinitely large number of cases, 
and we have to content ourselves with a theoretical fitting

the advanced theory of curve-fitting, the thorough under- 
standing of which implies a considerable amount of mathe- 
matical training. Thus, the discussion of the calculation of

the “true mode”’ is clearly beyond the scope of the present 
work.! 
Pearson’s empirical rule for calculating mode. Fortu- 
nately, most of our distributions in educational research are 
but “moderately skewed,” — that is, the measures are 
largely concentrated somewhere near the central portion of 
the range. For such distributions (for example Diagram 23, 
from data on Table 12) Pearson has given us an em- 
pirical rule for quickly calculating an approximation to 
this mode, which will very closely approach the true mode. 
It depends, however, on the previous computation of the 
arithmetic mean and the median. (These averages will be 
taken up next in this discussion.) This may be expressed 
as: — 
The mode = Mean — 8 (mean —median). 
That is, with moderately unsymmetrical distributions the 
median, mean, and mode stand in such a relation that 
the median is always about one third of the distance from 
the mean towards the mode. Applying this to our illustra- 
tion in Diagram 20 we find, mean = 72.6; median = 75.64; 
difference between them = 8.04. . Therefore the approxi- 
mate mode is 81.72. 
To give an estimate of the closeness with which the mode 
calculated by the use of this empirical relation approaches 
the “true” mode we give on page 104 two tables from Yule.

method of pointing out central tendencies in a distribution, 
the second is plain: find some pertinent middle value. Such 
a value is the median, defined rigorously as that point on the 
scale of the frequency distribution, on each side of which one 
half of the measures falls. It will be helpful to the student 
to do his thinking strictly in terms of the linear scale which 
represents the frequency distribution. The completeness 
with which the student refers to a scale all of his work with 
frequency distributions will be determined largely by the

lems in averaging. 
Continuous series of measures. First — we have to do 
with two distinctly different kinds of measures in educational

_ which the quantities are subject to any degree of division. 
For example, the arithmetical ability of a class of boys, as 
shown by the scores made on tests or by their class marks; 
their heights, weights and other anthropometrical measure- 
ments; in fact nearly all anthropometrical and social attri- 
butes such as we meet in educational research. We shall 
comment in detail in a later chapter on the form of the dis- 
tribution of such human traits, but we may point out here, 
in order to illustrate the point of the discussion, that most 
human measurements have been found to conform roughly 
to some such smooth curve as is given in Diagram 24, Fig. 2. 
The base line of this curve represents, in each ease, the 
status of the trait in question, for a very large number of 
persons. The method of testing such ability results in inte- 
gral scores, it is true, but in each case these integral scores 
represent the mid-values of various class-intervals on the scale. 
For example, Tables 14 and 15 give the scores obtained 
by two groups of eleven pupils in a test for ability in 
factoring. 
Each of these scores, 24, 23, 22, etc., means that the pupil 
had solved 24, or 23, or 22 problems, and was working on the 
next. That is, we let the integral score 22, for example, 
represent a distance in the scale, say the distance (or class- 
interval) from 21.5 to 22.5, or from 22.0 to 22.99. We spoke 
of it, in the previous chapter, as the mid-value of the class- 
interval. Thus we see that such measures form continuous 
series, — that if we refine our methods of testing we will 
get scores of 22.1, 22.2, etc., instead of 22, 23, 24. 
Discontinuous series of measures. On the other hand, 
although most of our measurements are of the foregoing type, 
we do meet discontinuous series in our study of educational 
problems. For example, all our records of attendance contain 
gaps, — whether by classes, schools, or grades; the salary 
schedules of teachers contain distinct gaps, — we advance

  teachers by jumps of $25.00, or $50.00, or $1090.00, etc. It 
should be clear, however, that for purposes of pointing out 
central tendencies these measures may best be distributed 
along a scale and grouped, each group thus representing a 
distance on the “salary scale.” 
The second definite problem that has to be clear to the stu- 
dent who wishes to grasp sound methods of “averaging” 
takes account, first, of the differences in proper methods to 
use in the case of small numbers of measures, as opposed to 
large numbers, and, second, of the shape of the frequency 
distribution. This latter point takes account of the degree 
to which the measures are concentrated at different points 
on the scale, — whether near the middle or at the extreme 
ends. The two points must, however, be discussed together. 
With small numbers of measures (perhaps 10 to 20 or 
30), and anything but a very symmetrical distribution over 
a fairly short range, the wisdom of using any average to 
typify the measures is questionable. Rather than do this, 
the whole distribution should be presented and discussed in 
detail. Furthermore, the form of the distribution or the way 
in which the measures are concentrated at particular points 
on the scale may render any single measure decidedly ficti- 
tious. For example, suppose that the distribution showed 
a large proportion of measures largely concentrated at the 
very end of the range, but with decided numbers scattered 
throughout the entire range. The attempt to find some one 
typical measure to point out the central tendency of these 
measures must result in a partially fictitious statement of 
affairs. On the other hand, with the distribution of algebra 
scores shown in Diagram 19, a middle value, say 8, in 
Table 11, typifies the group very well. So, in turning to the 
discussion of the finding of the median, a central-most value, 
we should take up the discussion with a full recognition of 
the limitations of such single measures in typifying distri- 
butions of certain kinds.
-P-A-G-E-133
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 109 
  We said that the mode was an “inspectional average.” 
In the same way, the median is a counting average. Its de- 
termination includes two steps: (1) the arrangement of the 
measures in serial or rank order, placing the largest one first 
and the smallest one last or vice-versa; (2) the counting in 
of the measures from one end to determine the point on 
each side of which half of the measures fall. The specific 
computation of the median depends upon whether the meas- 
ures are arranged in a simple series or in a grouped fre- 
quency distribution. 
Computation of the median 
(A) With the measures in a simple series. By a simple 
series we mean a distribution of values on a scale, each of 
which values occurs once. Thus Tables 14 and 15 give 
simple series of an odd number of measures, 11. In 
Table 14 it is clear that the middle-most measure, the 
sixth (19) is the median of the series, regardless of whether 
we define the median carefully as the point on'the scale on 
each side of which there is an equal number of cases, or 
as the middle measure. Many people have been defining 
the median as the middle-most measure in the series. Ob- 
viously if we add a twelfth measure (say one case of 13 prob- 
lems in Table 14) we now have no middle measure. We 
are forced to assume that the median is the value half-way 
between 18 and 19, or 18.5. This latter way of defining the 
median assumes that the median is the (N + 1)th measure 
2 
Stee ees eT 6th measure). We shall define 
it throughout this discussion as a point on the scale on each 
side of which N/2 measures are found to fall. 
Table 14 therefore offers no very real difficulty in typi- 
fying the distribution, — the measures are uniformly dis-  
-P-A-G-E-134
110 STATISTICAL METHODS 
tributed by units of one. In Table 15, however, the 11 meas- 
ures are scattered over a wider range. Now the middle 
measure is 10, the median under the N +1 definition. 
zg 
Adding a measure, say 21, makes our total 12, with no

way between 10 and 16. It should, of course, be stressed 
that with 11 measures, any “‘average” is a questionable 
measure of central tendency. ! 
(B) With the measures grouped in a frequency distribu- 
tion. As the number of measures becomes larger (30 or 40, 
perhaps, and upward) we are forced to group our measures 
in a frequency-distribution. For purposes of computing the 
median we now make an important assumption: the meas- 
ures in any class-interval are distributed uniformly through- 
out the interval, but may be represented by the value of the 
mid-point. The computation may now be illustrated by the 
___ distribution in Table 16.

the median point on the scale. It is found to fall at a point 
in the interval, 3.5/28ths of the distance from 85.0 to 80.0. 
In numerical terms, then, the median is: 85.0 — 3.5/28 X 5 
= 85.0 — 0.63 = 84.37. 
The same result is obtained working up from the bottom 
of the scale. Thus, class-intervals, 40.0-44.99 to '75.0-79.99 
inclusive (or from 40.0 to 80.0) contain 120 measures. We
-P-A-G-E-136
112 STATISTICAL METHODS 
wish the point on the scale on each side of which there are 
144.5 cases. Therefore we need to go up into the class-in- 
terval 80.0-84.99, 24.5/28ths of the entire distance in the 
intervals. In units on the scale this means 24.5/28 X 5 added 
to 80.0, which is the value of the lower limit of the scale, 
= 84.37 as before. 
It will be noted that, to define the median as the point 
on the scale on each side of which there are N/2 measures, 
makes it possible to compute the median from either end of 
the scale and secure a constant value. This calls attention to 
the fact that the definition of the median as the (NV + 1/2)th 
measure leads to inconsistent results. For example, in the 
computation of the following simple problem: — 
Class-interval Frequency f 
20.0-24.99 2} 40

  Working from the 20-25 class-interval downward the me- 
dian equals: — 
15.0— as X 5=15 — 1.879 = 18.621 
Working upwards from the 0-5 class, the median is: — 
10.0+ — xX 5 = 104 3.793 = 13.793 
Thus, computing the median from one end of the distribu- 
tion gives 13.621; from the other, 13.793. The method used 
should give the same result, regardless of the direction of 
computation. It is suggested here that the student should 
always check his work by counting in from both ends of the
-P-A-G-E-137
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 113 
distribution. Using the method of computing the median, 
adopted here, the work checks up as follows: 
(a) Working from 20-25: median equals the point on the 
scale on each side of which there are N/2 or 47.5 measures. 
Therefore 
47.5 — 40 Md=15- 2 X 5 = 15-—1.30 = 13.70 
(b) Working upward from the bottom of the distribution: — 
5-6 Md= 104 23% x5 = 18.70 
  Summary of steps in computing median. In concluding 
the discussion of the median let us summarize the steps in ° 
its computation for the frequency distribution. 
First : compute N/2 measures. 
Second : Beginning at either end of the distribution, say the lower 
end, count the number of measures included in all class-intervals to 
the interval that contains the median. 
Third : From measures subtract the total number below the 
interval (obtained in step 2). This number of measures is the 
number that is needed to be included from the next interval to 
bring the computation to the median point on the scale. 
Fourth : Divide this remainder by the number of measures in this 
interval (containing the median). This is the proportion of the 
total measures in the interval that are needed to bring the com- 
putation to the median point. 
Fifth: Multiply this ratio by the number of units in a class- 
interval. The product is the number of units on the scale that need 
to be added to the value of the lower limit of the class-interval to 
give the median. 
Siath: Add this number to the value of the lower limit of the 
class-interval. This is the median point on the scale. Ease of 
computation and checking will be facilitated by expressing the 
value of the lower and upper limits of class-intervals as whole 
numbers, 80.0, 85.0, 90.0, etc., instead of 79.99, 84.99, 89.99, ete.

This whole process can be duplicated from the upper end 
of the scale by subtracting instead of by adding.

  Third method of pointing out central tendencies. We des- 
ignated our first method of pointing out central tenden- 
cies, the mode, as a rough “inspectional average”; our 
second method, the median, as a “‘counting average.” It is 
clear that either of these methods take account but indi- 
rectly of the VALUES of the measures in the distribution. 
That is, the mode is determined by the nwmber of measures 
that happen to be concentrated most largely at a certain 
point, — that is, the mode is a “position” average. Simi- 
larly, the median takes account of the actual VALUES of 
the measures only in their serial or rank order arrangement. 
The remaining steps in the computation of the median rec- 
ognize each measure equally with all other measures. For 
example, in Table 10, and Diagram 20, the extreme meas- 
ures of the distributions have equal weight with all other 
intermediate measures in the middle part of the range. 
We have definite need, however, for a measure of central 
tendency which will take account not only of the position of 
each of the measures, but also of their actual numerical value. 
Such a measure is the arithmetic mean, which is very gen- 
erally called the “average,” or “arithmetic average.” It 
should be pointed out here that the term “‘average”’ should 
be regarded as a class term which will include all of the vari- 
ous measures of central tendency that we are discussing in 
this chapter, and not as applying specifically to any one of 
them. :

THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 
Definition and computation of the arithmetic mean 
The arithmetic mean may be defined as the swm of the 
values of all the measures in the distribution, divided by the 
number of measures. Throughout this book we shall let M 
represent the arithmetic mean of the distribution, m repre- 
sent the value of any measure, and N the number of cases. 
Thus the formula for the arithmetic mean becomes 
=im 
eae 
  We must next make clear the distinctions which arise in 
connection with the problem of averaging by the arithme- 
tic mean, — namely, the computation of the simple and 
weighted arithmetic means, considered in connection with the 
distribution of measures, first, in the simple (ungrouped) 
series, and second, in the grouped frequency distribution. 
1. The computation of the arithmetic mean with the 
measures reported at their true values; i.e., in ungrouped 
or simple series. This may be illustrated by introducing the

It will be noted that the data of Table 17, although 
forming a simple series (each measure occurring at its actual 
value) also represent a simple frequency distribution, the 
frequency of each value being one. The arithmetic mean 
that is computed from such a series is a simple arithmetic 
mean. 
Table 18 also presents an illustration of the simple 
series, — that is, no grouping of measures has been done, 
and each measure appears at its true value. In this case,

however, we are dealing with a WEIGHTED frequency dis- 
tribution, because the frequency of occurrence of measures 
of any particular value is, in many cases, greater than one, —

The weighted arithmetic mean. The mean that is com- 
puted here is called a weighted arithmetic mean, because cer- 
tain values occur more frequently than others. In this 
case, however, the student should note that it is a true 
mean, just as the simple mean computed from the simple fre- 
quency distribution in Table 17 is a true mean. Further- 
«more, theoretically there is no difference in the principle 
underlying the computation of the simple mean and the 
weighted mean. In both, the value of each measure is mul- 
tiplied by the frequency of occurrence of that measure, the 
products are added, and the sum is divided by the number 
of measures. The expression for the weighted arithmetic 
mean now becomes: 
—2fm BAN, 
where m represents the numerical value of any measure, 
f the corresponding frequency of occurrence and N the 
total number of measures. In the actual computation of 
the simple mean we merely add the values of the separate 
measures, and divide by the number of measures. In Table 
17 each of the measures has been reported as having a 
frequency of 1, merely to make clear that there is no theo- 
retical difference between the simple and weighted mean, 
and that, with the former as well as with the latter case, in 
which the data consist of wngrowped measures, the com- 
putation results in a true mean. The computation of the 
weighted mean by multiplying the actual value of each 
measure by the corresponding frequency involves a large 
amount of numerical labor. It will be shown later that this

labor may be very materially cut down by a short method 
of computation, when dealing with either the simple or 
the weighted arithmetic mean. 
2. The computation of the arithmetic mean with the 
measures grouped in the frequency distribution. In the 
previous discussions we have noted that in grouping meas- 
ures in class-intervals we make two fundamental assump- 
tions, — (1) that the measures are distributed uniformly 
throughout the interval, and (2) that for computation pur- 
poses they are all numerically represented by the value of the 
mid-point of the class-interval. For the measures in Table 
18, the effect of this is illustrated by the following grouping 
of the measures: —

We note that grouping the classes of the original distribu- . 
tion in this fashion changes the ‘“‘average’’ cost per pupil 
recitation by five cents, a difference from the true mean of 
about one per,cent. With a more symmetrical or “skewed” 
distribution we would have found that grouping even
-P-A-G-E-143
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 119 
two consecutive intervals together would have affected 
the mean more considerably. With distributions that are 
fairly symmetrical, however, we see that the “grouping” 
of class-intervals changes the mean but slightly. The deci- 
sion as to grouping of data, size of class-interval, etc., must 
depend on the data in hand. In each, there is no need of 
further grouping. In the case of data like those given in 
Table 21, showing the distribution of the percentile effi- 
ciency of 365 students in a test for visual imagery, it would 
be a waste of time to compute the mean of the entire 
ungrouped distribution. Since we have a range of 100 per 
cent, it will be convenient to divide the distribution into 20 
class-intervals of five per cent each. The frequency distri- 
bution is then as given herewith in Table 21. 
Table 20 illustrates the effect of grouping on the size 
of the arithmetic mean and median, by giving results for 
the true mean computed from the 123 original measures 
of Table 9, p. 83, ungrouped, and the approximate mean 
for grouping these same measures in class-intervals of 
three units, five units, and ten units respectively. These 
results may be tabulated as follows: \

are seen to be but moderately skewed. For such a type of 
distribution it is clear that grouping the measures changes 
the “average,” either mean or median, relatively little. 
Table 21 gives the detailed computation of the arith- 
metic mean of the achievement of 365 college students 
in tests for visual imagery, by the traditional or LONG 
method. This method groups all measures in a class-interval 
at the mid-point. This example makes it clear that the 
computation of a mean by this method is unwieldy. Short 
methods of computation are therefore desirable.

3. Ashort method of computing the arithmetic mean. The 
short method to be presented to the student shortens the 
labor of multiplication by making three conditions: (1) that 
we treat the class-interval as a unit of 1 on the scale, in- 
stead of as an aggregation of many units; (2) that we assume 
the value of any measure or class-interval as the estimated 
mean, or as the one which contains the estimated mean; (3) 
that we compute the difference between the true mean and 
the estimated mean, rather than compute the true mean it- 
self. Let us illustrate it first by application to the simple 
series of cost data reported in Table 17.

122 STATISTICAL METHODS 
The practicableness of the use of the short method in 
saving time in a simple series is doubtful. This simple illus- 
tration is included here to make clear the principle under- 
lying the use of the method in the case of the frequency dis- 
tribution. With grouped series it has practical value as a 
labor-saving device. Let the student note clearly, however, 
before turning to the more complicated illustration given 
below, that the short method merely estimates the mean, 
and then adds a correction (c) which is the arithmetic mean 
of the deviations from this estimated mean. oni and the 
formula for the mean becomes: — 
M = estimated mean + correction 
M = estimated mean + = number of units in the interval 
in which d is the deviation of any class-interval from the 
interval containing the estimated mean. Obviously the 
method will hold true regardless of the frequency of occur- 
rence of the measures. We pointed out in the previous 
sections that there is no theoretical difference between the 
simple and weighted mean. It will be noted that the multi- 
plication can now be done mentally. In Table 23 we 
apply the method to the data of Table 21. 
The value of the whole method lies in the fact that it is 
a time- and labor-saving device. We estimate the “‘as- 
sumed mean,” and compute mentally the correction that has 
to be made to the assumed mean. 
The example in Table 23 illustrates the use of the short 
method. The entire distribution of 365 cases is first grouped 
in 20 class-intervals, each interval having a range of five 
per cent. This step results in the frequencies 8, 2, 9, 8, 24, 
etc. These are then totaled, giving 365. Instead of next 
multiplying the mid-point of each interval (a three-place

number) by the corresponding frequency, we estimate 
the class-interval, 45.0 to 49.99, the mid-point of which 
most closely approximates the position of the true mean. 
This can be determined by inspecting the frequency dis- 
tribution, counting up from one end until half the cases 
are included. Practice in this “scanning”’ of the distribu- 
tion will give skill in closely approximating the true mean.
-P-A-G-E-148
  124 STATISTICAL METHODS 
The labor involved in mental multiplication will be further 
reduced by taking the assumed mean at the portion of the 
distribution at which the measures are most heavily con- 
centrated. 
Use of class-intervals with the short method. The next 
step consists of tabulating the number of units distant that 
the mid-point of each class-interval is from the mid-point of 
the interval containing the assumed mean, 47.5. These dis- 
tances are called deviations “d,” and in the example are: 
interval 50.0-54.99 is 1 unit above, or larger than, 45.0— 
49.99, therefore its deviation is +1; d for 55.0-59.99 is 
+ 2; for 40.0-44.99 is —1; for 35,0-39.99 is —2, ete. Thus, 
the whole short method merely treats the class-intervals as 
units of 1 instead of 5 or whatever they may be. 
With the traditional method of finding the weighted 
mean we would next multiply the mid-point of each class- 
interval by its frequency. Instead, we now multiply the 
“deviation” of each class-interval from the assumed mean 
by the frequency of the class, 8X10, 2X9, 9X8, ete., 
giving the column headed fd. Two points must now be kept 
in mind, — first, the fd’s occupy the same place in the 
computation by the short method that the fm’s do in the 
traditional method; second, that having assumed a mean, all 
of the deviations above the mean will be positive, and all below 
the mean will be negative. If we were dealing with the true 
mean of the distribution, the swm of the positive deviations 
should be equal to the sum of the negative deviations. Since 
only: in rare cases does the true mean fall at the mid-point, 
it will always be necessary to ADD to the estimated mean 
a “correction” (denoted “c”). Just as we find the sum of 
the fm’s in the long method, so do we find the ALGEBRAIC 
SUM of the fd’s. That is, we total the positive deviations 
and the negative deviations, and subtract the smaller from 
the larger. This difference is then the total amount that the
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 125 
mid-points of all the class-intervals deviate from the assumed 
mean. However, we wish the average amount of the devia- 
tions of the mid-points of the class-intervals from the as- 
sumed mean. This will be the correction “c’.” The average 
amount is found by taking the arithmetic mean of the sum 
cf the deviations, — in the example given this amounts to 
dividing the difference of the positive and negative devia- 
tions, 259, by the total number of cases, N = 365. This 
gives a correction c’ = +.71, which means that the assumed 
mean is smaller than the true mean by .71 of the range of the 
class-interval. Note that to find the true mean we do NOT 
add this value of the correction to the assumed mean, for 
this value has been computed on the basis of the class- 
interval of 1, instead of 5. Therefore the true correction is 
.71 X 5 = 3.55, which, if added to the assumed mean, 
47.5, will give the true mean, 51.05. The accuracy with 
which the mean worked by this method checks the mean 
worked by the longer method, depends merely upon the 
number of decimal places to which the arithmetic work is 
carried by the two methods. In Table 5 the problem dis- 
cussed above is worked by the long method to permit a com- 
parison of the two methods. 
Summary of steps in the computation of the arithmetic 
mean by the short method. In conclusion, let us summarize 
the method as follows: — 
1. Group the original measures in a frequency distribution. 
2. Total the frequencies. 
8. Estimate the interval that contains the mean. The value of the 
mid-point of this interval is the value of the estimated mean. 
4. Treating each class-interval as a unit, record the number of 
units that the mid-point of each class-interval deviates from 
the estimated mean, indicating as positive all intervals whose 
mid-value is greater and as negative all those whose mid-value 
is smaller than the estimated mean. These distances will 
nearly always be less than 10, because most distributions
-P-A-G-E-150
  126 STATISTICAL METHODS 
will contain less than 20 intervals, and the estimated mean will 
be taken approximately in the middle of the distribution. A 
safe rule is to take the estimated mean in the heavily concen- 
trated portion of the distribution. In this way the mental 
multiplication will involve smaller numbers. 
5. Multiply each deviation (d) by its corresponding frequency 
(f) taking account of signs. 
6. Find the algebraic sum of the positive and negative deviations. 
7. Divide this sum by (N) the number of measures. This gives 
the correction (c’), which is the arithmetic mean of the devia- 
tions from the estimated mean, in units of class-intervals. 
8. Multiply c’ by the number of units in an interval, giving c. 
9. Add c to the estimated mean to get the true mean. 
For most of the “averaging” problems of school re- 
search the three methods discussed in the foregoing pages 
suffice. A detailed analysis will be given later of the specific 
use of various methods of averaging. There are two prob- 
lems involving the computation of averages, when time 
rates or rates of increase are in question, that have to be 
treated by special averaging methods. We shall turn to 
these next. 
IV. Taz Harmonic Mran 
The averaging of time rates. At the present time the 
measuring movement in education consists largely in the 
establishment of “‘norms of attainment” in the various 
school subjects, and for various levels of scholastic develop- 
ment. We have many “grade norms” in handwriting, spell- 
ing, reading, and arithmetic in the elementary school, and 
for algebra in the secondary school. The “norm”’ is taken 
to be the “average” performance (expressed as so many 
words written in one minute, or read in one minute, etc.) 
of large groups of pupils found at the different years of 
school life who are actively taking work in the various 
studies. “Average’’ performance has quite universally been 
taken to be the arithmetic mean of the performances of the  
-P-A-G-E-151
  
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 127 
individual pupils. Generally this has been true irrespective 
of the conditions of work involved in the testing. In fact, 
it seems quite clear that there is no general recognition of the 
fact that there is an issue involved in the averaging of time 
rates. 
We shall therefore call attention to certain points in the 
use of statistical averages which may have been overlooked 
by workers in educational research. It is desired to establish 
the following points: — 
1. That there are two distinctly different methods of averaging 
time rates: 
(a) Averaging by the arithmetic mean of the rates; 
(b) Averaging by the harmonic mean of the rates; 
2. That with given material average performances computed by 
the two methods will not be comparable; 
8. That these two methods imply two different units of compu- 
tation, “the unit of work”’ and the “unit of time”; 
4. That a method of averaging must be selected appropriate 
to the unit of computation which is being used, — with the 
unit of work we must use the harmonic mean of the rates 
(the arithmetic mean of the absolute times); with the unit 
of time we must use the arithmetic means of rates. 
To get the problem clearly before us let us use the follow- 
ing simple illustration: — 
Suppose a group of five boys to have been tested for 
speed of solving the algebra problems used in the writer’s 
Test 1, Series A, by assigning a definite amount of time (2 
minutes) and noting the amount of work done. Let us ex- 
press the results in two ways : (1) express the efficiency as 
\ “the number of problems worked correctly in one minute”’; 
(2) express the efficiency as the “ number of seconds réquired 
to solve one problem”’ (assuming the problems to be uniform 
in difficulty, on which basis the test was designed). The 
1 This issue was first pointed out to the writer by Dr. L. P. Ayres. 
The writer later met the problem in his own work and is alone respon- 
sible for the present method of treatment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
128° STATISTICAL METHODS 
first method expresses performance as a rate, or in terms of 
a unit of time; the second method expresses performance 
in terms of a unit of work (the amount of time required 
to do a unit of work). Let us now find the “‘average”’ per- 
formance of the results of the testing, by computing the 
arithmetic mean (the method commonly used) of the in- 
dividual records in the two series. The computation is as 
follows: — 
Number of problems solved per minute Number of seconds required to solve one 
problem

average per minute one problem, or an 
8)60(7.5 sec. required to solve average rate of 6.897 
one problem problems per minute 
Formula of the harmonic mean. The question arises, why 
is not the time required to solve one problem as obtained 
by one arithmetic mean the same as the time required when 
obtained by the arithmetic mean in the other series? It is 
noted that the rate as determined by the two methods differs 
as much as fifteen per cent. The answer to the question is: 
The two series are not comparable until reduced to the same 
base. The base required is: What part of a minute is required 
to solve one problem? In the second series this is the base 
used (.e., the number of seconds required to solve one prob- 
lem). Each member of the first series needs to be reduced 
to that base. In other words, the reciprocal of each measure 
should be obtained instead of the rates themselves, and 
these should be averaged by the arithmetic mean. This 
amounts to finding the harmonic mean of the series of rates. 
We may define the harmonic mean as follows: it is the 
reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the in-

  129 THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 
dividual measures of the series. It may be expressed by the 
following formula: — 
ey et HN’ \m 
where N = number of cases, and m represents any individual 
measure. It should be stressed that the harmonic mean of 
the rates is the same thing as the arithmetic mean of the 
corresponding time. The work now checks up as follows: —

  per minute solved per minute to solve one problem

It has been recognized that the harmonic mean of a series 
of rates will always be less than the arithmetic mean. This 
simple problem shows that it will be less by as much as 
fifteen per cent with distributions of large variability. Natur- 
ally the two means approach each other in value as the 
variability decreases. 
It is clear that there are two distinctly different ways of 
approaching the problem of establishing standards of attain- 
ment in various mental or physical abilities. They are plainly 
to be distinguished on a basis of the unit involved, the unit of
-P-A-G-E-154
    130 STATISTICAL METHODS 
work, or the unit of time. To repeat them here, they are: 
(1) the unit of work: How much time is required to do a 
unit,of work? (2) the unit of time: How much work is done 
in a unit of time? It will be agreed that in order to get com- 
parable average measures we must use the same method of 
averaging individual records in the two series. 
Proper method of averaging with each of the different 
units. Granted that there are two distinctly different 
methods of averaging time rates (i.e., two different units 
of computation), and that results computed by the arith- 
metic mean on the basis of one unit are not comparable with 
those computed on the other unit, the question arises: Which 
method of averaging should be used; (1) with the unit of 
work; (2) with the unit of time? It must be recognized at 
the start that the taking of an average to represent or typify 
large numbers of measures is in a sense an arbitrary process. 
It is merely an attempt to select one numerical index (out 
of several possible ones) which shall represent adequately 
the status of the entire group. To state our problem clearly 
let us turn to the stock problem of the men rowing a boat 
at different rates. We may then adapt the conclusion of the 
matter to our own problem of educational measurement. 
First, the unit of work: Assume A and B each are to row 
one mile (or work one problem) and the time is to be taken. 
A rows the mile in 7.5 minutes, 7.e., he rows the mile at the 
rate of 8 miles an hour. B rows the mile in 5 minutes, 7.e., he 
rows 1 mile at the rate of 12 miles an hour. Together they 
row 2 miles in 12.5 minutes, or 1 mile in 6.25 minutes, or at 
the average rate of 9.6 miles an hour. On the other hand if 
we took the arithmetic mean of the two rates themselves, 
8, 12, we would conclude that the average rate of rowing was 
10 miles an hour. This would assume that the actual elapsed 
time for the two men over each mile was 12 minutes, or 6 
minutes for the average of the two. This is incorrect, for the
-P-A-G-E-155
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 181 
  actual elapsed time over each mile for the two men was 
12.5 minutes or 6.25 minutes for the average of the two. We 
may sum up the statement of the procedure in this way: 
with a unit of work used as a basis the average rate must 
be such that the two men will row 2 miles (or solve 2 prob- 
lems, if we wish to substitute the algebra test in place of 
the rowing problem) every 12.5 minutes. In terms of aver- 
ages this means that with any problem stated in terms of units 
of work, we must average “rates”’ by the harmonic mean. That 
is, in order to give consistent results the rate per minute, or 
per hour, etc., must be turned into “elapsed time required 
to do a unit of work” and the corresponding arithmetic mean 
computed. In other words we must satisfy the equation, — 
Tave, X tave.= T 
or, the average rate multiplied by the average time required 
to do a unit of work equals the total elapsed time. As illus- 
trated above in the problem, to average a series of measures 
by the harmonic mean: (1) take the reciprocal of each meas- 
ure; (2) find the arithmetic mean of their reciprocals; and 
(8) find the reciprocal of this arithmetic mean. This is the 
average rate as computed by the harmonic mean. 
Second, the unit of time: Assume A and B are each to row 
one hour (or work algebra problems one hour). A actually 
rows 8 miles in one hour, 7.e., he rows at the rate of 8 miles an 
hour. B actually rows 12 miles in one hour; 7.¢., he rows at 
the rate of 12 miles in one hour. Thus in one hour they both 
row 20 miles, and their average rate on this basis is the arith- 
metic mean of 8 and 12, or 10 miles. This rate we con- 
trast with 9.6 miles an hour, as computed by the harmonic 
means of the same rates 8 and 12. 
From the above illustrative problem we find that we can- 
not compute average rates by the arithmetic means of the 
individual rates, irrespective of the unit of computation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
132 STATISTICAL METHODS 
We find also clear illustration of the fact that, although the 
taking of an average measure is only a makeshift as a rep- 
resentative or type for the individual measures or a series, 
—in other words that the selection of an average is, in a 
sense, an arbitrary process, — yet each average has a par- 
ticular function and can be applied only in connection with 
particular units of computation. 
V. Tue Grometric Mran 
This latter point can be made still more evident by refer- 
ence to the specific use of the geometric mean. We may define 
this mean as the nth root of the product of the separate 
measures in the series, — that is, 
Me =V (aiters » . . . Gn). 
There has been practically no use made of the geometric 
mean in educational research, in spite of the fact that with 
problems of averaging rates of increase the average to use 
is the geometric mean. For example: — 
Suppose an individual’s performance, as shown by testing, 
had improved fifty per cent in ten practice periods, say in 
ten weeks. What is the average weekly rate of improve- 
ment? Is it five per cent, as shown by the quotient of the 
total improvement divided by the number of weeks? On the 
contrary it is found by taking the 10th root of 1.50 and sub- 
tracting the initial efficiency, i.e., 4/1. — 1, which gives 
us 4.1 per cent. In other words a weekly improvement of 
4.1 per cent will increase the efficiency by 50 per cent in 
ten weeks. It is clear that we cannot take the arithmetic 
mean of such geometrical increase as the above. To do so 
in this case would give a total improvement of 63 per cent, 
instead of 50 per cent. 
The geometric mean, practically adapted only to the
-P-A-G-E-157
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 133 
solution of short series, can easily be computed by the aid 
of logarithms. Thus the logarithm of the geometric mean 
of a series of measures is the arithmetic mean of the loga- 
rithms. The expression would read thus: — 
l log Mg pe eee, 
Steps in the computation of the geometric mean. The 
steps in the computation of a geometric mean are therefore 
as follows: — 
1. Find the logarithm of each of the measures. 
2. Find the arithmetic mean of the series of logarithms. 
8. Find the number corresponding to the arithmetic mean of 
the logarithms; — this is the geometric mean of the original 
series of measures. 
Another illustration of the use of the geometric mean is 
given below: — 
1. Suppose a group of boys to have gained skill in practicing 
shooting, 90 per cent in 3 months. What has been the average 
90 
gain each month? Not ee 30 per cent but 
4/ 1.90 —1.0=1.24 — 1 = 24 per cent. 
That is, at the end of the first month their gain in efficiency is 
24 per cent +100 per cent = 124 per cent of their initial efficiency, 
which was 100 per cent. At the end of the second month they have 
gained 24 per cent of 124 per cent = 29.76 per cent, which added to 
124 per cent gives an efficiency of 153.76 per cent. The third month 
they gain 24 per cent of 153.76 per cent = 36.24 per cent, and their 
final efficiency is 190 per cent of their initial efficiency, a gain of 
90 per cent as stated above. 
Thus we have described and discussed the computation 
of five specific averages, which are available for use by. 
students of educational research: — 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
STATISTICAL METHODS 
. The mode (approximate or true), a “position” average. 
. The median, — a “counting” average. 
. The arithmetic mean, — an arithmetic average based on the 
value of each measure. 
. The harmonic mean, — an average for use in averaging time 
rates. 
. The geometric mean, — an average with particular uses in 
averaging rates of increase. 
Of these, by far the greater use is made of the median and 
arithmetic mean. It is necessary next to establish the proper 
function, limitations, and specific use of each of these meth- 
ods of averaging.

AVERAGING 
  As students of education have turned to the use of quanti- 
tative methods, many fallacies have been evident in their 
manipulation of statistical devices. These are found in con- 
nection with methods of averaging, of measuring dispersion, 
of measuring correlation, and of determining the reliability 
of measures. We shall discuss each of these pitfalls in the 
use of statistical methods as we take up each phase of the 
work. We must point out here, then, certain typical fallacies 
in averaging, and proceed to the thorough analysis of the 
proper use of averages. Fallacies of averaging have been of 
two kinds: (1) those in which the wrong average has been used 
(e.g., the arithmetic mean instead of the harmonic mean); 
(2) those in which an incorrect use has been made of an 
average, — that particular average being the proper one to 
use in the given problem (e.g., the use of the simple instead 
of the weighted mean). 
A. Use of wrong average. In this type of mistake in aver- 
aging we find: — 
1. Averaging time rates by the arithmetic mean. We have
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 135 
already shown that rates of_achievement, obtained by the 
“unit of work” method of testing, may not properly be 
averaged by finding the arithmetic mean of the rates them- 
selves, but rather by finding the arithmetic mean of the 
corresponding “‘times”’ (i.e., by the harmonic means of the 
rates). 
2. Averaging rates of increase by the arithmetic mean. In 
the last section we pointed out the difficulty of defining the 
average of a series of percentage increases by taking their 
arithmetic mean. We found rather that the nth root of the 
product of the measures (i.¢., their geometric mean) might 
better be taken to represent the average status of the 
measures. 
B. Incorrect use of an average. Of this second general class 
of incorrect uses we find the use of the simple arithmetic 
mean for the weighted arithmetic mean. To this may be 
added the error of assuming that the measures of a distri- 
bution are distributed uniformly throughout the range of 
the distribution. The most evident of such mistakes found 
recently is: — 
1. Taking the arithmetic mean of the extremes of a distribu- 
tion as the “average” of the measures in the distribution. This 
is one of the most patent of fallacies in averaging. It is illus- 
trated clearly by the following data. A State commission 
appointed to survey the State’s higher educational institu- 
tions, collected data on the occupancy of classrooms in three 
state institutions by this method, — viz: “The maximum 
occupancy of any room (the maximum number of students 
regularly in the room at any period of the week) plus the 
minimum occupancy, divided by 2, equals the average occu- 
pancy.” Furthermore, to obtain the occupancy ratio for 
any building or group of buildings, they obtained the “ aver- 
age”’ for each room and took the simple arithmetic mean of 
these averages. This report gives no complete data upon
-P-A-G-E-160
  136 STATISTICAL METHODS 
which to compare the actual occupancy with these fictitious 
figures. They are obviously fictitious, however, and are 
based on two unsound assumptions: first that the distribu- 
tion of classroom occupancies is uniform, and second, that 
the frequency of occurrence of each size of classroom is 
constant. A recent report calling attention to this fallacy 
says: “Room 32 of a similar building in another state had 
a minimum occupancy of 1, and a maximum of 56.” The 
actual occupancy was then stated as follows: — 
  
  
  Class Size of class Ne ene gene fm 
A 56 3 168 B 23 2 46 Cc 19 3 57 D 6 6 36 E 5 4 20 F 4 2 8 
G 1 3 3 
Total 14 23 338 
  
Average occupancy = 23)338(14.7 
_ By the method of taking the arithmetic mean of the 
Ba = 28.5. In brief, such   § . 56 
extremes the occupancy is, 
an error in the use of averages is really caused by using the 
simple mean instead of the weighted mean, in that it assumes 
that the frequency of use of each classroom is the same. 
It also mistakenly assumes that the sizes of class are dis- 
tributed uniformly over the entire range. This obviously is 
not true in school practice. 
Which mean to use. The question as to which arithmetic 
mean to use (simple or weighted) in averaging educational 
data is one of great importance at the present time. The
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 187 
answer can be given the student only in terms of the relation 
between the nature of the data at hand and the purpose of 
interpretation. Use that method of averaging which will give) 
the truest picture of the central tendencies evident in your’ 
data. In the foregoing example the actual occupancy of 
classrooms is clearly typified better by the weighted mean 
than by the simple mean of the two extreme measures of 
the distribution. Educational conclusions based on such a 
method as the latter must necessarily hamper the progress 
of scientific education. Let us give some concrete illustra- 
tions of the use of the simple and weighted mean. 
The most frequent demand for “averages”’ is in connec- 
tion with the attempt to measure various aspects of school 
efficiency. Our figures are stated, for example, in terms of the 
achievement of pupils determined by testing; unit (aver- 
age) costs of various school activities; average age, experi- 
ence, training or salary of teachers; average amount of time 
devoted to this, that or the other subject of study, etc. 
Measurement of classes, schools, and systems of schools 
gives distributions of data that are to be expressed in terms 
of central tendency. Shall we express this by weighting every 
class, school, or system with the number of pupils in each, 
number of teachers, number of rooms, etc., or by taking the 
simple arithmetic mean of the records of classes, schools, 
buildings, or systems? This amounts to asking in the case 
of the achievement of pupils, — what is the basic unit in our 
data — the pupil or the class? the ‘ability of the pupil re- 
gardless of training, or the specific type of training to which 
he has been subjected? 
Take the case of testing pupils’ efficiency in algebra, as the 
writer has done it in 50 school systems. The number of al- 
gebra pupils per school varied from 30 to 100; the average 
achievement varied among schools by very large amounts on 
any one test. Shall the score of the school of 100 pupils be  
-P-A-G-E-162
  138 STATISTICAL METHODS 
weighted 100, and the score of the school of 30 pupils, 30? Or, 
shall they each be regarded as of equal weight with all the 
others, and the simple mean be computed? The answer must 
be made in terms of the basic unit — the unit clearly is the 
class, not the pupil. We are testing the result of the pupil’s 
training in algebra, his skill in doing a specific thing he 
has been trained to do. We are testing the results of a score 
of types of training, and these are the basic units. Contrast 
this situation with the determination of average height of 
school boys, the average age of teachers, etc. Here the 
basic unit is very clearly the individual boy or teacher, not 
the class into which he or she may be grouped, and the re- 
cords of classes, schools, groups, etc., should be weighted by 
the number of individuals. 
Another commonly occurring problem nowadays is the 
school-cost problem. We meet a series of heating costs com- 
puted say, for 20 school systems, by buildings, in units of, 
“per cubic foot,” “per classroom,” or “per pupil in average 
daily attendance.” In such a problem we should first classify 
buildings in groups in terms of like heating conditions, — 
similar heating apparatus, like number of rooms, etc. If 
this is impossible then unit heating costs for city systems 
clearly should be computed with the basic unit taken to 
be the classroom, cubical contents, or number of pupils, 
and not the building. 
Homogeneity of data. Still another very important prob- 
lem of averaging is raised in connection with the question 
of “homogeneity of data.” It is fundamental to the sound 
treatment of numerical data that we include in any one 
statistical group only individuals who have been subject to the 
same conditioning factors. For example, the attempt to com- 
pute the “average”’ salary of all teachers in a school system 
cannot possibly result in a clear statement of “‘average” sal- 
ary which will definitely be comparable to that computed for
-P-A-G-E-163
  
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 139 
another system. The “average” in this case is computed 
from a distinctly non-homogeneous group of persons, — 
elementary teachers, secondary teachers, elementary princi- 
pals, secondary principals, supervisors of grades and special 
subjects, assistant superintendents, superintendent, and 
other special administrative officers. To secure comparable 
measures we clearly must average separately for each statis- 
tical group, making sure that each is made up of persons 
whose salary status is determined by the same set of causes. 
The student should guard constantly against the fallacy 
of computing averages from non-homogeneous data. He 
will meet series of data, continually, in which he has included 
items that are caused by conditions qualitatively different, 
and which should be eliminated from the group. 
For example, suppose that we have tested classes of pupils 
in arithmetic. Ina class of 20 there are three who do not 
attempt any problems of the test. Should we sum the scores 
of the class, and divide by 20 or by 17? The arithmetic 
mean will be distinctly different in the two cases, and our 
interpretation of comparisons correspondingly so. Such 
cases must be decided by reference to the question of “homo- 
geneity of data.” If the class is under our immediate con- 
trol it will be possible to tell if these three pupils in intel- 
lectual capacity, previous training and physical condition on 
the day of the test are qualitatively different from the other 17 
members of the class, who solved problems varying in num- 
ber from 3 to 18. Comparison of the scores in various tests 
in the same subject will also help us to decide. If they prove 
to be so, they should be eliminated from the group and the 
average computed from the records of the 17. 
Another illustration from the field of school costs will 
make the point clearer. A recent study on the relationship 
between the cost of instruction and the number of pupils 
taught by one teacher gives the data reproduced in Dia-  
-P-A-G-E-164
140 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  gram 47, Chapter IX. It will be noted that the table in- 
cludes all groups of data on the number of pupils taught 
by a teacher, from 25 to above 170, Careful examination 
of the table will show, however, that the investigator has 
two distinct groups of conditions included in his study. It 
is evident that for the range from 25 pupils to 80 pupils 
taught by one teacher there is a very high degree of rela- 
tionship, 7.¢., that as the number of pupils increases the cost 
decreases in a definite way. This relationship may be ex- 
pressed by a coefficient of correlation of —.84. From 80 
pupils throughout the rest of the table it is evident that, 
as the number of pupils increases there is no decrease or 
increase in cost, and the coefficient is practically 0. The 
investigator has thrown the two distinctly different groups 
together, and computed relationship for a non-homogen- 
eous group. His coefficient of —.47 and his averages and 
measures of variability are largely fictitious for that reason, 
and conclusions based on them are of questionable value. 
Averaging ‘‘samples.” Before leaving this introductory 
discussion of the uses of particular averages we should refer 
briefly to the effect of averaging inadequate “samples” 
of our total mass of data. In educational research we are 
constantly forced to form conclusions from a relatively small 
group of data. How large, for example, should a group be, 
or how many times should a test be given to permit gen- 
* eral conclusions to be drawn concerning similar individ- 
uals in the mass or similar testing work? In other words, 
how many cases must we have to give us an “average,” 
typical of a very large number of similar individuals? To 
illustrate the point: suppose that we wish to determine the 
spelling ability of 20,000 pupils in a city system, represent- 
ing the achievement in part by some measure of “average” 
attainment. It is not expedient to test all of them. How 
many pupils shall we test to get a “random sample”? A
-P-A-G-E-165
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 141 
  common sense way to define such a sample is this: A sample 
of.any total population is “‘random”’ when numerical coeffi- 
cients, for example averages, computed from any number of 
samples similarly selected and of similar size will be 
approximately constant. (The more technical phases of 
“sampling”’ in statistics will be discussed later.) 
Functions and limitations of particular averages. We have 
thus introduced the subject of the functions and limitations 
of averages by a concrete exposition of particular difficulties 
that the student will meet in pointing out central tendencies 
in his data. It should be recalled here that these difficulties 
are of two types: (1) those which may involve the taking of 
the distinctly wrong average; (2) those which involve the 
application of any average to non-homogeneous data, or to 
an inadequate sample, or to an improper determination of 
the basic unit. The second point has been discussed com- 
pletely enough to lead to a thorough presentation of the 
former point. Therefore, we turn next to the question of 
the properties of each of the five averages, their proper 
functions, their limitations, and the specific purpose for 
which each should be used. 
Enough has been said to make it clear that the process of 
averaging is one of selecting the best single quantity to 
characterize the central tendency of a distribution; that 
any average that is used must have certain properties which 
will show it to be a good representation of type. 
Summary of essential properties of a valid average.’ It 
will aid the discussion to list here the essential character- 
istics of representative averages: — 
1. If it is to be completely representative of the entire distribu- 
tion, it must be contributed to by all the measures of the dis- 
tribution.   
1 The writer has been aided in making a complete summary of these 
properties by Yule’s discussion, Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, 
chapter on averages. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  142 STATISTICAL METHODS 
2. It should be purely quantitative, — defined by the numerical 
data alone, and should not involve the judgment of the ob- 
server. | 
8. It should be so constructed as to be relatively simple in com- 
putation. 
4. It should be stable: that is, it should be of such a nature that 
representative samples taken from the total population will 
give a fairly constant average value. All other factors being 
equal, that average which gives the smallest fluctuation in 
value as we take different samples from the total group, is the 
best average to use. 
5. An average must not be much displaced by slight changes 
in the arrangement of the frequency distribution. References 
to the discussion of the arrangement of data in the frequency 
distribution will make clear the importance of getting an aver- 
age that will be fairly stable, regardless of the size or position 
of class-interval that is selected. Furthermore, the average 
must beas little as possible affected by errors in observation. 
6. Since the purpose of averaging is to point out clearly central 
tendencies to the reader, the average which is selected should 
be of such simple and definite nature that the lay reader will 
grasp easily its typifying significance. In this characteristic 
the geometric and harmonic means show themselves to be poor 
averages, the arithmetic, median, and mode being much more 
easily understood. Complete success in using an average must 
depend on the student and the reader being able to think 
clearly in terms of the average. 
From the standpoint of mathematical treatment, in the refined 
use of averages, it is important that an average be susceptible 
of algebraic manipulation. For example, it has been repeatedly 
pointed out that it should be possible to express an average 
obtained from the combination of two or more samples of the 
same data in terms of the averages of each of the samples. ot 
| VII. Use or tue Dirrerent Measures or CENTRAL 
‘TENDENCY 
It will now be possible to come to some agreement con- 
cerning the proper use of averages by checking each against 
the foregoing list of essential properties.
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 143 
Function of the mode as a measure of type. Taking up 
our properties in order, these conclusions seem evident: a . The mode is not contributed to by all the measures. On the 
contrary it may be determined by a relatively small propor- 
tion of the total number of measures, concentrated in one class. 
. It is quantitative in the sense that it is defined by the fre- 
quency of the largest class. 
. The empirical mode is an inspection average, and thus is the 
easiest of all the averages to determine. Furthermore, it may 
be determined without any detailed knowledge of the extremes 
of the distribution except that the frequency of measures 
there is small. On the other hand, the theoretical mode is the 
most difficult to compute of any of the averages, depending on 
the most advanced theory of “curve-fitting.” 
. It is more unstable than the arithmetic mean or median in its 
fluctuations, due to the taking of different samples from a 
given group of data. 
. In any but closely symmetrical distributions it is relatively 
unstable in the way in which it depends very closely on the 
method of grouping of the class-intervals. The manner in 
which it fluctuates is illustrated by Diagrams 20 and 21, as we 
change the size and position of the class-interval. For fairly 
refined work it is evident that the mode is too unstable for ef- 
fective use, 
. The mode has the advantage of being the most easily com- 
prehended of any of the averages. It is the ‘newspaper aver- 
age’’; the average of the man on the street, and for the lay 
reader has a clearer meaning than most of the other averages. 
Here it finds its principal function in describing skewed distri- 
butions of many class-intervals, with distinct concentration of 
measures in certain class-intervals. Furthermore, it serves a 
good purpose in the graphic representation of measures, be- 
ing marked by distinct peaks in the frequency polygon. 
. It is clear that the empirical mode (the only one in which the 
student of education is interested) has no mathematical signifi- 
cance, and is not susceptible of algebraic treatment as is the 
arithmetic mean. 
In résumé, it should be clear that the empirical mode is 
only a rough inspection average; that it may be indicated 
 
-P-A-G-E-168

to the reader as one means of pointing out central tenden- 
cies; but that its capacity for representing the central ten- 
dency is very limited. De 
inspection of a distributio 
in very symmetrical dist: 
The geometric mean ri ndence on it beyond preliminary 
s not to be recommended, except 
ibutions. 
s a measure of central tendency. 
  With the exception of problems involving the averaging of 
rates of increase, the student of educational research will 
have comparatively little need for using the geometric mean. 
Its computation is rather laborious; it is not readily com- 
prehended by the lay abe (not having come into popular 
use); and its mathematical properties are abstract, although 
valuable in certain forms of problem work. 
The principal function of the geometric mean is found in 
treating data which involve rates of increase, and which 
thus take the form of metric series. For example, in 
problems in averaging increases in population, attendance 
in school, growth in the teaching staff, budget, etc., aver- 
age status can be more consistently defined by means of the 
geometric mean. 
A second valuable property of the geometric mean is 
found in connection with the discussion of index numbers 
or ratios. It may be said that the mathematical properties of 
the geometric mean establish the superiority of that mean 
over that of the arithmetic mean or the median, in aver- 
aging such index-numbers. 
Use of the harmonic mean in measuring central tendency. 
In connection with the discussion of the harmonic mean 
on pages 126-131, its ‘sre function as an average of 
progress rates was pointed out. This valuable property of 
the harmonic mean should be kept in mind, and brought 
into use in all problems of that nature. 
The median as a measure of central tendency. With refer- 
ence to the median, the following conclusions seem evident:  
-P-A-G-E-169
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 145 
1. The median is contributed to by all the measures of the se- 
ries, the magnitude of each, however, being taken account 
of only indirectly. That is, the median is an average de- 
pending on the serial order of values and on the actual nu- 
merical value only as it determines this serial arrangement. 
2. It is quantitative, being defined at least indirectly by the 
values of the measures. 
3. It has the great advantage that it is the most easily com- 
puted of all the numerical averages; it is a “counting aver- 
age,” depending for its determination on (a) the serial ar- 
rangement of the measures (with the use of the frequency 
distribution this is a necessary step of the computation of the 
arithmetic mean also); (b) the counting in of half the meas- 
ures to reach the median point on the scale. 
Fluctuations in the size of the median may be larger with the 
taking of small samples. At the same time the median may 
give a more stable average from small samples, due to fluc- 
tuation in the size of extreme values. In this particular it 
should be pointed out that the median is affected less by 
the extremes of the distribution — that is by unusually large 
or small measures — than is the arithmetic mean, which takes 
full account of these values. The student must decide care- 
fully, in connection with his specific distribution, whether 
the “average” should or should not be contributed to by unu- 
sually large or small values. If they are regarded as important 
the arithmetic mean is the best representative of central ten- 
dency; if not, then the median is the better measure of type. 
Again, the location of the median depends only partially on 
a small group of measures; in this, it differs distinctly from 
the mode. However if it happens that the measures in a 
distribution are largely concentrated in a few intervals, it 
may result that the median (falling at a point on the scale 
at which many measures are concentrated) will be very in- 
definite. 
5. With the types of distribution commonly met in educational 
problems, the median is but little subject to fluctuation with 
rearrangement in the size and position of class-intervals. 
Reference to Diagrams 20 and 21 shows the relatively stable 
position of the median in the distribution of fairly large num- 
bers, with a form not more than moderately skewed. 
6. The median must rank high in the ease with which its mean- = 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  STATISTICAL METHODS 
ing may be grasped by. the lay reader. Partly for this reason, 
it is being adopted rapidly by students of education. 
7. The median does not lend itself to algebraic treatment. 
(a) The median of component parts of a distribution cannot 
be expressed in terms of the median of whole distribution; this 
is true because the distribution depends on the form of the 
component distributions, and not on their medians alone. 
(b) No theorems can be expressed for the median values 
of measurements subject to error. 
Use of the arithmetic mean as a measure of central ten- 
dency. Applying the criteria of the essentials of a valid 
average to the arithmetic mean we find that it outranks 
all the others as a sound measure of central tendency. 
It conforms to all the stated properties for a desirable 
mean as listed above. It is definitely and numerically de- 
fined; is based on all the measures; is popularly known and 
commonly used, hence will always be readily grasped by 
the lay reader; is very easily calculated (in this it ranks high 
as a mean, ¢.g., the short method of computing the mean is 
also a necessary step in the determination of the standard 
deviation and of the correlation coefficient); the aggregate 
and the number of cases are sufficient to enable the compu- 
tation of the mean, 7.e., the specific individuals do not need 
to be treated; and in adaptation to algebraical treatment 
it has a great advantage over the other means. For exam- 
ple, important properties of this mean are: — 
1. The algebraic sum of the deviations from the arithmetic 
mean equals 0; 
2. The average of a series may readily be expressed in terms of 
the means of component parts of the series. From this it can 
be deduced that the approximate value of a mean in a fre- 
quency distribution is the same whether we assume that all 
the values in any class are identical with the mid-value of the 
class-interval, or that the mean of all the values in the class 
is identical with the mid-value of the class-interval; 
8. The mean of all the sums and differences of corresponding 
measures in the two series (of equal number of measures) is 
equal to the sum or difference of the means of the two series.
-P-A-G-E-171
THE METHOD OF AVERAGES 147 
  The arithmetic mean is also characterized by the fact 
that the sum of the squares of the deviations of measures 
from the mean is a minimum. The arithmetic mean has 
properties of fundamental importance in the field of math- 
ematical statistics, especially in connection with the theory 
of errors and the theory of probability (¢.g., the arithmetic 
mean can be shown to be the most probable value of a series 
of measures). Accidental errors of observation tend to neu- 
tralize each other around the arithmetic mean. The error of 
the average is considerably smaller than the error of a single 
measure, and the accuracy of the arithmetic mean varies 
directly with the square root of the number of the measures. 
The median and mode have no similar properties.

CHAPTER VI 
THE MEASUREMENT OF VARIABILITY 
Srconp MrErTHoD OF DESCRIBING A FREQUENCY 
DistRIBUTION 
Need for measures of variability. It has been pointed out 
in the last chapter that the average of a distribution cannot 
possibly completely represent the measures of the distribu- 
tion. At best, it is but a partial measure of type, arbi- 
trarily selected to represent central tendency. We have 
indicated with what relative degree of success the different 
averages do this. Frequently the student of education will 
have to compare two distributions in which the average is 
closely the same, but in which the FORM of the distribu- 
tion is very different. This calls attention to the need of 
interpreting our data only after careful examination of both 
the entire distribution and the frequency polygon plotted 
from it. : 
For example, Diagram 22, Chapter V, is drawn to repre- 
sent the achievement of two classes. The average, as shown 
by the arithmetic mean or the median, is the same in both 
distributions. If one should compare the two distributions 
on the basis of the average achievement alone his interpre- 
tation concerning the outcomes of teaching in the two 
classes would most certainly be wrong. This is evident 
by a study of the characteristic differences in the two fre- 
quency distributions: (1) the “RANGE” in the one case 
is nearly as long as in the other; (2) on the other hand, the 
measures in one distribution are very much more concentrated 
near the middle of one group than of the other. One   Ht
-P-A-G-E-174
150 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  could say, for example, that the “middle half” was dis- 
tributed over a portion of the scale not much more than 
half as large in one case as in the other. This certainly 
means that the teaching has in one case served to develop a 
rather compact group, that is, teaching emphasis has been 
so distributed that differences in achievement have been 
largely smoothed out. In the other case the teaching has 
resulted in a widely scattered group, certainly calling for 
reclassification of pupils in connection with any further 
learning in that subject. 
In pointing out the characteristic differences between 
such distributions we make clear the kind of measure that 
is needed with which to supplement the use of an average. 
We need some measure which will indicate the degree to 
which the measures are concentrated around the average, or 
— to express it another way — a measure which will point 
out concretely the degree to which the measures vary away 
from the average. That is, we need measures of variability or 
dispersion. 
Variability a distance on a scale. We found that a measure 
of central tendency, such as an average, is always expressed 
as “position,” — as a point on the scale. We now find that 
with symmetrical distributions, a measure of variability is 
always expressed as that distance on the scale, which includes 
a particular proportion of the measures in the distribution. 
Although educational distributions are not perfectly sym- 
metrical, it will be a helpful device for pointing out the de- 
gree of concentration or lack of concentration of the meas- 
ures to say: “approximately such a proportion of measures is 
included between such unit distances on the scale.” We have 
already emphasized the importance of the term “unit” and 
“scale.” The student now will find that his measure of va- 
riability is nothing but a unit distance on the scale. Of the 
different unit distances that we have for measuring varia-  
-P-A-G-E-175
MEASUREMENT OF VARIABILITY 151 
  bility, each includes a certain proportion of the measures 
under the frequency curve. 
Four measures of absolute variability. For example, the 
four measures of absolute variability that we use, and the 
approximate proportion of the measures included within 
their limits, when laid off on the scale, are: — 
1. The range: includes all of the measures in the distribu- 
tion. 
2. The quartile-deviation or median-deviation: when laid off 
on each side of the average: includes only roughly half of 
the measures. 
8. The standard deviation: when laid off on each side of 
the average: includes approximately the middle two thirds 
of the distribution. 
4, The mean deviation: when laid off on each side of the 
average: includes approximately the middle half of the 
measures. 
Unit distances with normal and skewed distributions. .We 
should emphasize the fact here, that with distributions that 
are not perfectly symmetrical (¢.g., Diagram 27), we are able 
to state the proportion of measures included by these unit 
distances on the scale only very approximately. With a sym- 
metrical distribution, for example, the “probability curve’”’ 
shown in Diagram 28, we are able to state the proportion 
of measures exactly. Diagrams 27 and 28 illustrate this dis- 
tinction, and, although we shall take them up more thor- 
oughly in Chapter VIII, we may point out, the important 
features here. On these diagrams are indicated graphically 
and literally the chief characteristics of these measures of 
variability. 
It will be evident to the reader that with the perfectly 
symmetrical distribution, Diagram 28, any unit distance 
may be laid off from the average (in this case arithmetic 
mean, median, and mode coincide) either way and include

the same proportion of cases. Thus, it will be shown in 
Chapter VII that between the curve, the base line, and ordi- 
nates erected at a unit distance from the mean called the 
Probable Error (P.E.), 25 per cent of the measures is in- 
cluded, or 50 per cent between P.E. and the curve and 
the base line. In this case it is clear that on the “ Normal

equals the P.E. In the same way it will be shown that 
between the curve, the base line, and ordinates erected at 
a unit distance called sigma (c), the standard deviation,

the unsymmetrical distribution, Diagram 27, we see that 
we cannot define our variability rigidly in terms of the pro- 
portion of measures included between ordinates erected at +

154 4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
the same unit distance from the average. Nevertheless, it 
will be helpful to think of the variability, after it is com- 
puted, in terms of distance on the scale, — thus picturing to 
ourselves roughly the compactness of our distribution. 
Leaving to Chapters VII and VIII the detailed discussion 
of frequency curves and their properties, we will turn to a 
systematic presentation of the measures of variability. We 
should distinguish at the start two kinds of variability: 
(1) absolute variability, typified by any one of the four 
measures, — the range, the quartile deviation, the mean 
deviation, and the standard deviation; and (2) relative va- 
riability, described by so-called (a) coefficients of variability, 
or (b) measures of skewness. The distinction will be made 
clear in presenting the latter two devices. 
  I. Measures or ABSOLUTE VARIABILITY 
1. The Range 
An unstable measure of variability. We have defined the 
range as the difference, or the distance on the scale, between 
the largest and smallest measures. For example in the dis- 
tribution plotted in Diagram 20 (classification of 3 units) 
the range is 19 to 97. Inspection of the diagram will show 
that if we eliminate one measure at the low end of the scale, 
the range becomes 28 to 97; if we cut off two more measures 
it becomes shortened to 40 to 97. This calls attention to the 
fact that the range is a very unstable measure of variability, 
in that it may depend so completely on the value of a single 
measure, or of a very small group of measures. Thus, the 
range takes no account of the form of the distribution — 
zi.e., the degree of concentration of measures at various 
points on the scale. With fairly compact symmetrical or 
moderately unsymmetrical distributions the investigator 
should always state the range, in connection with other
-P-A-G-E-179
MEASUREMENT OF VARIABILITY 155 
  measures of type or variability, as a rough guide to the in- 
terpretation of his data. 
2. The quartile deviation, or semi-interquartile range 
The middle half of the measures. It has been suggested 
by many investigators in this field that a convenient meas- 
ure of the form of a distribution, i.e., of the degree of con- 
centration of the measures, would be to find how large a 
distance on the scale contains the middle half of the meas- 
ures. Yule has called half of this distance the semi-inter- 
quartile range, expressed by 
  that is, half the distance between the first and third quarter 
points on the scale. Qs and Q: are thus quarter points on the 
scale, defined as those points above and below which one 
fourth or three fourths of the measures fall. Thus, the 
median is Qe, the second quarter or quartile point. This calls 
to mind then, that the quartile points are computed for 
both ungrouped and grouped observations by exactly the 
same method as that with which we compute the median. 
Having computed the quartile points oné might take the 
distance (or difference) between them as a measure of the 
variability. Most of our distributions are not perfectly sym- 
metrical, and so it has become standard practice to use half 
this distance as the unit of absolute variability. In reality, 
it is not a deviation at all, being determined merely by 
counting in on the scale a given number of measures. Just 
as the median is a counting measure of central tendency, i.e., 
an average, so is the quartile deviation another counting 
measure of central tendency, 7.¢., a measure of variability. 
In computing it, however, no average is found and no partic- 
ular deviation from any central point on the scale is com-

P.E. and quartile deviation. Writers in education have 
often incorrectly called this measure of variability the 
' Probable Error. The latter term should be reserved spe- 
cifically for the treatment of that symmetrical distribution 
known as the probability curve. Reference to Diagram 27 
shows that the probable error (P.E.) and the quartile devia- 
tion are the same in the probability curve. Each one is 
equal to such a distance on the scale that when laid off on 
each side of the average, it will include one half of the meas- 
ures. The student should make himself thoroughly familiar 
with this unit of scale distance, the properties and use of 
which will be taken up in the next chapter. Most distribu- 
tions of educational data are moderately skewed, and so it 
will be wise to use the term quartile deviation (Q) very gen- 
erally. Yule’s term, the semi-interquartile range, although 
having a more specific connotation, appears to be too cum- 
bersome to obtain common usage. 
Computation of the quartile deviation: (a) data un- 
grouped. The computation of Q for a short simple series is 
very clear from inspection of the range. 
The steps may be listed as follows: — 
1. Divide the number of measures by 4. 
2. Count in on the distribution from either end to the point on 
the scale above or below which there are } or $ of the meas- 
ures. For example, in Series I, Table 24, — 
(a) Q: is the arithmetic mean of the values of the 6th and 
‘7th measures; Qi = 71.0; Qs is the arithmetic mean of 
the values of the 18th and 19th measures; Q3 = 87.5. 
(b) In Series II, } of the measures is 6.5, hence the quartile 
points may be regarded as the 7th and 20th measures, 
for these are the points which theoretically have above

MEASUREMENT OF VARIABILITY 159 
Properties of the quartile deviation. On account of the 
simple meaning of the quartile deviation, it is a good meas- 
ure of variability to use in presenting facts for the lay reader. 
It further has the advantage of being the most easily com- 
puted of any of the measures of variability. In brief, Q is 
the inspectional or approximate measure to use in expressing 
variability, in the treatment of any data in which numerical 
precision-is not necessary, or where the theory does not 
imply algebraic treatment. There are many opportunities 
to-day, in educational research, to use the quartile deviation 
as a measure of variability. 
  3. The Mean Deviation 
What the mean deviation is. We pointed out that, strictly 
speaking, the quartile deviation is not a measure of deviation 
from a particular average. Expressed in another way this 
means that the quartile deviation takes but indirect account 
of the form of the frequency distribution, — of the relation 
between the values of particwar measures and the frequency 
of their occurrence. There are two measures of variability 
that do this, however: the mean deviation, and the standard 
deviation. They differ only in the fact that in the former case 
simple deviations are averaged without regard to sign, and in 
the latter case the deviations are averaged after each has 
been squared, with the necessary subsequent step of extract- 
ing the square root. 
The mean deviation of a series of measures is the arith- 
metic mean of their deviations from a selected average (median 
or arithmetic mean) the deviations being summed without re- 
gard to sign. In the computation of an average deviation, 
the taking account of signs would result in a fictitious measure 
of deviation, the difference between positive and negative de- 
viations being always very small, and equal to 0 when the 
deviations are taken from the arithmetic mean. Therefore,
-P-A-G-E-184
  160 STATISTICAL METHODS 
to average simple deviations we are forced to disregard signs. 
From the practical standpoint, the deviations may be taken 
from either the arithmetic mean or from the median. The 
computation in columns (3) and (4), of Table 24, show that 
in the case of that simple series, fairly uniformly distributed 
as it is, the mean deviation computed from either average 
is the same to the second decimal place, 9.04. This will be 
true also with the data grouped in the symmetrical distri- 
bution, and with those not more than moderately unsym- 
metrical in form. From the theoretical standpoint, however, 
it 1s proper to take the deviations from the median, for that 
is the point on the scale about which the mean deviation is 
the least. Because it is much simpler of computation, and 
because of this mathematical relation, the recommendation 
is made that the student adopt the practice of computing 
deviations from the median. 
Computation of the mean deviation: (a) data ungrouped. 
Let us list the steps in the computation when the data are 
ungrouped. Each step is illustrated by the data of Series IT, 
Table 24: — 
1. Compute the median: 80.5. 
2. Compute the deviation of each measure from this value, 
15.5, 14.5, 13.5, ete., in column 3. 
8. Sum these deviations: 235.0. 
4, Find the arithmetic mean of the deviations by dividing the 
sum, 235, by the number of measures, 26, giving the mean 
deviation, 9.04. Column 4 gives corresponding deviations 
from the arithmetic mean, 79.97, a total of 235.06, and the 
same value for the mean deviation, = 9.04. 
Computation of the mean deviation: (b) data grouped in 
the frequency distribution. The computation still may fol- 
low the steps given above, which may be called “the long 
method.” The work given in Table 26 illustrates this 
method.

To make use of this long method necessitates a large 
amount of computation. The arithmetic labor may be cut 
down very materially by using the principle employed in the 
short method of computing the arithmetic mean. To dothis 
here would involve these fundamental steps: — 
1. Compute the total deviations about an assumed median. 
This can easily be done by taking the assumed median at the 
mid-point of the class-interval which contains the truemedian. 
2. Correct these total deviations about this assumed me- 
dian by an amount equal to the difference between the devia- 
tions about the assumed median and the total deviations 
about the true median.   
 
-P-A-G-E-186
162 STATISTICAL METHODS 
It will be shown below that the sum of the deviations 
about any assumed median must always be less than the sum 
of the deviations about the true median. Hence, whatever 
be the relative position of the assumed and true medians, the 
correction of the deviations around the assumed median to 
the true median must always be added. ‘ 
Let us contrast in Table 27, the computation by the short 
method with the correction applied in this way, and with 
the reduction to class-intervals of one unit each, but first, 
with the deviations stated in their true value, 0.62, 1.62, 
2.62, etc., instead of 1, 2, 3, ete. We can then go, second, a 
step farther and compute the deviations in terms of units of 
1, 2, 3, ete., and correct once for all by the short-method 
stated below, as in Table 28.

of the necessity for doing his thinking in terms of the scale 
of the frequency distribution. The diagram makes it clear 
that the deviation of each measure in any class-interval, 
when taken from the assumed median (a mid-point of a 
class-interval), is in error by that part of a class-interval 
that separates the true and assumed medians. For example,

culated shorter than they really are, each by .38 of a class- 
interval. In other words, there are 141 measures both above 
and below the 7.Ma. whose deviations are equally long or 
short, the effect of those above neutralizing that of those 
below. In addition there are 7 more measures that are short 
by .38 of a class-interval (7 X .38 = 2.66), making the total 
correction to be added to the deviations from the assumed 
median (A.Ma.) 524.66, as with the long method in Table 26. 
Furthermore, there will always be more cases short than 
long, because the assumed median (A.Ma.) determines the 
number of cases above or below the 7'.Ma., and the devia- 
tions taken on the side of A.Ma. are always short. Thus the 
correction will always be added. Table 29 illustrates this 
point for the case in which the T.Ma. falls below the A.Ma.

Steps in the computation of the mean deviation by the 
short method. In conclusion, we may sum up the steps in 
the use of the short method as follows, illustrating each 
step by the data of Table 28. 
1. Tabulate the frequencies by class-intervals (as was done 
by the computation of the arithmetic mean) and total them, 
t.e., N = 289. 
2. By methods described in Chapter V compute the true median 
(84.38). 
8. Select as the assumed value of the median the mid-value of 
the class-interval that contains the true median (80.0-84.99) ; 
therefore the assumed median = 82.5.
-P-A-G-E-191
MEASUREMENT OF VARIABILITY 167 
  4. Find “c,” the correction, or difference between the mid- 
value of the class-interval and the true median in units of 
84.38 — 82.5 . TE Me 38. 
5. In the illustrative problem this means that the sum of the 
deviations of the class-intervals about the assumed median will 
be in error from the sum of the deviations about the true 
median by an amount equal to the difference between the 
number of measures above and below the true median, multi- 
plied by the difference between the true and assumed medians 
(i.e. by the correction “‘c”). Therefore, next compute the 
difference in the number of measures above and below the 
true median; 7, in this case. 
6. Since each of these measures is in error by .38, the total devia- 
tions times their corresponding frequencies, when computed 
from the assumed median are in error by 7 X .38 or 2.66. 
Therefore next compute the amount of this total correction. 
'. Tabulate the deviations (d) of the mid-value of each class- 
interval from that of the assumed median (precisely as was 
done in the computation of the arithmetic mean). 
8. Multiply each frequency by its respective deviation, giving 
the column of fd’s. 
9. Find the sum of the deviations (fd’s), without regard to sign. 
Remember that this sum is taken about the assumed median. 
10. Add the total correction, from 6 above (in the problem this 
is 2.66) to the total number of deviations from the median, 
522 + 2.66 = 524.66, which gives the total number of devia- 
tions about the true median. 
11. Divide this sum by the total number of cases Cae = 1816) class-intervals. This is

  deviation, sigma, (7) that is coming into common use in 
educational measurement. It was stated there that if (on 
a symmetrical frequency distribution represented by the 
“probability curve’’), a distance equal to the standard de- 
viation is laid off on each side of the mean, and ordinates are 
erected from the base line to the curve, that between the 
curve, the ordinates, and the base line will be included 
68.26 per cent of the measures represented by the total 
area. The derivation of the relation between sigma and the 
curve, the fact that it is a function of the curve, and hence 
may be used as a unit in laying off distances on the base line 
of the curve, the method of computing the percentage of 
cases under the curve, and between ordinates erected at 
stated distances of multiples or fractions of sigma from the 
mean: — these, and other points will all be cleared up in 
Chapter VII. It is our business here, however, to familiarize 
ourselves thoroughly with sigma as a measure of variability 
of a frequency distribution. 
It was stated in the foregoing discussion that the compu- 
tation of the mean deviation involves the arbitrary pro- 
cedure of disregarding the signs of the deviations. The 
standard deviation, introduced by Karl Pearson in 1896, 
avoids this step by involving the squaring of all deviations 
from the mean. It differs from the mean deviation only in 
that feature. We may, therefore, define the standard devia- 
tion of a distribution, sigma (c) as, the square root of the 
arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations from the aver- 
age of the distribution. 
For the simple series: —

For approximate work with educational data it is prac- 
ticable to take the deviations from either the arithmetic 
mean or the median. The natural average to use, however, 
is the arithmetic mean, for it is about this point in the dis- 
tribution that the sum of the squares of the deviations is 
a minimum. (The mathematical theory underlying the de- 
rivation of refined statistical measures makes use of the 
principle that the sum of the squares of deviations should 
be a minimum.) 
Computation of the standard deviation: (a) data un- 
grouped. Thesteps in the computation of the standard devi- 
ation, when the measures are ungrouped, are simply stated 
as given below. Each step is illustrated by data from 
Table 24, columns 4 and 5.   
1. Compute the arithmetic mean of the series, 79.97. 
2. Compute the deviation of each measure from the mean; 
16.03; 15.03, ete. 
8. Square each deviation; (use tables for squaring). 
4. Find the total of such deviations, 256.9; 225.9, etc., = 2871.8. 
5. Find the arithmetic mean of the deviations; = 110.45, this 
iso. 
6. Find the square root of the mean; 10.51. 
(b) frequency distribution.

Just as with the computation of the arithmetic mean, the 
labor of computing the standard deviation by this long 
method is considerable. It may be very materially cut down 
by recourse to the short method, explained in connection with 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  STATISTICAL METHODS 
the arithmetic mean and the mean deviation. That method 
makes use of the principle that instead of computing the de- 
viation in each case from the true mean or median, thus 
giving three- or four-place numbers in the later multipli- 
cation, as in Table 24, an assumed mean is taken (any- 
where in the distribution), and the deviations are computed 
from this point. Furthermore, in the case of the frequency 
distribution, the assumed mean is taken at the mid-point 
of a class-interval, and the deviations are all laid off in units 
of class-intervals, thus reducing the arithmetic work to a 
minimum. To get the method before us clearly, we next list 
the steps in the computation that are necessary when the 
data are arranged in the frequency distribution. The data of 
Table 30 may be taken to illustrate each step in the pro- 
cedure. ( ; 
Steps in the procedure of computing the standard devia- 
tion by the short method. We may now summarize the steps 
in computing the standard deviation by the short method, 
as follows: — 
  1. Tabulate the frequency distribution. 
2. Estimate the interval which contains the mean; select it near 
the point of heaviest concentration of the measures; ¢.y., 
41.0-44.99. 
8. Tabulate the deviation in unit intervals, of the mid-value 
of each class-interval from that of the estimated mean. 1, 2, 
8, etc.; —1, —2, —3, ete. 
4, Multiply each frequency by its respective deviation; f x d, 
10, 9, 16, 14, ete. 
5. Find the algebraic sum of such fd’s ; =fd = 327 — 336 = —9. 
6. Divide =fd by the number of cases. (This quotient is the 
correction “‘¢” which (multiplied by the number of units in 
a class-interval) added (algebraically) to the estimated mean 
gives the true mean. This true mean does not necessarily 
have to be computed to get the standard deviation.) ¢ = —.03. 
7. Multiply each fd by d, its corresponding deviation, giving 
the column headed fd?; 100, 81, 128, etc.

the “standard deviation” (technically called the root-mean- 
square deviation) from any assumed mean. The mean of the 
deviations about this assumed mean is obviously in error 
by an amount equal to the arithmetic mean of the difference 
of the positive and negative deviations. (If taken about  
-P-A-G-E-196

the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations is in 
error by an amount equal to the square of this difference or c”. 
10. Square the correction, giving c?, .001. 
11. Subtract! c? from S*, giving o?. This standard deviation is 
expressed in units of class-intervals; 8.34 — .001 = 8.339. 
12. Find the square root of o? to give o, — still in units of class- 
intervals; 2.88. 
13. Turn o (as expressed in units of class-intervals) into a o 
expressed in unit measures, by multiplying o by the number 
of units in a class-interval. 2.88 X 5 = 14.4. 
As a rough check on the numerical work, it is well for the 
student to remember that for fairly long symmetrical or 
moderately-skewed distributions a distance of 6 X o includes 
99 per cent of the measures. Reference to this will often 
. prevent gross errors. There is a specific use of this “‘inspec- 
tional”? method in the determination of the value of the 
Pearson coefficient of correlation. This coefficient may be 
roughly estimated by inspection of the contingency table 
by noting the spread of the distribution. The extent of this 
spread may be estimated numerically by the use of the 
empirical rule above. This will facilitate the approximate 
determination of the correlation coefficient. 
1 The square of the correction is always subtracted from S? (the “standard deviation” 
about the assumed mean). The proof of this algebraically is adapted from Yule, G. U., 
Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, page 134, as follows: — 
Let z be any variable. i Let M be the true mean value of x. 
Let A be any assumed value of the mean value of 2. 
Let Z= 2—A. This is the deviation of the mean value of z from A. 
Now define any general root-mean-square deviation, S (e.g. o), from the origin A, by

a, is then the root-mean-square deviation from the true mean.” Now to find the relation be- 
tween o and the root-mean-square deviation from any other origin, —

Advantageous properties of the standard deviation. Using 
the list of desirable properties of the various means as given 
above as a criterion for establishing the value of «, we may 
say that it ranks high as a measure of variability because: 
1. It is numerically defined. 
2. It is based on all the measures. 
8. It is easily calculated. 
4. It is susceptible of algebraic treatment (e.g., it can be shown 
that the square of the o of a distribution is equal to the arith- 
metic mean of the squares of the «’s of component parts of 
distribution.) 
5. It can be shown by the theory of errors and sampling, that it 
is the measure of variability least affected by fluctuations of 
sampling. 
6. Its computation aids the determination of the Pearson coef- 
ficient of correlation. 
7. It is convenient because of the necessity of obtaining a 
measure which will vary with the variability of distribution, 
and squaring deviations is the simplest method of eliminating 
signs. 
8. It bears a convenient relationship to the normal or probabil- 
ity curve, in that it is the distance from the mean to the 
point of inflection of the curve, i.e., to the point of change of 
curvature. This will be made clear in the discussion of the 
graphic representation of measures. 
The general rule may be laid down that the arithmetic 
mean should ordinarily be used as a type, or average, and 
the standard deviation (deviations all measured from the 
arithmetic mean) should be used as a measure of variability 
in all fairly long and symmetrical distributions met in 
educational research. 
II. Measures or Revative VARIABILITY 
Types of such measures. In the foregoing pages we have 
pointed out the principal methods of representing the
-P-A-G-E-198
174 STATISTICAL METHODS 
absolute degree of variability of a given frequency distribu- 
tion. Measures of variability are principally of value, how- 
ever, in comparing one distribution with another. It is 
clear that standard deviations, mean deviations, or probable 
errors, 7n order to be comparable, must be measured about 
averages of approximately the same absolute value. 
We must recognize two distinctly different kinds of varia- 
bility in our measurements: (1) that in which two distribu- 
tions are compared that have the same unit of measure- 
ment, —e.g., salaries of teachers in two cities, achievement 
of two classes of pupils in a given standard test, or percent- 
ile distribution of municipal expenditures to various city de- 
partments; (2) that in which two distributions are to be 
compared in which the units of measurement are entirely 
different, — e.g., the achievement of a class of pupils in 
handwriting as measured by the Thorndike Scale (units of 
1 ranging from 4 to 18) with that of another class as meas- 
ured by the Ayres Scale (units of 10, ranging from 20 to 90); 
or the salaries of teachers compared with their years of 
experience. Both types of variability need to be discussed 
here. 
1. Unit of measurement the same. In order to secure 
comparable measures of variability it is not sufficient that 
the unit of measurement be the same. Examination of 
the data of Table 31 shows that it is not proper to compare 
the absolute variability of municipal expenditures for schools 
with that of expenditures, say, for the health department. 
If we used the absolute variability as shown by the respec- 
tive mean deviations we would conclude that cities are nine 
times as variable in their expenditures for public school pur- 
poses as for public health purposes. This does not at all agree 
with the conclusion to be made from the logic of the situ- 
ation, which is, that variability in expenditures for schools 
must be relatively small, and that for health relatively large. 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  
MEASUREMENT OF VARIABILITY 1%5 
Examination of these data shows us that the gross absolute 
variability is directly contributed to by the absolute value 
of the average from which we take our deviations, — in 
other words, by the magnitude of the units included in that 
portion of the scale covered by our distribution. Obviously, 
an absolute measure of variability must be many times larger 
when computed from an average of 32.30 than when com- 
puted from an average of 1.40. . 
2. Unit of measurement different. Similarly, it seems 
clear that we cannot compare the absolute variability of a 
group when measured with one unit, say salaries of teachers, 
in dollars, with that of the same or another group when 
measured in terms of an entirely different unit, say, their 
years of experience in teaching. In the former case, our 
range might extend from $250 to $1175, the average be 
$640, and the M.D. perhaps be $150. In the latter case, 
the respective measures might be, — range, 1 to 37, average 
9, M.D. 5. Thus it is clear that we need a measure of 
RELATIVE variability to cover these two cases. Evidently 
we must conclude that only when two distributions give 
about the same average, and cover about the same portion 
of the scale, are their measures of absolute variability 
directly comparable. 
The Pearson coefficient. To take account of the relative 
magnitude of the average and of the units on the scale the 
suggestion has been made by Pearson that we find the ratio 
of the measure of absolute variability (7, M.D., Q, or P.E.), 
to the average from which the deviations were taken (arith- 
metic mean or median). Expressed in algebraic form this is 
_ 100¢

called by Pearson the coefficient of variation. A measure of 
this type is evidently independent of the magnitude of the

units on the scales of the two distributions. In using it, one 
is merely finding the per cent (if he multiplies «x 100) that 
the absolute variability is of the average from which the 
deviations are computed. It is clear that the same type of 
measure could be obtained by dividing the quartile devia- 
tion or the mean deviation by the median. To do this in the 
case of the data in Table 31 gives the coefficients in column 
4. According to these, the item of expenditures for “ schools” 
is among the least variable, ranking with those for police, 
fire, general administration, etc.; and public recreation, 
charities and corrections, and health are among the most 
variable. These statistical conclusions clearly check those 
inferred from our logical analysis of the situation, and aid 
us by enabling us to speak in fairly definite terms. Expressed 
in another way, cities agree much more closely in their ex- 
penditures for the old established departments of schools,

Thorndike, however, proposes another empirical measure 
of relative variability, choosing to divide the measure of 
deviation by the square root of the average; thus: — 
100 M.D. Van 
A/ Median   
The results of using this measure instead of the direct per- 
centage of deviation and average, are, according to Thorn- 
dike, “more in accord with both theory and facts.” The data 
of column 3, Table 31, were originally computed by Elliott 
with the use of Thorndike’s coefficient, his interpretations 
and conclusions being determined by the relative size of 
the coefficients. He says, for example: “From these coeffi- 
cients it is justifiable to say that the expense for libraries 
and that for general administration seems to be least sub- 
ject to the influence of those conditions likely to produce 
variability, while the expense for charities and corrections, 
interest on the debt, and schools, possess, in the order 
named, the largest degree of variability.” It is plain that 
these conclusions are quite the reverse of those deduced 
above from the logic of the situation, and which are also 
obtained from the use of the Pearson coefficient. Further- 
more the taking of a coefficient containing a root or power of 
the mean used as base makes the coefficient very unstable 
when applied to problems in which that measure varies 
widely in magnitude. Contrast, for example, the effect of 
having a base (median) closely approximating 1 (such as 
health expenditure above) in which the square root of the 
base varies but little from the size of the base itself, with the 
case of schools, in which the base is 32, the square root of 
which becomes 5.657. To get the full effect of the liberties

that one takes with ratios of this type let us illustrate by a 
simple problem.

scale, 3.28. The writer’s experience leads to an acceptance 
of Pearson’s coefficient as a helpful device in roughly com- 
paring the spread of two distributions.   
III. Mrasures or Skewness or Lack or SYMMETRY 
In DistRIBUTIONS 
In the previous discussion of the treatment of frequency 
distributions, constant emphasis has been laid on the 
symmetry of the distribution in question. It was said re- 
peatedly that certain measures could be used (e.g., the 
probable error), if the measures were distributed approxi- 
mately symmetrically about the average of the group. 
Statisticians have thus faced the need of devising a single 
coefficient to express the degree to which the distribution is 
“skewed,” or the degree to which it lacks symmetry. It is clear 
that this coefficient must be independent of the magnitude 
of the scale units,.and we wish to represent it as a single
-P-A-G-E-203
  MEASUREMENT OF VARIABILITY 179 
number. Examination of Diagrams 20 and 21 will show the 
reader that a measure could be built up by expressing the 
relation between the mean, the median, and the mode in 
some fashion. In the perfectly symmetrical distribution, 
Diagram 28, they all coincide. With partially skewed dis- 
tributions the mean, mode, and median stand in a some- 
what constant relation to each other, such that the median 
lies at a point approximately one third of the distance from 
the mean toward the mode. Reference to the discussion of 
relative variability in the previous section will remind the 
reader that this relation between mean, mode, or median 
should be measured in terms of a unit of deviation. To 
satisfy these various criteria, Pearson has suggested the use 
of the following measure of skewness: — 
Mean — Mode 
oc Skewness = 
Since the true mode is very difficult to determine, we 
might use the approximate formula for it by recalling the 
relation between mean, median, and mode, getting: — 
3 (mean — median) 
o Skewness = 
Yule has suggested that an approximate measure of the 
same type might be built up by finding the difference be- 
tween the two middle quartiles, provided we measure this 
difference by its ratio to some standard measure of variability, 
measured in the same units, —for example, the quartile 
deviation Q. In those cases where Q is used as a measure 
of variability,

  CHAPTER VII 
THE FREQUENCY CURVE 
Turrp MEruop oF DESCRIBING A FREQUENCY 
DistRIBUTION 
Summary of preceding work. We have been continually 
trying to find the best methods of describing a frequency 
distribution. We have tried the use of the “range,” or the 
distance on the scale between the lowest and highest values. 
It was noted that this number depends solely on two values 
of measures which are subject to great fluctuation, namely, 
the largest measure and the smallest measure. We have 
tried to typify distributions by various “averages,” but it 
was shown again that either the arithmetic mean, median, 
or mode can but partially describe the distribution. In other 
words, two distributions may vary widely in the way in which 
the measures are concentrated or scattered along the scale, 
at the same time that they present exactly the same “‘aver- 
age.” So we have turned to the method of variability, and 
have discussed the use of measures to represent the amount 
of this “scattering” or “bunching” of measures. It was 
shown that a fairly adequate numerical representation of the 
two distributions in question ¢ould be obtained by giving 
both the average and the variability (e.g., by the arith- 
metic mean and the standard deviation, or the median and 
the mean deviation, or the median and the quartile devia- 
tion, etc.). These could be supplemented, in cases where 
the units of the scale of the two distributions were differ- 
ent, by a coefficient of relative variability. 
Our sole aim in treating educational data by any of these 
devices is to organize a complex mass of material in such a
-P-A-G-E-206
182 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  way as to facilitate clear educational interpretations. It seems 
quite clear that the mind finds it difficult to deal with whole 
frequency distributions, or with the original ungrouped 
measures themselves. The “average”? and measure of 
“variability ’ help to condense the material and aid in in- 
terpretation. It was pointed out in Chapter IV that thor- 
ough use can be made of such measures only by the most 
experienced manipulator of statistical methods; that the 
student needs other methods of representing facts. It was 
shown that probably the greatest aid to sound interpreta- 
tion of statistical data can come from the graphic presenta- 
tion of the facts in question. 
Smoothing frequency polygons to approximate ideal 
“‘ distributions.” It is suggested that at this point the 
student review the discussion of methods of plotting educa- 
tional data in the form of the frequency polygon and the 
column diagram (Chapter IV). It was emphasized there 
that, although we actually deal with but a small proportion 
of the total population of measures similar to those in ques- 
tion, our desire for educational interpretations of the data 
leads us to speak in terms of the frequency curve which is be- 
lieved to typify the law underlying our distribution. To be 
concrete: — 
Diagram 30 reveals clearly that it is drawn to represent 
a limited number of measures. If we had had an infinite 
number of measures, and the size of the class-intervals had 
been “very small,” the polygon of Diagram 30 would have 
become a “‘smooth” curve, perhaps somewhat like those in 
Diagrams 30 and 31. The matter can be more clearly ex- 
plained from Diagram 31. 
Assume that we can refine our measuring scale so as to 
get class-intervals of, say, tenths or hundredths of a unit, 
instead of 5 units. Furthermore, assume that we increase 
the number of measures from 303 to some relatively large

number, say 3000, or 30,000. The base of each rectangle be- 
comes “infinitely”? small, and the number of cases tends to 
be more continuously scattered. Thus we find that our “‘rec- 
tangular histogram” approaches “asa limit,” some smoothed 
curve, perhaps having specific mathematical properties and 
capable of leading to generalized interpretations which the 
very particularized histogram does not. We say, — the 
column diagram represents the actual situation with this 
particular “sample of 303 cases”’; the smoothed curve repre- 
sents what would be the most probable value of the measures 
at various points on the scale if we took the entire group of 
measures (from which we actually have but a small sample). 
It is very clear that a “law” could not be represented by 
the polygon or column diagram, but that the most probable 
definite curve must be sought to represent it adequately. 
The ‘‘smoothing” process. Since in educational re- 
search we cannot work with all the cases in the entire popu- 
lation, we may be interested in “smoothing” our polygons or 
column diagrams to approximate the ideal situation as far 
as possible. This can be done roughly by working on the 
assumption that the most probable value of a series of 
measures is the arithmetic mean of the series of values. 
This hypothesis can be applied to our problem of 
“smoothing” by taking the arithmetic mean of small groups 
of adjacent measures on the scale. Thus if we let A, B, C, 
D, E, F, etc., be the actual values of the midpoints of the 
intervals, we may average the number of cases found at each 
three adjacent points by the formula: —

etc., throughout the series. It is seen that the “true” value 
of each point on the scale (except the two extreme values) 
is taken equal to the arithmetic mean of its value and the 
two adjacent values. In the case of each of the extreme 
measures, it is weighted by 2 and averaged with the adja- 
cent measure. 
The result of such a scheme of approximation is seen in 
Diagram 31, applied to the distribution of Table 30. 
It is sometimes necessary to repeat the process of 
smoothing several times. This will be true especially in 
those distributions revealing sharp irregularities. It is clear 
that in most educational distributions these irregularities or 
“peaks” in the curve will be explained either by scarcity of 
number of cases, or by lack of refinement in the process of 
measurement. The numerical and graphic results of the first 
and second “smoothings” are shown in Diagram 31. It 
should be noted that smoothing by this method will not 
change the arithmetic mean of the whole distribution. On 
the other hand, it may affect the median or mode considera- 
bly. The results of the different smoothings reveal that 
beyond a particular repetition of the process but little is 
gained in the way of smoothed refinement.

School-marking distributions. Fundamentally necessary 
to the advancement of all phases of school practice is ade- 
quate knowledge about the intellectual and physical capaci- 
ties of school children. The design of a course of study, 
planning of teaching methods, adapting of all such phases 
of school machinery as grading and classification of children, 
their promotion from grade to grade, marking systems, — all 
these questions rest back upon the possibility of being able 
to picture completely the distribution of abilities in our

school population. For example, the design of a marking 
system, or of standardized tests for the measurement of 
ability in any subject of study, must rest upon clear-cut 
hypotheses as to the 
distribution of ability 
in the school popula-  ,,, 
tion in question.

of 5714 pupil marks  «.

are at once skeptical 
of the accuracy with 
which the teachers 
have judged the abilities of these pupils, all the more so 
when we note that the curves are concentrated at 75 and 
90 and when we find that these points on the scale repre- 
sent the passing and exemption marks respectively. 
On comparing our data with those in Diagram 24 we are 
convinced that the marking machinery does not represent 
accurately the abilities of pupils. Here, we note that, as the 
result of careful testing of intelligence, arithmetical ability, Compare this Diagram with Diagram 24.

  stature, and other anthropometrical measurements, the top 
fifth of our pupils is surely not more than 6 to 10 per cent 
of the total group. Certainly there is no reason to believe 
that even our high-school population is so badly “skewed” 
in ability that nearly one third falls closely together in the 
top fifth of the scale. 
Now, the administration in this particular system has rec- 
ognized recently that its marking is not fitted to the capaci- 
ties of pupils, and has faced the very real question: “‘ With 
what relative frequency should pupil-ability be distributed 
in the various fifths of the marking scale? What per cent 
of the total group-actually merit A, B, C, D, E?” To an- 
swer this question fully, this superintendent needs de- 
tailed objective evidence on the distribution of similar high- 
school pupils in large numbers. If he could secure it he 
would be perfectly justified in educating his teaching staff 
to the point where it would measure pupils’ abilities roughly 
in accordance with this objectively-obtained distribution. 
The distribution of human traits. Complete figures on the 
abilities of high-school pupils are lacking, but he has avail- 
able many measurements on human intelligence, various 
mental traits, and’a vast amount of evidence concerning the 
distribution of anthropometrical measurements on human 
beings. The student will be interested to note with what 
striking regularity they resemble a fairly symmetrical curve. 
Tn all such distributions, the measures are largely concen- 
trated very near the middle of the scale. Furthermore, they 
shade off in both directions from the middle high point, — 
the mode, — somewhat symmetrically. The student will 
note, furthermore, that in the case of those traits which are 
more subject to refined measurement, — e.g., heights of men, 
strength of grip, cephalic index, chest measurement and 
other physical measurements, and fairly refined psycholog- 
ical measurements, the curves the more closely approximate
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE FREQUENCY CURVE 189 
symmetry. In addition, we see that in those cases where 
very large numbers of measurements have been taken, as 
in Diagram 24, Fig. 4, heights of men, the curve strikingly 
approaches this symmetrical type. 
A century ago, the regularity of this accordance of the dis- 
tribution of human traits with definite symmetrical curves 
was noted by various observers. Quetelet, the Belgian 
scientist, made many such measurements, and early called 
attention to the recurring conformance of the shape of the 
curve of human measurements to the chance polygon got by 
plotting the coefficients of the separate terms in the binomial 
expansion. Especially close is the “fit” in the case of such 
physical measurements as stature and girth of chest. 
Laws of nature show continuous distributions. With the 
agreement upon the shape of the distribution curve of hu- 
man traits there came a recognition of the need for the 
definite establishment of ideal curves which could be used in 
the case of interpretation of fairly limited numbers of ob- 
servations or measurements. Science demanded a means of 
generalization — a method of expressing “the law.” More 
and more they commented on the fact that laws of nature, 
as generalizations based on human experience, were inter- 
preted only in terms of continuous distributions. The dis- 
tribution of human measurements was checked further by 
the distribution of “errors of observation” in refined meas- 
urement, — ¢.g., astronomy, surveying, etc. The plotting of 
such refined measurements gave a distribution resembling, in 
a rather striking way, the shape of the curve of distribution 
of human traits, concentrated near a mode about the middle 
of the range, sloping off quite symmetrically in both direc- 
tions, and showing relatively few cases at the extremes. If 
the errors be plotted with the error 0 at the middle and posi- 
tive and negative errors plotted on either side of this point, 
this may be interpreted partially by saying: first, that very
-P-A-G-E-214
  190 STATISTICAL METHODS 
small errors are most common (the error “zero” is really 
most common); second, that positive and negative errors are 
about equally frequent; and third, that very large errors do not 
occur. This may be illustrated by a brief quotation from 
Merriman’s Method of Least Squares (p. 18): — 
For instance, in the Report of the Chief of Ordnance for 1878, 
Appendix S’, Plate VI, is a record of one thousand shots fired 
deliberately (that is, with precision) from a battery-gun, at a 
target two hundred yards distant. The target was fifty-two feet 
long by eleven feet high, and. the point of aim was its central 
horizontal line. All of the shots struck the target; there being few, 
however, near the upper and lower edges, and nearly the same 
number above the central horizontal line as below it. On the 
record, horizontal lines are drawn, dividing the target into eleven 
equal divisions; and a count of the number of shots in each of these 
divisions gives the following results: — 
    
     
      
    
   
  In top division. 1 shot 
In second division . 4 shots 
In third division. . 10 shots 
In fourth division. 89 shots 
In fifth division. . . 190 shots 
In middle division. 212 shots 
In seventh division 204 shots 
In eighth division. 193 shots 
In ninth division. . 79 shots 
In tenth division 16 shots 
In bottom division. . 2 shots 
Wotabs 251. Sate . 1000 shots 
It will be observed that there is a slight preponderance of shots 
below the center, and there is reason to believe that this is due to 
a constant error of gravitation not entirely eliminated in the sight- 
ing of the gun. 
The distribution of the errors or residuals in the case of direct 
observations is similar to that of the deviations just discussed. 
For instance, in the United States Coast Survey Report for 1854 
(p. 91) are given a hundred measurements of angles of the primary 
triangulation in Massachusetts. The residual errors (art. 8) found 
by subtracting each measurement from the most probable values 
are distributed as follows: —
-P-A-G-E-215

    Between + 6.0 and + 5. 1 error 
Between + 5.0 and + 4. 2 errors

Between 0.0 and —1. .. 26 errors

Between — 2.0 and — 3. 8 errors 
Between — 3.0 and — 4.0.. 2 errors 
DORAL seeBics 0 clas oo Dietetl ei scare 100 errors 
Here also it is recognized that small errors are more frequent 
than large ones, that positive and negative errors are nearly 
equal in number, and that very large errors do not occur. In this 
case the largest residual error was 5.2; but, with a less precise 
method of observation, the limits of error would evidently be 
wider. 
The axioms derived from experience are, hence, the following: — 
1. Small errors are more frequent than large ones. 
2. Positive and negative errors are equally frequent. 
8. Very large errors do not occur. 
II. Toe Normat Propasiwity Curve 
Resemblance of actual distributions to ‘‘ chance ”’ dis- 
tributions. Enough has been said to point out the very 
practical need in all the sciences for a distribution curve, 
from which generalizations could be made. It was early 
recognized by these workers that their distributions resem- 
bled in a striking way the shape of the frequency polygons 
obtained by plotting the frequency of various “chances.” 
Since the manipulation of the mathematical properties of 
the distribution of “chance” leads to the ideal curve which 
we are seeking, we shall next turn to a very elementary dis- 
cussion of “chance” and the “probability” curve. Before 
doing so, let us state clearly the ultimate goal of the student 
of educational problems, in seeking an ideal curve against 
which he can check his actual distribution and from which
-P-A-G-E-216
192 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  he can generalize his experience. Expressed briefly, it is 
this: — 
1. Knowing that human traits distribute closely enough 
for practical purposes in accordance with a particular ideal 
distribution, we wish to be able to locate easily the propor- 
tion of our total group (assuming it to be reasonably large) 
that should fall between any two points on the scale of 
our measurements. Concretely, our superintendent named 
above, wishes to know about how large a group of his pupils 
should get A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and E’s. He also wants the 
process of this determination reduced to a minimum of 
arithmetic labor. In other words, our theory should lead to 
the preparation of tables by which the student can compare, 
easily and yet accurately, actual with ideal distributions. 
2. Another important goal of the student of education in 
dealing with “probability” is found in connection with his 
very real need for being able to establish the reliability of his 
data. He is measuring a relatively small “sample” of the 
total group, and has computed averages, measures of varia- 
bility, and perhaps of relationship. What dependence can be 
placed on the representativeness of the small sample? If 
he took other succeeding samples, would his measures of 
type and variability be practically what he has already 
found? Or can he feel assured that they would fluctuate 
much, and hence that from his data he can make no sound 
interpretation? It should be stressed here that adequate 
educational interpretations of the results of research must 
rest upon careful determination of the reliability of measures 
which have been computed. These two important needs of 
the student of education reveal the need for carefully ac- 
quainting ourselves with the way in which the “probabil- 
ity” distribution is found. 
We have pointed out that human traits are “combina- 
tions” and include many “arrangements” of a vast number
-P-A-G-E-217
  THE FREQUENCY CURVE 193 
of separate causes which may be assumed to be independent 
of each other. In deriving a theoretical curve of distribution 
for a set of many independent causes, we must recall the 
mathematical result obtained by combining and arranging 
such groups of causes. It is of interest to note that the 
results of such combinations accord so closely with certain 
mathematical schemes, namely, those of permutations and 
combinations, which, working under the laws of probability, 
may be studied and whose conclusions may be applied to the 
interpretation of our data. 
We shall next show the resemblance between the results of 
combining various arrangements of large numbers of inde- 
pendent causes and the straight mathematical theory of 
permutations and combinations. This leads to a statement 
of principles of GROUPING called combinations; and ar- 
rangements of same group or combination called permuta- 
tions. 
Use of permutations and combinations. From our ele- 
mentary algebra we will recall that, with a given number of 
things we can make only a definite number of groupings or 
“combinations,” ‘each combination of things being different 
from any other. For example, let a, b, c, d, represent four 
things. We may make four, and only four different combi- 
nations of these four things when we take them three at a 
time, namely: — 
abe, abd, acd, bed. 
If we take but two at a time we can make six, and only six 
different combinations, thus: — 
ab, ac, ad, be, bd, ed. 
If we take four at a time, but one combination is possible, 
abed. Now, with each of these combinations we may make 
two or more arrangements or permutations. The permutation 
is determined by the order in which the things stand. For
-P-A-G-E-218
    194 STATISTICAL METHODS 
example, with any such combination as abc, we may make 
6 permutations: — 
abe, ach, bac, bea, cab, cba. 
Each thing here is combined with each remaining pair of 
things. 
It is seen that the number of arrangements of n things (4) 
taken r (2) at a time is n(n — 1); i.e., (4.3, or 12): 
ab be ed da 
ac bd ca db 
ad ba seh de 
Take three at a time: — 
abe bed eda dab 
ach bde cad dba 
abd bda edb dbe 
adb bad cbd deb 
acd bea cba dca 
ade bac cab dac 
n(n — 1) (n — 2), or (24), and soon. The number of permu- 
tation of n things, taken r at a time is, therefore, — 
nr = n(n—1) (n—)........ (n-—7+1). 
Thus, since with any given combination of, say, 7 things, 
we can combine every thing with every remaining group of 
things, we can make factorial 7 permutations of things from 
the combinations. (Factorial 7 is written r/ or 7 and means 
DIS s Al: 4: Ts) 
Therefore, as we take one combination after another of r 
things, with each combination we can make r! permutations. 
Hence, the total number of permutations of n things taken r 
at a time is equal to the number of combinations of n things 
taken r at a time, multiplied by r/, or 
nr nor" =n? r; or, nor = ah r

We have said that “law” is but man’s generalization from 
his experience. We are interested in seeing now in what way 
he can check his experience against regularity of mathe- 
matical order. The above formula for the number of combi- 
nations of n things taken 7 at a time now enables us to fore- 
tell, in the case of a given number, n, of independent events 
working under ideal conditions, what is the probability of a 
stated number of them, 7, happening or failing to happen. 
To illustrate the operation of the principle let us take the 
case of coin tossing, assuming a coin to be a homogeneous 
disc and equally likely to fall heads or tails. Suppose we 
throw out four coins at random ona table. According to the 
law of combinations and permutations what should be the 
number of heads or tails turning up when 7 takes values of 
0, 1, 2, 3,4? There is now a total of 16 possible arrangements 
of heads and tails. Taking four at a time, say all heads or all 
tails, we can make but one possible combination, 7, 2, 23, N43 
taking three at a time, say three heads and one tail, or 
vice versa, we can make four combinations: e.g., — 
nop = aD ee arty), 43-2 
a rl T1238 — 
Taking two at a time, two heads and two tails, we can make, 
4-3, poe a d eae 6 combinations. Since each time we throw out 4 
coins, it is possible to make these combinations of heads 
and tails, we can infer that, should we continue to throw, we 
ought in the long run to stand a chance of getting various 
combinations of heads and tails in about the ratio of 
1, 4, 6, 4, and 1. Now if we plot a polygon, making the
-P-A-G-E-220
  196 STATISTICAL METHODS 
heights of the ordinates equal, to scale, to these figures, we 
note that we have a symmetrical polygon, with, it is true, 
but five ordinates. Let us take a larger number of cases, or 
coins, say 7. Now “the chance of getting all heads,” i.e., 
the number of combinations that it is possible to make of 7 
things, taking 7 at a time (n = 7, r = 7) is 1; the chance of 
getting 6 heads and one tail at a time is 7, the number 5 at 
a time, 21, the number 4 at a time, 35, etc. Thus we find 
that in the long run, our “chances” ought to be about 
1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1. Plotting these “chances” we find a 
polygon, with more ordinates, a flatter slope to its sides, but 
still symmetrical in shape. 
Probability. Our discussion has now turned to the 
“chance” of this or that happening or not happening. It is 
possible then to extend our discussion in the form of general 
statements of probability, and thus establish an expression 
for the probability of any number of events happening or 
failing. To do that we must make clear what we mean by 
probability and establish certain fundamental principles. In 
defining probability we must recall that we are but trying to 
idealize our actual experience in order that we may establish 
what would be the most probable condition, in case our 
actual data could be made infinitely extensive. 
To take a familiar actuarial illustration first: what is the 
probability that a particular child will not live to be 21 years 
of age? Weare forced to turn at once to the actual experi- 
ence of the human race under similar conditions. That is, 
we will find out what proportion of children actually have 
not lived to be 21, say 20 per cent or 1 out of every five. We 
idealize this experience by saying that since 1 in every 5 of 
a very large number of children fails to live to the age of 21, 
the probability that a child will fail to do so is 1 /5. Probabil- 
ity, then, is evidently to be defined as the ratio between the 
occurrence of a particular event and the very large group of
-P-A-G-E-221
THE FREQUENCY CURVE 197 
  events of which it is a part. Or, expressed in another way, 
it means a number less than 1 — taken to represent the 
ratio of the number of ways in which an event may happen 
to the total number of possible ways, — each of the ways be- 
ing supposed equally likely to occur.+ 
For example: if we toss a coin there are two possible ways 
in which it may come down, heads or tails. Hence the prob- 
ability of its coming down heads is 4, and of its coming 
down tails is 3. The sum of the probabilities is of course 
unity, the mathematical symbol for certainty. For example, 
if the probability of hitting a target is 1/5000, the probabil- 
ity of not hitting it is 4999/5000. 
Now, if an event may happen in different independent 
ways, the probability of its happening in either of these ways 
is the SUM of the separate probabilities. To illustrate: if we 
put into a bag 12 green, 18 red, and 19 black balls, and draw 
out a ball, the probability that it will be green is 12/49 (the 
total number of balls is 49, and there are 12 green ones); that 
it will be red, 18/49; and that it will be black 19/49. But the 
probability that it might be either black or green will be 
19, 12 31 . 49' 49° 49 
and the probability that it might be either black, green, or 
red, is 19/12) 18 
49° 49 49 46 49 
If we let P represent the probability of an event happen- 
ing, and Q that of its not happening, then 
P=1-Q or P+Q=1. 
Probability in educational research. Now, in our research 
we are dealing with “compound” events; i.e., those pro- 
duced by the concurrence of a very large number of causes,

assumed to be independent of each other. For example, “arith- 
metical ability” in a particular individual, may be said to 
be a complex resultant of a very large number of causes, 
e.g., those due to hereditary capacity, physical conditions 
of growth, and conditions of home and school training; ¢.g., 
absence from or regularity in school, outside activities, etc. 
We cannot isolate the specific unit causes, so hopelessly are 
they tangled up, but we can measure the effect of the combina- 
tion of this vast number of separate causes by the objective 
evidence; z.e., we measure the resultant human trait called, 
for convenience, “arithmetical ability.”” Now it is a safe 
assumption that these many separate causes are independ- 
ent of each other, — at least they are not related in any 
definite way. Human events thus are assumed to be “com- 
pounds,” analogous in their determination to compound 
“chance”’ events of an ideal nature. That they show dis- 
tributions of somewhat similar shape is very evident from 
our foregoing discussions. We need statements, therefore, 
for the generalization of such compound events. 
What is the probability of the happening of a particular 
compound event? 'The answer must be, — the product of the 
probabilities of the happening of the separate independent 
events. For example: if one of two bags contains 8 black 
balls and 9 red balls, and the other contains 3 black balls 
and 11 red balls, the probability of drawing 2 black balls 
in 1 draw from each bag = = * = . In the same way we 
may extend this to any number of events. P,P.P;P, is 
the probability that all of four events will happen, and 
(1 — P,) (1 —P.) (1 — P;) (1 — P,) is the probability that 
all will fail. Thus P; (1-—P,) (1—P,) (1—P, =the 
probability that 1 will happen and 3 will fail, etc.

of all events happening, all but one happening, all but 
two, etc., throughout the series. We thus have a general ex- 
pression to aid us in determining the probable frequency of

sccurrence of compound events contributed to by various 
assignable causes. To illustrate the method we ordinarily 
turn to such cases as coin tossing, or dice throwing, in which 
the chance of an event can be definitely assigned. 
Tf the chance of an event happening or failing is known, — 
as in coin tossing (i.e., if we let p = 4, q = 3), n may be 
assigned any desired value and the separate constituent 
probabilities figured. For example, if we toss 7 coins, say 
1280 times, and record the number of “heads” each time, 
we should get theoretically, from the binomial expan- 
sion: — 
12 68 (58° Ma om geen, On 
(+3) -iwtimtitintimtmte 1 
2° 2 128 128) «128 «128 «128 «128 «6128 = 128 
The degree to which an actual distribution checks the 
theoretical expansion is shown by the following distribution 
of heads and tails obtained by 10 students, each tossing 
7 coins 128 times.! 
7 Heads CH, 6H en Wes. vet aheiHs: (oH

It should be noted that in the tossing of the seven coins, 
nothing is more uncertain than that a particular coin will fall 
heads, but experience is found to check closely the theoretical 
statement that, in the long run, coins will fall heads and 
tails in proportion to the frequencies stated by the terms of 
the above expression. This checks the point made above, 
that while we expect great fluctuation in the sizes of par- 
ticular individuals selected from a total group of measures, 
if successive groups of considerable size are drawn out we 
expect constancy of average values. Recall here that we 
need these statements of probability because we are con- 
stantly dealing with selected samples of total groups of very

Probable frequency polygons. In Diagram 33, we give a 
graphic representation of the distribution of the probable 
frequency of occurrence of various events when it is possible 
to assign values to p and g. The student will perceive that 
making p and q equal, leads to a symmetrical distribution: 
with an odd number of terms, there will be one middle term 
with ordinates distributed symmetrically on both sides; with 
an even number, — two middle ordinates equal in size. 
Making p and q equal thus results in symmetrical polygons 
that seem to approximate the shape of distributions that 
have been found to fit various human traits. 
Each of the successive terms in these expansions repre- 
sents the chance of getting a given “combination” of causes 
in contributing to a particular event. To make clearer what 
we have here, let us plot frequency polygons, as in Dia-

extreme ordinate 1, represents a probability, aa that, say co)

gether in one throw of 8 coins (or in one sample including

these characters). That is, it is probable that, in the long 
run, once in 256 times all 8 coins would fall heads; the second 
8 
ordinate 8 indicates that it is probable that, in aes of 
the times, 7 will fall heads and 1 tail, etc., throughout the dis- 
tribution. It can be seen that, as we increase the number of 
independent contributing factors (m), our distribution con- 
tinually approaches a smooth curve as a limit. For example, 
the polygon plotted from the expansion (§ + 4)? is shown 
by Diagram 33 to approximate very closely such a “con- 
tinuous” curve. It can be seen that further increase of the 
number of cases refines very little, for practical purposes, 
the apparent continuity of the distribution. 
It should be noted at this point that the sum of the heights 
of all the ordinates in any one of our polygons represents the 
total number of measures. It also represents the sum of the 
separate probabilities, which we found must be certainty, or 
1, regardless of the value of n. 
The practical question’ now arises: How use the polygons 
plotted from various binomial expansions to help us in in- 
terpreting our actual frequency distribution? Is it possible 
to compute the terms of an expansion (and thus plot the 
polygon) comparable to the distribution of our actual data? 
We can answer at once: It is possible to do this, but to do so 
involves both a great deal of arithmetic labor (for example, 
the computation of many terms of a binomial series) and 
methods of approximation in computation. To check the 
interpretation of our data against an ideal frequency curve 
we certainly need shorter methods than would be involved 
in the use of “probability polygons.” We need, for exam- 
ple, to replace the polygon by a continuous curve which will

  have ordinates approximately the same relative height, and 
which will be so built that the area between any two ordi- 
nates, say y, and y., will give the relative frequency of the 
measures between the two corresponding values of x, say 
a, and x. 
The normal, or probability, curve. The continuous curve 
which does this is known variously as: the probability curve; 
the curve of error; the normal frequency curve; the Gaus- 
sian curve, or the La Place-Gaussian curve, after Gauss and 
La Place who separately developed the equation for it. We 
shall refer to the curve hereafter as the normal curve or the 
probability curve. The equation of the curve is developed 
by certain investigators in accordance with criteria obtained 
from the binomial polygon (}+3),” and may be stated at 
once as: —1! —2 
y = yoo 
In this equation e is the constant 2.71828, known as the 
base of the Napierian logarithm system. y and 2 are the two 
variables, x the distance taken on the base line of the curve 
from the mean to a given point, and y the height of the 
ordinate erected at that point. y, and o are two very signifi- 
cant terms in the equation of the curve. o is the standard 
deviation of the distribution, which the student has already 
met in computing variability. Thus if the deviation of each 
measure is taken from the arithmetic mean, and called d,

amount of variability of the measures around the mean. The 
student should stress the fact that the unit of variability, o, 
which he has learned to compute numerically, 7s exactly the 
same unit distance on the X axis, as now enters as a measure 
of variability of x in the equation of the curve. 
For an adequate comprehension of the graphical signifi- 
cance of o the student must study the way in which the equa- 
tion of the curve is built. Note that any distance on the X axis 
(i.e., any “x”’) is measured in units of ¢. Familiarity with 
this is absolutely necessary. 
Note furthermore that as you let z take various values, y 
is always expressed as a proportional part of y,. That is, 
when x=0, e°=1, andy=y,. Thus y, is the greatest or- 
dinate and all of the other ordinates of the curve will be 
expressed as fractional parts of y,. Furthermore the curve 
is symmetrical about the point 2 =o, and the arithmetic 
mean, median, and mode coincide at this point. The term y, 
may also be computed by the equation: 
i CEN:

where N = the total number of cases, ¢ is the standard de- 
viation and zis the constant 3.1416. Thus the complete 
equation of the curve, as written by followers of Pearson and 
measured in units adaptable to the data of educational re- 
search, is:

This, then, represents the normal probability curve, taken 
to typify, approximately enough for practical purposes, many 
human traits in which educationists are primarily interested.

CHAPTER VIIT 
USE OF THE NORMAL FREQUENCY CURVE IN 
EDUCATION 
  Havine established a type or ideal frequency distribu- 
tion, how may we make use of it? Four definite questions 
must now be answered: — 
1. How is the normal curve plotted in general? 
2. How may it be superimposed on any actual frequency 
polygon to permit of direct comparison of actual and theo- _ 
retical distributions? 
8. How may the normal curve be used to determine the 
number or proportion of the individuals that ought to fall 
between any two selected values; ¢.g., in the marking prob- 
lem above, how many pupils theoretically ought to get 
A, B, C, ete.? 
4. How may the curve be used to determine the probable 
reliability of the statistical results obtained from actual 
data? 
1. How to plot the normal curve 
To plot or graph a curve we need the equation of the 
curve. Having that given, eg., y=4¢+8, our prgblem 
consists of three steps: — 
1. Solving y for various assigned values of 2; ¢.g.: 
Let «= Then y =

  2. Laying off on the axes of X and Y, corresponding values 
of x and y and plotting the points determined by them. 
8. Connecting the points thus plotted, to give the graph 
of the line (e.g. in Diagram 34 the line * “represents ”’ the 
equation y = 4a + 8). 
To plot the equation of the normal curve 
in 
y= yoo 2 
evidently necessitates much more elaborate preliminary 
computation than is true of this simple illustrative problem. 
Furthermore, there are evidently two more terms, 7 and 
Yo, in the equation that 
  ¥ rs. | 1) 7. | need to have values 
22 assigned to them. Since 
i the equation implies 
a that all ordinates to the     
curve (erected at dis- 
tances from the mean

tional parts of ¢) are 
constantly proportional

-135y,, ete. The computation of values of y, then, for cor- 24

EDUCATIONAL USE OF FREQUENCY CURVE 209 
responding values of 2 can evidently be done once for all 
and the results compiled in a table. This has been done, and 
Table II gives the results. Note carefully that the computa- 
tion necessitated measuring x in units of , and y in units of Yo. 
Recall here that o, the standard deviation of the distribu- 
tion, is the fundamental unit of distance on the scale (the 
z-axis); also that the equation of the normal curve is so 
stated that y, is the ordinate of greatest height, and that it is 
aconstant. Therefore, the table has been derived by letting 
o and y, both equal 1, with consequent values of both z and y 
represented as fractional parts of o and y,. 
Steps in plotting the curve. To plot the curve then, our 
steps of procedure are clear: — 
1. Lay off distances on the z-axis equal to fractional parts 
of o, say .1¢, .20, .30, etc., out to, say 3.00. Note that the selec- 
tion of the magnitude of these unit distances is entirely arbi- 
trary, — hence that the exact shape of the curve will depend 
upon the units selected. 
2. Select a unit of scale for the y’s which will give a reason- 
ably steep curve, and erect at the middle point of the z-axis 
(i.e., © = 0) an ordinate equal to y, (i.e., equal to 1). Note 
again that the actwal length of y, (i.e., the unit of scale for the 
y’s), is entirely arbitrary. Your aim should be to take such a 
unit on y, that, in connection with the unit on 2, your final 
curve will be fairly steep. 
8. At each of the selected points on the z-axis, .1o, .2c, 
.30, etc., erect an ordinate equal in length to the fractional 
part of y, that is indicated in Table If. For example, for 
a= .1lo y = 995 yo 
xs 20 y = .980 y, 
a= 80 y = 956 y,, ete. 
4. Connect the tops of the ordinates thus erected, giving 
the normal frequency polygon desired. The student will
-P-A-G-E-234
210 STATISTICAL METHODS 
note that the more closely together the ordinates are taken 
(i.e., the smaller the fractional parts of ), the more closely 
will the probability polygon approach a smooth curve. 
2. How to compare an actual frequency polygon with the normal 
frequency curve 
We have just seen that to plot a normal curve we need 
but two items, values of y for corresponding values of x, and 
that these may be computed in fractional parts of y, and o. 
In order to superimpose a normal curve on an actual fre- 
quency distribution, so as to permit comparison of the two, 
it is necessary to find elements common to the two distribu- 
tions. Examination will show: (1) that o is common to 
both, that is, that the standard deviation can be computed 
and compared for ANY frequency distribution. Hence we 
can lay off distances on the z-axis, which have been com- 
puted in fractional parts of an actually computed o; (2) we 
can compute the height of y, for our actual distribution 
from the formula: — 
iN 
bo" Ver 
where N is the total number of measures in our distribution, 
m is 3.1416 and o is the standard deviation. In addition we 
find: (3) that the origin of the normal curve, 7.e., the point 
from which we begin to plot measurements, is at the mean 
of the distribution. This is another element common to both 
theoretical and actual distributions, for we can compute the 
arithmetic mean of the actual distribution. Having y, we 
can superimpose the two curves by putting the means to- 
gether, making 2 =0 at the arithmetic mean of the actual 
distribution. The distances on the a-scale may now be laid 
off by multiplying each successive fractional part of o, say, 
slo, 20, .3c, ete., by the computed value of « in the actual 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  EDUCATIONAL USE OF FREQUENCY CURVE 211 
distribution. Then, the length of the ordinates that are to 
be erected at these points may be obtained by multiplying 
the fractional part of y, (read from Table II), correspond- 
ing to the selected values of a by the computed value of y,. Co 
Summary of steps necessary for the comparison of an 
actual frequency distribution with a normal frequency 
curve. To bring all the above steps clearly in mind let us 
list them in definite order: — 
1. Plot the actual distribution, by methods already discussed 
in Chapter IV. 
2. Set the mean point of the normal curve at the arithmetic mean 
of the actual distribution. Call this point x = 0. 
8. Compute unit distances in terms of ¢, that will be laid off on 
the z-axis by multiplying fractional parts of o, say .1c, .2c, or 
-O1c, .02c, ete., by the computed value of ¢ in the actual dis- 
tribution. Note that these are to be computed either in 
terms of class-intervals or actual units on the scale. The two 
must be clearly distinguished. 
4, Lay off on the a-axis, to the scale used in plotting the actual 
distribution, these fractional parts of o. 
5. Compute yo from 
N 
ue oN tr 
6. At the arithmetic mean of the actual distribution erect an 
ordinate equal to this computed value of yo. 
7. Compute the height of the ordinates corresponding to   
w= .1c, 2c, ete., by multiplying each : from Table I, 0 
by the above computed value of yo. 
8. Erect the ordinates at the successive points on the x-axis. 
9. Connect the tops of the ordinates, giving the normal curve. 
3. How to determine the closeness of fit of an actual dis- 
tribution to the normal distribution 
Having superimposed a normal distribution on a dis- 
tribution of actual. measurements, how can we. determine
-P-A-G-E-236
212 STATISTICAL METHODS 
  the relative closeness of fit of the two distributions? The 
fundamental question involved in the discussion is this: 
Are the differences that have been found between the theo- 
retical frequency (y’) at any point e. and the actual fre- Co 
quency (y), indications of REAL differences between the 
type of theoretical distribution and the theoretical normal 
curve? Or are they so small as naturally to be expected in 
the taking of samples from a very large group. Note that 
the normal distribution presupposes a very large number of 
measures, while the actual distribution contains but a very 
limited portion of the total group. The question arises: Is 
the sample represented by our actual distribution a 
“random” sample — i.e., one taken by chance from the 
total group? If we continue to take samples of the same 
number of measures under similar conditions, will the sam- 
ples continue to give approximately the same distribution 
polygons, or will they be distinctly different? 
The questions indicate that the only way in which 
statistical methods can establish the normality of an actual 
distribution is by stating the probability that actual fre- 
quencies and theoretical frequencies at any point on the 
scale will differ by a given amount. They enable us to say, 
for example, that it is relatively likely that if we continue to 
take similar samples from our total group, that this particu- 
lar difference will occur or will not occur repeatedly. The 
complete explanation of such methods cannot be taken up 
in such an elementary presentation as this, but the following 
rule-of-thumb method may be given the student interested 
in these problems. 
Simple rule for calculation. Compute the theoretical 
frequency, f, at any point on the scale (this corresponds to y 
for that point); find the difference between this and the total 
frequency, N, of the whole group (N — f). Compute what is
-P-A-G-E-237
EDUCATIONAL USE OF FREQUENCY CURVE 212 
known as the standard error of sampling, or standard devia- 
tion of simple sampling from the expression ! 
ie jee N 
The rule generally given for the interpretation of the rela- 
tive sizes of the actual difference and the theoretical differ- 
ence, os, is that if the actual difference exceeds 3 os, then 
the actual difference did not occur as a mere fluctuation in 
sampling. (The reason for assigning 3c, as the limit will be 
explained in the next section.) Note that the most that can 
be said here is that it is probable or improbable that a particular 
difference occurred as a mere fluctuation due to taking a 
small sample of the total population; that if we continued to 
take samples of similar size that there is a certain degree of 
probability that a smaller or larger difference would have 
occurred, due to the chances set up in taking the samples. 
Statisticians who wish to allow as far as possible for diver- 
gences from normality as being caused by the chances set 
up in taking samples, imply that any difference less than 
approximately 30, might have been due merely to such 
fluctuations in sampling. Any difference greater than 3c; is 
believed to show the influence of constant causes which 
contribute to skewness. 
4. How may the normal curve be used to determine the propor- 
tion of a group of measures that theoretically ought to fall 
between any two selected points on the scale? 
Our discussion to this point has made use of ordinates to

of values at the selected point, and g= their probable infrequency. Thus, — 
r=5; g=n—F. os =i Uf, WH = Jaa 
We next wish to compare this difference, computed by os with the observed 
difference between the actual frequency and the observed frequency.

214 STATISTICAL METHODS 
the frequency curves or polygons, taking them to represent 
the actual number or proportion of measures distributed at 
different points on the scale. These ordinates erected at the 
mid-point of the class-interval are assumed to typify all the 
measures in the given class-interval. It should be clearly 
understood, as pointed out in Chapter IV, that the meas- 
ures in a class-interval are completely represented only by the 
area between the curve, the base line, and the ordinates 
erected at the limits of the interval. In the last chapter the 
point was made that we pass from the discontinuous fre- 
quency polygon represented by (p+q)” to the continuous 
—2 
curve represented by y,¢?% in order to deal with the ideal 
  case of large numbers of measures studied under refined 
conditions of measurement. 
Just as the sum of the length of the ordinates found be- 
tween selected points on the scale represents approximately 
the number of measures, so the area between the curve, the 
base line, and the ordinates represents accurately the number 
of measures. The actual computation of the various portions 
of the area under the normal curve, between various ordi- 
nates, would be too laborious a process for use in the working 
of every statistical problem. Provided the area is measured 
in units of o and in fractional parts of unity (because the 
area of a probability curve is 1), this can be done for a very 
large number of intervals on the x-axis and compiled in a 
table available for hand-book use once for all. This has 
been done by the refined methods of the integral calculus 
and given in the Appendix in Table III. The figures of 
the table merely state the fractional part of the total area 
that is found between ordinates erected at various distances 
from the mean. As with the construction of a probability 
curve by the methods described in Section 1, so here, the

  z-axis is measured in units of the standard deviation, o, and 
the area is given in each case for that portion of half the 
curve between the mean and the assigned value of Seen oC 
few illustrative examples will make clear the construction 
and use of the table. 
The table should be read thus: Between the mean (taken 
to be the origin of the measurements) and a distance, say, 
1 x ¢, will be included 3413/10,000th’s of the entire area of 
the curve, or 34.13 per cent. The curve being symmetrical, 
this is true for +o. Therefore, between the mean and +o 
will be included 68.26 per cent of the entire group of meas- 
ures. This is the foundation for saying in Chapter VI that 
the standard deviation is a unit on the scale such that if it 
were laid off each way from the mean, ordinates erected at 
these points would include about two thirds of the cases. 
Or, to take other examples: between the mean and .49c is 
included 18.79 per cent of the measures; between the mean 
and +2.5c is included 98.76 per cent of the cases. Between 
the mean and +3.0c, 99.73 per cent. It can be seen then that 
to go beyond 3.0¢ from the mean adds relatively little to the 
proportion of the area taken. Conversely, in practical work, 
it is sufficiently accurate to say that + 3c includes all of the 
cases, — only .27 per cent being neglected. In fact, this ex- 
plains our approximate rule, made in Chapter VI, that the 
range is about six times the standard deviation. The student 
will note that 2.50 neglects but 1.24 per cent of the meas- 
ures, and some kinds of practical use of the normal curve 
permit this. 
While the table states the proportion of measures between 
the mean ordinate and an ordinate at any point on the scale, 
it can be used to compute the proportion between two ordi- 
nates erected at any two points on the scale. For example, if 
we desired to know what proportion of our group fell between  
-P-A-G-E-240
  216 STATISTICAL METHODS 
0.6¢ and 1.80, the arithmetic is straight-forward subtraction, 
as follows: 
Between the mean and 1.80 = 46.41% 
Between the mean and 0.60 = 22.57% 
.'. Between 0.6¢ and 1.80 = 23.84% 
To illustrate the use of the curve in practical school work let 
us give a few concrete cases. 
Use of the normal curve: (a) In distributing the marks of 
pupils’ achievement in school. Refer, here, to the case of 
the superintendent who wished to distribute his pupils’ 
marks somewhat in accordance with the probability curve. 
Three assumptions are necessary: first, that concerning the 
number of groups into which his marks shall be thrown; 
second, that intellectual ability in the high school accorded 
fairly well with the probability curve;! third, that it is 
“practically” justifiable to break off the base line of the 
curve at 2.50. 
Assuming that he wished to group his marks in five groups, 
A, B, C, D, E, each group representing equal intervals of 
ability, how many individuals should get A, B, C, D, and E 
respectively? First: 5 groups A, B, C, D, E, are to be dis- 
tributed equally over the entire scale. A serious question 
arises here because the curve does not meet the z-axis except 
at infinity. However, it approaches it very closely some- 
where about 2.5¢ to 3.00. At what distance shall we break 
off the curve? This is evidently a matter to be determined 
by trial, in order to determine which length of base line 
divided into fifths, gives the best practical working scale 
with which to measure intellectual ability. Let us try cutting 
it off at both 2.50 and 3.0c, comparing the relative frequen- 
cies with both scales, 
Diagrams 35 and 36 give the data for both methods of

fitting the normal curve to the marking system. Breaking 
off the curve at 2.50 and 3.00 respectively neglects 1.24 per 
cent and 0.27 per cent of the measures respectively, and 
gives the following distribution of measures: —

Range=+3.00 3.5 24 AS 24 3.5 
Insufficient comparison of actual distribution of intellectual 
ability objectively determined, has been made as yet to per- 
mit us to make final judgments as to which of these methods 
gives the truer picture of human abilities. There needs to be 
much careful objective testing of mental functions, with very 
intensive comparison of actual with various theoretical dis- 
tributions. The writer has been making such analyses of 
collected data. For practical purposes he regards a five- 
fold distribution with range equal to + 2.50 as reasonably 
representative. This range has been taken by other work- 
ers in the field, notably by Ayres in the design of his Scale 
for Measuring Spelling Ability. It should be pointed out that 
Ayres was the first to make this particular kind of practical 
use of the normal curve in education, in his handwriting 
scale as well as in his spelling scale. 
Use of the normal curve: (b) In determining the difficulty 
of test questions and problems: The traditional method 
of designing school tests has been entirely subjective, and 
generally has involved the equal weighting of all questions 
or problems on the test; — this, too, in spite of the fact that 
problems and questions vary very widely in difficulty. The 
aims of the recent testing movement have included the de- 
termination, as closely as possible, of the real difficulty of 
problems used on Standard Tests. The principles and meth- 
ods of procedure are illustrated in a recent article by the
-P-A-G-E-244
220 STATISTICAL METHODS 
writer,! on the design of test problems in first-year algebra, 
an extract from which will be quoted at this place. 
Principles of design of “verbal ” tests in first-year algebra. 
“In designing tests containing verbal problems: we should 
(a), design tests of verbal problems ranging in degree of difficulty 
from very easy problems (which nearly all pupils will solve cor- 
rectly) to very difficult problems (which but few pupils will solve 
correctly); (b), weight each problem in scoring the ability of pupils 
by determining its relative degree of difficulty; (3) this can be done by 
(a), finding the percentage of a large and representative group of 
pupils that solve each problem correctly; (b), assuming that alge- 
braic abilities are distributed in the general first-year high-school 
population in accordance with some known distribution curve. 
“Working on these hypotheses and principles, lists of verbal prob- 
lems (totaling 51 in all) were drawn up covering the principal types 
of subject-matter named above. As a result of giving the 1915 
tests, problems of widely varying degree of difficulty were included. 
These problems were then worked by 1295 pupils, distributed 
throughout 26 school systems, 17 of which also worked the 11 formal 
tests. As a result of this testing there was determined the percentage 
of the group that worked each problem correctly. In order then to 
determine the relative difficulty of each problem, the assumption 
was made that algebraic ability is distributed fairly closely in ac- 
cordance with the “normal” probability curve. (Intellectual abili- 
ties in the elementary school have been shown to follow this distri- 
bution rather closely. We recognize the possible existence of many 
factors which tend to make the secondary-school curve skewed to 
the high end of the scale. Almost nothing is actually known of the 
amount and direction of their influences, however. The best “‘prac- 
tical guess” that can be made at the present time as to the distribu- 
tion of scholastic abilities is that it corresponds closely enough to 
the curve of error to warrant using the well-worked-out properties 
of that curve in our design.) 
“Let Diagram 11 (Chapter I) represent the distribution of alge- 
braic abilities in the pupils represented by our 27 school systems. 
The base line then represents a ‘scale of algebraic difficulty’ rang- 
ing, let us say, from nearly 0 ability to nearly perfect or 100 per cent

bra”; in School Review, Feb. and March, 1917.

ability. The area between the curve and the base line represents 
the number of pupils in our entire group. If we divide the base line 
into any number of parts, and erect upright lines at the points 
representing these parts, we could determine, from the properties 
of the normal curve, the number of pupils that ought to be found 
between these distances on the base line. 
“Tn the same way we could determine what percentage of our 
group of pupils should be found distributed between the zero- 
point on the base line and any other point. Since the normal curve 
has the property that it actually meets the base line only at infin- 
ity, we are forced to set our 0 and 100 points arbitrarily by deciding 
how large a percentage of the entire group we may drop off at both 
ends of the base line. 
“Taking as our unit of measurement on the base line, sigma, 
the ‘standard deviation’ of the distribution (indicated graphically 
in Diagram 11), and laying it off 2.5 times each way from the mid- 
point of the curve, gives us 5 divisions (which may conveniently 
be divided into 10 divisions corresponding ‘practically’ to our 
public-school marking system). In doing this we are arbitrary to 
the extent of neglecting only 0.62 of 1 per cent of our pupils at each 
end of the base line. If this 0.62 of 1 per cent is thrown into the 
middle of the curve, where the individuals are more closely grouped, 
it is a negligible factor. Calling the point 2.5 X sigma from the 
mid-point 0, setting the mean at 50, and setting the successive 
points 10, 20, 30, etc., to 100, at .5c, 1.c 1.5, etc.; we now havea 
practical working ‘scale of algebraic difficulty’ over the succes- 
sive points of which the corresponding percentages of our pupils 
may be indicated. Doing this, we see in Diagram 11 the proportions 
of our group of pupils that correspond io various degrees of diffi- 
culty on the base line. Thus a problem which is failed by 96.6 per 
cent of the group falls at the point marked 85; that failed by 84.8 
per cent is scored 70, ete., throughout the list. To enable us to mark 
in an accurate way, a table has been computed in which the base 
line has been divided into 500 parts.” 
Probability table and its use. It will be noted that this 
application of the normal curve to school research demands 
a new kind of probability table, — one in which the per- 
centage of total measures between 0 and any selected dis- 
tance on the z-axis, is computed from one end of the range 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  222 STATISTICAL METHODS 
to the other end, instead of from the mean point, either way- 
In order to score problems for difficulty, which have been 
solved correctly by percentages of the entire group of pupils 
varying from nearly 0 per cent to nearly 100 per cent, we 
need a probability table, giving distances on the base line 
corresponding to various percentages of pupils. Tables V 
and VI in the Appendix give such data, having been con- 
structed from Table III by setting 0 arbitrarily at —2.50 
and — 3.0c respectively, and by subtracting the total per- 
centage between the mean and successive points on the z-axis. 
For example, between 0, (— 2.50) and .01o is included .02 
per cent of the total group; between 0 and say .5c is included 
1.66 per cent of the total measures; between 0 and o, 6.06 per 
cent, etc. Thus, if a problem is failed by only 6.06 per cent, 
its difficulty will be indicated by its position on the base line 
of the curve. These values could be stated in multiples and 
parts of ¢, computing from the arbitrarily chosen end of the 
base line at the left. To turn the scores of the problems into 
‘practical’ accordance with the usual percentile marking 
scale, each point on the base line has been transmuted into 
such a 100 per cent scale. To do this the mean has been set 
arbitrarily at 50. Since there are 10 divisions (each .5¢ in 
length) the even points on the scale are as indicated. Thus 
any problem failed by 98.34 per cent of the pupils is scored 
90; that failed by 93.94 per cent is scored 80, and so on over 
the scale. Both Tables V and VI, in the Appendix, and Dia- 
gram 11 give the details of the method. 
5. Use of the normal curve in giving “ credit for quality ” 
Many school systems, at the present time, are giving addi- 
tional credit to those pupils who maintain a high standard in 
their work:.— “credit for quality” the scheme is called. 
For example, in certain schools it has been customary to 
classify marks in five groups, say, — Excellent, Superior,
-P-A-G-E-247
    EDUCATIONAL USE BY FREQUENCY CURVE 223 
Medium, Inferior, and Poor, and to weight these in such a 
proportion as 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, respectively. Such a 
weighting of the different grades is of course entirely arbi- 
trary. In view of the growing interest in this practical prob- 
lem a method will be suggested of weighting ability more 
definitely in accordance with its distribution. 
The method implies two assumptions: First, scholastic 
abilities distribute roughly in accordance with the normal 
curve; second, the school should give credit for achievement 
roughly in inverse proportion to the frequency of the pupils 
who reveal the achievement. In support of this latter, — the 
social world pays most for those things that few of its mem- 
bers can do, — in the same way the school should reward 
most highly those types of achievement that relatively few 
pupils can attain. Having made these two assumptions it 
is possible to present a workable and defensible method of 
crediting various grades of achievement. Since we are deal- 
ing with the probability curve, one other assumption is 
necessary — namely, that concerning the point at which 
we must break off the base line of the curve. In the light of 
what has been said in the foregoing sections we shall as- 
sume, thirdly, that human abilities are best described by a 
distribution (grouped, say, in five groups to accord with prev- 
alent practice) whose range extends from —2.5¢ to + 2.50. 
Turning to Diagrams 35 and 86 we note the relative posi- 
tion of each of the five groups, and that each may be typi- 
fied by the median value of the class-interval which is repre- 
1 The discussion of Section 5, is offered merely as a suggestion for the 
scientific weighting of student-work. The writer wishes to make it clear, 
however, that he is not a protagonist of the doctrine of giving “credit for 
quality.” He regards such a practice as an administrative makeshift which 
would be unnecessary with the proper classification of students and courses 
of study. Rather, would he support the movement to segregate pupils in 
terms of ability with the parallel construction of a marking system which 
will measure abilities adequately.

sented by its portion of the base line of the curve. That 
is, let the entire group be represented by the values, 4.30, 
8.40, etc. In the relative distances of these mean points from 
the zero end of the scale we have a definite suggestion for 
weighting each of the successive grades of ability. Thus, in 
the light of the above assumptions our method would lead 
to the following weights for the various grades of ability: —

  It can be seen that although the absolute values of the mean 
points in terms of ¢ are different, the relative distances are 
the same. 
6. Use of the normal curve to determine the reliability of the 
statistical results obtained from actual data 
Of all the uses to which we put the probability curve we 
now come to the most important, namely — the determina- 
tion of the reliability of statistical measures, such as aver- 
ages, measures of variability, and measures of relationship. 
The student should recognize clearly that he always will 
deal with but a limited number of measures from the total 
group. Thus his computed average, for example, is not the 
“true” average, for the “true” average could be obtained 
only from all of the measures in the entire population. The 
“true” average spelling ability in the sixth grade of a large 
city system could be found only by testing all of the 
20,000 children, say, in all of the sixth grades of the system. 
It is inexpedient, however, to test all, and so we are forced 
to deal with but a “sample” of the total. It has been pointed 
out that, to permit sound conclusions for the whole group
-P-A-G-E-249
  
EDUCATIONAL USE OF FREQUENCY CURVE 225 
from the statistical treatment of “samples,” such samples 
must be “random.” That is, they must be, first, large enough; 
and second, chosen purely by chance, so that statistical meas- 
ures (such as averages) which are computed to represent 
them will not fluctuate seriously in value as successive sam- 
ples are chosen of the same size and in the same manner. 
It is evident that the weak spot in this statement is the 
phrase “will not fluctuate seriously.” At once, we wish 
to know how large is a “serious” fluctuation in the size of 
our constant. Or, more technically, is the deviation large 
enough to be an indication that constant causes are con- 
tributing to our average to such an extent that our sample 
is not random. 
To answer these questions we are forced to turn to the 
theory of probability. Assuming that the entire distribution 
from which our sample data are drawn fits the “probabil- 
ity” curve, and that our successive samples do so also, we can 
make a statement concerning the probable deviation of our 
computed constants from the corresponding “true” values. 
Now, we know that the most probable “error”’ or “devia- 
tion” from a true average, say, is the error or deviation 0. 
That is, if we are computing the average spelling ability of 
our 20,000 pupils by taking successive samples of 200 each, 
the average computed for each sample will be in “error” or 
“deviate” from the true average by some definite amount. 
The best assumption that we can make about the distribu- 
tion of such “errors” is that they accord with the “curve 
of error,” the probability curve. Thus in Diagram 37, we 
can represent the shape of the distribution by placing the 
mode of the probability curve at 0 error. Now, for the sake 
of illustration, assume that each of the 100 successive groups 
of 200 pupils has been tested, that the average achievement 
of each group has been determined, that the “true” average 
achievement of the whole 20,000 has been determined, and
-P-A-G-E-250
226 STATISTICAL METHODS 
likewise the “deviation” of the average of each sample. It 
has been shown in various problems of measurement that 
these 100 deviations or errors will tend to distribute them- 
selves in the form of a probability curve, with the mean at 
the error zero. Suppose, for illustration, that we assume that 
the actual averages computed are given in Table 32.

In this particular case, assuming that such measures of 
successive samples have been computed and plotted, we can 
express the probable deviation of the computed averages 
from the true average by reference to the table. Since 67 per 
cent of the measures fall between actual average values of 
73.5 and 72.9, and 38 per cent fall outside (or, in other words, 
67 per cent show a deviation of less than +.2 per cent), the 
chances are 2 to 1 against a sample of 200 pupils selected at 
random being more than 73.5 and less than 72.9. Since 94 
per cent of the cases fall between 72.6 and 73.9, or within 
a deviation from the true average of + .6, the chances are 
roughly 16 to 1 against the average value of any sample of
-P-A-G-E-251
    EDUCATIONAL USE OF FREQUENCY CURVE 227 
100 pupils being more than 73.9 or less than 72.6. By ex- 
tending our scale of error we can find a “distance on the 
scale” beyond which it is practically certain that the com- 
puted constant will not fall. That is, by reference to the 
theory of probability we can determine the probable extent 
of fluctuation of our computed constant. 
7. Various measures of unreliability 
A. Statement or UNRELIABILITY IN TERMS OF THE 
Sranparp Deviation 
But, finding a “distance on the scale” consists in measuring 
variability and we have two accepted unit measures of varia- 
bility, the standard deviation and the probable error. Hence 
we desire formule by which we can compute the variability 
of the probable deviation of computed measures from corre- 
sponding true measures. Assuming the probability curve as 
the form of the distribution of the deviations, formule have 
been derived mathematically for the standard deviation of 
an average. for the standard deviation of a standard devia- 
tion, for the standard deviation of a coefficient of correla- 
tion, and for other measures of a distribution. Note that 
such measures are really measures of unreliability. 
(a) Unreliability of an arithmetic mean. The standard 
deviation of the deviation of a computed average from a 
true average (cy,) may be computed from 
_ CP distribution

that is, it is equal to the standard deviation of the actual 
distribution of original measures divided by the square root 
of tle number of measures. Diagram 37 illustrates its 
meaning.

able deviations theoretically will be included between tou, 
t.é., +.2. It was shown above that 99.73 per cent of the 
probable deviations will be included between +3c,y, i.e., 
between +.6. This is interpreted to mean that the chances 
are about 9973 to 27, 7.¢., about 365 to 1, that the average 
of any such sample selected at random will fall between 
73.2+.6, i.e., between 72.6 and 73.8. 
(b) Unreliability of a standard deviation. In the same 
way we may express the probable deviation of a computed

  EDUCATIONAL USE OF FREQUENCY CURVE 229 
standard deviation from the true standard deviation, using 
the formula: — 
Geum: distribution S deviation ino = Rane (2) 2. 
The formula and method of computation may be inter- 
‘preted graphically in the same way as before, remembering 
now that the deviations to be plotted on the scale are prob- 
able deviations of the observed o’s from the true c. 
(c) Unreliabilty of a difference between two measures. 
Similarly, the unreliability of a difference between two quan- 
tities may be expressed in terms of the probable deviation 
of the true difference from the computed difference. It can 
be shown that the standard deviation of this probable de- 
viation of the difference between two measures equals the 
square root of the sum of the squares of the probable devia- 
tions of each true measure from its corresponding computed 
measure. That is, —

The graphic interpretation will be clear to the student pro- 
vided it is remembered that the scale of the base line of the 
curve is now, “deviations in the size of the computed correla- 
tion coefficient from the size of the true correlation coefli- 
cient.”   
B. Statement or UNRELIABILITY IN TERMS OF THE 
PropaBLe Error 
It has been noted that there are two accepted unit 
measures of variability, the standard deviation (c) and

the probable error, P.E. The relation between the two can 
be shown to be 
P.E. = 67449 7 (5) 
This relationship can be made clear by turning to Table III, 
which states the fractional part of the area between the 
mean of the normal curye and ordinates erected at distances 
from the mean equal to successive increments of ¢. For 
example, between the mean and ¢ will fall 34.134 per cent 
of the entire distribution. We define the probable error as 
that unit distance on the scale which, if laid off one way from 
the mean, will determine one fourth of the cases. Therefore 
we can determine from the table the fractional part of ¢ that 
one will lay off from the mean to determine 2500/10,000 
of the area of the curve. This proves to be .67449 o, or 
approximately .6745 >. 
Because of the “common sense”’ meaning of the probable 
error (namely, that distance which if laid off both ways from 
the mean determines half the cases) it has become custom- 
ary to express the unreliability of measures in terms of the 
probable error instead of the standard deviation. Thus 
the above formulze become: —

different scales are chosen for X and Y. Plot the three curves on one sheet 
and use your own judgment in selecting the units for X and Y. 
2. For the following data, plot a frequency polygon, choosing scales 
on X and Y that will give as large a graph as possible and a reasonably 
“steep” curve. Superimpose a NORMAL CURVE on this polygon to per- 
mit comparison of the actual distribution with the theoretical distribution.

CHAPTER IX 
THE MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP : CORRELATION 
Practical need for measures of relationship. The pre- 
vious chapters have put before us the three methods of 
treating a single distribution of educational data: (1) that 
of picturing its status by computing some average to repre- 
sent it; (2) that of picturing its degree of concentration by 
computing some measure of variability or dispersion; (3) 
that of graphically picturing the entire distribution by plot- 
ting the frequency polygon, column diagram, or smoothed 
frequency curve that may be taken to represent the most 
probable statement of the true situation typified by our 
sample. It was found that if one desired to compare the 
status of two distributions he could use these methods of 
averages, dispersion, and frequency curves to give a com- 
plete picture of either distribution alone, or of the one com- 
pared with the other. It is probably true that most of the 
actual administrative problems faced by the practical school 
man may involve the use of these statistical methods, and 
only these. However, in the analytical experimental study 
of problems of learning and teaching, and of some admin- 
istrative problems, a new type of device is demanded, — 
namely, some method of determining the degree of causal 
connection exhibited by certain traits or activities in which 
we are interested. The measuring of physical, mental, and 
social activities constantly involves the study of causation 
or causal Gonnection between two or more traits in ques- 
tion. The massing of data in this study of causation raises 
the necessity for statistical methods of computing degrees 
of causal connection.
-P-A-G-E-258
    234 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Suppose, for example, that we were interested in the prac- 
tical problem of classifying pupils in school in terms of 
abilities. One of the questions for which we desire answers 
would be: Are “school” abilities specialized, or general? Is 
wt probable that a pupil who shows a high degree of achieve- 
ment in one subject of study, say mathematics, will show 
a high degree of achievement in another subject, say mod- 
ern languages? ‘To illustrate the problem: the data of 
Table 33 represent the actual school marks given a class 
of 23 high-school pupils in mathematics and modern lan- 
guages. Each mark in the table is the average of three or 
more marks in the respective subject.

  To answer our question we now have for each pupil in 
the class a pair of records of achievement, t.¢., his average 
mark in mathematics, and his average mark in modern lan- 
guages. If, now, there were absolutely perfect correspond- 
ence, or “correlation”’ as we shall call it, in the two abilities in 
question, and assuming for the time being that the school 
marks of these pupils adequately measure their respective 
abilities, each pupil should occupy the same relative posi- 
tion in the two series of marks; — .e., the pupil first in 
mathematics should be first in languages, the pupil second 
in mathematics should be second in languages, and so on 
through the list. Table 34 shows this situation by giving

  236 STATISTICAL METHODS 
two hypothetical series of marks. This method of measur- 
ing the degree of correspondence between two traits obviously 
takes account only of the position of the various measures in 
the series. It neglects the absolute amounts of the measures. 
Not only should the position be the same for each pupil 
in the two series, but, in order that the correspondence be 
absolutely perfect, the actual proportional differences be- 
tween each two consecutive marks ought to be the same. 
It is clear that merely to rank the measures in the two 
series in order of size and to compare the corresponding 
ranks does not accurately measure the degree of corre- 
spondence; i.¢., it does not take full account of the absolute 
value of each measure. 
Need of devices to show correspondence. For this reason 
we need devices for picturing the correspondence between 
the actual measures which will take full account of the 
actual amount of each one. For example, let us take the 
pairs of marks in Table 33. In Chapter IV it was pointed 
out that a distribution can be completely represented by 
graphic methods, — by plotting the data. Let us plot the data 
of Table 33. By what graphic methods can we now com- 
bine pairs of measures in the same diagram to show the 
correspondence between two varying traits? Recall here 
that in the preceding chapters we have been plotting 
single distributions by laying off the units of scale on the 
horizontal (X) axis, and the corresponding numbers of meas- 
ures on the vertical (Y) axis. In the plotting of the single 
distribution, therefore, we deal with but two quantities, 
—the value of magnitude of the measures, and the fre- 
quency with which each occurred. We now have two fre- 
quency distributions, each having a@ scale along which the 
measures are distributed, and a set of frequencies. It is 
possible to combine the two distributions, however, on two 
coérdinate axes because they have one element in common
-P-A-G-E-261
MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 237 
— the frequency column. If, now, we construct a double- 
entry table, like that in Diagram 38, in which the a-axis 
represents, let us say, the scale of abilities in mathematics 
and the y-axis, the scale of abilities in modern languages, it 
is possible to represent on this squared table every pair of

measures in Table 33. Furthermore, as we do this we can 
see that each measure is represented in accordance with 
both its absolute amount and position in the series. To 
illustrate:

usage in plotting pairs of measures involves two coérdinate

    238 STATISTICAL METHODS 
axes, one horizontal (OX), and the other vertical (OY), 
meeting at an “origin” or beginning point at the bottom and 
left. One of these axes, say OX, is chosen on which to lay 
off the scale of one of the traits in question, and the other 
axis to lay off the scale of the other trait. The selection of 
which trait to plot on a particular axis is left to the arbi- 
trary choice of the student. The units of the scale are now 
laid off from the origin to the right on OX, and upward on 
OY.' It is now possible to represent to scale a pair of 
measures, by plotting the value of one on the z-axis, and 
that of the other on the y-axis. Erecting perpendiculars to 
the x and y axes gives us a point as the intersection. When 
considered with respect to the distance which it is from either 
base line, OX and O Y, this point represents the pair of meas- 
ures in question. 
For example, in Diagram 38 a point, determined by per- 
pendiculars erected at distances 50 units from the origin on 
OX and 58 units from the origin on OY, represents the pair 
of marks given pupil A in Table 33, 50 in mathematics and 
58 in modern languages. Similarly with pupil B, repre- 
sented by a point 78 units to the right of OY and 58 units 
above OX; and pupils C, D, ete. It should be noted, that 
in Diagram 38, although the scaling of distances is correct, 
the entire table down and over to the origin is not given. 
Theoretically, of course, each point on the table is referred 
to axes OX and OY, assumed to be at zero. 
Diagram 38 now becomes ‘clear to us. Each point on 
the diagram represents a pair of measures on a pupil. All 
the points, considered together, typify the degree of corre- 
pondence of correlation between the two abilities. A glance 
at the table tells us these things: (1) in general, pupils who 
1 This method of plotting is in contrast to those of many educational 
workers in statistical methods, but more consistent with standard algebraic 
practice.
-P-A-G-E-263
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 289 
stand high or low in one ability stand high or low in the 
other; (2) there are three pupils in the class for whom very 
low achievements in languages accompany high or moderate 
achievements in mathematics. For the remaining 20 pupils 
the correspondence is rather close. In clarifying the situa- 
tion for the investigator, however, the actual plotting of the 
table indicates at once, and in a much more definite way 
than does the ranking of Table 33, the absolute amount and 
relative position of each pair of measures. This method 
of treating the data points out that we are primarily inter- 
ested in changes in the size of one variable corresponding to 
changes in the size of the other. 
If we plot the data of Table 34 (rank correlation perfect) 
we have a distribution of pairs of measures as in Diagram 39. 
As we glance over the rank order of these 23 measures we 
note perfect correspondence in change of position of the pairs 
of measures in the two series; 7.c., pupil N is 14th in both 
series, pupil A is first in both, W is last in both, M is 13th in 
both, etc. Diagram 39, though, gives this information con- 
cerning change in position and, in addition, shows the changes 
in magnitude of the various pairs of measures. It is noted, for 
example, that the four smaller measures beginning with 
66, 65; 65, 60; 64, 55; and 63, 50; show a much smaller de- 
crease in the size of the «-variable (i.e., achievement in 
mathematics) than in the size of the y-variable (achieve- 
ment in modern languages). This type of eccentricity in 
distributions, which would not be revealed by mere rank- 
ing methods, shows up clearly in the complete plotting of 
the table. 
Few- and many-pair correlations. Changes in the distri- 
tion of measures in a correlation-table which contains but 
relatively few pairs of measures, for example, 23 as above, 
can be comprehended rather easily. It is probable that a 
fairly adequate interpretation could be made of the general

change in magnitude of these two variables, and expressed 
in word form. However, the expression certainly would be 
vague and consist in statements something like the fol- 
‘lowing: “Large achievements in mathematics seem to be 
accompanied by large achievements in modern languages.

There are certain exceptional cases, however, in which the

contain many measures, several hundred or several thousand 
in some cases. It is evident that we cannot deal adequately 
with the separate pairs of measures which are plotted in 
Diagram 40. Furthermore, as we increase the number of 
measures in the table the scattering of a few pairs of 
measures away from the mass has less and less effect on 
our interpretation of the general situation.

Grouping of correlated data. Now in discussing the 
treatment of the frequency distribution it was pointed out 
that the single measures may be grouped in class-intervals. 
In order to condense two distributions which have been 
plotted on the two axes of a double-entry table we resort 
to the same procedure — we group the measures on each 
axis in class-intervals. Doing that with a table like that

must recall that the assumption is made that all measures 
in each square (representing an interval on each axis) are 
assumed to be grouped at the mean point of the square. 
This point is determined as the point common to the means 
of both axes, x and y, of the square. In Diagram 41 the

mathematics. Again, inspection of such a table enables 
general statements to be made concerning the degree of re- 
lationship between the two traits. From the general trend 
of the table it is evident that abilities in mathematics are 
directly related to abilities in languages.

Discovering laws of relationship. Inspection of a corre- 
lation table is not sufficient to tell us in a definite way, how- 
ever, to what degree the two are related. If for example we 
have two correlation tables, rather similar in “scatter,” it 
is difficult to determine by inspection of the table in which 
case the correlation is the more perfect. Facing such a table 
upon which large numbers of measures are scattered we at 
once feel the need for some device for condensing the measures, 
— the need of devising an average or typical measure which 
will adequately represent the status of all the pairs of records

taken together. Just as averages and measures of disper- 
sion typify a single distribution, so we wish a device which 
will succinctly and yet most completely describe the whole 
correlation table. 
This necessary device can be constructed by turning to 
the columns and rows of the table. Each column or row 
(either of which may be called an “ array”) may be regarded 
as a separate frequency distribution, and as such may be 
typified by an average point on its scale. _Remembering

I. Tue Case or Srraicut-Line RevationsHrp 
1. The first method of determining relationship 
Galton’s graphic method. One’s first tendency would be 
to deal with the graphic representation of the law — the 
line of relationship. ‘That is what Galton did in his pioneer 
and suggestive study thirty years ago. 
In Diagram 43, drawn for the data of Diagram 42 (ability 
in languages and mathematics), the scales on the x and y 
axes have been so taken that Q3—Q: (for ability in languages) 
represents the same distance on x-axis as Q3 — Q: (for math- 
ematics) on the y-axis. The points Q3 and Q: have been 
plotted by erecting perpendiculars to OX and OY from 
the respective Qs’s and Q1’s on X andon Y. The heavy lines 
in the diagram represent coérdinates drawn through the 
medians of both distributions. Their intersection is the 
median of the table. Under these conditions, and since 
the units of the scales on the two axes are the same, the line 
drawn through Q3, Q1 is the line of perfect correlation. In 
this case, it is at 45° to the horizontal base line. 
Galton next drew a line to approximate as closely as 
possible the mean points of the actual pairs of measures in the 
columns (shown by the crosses). This line is seen to deviate 
from the line of perfect correlation. Then in the figure any 
horizontal line AB, is drawn from the median line, cutting 
A the two lines Q1Q3 and DB. The ratio o measures the 
amount of correspondence in change in the two variables. 
For every point on the line of perfect correlation, a given

change in the size of y is accompanied by a proportional 
change in the size of x. For every point on the line which 
best fits the means of the “arrays” a given change in the 
size of y is accompanied by a somewhat larger change in

the size of x. It is clear that if the two lines in the diagram 
coincide, then ——~ equals 1 and the correlation may be said AC 
to be perfect and positive. If the line of the means is verti- 
eis , i AB R cal, coinciding with the median, then —— becomes 0; i.e., AC
-P-A-G-E-271
  
MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 247 
a given change in the size of y is accompanied by no change 
in the size of x. As the line of the means swings over to the left 
of the vertical median, and its direction becomes downward 
from left to right, the correlation evidently becomes nega- 
tive. That is, a given increase in the size of y results in a de- 
crease in the size of xand vice versa. Finally when the line 
falls at right angles to Q:Q3 a becomes — 1 and correla- 
tion is perfect, but negative. 
Thus Galton’s method enables us to measure graphically 
the degree of ‘ico-relation,” or correspondence between two 
traits. Galton applied his method to the measurement of in- 
heritance of stature by computing the coefficient of “co- 
relation” between the stature of children and the stature of 
their parents (the stature of the two parents being aver- 
aged in each case to give the “mid-parent ’’). He found this 
coefficient (the ratio described in the foregoing paragraphs) 
2 ‘ 4 i to be 3: This may be interpreted to mean that if the av- 
erage stature of a group of parents is found to be, say y 
inches above or below the general average of the race, the 
2 
average stature of their children will be only 32 inches 
above .or below the mean of the race. Galton expressed 
this By saying that the mean heights of offspring tended 
to “regress back toward the mean of the race.” Since his 
time other workers in biological statistics have used his 
term “regression,” and now it is common to speak of the 
line of the means of the correlation table as the line of regres- 
sion. The ratio described above has come to be called 
the coefficient-of-correlation, and is denoted by r.

2. Second method of determining the law of relationship 
Finding the equation of a straight line of regression. Re- 
fined comparative work in statistics demands a more accu- 
rate method of determining the law of relationship exhibited 
by two traits than that of graphic measurement. We said 
above that the law of relationship is described by the 
“best-fitting” or “most representative” line of the table, 
i.e., by the line which fits most closely the mean points of the 
columns of the “arrays.” Now, the most definite way by 
which we can describe 
a line is to write its 
. P42) equation. Since most 
' of our educational in- 
+ vestigationsgivetables 
whose means approxi- 
mate closely a straight 
line, we shall confine 
our discussion for the 
time being to that 
type. 
In order to write its 
equation we must be 
able to put two vari- 
able quantities, say X 
and Y, together in an 
algebraic expression in- 
such a way that a 
given change in the value of one, say 2, is accompanied 
by a proportional change in the value of the other, y. For 
example, in Diagram 44, a series of points are plotted, 
each of which represents a pair of measurements, and each 
of which “satisfies” the equation of the line. That is, 
point P “represents,” or is plotted from x = + 4, y = 
+ 2; point @ represents s = — 4, y = +3. The line 1 ye eo

PQ could be completely described, therefore, by stating 
the pairs of codrdinates of any two of its points, say 
P (4, 2); and Q( — 4, 3). It will be noted that plotting 
a line, just like plotting separate points, consists in refer- 
ring each point on it to the axes from which it is plotted. 
One characteristic of the straight line stands out, however, 
— all the points on this line have the property that the ratio 
of their codrdinates, es is always the same, regardless of the 
a 
location of the point on the line. This ratio, we is the tan- x 
gent of the angle that the line makes with the horizontal 
axis. Since it measures the inclination of the line it is 
called the “slope,” and is denoted by “m.” 
With this knowledge we can now write the equation of any 
line by making, since m = . y = maz. mis called a “factor 
of proportionality.” In the line plotted in Diagram 34, m is 
evidently 4. Thus, the equation of this line is, 
y=4a+b 
and the diagram shows that taking any value for 2, and 
computing the corresponding value for y gives a series of 
points, all of which fall upon this same straight line. The 
general slope form of the equation of a straight line is 
y=me+b 
in which b is the ordinate of the point of intersection of the 
line and the axis of Y. In Diagram 34 it is 8. 
Finding the equation for a correlation group. If we de- 
sire, now, to develop an equation or a coefficient which will 
describe adequately a “scatter” diagram, or correlation- 
table, it must be an equation which will measure in some way 
the deviation of every point on the table from the means of the
-P-A-G-E-274
  250 STATISTICAL METHODS 
corresponding rows and columns. The significant point for 
the student to master is this: — closeness of correlation may 
be measured in terms of the relative amount of deviation’ of each 
point from the mean of the column and from the mean of the 
row in which tt falls. A table in which the measures show 
a high degree of correlation will be one in which the 
points are closely concentrated around the line of the means, 
— the deviations are small, as in Diagram 39. A table which 
shows a lower degree of correlation will reveal the measures as 
being very much scattered away from the line of the means, 
—the deviations are relatively large, as in Diagram 38. 
In discussing the measurement of dispersion, however, we 
found that, for the deviations of measures in two dis- 
tributions to be comparable, they must be measured in 
terms of some unit deviation. The accepted unit of devia- 
tion we found to be the standard deviation. Hence our 
algebraic expression must measure deviations from the means 
in units of the respective standard deviations. 
Now, clearly, the line which “best fits” the means of the 
“arrays” is that line for which the deviations of the means 
are the least possible. From the standpoint of convenience 
an equation may be derived for this line by assuming the cri- 
terion from “least squares,” that the sum of the squares of 
the deviations of the means, each weighted by the number 
of measures in the respective array, shall be a minimum. 
This is exactly what has been done by Professor Karl 
Pearson who has derived the equation of this best-fitting 
line. The fundamental conceptions underlying the method, 
however, are Bravais’s, who in 1846 suggested that the cor- 
respondence of two quantities could be represented in terms 
of the product-sum of the deviations from the respective means. 
No single coefficient or equation was established at that 
time, to represent the degree of the correspondence. In 
1896, Pearson published his product-moment method of
-P-A-G-E-275
  
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 251 
computing correlation, and gave us the equation of the line 
of regression and the coefficient of correlation. 
Pearson’s equation. Working on the criterion named 
above, Pearson deduced the equation for the “best fitting” 
line as: 
n- gar (e,-3) (1) 
in which y and % are the mean values of the columns and 
rows respectively; o, and ,are the standard deviations of 
the two distributions, and r is the very important statistical 
device known as the coefficient of correlation. 
The equation is variously given in two forms, one that 
stated in equation (1), and the other that stated as follows: 
oy Ui cae (2) 
in which y and x are now deviations of particular y and x 
measures from the means of the respective arrays. In other 
words y = y,; — y, and r= x, —z%. The student should 
familiarize himself with these two equations, as they are 
of the first importance. The theory on which they are 
built has led to a description of a line that safely may be 
regarded as the most probable statement of the “law” repre- 
sented by the data. 
Now, we note a new term in these equations — r, the cor- 
relation coefficient. We noted in the preceding section that 
r was the ratio a in Diagram 43. Furthermore we said 
above that if the law represented by the data were typified 
by the “best-fitting line,” the equation of the line must take 
account definitely of the corresponding x and y deviation of 
each point on the table. The process of deriving the equation 
of the line led to this more detailed statement of the equa- 
tion: —

(a) The significance of r—the coefficient of correlation. 
This brief mathematical statement has been given to permit 
us to make clear the real significance of r, the so-called “co- 
efficient of correlation.” 7 serves two specific functions in 
the determination of relationship. 
(1) It is a single index, a pure number, which measures 
the degree of “scatter” or of concentration of the data, by 
giving the mean product of the deviations of each of the meas- 
ures from the mean value of its “array,” when measured in 
units of the standard deviation. Stated in terms of such de- 
viations (x and y) r is more simply expressed as: — 
3 cy 
No,o   
r=
-P-A-G-E-277
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 253 
We note that the deviation (z, or y) of each measure from 
its respective mean is measured in units of its respective 
standard deviation by dividing it by o, or oy. Say is 
evidently Bravais’s product-sum of the deviations. Thus in 
this single numerical coefficient, 7, we express relationship 
in terms of the mean values of the two traits by measuring 
the amount each individual deviates from its respective mean. 
The formula for r is generally called the product-moment 
formula. This will be explained later by reference to Dia- 
gram 46. 
(2) ris an intermediate device. In defining the second func- 
tion of r, we note that it is merely an intermediate numerical 
device, defined as it is for the purpose of bringing together, 
in one convenient expression, certain terms collected in 
the process of developing the law of regression. Thus, it is 
really only an intermediate expression in the ultimate math- 
ematical process of expressing the law of relationship in terms 
of the equation of the line of regression. On the other hand, it 
may have for the lay student a more definite connotation 
than the equational or algebraic expression for the line itself 
which really represents the relationship; e.g., — 
oy y=r Fe c 
To the mathematician this expression has a specific con- 
notation; to the non-mathematical student a vague and 
unsatisfying one. Largely for that reason, students of edu- 
cational research have neglected the equational expression 
for relationship, and have adopted the single numerical co- 
efficient r. It should be noted, however, that once having 
determined r, the regression equation of the line of the means 
can be expressed very simply by substituting the values of 
?, oz and c, in the equation above. 
Furthermore, we said that such an equation was ex-
-P-A-G-E-278
254 STATISTICAL METHODS 
pressed in the “slope” form, y = mz in which m is the 
“slope” or tangent of the angle that the line makes with 
the horizontal. Thus in the regression equation, — 
oy oF 
Cx 
and this, in those cases in which the rw of the two 
traits is the same, becomes equal to r. ra + is known as the 
regression coefficient of y on a, that is, the deviation of y 
corresponding on the average to a unit change in the type of 
zx, and is represented by b,, or b;. In the same way r = is y 
the regression coefficient of x on y, is represented by b,, or 
bo, and means that deviation of x which corresponds to a 
unit change in the type of y. 
(b) What is the meaning of the coefficient of correla- 
tion and the regression coefficients? Statistical measures are 
computed only for the purpose of clarifying our interpreta- 
tion of complex masses of data. It has been pointed out re- 
peatedly in the foregoing chapters that such devices do not 
supply proofs of existing relationships, —rather that they 
are merely tools to refine our analysis of numerical situations, 
and that they are valuable only in so far as they agree with 
sound logical analysis. So it is with statistical devices for 
measuring correlation. The mind demands a tool for de- 
fining the extent of correlation shown by a vast number of 
pairs of measures on the two traits in question. A coefficient 
designed to measure relationship is valuable to the extent 
that it does this. 
Our next problem therefore should be to show the com- 
mon-sense significance of the correlation coefficient, and of 
the regression coefficients, and to indicate the relative degree 
to which they aid us in interpretation of our data. Suppose 
from the example given in Diagram 46, —  
-P-A-G-E-279
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 255 
r= 48; o, = 1.26; o, = 0.89, 
then, 
r= 68, and r= 0.34. Oy Oy 
Then 
y = 68a and z= 34y. 
In this problem we have three statements to aid us in the 
interpretation of the question: To what extent is ability 
in shop practice accompanied by ability in drawing, or vice 
versa. In the first place, we may use the value of the corre- 
lation coefficient r = .48. The question arises: What does 
this mean? Is there a direct relationship between the two 
abilities? If so, is there an indication of considerable rela- 
tionship, little relationship, or no relationship? The sign of 
the correlation coefficient, which in this case is positive, 
answers the first question definitely. This positive sign 
means that any increase in one trait is accompanied by an 
increase in the other, and vice versa. Had the sign of r been 
negative, then an increase in, say x, would have been ac- 
companied by a decrease in y, and vice versa. 
To make clear the meaning of various values of r, suppose 
each series of measures had been ranked in order of size, as 
in Table 33. If the position of each measure were the 
same in both series (i.e., if pupil A were first in both series, 
pupil B second in both series, pupil C third, etc., throughout), 
then the correlation between the two traits would be perfect 
and positive, and r would be + 1. On the other hand, if the 
order of the pupils in the two series were exactly reversed 
(i.e., the first pupil in one series should be the last in the 
other series, the second in one series should be the second 
last in the other series, etc.), then the correspondence 
(“correlation’’) again would be perfect but this time nega- 
tive, and 7 would equal — 1. Again, if there should be no 
correspondence in the position of the measures in the two
-P-A-G-E-280
  256 STATISTICAL METHODS 
series, the value of r woul be 0. Thus the value of r may 
range from — 1 to + 1. When between 0 and 1 it will 
“express a tendency, greater or less according to 7’s size, for 
measures above the mean position in one series to be above 
the mean position in the other series. When r is between 
0 and — 1, it will express a tendency, greater or less, accord- 
ing as r is numerically greater or less, for the measures above 
the mean position of one series to be below the mean position 
in the other, and conversely.”” The exact degree of relation- 
ship is commonly inferred from the relative size of the co- 
efficient, r. Thus correlation may be spoken of as “high,” 
“low,” etc. It can be seen that the definite interpretation 
of correlation depends on the arbitrary placing of the limits 
of the values of r, which are to be called “high,” “low,” ete. 
‘High ” and ‘‘low’’ correlation. This definition of 
limits depends largely on the personal experience of the 
person making the interpretation. For example, it has been 
common for certain educational investigators to arbitrarily 
interpret a coefficient of .25 as an indication of “high” posi- 
tive correlation, and one of .40.as “very high.” Others would 
interpret .25 as very low, and .50 as “marked”’ or “some- 
what high.” Certainly, our educational conclusions must 
‘be colored by our arbitrary definition of such a coefficient. 
The experience of the present writer in examining many 
correlation tables has led him to regard correlation as “‘neg- 
ligible” or “‘indifferent”’ when r is less than .15 to .20; as 
being “present but low” when r ranges from .15 or .20 to .35 
or .40; as being “markedly present” or “marked,” when r 
ranges from .35 or .40 to .50 or .60; as being “high” when 
it is above .60 or .70. With the present limitations on educa- 
tional testing few correlations in testing will run above 
-70, and it is safe to regard this as a very high coefficient. 
The interpretation of the coefficient > = .48, in the above 
problem, would result in a general statement to this effect:
-P-A-G-E-281
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 257 
“There is marked evidence that abilities in shop practice and 
drawing accompany each other. Students above the average 
in one group will TEND to be above the average in the other. 
It is not known more specifically in what way the two abili- 
ties are centrally connected, or to what extent the presence 
of either one is an indication of the presence of the other.” 
Except in the case in which the variability is the same, r 
does not enable us to foretell, for example, knowing the 
value of one trait, what, on the average, the value of the 
other will be. It.does not enable us to say that for a given 
unit-change in abilities in shop practice, what changes should 
be expected, on the average, in drawing abilities. 
Amore complete method of describing relationship. This 
very vagueness in the possibility of definition of r leads us 
to turn to the more complete method of describing the re- 
lationship. namely, the equation of the line. Taking that, 
we now find that, for the regression of y on x, — 
y = 68x, 
and that for every unit deviation from the type of x (abili- 
ties in shop practice), it is most probable that there will be an 
accompanying deviation of .68 as much in y (abilities in 
drawing). The tendency, in the past, has been to stop the 
analysis of the data at this point, the conclusion being drawn 
that the two abilities are very closely related. It must be 
remembered, however, that there are two regression lines, 
one for the means of the columns and the other for the means 
of the rows. The former shows the deviation in y correspond- 
ing on the average to a unit deviation in the type of 2, and 
the latter the deviation in x corresponding, on the average, 
to a unit deviation in the type of y. Thus, in our problem, 
x = .84y; i.e., it is probable that a unit deviation in y will 
be accompanied by a deviation of .84 as much in z. 
This explanation has made use of the “deviation ” formula 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  258 STATISTICAL METHODS 
(2). Using the formula (10) in which y and z are actual values 
instead of deviations, we can make this still clearer to the 
student. The equation now becomes 
  1.26 y — 85.55 = 48.1 gp (7 — 85.25) 
na 
y — 85.55 = .68 (a — 85.25) 
In this case, it must be remembered that 2 and y are actual 
values of the two traits, abilities in shop practice and draw- 
ing, and for y and « have been substituted the values of 
their respective means, y = 85.55; « = 85.25. Expressing 
the equation of the line of the means now enables us to 
assign values to one of the traits, say x, and compute the 
accompanying value of y. In Table 35, values decreasing 
by 5 have been assigned to x, and the y’s computed. It 
will be noted that as each x decreases by 5 (90, 85, 80, 75, 
etc.), the corresponding decrease in the unit of y is .68 x 
5 = 3.40. 
TABLE 35. REGRESSION TaBLeE 36. REGRESSION 
OF x ON y OF y ON & 
  
  This should make clear the statement made above that a 
given deviation in x would be accompanied by .68 as much
-P-A-G-E-283
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 259 
change in y. In the same way Table 36 gives corresponding 
values for y and z computed from the regression equation 
of y on x: — 
aw — 85.25 = .34 (y — 85.55). 
The effect of the smaller regression coefficient (.34 instead of 
.68), is now seen in the relative values of y and x. As y de- 
creases steadily by 5 units, x decreases by only 1.70 units 
(.84 x 5 = 1.70). Reference to Diagram 46 will reveal the 
way in which differences in relationship between the two 
traits are partially described by the “slope” of the line of 
the means. The plotting of the equation of the line of the 
means of the columns, — 
y = 68x 
gives a line of considerable steepness, CC’. For given 
changes in x we have nearly proportional changes in y. The 
plotting of the equation of the line of the means of rows, — 
x= 3B4y, 
gives a line much flatter in slope, R,R:. For given changes 
in y we have much smaller changes in a. 
(c) How to plot the line of the means. We are now in a 
position to draw the line of regression on our correlation 
table. There are two methods by which this may be done. 
The first is the rough method of drawing, from inspection 
of the mean points of the columns and rows, a line which 
most closely approximates them. This can be done by lay- 
ing a celluloid triangle, or a thread over the table, and ad- 
justing it by eye until it most closely fits the mean points of 
the columns and rows. The line may be drawn accurately, 
however, by first computing the equations of the lines of 
the means. Values may then be assigned to 2, and corre- 
sponding values of y can then be computed, exactly as in 
Tables 35 and 36. Since a straight line can be plotted from 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
260 STATISTICAL METHODS 
any two of its points, we can draw the line by plotting any 
two of the pairs of coérdinates, x and y. For example, in 
Table 39, the line CC’ is determined by connecting C’ 
(which was plotted from « = 90, y = 88.88) and C (plotted 
from v = 60, y = 68.38). The remaining points of the table 
will fall on the same line, since their codrdinates have been 
computed from the equation of this line.! 
3. Computation of the correlation coefficient and the 
regression coefficients 
It is now clear that statistical methods can supply us 
with a tool for estimating relationship in terms of the most 
probable values of two concurrently changing quantities. 
The determination of the law of relationship must lead to 
the computation of the regression coefficients. This in turn de- 
mands the computation of the correlation coefficient r, which, 
in itself, will throw some light on the status of relationship. 
There are two principal steps in the computation of these 
coefficients: (1) the tabulation of the correlation table; 
(2) the computation of three devices, o,, ¢,, and 7, with the 
consequent substitution of these values in the regression 
equations. 
(a) The first step: the tabulation of the correlation table. 
The foregoing pages have made it clear that complete in- 
terpretation of correlation demands the tabulation of each 
of the pairs of measures in the correlation table. The steps 
in the tabulation may be conveniently listed as follows: ~ 
(1) Decide on the size and position of the class-intervals 
in each distribution. This should be done in accordance 
with the principles laid down in Chapter IV, in the discussion   1 The more refined methods of fitting lines to plotted data, involving, 
as they do, the theory of curve-fitting, will not be taken up in this work. 
In the bibliography at the end of the book complete directions are given 
the mathematically trained student for finding the literature. 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  
MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 261 
of the classification of data in a single frequency distribution. 
The student must understand that he is now to tabulate pairs 
of measures which occur in two sets of class-intervals at the 
same time. 
(2) Write the limits of these class-intervals along the two 
axes of the table, assigning one trait to y and the other to z. 
Lay off these limits 
from a zero point, 
supposed to be at 
the bottom and left 
of the table, as in 
Diagram 45; e.9., 
61-65, 66-70, etc., 
from bottom up, 
and 71-75, 76-80, 
ete., from left to 
right. 
(3) Having the 
original measures 
arranged in parallel 
series, as in Table 
83, tabulate these 
pairs of measures 
in the appropriate 
rectangle in which 
they fall. It will be 
helpful to have the 
y-series on the left, 
and the z-series on 
the right in this 
pairing of the meas-

of correlation r and the regression coefficients, b, and bo.

The work may be made clear by first listing the steps in 
the computation of r. The formula requires us to find the 
two standard deviations, ¢,, for the total frequency columns 
of the y’s, and ¢, for the total frequency rows of z’s. The 
student’s first difficulty in understanding the computation 
will be in comprehending clearly that o, and o, are the stand- 
ard deviations of the total frequency distribution of the columns 
and rows. Thus, in Diagram 46, the column and row headed 
f, and f, mean respectively “total frequency of the y’s” and 
“total frequency of the x’s.” Thus, the standard deviations, 
o, and go, are found from these two frequency distributions 
exactly as described in Chapter VI. Furthermore, the short 
method of computation can be applied to the two distribu- 
tions to cut down greatly the labor of computation, not 
only for the standard deviations but also for Sxy. 
Steps in the computations. The entire steps in the compu- 
tation are as follows (compare Diagram 46 for illustrative 
references) : — 
1. Total the measures in each distribution, giving N. 
2. Estimate the class-interval which contains the mean, ¢.g., 
86-90 for the y’s; 81-85 for the 2’s. 
8. Tabulate the deviation in unit intervals, of the mid-value 
of each class-interval from that of the estimated mean, 1, 2, 
3, etc., — 1, — 2, — 3, ete. 
4. Multiply each frequency by its respective deviation; e.g., 
for the y’s, 4X 2 = 8, 37 X 1 = 87, etc., for the a’s, 6 X —2 = 
— 12, 26 X —1= — 26, etc.

S2'y’ is computed in the same units. It will cut down the 
labor of computation greatly to do this. Note, furthermore,

That is, for each of these two measures 2’y’=1 x 2. For 
the measures in the compartment y= 96-100, x= 91-95, 2’y’

=8 [1 x —2]= —16. Note carefully that the signs of the 
deviations must be taken account of. These signs are now 
determined by noting whether the measure in question is 
greater than or less than the mean of the total distribution. 
A measure greater than the mean will deviate positively; 
one less than the mean will deviate negatively. To expe- 
dite the work of the student the correlation table should 
be divided into four quadrants, as follows: — 
  
  Tf the class-intervals have been laid off as suggested from 
left to right, and from bottom upward, the quadrants, with. 
the signs of z and y, are as just given. 
Now, to compute 32x'y’ for the whole table, going from 
compartment to compartment and summing the product 
of the pairs of measures, as shown above, will be a very la- 
borious task. The labor may be shortened very much by 
summing the a deviations of all the measures in one row, and 
multiplying Sx’ once for all by y'’. This method recognizes 
that all the measures in a given row, e.g., 2, 8, 22, 5, in row 
91-95, have the same y’, namely, + 1. Treating the material 
in this way enables us to compute the deviations mentally

and very rapidly. With this explanation we are now ready 
for step 13 in the computation of r. 
13. Compute %a’y’, by finding the sum of the deviations of the 
measures in a particular row from the mean of the x’s of the 
whole table (x). This gives 3a’. Multiply 3a’ by y’, the devia- 
tion of this particular row from ¥ the mean of the y’s of the 
whole table. This gives Sa2’y’, which is the product-sum of the 
deviations about the two assumed means.

The computation, presented here in tabular form, can be 
done mentally. In setting down the results of the S2’y’ for 
each row, as 8, 30, etc., in Table 39, it may be more accurate 
for the beginning student to tabulate both the positive and 
negative a’ separately, summing them both separately to 
give the algebraic sum of the deviations. In the accom- 
panying problem, Diagram 46, the work has all been done  
-P-A-G-E-293
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 269 
mentally, the algebraic sum of the =z’y’ being tabulated in 
one column. This gives S2’y’ = .69. 
This product-sum is for deviations computed from the 
two asswmed means, not the true means. Therefore, just 
as the means are in error by a correction ¢,, or ¢,, so each 
deviation on y and on 2 is in error by the same amount. 
Thus, since we must apply corrections to find the true means 
and the true standard deviations, so we must apply a correc- 
tion to find =zy, the product-sum of the deviations about 
the true means. This means that we must multiply c, and c, 
together to get this correction. It has been shown that the 
formula for 7, by this short method of computing the terms 
about the assumed mean, is: — 
1 7 Bie 2c,   
r= 
O20y 
* Let E, and E, represent the estimated means of the two series, and 
cz and c, be corrections to be applied to the estimated means to get the 
true means. Then the True Means, M, and M, are respectively M, = 
E.+ cand M, = E, + cy. 
Let x and y be deviations from the True Means, M, and M,. 
Let 2’ and y’ be deviations from the Estimated Means, E, and Ey. 
Thus, 2’ =a+c,and y! =y+c,. 
Therefore, Zx’y’ = X(x + cz) (y + ¢) = Lay + cyZa + cely + Testy. 
Now, since Za and Zy (the sum of the # and y deviations from the TRUE 
MEAN) each = 0, then 
Za'y’ = Zry + Dexcy, or Tey = Ta'y! — Le,cy

statement of the value of a correlation coefficient, taken 
alone, is not sufficient evidence of relationship between the

MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 271 
two traits. Having computed 7 (say, 7 = .35) we must deter- 
mine the reliability of our coefficient. This question arises: 
If we should continue to take “samples”’ from the general 
population, under the same conditions with which we took 
our original sample, would such successive “‘samples’’ con- 
tinue to give the same correlation coefficient? More con- 
cretely: Suppose we wish to find the relationship between 
ability to spell and ability to add in a very large school 
population, say, 20,000 pupils. Suppose that we have 
tested the two abilities, adequately, in a “random” sample 
of 200 pupils from this population. The correlation coefficient 
r proves to be + .35, leaving with us a belief that the two 
abilities accompany each other rather generally. We now 
ask: If we continue to take, at random, samples of 200 
pupils each from the entire 20,000 children, will 7 continue 
to be approximately .35? Or, could r fluctuate considerably 
merely from conditions of sampling? 
There are two methods of solving this problem, — the 
first the practical, but laborious method of continuing to 
take successive samples, making the group larger and larger 
until the coefficient does become stable. This common- 
sense method requires too much labor in the collection 
and treatment of data to be practically useful. 
The second or statistical method, and the one univer- 
sally used, is to turn to the question of “chance”’ and deter- 
mine the probability that such a coefficient will remain 
stable. It is clear, therefore, that the determination of re- 
liability of a correlation coefficient, like that of a mean, or 
of a standard deviation, must depend on the “normality” 
of the distributions in question. There are two distinct ques- 
tions involved: (1) Do the original data, when plotted, ap- 
proximate a normal probability distribution? (2) If so, what 
is the ratio between the size of the coefficient and the size 
of the probable error, P.E£.? 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
272 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Thus, the first step should be to plot the data, or at least 
to note whether they show fair concentration near the 
middle of the scale. It must be remembered that, with a 
small number of cases (i.e., certainly when N is less than 
30), the possibility of resemblance of the distribution to 
normality will be very doubtful. Under such cases, we do 
not know how much the probable error will be. If the dis- 
tribution can be said to resemble normality, then recourse 
may be had to the P.E. to enable us to estimate the probable 
stability of the coefficient. 
It was pointed out in Chapter VIII that the P.E. of r 
could be found from the formula — 
‘ha gp. 
PE, = 674491 VN   
Interpreted in words, this means that the chances are even 
(1 to 1) that the true value of r lies within the limits — 
1-r?* r+ P.E., or r + 67449 —— 
VN 
Thus, from the relative sizes of r and P.E. we can state 
limits outside of which it is very improbable that the true 
value will fall. For example, statistical practice has tended 
to set the criterion that the correlation coefficient should be 
at least 3 times as large as the probable error; this, largely 
on the ground that it is very improbable that the true value 
of r falls outside r+ 3 P.E. More conservative practice 
insists upon ™ being 4 times P.E. 
Thus, when N is not very small, the computation of r 
should always be supplemented by the computation of 
P.E., and r should be reported in the form: r + P.E. 
For example, in the problem of Diagram 46, .48 + .04.   
* At this point the student is referred again to the discussion of the prob- 
ability curve in Chapters VII and VIII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 278 
Table for determining P.E. It should be noted that P.E. 
is directly a measure of unreliability.. The formula shows 
that the unreliability increases as N, the number of cases, 
grows smaller. Conversely the coefficient r grows more 
reliable as N increases, but in proportion to the square of 
the number of cases. Thus, to double the reliability of a 
coefficient, we must take 4 times the number of cases. To 
triple the reliability of r, i.¢., to reduce the P.E. to one 
third of its present value, we must take 9 times the number 
of cases. This is illustrated concretely in Table X, in the 
Appendix, a table which gives at once the values of the 
P.E. for various values of r and n. Thus, if r = .3 and 
N = 25, the P.E. = .1228, nearly one half of r, which means 
doubtful reliability. The table tells us that in order to 
double the reliability, making P.E. .0614, we must take 
100 cases (4 X 25). 
In this connection an important practical question faces 
every investigator in the collection of educational data. 
How many measures must be collected in order to insure 
a coefficient which is statistically reliable? This amounts to 
asking: How can we select a random sample? The criterion 
of the probable error enables us to answer such a question 
in a rough way as follows: Assuming the worst possible con- 
dition as to correlation, 7.e., assuming 7 to be small, .1, .2, 
or .3 (unless as in rare cases, the investigator can estimate 
the coefficient and knows it to be high), determine from 
Table X the number of cases that are necessary to give P.E. 
not more than one third to one fourth of r. For example, 
if r is estimated in advance to be as low as .2, the investi- 
gator ought to take at least 100 cases to insure a sufficiently 
reliable r. The taking of a sample on such grounds satisfies 
ONLY this statistical criterion of probability. It should be 
noted, furthermore, that the value of N which is assigned 
should refer to the smallest group for which correlations are 
   
-P-A-G-E-298
    274 STATISTICAL METHODS 
to be computed. If r were .4 or more, then 25 cases would 
give sufficient reliability to the coefficient, according to 
present practice in the interpretation of correlation coef- 
ficients and probable errors. With such a small number of 
cases, however, it is clear that the criterion of the probable 
error cannot be used. When N is so small “that certain 
higher powers of its reciprocal cannot be neglected in com- 
parison with the rest of the expression involving them, the 
evalues (of the probable error) cannot be used. For such 
cases no theoretical formulz have hitherto been devised.” 1

W. Brown further cites an empirical investigation on the determination 
of, the reliability of r for small numbers of cases, 4, 8, and 30 respectively, 
“taken from a total population of 3000 pairs of measurements (height, and 
left middle-finger measurements of 3000 criminals: ‘real’ correlation,

Hence it may be concluded that, although in the case of such small samples 
as 4 or 8 the ordinary formula for the P.E. of r gives much too low a value, 
yet in the case of as many as 30, the formula applies with tolerable accur- 
acy. We must, however, bear in mind that this result has only been proved 
(empirically) to hold in the single case where the actual correlation was 
66.”

It has been common practice among educational workers 
to compute r by the use of this formula, without the neces- 
sary tabulation of the correlation table and the determina- 
tion of the linearity of regression. It has been shown in the 
foregoing pages that, in order to be able to apply the 
product-moment formula the data in question must reveal 
straight line relationship, — because r is a term in the 
equation of the straight line which “best fits” the means. of 
the table. However, when N is very small, it is question- 
able whether any method of correlation gives very reliable  
-P-A-G-E-300
  
  276 STATISTICAL METHODS 
results. For that reason it may be desirable to have avail- 
able approximate or short methods of computing correlation, 
for purposes of rough preliminary examination of the data. 
We shall take up in later sections the “rank” and fourfold 
methods of doing this. At this point we should refer to the 
use of the short method for finding correlation, applicable 
when regression is linear. 
Table 40 illustrates! the method in detail. 
II. Tur Case or Non-Linear RELATIONSHIP 
When the line of the means is not a straight line. It is 
clear that if the means of the correlation table do not accord 
fairly well with a straight line, the product-moment formula 
for r and the regression equations of the “best fitting lines” 
cannot be used to describe the relationship between the 
two traits under consideration. At the same time, we must 
note that there may be a decided relationship between two 
traits, even though the line of the means is not a straight 
line. For example, Diagram 48 presents a case of high cor- 
relation, the use of r for which leads to distinctly incorrect 
conclusions. In this diagram? the product-moment formula 
was used, giving r =— .47. The correlation is actually 
— .83, when computed by proper methods (y = — .83). 
Mere inspection of the table leads to the conclusion that it 
is not permissible to describe such a table by the equation 
of a straight line. 
It is evident, therefore, that we need a method of comput- 
ing a coefficient for those kinds of relationship in which the 
means of the table do not fall approximately on a straight 
line. Note then, that we shall seek a method of describing

relationship which, as before, will treat the separate columns 
of the table in terms of their arithmetic means. We shall be 
interested in finding how a deviation from the means of one 
trait (measured on, say, the z-axis) corresponds on the aver- 
age, to a unit deviation from the mean of the other trait, 
(measured on the other, the y-axis). 
The product-moment method involves finding the prod- 
uct of the separate ratios of pa g, that is, of the devia- 
TaN Oy 
tions of every measure of the table from the mean of its 
distribution, measured in units of the standard deviation of 
the x’s or y’s of the whole table. We find the amount that each 
measure differs from the mean of its distribution. This is 
a for the z-measures, and y for the y-measures. These x 
and y deviations can be made comparable by dividing each 
one by its respective standard deviation as a unit. Thus, 
in computing the correlation coefficient, “r,” we measure 
each deviation x or y in units of its corresponding standard 
deviation oz or cy ie, = and 2. ris the ratio between 
z y 
the sum of the x deviations times the y deviations, each 
measured in terms of its standard deviation. 
Professor Pearson has suggested that the non-linear tables 
may be treated by finding the ratio of the standard devia- 
tion of the arithmetic means of each of the columns (or 
rows) of the table to the standard deviation of the whole 
table itself (the o, for the columns and, for the rows of 
the table). In symbols this means (letting the general 
expression be called the “correlation-ratio” =)

n, = total number of measures in any column; 
Y, = the arithmetic mean of any column; 
y = the arithmetic mean of all the y’s in the table; 
N = total number of measures; 
o, = the standard deviation of all the y’s in the table. 
This is equivalent to saying 
ee | = 
the standard deviation of the means of the columns of the 
table. For, each (9, — y) equals the difference between the 
arithmetic mean of a column (%,) and the arithmetic mean 
of the total frequency obtained from all the columns in the 
table. That is, each (¥,, — 7) is the “deviation” of the mean 
of a column from the mean of all the y’s in the table. These 
are each squared and weighted by their corresponding fre- 
quencies, n,. Thus, it can be seen that the above formula is 
of the usual form of the standard deviation: — 
S fa? 
N c— 
That is, in the above symbolism, n, is equivalent to f, the 
frequency; ¥, — ¥; is equivalent to d; S is equivalent to 3.

bolism: Table 41 illustrates the method in detail.

4, Compute the arithmetic mean of the y’s in each column of the 
table. Call each of these y,. (Each of these can be left in the 
form of the correction to the true mean, or the difference be- 
tween the true and assumed means, provided ¥ is expressed 
in the same way. To do this will cut down the arithmetic 
labor somewhat.) 
5. Compute the square of the standard deviation of the y’s in 
the whole table; call this c,*. (As in step 3, use the total 
frequency distribution, headed ny.) 
6. Subtract the arithmetic mean of the whole table 7, from the 
arithmetic mean of each column, 7;, to find the amount of 
deviation of the mean of each column from the mean of the 
table. That is, perform the operation (Jz — ¥) for each col- 
umn of the table. (This corresponds to finding d in the case of 
the computation of the standard deviation of any distribu- 
tion.) 
7. Square each of these deviations (¥z — 7), giving (Ye — y)?. 
8. Weight each of the deviations (squared) by the number of 
cases occurring in each column; that is, multiply each (yz — ¥)? 
by its corresponding n,. (This corresponds to finding fd? in 
the common standard deviation formula.) 
9. Add the square of these weighted deviations. This gives 
S[nz(Yx — y)?]. (This is =fd?.) 
10. Take the square root of this quantity, and divide by N, the 
total number of cases in the whole table. This gives

computation of correlation for any kind of a table. To the 
writer’s knowledge no published analysis has been made of 
educational distributions which have utilized both the pro- 
duct-moment and the correlation-ratio methods. Thus little 
comparative data are available for us at this point. We are 
interested to know: Under what conditions can we use the 
product-moment formula? How can we determine whether 
or not a correlation table exhibits linear regression? For 
rough work, Blakeman! has stated a criterion for linearity 
which we can use to aid us with most of our distributions. 
It is that 
WR ass 67449 2   
  
must be less than 2.5. Applying this to our problem in 
Diagram 48, we get 
V148 1 = 44(.83)? — (— 47)? =6. 5. eras (.83)? — (— 47)? =6.169> 2.5   
In this case the table is obviously a non-linear table and 
the product-moment formula is inapplicable. Whenever 
the correlation table is not very linear the investigator should 
compute both 7 and r. Then the interpretation of the size 
of the coefficients 7 and r can be determined by the ap- 
plication of the criterion for linearity. 
B. METHODS WHICH TAKE ACCOUNT ONLY OF POSI- 
TION OF THE MEASURES IN THE SERIES 
I. Varrous Mrtruops or RANKS AND GRADES 
From the discussion in the foregoing chapter the two 
methods of computing correlation which take account of the 
absolute value and position of each measure in the two 
1 Blakeman, J. Biometrika, vol. 1v, pp. 349, 350.
-P-A-G-E-308
284 STATISTICAL METHODS 
series have been shown to be mathematically sound, but 
rather laborious in arithmetical work. It is clear that the 
student of educational psychology and education often has 
to content himself with comparatively few subjects, 10 to 
30 being quite a common number. With such a small num- 
ber, the unreliability of the relationships, as shown by the 
size of the P.E., often would be so great as to vitiate the 
statistical results. 
Other things being equal, that index of correlation is best 
which gives the smallest P.£. With a small number of 
cases, however, it is clear that the probable error has little 
or no significance, and that we are unable to establish the 
reliability of coefficients computed by any method. 
Spearman’s method by “‘ ranks ” or ‘‘ position.” At the 
same time we may desire a practicable formula for the cor- 
relation existing between two variables, easily computed 
and adapted to the conditions of psychological and edu- 
cational investigation. To supply this formula, Professor 
C. Spearman had empirically deduced a method of express- 
ing correlation in terms of “ranks” or “position,” rather 
than in terms of absolute quantity.! This method has been 
advanced and is coming into common usage, largely, on 
two grounds: (1) the ease of computation of the rank index; 
(2) the belief that greater comparability of measures will be 
obtained through expressing the relationships which are 
found in psychological data in measures of position. 
Spearman suggests that a distribution of psychological 
measures may not be absolutely comparable at various 
points of the distribution, whereas measures obtained in 
physical and anthropometrical research may be statistically 
treated when regarded as being absolutely comparable at all 
points of the series. On the other hand, Professor William 
1 Professor Pearson has since established mathematically the expression 
for this type of correlation by “grades.”  
-P-A-G-E-309
  
MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 285 
Brown and other psychological pupils of Pearson maintain 
that the measurement of the results of psychological ex- 
perimentation is physical measurement, and that the meas- 
ures are objectively comparable. 
Spearman has attempted to show that we may turn the 
product-moment formula 
Say r= 
No,zoy   
into the expression 
_ S@=«)? r=1 7 
= Bi aN 1) 
or 
6SD? 
25 NONB=AY’ 
where (v; — v2) or D represents any difference in the rank of 
an individual in the two series, and where 4 N(N? — 1) is 
the value that the sum of the D's would have by the operation of 
chance alone.+ 
This method is based on a very fundamental assumption, 
the validity of which is extremely. doubtful, — namely, 
that the distribution of ability is rectangular in shape. 
This means that “the wnit of rank is the same throughout 
the scale,” — that is, that individuals are separated from 
each other at the end of the scale by the same distance (or 
increment of ability) by which they are separated in the 
middle of the scale. 
Our educational testing of mental abilities leads to the 
conclusion, however, that most mental abilities distribute 
themselves in a large school population in accordance with 
a curve in which the measures are largely concentrated near 
1 See Brown, W., Essentials of Mental Measurement (1st ed., Appendix), 
for proof of this statement.
-P-A-G-E-310
286 STATISTICAL METHODS 
the central portion of the range. It has been shewn, e.g., 
in measuring abilities by various mental tests that the shape 
of the distributions for each grade and on each test takes 
a form approximating a symmetrical curve. This curve, 
with the implications of its widespread use, has been dis- 
cussed in Chapters VII and VIII. That this relates to the 
problem of “rank-correlation” should be very clear. To 
assume a rectangular distribution is to assume that each 
individual in the series is the same distance from the adja- 
cent individuals, — throughout the series. A glance at the 
bell-shaped curve shows this to be incorrect. As Pearson 
says, “Between mediocrities, the unit of rank, . . . is prac- 
tically zero; between extreme individuals it is very large 
indeed. Since we must assume a theoretical form of dis- 
tribution, the form in this case (referring to Spearman’s 
rank-method of computing correlation) must be a rec- | 
tangle, which is a most improbable one.” 
Pearson’s method by ‘‘ grades.” It has been shown that 
the best assumption we can make concerning the distribu- 
tion of ability is that it is somewhat “bell-shaped,” that is, 
resembles the normal curve. It happens, therefore, that 
Pearson has given us a method of computing correlation in 
which we can use the “grades”’ (which amount, practically, 
to “ranks” in actual computation) of each of the measures 
in the series. There are two points we should clear up, how- 
ever. (1) The “grade” of a particular individual in a series is 
measured by the number of individuals above him in the 
series. (The “rank” indicates the position only.) (2) The 
theoretical distribution of the measures by which the method 
is worked out is assumed to be that of the “normal” or 
“probability” curve. This accords more closely with the 
actual distribution of abilities than Spearman’s assumption. 
It is possible, therefore, to assume a normal distribution 
and deduce an expression for 7 (not Spearman’s p or R)

measured in terms of the “grade” of an individual in the 
series. 
The expression for the correlation by grades may now be 
set down as: —

the following expression when the grades are measured in 
terms of the sum of the positive differences between the grades 
in the two series. 
The formula for r now becomes

We thus have two complete formule for 7, when com- 
puted for “grades,” which are sound mathematically and 
may be applied, providing the distributions of the traits 
which are being correlated are approximately “normal.” 
These are formule (A) and (E) above. 
It is clear that the computation by either one may be 
shortened a great deal by reducing the work as far as pos- 
sible to the use of tables. It is evident that this can be done 
for the transmutation of p and R into r. Tables VII and 
VIII (see Appendix) are given herewith for that purpose. 
Having computed p by formula (B), the student can read 
from Table VII the value of r corresponding to the com- 
puted value of p. Similarly, for any value of R, the corre- 
sponding value of r can be read from Table VIII. 
Steps in the computation of r by ‘‘ rank” methods. Re- 
ferring to the illustrative problem in Table 42, let us list 
the steps in the computation of r by these so-called rank- 
methods. 
1. Rank the measures in order of size, beginning with the smallest 
or largest. 
2. Subtract the rank of each measure in the first series from its 
corresponding rank in the second series. Call this D, the dif- 
ference in rank. Tabulate these as positive, negative, or 0. 
8. If formula (B) is used, square each of these differences, giv- 
ing the column headed D?. If Formula (F) is used, treat only 
the positive differences, the g’s of formula (F). 
4. Sum the D”’s (or the g’s) giving =D? or Sg.
-P-A-G-E-313
MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 289 
5. Multiply =D? or Sg by 6. 
6. For formula (B) divide 62D? by N(N?— 1). N = total 
number of measures. In the same way for formula (F), divide 
62g by N?— 1. 
‘7. Subtract the quotient in either case from 1. This is p for the 
first method, R for the second. 
8. Transmute p into r by reading proper value from Table VII. 
-Transmute R into r by reading proper value from Table VIII. 
In the illustrative problem it is noted that r= .732 by 
formula (F), and .717 by formula (B). The conclusion drawn 
from either one would be the same. In general it may be 
said that the two formule give fairly comparable results, 
and that from the standpoint of ease of computation the 
“Footrule” formula 
629 
~Nt=1   
R=1 
may well be the one chosen for use. For small values of N, 
the only cases after all in which the rank methods are to 
be used, they lead to as sound conclusions as any of the 
more accurate methods, the product-moment or correlation- 
ratio. 
Discussion of rank methods of computing correlation. 
The first and principal criticism of Spearman’s rank method 
has been indicated above, namely, that it assumes a rec- 
tangular distribution and an equal unit of rank throughout 
the scale. These assumptions are inadmissible. 
Second, Pearson has shown that when the number of cases 
is small, Spearman’s R retains the same value for very wide 
variations in p. 
Third, he has shown that the probable error of a zero 
correlation obtained by Spearman’s R is considerably larger 
than that obtained by his r, — hence that “rank” correla- 
tions are less accurate than “product-moment” correlations. 
He says, “In particular it requires about 30 % more obser-

vations by the R method to obtain r with the same degree 
of certainty when r is 0.” 
Fourth, Spearman’s transmutation formula 
Sine R r= ins ) 
was obtained empirically from 111 correlations with only 
21 cases (N = 21). Brown suggests that the chance that 
the formula thus selected empirically with but 21 cases was 
the best one, could not have been great. Many like formulas 
would have fitted equally well. We should use that formula 
which has a sound mathematical basis. 
In general we may say, that with 30-100 cases or more, that 
where accuracy is desired in relationships the product- 
moment method should be used. It gives definite averages 
(means) and measures of variability, and when tabulated 
in table form gives a definite perspective of the distribution 
of measures themselves. In the interpretation of the co- 
efficient it is of great value, — in fact is positively necessary . 
to the adequate interpretation of r. Furthermore, by the use 
of the correlation table the correlation ratio, 7 can be com- 
puted, which is a necessary step in determining the line- 
arity of regression. Again, ranking the measures introduces 
a “spurious homogeneity”? which may effect the accuracy 
of our later interpretation and conclusions. 
We can thus lay down a rule: USE THE RANK 
METHOD ONLY WHEN N is small (say, less than 30). 
In such cases the means and the standard deviations are 
of little value, owing to the size of the P.E.’s. The result 
in cases of this sort can at best only indicate the EXIS- 
TENCE of correlation and Not the Closeness of the Rela- 
tionship. Therefore we must be extremely cautious in our 
interpretation of rank correlations, or of any correlations 
computed for a small number of cases.

Rough approximation methods. The methods discussed in 
the foregoing sections have been of two types: (1) refined 
methods which take full account of the absolute value and 
position of each pair of measures; (2) those which take ac- 
count only of the rank or position of each pair of measures. 
There is available to the student, however, a group of rough 
methods even more approximate in character than the 
methods of “ranks.” These methods take account of posi- 
tion of the measures very roughly by classifying the meas- 
ures with reference to some average point in the two series. 
We list these methods next, in this outline, prior to discuss- 
ing them.

The methods already discussed in the book have dealt 
with the statistics of variables, — with problems involving 
measured quantities of the continuously varying type. It 
was pointed out in Chapter IV that the student would meet 
types of problems in which the presence or absence of cer- 
tain traits would be noted (counted) and in which the cor- 
relation methods adapied to statistics of variables would 
not be applicable. These problems were pointed out under 
the name “statistics of attributes.” Various attempts ! 
have been made to devise coefficients which would measure 
relationships in these types of problems. Most successful 
of all has been Pearson’s coefficient of mean-square-con- 
tingency with which we shall close the discussion of relation- 
ship. Thus, to complete the outline: —

1. Pearson’s cos = method 
The correlation between the two series of (17) measures 
in Table 42 was computed by taking account of the relative 
position, or rank, of each measure in the two series. In this 
work there was no attempt to measure relative changes in 
value of the measures, except as these were gross enough to 
change relative ranks. It is evident that a still shorter 
1 Yule has devised a “coefficient of association,” Q, for fourfold tables. 
(See Yule, G. U., An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, chaps. 1, 111, 
Iv; v.) 
Pearson, K., and Heron, D. (Biometrika, vol. 9, pp. 159-315) have shown 
that this coéfficient is unstable and rarely leads to sound measures of rela- 
tionship. Its use is not recommended to the student.  
-P-A-G-E-319
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 295 
method of computing the extent of relationship could be de- 
vised by finding an average of each series of ranks, and com- 
paring the position of each pair of measures with respect to 
being above or below that average in each series. To do this 
results in turning the ranking of the two series of measures 
into a “fourfold table.” Tables 43 and 44, and Diagram 50 
illustrate this fact.

  It is clear that such a method of finding correlation takes 
inadequate account of either position or value of the meas- 
ures in those cases in which the form of the two distribu- 
tions is not closely the same. For those cases in which the 
measures are distributed over the scale in approximately the 
same way, this rough method will supply an adequate 
measure of correlation, provided a single index can properly 
be devised for the amount of relationship. Pearson’s 
formula is 
rT = cos We * 
Vad + be 
Applying this formula to the problem in Table 43, we have

* = 180°; the student should have a table of natural trigonometric 
functions, from which to read the value of r for various values of the angle. 
This is supplied in the Appendix.

MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 297 
It will be remembered that r by the rank methods gave 
-717, and .732 by the product-moment method. In general, 
such approximate methods should be used for only rough 
preliminary examination. 
2. Sheppard’s method of unlike signs 
Sheppard has suggested an approximate’ formula for 
roughly measuring relationship in fourfold classification in 
terms of the percentage of cases that are of like or unlike 
“signs” in the two series of measures. 
To get this expression, substitute in Pearson’s formula 
be 
Vad + be 
for the square root of the product of the be cases, the percent= 
age of cases having unlike signs (call this U); and for the 
square root of the ad cases, the percentage of cases having 
like signs in the two series (call it Z). This gives at once 
Sheppard’s formula Tr = cos 
= cos bee L+U   
(N) r 
Now, L +U always is 100, and z is 180°. Hence we may 
reduce the formula to r = cos U 1.8°. 
Whipple ! points out that U must lie between 50 and 0 
for positive, and 50 and 100 for inverse correlations, and that 
therefore it becomes possible to prepare a table from which 
values of r for any integer of U may be read directly. 
This table is given herewith as Table IX, Appendix.

1 American Journal of Psychology, vol. xvut, pp. 322-25.
-P-A-G-E-322
298 STATISTICAL METHODS 
    On account of the very large P.E. involved in its use, 
the method of unlike signs must not be used in important 
correlation work unless the correlations are high (exceeding 
.50); the classes are very fine, and the number of cases 
fairly large. Its real function is one of preliminary investiga- 
tion only. On the other hand, since it involves arranging, in 
order of size, all the measures in the series, the device is 
hardly serviceable with large numbers of cases (say 70 to 
100 and upwards). For series of 30-50 measures, it might well 
be used as a method of preliminary investigation of relation- 
ship. 
To illustrate the employment of these methods, Whipple 
cites an example in which the correlation is desired between 
the accuracy with which 50 boys can cancel ¢e from a printed 
slip, and the accuracy with which the same 50 boys can can- 
cel q, r, s, and ¢ from a similar slip. The results of each test 
are first arranged in order, the least accurate boy first and 
the most accurate last. We can either determine the average, 
in which case all the boys that rank below the average are 
minus and all that rank above the average are plus, or we 
can take the median value and consider the first 25 boys 
in each array as minus and the second 25 as plus cases. 
The following values were obtained: — 
a=18;b=11; c=8; d=18. Hence U = 38. By the use of 
either short formula, r = .87 with a P.E. of .26. By using Pear- 
son’s product-moment method we obtain, for the same arrays, 
r = AT with P.E. of .06. By actual timing, after the distribution 
had been made, the first method occupied eight minutes and the 
second two hours and fifteen minutes, even with the adding 
machine and the tables previously mentioned. 
On the other hand, it will be noticed that in the above 
problem the correlation of .87 with P.E. of .26 has abso- 
lutely no significance at all, whereas the product-moment 
value of .47 with P.£. of .06 is satisfactory. Furthermore,
-P-A-G-E-323
MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 299 
it should be pointed out that practice in the tabulation of 
double-entry tables and computation of r by the short 
method will cut down the time of computation very mark- 
edly. Thirty to forty-five minutes should be ample for the 
computation of r in the above problem.

1. Pearson’s coefficient of mean square contingency (C) 
In the foregoing sections methods have been described 
for treating two kinds of data. The first type was data which 
have been collected in the refined measurement of human 
traits (known as Statistics of Variables). Both refined and 
approximate methods of treating such measures have been 
discussed; i.e., detailed regression methods, and approximate 
rank and fourfold methods. The second type of data is that 
in which we merely count the presence or absence of traits 
(as when pupils in school pass or fail, are tall or short, are 
normal or feeble-minded) or in which at the most we classify 
the data in several groups, without specific quantitative 
measurement (such as is illustrated by the tables showing 
relationship between mental age and pedagogical age, in 
Chapter IV). These kinds of statistics have been called the 
Statistics of Attributes. It is clear that the methods designed 
to describe relationship between measured quantities are not 
applicable to the statistics of non-measured traits. 
The coarsest method of measuring relationship between 
such traits is to classify them in a fourfold table, and to 
treat them by Pearson’s or Sheppard’s fourfold methods. 
The weaknesses of these methods already have been pointed 
out. We need methods which will take cognizance of the 
classification of measures into several classes and which 
will be mathematically consistent (as we increase the fine-

lationship between variables. 
Pearson’s coefficient. Such a method is supplied by Pear- 
son’s coefficient of mean-square contingency — 
  
x? 
C= +x   
It is built up by reference to the theory of probability, 
and measures relationship in terms of the difference between 
the numbers of measures actually found in the various com- 
partments of the cor- 
relation table (or

in any compartment (say the one determined by the row 
marked n, and the column marked n,) by pure chance.
-P-A-G-E-325
  MEASURE MENT OF RELATIONSHIP 301 
This can be stated by first stating the probability that any 
one measure will fall in that particular compartment. 
Now, the probability that a particular measure will fall 
e and the probability that 
a particular measure will fall anywhere in the column marked anywhere in the row marked n, is 
  Nz is 4 Hence the probability that any one measure will fall 
in both this row and this compartment will be or (the 
probability of a compound event happening is the prod- 
uct of the probabilities of the separate events.) But we 
wish the NUMBER of measures that ought to fall in this 
particular compartment. Since there are N measures in the 
table, this must be N times the probability that any one 
will fall there. Thus the number that might be expected 
to fall there by pure chance is 
NN 
N_ 
Since n,, represents the number that actually fell in that 
compartment, the difference between the two is 
NyNe 
N 
Pearson suggests that a coefficient can be built which will 
measure relationship by finding the ratios of the differences 
between the number that actually fall in any compartment 
and the number that might be expected to fall there by pure 
chance to the number that might be expected to fall there by 
pure chance. That is by summing the ratios —

-P-A-G-E-326
  302 STATISTICAL METHODS 
We cannot simply add the differences together, for the 
sum of the values of A must be zero (some A’s are negative, 
and some are positive), and so we square each of the dif- 
ferences and sum them. If, then, we compute A for each 
compartment, square it, and compute the ratio of each A? 
to the corresponding value which is to be expected by pure 
chance, we can write Pearson’s expression for “‘square-con- 
tingency” which will be represented by x?, thus: —

In terms of ¢? his coefficient of mean-square-contingency is, 
since 
  It is evident that C is 0 if the two traits are not correlated, 
and that it approaches more nearly towards unity as yx? 
increases. C is always positive, and no sign should be at- 
tached except for conventional purposes. 
Yule shows ! that such coefficients, when “calculated on

different systems of classification, are not comparable with 
each other. It is clearly desirable, for practical purposes, that 
two coefficients calculated from the same data, classified 
in two different ways, should be, at least approximately, 
identical. With the present coefficient this is not the case: 
if certain data be classified in, say, (1) 6 X 6-fold, (2) 3X 3- 
fold form, the coefficient in the latter form tends to be the 
least. The greatest possible value is, in fact, only unity if 
the number of classes be infinitely great; for any finitenumber 
of classes the limiting value of C is the smaller the smaller 
the number of classes.” 
Yule then shows that Pearson’s coefficient of mean-square- 
contingency may be replaced by another which is easier of 
computation, thus: —

    304 STATISTICAL METHODS 
This expresses C in terms much easier of computation, and 
formulas (7) and (8) should be used by the student in com- 
puting the relationship between two traits by “contingency.” 
Yule next shows that if we deal with a ¢ X ¢-fold classi- 
fication of data in which the relationship is perfect, “all 
the frequency is then concentrated in the diagonal com- 
partments of the table, and each contributes N to the sum 
S. The total value of S is accordingly ¢ N and the value of 
1    C= (9) 
t 
This is the greatest possible value of C for a symmetrical 
t X t-fold classification, and therefore, in such a table, for 
t=2 Ccannotexceed 0.707

z=10 5 rg 0.949 
It is well, therefore, to restrict the use of the ‘coefficient 
of contingency’ to 5 X 5-fold or finer classifications. At the 
same time the classification must not be made too fine, or 
else the value of the coefficient is largely affected by casual 
irregularities of no physical significance in the class-fre- 
quencies.” 
Steps in the computation of the coefficient. Taking for- 
mula (8)

we next make clear the steps in the computation of the 
coefficient. The arithmetic work reduces to four main
-P-A-G-E-329
  MEASUREMENT OF RELATIONSHIP 805 
steps: (1) finding S; (2) subtracting N from S; (3) divid- 
  
ing S—N by S; (4) extracting the square root of 3 
The detailed procedure is as follows: — 
A. Find 
ie (ES) 
NyMe 
N 
This involves four steps: 
(1) Square the number found in each compartment of the 
table: (nrc)? [e.g., 4, 49, 9, 1, 1, for the first row of 
Table 45.] 
(2) For each compartment in the table multiply the total 
number in its column by the total number in its row, 
(n,-n-) and divide each product by (N), the total num- 
ber in the table. 
For example, for the illustrative problem for the 
compartments in the lowest row: — 
14 21x14 2x4 s %   
  
  07 ae 3.59 
13 X 14 16 X 14 sone 2.22 SJaei ce 2.73 
16 x 14 = 2.73 82 f 
It will probably save time and reduce errors of 
computation to tabulate these results separately as 
given by Table 46 below. 
(8) For each compartment divide the result of doing (1) by 
the result of doing (2). 
For example, for the top row, — 
MG 4 2.83 at 
49 148 ~ 33.11

-P-A-G-E-330
  306 STATISTICAL METHODS 
(4) Sum each of the results obtained by doing (3). This 
gives S. 
B. Subtract (N), the total frequency of the table, from S, giving 
S-N. 
C. Divide S — N by S. 
S—N 4 D. Extract square root of Ba . This gives C, the coeffi- & y

  CHAPTER X 
USE OF TABULAR AND GRAPHIC METHODS IN 
REPORTING SCHOOL FACTS 
Studying vs. reporting facts. Each chapter of this book 
has pointed out specific uses of graphic and statistical meth- 
ods in school practice. Chapter I, especially, gave atten- 
tion to the use of such methods in the current attempts to 
solve school problems, by giving typical examples. The use 
of statistical and graphic methods was shown: in the con- 
struction and use of standardized tests; in the preparation 
of forms for recording school statistics; in the supervision 
of the teaching of school studies; in the detection of weak- 
nesses in the course of study, and in teaching methods by 
means of studies in failures; in the comparative method of 
studying school costs, as shown by Bobbitt’s and by Upde- 
graff’s early devices; in the use of the probability curve in 
marking pupils and in standardizing school tests; in the dis- 
tribution of intelligence in the public schools; and in the 
use of correlation methods. Throughout the book, the ap- 
plications have been illustrative of the more refined statis- 
tical and graphic methods that can be used in the carrying 
on of school research, and in the reporting of results to 
readers technically trained in statistical methods. 
The school man, however, having made use of various 
fairly refined methods in studying his problems, faces the 
problem of reporting the status of his schools to a public 
that is, in part, neither trained in the rudiments of statis- 
tical method nor familiar with the general conditions of 
public school administration to-day.
-P-A-G-E-335
USE OF TABULAR AND GRAPHIC METHODS 311 
It has been decided, therefore, to conclude the discussion 
in this book by presenting, in outline form, a representative 
selection of examples of the application of various tabular 
and graphic methods of reporting school facts. There is 
available in print no systematic statement of such methods, 
brought up to date. Now that school men are beginning to 
study problems of school administration scientifically, — 
now that they really are beginning to build up a quantitative 
knowledge about school conditions, — they are recognizing 
at last the definite need of ways and means of reporting the 
facts to the public. School men face no greater problem 
to-day than that of determining best ways to tell the non- 
teaching public about the status of schools, and to make 
clear to them the necessity for doing something about it 
which will conduce to the definite advancement of school 
practice. 
In reporting school facts to the public we must therefore 
distinguish the interests and technical equipment of the 
persons to whom we are reporting our facts. That is, we 
must recognize that the methods that we should use in re- 
porting experimental and statistical studies to a technically 
trained group of school people must necessarily differ from 
the methods with which we should report facts concerning 
school practice to the general lay citizenship. 
The most immediate technical agency (aside from news- 
papers) for acquainting the public with school conditions 
is the annual school report. The remainder of this chapter 
will, therefore, be devoted to a discussion of the form and 
content of the annual city school report. 
School reports are planned and printed to reach three 
classes of people. These three classes are: (1) administra- 
tive officers, teachers, and other school employees, who 
should be informed of the conduct of school affairs through- 
out the entire system for the year just finished; (2) pro-

fessional school officers (interested in either the educational 
or business aspects of school administration) in other school 
systems, bureaus, foundations, and professional schools, who 
are active in studying comparatively the various problems of 
school administration; and (3) the board of education itself 
and the more intelligent lay public, whose general insight 
and educational interest can be depended on to support 
campaigns for the betterment of the public schools. 
Kinds of material that should be included. This clearly 
must be determined by the aim in mind in attempting to 
reach the various classes of people to whom the report is to 
go. It undoubtedly will be agreed that a school report should 
supply: (1) those facts that can be interpreted and used so 
as to improve school practice directly, by contributing to 
the betterment of instruction; (2) those facts that can be 
interpreted and used so as to improve school practice in- 
directly, by contributing to the improvement of the work 
of a non-educational department (buildings or supplies, for 
example); (3) those facts that will be comprehended by and 
will stimulate an interest on the part of the general public 
in the community, and will result in the support of better 
schools; (4) those facts which will acquaint the public, in 
accordance with law, with the condition of school property 
and of school finance in the city. : 
It can be seen, therefore, that the criteria of interpreta- 
bility and of use should largely govern the content of a school 
report. The questions to be asked in making up the report 
should be: Can this statistical table be interpreted so as 
to improve some phase of school practice? Does it provide 
comparative material of which other school systems or 
students of school administration can make use? Can these 
data be understood by the public, and has the interpretation 
and explanation been made so complete and clear that this 
report will operate as a means of “educating” — as well 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
USE OF TABULAR AND GRAPHIC METHODS 313 
as informing — the public to active support of the public 
schools? 
Again it undoubtedly will be agreed that a school report 
should contain material of three distinct types: (1) Current 
material : It should report the local situation in sufficient 
detail to explain the significant developments of the cur- 
rent year and the present condition of the public schools. 
(2) Historical material : It should present enough historical 
statistics concerning the growth of important phases of the 
schools’ work to permit a discussion of particular aspects 
and of relative efficiency of the activity of certain depart- 
ments. (3) Comparative material: It should contain com- 
parative data of the procedure of other school systems 
working under similar conditions. Lacking an absolute 
standard for judging the efficiency of school practice, the 
common practice of many cities may well serve as a check 
upon the methods employed in any one. 
Statistical material must be interpreted by descriptive 
material. To include pages of statistical material with no 
interpretations or comparisons is, for the layman at least, a 
waste of printer’s ink. All tabular and graphic data should 
be interpreted clearly, either by the officer who publishes 
the material, by the superintendent of the schools, or by. 
some other officer especially appointed in the system to 
study ways and means of improving the conduct of school 
business, — for example, the director of the “bureau of 
school research and efficiency.”’ Thus, school reports which 
have been very largely “statistical” and “informational” 
should become “educational” in the widest community 
sense. The school report in a city system can be made a 
valuable instrument for the promotion of school work in 
the city. To become that, however, it at least must conform 
to the foregoing fundamental criteria. i 
Important criteria concerning the form of the school
-P-A-G-E-338
  314 STATISTICAL METHODS 
report. We may discuss briefly the more important questions 
arising in connection with the form of the annual school 
report. The first question to be settled is this: Shall the 
school report be one volume appearing annually, biennially, 
or less frequently, or shall it be published in the form of 
a series of short. monographs, each of which discusses one 
phase of school work? The traditional school report is a com- 
posite volume made up of general descriptive articles by edu- 
cational officers of the system, put together in one portion 
of the report, and followed by a large mass of statistical 
data, as a rule completely uninterpreted and, on the whole, 
uninterpretable by the general public. Such a volume, in- 
quiry has shown, is almost never read by any portion of the 
public. 
A great advance has been marked out by the recent inno- 
vation begun by Superintendent F. E. Spaulding, while he 
was Superintendent of Schools at Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
in the publication of a series of monographs describing in 
clear language, and pertinently illustrated by graphic and 
comparative statistical methods, the status of educational 
activities of the city of Minneapolis. In the quotations of 
this chapter, we shall make several references to this ex- 
cellent practice. 
We cannot decide the question of the general form of 
the school report, however, without taking account of the 
question of the frequency with which school facts need to 
be reported. Should all data regarding school practice be 
reported annually, or are there types of facts which may well 
be published but intermittently? 
Classes of school facts. We can distinguish school facts, 
therefore, in two classes: — 
First, those that are reported annually. These may be 
summarized as follows: (1) facts that either state or munici- 
pal law requires must be published each year, concerning the
-P-A-G-E-339
  USE OF TABULAR AND GRAPHIC METHODS 315 
extent and condition of school property; (2) current and his- 
torical local statistics concerning the financial condition of 
the board of education, the distribution of pupils according 
to ages and grades, the enumeration of children of school- 
census age in the city, and the detailed reporting of statistics 
on the teaching staff; (3) facts concerning the progress of 
educational experiments or innovations that have been es- 
tablished prior to the current year, and in which the public 
will have a definite interest: for example, new methods of 
detecting defects in children, and of providing for them; 
special forms of instruction; new developments in voca- 
tional education; ete.; (4) information concerning the es- 
tablishment of new educational experiments, — important 
and far-reaching changes in the administration of the local 
schools, etc. 
Second, school facts that are reported intermittently. It 
frequently occurs that it is necessary for the superintend- 
ent and the board of education to give the public detailed 
and specific information concerning needed enlargements, 
greater financial support of the schools, ete. For example, 
our larger cities are all feeling the need for increased revenues 
for permanent improvements to the school plant. School 
populations are increasing, and the consequent demands on 
our public school facilities are likewise increasing, usually 
more rapidly than are the revenues made possible under 
state law by the increase in real wealth in the community, 
City school boards are finding it imperative, therefore, to go 
to the people for authority to bond the school district in 
order to finance the additional school plant which is needed. 
This necessitates an educational campaign, and this in 
turn demands a special kind of school report. This report 
may well give facts to the public that ordinarily will not 
need to be given each year. For example, a detailed compara- 
tive analysis of the status of school finance in this particular
-P-A-G-E-340
  316 STATISTICAL METHODS 
city with that in other comparable cities, together with an 
analytical study of the historical development of various 
aspects of school finance may well be needed. We shall 
point out, later on, illustrative methods of reporting such 
studies. 
School facts that should not be printed at all. Careful 
examination of current city school reports reveals the pub- 
lication of many types of statistical and descriptive material 
that ought not to be printed at all. This can be illustrated 
partially by listing specific types of non-usable statistics 
published in the annual report of one of our largest and most 
progressive school systems: (1) tables of total values of sup- 
plies delivered to various types of schools (of little value 
unless reduced to some unit basis, and presented histori- 
cally); (2) analyzed statement of total cost of transporta- 
tion by schools for current year; (3) a table, twelve pages 
long, giving itemized amounts of each particular kind of 
supplies delivered to each building in the system; (4) list of 
textbooks lost or destroyed in district schools, giving names 
of the books, number, and price of each; (5) number and 
money value of condemned books, together with rebound 
books, by specific title, number, price, etc.; (6) list of text- 
books, giving name of book, number in usable condition in 
all public schools, price, value, etc. (16 pages); (7) names of 
pupils graduating from various schools; (8) names and facts 
concerning all teachers and other officers on the staff; (9) 
detailed statement of total expenditures for particular activ- 
ities for each building in the system (as “totals” the table 
is uninterpretable; it might be condensed to small fraction 
of present size, 44 pages; it ought to be reduced to a per- 
pupil basis); (10) detailed statements concerning cost of 
particular activities and special schools, giving totals and 
itemized expenditures, etc., — might well be condensed and 
published as “unit” costs.

The foregoing introductory discussion can now more im- 
mediately be focused upon the specific organization of the 
content of the school report. As we proceed with the dis- 
cussion, in each case we shall point out whether the material 
should be annually reported or reported at intervals of 
several years. 
1 | Legal basis of the local school system 
Form of organization. The introductory statements 
should contain a table of contents, with a pertinent list of 
subheadings, to make clear to the reader the important 
points discussed in the report. This should be followed by a 
brief text statement describing the legal basis of the system. 
The reader should be told the important facts concerning the 
origin, development, and present legal status of the city 
school district, exactly how its functions are affected by 
those of city civil district, and what i 
come about in this legal status. A clear statement should be 
given concerning the present board of education — its size, 
how members are selected, the specific powers and duties 
of the board, the committee organization, tenure, compensa- 
tion of board members, etc. 
Legal basis of school finance. This should be pointed out 
very clearly, answering such questions as: Does the board 
of education have complete tax-levying power? If not, by 
what agency are its budgets reviewed? What are the legal 
limits of school revenue? Are permanent improvements and 
current school expenses financed out of taxation? What is 
the legal status of bonding the school district for school 
purposes, and of borrowing for temporary purposes on short- 
term notes? 
     
-P-A-G-E-342
  318 STATISTICAL METHODS 
The detail into which the annual discussion of the legal 
basis of school finance should go must be determined by the 
financial condition and by the current financial powers of the 
board. A brief statement of the latter is all that is required 
in an annual report in which special efforts are not being 
made to effect a change in taxing powers, taxing limits, ete. 
In case it becomes necessary to make a special plea to the 
people, the report should go into the legal status carefully. 
If the critical change needed is to give the board of education 
complete taxing power, and the board wishes to show the 
effects of having its budgets reviewed by another govern- 
mental body, a table such as Table 47 and a diagram 
such as Diagram 52 might be used, with proper textual 
explanations.

2. Presentation of facts concerning school revenues and

The superintendent of schools annually will wish to make 
clear to his community the following facts concerning 
school finance: —

sources; (5) from miscellaneous sources; (6) total income 
for annual maintenance; (7) from sale of bonds; and (8) total 
receipts. It might be well to add another short table giving 
percentages that each source contributed to the total re- 
ceipts. Each of these items should be shown for a series 
of years, at least.ten, so as to admit of comparisons being 
easily made. 
(c) Relation of revenue receipts to current expenditures. 
Each year it would be well to publish a table giving the 
facts for a series of years relating to receipts and expenditures, 
both for current maintenance and for permanent improve- 
ments, and showing the financial condition of the board of 
education by comparing the receipts with expenditures 
for each and showing the surplus or deficit each year for a 
number of years.

of real wealth in the city, and, third, per pupil in aver- 
age daily attendance. This further calls up the question 
of comparing expenditures in the local city with those 
in a group of comparable cities. How often should such 
a comparative analysis be made? It is probable that lack 
of clerical assistance will prevent the compilation each year 
of original data, and the computation of unit costs with 
consequent “ranking” of cities. It certainly should be done 
every few years. If it can be done, Tables 52 and 531 and 
Diagram 56? suggest the type of comparison that can be 
made to establish the point at hand.

Other graphic methods. The four diagrams which follow 
show means which may be used by superintendents to reveal 
facts to their constituencies, using graphic instead of 
tabular methods of presentation. A little thought given to 
devising such graphic representations at the time of pre- 
paring the annual report will be time well spent.

(g) How the board of education spends its money. The 
publication of current total and per capita expenditures are 
of little value, unless they are accompanied by historical and 
comparative statistics. The school report should give: — 
First. The total amounts spent, and the amounts spent 
per pupil in average daily attendance, for (1) all current 
expenses, and (2) permanent improvements. This can be 
pictured clearly by a chart after the form of Diagram 53. 
Second. The total and per pupil (in average daily attend- 
ance) ? expenditures for all educational purposes, as con- 
trasted with all business purposes and the per cent devoted 
to each. Ranks of the cities should be given for each table. 
A five-year table giving the relative expenditures in the local 
city might well be included. 
Third. The degree to which the board supports different 
kinds of educational service: (1) for the larger aspects, such 
as administration, supervision and instruction, operation of 
plant and maintenance of plant; and (2) for specific kinds of 
service, such as board of education office, superintendent’s 
office, salaries of supervisors and their clerks, salaries of 
principals and their clerks, salaries of teachers, stationery 
and educational supplies, wages of janitors, fuel, water, 
light and power, and repairs. For each of these items the 
reporting should be done in terms of (1) total amount spent; 
(2) amount spent per pupil; (3) per cent of total expendi- 
tures devoted to each; and (4) rank of all cities in the list, 
for the expenditures for each item, in order to compare the 
local city with other cities of its class.*

Fourth. Total expenditures and expenditures per pupil 
for capital outlay. Because of the fluctuations from year 
to year in expenditures for permanent improvements, such 
ought to be reported both for the current year, and for an 
average of four or five years. If clerical assistance makes it 
possible, this should also be compared with the other cities 
in the list. It involves very laborious computations, if done 
for many years. 
Fifth. The degree to which the board supports different 
kinds of schools, — elementary and secondary. Table 54

4. The reporting of facts concerning the pupil 
Data needed, and forms. There are eight types of fact that 
the annual school report should give the public and school 
officers about the pupil: (1) the number of children of school 
census age in the city; (2) the total enrollment in all schools 
in the city; (3) the total enrollment in public schools; (4) as 
closely as possible, the estimated enrollment in parochial 
schools; (5) the total and the average enrollment and aver- 
age daily attendance in each of the various grades, kinder- 
garten to last grade in high school inclusive; (6) the distribu- 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-363
  USE OF TABULAR AND GRAPHIC METHODS _ 339 
tion of children in each grade according to age; (7) the dis- 
tribution of children in each grade according to number of 
years spent in the grade; (8) distribution of children in 
each grade according to the facts concerning “promotion.” 
Tables 62 to 67 suggest tabular arrangements of these data.! 
Picturing the holding power of the schools. It will be 
desirable to use graphic devices to picture the efficiency 
with which the school machinery holds pupils in school, 
grades and classifies them, and promotes them through the 
various grades. Diagram 60 represents a good method of 
presenting to the people the degree to which the public 
schools are educating the children of school age in the city. 
Diagram 61 is an excellent pictorial device, taken from the 
1914-15 St. Louis School Report, for showing the increase in 
persistence of children in school. Such a diagram is clear and 
is easily comprehended by citizens. Diagram 62 ? suggests a 
method of illustrating the “holding power” of the schools. 
Diagrams 5, 6, and 7, in Chapter I, give graphic methods of 
studying and reporting failures in the schools, by grades and 
by subjects. 
5. Reporting facts as to the school plant 
School buildings. The following topical list of points 
should be covered in reporting facts as to the school build- 
ings in use: — 
1. Number of buildings, — elementary, intermediate, sec- 
ondary, covering a period of years. 
2. Number of classrooms in use at stated time, covering 
comparison of several years. 
8. Valuation of school property; historical, several years.

4. Cost of new buildings. A tabular form for such data 
is suggested by Table 68. 
5. Standards used in judging buildings. For such facts 
a graphic form is shown in Diagrams 69 and 70. 
Standards may be set, as shown in Diagram 70, against 
the individual buildings of the system to permit of a judg-

The primary aim has been to illustrate, in compact form, 
suggestive tabular and graphic means for setting forth ef- 
fectively such information.t At the same time the actual

* A very complete compilation of Graphic Methods for Presenting Facts 
has been published by W. C. Brinton in a book by that name. (Engineering 
Magazine Company, New York, 1914.) The preparer of graphic reports, 
in whatever subjects, will receive very great aid from consulting this book.

Ordinates of the normal probability curve expressed as fractional parts 
of the mean ordinate y,. Each ordinate is erected at a given distance from 
the mean. The height of the ordinate erected at the mean can be com- 
puted from, N N Yo = —- —— oV2r 2.5066 0 The corresponding height of any other ordinate can be read from the table 
by assigning the distance that the ordinate is from the mean (x). Distances 
on «# are measured as fractional parts of ¢. Thus the height of an ordinate 
at a distance from the mean of .70 will be .78270 y, ; the height of an or- 
dinate at 2.15 ¢ from the mean will be .09914 y,, ete.

Percentile scores to be assigned to test problems or questions which 
correspond to various percentages of pupils who fail to solve problems or 
questions: correctly. Table is based upon area of normal probability curve, 
assuming base line to be broken off at +2.50. Scholastic abilities are as- 
sumed to fit the probability curve and percentages of pupils who solve 
various problems correspond to percentages of area under the curve from 
the 0 point to a point on the base line. This point on base line, measured 
in units of ¢, is transformed into percentile scores by setting 0 at —2.50, 
50 at the mean, and 100 at +2.5c. 
Example: A problem failed by 22 per cent of a large number of pupils 
is scored 35; one failed by 98.35 per cent is scored 90; ete.

Percentile scores to be assigned to test problems or questions which 
correspond to various percentages of pupils who fail to solve problems 
or questions correctly. Table is based upon area of probability curve, as- 
suming base line to be broken off at + 3.0¢. Scholastic abilities are assumed 
to fit the probability curve and percentages of pupils who solve various 
problems correspond to percentages of area under the curve from the 0 
point to a point on the base line. This poirit on base line, measured in 
units of ¢, is transformed into percentile scores by setting 0 at -3.0 0, 50 
at the mean and 100 at + 3.0c. 
Example: A problem failed by 3 per cent of a large number of pupils 
is scored 35; one failed by 80.09 per cent is scored 64, etc.

  PREFACE 
Tus little book is based upon lectures to students 
in training and to evening classes of teachers. It is 
hoped that in their present form the opinions and 
suggestions will be found useful to other young teachers, 
and even to some with riper experience. 
My aim has been to deal simply and clearly with the 
problems which often perplex those teachers who have 
had no definite historical training and do not specialize 
in History teaching. Why should we teach History in 
schools ? What parts shall we select for our scheme ? 
What books can we consult for the subject-matter ? 
What illustrations can we use? ‘What place should 
‘original sources have in our teaching? Is dramatiza- 
"tion of any value ? How can we connect History with 
Literature, Art, and Handwork? These are some of the 
questions which I am often asked and have here tried 
to answer. The advice I have given is practical, since 
it is the outcome not of theorizing, but of many years’ 
experience as a teacher.

   CHAPTER I 
THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 
‘The advantages found in History seem to be of three kinds, as 
it amuses the fancy, as it improves the understanding, and <s it 
strengthens virtue. —HvumE. 
‘ As nothing teaches, so nothing delights more than History. ‘fhe 
first of these recommends it to the study of grown men: the latter 
makes one think it the fittest for a young lad.’—Locxe, 
            
            
      
      
  AurHouei universally taught in schools, history is 
still considered one of the less important subjects of 
the.curriculum. In elementary schools even in the 
upper classes less time is often devoted to it than 
to ‘spellings’ or ‘copy-books’; in secondary schools 
classics, mathematics, modern languages, and natural 
science hold more dignified places. This subordinate 
position is due partly to tradition, partly to the teacher 
not recognizing its educative value. The latter point 
was well illustrated recently by a head master who had 
included in the history scheme some lessons on the 
history of China, to be taken in-eonnexion with the 
geography of that country. When asked why he did 
not teach Chinese language and literature he was 
naturally puzzled by the futility of the question. 
Such subjects, of course, were of no use. ‘ But are 
lessons on the old kings of China of any use?’ ‘Ah, 
well, that is history and it does not matter a great deal 
what we teach.’ This attitude is fairly common. 
Codes and Regulations require that children should 
have some knowledge of history, but many teachers          
      
                              
-P-A-G-E-8
8 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  are not convinced of its value. They have no definite 
objective in their work, no enthusiasm, and little 
historical knowledge. History has accordingly been 
more neglected than any other subject of the curri- 
culum. If, then, there is to be any improvement, 
teachers must have faith in the subject, they must be 
convinced it is worth teaching. This is the problem 
of the present chapter. 
But there are many who hold it to be impossible 
to teach history to children. ‘It seems clear that if 
we start teaching any sort of formal history to a child 
under fourteen we shall be teaching what will be to the 
child unintelligible rubbish.’+ In the following chapters, 
then, the further task will be attempted of showing 
that history can be taught to children. Suggestions 
will be made regarding selection of matter and methods 
of work in order to demonstrate that even children 
under the age of fourteen can understand at least the 
main lines of national growth. 
I. History as the Study of Social Development. At the 
outset of our inquiry concerning the value of history in 
the school, we must consider whether we are justified 
in including it in the curriculum at all. We must not 
merely show that history is of some value to the child. 
Time is short and the curriculum is crowded, and we 
must be convinced that history can do something for 
the child that no other subject can. 
‘Man’, says Emerson, ‘is explicable by nothing 
less than all his history ;’ not the history of individuals 
alone but also of human society. Our laws and systems 
of government, our manners and customs and modes

-P-A-G-E-9
  THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 9 
of living, our industrial and commercial life, our religious 
and social ideals ; all these can only be really under- 
stood in the light of their history. The thousand 
phases of that complex organism which we call ‘ national 
life have been gradually evolved from a primitive social 
state. And this process of development is continuous 
and ever changing to meet the changing needs of man. 
“In society, as in nature, the structure is continuotis, 
and we can trace things back uninterruptedly until 
we dimly descry the Declaration of Independence in 
the forests of Germany.’! This continuity of growth, 
of development in human society is the: great truth 
which history alone can teach. ‘No one can long 
study history without being haunted by the idea of 
development, of progress." Our pupils, especially 
the younger ones, will find it difficult to appreciate 
this view of history, since their minds are untrained 
to grasp long series of changes. But the teacher aims, 
not at tracing any phase of our national life step by 
step through all its changes, but at indicating the main 
stages of progress, and leading the child to make 
comparisons between one period and another. For 
example, any child in the upper classes can understand 
the great improvements in our central and local 
government, and in the administration of justice, 
although it would be folly to attempt a continuous 
history of government or the law. 
But apart from any definite study of development 
at all, history can interpret much which comes within 
the horizon of our experience to-day. An ancient ruin 
or parish church, when studied in the light of its history,

-P-A-G-E-10
  10 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
speaks to us of the lives of the people and their religious 
ideals. The ringing of the curfew bell, which is con- 
tinued in some places, is only explicable if we know 
something of conditions of living in Norman times. 
The custom of carrying a hideous representation of 
a dragon through the streets of Norwich, which was 
continued on a certain day each year until recently, 
was childish folly to those who did not know the sig- 
nificance of the custom. The dragon, Old Snap, as it 
was familiarly named, was the last relic of the pageant 
of the ancient Gild of St. George in Norwich, which 
became united with the City Corporation in the fifteenth 
century. It was thus the symbol of civic government, 
and before the Municipal Corporation Act figured in 
the corporation procession. The list of such illustra- 
tions might be increased indefinitely. There is no 
village upon the present life of which history could not 
shed some light ; there is no tradition or custom or 
popular saying in the land for which history could not 
provide an explanation, were we only able to gain 
the evidence. ‘Think what a rich world this is for 
those people to whom it is the visible result of the 
teeming activities of a thousand interesting personages 
whose bones were dust and whose tools were rust 
centuries ago! And how poor to those who know it 
only as the little street in which they live and the 
persons about them from day to day !’? 
This, then, is one good reason why we should teach 
a child to recognize the present as the outcome of the 
past. He gains a more lively and intelligent interest 
in the present, and his understanding of the world 
around is thereby increased. We want to know, as 
1 P. A. Barnett, Common Sense in Education, p. 261.
-P-A-G-E-11
  THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 11 
Lord Morley says, ‘ what men thought and did in the 
thirteenth century, not out of any dilettante or idle 
antiquarian curiosity, but because the thirteenth 
century is at the root of what men think and do in 
the nineteenth’. But the study of national development 
has further value. Even the young child is impressed 
with the immense progress of human society. There 
was a time when judges could be bribed or intimidated 
by the king; when law cases were often unduly 
protracted ; when there was no Habeas Corpus Act ; 
when debtors were imprisoned indefinitely ; when 
men were executed for petty theft. There was a time 
when women and children were protected by no factory 
legislation ; when municipal government was corrupt; 
when the streets of our towns were narrow, dark, and 
evil smelling ; when means of communication were 
bad in the extreme. Such comparisons make us 
realize the advantages of the present. ‘ The lines are 
fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have 
a goodly heritage ;’ this sentiment history should 
implant even in the child. But the children of to-day 
are the citizens of to-morrow. We cannot, then, be 
content if they only recognize their future rights as 
citizens and the countless blessings they inherit from 
the past ; we must, if possible, teach them that rights 
and duties are correlative. This truth can be taught 
without the aid of history, but history, in teaching us 
that development is continuous, should remind us of 
our responsibility towards the future. The strength 
and well-being of the nation in times to come is depen- 
dent to a great extent upon the citizens of to-day. 
In the history lessons with older children we shall often 
find opportunities for emphasizing this great principle.  
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Can the study of national development do more 
than this for the child? If our national life is the 
outcome of continuous evolution there are no questions 
of public interest to-day, whether they are political, 
social, economic, or religious, upon which history 
cannot shed some light. History does, indeed, help 
us in our attempt to comprehend the many problems 
in which every man and woman should take an intelli- 
gent interest ; it is ‘an indispensable element in the 
training of a citizen’! But we are teaching children, 
not men and women. And the historical knowledge 
that is so essential if we are to form a sound opinion 
upon a public question is often quite beyond the 
mental grasp of children. For example, most teachers 
will agree that it is both unnecessary and impossible 
that children ‘should grasp the futility of attempting 
to deal with political questions as abstract proposi- 
tions’.’ It is not in the elementary schools alone that 
our future citizens will receive their training for the exer- 
cise of their powers. The home, political clubs, trade 
unions, municipal and general elections, and, above all, 
the popular press will have a profound influence on 
their opinions. It is only after school-days are over 
that these influences will be felt to any extent and 
opinions formed. These opinions may be, and indeed 
often are, crude and dogmatic. The study of history 
must therefore be continued so that the understanding 
may be enlightened on the problems of our national 
life. In school we can lay a foundation by teaching 
the children something of the origin and history of 
many features of this national life, but it is quite 
1 Report of a Conference on the Teaching of History in London 
Elementary Schools, p. 8. 2 Ibid.; p. 9.
-P-A-G-E-13
   THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 13 
  impossible to give children an historical background 
so clear and full that it will definitely influence their 
opinions when they possess the rights and duties of 
citizens< 
IL.( History as the Study of Great Characters and of 
Types. So far we have considered history as the study 
of communal development. But the young boy is 
incapable of appreciating development. ‘He is inevit- 
ably a hero worshipper, and we must select stories 
which will rouse his feelings and stir his imagination. 
These stories must be personal and human, they must 
be alive with action if they are to interest him. When 
the emotions and imagination have been aroused and 
the child becomes interested in the story of the past, 
a foundation has been laid for the later study of develop- 
ment. But even when teaching older pupils we must 
not lose sight of the personal aspect of history, for not 
‘only does it make the subject more vivid and real, but 
it increases our knowledge of human nature» 
This latter point is often doubted. And we must 
admit that the knowledge of our fellow men, which is 
so essential if we are to make the most of life, does 
undoubtedly come rather by taking our part in the 
world of human activity than by the study of books. 
A child profits immensely by being educated with other 
children. He gradually learns to know their ways 
and motives and aspirations; he feels himself a member 
of a community, is able to hold his own with them 
and to live on amicable terms with them. When 
school-days are over, the boy will extend the circle of 
his acquaintances. If he is wise, he will enrich his 
experience by forming friendships outside the range 
of his business and by acquaintance with men whose   
-P-A-G-E-14
       14 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY    
      
                                                         ideals and whose religious and political beliefs differ 
from his own. 
Our opportunities are limited, however, for knowing 
others by personal relations. There are human types 
and leaders of men with whom we can never be per- 
sonally acquainted. It is here that history will come 
to our aid. Most of the great ones of the earth, great 
in heart and find and achievement, can only be known 
by studying their aspirations and thoughts and deeds 
as recorded in history. The poorest child may make 
the acquaintance of the proudest and noblest of men 
in the pages of history. Horace Walpole in one of his 
letters says, in reference to the Paston Letters: ‘ The 
letters of Henry VI’s reign, &c. are come out, and to 
me make all other letters not worth reading. I have 
gone through one volume and cannot bear to be writ- 
ing when I am so eager to be reading... . There are 
letters from all my acquaintance, Lord Rivers, Lord 
Hastings, the Earl of Warwick.’ History as a subject 
of the curriculum is not alone in revealing human 
nature. The study of literature is possibly of equal 
value in this respect, although history portrays human 
nature as it really is, literature as it is interpreted by 
an author. 
Ill. The Development of the Mind by the Study of 
History. Many teachers consider that this subject 
provides mental training by developing the children’s 
powers of reasoning, judgement, imagination, memory, 
and so on. These claims deserve a brief examination. 
(a) First, as to the value of history in improving 
the ‘reasoning’ and ‘judgement’. The problems of 
history generally set to a class in order to develop the 
power of reasoning are essentially different from the
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 15 
problems of natural science. The children are often 
asked what the effects of a certain action would be 
likely to be, e.g. was a certain speech of Elizabeth’s 
likely to satisfy the Commons? Or they are asked for 
the causes of certain events; e.g. what were the 
circumstances which led to the Catholic reaction after 
1539? Now such questions will undoubtedly stimulate 
the children to read more carefully and will suggest 
certain topics for investigation. The private study of 
the pupils, where private study is possible, will there- 
fore be more profitable and the children will be induced 
to consider more carefully the facts bearing upon the 
problem. But the generalizations are not the outcome 
of scientific reasoning ; they are rather expressions of 
opinion. 
Men’s lives are not governed by general laws. I 
know that if heat is applied to water under normal 
pressure until the temperature is raised to 100° C., 
it will boil. This is an established law. But I do not 
know that a man placed in certain circumstances will 
act in a particular way. We cannot predict with 
certainty * man’s conduct as we can predict the 
manifestat of Nature’s laws: neither can we solve 
historical prouiems by applying general truths to them,. 
or establish general truths from the examination 
of a series of particular facts. But this we must be 
able to do if we are to reason scientifically. Philo- 
sophers do indeed tell us that the same causes always 
produce the same effects. This may be true even in 
history, but, unlike science, history often gives us 
no adequate opportunities of studying the causes of 
which we see the effects. The veil is drawn more 
closely across the face of history than across the face
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of external nature and we cannot draw it aside, partly 
because the records of the past are defective, and 
partly because the infinite motives at the root of 
human conduct are hidden from us. The most casual 
student of history realizes that the apparently acci- 
dental plays too large a part in the course of events 
for history ever to be reduced to a science. ‘ If the 
nose of Cleopatra had been shorter the whole face of 
the earth would have been changed,’ says Pascal. 
It is true that many great events appear to us the 
result of general causes. Slavery is followed by econo- 
mic decay ; war by privation and economic unrest ; 
tyranny by rebellion; corrupt government by ultimate 
loss of power. Butsuch consequences are not inevitable. 
On the other hand, if Alexander the Great had died 
in infancy, if the attempt on Napoleon’s life on Christ- 
mas Eve 1800 had been successful, if the storm which 
shattered the Armada had not arisen, if the Greeks 
had been defeated at Marathon, the Franks at ChAlons, 
or the Normans at Hastings, how the history of the 
world might have been changed! It is futile to con- 
sider these possibilities, except in so far as they 
help us to realize how the course of history appears 
to have been repeatedly governed by an event that 
no amount of study of other causes and results in 
history would have helped us to determine. ‘ Strictly 
logical argument is- always abstract ; life is always 
concrete.’ * 
We cannot frame general laws and apply them in 
history in order to discover causes and effects; that 
1 Teachers should read Froude, Short Studies on Great Subjects, 
vol. i, The Science of History. 
2 Welton, Psychology of Education, p. 394,
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 17 
is, we cannot reason scientifically because of the nature 
of the subject. But history must still remain to a great 
extent a study of causes and effects. In the upper 
part of the school we must emphasize the great truth 
that every event in history was the development of 
preceding events, for it is only in this way that the 
children will come to understand history as the study 
of development. Sometimes we can lead our older 
pupils to predict fairly accurately for themselves, 
through their knowledge of history and of things in 
general, that a certain line of action or set of circum- 
stances would result in a certain way, or that a certain 
event had a certain cause or causes. They are, with 
guidance, discovering for themselves the relations 
between events. Totakea simple example. In studying 
the history of the reforms of the nineteenth century, 
it is not sufficient for older children to know what 
were the chief reforms. They must know something 
about the conditions preceding these reforms, and 
should even know what brought about these conditions. 
Having learnt something about the introduction of 
machinery, the children should then be led to form the 
opinion that (1) it was almost inevitable that child 
labour would be employed to a greater extent than 
before ; (2) the conditions of work would often become 
degrading ; (3) some humane persons would revolt 
against such conditions and demand an inquiry; 
(4) the Government would side with the public unless 
influenced by private considerations, and legislation 
would be passed to remedy the evil; and (5) the legisla- 
tion could only be effective if means of enforcing it 
were provided. 
Any topic will provide opportunities for so-called 
1977 B
-P-A-G-E-18
18 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
reasoning of this kind, although through the inter- 
vention of the accidental in history the children are 
usually not able to work out a chain of developments 
as in the above example. The teacher, then, should 
not invite an expression of opinion unless the children 
are likely to arrive at the correct conclusion. Where 
the consequences of an event or set of circumstances 
cannot possibly be predicted, or where, in the case of 
younger children, their lack of knowledge prevents 
them coming to a conclusion that would be apparent 
to maturer minds, a continuous narrative is necessary 
in which the connexions between events are demon- 
strated. Suppose, for example, the children are studying 
the Civil War in Yorkshire, and the teacher is giving 
them an account of the events connected with Leeds, 
Bradford, and other places. It is not sufficient to tell 
the children what took place. Emphasis must be laid 
on the reasons for the events taking place where and 
when they did. In describing the siege of Leeds the 
teacher must show how it came about that it was 
defended by Royalists and attacked by Fairfax; 
how it happened that the Parliamentarians came from 
the west ; why Fairfax divided his forces; and why 
the Royalists were defeated. 
Let us now consider a somewhat different case. 
History often appears contradictory in its estimate 
of great men. From the available evidence we may 
portray Cromwell as the ruthless warrior or the saintly 
Puritan, Elizabeth as the weak woman or the hard- 
headed leader of her Council, Mary as the cruel perse- 
cutor or the deserted wife. In each of these cases 
neither picture is accurate although it contains much 
of truth. If we would form a true estimate of the \ 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  ee TR Re eS Re a ee 
THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 19 
character of a person in history, we must have sufficient 
evidence and be able to use the evidence. History 
often fails usin our search for sufficient evidence ; but 
even if we suppose it at our disposal, we have still the 
task of weighing it, deciding what is relevant and 
what irrelevant, putting the facts in their right per- 
spective, and testing these facts about the actions of 
a person by some standard of value which we must 
already have formed. 
Three conclusions follow : 
1. History often gives us an opportunity for weighing 
evidence and arriving at an opinion concerning some 
question. The conclusion at which we arrive, after 
weighing the probabilities, must be a reasonable one. 
Its truth can never be demonstrated in the same 
way as a conclusion in mathematics or natural science, 
Whether the conclusion is reasonable or not depends 
upon the selection we make of the evidence and the 
relative importance we give to the facts selected. 
Such tasks are too difficult for children. They often 
require a grasp of a wide range of facts, power of select- 
ing facts, of estimating their relative importance and 
of forming general conclusions from them, such as 
we cannot expect ito find in any but persons with more 
developed minds and greater knowledge. Generally 
in matters of opinion the class needs careful guidance, 
Suppose, for example, this problem is set to a class 
for solution: ‘If Wolsey had been made Pope, would 
this have been a good thing for (a) the Church ; (6) 
England; (c) Europe?’ Such a question is an 
excellent inducement to reading and thought. And

and Exercises, No, 186.

-P-A-G-E-20
   
   20 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
if the state of the Church, and Wolsey’s character and 
aims have been fully explained by the teacher or 
the text-book, the boys may, no doubt, readily arrive 
at the conclusion that the Church would have benefited 
by Wolsey’s election. But this will not be so much the 
opinion of the boys as that of the teacher or the book. 
Careful preparation has made such a conclusion almost 
inevitable. 
2. In the second place, we have seen that history is 
concerned with the development of events, movements, 
and institutions, and. is therefore to a very great 
extent the study of causes and effects ; that is, of the 
relations between particular groups of facts. These 
relations can sometimes be discovered by the children, 
but must often be pointed out by the teacher or the 
history book. 
3. The third conclusion is, that history, rightly 
taught, will help the child to become critical and 
thoughtful. Throughout life, instead of accepting 
unhesitatingly the ready-made opinions of others or 
being guided by blind prejudice, he will have the 
tendency to investigate problems for himself and 
to form sound judgements. And instead of accepting 
facts merely as facts he will desire to discover their 
relations with other facts by tracing their causes and 
effects. Moreover, he will be gaining ability in handling 
knowledge. History demands the arrangement of 
knowledge, the careful consideration of its value, and 
the comparison of facts. This gives the child greater 
mental grasp, and greater capacity for using his 
knowledge. These results, no doubt, can be obtained 
in other ways; yet history, whilst failing to give 
opportunities for scientific reasoning, is one of the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 21 
fitting subjects for providing such mental training in 
older pupils. 
(6) The imagination of the child is also considered 
to be developed by the study of history. But what 
do we mean by ‘ developing the imagination’? We 
have witnessed a terrible accident or-a great fire, and 
some time afterwards we can close our eyes and see in 
imagination the whole scene; we can feel again the 
horror which took possession of us at the time, and can 
hear again the cry of those in distress. This power to 
reproduce our own earlier experience is called Repro- 
ductive Imagination. Again, we are listening to a 
graphic description of the Great Pyramid, and as the 
traveller proceeds with his account we can shut our 
eyes and slowly the scene unfolds itself. We see the 
glistening sand, the cloudless sky, the mountain of 
stone, the Arabs and tourists on their donkeys. Or 
we may be reading a novel. The scenes and incidents 
are fictions of the author’s brain; yet we get intensely 
interested. We can readily form mental pictures of 
the scenes described, our emotions are easily aroused, 
and we may even become enamoured of the hero or 
heroine. Such imagination is termed Constructive. 
Or again, I am sitting quietly smoking and weave 
castles in the air. Such spontaneous imagination 
which does not seem to arise through any external 
agency is termed Creative. 
It is at once seen that historical imagination can be 
only constructive or creative; it is usually the former. 
When telling stories to children we do what we can 
to aid them in visualizing the scenes described. It is 
exceptional for a child to be unable to visualize the 
incidents of a story, for children usually have a riotous
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
imagination that requires little encouragement. It is 
equally exceptional for them to visualize at all accu- 
rately if the story is far removed from their own little 
world. As the child grows older the work in history 
becomes to some extent more abstract. He is no 
longer limited to picturesque stories but begins to 
study general movements, where the imagination has 
less scope. Moreover, his increasing experience of the 
world sobers his imagination ; the scenes of history 
are often more truly pictured in his mind and the 
pictures are less gaily coloured. 
This constructive imagination which arises through 
the narrative of the teacher is dependent upon two 
conditions. The child must have formed the necessary 
ideas upon which the images are based. If he is without 
correct ideas then correct images are of course impos- 
sible. We should therefore introduce into the story 
no ideas that are strange to the child without making 
them clear. Further, the child must have the power 
to attend continuously to the story. As the narrative 
which he is hearing or reading proceeds, he must be 
able to control the mental images as they are formed 
and combine them in the development of the mental 
picture. He cannot do this unless he can concentrate 
his attention, since memory will not come to his aid 
as in reproductive imagination. 
But have children sufficient historical knowledge 
and power of attention to enable them to form a succes- 
sion of clear mental pictures such as a story of average 
length demands? There will often be the danger of 
the child not knowing exactly what the teacher is 
talking about. Often he will be unable to concentrate 
his attention, especially when the story is tedious or
-P-A-G-E-23
       
                         
         
                       
      
                               THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 238 
   too difficult to comprehend, or the child is tired or 
there are strong counter-attractions. 
What do we mean, then, when we speak of history 
developing the imagination of the child? The tendency 
to visualize or to feel strong emotional excitement as 
the result of the visualization is probably more vigorous 
in a young child than in a grown man. The work of \ 
the teacher, then, is not to foster something which is | 
feeble. It is to ensure that the child’s images are / 
approximately accurate and to enable him to develop 
from these images scenes which are in accordance 
with historical truth. If the teacher succeeds in doing , 
this, he will have made the subject more real to his 
pupils, he will have given them a foundation of histori- 
cal truth which can be vividly recalled, and he will 
have trained the child to concentrate his attention and 
follow intelligently the words of another. The teacher’s 
success in doing this will depend upon the wise use of 
illustrations and his ability in oral work. 
But the historical imagination which we try to 
cultivate in our pupils should not be merely construc- 
tive. We hope to foster a certain tendency of mind 
that will enable the child throughout life to be attracted 
by historical associations and create for himself scenes 
of long ago. ‘Happy is that boy who having so 
“ grown up with ” the story of his country, can people 
the fields and lanes of his home with the figures of the 
past; can hear the clatter of Rupert’s horsemen down 
his village street, and can picture the good monks 
catching baskets full of trout in the stream (there were 
more trout in it before the Reformation) wherein he 
is failing to get a rise.’+ To view the cloister of an

abbey and people it with monks of long ago; to visit 
an old house and stand in a room where Queen Eliza- 
beth once dined, a room dusty and forlorn but in our 
imagination gay with the brightness of the sixteenth- 
century court; to stand within a British encampment 
and conjure up the scene when the tribe was attacked 
by the oncoming Romans: such excursions among 
scenes so different from anything we may witness to-day 
give infinite pleasure and raise us above our everyday 
surroundings. Thomas Hardy, in describing one of 
his characters, says, ‘ He frequently walked the heath 
alone, when the past seized upon him with its shadowy 
hand, and held him there to listen to its tale. His 
imagination would then people the spot with the ancient 
inhabitants: forgotten Celtic tribes trod their tracks 
about him, and he could almost live among them, look 
in their faces, and see them standing beside the barrows 
which swelled around, untouched and perfect as at 
the time of their erection.’ + 
The power to visualize is not, however, commensurate 
with historical knowledge. Many of us, as we grow 
older, find ourselves less inclined to free ourselves from 
the present and really imagine the scenes of history. 
Yet objects and places with historical associations retain 
to the full their charm for us. We may be intensely 
interested without being imaginative. What we should 
endeavour to implant in the children is therefore not 
only the power to visualize, and to have their emotions 
stirred, but also a deep abiding interest and reverence 
in all things which are relics of a past age. If we invest 
with the charm of romance old ruins, old manuscripts, 
old remains of any kind, that are reminiscent of other

times, our pupils will learn to regard them with a rever- 
ence demanded by their age alone even apart from 
associations. They have survived the vicissitudes of 
centuries and are entitled to respect, even though 
now they may be broken and unsightly. 
(c) Little need be said concerning the value of 
history in training the memory. The old notion that 
we have a general faculty of memory which is capable 
of improvement in a diversity of ways has been laid 
to. rest. We remember usually, if not always, by 
association, not by virtue of a mysterious general 
faculty of memory. ‘The secret of a good memory 
is thus the secret of forming diverse and multiple 
associations with every fact we care to retain.’ + These 
associations can only be formed if the mind already 
has a stock of ideas of a similar kind. with which the 
new fact can be associated. A further condition is 
that the attention must be directed to the new facts 
if they are to be recalled in the future. The attention 
may be deliberately concentrated upon the matter 
to be learnt, in which case the learning of historical 
facts does give training in mental concentration and 
a power is being developed which is essential in all 
study. Or the attention may be naturally attracted 
by what is intrinsically interesting or novel or startling, 
in which case there is no such training. 
Historical facts, then, are more readily recalled as 
the study of history proceeds, not because our ‘memory’ 
has been improved, but because our historical ideas 
have been increasing in number so that new facts can 
be more securely associated in the mind, whilst the 
power of concentrated attention has, at the same

time, been developed, making it easier to form these 
associations. 
IV. The Moral Value of History Teaching. The 
last important result of the study of history is the 
“strengthening of virtue’. Among teachers we find 
much apparent divergence of opinion as to the moral 
value of this subject. On the one hand, there are those 
who consider history teaching should be ‘a series of 
object-lessons in morals’! On the other hand, there 
are many who hold that ‘the study of history would 
seem to serve for intellectual very much more .than 
for moral progress’.? On examination these views 
will be found to be not widely opposed. The important 
point is whether history is of value as a direct or only 
as an indirect teacher of morals. 
Bolingbroke in his well-known aphorism remarks 
that ‘ History is philosophy teaching by examples how 
to conduct ourselves in all the situations of private 
and public life’. We may add that the examples are 
just such as we may choose, for ‘you may justify 
anything by a pointed example in history ’.® Bishop 
Stubbs believed that one of the most important results 
to be obtained from the study of history is the attain- 
ment of a ‘ perception of the workings of the Almighty 
Ruler of the World’, the recognition of ‘a hand of 
justice and mercy, a hand of progress and order, a kind 
and wise disposition ever leading the world on to the 
better’. Such perception may not be given to trained 
historians ; in schools, of course, we must take no

-P-A-G-E-27
  THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 27 
account of any such possible result of the study of 
history. We must beware of teaching that goodness 
always prevails, that wickedness must ultimately 
receive its deserts. To do this is to lead the children 
to measure goodness by success and to train them to 
love justice and goodness and truth not for themselves 
alone, but for the sake of the material benefits which 
are supposed to accrue. It would be far better if the 
children could believe that ‘for every false word or 
unrighteous deed, for cruelty and oppression, for lust 
or vanity, the price has to be paid at last, not always 
by the chief offenders, but paid by some one’ But 
we must not attempt to teach this truth directly. 
It is a common plan for teachers to select the lives 
of a number of great men and centre their teaching 
round them. If such lessons are given to younger 
children we often elevate the persons into the position 
of heroes. This is well, for young children can only 
understand simple natures. ‘A man is wholly good or 
wholly bad, and we shall fail in our teaching if we 
attempt to portray to young children the complex 
character ‘of any one of the great men or women of 
history\\ John is the tyrant and the young child cannot 
understand that there is any good in hisreign. Welling- 
ton is the hero of Waterloo and we shall create a blurred 
effect in the children’s minds if we attempt to blend 
with that an account of his shortcomings in his political 
career. Raleigh is a gallant gentleman and we must 
suppress his jealousy and love of royal approbation. 
But in keeping the character simple, in abstaining from 
portraying the whole man, let us clearly understand 
that what we teach is neither history nor biography.

-P-A-G-E-28
28 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  We are preparing the way by telling historical stories, 
in which we present the truth only in part. 
In teaching young children, then, it is of little 
importance that we give a one-sided view of any topic. 
We do so, not that moral results may follow, but that 
our teaching may be more effective. On the other hand, 
our aim in upper classes is to teach the truth, and to 
do this we must introduce much that is evil into our 
story. If we suppress the evil, whether in an individual 
or a period, we give the child incorrect ideas about the 
past ; we distort history that our teaching may have 
a good moral effect. But the main aim of history 
teaching is to trace development,and ‘unless the teacher 
lays stress upon the ugliness and the brutality of past 
ages it is difficult to bring home the fact that there has 
been a true progress’.1 If our main aim is indeed 
a moral one, we can attain it far better by leaving 
history alone. Legends are preferable to history for 
the teaching of morals. By attempting to make our 
history teaching a series of moral tales we tamper 
with the subject and make it flabby. History will never 
be any preparation for life if we make the mistake of 
thinking that the subject-matter is restricted to the lives 
of all the world’s greatest and noblest men and women. 
This idea does, however, prevail. Teachers, especially 
in elementary schools, sometimes consider that the 
children should have examples put before them, for imita- 
tion or the reverse, of the great characters of history. 
This view presupposes that we can label great men as_ 
having good or evil influence. But can we do this? 
It is true, the influence of some great personalities 
appears to have been wholly good, as Florence Nightin- 
1 Keatinge, Studies in the Teaching of History, p. 106. :
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY TEACHING 29 
gale and many social reformers, whilst the influence of 
some others seems to have been wholly bad, as some 
of the later Roman emperors; but these are great 
exceptions. The greatest personalities have generally 
had no such unmixed influence. The character of 
most men is exceedingly complex. And if we ask 
whether the influence of Marcus Aurelius or of Wolsey 
was for good or evil, such a question is almost meaning- 
less. The question arises at once, ‘His influence in 
what branch of life?’ 
If we deliberately select great characters as examples 
‘or imitation or the reverse there is a further difficulty. 
We are supposing that we can take pattern of them if 
good, or avoid their evil ways if wicked. But in the 
great majority of cases we cannot imitate. The actions 
of great men, if studied carefully, appear almost 
inevitable and it is puerile to consider whether their 
~ ‘example’ should be copied or avoided. What example 
did Napoleon, Caesar, Pericles, Wellington, King John, 
or Henry VIII set in their actions which affected history 
that can be imitated or avoided? It is true children 
may admire some of the virtues of great men, as the 
pluck of Columbus, the saintliness of St. Francis, the 
courage of the Black Prince, or the singleness of purpose 
of Wilberforce. But it is no more likely that they 
will consciously imitate the virtues of these men than 
that they will copy the duplicity of Elizabeth, the 
servility of Wolsey, the dishonesty of Marlborough, 
or the profligacy of George IV. 
Enough has been said to show that the moral results, 
whilst they are very real and very important, must 
follow indirectly. If our main aim be to help the child 
towards understanding the world of human activity
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
in which he lives, then our teaching will assuredly have 
a good moral effect. 
What are the moral results which we may fairly 
expect to follow from our teaching ? 
In the first place, the child’s mind will be broadened. 
‘To the vulgar person everything which cannot be 
stated in terms current and familiar is ridiculous, 
strange, and uncouth; the historical atmosphere, then, 
must help our pupils to realize, pictorially in the first 
instance, other ages and other lands.’1 Both history 
and geography in this respect may be compared with 
travel ; they teach the children the truth of the old say- 
ing that ‘ there are also people beyond the mountains ’. 
Then again, history, as we have seen, is to some 
extent a study of human nature, and who can live 
in close acquaintance with the great characters of the 
past without being inspired with feelings of sympathy 
and love, admiration and reverence, contempt and 
scorn ? And when the child’s feelings are being roused 
in the right way, his character is, of a certainty, being 
developed. 
Lastly, we have already seen that history, as the 
study of national development, will impress upon our 
older pupils their indebtedness towards the Past and 
their duties towards the Future. We should endeavour 
to foster in them the spirit of Robert Browning’s line : 
Here and here did England help me ; 
How can I help England ? 
It is this desire to do something for our country that 
is at the root of all healthy patriotism.

  CHAPTER II 
THE CONTENT OF THE SCHEME 
TuE construction of a carefully thought-out scheme 
of work involves a twofold task. A selection must be 
made from the vast mass of material at our disposal, 
which in extent will be in accordance with the time 
allotted to history teaching and in difficulty will be 
suited to the mental standard of our pupils. And this 
selected material must be arranged in such a way 
that the aspect of history as a study of development 
is emphasized throughout the history course of the 
school. Two questions, then, await solution—What 
topics shall we teach? and, What shall be the form of 
the scheme embodying these topics? The first of 
these will be considered in this chapter. 
At the outset we must select some central idea upon 
which the whole scheme is to be based, a common 
thread which runs through all the work. In the last 
chapter we arrived at the conclusion that our main 
purpose in history teaching should be to help the child 
to comprehend in some degree the present world of 
human thought and activity. But how will this 
principle guide our selection of a theme ? 
History in its widest sense should teach us how 
mankind has gradually developed from primaeval times 
to the present day. Logically, then, we should 
begin with early mankind and trace the gradual 
development of the modern civilized nations. A great 
gulf separates the earliest human type from modern
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
man; materially, socially, mentally, and spiritually 
we are immeasurably superior to our tree-dwelling 
ancestors. But can we reveal this progress to the child ? 
Can he survey the whole field of history and compre- 
hend the slow development of the race? Of course 
not. He can, indeed, understand the improvement in 
man’s material surroundings. The young child can 
readily realize that he is infinitely more secure and 
comfortable than the primitive savage, and is interested 
to learn how this has come about. Older children might 
also be able to understand the motives that have led 
men to group themselves into communities, and the 
events that gave birth to the chief nations of modern 
Europe; but the intellectual and spiritual develop- 
ment of man, which is even more important than 
material and political progress, when contrasting 
modern man with his earliest ancestors, is a subject 
only for the mature mind. A further reason prevents 
us attempting to teach the general development of 
mankind. Each race has had its own cultural history. 
‘ One cannot undertake to impart a world culture, for 
no one knows where it is to be found, but only to 
provide wholesome and digestible nourishment for the 
pupil’s interest by introducing him to the development 
of the national life.’ + 
Some educationists, as Rein, would have us make 
the development of national life the centre of the whole 
curriculum. This view is based upon two principles : 
1. The principle of concentration. We are told that 
the child’s life is a unity,” and that on the other hand

Child. ,
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE CONTENT OF THE SCHEME 33 
the work of the school is usually divided into clearly- 
marked ‘ subjects’, having little connexion with each 
other. It follows that the curriculum is not in harmony 
with the life of the child and must therefore be unified. 
An examination of this principle would be out of place 
here, as we are only concerned with its practical value 
in history teaching. Even if we determined that it was 
in theory admirable, yet in practice we should find it 
impossible to select any topic round which all the chief 
branches of instruction might be grouped. The most 
we can do, if we select the development of the nation 
as the central topic for history teaching, is to connect 
with it the Literature and Geography, and to some 
extent, the Art and Singing. 
2. The principle of the historical stages of culture. 
A doctrine which has found many supporters and has 
much to commend it is that there is a close parallel 
between the eras of development in the race and the 
periods of development in the individual. Attempts 
have been made! to harmonize the chief stages in the 
development of the race and the child, and to select 
material for instruction in each period connected with 
that particular stage of race development. The 
attempts made are, however, unconvincing. It is true 
there is ‘a gradual national development from super- 
stition, ignorance, and unruly will power, to enlighten- 
ment, understanding, and the joint will of a good 
government’ ;* and we find a similar development in 
the child. But is it seriously argued that since a child 
is superstitious, ignorant, and unruly, therefore the 
material of his education is most fittingly selected from

34 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  the period in the history of the race when it had these 
characteristics ? 
Since this theory cannot be established with any 
certainty it will not be taken into consideration in the 
following chapters. The scheme below is, nevertheless, 
based on the assumption that our main aim in history 
teaching should be to trace the development of the 
nation in order to give the child an understanding of 
our national life to-day. 
This being the main theme, what periods and topics 
shall we select ? 
I. The child must have a sound knowledge of the 
/ evolution of England as one of the great nations of 
the world. He must know how she became a great 
political power, how her trade and industries have 
grown. He must also be acquainted with the well- 
—~being6f the people at different periods and the history 
of the Church, so far as it affected the lives of the 
people. These are topics of the first importance, and 
the scheme must make provision for them. But what 
principle shall guide us in selecting material from the 
political, economic, and social history of England ? 
Some would have us consider what are the chief 
features of English life to-day and trace their origin 
and growth. If we adhere to this rule rigidly we must 
include much that the child cannot comprehend, such 
as our legal system, party government, the relations 
between capital and labour, and the history of thought 
and morals. A safer guide is that ‘as a general rule 
only those facts should be selected which will help the 
child to understand how the conditions under which 
he lives arose’. But then we should omit many

-P-A-G-E-35
  THE CONTENT OF THE SCHEME 35 
picturesque incidents and heroic figures, which stir the 
feelings of the child and arouse his interest and yet 
cannot be justly included in a scheme on purely 
practical grounds. In fact, let us remember, in selecting 
material, that our aim is not only to interpret the | 
present in the light of the past. We must also increase, 
in general, the child’s knowledge of mankind and \ 
arouse interest and sympathy by means of the stories | 
of men’s thoughts and actions in the past. Such a topic” 
as the Hundred Years’ War is useful in this respect. 
The story of the struggle with France in the fourteenth 
and fifteenth centuries provides instructive contrasts 
between. past and present, and will, moreover, present 
incidents which will stir a boy’s feelings to their depths. 
This justifies its inclusion in the scheme. 
Indeed, there is some danger at the present time of 
following Spencer too closely when he says, ‘The only 
history that is of practical value is what may be called 
Descriptive Sociology ’. Much time should be devoted y_ 
to social and industrial history, yet whilst we recognize 
the importance of our pupils knowing something of 
the material progress of the race, we must not be blind 
to the necessity of them also knowing how England, 
as a state, has come to be what it is. In the reaction 
against the old dull type of history, the political side 
of our national story is in some schools being neglected. 
Let us remember that Spencer also wrote, ‘ We want< 
all facts which help us to understand how a nation has 
grown and organized itself’. In planning the details 
of a scheme of work on the development of Great 
Britain we must neglect neither the political nor the 
social side of the story, but endeavour to find a reason- 
able balance. The teaching of political history should 
c2
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
not be condemned because teachers have often made 
an unhappy selection of facts to be taught. Social 
history, indeed, in the hands of an incompetent 
teacher may be a monotonous record of material 
progress, as lifeless and dull as a record of changes of 
ministries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 
It isnot only within the last few years that the impor- 
tance of social history has been emphasized. Carlyle 
wrote in 1830 that we must not dwell ‘with dispro- 
portionate fondness in Senate-houses, in battlefields, 
nay, even in kings’ antechambers ; forgetting that 
far away irom such scenes, the mighty tide of Thought 
and Action was still rolling on its wondrous course, in 
gloom and brightness; and in its thousand remote 
valleys a whole world of existence, with or without an 
earthly sun of Happiness to warm it, with or without 
a heavenly sun of Holiness to purify and sanctify it, 
was blossoming and fading, whether the “ famous 
victory ’’ were won or lost’. 
Some account of the history of the Church, so far 
as this country is concerned, should be included. It is 
better not to draw up a separate series of lessons, but 
to introduce the facts incidentally in the course of 
other work. The Church had great influence on our 
political and constitutional history, although the 
understanding of this will be beyond most children in 
school. In Anglo-Saxon times its councils were the 
forerunners of the councils of the whole English 
nation, and pointed the way towards political unity. 
In later times the Church repeatedly resisted attempts 
of the Crown to unify England, claiming exemption 
from royal justice and royal taxation. From the 
social ‘point of view the Church fostered education and
-P-A-G-E-37
       THE CONTENT OF THE SCHEME     
    37 
   encouraged a higher type of civilization; the clergy 
were the repositories of learning and the chief means 
by which the fuller civilization of the Continent was 
in the Middle Ages brought to this country. More 
than this, there is much to-day concerning the Church 
which can only be interpreted in the light of history. 
Without history the venerable parish churches, stately 
cathedrals and ruined abbeys in this land of ours are 
dull unmeaning piles of stones, with no message of the 
ritual or spiritual ideals of our forefathers. We cannot, 
however, do more in school than prepare the way for 
the children to have an understanding of these matters 
later in life. 
II. Some time before the end of school life the pupils 
should amplify the latter part of the story of national 
development by means of a special course in eighteenth- 
and nineteenth-century history. ‘We must be cautious, 
lest, having begun to build, we are not able to finish ; 
and having begun to read history at the Norman 
Conquest, we find ourselves stranded at the Battle of 
Waterloo or earlier still.+ Many, however, consider 
that recent history is too difficult for immature minds. 
It is true we cannot lead children to solve the many 
political and social problems of the present age. But 
history will bring them to the threshold of the present 
and assist in a later study of these problems. Industrial, 
social, and imperial history can, indeed, interpret even 
for immature minds much in the life of to-day. The 
chief developments which followed the introduction 
of machinery, the problem of poverty in recent times, 
the rise of trade unions and co-operative enterprises,

   the working classes in general, the growth of popular 
education, the growth of democracy, and the expansion 
of the Empire; these subjects and others must be 
adequately treated in the upper part of the school. 
III. The history of the Empire must also be included 
in the scheme. It provides many stirring episodes 
which will appeal to the young mind, but it is useless 
to give the children a bare summary of facts and dates 
concerning the history of British India, the conquest 
and settlement of Canada, or the colonization of 
Australia or South Africa. We must select topics and 
deal with them fully. The exploits of Clive, Wellesley, 
: and Napier in India; the voyages of Captain Cook and 
the journeys of some of the early Australian explorers ; 
the conquest of Canada in the Seven Years’ War and 
the attack on Canada during the War of Independence ; 
the wars with the natives in South Africa and the 
struggles between Boers and British: excellent lessons 
can be given on such subjects as these. Much of this 
work need not be relegated to a special scheme, but is 
best taught incidentally when dealing with wider sub- 
jects. The conquest of Canada is an essential part of 
the struggle with France. France, proud and ambitious, 
was anxious for expansion on the Continent and abroad, 
and one of the principal features of the eighteenth 
century was the struggle of England against the French 
and Spanish Bourbons. Again, St. Helena, first occu- 
pied in the seventeenth century, was on the trade route 
to the East, and its occupation was a sign of the 
expanding trade and maritime power of England. 
The expansion of England in this century is further 
illustrated by the settlements in West Africa and the 
West Indies. These topics would suffer if taken out

  of their historical setting and dealt with solely as part 
of the history of the Empire. 
We cannot, however, attempt to survey the whole 
field of imperial history. Here, as in other branches 
of history, we must decide what we can leave out. 
The history of the administration of the Empire is not 
a suitable subject except for the upper forms in a 
secondary school. The children are not interested in 
learning how constitutional government was developed 
in Canada, Australia, or South Africa. Neither can 
they really understand the race problem in Canada, 
the native question in New Zealand, or the great 
unsolved problems which still confront the government 
of India. To take a simple example: In teaching 
the history of Canada it would be useless to describe 
Lord Durham’s Report and tell the children it was 
very important, if they cannot appreciate its impor- 
tance. And this they cannot do unless they are 
acquainted not only with the state of affairs in Canada 
before and after the Report, but also with the general 
colonial policy of the British Government before 1838, 
IV. Another question is how far we shall include 
constitutional history and civics in the scheme. In 
some schools the term ‘ Civics’ or ‘ Citizenship ’ is 
applied to the study of the present form of our govern- 
ment, and the rights and duties of citizens. This, of 
course, is not history, and yet boys and girls should, 
on leaving school, have some knowledge of how they 
are governed, and what their rights and responsibilities 
in the State will be. Shall we, then, draw up a scheme 
for the separate teaching of civics, as distinct from his- 
tory, and make provision for it on the time-table? Or 
shall we include the development of the constitution 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
40 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  in our history scheme? In either case the subject is 
not one which naturally attracts the youthful mind. 
‘Rights’ and ‘ Duties’, the complicated machine of 
government ; these subjects are lifeless to the child. 
If we make separate provision for the teaching of 
civics we add another subject to the already crowded 
curriculum. Further, by making our subject descrip- 
tive only of the present state of our government and 
of our rights and duties, weare apt to forget that govern- 
ment is ever changing and still in course of evolution. 
A comprehensive study of constitutional history is 
only possible with students older than most pupils even 
in a secondary school. In some elementary schools 
attempts have been made to treat the subject system- 
atically by beginning with well-known institutions, as 
a police court, the central courts in London, a royal 
judge on assize, a general election, the municipal 
election, the local education authority, and tracing 
their development in a regular series of lessons. It is 
maintained that a child is interested in his environ- 
ment and demands explanations. But in reality it is 
distinctly uninteresting for children to begin with the 
commonplace present. The starting-point is wrong. 
Children are usually much more interested in a primi- 
tive state of society, far removed in time and condition 
from their own, than in the complicated society of the 
present. Let us, then, begin with the remote past, not 
with the present. 
In most elementary schools there is not a separate 
course of any kind in constitutional history. Topics 
dealing with the growth of the national government 
are included in the general scheme. But if this general 
scheme is planned in periods of time we are met by
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE CONTENT OF THE SCHEME 41 
a serious difficulty. An important constitutional event 
may occur in a period taken by young children who 
are unable to judge of its importance. For example, 
if we arrange that children of nine or ten years of age 
should study the period 1066 to 1485, or from pre- 
historic times to 1066, because there is much attractive 
material in these periods for a young child, then consti- 
tutional topics cannot be dealt with in proportion to 
their importance. We either ignore them or deal with 
them inadequately. It would be pure folly when 
teaching young children to attempt to show the 
importance of Magna Carta or to trace the early history 
of Parliament. But before he leaves school every boy 
should know that these were landmarks in the growth 
of our constitution. The solution of the difficulty 
seems to be a series of lessons in the upper part of the 
school. The children will then learn what are the 
main forces which have contributed to form the 
modern British constitution. 
But knowledge of the development of government 
will not necessarily make our pupils good future 
citizens. No understanding of our present institutions 
and of how they come to be what they are will secure 
this result. The aphorism, ‘ Without History, Citizen- 
ship has no root; without Citizenship, History has no 
fruit’ is attractive but untrue. Moral training is more , 
important here than intellectual understanding ; not 
the moral training given by drawing up a formal code 
of moral instruction for the school and calling it 
‘Citizenship’, for it is to the discipline of the school 
and its various institutions, rather than to the direct 
lessons of the classroom, that we must look for such 
training. ‘ The teaching of patriotism and citizenship,
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
if it is to produce any effect, must be entirely informal 
and indirect.’ The recognition of authority in the 
school, the performance of school duties, the partici- 
pation in school societies and games will bear fruit in 
a sense of duty and responsibility to the school com- 
munity. This is the moral foundation of good citizen- 
ship. Some preparation can also be found in the school 
work itself, where such work is co-operative in char- 
acter or where it contributes to the betterment of the 
school community. For example, in History the pupils 
can join in the writing and production of plays; in 
Handwork, to illustrate a history topic and in the 
preparation of topics from books. 
Many schools at present do little towards providing 
such a training for citizenship, although the state of 
affairs in an up-to-date school is not so bad as Professor 
Dewey would have us believe when he says, ‘ Upon the 
ethical side, the tragic weakness of the present school 
is that it endeavours to prepare future members of the 
social order in a medium in which the conditions of 
the social spirit are eminently wanting ’.? In any case, 
however, the preparation for citizenship which we can 
give at school must be very imperfect. We cannot fully 
train boys and girls to take their places as men and 
women in society. If, therefore, the future men and 
women are to have a strong sense of their social and 
political responsibilities, the training begun in school 
must be continued by other educational agencies, such 
as the Church, social and political clubs, co-operative 
societies, continuation schools, and the Workers’ 
Educational Association.

  THE CONTENT OF THE SCHEME 43 
V. History is a united whole. We cannot isolate the 
history of England, but must teach something of men 
and movements in other lands, and the relations 
between our country and other nations. 
Some knowledge of general history is necessary, if 
only to aid us in comprehending the development of 
our own nation. England has not progressed by reason 
of indigenous forces alone. Her growth has been 
guided to a very great extent by influences from 
without. The early history of England is, indeed, 
largely the history of invasions. Each invasion has 
contributed something to the main stream of national 
life ; and we cannot ignore the sources whence these 
influences came. For example, to understand the 
effect of the introduction of Roman Christianity to 
England we must know something of its development 
before it reached these shores. Moreover, the teacher 
should constantly draw parallels between the history 
of England and of other countries. There are some 
movements more or less general, such as the barbarian 
invasions of the Roman Empire, the settlement of the 
Northmen in various parts of Europe, and the monastic 
revival of the tenth and eleventh centuries. If England 
participated in these movements, they must be taught, 
not as merely national movements, but as national 
examples of general movements. In this way the 
children will be getting broader and more intelligent 
views of English history. 
European history is of further value in interpreting 
current international affairs, with which we, as a nation, 
are concerned. The causes of the great war with 
Germany are only found in the history of the nineteenth 
century. The history of the alliances, the growth of 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Prussia, the development of German unity, the indus- 
trial and commercial expansion of Germany, the growth 
of a German colonial empire, the rise of German 
militarism, the growth of armaments ; these and many 
other topics must be studied if we are to understand 
the trend of events leading up to war. 
But though the study of European history has great 
value, the difficulties of teaching it systematically 
appear insuperable. Time is short, and the scheme of 
work, even for English history alone, will be a long one. 
A year or two spent in giving the children a cursory 
knowledge of the outlines of general history will be of 
little value, since we should only be able to teach 
a summary of events. And summaries are useless, 
except for revision. It seems impossible, then, except 
in secondary schools, to devote time to a scheme of 
work in European history. We can still, however, do 
much while teaching the story of national development. 
The coming of the Romans will be an opportunity for 
a brief description of the imperial power of Rome, some 
idea of which will have been gained already through 
the stories of earlier years. The English Conquest will 
lead us to speak more generally of the overthrow of 
the Roman Empire. The Danish Conquest will be 
a fitting place for us to describe the extensive settle- 
ments of the Northmen. In speaking of Tudor mari- 
time enterprise we shall necessarily introduce Columbus 
and those who followed him to America. In these and 
many other topics we shall find opportunities of teach- 
ing much foreign history. - 
If this work is only incidental, the children will never 
gain sufficient knowledge to appreciate current inter- 
national affairs. A very comprehensive scheme of 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
THE CONTENT OF THE SCHEME 45 
  European history is necessary if a schoolboy, even of 
sixteen or seventeen, is to understand the events lead- 
ing up to the war with Germany. In the elementary 
school it is quite impossible to attempt anything of 
this kind. But can we not arrange a simple course in 
elementary schools to introduce the children to the 
main characters of European history? By all means, if 
we remember that the course is a collection of historical 
stories and nothing more, and that the history of 
Europe cannot be taught in the form of simple stories. 
In some schools, both elementary and secondary, an 
attempt is made to teach the general history of Europe 
more fully by spending less time on the history of the 
nation. This would, of course, be admirable, if the 
children could, by so doing, gain a view of the gradual 
development of modern Europe instead of limiting 
their attention to their own country. If history is 
a unity, why not attempt to survey the whole of it? 
In practice, however, the attempt usually ends in 
failure. The field is so wide and so crowded with 
figures, the facts are so numerous and so bewildering 
in complexity, that little real history is learnt. Hither 
the children lose themselves in a maze of unintelligible 
generalizations, or the teacher is content to tell a string 
of stories about leading characters and events. At the 
same time the children fail to gain a really intelligent 
view of the development of their own nation. Careful 
detailed work extending over several years is necessary 
for us to understand how modern England has come 
to be what it is, and few schools can afford the time to 
take a separate course in general European history. 
VI. One other subject remains to be considered. 
We must decide what place, if any, local history shall
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
hold in the scheme. By ‘local’ history we mean local 
events, remains, historic buildings, traditions, and 
customs, and mere names, personal and geographical ; 
in fact, anything in a locality which can throw light 
upon national developments or events. Local history, 
if used properly, brings general history within the 
limits of the child’s experience, and so makes it more 
real. By uniting the locality with the nation, it shows 
the child that national history is not a mere abstraction. 
Although the help so afforded to an understanding 
of national history cannot be over-estimated, yet it is 
impossible, except in a few districts, as London and 
York, to devise a satisfactory course of lessons on 
local history alone. ‘By itself it would be too thin, 
too limited in scope, too trivial. It would fail in one 
of the prime objects of historical instruction, which 
is to enlarge the ltorizon of the mind, to widen the 
sympathies, to raise the growing interest of the child 
above the barriers of his own restricted life... . I would 
refuse to allow any separate hour to be assigned to it 
on the time-table, and would urge instead, that no hour 
in which history is taught should remain devoid of its 
presence and its influence.’ + 
Many attempts have been made to write school 
histories of various localities, but the records at the 
disposal of the writers are usually so sadly defective 
that the story becomes an account ofnational develop- 
ment, illustrated by the history of the locality, or it is 
a number of disconnected stories of local happenings 
which by themselves lack the educative value of the 
study of development.

CHAPTER, III 
THE FORM OF THE SCHEME 
Havine selected the material for the scheme, we must 
arrange it and consider what portions of the work can 
be taken in each succeeding year. A beginning is 
usually made with children six or seven years of age by 
telling them stories selected from the literature and 
folklore of various nations. This preliminary period 
generally lasts for two years. Then, because our work 
is centred round the development of the nation, the 
children in the third year restrict their attention more 
or less to their own country. No attempt is made in 
the third year to teach an outline of English history, 
the aims of the teacher being to arouse interest in some 
of the chief characters and events and to provide a 
foundation of facts which can be filled in as the study 
of history proceeds. 
So far there is a fair amount of unanimity amongst 
teachers. But in the fourth year the work becomes 
more systematic and detailed, and we are confronted 
witha serious problem of arrangement. Shallthe scheme 
for the upper part of the school be a periodic one, in 
which the whole of our national history is divided into 
three or four periods, one of which is studied in each 
year? Or shall we take the children through the 
whole field during each year, selecting those topics 
which are suited to the mental development of the 
class? It will probably be found that a scheme which —
-P-A-G-E-48
TN — re 
48 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
combines the advantages of both these methods of 
arrangement will give the best results. 
The concentric plan, consistently adhered to, has 
serious drawbacks. In one year it is impossible to 
study profitably topics selected from the whole period 
from the landing of Julius Caesar to the death of 
Edward VII.. There is a lack of concentration, a 
scattering of energy. The time is too short for the 
children either to get a vivid picture of the life of the 
nation at any one period or to trace the development 
of the nation during any one period or in any one 
direction. When a number of disconnected topics, 
differing greatly in character and ranging over the 
whole field of English history, are taught in one year, 
the children cannot get a real understanding of any of 
them. The settlement of the Pilgrim Fathers is an 
episode in the colonization of America and also in the 
struggle for religious liberty in England. It should 
thereforé be taken in one or both of these relations. 
The conflict between Montcalm and Wolfe is the climax 
in the struggle between France and England in America, 
and without an understanding of the earlier events 
in that struggle the final scene on the Heights of 
Abraham loses its significance. Still more foolish is 
it to attempt to teach in isolated lessons such topics 
as Magna Carta or the Dissolution of the Monasteries. 
Single events can only be properly understood when 
viewed in relation with other events. 
To remedy this defect of concentric schemes attempts 
are sometimes made to teach some particular phase 
of the development of England through the year. 
Thus in one year the social and industrial history is 
studied ; in another year, imperial history ; in a third,
-P-A-G-E-49
       
   THE FORM. OF THE SCHEME 49 
        
                                                          
                                     
          
     constitutional history. In some cases two years are 
spent on the social and industrial history. But this 
arrangement is hardly a remedy for the drawbacks of 
the usual concentric schemes, since it has, in practice, 
disadvantages as great. When such a scheme as this 
is adopted, the children do not get an adequate all- 
round knowledge of the development of England. 
If the work of the last three or four years is more or 
less limited to the social and industrial, imperial, and 
constitutional history of England, there will be no 
opportunity for the children to study as fully as they 
should some other phases of national history, e.g. 
the expansion of England as a world power, and the 
religious and intellectual development of the people. 
This plan, however, does to some extent remedy 
what is perhaps the greatest weakness of many con- 
centric schemes, viz. failure to arouse the children’s 
interest in the subject. The reasons for this failure - 
are not far to seek. Usually there is little opportunity 
for the intensive study of a topic. There are so many 
topics to be studied during the year that it is impossible 
to teach any one of them in a leisurely way, using 
sufficient detail to make the subject really interesting. 
The lack of interest is also in part the outcome of the 
children so often knowing the most interesting facts 
about the people and events being studied. This is 
especially apparent when the children are taught in 
succeeding years by different teachers. 
A strictly periodic scheme, on the other hand, has 
equal disadvantages. The children often leave school 
with little knowledge of the history of the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries. And there is no gradation 
in difficulty of the topics to be studied. Young children’ 
1977 ¢ D
-P-A-G-E-50
     
      50 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  may begin with an early period in which there are 
important topics now quite beyond their understanding. 
Yet such topics will never be studied unless the period 
is revised in an upper class. 
This question of the suitability of the subjects taught 
is of great importance. If we are to be successful in 
our teaching we must choose those topics which are 
most fitting for the children’s stage of mental develop- 
ment. For young children the teacher must select 
those incidents only which are picturesque and drama- 
tic. The plot must be simple, the characters single-— 
minded. The boy of seven or eight delights to hear 
stories of Alexander, of Hannibal, of Alaric. He will, 
in imagination, fight for the Greeks against the on- 
coming Persians and take sides with the German 
tribes against the legions of Varus. But he cannot 
compare and contrast, trace causes and effects, or 
review a whole period to discover general tendencies. 
Neither is he able to comprehend abstract principles. 
The story of the Peasants’ Revolt can be made vivid 
and picturesque for him, but he is not in the least 
concerned with the events leading up to it or with 
the socialistic principles of John Ball. 
But even these young children are able to connect 
events. For example, after the relations between 
the facts have been brought out in teaching they are 
able to recognize that the Barbarian invasions of the 
‘Empire led to the withdrawal of the Roman legions 
from Britain; that this led to more frequent attacks 
on Britain from the English on the Continent ; that the 
English invasions led to the extinction of Roman civiliza- 
tion, the depression of the British, and the establish- 
ment of a number of small barbarian states in Britain.  
-P-A-G-E-51
asi 
THE FORM OF THE SCHEME 51 
When the boy becomes nine or ten he still loves 
picturesque stories. But his range of historical vision 
is lengthening and he is better able to understand the 
interdependence of events. By means of simple com- 
parisons and generalizations made by himself under 
the teacher’s guidance, he is beginning the study of 
general movements. History is revealing itself to 
him more and more as a process of development. 
But he cannot understand abstractions. The teacher of 
a class of children nine and ten years old who took as 
the text of his lesson on Magna Carta the quotation 
“ Justice must not be denied, delayed or sold’, failed 
entirely to appreciate the mental content of his pupils. 
For older pupils, history should be further still 
a study of development. Boys and girls of thirteen 
and fourteen are capable of taking interest in the 
slow growth of national institutions. They are often 
able to trace causes and effects. They can sometimes 
perceive the inner meaning of historical events. To 
them the voyage of .Columbus in 1492 was not the 
isolated venture of an individual, but was representa- 
tive of a great world movement; one of many signs 
that men were finding new paths and throwing off old 
shackles. 
The scheme suggested below has been drawn up with 
‘these principles in mind. An attempt has been made 
‘to combine the advantages of the concentric and 
periodic methods. Because stories of early times and 
the age of Romance and Chivalry are attractive to 
children, the work of the fourth year is based upon 
certain features of the history of England from pre- 
historic times to the close of the Middle Ages. In the 
fifth year a selection is made of easier topics from 
D2
-P-A-G-E-52
   
     
52 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
modern English history, attention being devoted 
especially to the external expansion of England. In 
the sixth year the children study the more difficult 
parts of modern history, especially the intellectual, 
religious, and political development of England. 
Finally, in the last two years the development of 
industrial England is studied in detail from the middle 
of the eighteenth century and some attention given 
to the growth of the Constitution and the Empire. 
These suggestions in tabulated form are, then: 
First and Second Historical stories, legends and 
Years. myths. 
Third Year. Stories from British History. 
Fourth Year. History of England from early 
times to 1485.

Easier topics. 
Sixth Year. History of England from 1485. 
Harder topics. 
Seventhand Eighth Modern England and some con- 
Years. stitutional history. 
Whatever the form of scheme, however, history 
work in schools is necessarily very limited in scope. 
The pupils, even in a secondary school, often leave at 
an age when the greater part of history is still quite 
beyond their understanding. We, therefore, can only 
make a beginning in this study. But we cannot do 
more than this in other subjects, as Literature, Geo- 
graphy, Mathematics, Science or Art. These are all, 
in a sense, subjects for adults, and in teaching them to 
children we aim in nowise at completeness. ‘A com- 
plete survey of the main outlines of history’ is the
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE FORM OF THE SCHEME 53 
ignis fatuus leading teachers astray from the path 
of common sense in history teaching. We must resist 
the baleful influence of the text-book, which touches 
upon a thousand topics in a hundred pages, as if a 
complete review of the whole of our national story 
were possible. We must omit much in order that we 
may teach a little effectively. Although the detailed 
schemes given in the following chapters may appear 
ambitious for elementary schools and even for many 
secondary schools, they are offered merely as sugges- 
tions. They illustrate the importance of having a few 
main ideas worked out in detail and of regarding 
history as a study of development. It is hoped also 
they may help teachers in drawing up their own schemes 
of work. It is not intended that all the work suggested 
for one year should be attempted. Much depends 
upon the attainments of the class and the time available 
for history. 
We must beware, then, of attempting to cover as 
much ground as possible. The work should be restricted 
to certain topics, and even within these limits it should 
be intensive rather than extensive. For example, the 
value of the study of the Renaissance will not, of course, 
be in proportion to the number of events or men 
mentioned or the number of facts learnt. It will 
rather be in proportion to the understanding our 
pupils have of a great movement. The subject is 
naturally too difficult for boys of twelve or fourteen 
to understand thoroughly. But whether it is suitable 
or not depends to a great extent upon the material 
selected. One teacher can make the Renaissance a 
suitable subject for boys of twelve. In the hands of 
another it is unintelligible to boys of fourteen or

fifteen. If our pupils are to understand its real impor- 
tance, progress must be slow. We must give them 
a wealth of detail, which will bring home to them the 
fact which need, perhaps, never be stated in exact 
words, that men’s intellectual horizon was widening. 
Tt will be a new subject and we must lead them through 
this unknown country at a leisurely pace. If we hurry 
them on at express rate, they will only gain passing 
glimpses of features which are probably unimportant. 
To be in a hurry is fatal for successful work in history.

  CHAPTER IV 
HISTORICAL STORIES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN 
In the first three years the introductory work aims 
at giving the child a foundation of historical knowledge. 
The ideas which he gains from the stories told to the 
class are unorganized, since they have been acquired | 
more or less incidentally. But this is precisely the 
manner in which we all, throughout life, extend our 
knowledge. The growth of knowledge in the child is 
accompanied by the expansion of his imagination. 
He is taken beyond the little ‘ square mile or so’ which 
constitutes his world and makes acquaintance with 
people in other times. If the child vividly imagines 
the scenes described we may be certain that he will 
not remain indifferent in feeling towards the characters 
of the story. The young boy is a hero-worshipper and 
inevitably has his emotions aroused by the deeds of 
the heroes which his imagination makes so real to him. 
In this way the story is aiding the formation of ideals 
of conduct and so is contributing to the development 
of the child’s character and personality. 
But the results of the story-telling do not stop here. 
The growth of knowledge, the stirring of the imagina- 
tion, and the appeal to the emotions are accompanied 
by the development of a permanent interest in historical 
tales. When teachers in the upper part of the school 
fail to arouse interest in history, it is due to the 
fact that they have not continued the story-telling 
methods of the lower classes, but have troubled the 
children with the vague incomprehensible ideas of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
56 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  text-book. It is necessary to teach some abstract ideas 
and generalizations in the upper classes, but we must, 
wherever possible, prefer vivid narrative and concrete 
detail to abstractions. 
Historical stories told to young children can be 
conveniently divided into three classes : 
1. Stories which are true in fact, e.g. Leonidas at 
Thermopylae, the battle of Marathon, Caesar’s Invasion 
of Britain, the Adventures of Richard I of England. 
2. Legends, e.g. Romulus and Remus, the Geese 
in the Capitol, stories from the Arthurian and Charle- 
magne cycles, Robin Hood, the Green Knight, and other 
stories of early England. | 
3. Myths, e.g. stories of the gods and goddesses of 
Greece and Rome, stories from the Norse sagas. 
It is not easy, however, to make a clear distinction 
between these classes. Whether a tale is considered to 
be a mere legend or a true story often depends upon the 
credibility of our evidence, and we are often left in 
doubt. The story of Alfred and the Cakes may still be 
accepted by many as an historical story, although our 
evidence for it is so doubtful, that it is wise to consider 
it a legend. Legends have often originated as histori- 
cal facts. These have been expanded, often by the 
addition of the miraculous, until they bear their true 
character upon their face. 
Whilst legends have a germ of truth and are usually 
connected with an historical person or a particular 
place, myths have no historical foundation. They 
are often the attempts of primitive peoples to interpret 
the forces of nature and the spiritual growth of man. 
As legend is first cousin to history, so is mythology 
first cousin to religion.
-P-A-G-E-57
          HISTORICAL STORIES FOR CHILDREN 57 
   In the school the stories known to be historically 
true are of value in three ways : 
1. To teach historical facts which will form a founda- 
tion for later work. 
2. To give the correct historical atmosphere for 
the period of the story. 
3. To give a broad humanistic foundation for later 
work in History, Literature, and Geography. 
Legends, though containing many facts known to 
be untrue, are of value for the two latter reasons. 
Myths, which have often no distinctive historical 
element, are useful only as other non-historical stories 
are useful. 
In practice, however, legends are often as valuable 
as stories which are historically true. Ina way they are 
as true as historical stories, since the truth of a story 
can be regarded from two points of view. It may be 
accurate in its facts, inasmuch as those facts are fully 
supported by evidence. That is, we can say that such 
and such events did actually happen. Accuracy of 
this kind matters little to the young child. On the 
other hand, a story may be inaccurate in many details ; 
we may even doubt whether the events recounted did 
actually happen at all. Yet in the hands of a good 
teacher it may give a true picture of the spirit of the 
times and form a background for later work. The 
story of a Danish raid on the coast of France in the 
ninth century may contain many little incidents which 
originated in the fertile brain of the teacher. The raid, 
as recounted, may indeed be quite imaginary. But 
the story to be useful must breathe the spirit of the 
Norsemen. It must smell of the sea ; it must impress 
the children with the ruthlessness, the coarseness, the        
                                    
        
                                    
-P-A-G-E-58
         
        58 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
   
    
                                                               courage of the vikings. Such a story should make it 
easier for the children later on to understand the Danish 
conquest of England and the settlement of the Normans 
in France. Similarly, the story of the Venerable Bede 
is useful in giving a true picture of early monastic life. 
Historical stories, then, whether they be fact or 
legend, must be permeated by a truthfulness which 
is higher than mere accuracy of incidents. But a true 
atmosphere is hard to gain. In the historical story we 
must take some account of time and place if it is to 
preserve its historical character. Strip it of its setting, 
tell it without regard to time and circumstances: it 
may still be of value, but can no longer be ‘ historical’. 
But all teachers are aware that a child’s comprehension 
of time and geographical position is limited. We are 
inclined to pass lightly by the period and €xact locality 
of the exploits recounted. ‘ Once upon a time there 
lived’ is often regarded as an adequate introduction. 
Besides, a child’s ideas on most subjects are more 
limited than the teacher’s. He interprets the story in 
the light of his smaller knowledge, which is usually 
connected with his own locality and his own time. 
We may read an account of the battle of Marathon, 
and can picture the plain, the Persian fleet, the opposing 
armies, and the victory of the Greeks. To us it is 
realistic because the words, as we read them, call up 
a host of ideas which we already possess. We may have 
heard or read other accounts of the battle. We may 
have seen pictures of the plain, the Greek warriors, 
and the Persian fleet. We may have also seen specimens 
of Greek arms and armour in museums. Hence our 
mental pictures of the events are much clearer than 
those of the child. We can ‘localize’ the story and
-P-A-G-E-59
  HISTORICAL STORIES FOR CHILDREN 59 
place it in its proper setting; to us it is definitely 
Greek. But the child is deficient in ideas on this 
subject, and even a teacher who is at the same time a 
good story-teller and a student of Greek history finds 
it difficult to create the true atmosphere of the story. 
Almost inevitably it acquires a modern tinge. 
It is only when a child has been told a number of 
stories about a certain period or topic that he develops 
some understanding of those times. We must present 
the same background repeatedly and vary the figures 
on the stage. The story of the Venerable Bede by 
itself will not enable a child to realize the piety or 
learning of the early monks. We must tell him stories 
of other monks. He must hear of St. Columba, St. 
Aidan, St. Cuthbert, St. Aldhelm, and Ceedmon. The 
child will then realize the general truth, which he may 
not, however, be able to formulate, that the early monks 
were the teachers and preachers of their day. He will 
have a solid foundation for later work in the history of 
the Church; he will understand something of the 
condition of England in early Anglo-Saxon days ; 
and in his heart there will be a faint echo of the spirit 
which guided those early saints. It is this understand- 
ing of certain general truths and this feeling of sym- 
pathy that constitute the historical setting so important 
for the children to acquire. 
When possible, then, a story should not stand in 
isolation. It should be followed up by others dealing 
with the same topic. The effect of such teaching will 
be cumulative, each story adding something that fills 
out and strengthens ideas which the whole series is 
meant to emphasize. Let us take one further illustra- 
tion of this point. If we wish the children to know 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
60 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  something about the Danish invasions it is not sufficient 
to take one typical story such as Alfred and the Cakes. 
We can tell the story of the discovery of Greenland 
and America by the Norsemen, the viking attack on 
Paris, a typical Danish attack on the east coast of 
England, the battle of Ethandune, the battle of Brunan- 
burgh, and stories of the Danish conquest by Sweyn 
and Canute. 
The work during these three years must be graduated 
in character. At first the stories deal only with simple 
situations and characters. Though simple, they 
transport the child to scenes of wonder and romance 
and provide him with much incidental knowledge. 
The work gradually develops in several ways. 
1. The child is able to concentrate his attention for 
alonger period onatopic. The stories therefore increase 
in length and complexity. 
2. In the third year the stories become narrower 
in scope. The class will now be told a series of tales 
which will provide a skeleton outline of the whole of 
English History. We need not limit the child altogether 
to his own land. He will still be told stories connected 
only indirectly, if at all, with England, yet which will 
help him to understand the development of England. 
These stories in the third year should, whenever 
possible, be illustrative of more or less general move- 
ments or features of a period. The story of a battle 
such as Hastings, or Agincourt, or Flodden may rouse 
the children’s feelings, and interest them as an isolated 
event. But it is more than that. Such a battle is 
typical of similar battles of the same period and can 
be referred to in later teaching. St. Augustine’s 
mission to Kent is typical of the manner in which the
-P-A-G-E-61
  HISTORICAL STORIES FOR CHILDREN 61 
English were converted. The Peasants’ Revolt illus- 
trates the social conditions of the lower classes at that 
time. Richard I is typical of a mediaeval hero, Drake 
of the Elizabethan seamen, Cromwell of the stern 
Puritans. 
3. Further, if we are to emphasize the historical 
nature of the story and make it more and more a founda- 
tion for later work, we must modify our method of 
teaching. An attempt must be made to impress the 
events permanently on the child’s mind. This can be 
done by recapitulation, more expression work than is 
usually done at present, the keeping of simple note- 
books, and the more systematic use of the blackboard 
for recording names and events to be remembered. 
In some schools during part of this preliminary 
period the work is based upon life in primitive times 
and an attempt made to trace the development of 
early man. A beginning is sometimes made with some 
such homely topics as the house, clothing, food and 
fire. The children study the materials and sources 
of supply, and, working backwards, arrive at a time, 
very different from the present, when people were 
without shelter, tools, clothes, or regular supplies of 
food. The children then work out under the teacher’s 
guidance various problems, e.g. how a tribe could 
cross a wide river, or how they could hunt the swift 
deer. This work naturally requires a suitable environ- 
ment. The problems presented to the children are 
therefore determined to some extent by the locality 
of the school. 
Such a scheme has much to commend it. 
1. The children are greatly interested in the work. 
Opinion is divided as to the source of this interest.  
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Some, who believe in the culture-epoch theory, maintain 
that the child is naturally attracted towards the 
conditions of life in primitive times, because he himself 
is passing through stages of development corresponding 
to those passed through by the race in early times. 
Others, whilst rejecting the theory of historical stages, 
hold that life in early times, being simple, is more 
easily understood and hence more attractive to the 
child than the complex society of to-day. Others; 
again, consider that it is its remoteness which makes 
the story of early man so attractive to young children. 
It takes them far away from the present and gives 
scope for the play of their imagination. The true 
explanation of the child’s interest is perhaps. found in 
a combination of these opinions. 
2. Another advantage is the many opportunities 
for expression work, such as handwork of various kinds 
and dramatization. The children make models of 
caves in which the Cave-men dwelt, stone implements, 
often of clay, pottery of a primitive type, and similar 
articles. In imitation of early man they also attempt 
to devise simple methods of spinning and weaving. 
All this is very useful as handwork, but we may ask 
ourselves whether we could not find equally valuable 
exercises connected with man in historical times. 
3. Not only in the handwork but also in the discus- 
sions between teacher and class there will be many 
opportunities for the children to think out solutions 
of problems suggested to them. In this way the subject 
calls for continual effort from the children. It is the 
class and not the teacher who will do most of the work. 
4. Again, the children gain a more intelligent outlook 
upon some of the familiar features of modern life, e.g.
-P-A-G-E-63
  HISTORICAL STORIES FOR CHILDREN 63 
our clothes, the home, methods of obtaining and cooking 
food, and means of communication. The children, 
even at this early stage, will understand that the 
world was not always as it is to-day; that things 
gradually change. They will then be getting some 
idea of historical development. 
5. Lastly, early man lived in intimate touch with 
nature. The surface features of the land, the climate, 
vegetation and animal life of a region were vital 
influences in his life. The study of primitive conditions 
will therefore provide much incidental work in nature- 
study and physical geography, and help to break down 
the artificial division of the work of lower classes into 
water-tight compartments or subjects. 
These are points in favour of supplementing, but. 
not supplanting, the usual historical stories by the 
study of primitive social conditions.  
-P-A-G-E-64
CHAPTER V 
THE WORK OF THE FOURTH YEAR 
  In this year the children will study the origins and 
early growth of our national life. The English invaders 
of this land found a race inhabiting it which had, for 
four centuries, been in contact with the civilization of 
Rome. We must therefore begin in the traditional 
way with the Britons and study the course and influence 
of the various invasions, Roman, English, Danish, and 
Norman. We must show how the various invaders 
were absorbed in the growing nation, and how from 
a number of petty kingdoms one strong united state 
was gradually formed. 
The social and industrial condition of England in 
early times is also important. If the children are to 
understand the immense changes in these directions 
they must, in this and the following years, study the 
life of the people in different ages, and by comparisons 
mark the gradual evolution of modern conditions. 
The syllabus below indicates some suitable topics 
for study. A list of books is given at the end of the 
chapter. 
ENGLAND BEFORE THE CONQUEST OF 1066 
I. Prehistoric Inhabitants of Britain 
(a) The Cave-men; a description of their mode of 
living as shown by remains. 
(6) The Britons of the south at the time of the 
Roman invasions. 
A lesson could be given on each of these points, and
-P-A-G-E-65
  WORK OF THE FOURTH YEAR 65 
in a third lesson a comparison between them would 
emphasize the great development in prehistoric times 
in various directions : 
1. Improvements in conditions of living. Men had 
learnt how to build houses, make formidable weapons 
of bronze and iron, and weave cloth. Their existence 
was not so precarious, as they had also learnt to grow 
corn and collect wealth in the form of flocks and herds. 
2. Social changes. Society had passed from the 
family to the tribal stage. British remains to-day give 
evidence of co-operation, e.g. camps, such as the great 
Maiden Castle in Dorset; circles, such as Avebury 
and Stonehenge ; and roads. The great Roman roads 
are supposed in some cases to have been developments 
of older British roads. 
II. Romans in Britain 
(a) Great characters and events. 
1. The wars between Rome and the barbarians, 
invasion of Germany, and the defeat of Varus 
by Arminius, the German hero. The conquest 
of Gaul by Julius Caesar. j 
2. Invasions of Britain by Julius Caesar—Cassivel- 
launus. 
3. The conquest of the Britons—Caractacus. 
4. Boadicea. 
5. The work of Agricola—extracts from Tacitus. 
6. Emperor Severus in Britain. 
7. Constantius, Helena, and Constantine. 
(6) The work of the Romans in Britain. - 
1. Roads, towns, walls, camps, &c. Refer to 
remains, especially those in the vicinity of 
the school. 
1977 B
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
2. Government. Details of the Roman system are 
not necessary. 
3. Civilization. Description of Roman life, with 
reference to remains and contents of museums, 
e.g. the Roman museum at York or the 
British Museum. 
4. Spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire, 
Diocletian’s persecution. Roman Christianity] 
in Britain, evidences—remains of Roman 
churches, the story of St. Alban, the visit of 
St. Germanus to suppress heresy. 
(c) Why the Romans left Britain. 
The stories of Attila and the Huns and Alaric and 
the Goths can be told at this point to illustrate attacks 
on the Empire by the barbarians. Britain had been 
attacked for some time, but had to be abandoned in 
order that Rome might concentrate her strength. 
III. The English Invasions 
The sources for this period are by no means reliable, 
and even the main outlines of events cannot sometimes 
be definitely settled. For a critical account the teacher 
should read Oman’s England before the Norman Con- 
quest, chap. xi, pp. 207 et seq., and Hodgkin, History 
of England to 1066, chap. vi. 
It is impossible and unnecessary to give the children 
a connected account of the invasions. The following 
suggestions will, however, be useful in giving a general 
impression of the period. 
1. The story of St. Germanus, who, with his friend, 
Lupus, came to Britain in 429 to combat heresy. At 
this time there was an invasion of Picts and Saxons, 
and the Britons sent for Germanus, who had been
-P-A-G-E-67
WORK OF THE FOURTH YEAR 67 
  a mighty man of war in Armorica. The Hallelujah 
Victory (Oman, p. 196; Bede, Book I, chap. xx). 
2. The story of Vortigern and the invitation to 
Hengist and Horsa (Gildas and Nennius in Old English 
Chronicles). In this story, amongst much fiction, there 
may be a germ of truth. The introduction of the 
Saxons to aid the Britons led to them ravaging the 
greater part of Britain (see extract from Gildas in 
Oman, p. 199, which describes the rapid conquest). 
3. The Saxon Conquest was checked under the 
British hero, Ambrosius. The story of King Arthur 
(Oman, pp. 210-12; Hodgkin, pp. 104-5). Battle of 
Mount Badon. The children will be interested to read 
about Vortigern, Ambrosius, Hengist, Merlin, Uther 
Pendragon, and Arthur in the History of Geoffrey of 
Monmouth; but they must remember that these 
stories are only legends. — 
4. The foundation of the kingdoms. The teacher 
should read Oman, chap. xii, which will probably cor- 
rect many previous ideas. The details of the settlements 
should not be taught, the children only needing to know 
that during the sixth century a number of small king- 
doms were founded in South and East Britain. 
5. The character of the Conquest (Hodgkin, pp. 108- 
10; Green, Making of England, chap. iv). 3 
IV: Everyday Life of the Early English 
For the facts consult Green, Making of England, 
chap. iv, and Stopford Brooke, History of Early English 
Literature, vol. i, chap. ix, The Settlement in Poetry. 
This is the first of a series of descriptions of social 
England at various periods. It is impossible for 
a teacher to give a continuous comprehensive account 
B2
-P-A-G-E-68
68 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of English society from early times; at intervals 
therefore, a section of the syllabus is devoted to social 
history. 
V. Conversion of the English + 
1. Conversion of the Irish by St. Patrick ;? Irish 
missionaries in Scotland—Iona and the work 
of St. Columba. 
. Roman missionaries—St. Augustine and the con- 
version of Kent. 
. Paulinus and the conversion of Northumbria. 
. The work of Aidan and Cuthbert in Northumbria. 
. The Synod of Whitby. 
. Early monastic life. Stories of St. Hilda, Cedmon, 
and Bede. ; 
  VI. The Rise of Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex 
Many of the details usually found in text-books can 
be omitted and attention devoted to a few great 
persons and events, e.g. Edwin and Oswald of North- 
umbria, Offa of Mercia, Egbert of Wessex, Alcuin the 
Scholar. 
VII. Conquest of England by the Danes 
1, Exploits of the vikings abroad and in England up 
to 865 (Oman, chap. xx). The extent of their raids can 
be illustrated by reference to attacks on Ireland, Lisbon 
and Cadiz, Paris, Hamburg, Canterbury and London. 
2. The struggle in England, 865-78. The conquest 
of England began with the attack on Kent, 865. Then, 
next year, the Great Army appeared in East Anglia. 
Its ravages can be narrated in connected form by 
1 Flecker, British Church History to 1000 A.D. (Bell, 1s. 6d.). 
2 Bury, Life of St. Patrick.
-P-A-G-E-69
  WORK OF THE FOURTH YEAR 69 
racing its progress from East Anglia, where they 
lwintered, 866-7, to Northumbria, where York was 
plundered ; thence through Mercia back to East Anglia, 
where King Edmund met his death; thence to the 
Thames, where they began the conquest of Wessex. 
The details of the struggle in Wessex are confusing. 
The children’s attention should therefore be concen- 
rated on a few outstanding events, as the battle of 
‘Ashdown, Alfred’s retreat to Athelney (the story of 
lfred and St. Cuthbert; see Freeman’s Old English 
istory), the battle of Ethandune, and the Peace of 
Wedmore. 
Meantime the Danes had made themselves masters 
of Mercia and Bernicia, where they sacked Lindisfarne. 
'The story can be told at this point of the faithful monks 
who wandered for eight years with the body of St. Cuth- 
bert and the relics of Oswald and Aidan, which were 
ultimately deposited at Chester-le-Street and a century 
later were transferred to Durham. 
VIII. Alfred the Great 
The teacher must aim at showing the class the 
permanent benefits that Alfred conferred on England 
Bog. 
1. The significance of his victory over the Danes. 
2. To what extent did he develop the military or 
naval forces of England ? 
3. His encouragement of learning. 
4. His laws. 
IX. Life in England in the time of Alfred 
Suggestions for lessons on this subject are given at 
the end of Chapter IX. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
70 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
X. Further wars with the Danes 
The teacher can only attempt to give accounts of 
typical events such as: 
1. King Athelstan and the battle of Brunanburgh— 
illustrates the English offensive against the 
Danes (translation of the Anglo-Saxon poem 
in Freeman, Old English History; see also 
Tennyson’s ‘ Battle of Brunanburh’). 
. The fight of Earl Brihtnoth at Maldon (translation 
of the Anglo-Saxon poem on this battle in 
Freeman. See also C. M. Yonge, A Book of 
Golden Deeds, xvi, The Battle of the Blackwater). 
. The massacre of St. Brice’s Day. 
. The murder of Archbishop Alphege. 
. The story of the death of King Sweyn (Freeman). 
. The defeat and death of Edmund Ironside. 
XI. Canute, King of England 
1. His pilgrimage to Rome. 
. His conquest of Norway. 
3. His wise rule in England (Kendall, p. 35; Colby, 
p. 24). 
The story of the King on the seashore is undoubtedly 
a legend, but gives a true indication of his character. 
  bo 
XII. The Coming of the Normans 
1. The great earls of Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, 
and East Anglia. Under Edward the Con- 
fessor the kingdom appeared to be falling apart ; 
a strong man was needed to make England 
a united nation. 
2. Events leading up to the Conquest. Emphasis 
must be laid on the picturesque incidents,
-P-A-G-E-71

WORK OF THE FOURTH YEAR 71 
e.g. the victory of the Normans over the House of 
Godwin, the visit of William of Normandy, the 
story of the death of Earl Godwin (Freeman), 
Harold at the court of Duke William. 
. Battle of Stamford Bridge. 
. Battle of Hastings. 
XIII. The Normans rule in England 
. William’s coronation. 
. Revolts of the English. Ravaging of the North. 
Hereward the Wake. 
. How William rewarded his barons and kept them 
in check. 
. Revolts of the barons. Death of Waltheof. 
. Domesday Survey. 
From THE CONQUEST TO THE CLOSE OF THE 
Mippie Aczs 
Some of the most prominent features of this period 
Te: 
. The growth of a strong central government with 
a highly organized executive and judicature. 
. The development and decline of the Feudal System. 
. The beginnings of representative government. 
. England’s relations with France and Scotland. 
. The power of the Church. 
. The growth and organization of trade and industry. 
Rise of towns. 
. The gradual decline of the manorial system. 
. It was the age of chivalry, when coarseness and the 
rule of brute force were closely associated with 
ideals of conduct and religion. The Crusades 
were the outcome of this spirit. 
Much of this must, however, be omitted in this year.  
-P-A-G-E-72
  72 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Constitutional development is studied later; the 
Church in the Middle Ages can be studied in connexion 
with the Reformation ; the feudal system is mainly of 
antiquarian interest and can be either omitted or 
treated incidentally in speaking of William I. Eng- 
land’s foreign relations can be studied in part without 
attempting to trace the relations between England, 
France, and Scotland throughout this period. The 
social and industrial history (6 and 7 above) in the 
hands of a good teacher will be suitable, whilst the 
spirit of chivalry can be understood even by young 
children when exemplified by the wars with France or 
the Crusades. 
The following suggestions are based on the above 
principles. 
I. A Series of Exploits 
One or more of the following to be studied in detail : 
1. The Crusades. Adventures by land and sea. 
Descriptions of the armies and methods of 
warfare. 
2. King John and the Barons. 
3. The Wars of Edward I. 
4. The Hundred Years’ War. 
5. The Wars of the Roses. 
It will be worse than useless to teach the mere 
outlines of these struggles. The text-book must be 
discarded and fuller descriptions found in larger works 
and contemporary authorities. The familiar criticism 
that in history we should study the lives of the people 
and not the wars of kings, is specious, but unsound. 
The above topics are selected because 
1. They are stories introducing movement and 
picturesque detail, if taught aright.
-P-A-G-E-73
  WORK OF THE FOURTH YEAR 73 
2. The Middle Ages was a period when physical 
strength was respected, when the weakling and the 
scholar were often objects of contempt. Quarrels, 
both national and private, were settled by the sword. 
Force has been one of the greatest influences moulding 
the course of history, and we ought, therefore, to 
recount such tales. 
3. By means of these stories we can teach much 
incidental matter concerning the state of England, the 
dress and habits of the people, methods of warfare, &c. 
Development can often be traced in these respects if* 
the topics selected extend over a long period, e.g. from 
the Crusades to the Wars of the Roses. 
II. England in the Middle Ages 
In this subject the range of topics is so wide that 
each teacher must construct his own scheme. No 
systematic descriptions of the various phases of social 
and industrial life should be attempted, for children 
dislike long descriptions. Where possible the teacher 
should invent stories or adapt them from standard 
authors, as an attractive method of imparting the 
knowledge." 
The following are lamong the many interesting 
subjects which may be selected : 
. Life in a castle. 
. The education of a knight. 
. A knight-errant. 
. A tournament. 
. Life in a village. Changes since the time of Alfred. 
. Life in a town. oor

13. The Canterbury Pilgrims. 
14. Daily life in a monastery. The monastic revival 
of the tenth and eleventh centuries and the rise 
of new orders could be mentioned here. 
15. School life six hundred years ago. 
16. Superstitions of the people. Witchcraft, astrology, 
alchemy. 
17. Pastimes of the people. 
The teaching will be in the form of stories or simple 
descriptions. Full use can be made of local history by 
centring the story or description round some person, 
real or fictitious, or some place in the vicinity of the 
school. Occasionally a visit can be arranged to a place 
of historical interest in the neighbourhood. 
Books FOR THE TEACHER 
Besides the general works recommended in the Appendix, the 
following books dealing with this period will be found useful : 
1. For prehistoric and Roman times there are local works of great 
value for almost all parts of the British Isles. These can usually be 
consulted in reference libraries. The Victoria County Histories may 
be especially mentioned for England. An outline sketch of pre- 
historic Britain will be found in Fletcher’s Introductory History, 
vol. i (Murray, 5s.). Windle’s Remains of the Prehistoric Age in 
Britain (Methuen, 7s. 6d.) is excellent, and contains lists of local 
remains, which are, however, by no means complete. The same 
author’s earlier book, Life in Harly Britain (Nutt, 3s. 6d.), is also
-P-A-G-E-75
WORK OF THE FOURTH YEAR 75 
  useful. Elton’s Origins of English History, a standard work of value, 
contains much information on the state of the British tribes at the 
time of the Roman invasion. 
2. For the general history of the Anglo-Saxon period the best 
recent books are those by Oman (Methuen’s History) and Hodgkin 
(Longmans’ Political History). J. R. Green’s two works, The Making 
of England (2 vols., Macmillan, 4s, each), and The Conquest of England 
(2 vols., 4s. each) are standard histories of the period. C. R. L. 
Fletcher’s Introductory History of England, vol. i to 1485, has many 
good features. Freeman’s Old English History for Children (Dent, 1s.) 
contains much dull material, but is useful for its stories. These are 
republished in Legends of Early England (Horace Marshall, 9d.). 
8. Sources for Anglo-Saxon history. The chronicle of Gildas 
(sixth century), the earliest source, is contained in Old English 
Chronicles (Bell, 5s.). Bede’s Ecclesiastical History, the best authority 
for the seventh and early eighth centuries, is also of some value for 
the fifth and sixth centuries, since he may have had recourse to 
authorities which have been since lost. There are many interesting 
passages useful in teaching, e.g. Book V, chap. xxiii, for Abbess 
Hilda, and chap. xxiv for the story of Cedmon. For the story of 
the death of Bede, as told by one of his pupils, see the introduction 
to the edition by A. M. Sellar (Bell, 5s.), pp. xl-xliii. The Anglo- 
Saxon Chronicle, early times to 1154 (Bell, 5s.), is the best authority 
for the later Anglo-Saxon period. The chronicle of Nennius, a ninth- 
century edition of an earlier work by an unknown author, is useful 
to supplement Gildas and Bede for the period of the English inva- 
sions. The Rule of St. Benedict, useful in connexion with early 
monastic life, is translated in Henderson’s Select Historical Documents 
of the Middle Ages (Bell, 5s.). 
4. For the conquest of England by the Danes, general accounts 
are given in Oman, Green, and Hodgkin. For the vikings, the 
teacher should read Jewett, The Story of the Normans, chap. i (Stories 
of the Nations Series, 5s., Fisher Unwin); and Keary, The Vikings 
in Western Christendom, chap. v, Character of the Vikings; chaps. 
iv and xii, Norse attacks on England before Wedmore. For the 
reign of Alfred, Asser’s Life may be used (included in Old English 
Chronicles), but because of its unreliability and omissions must be 
supplemented by modern works such as the millenary volume edited 
by A. Bowker (out of print) and The Life and Times of Alfred the
-P-A-G-E-76
76 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Great, by C. Plummer (Clarendon Press, 5s.) For short accounts 
of Alfred’s work see Oman, chap. xxiii; Hodgkin, chap. xvii; and 
Green, Conquest of England, chap. iv. 
5. For the Norman Conquest Freeman’s great work should be 
consulted if possible, e.g. Harold at the Court of Duke William, 
vol. iii, chap. xii; Stamford Bridge, vol. iii, chap. xiv; Hastings, 
vol. iii, chap. xv. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gives only a brief 
summary of the events of the year 1066. Colby’s Extracts from the 
Sources of English History (Longmans, 6s.), p. 29, gives extracts 
from the Heimskringla Saga on Stamford Bridge; Oman, p. 640, 
may be consulted for a criticism of its value. 
6. For the general history of the period 1066-1485 the volumes in 
Longmans’ and Methuen’s Histories should be consulted. Fletcher, 
vol. i, gives a shorter account. For mediaeval warfare the teacher 
should refer to Oman’s History of the Art of War (Methuen, 10s. 6d.), 
which deals fully with Arms and Armour, Sieges and Fortifications. 
Illustrations are given from great battles and sieges. 
7. For the social history of the Middle Ages, there are many 
excellent books besides the general social and industrial histories 
mentioned in the Appendix. Among the most useful are the 
following : 
E. M. Tappan, In Feudal Times (Harrap, 5s.). 
Mary Bateson, Mediaeval England (Fisher Unwin, 5s.), 
F. W. Cornish, Chivalry (Allen, 4s. 6d.). 
F. P. Barnard, Companion to English History (Clarendon Press, 
8s. 6d.), contains chapters on Architecture, Art of War, Shipping, 
Costumes, Town Life and Country Life, Monasticism, Trade and 
Commerce. 
Jusserand, English Wayfaring Life in the Fourteenth Century 
(Fisher Unwin, 2s. 6d.). A classic for one phase of mediaeval life. 
Contains much interesting material about travellers of all kinds. 
E. L. Cutts, Scenes and Characters of the Middle Ages (Moring, 
(7s. 6d.), includes The Monks, Hermits and Recluses, Pilgrims, 
Secular Clergy, Minstrels, Knights, Merchants.

(Routledge, 6s.). 
A. Abram, Social Life in England in the Fifteenth Century (Rout- 
ledge, 3s. 6d.).

the literary work of the monks. 
A. Jessopp, The Coming of the Friars (Fisher Unwin, 3s. 6d.), 
especially the essays on the Friars, Village Life in Mediaeval England, 
and Daily Life in a Mediaeval Monastery. 
Chronicle of Jocelyn of Brakelond (translated in the King’s Classics,

CHAPTER VI 
  THE WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 
In the fifth and sixth years two main lines of develop- 
ment will be studied in tracing the growth of modern 
England. 
(a) External Expansion 
Towards the end of the fifteenth century a change 
was gradually passing over the politics of Europe. 
The claims of the Empire and the Papacy to supremacy 
in Europe had never been established and were now 
disappearing before the rise of the great modern 
powers, France, Spain, and England. In each of these 
states a strong government and a strong sense of 
nationality were being developed through various 
causes! This resulted in growing rivalry between 
France and Spain, and a long struggle for supremacy. 
In this international competition for power, England 
played an important réle and secured a decisive voice 
in the councils of Europe, which she has since main- 
tained. Territorial expansion on the Continent was 
out of the question, and England found another outlet 
for her energy by way of the sea. Two questions 
therefore arise : 
1. How did England secure and on what grounds did 
she maintain her position as a great European power ? 
2. What were the chief steps in the development 
of England’s maritime power ? 
These questions will be studied in the fifth year.

(Longmans, 2s, 6d.).
-P-A-G-E-79
  WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 79 
(b) Intellectual, Religious, and Political Development 
In the latter part of the fifteenth century Europe was 
throwing off the shackles of the Middle Ages : society 
was emerging from the age of Authority to the age of 
Freedom. For many centuries the mind of Europe 
had been comparatively unprogressive. Much mental 
activity had had very insignificant results, and men’s 
intellectual horizon had remained narrow, until the 
Renaissance revealed new worlds to be explored. 
Man was then led to think and act as an individual, 
guided not by the dictates of tradition and authority 
but by his own mind and will. The Renaissance, 
then, was a great step forward towards intellectual 
liberty and power, and the way was prepared for the 
somewhat later revolt against the authority of the 
Church. In the Middle Ages the Church had been 
universal ; freedom of conscience had been unknown, 
and heresy had been severely repressed. The Reforma- 
tion was a tremendous upheaval against this uni- 
formity in religion. With growing individualism men 
claimed the right to hold whatever religious beliefs 
they wished, and although religious freedom was not 
secured in the sixteenth century there has been since 
that time a steady movement in this direction. 
With intellectual expansion and growing liberty of 
thought in religious matters it was only natural that 
the demand should arise for greater political liberty. 
In England the main lines of our modern constitutional 
government were settled before the end of the seven- 
teenth century, although in some countries of Europe 
this movement was deferred until much later.
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
The intellectual, religious and political development 
of England will be the subject for the sixth year. 
Detailed suggestions follow for the fifth year : 
I. Expansion or ENGLISH Power, 1485-1689 
A. Maritime, Commercial, and Colonial Expansion 
1. Voyages of Discovery and Exploration. 
(a) Development ofthe science ofnavigation. Prince 
Henry the Navigator. 
(b) The voyages of Columbus and the Cabots. 
(c) The great explorers of the sixteenth century, 
Magellan, Drake, Frobisher, Gilbert, Raleigh, 
Davis, and Hudson. The voyages of these 
seamen should be told to the class in detail, e.g. 
several lessons can be given on Drake alone, 
in which his voyage to Central America, 1572-3, 
and his voyage round the world, 1577-80, will 
illustrate the adventurous spirit of the Eliza- 
bethan seamen, the motives for their voyages, 
and the many differences between these voyages 
in the sixteenth century and sea voyages to-day. 
(d) Portuguese explorations inthe East. Bartholo- 
‘mew Diaz and Vasco da Gama, Portuguese 
settlementsin Africa, India, and the East Indies. 
The voyages of discovery were followed by com- 
mercial and colonial expansion. 
2. Commercial expansion. 
(a) English commerce in the Middle Ages. 
(b) Development of commerce in Tudor times. After 
the sack of Antwerp, 1576, London began to take 
its place as the emporium of Western Europe. 
(c) Hawkins and the slave trade. 
(d) Commerce in Stuart times. Further expansion— 
trade carried on by means of companies—the
-P-A-G-E-81
  WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 81 
East India Company—commercial supremacy of 
the Dutch at the beginning of the severiteenth 
century—settlements of the Dutch East India 
Company in the East Indies—commercial 
rivalry between Dutch and English in the East— 
Navigation Laws of the seventeenth century— 
their purpose. English commercial expansion 
was in part the cause of wars with Holland 
and Spain. These will be studied later. 
3. Colonial expansion. 
A contrast can be made between the colonial policy 
of Spain, France, and England in America, 
(a) Spain—motive, desire for wealth. Stories can 
be selected from Prescott’s Conquest of Mexico 
and Conquest of Peru. 
(6) France—motives, conversion of the heathen (by 
Jesuits) and desire for power (under Louis XIV). 
The class must study the settlements of the 
French in North America in the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries if they are to understand. 
the struggle with England in the eighteenth 
century. Extracts from the works of Fiske and 
Parkman will be useful. 
(c) England—various motives. The colonizing ven- 
tures of Gilbert and Raleigh, the settlement of 
New England and the southern colonies will be 
studied. 
B. Development of Political Power 
During this period, 1485-1689, England attained 
her position as a leading state in Europe chiefly by 
diplomacy and naval power. Her military campaigns 
on the Continent were usually of little importance. 
1977 r =
-P-A-G-E-82
82 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Examples: 
1. Henry VII's relations with Europe. At the beginning 
of his reign England was isolated, but at the 
end she had a place in the councils of Europe 
second to none and was courted on every side 
(Stubbs, Lectures on Mediaeval and Modern 
History, Lecture XVI). This was achieved by 
diplomacy. England was too poor, and Henry 
too wise, to waste money in foreign wars. 
Henry’s success in raising the prestige of England 
can be illustrated by his marriage alliances. 
2. Foreign affairs under Henry VIII and Wolsey. 
It is impossible to lead children through the maze 
of international diplomacy, but the following topics 
can be studied in class: 
(a) The growth of the navy. 
(6) War of 1512-13, which, though apparently 
successful, accomplished no permanent results 
of benefit to England. 
(c) Efforts of the Emperor Charles and King Francis 
to obtain the support of England in their 
rivalry for power. 
May 1520. Charles visits Henry at Canterbury. 
June 1520. Francis and Henry at the Field of 
the Cloth of Gold. 
July 1520. Charles and Henry at Gravelines. 
_ Wolsey’s aim was to make England the arbiter 
of Europe. 
(d) Henry’s vain attempts to conquer France ; 1522, 
Invasion of France by Earl of Surrey ; 1523, 
Invasion by Duke of Suffolk. Both invasions 
were quite futile. 
3. Reign of Elizabeth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 83 
The Queen’s diplomatic skill is shown throughout 
her reign in her relations with France, Scotland, the 
Netherlands, and Spain. Also, through her minister 
Burleigh, she continued her father’s policy of encour- 
aging the growth of the navy. The following topics 
are suitable for study : 
(a) Relations of Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots. 
It was in the interests of Elizabeth to encourage 
the nationalists in Scotland against the French 
party. Yet she had no desire for open war 
either with Mary’s party in Scotland or with 
France. Her interference in Scottish affairs 
was therefore usually carried out secretly. 
Her diplomatic methods are well illustrated 
by such episodes as her reception of the Earl 
of Murray. After Mary’s marriage with Darnley, 
Murray and other Protestant lords were in 
almost open rebellion. Elizabeth was privately 
sending money to Murray to encourage him ; 
but, avoiding battle, he proceeded to Elizabeth’s 
court, where she roundly declared she would 
never help rebels against their lawful sovereign. 
Yet Murray had written to Cecil that he ‘ would 
never have enterprised the action but that he 
had been moved thereto by the Queen ’. 
(0) Elizabeth’s attitude towards the Netherlands. 
Elizabeth refrained from giving open help to 
the Protestants, but allowed her subjects to 
give active support against Spain. When an 
English expedition was sent under Leicester, 
it proved its incapacity to give effective assis- 
tance to the Netherlanders. (The victory of 
Zutphen was barren of results.) 
F2 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
84 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(c) Elizabeth’s courtship of the Duke of Alengon, who 
became later Duke of Anjou. The negotiations 
continued for ten years (1572-82), during which 
time the friendship of France was secured. 
Elizabeth’s aims were shown’ in 1581, when 
Anjou came over a third time to press his suit. 
She demanded that Henry ITI should break with 
Philip, abandon Scotland, maintain war in the 
Netherlands against Spain at his own expense, 
and surrender Calais and Havre as guarantees 
that he would keep his word. 
(d) Naval war with Spain. Refer to Drake’s exiioita 
in America, and deal fully with the coming of 
the Armada and the causes of its defeat. 
4. Stuart times. 
(a) James and the Thirty Years’ War. Frederick 
and Elizabeth, the ‘ Winter King and Queen’ 
of Bohemia—their misfortunes—England’s in- 
effective help—Mansfeld’s expedition of 1624. 
(b) The navy during the Commonwealth and Pro- 
tectorate. Cromwell had foresight enough to 
see that England’s destiny lay towards the ocean. 
Thus under him the navy was developed. The 
wars with Holland and Spain were naval wars 
waged to establish the maritime and commercial 
supremacy of England. The successes in these 
wars greatly raised our prestige in Europe. 
Some of the most interesting topics are: 
Penn and Venables in the West Indies, Blake 
and the pirates of Algiers and Tunis, his attack 
on the Spanish treasure-ships off Cadiz and his 
attack on the galleons in the harbour of Santa 
Cruz.
-P-A-G-E-85
  WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 85 
(c) Foreign relations of Charles II and James II. 
The general feature of this period was a loss of 
prestige abroad. The chief events illustrating 
this were the Second Dutch War (capture of 
New Amsterdam, victory off Lowestoft, Dutch 
in the Medway), the secret Treaties of Dover, 
by which Charles made England subservient 
to the interests of France, and the Third Dutch 
War, into which England was led by Louis XIV 
for his own advantage. It was in this war that 
William III of Orange began his lifelong struggle 
with Louis by placing himself at the head of the 
Dutch and driving the French from his country. 
II. Tae StrRvuGGLE witH FRANCE, 1689-1763 
In this period the chief features of England’s foreign 
power are: 
(a) A further development of naval power. 
(b) The establishment of British supremacy in America 
and India, due to a great extent to command of 
the sea. 
(c) England takes a more active part in the conti- 
nental wars. The high diplomacy of the Tudors 
and the petty intrigues of the Stuarts abroad 
give place to the arbitrament of the sword. 
The struggle did not end in 1763, but was continued 
with intermissions fora half-century longer. ‘The whole 
period stands out as an age of gigantic rivalry between 
England and France, a kind of second Hundred Years’ 
War.’' The main causes of this struggle with France 
were twofold : 
1. Determination of England to prevent France 
1 Seeley, Expansion of England, p. 28.  
-P-A-G-E-86
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  becoming too powerful on the Continent. 
England’s intervention in continental affairs 
was usually the outcome of her desire to preserve 
the balance of power. 
2. Rivalry in America and India. This long struggle 
with France was, from one point of view, a 
struggle for Empire. France and England were 
candidates for the possession of the New World 
and a dominating position in India. 
The following phases of the struggle are 
suitable for study : 
1. William III's war with France. 
(a) Reasons for the war. 
(b) Episodes of the war, e.g. defeat of the French 
fleet off La Hogue ; loss of the Smyrna fleet ; 
failure of the British attack on Brest, owing to 
Marlborough’s treachery ; William’s campaign 
in the Netherlands, which served as the appren- 
ticeship of the English standing army. 
The peace of 1697 was only temporary, and 
hostilities were renewed in a few years. 
2. The War of the Spanish Succession. 
(a) England’s interest in the question. The aim of 
England was to check the overweening ambition 
of Louis XIV for supremacy on the Continent. 
This was the great lesson that William III 
taught the English people. The details of the 
Partition Treaties need not be studied, but the 
danger of the union of the crowns of France 
and Spain should be emphasized. 
(6) Marlborough’s campaigns. His victories estab- 
lished the reputation of England as a military 
power. 
   
-P-A-G-E-87
  WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 87 
(c) The naval war. Capture of Gibraltar and Minorca. 
3. War of Austrian Succession and Seven Years’ War. 
Hostility between France and England was only 
one aspect of these wars, but for our purpose the most 
important one. 
(a) Episodes from the wars on the Continent can be 
selected, e.g. Dettingen, Fontenoy, and Minden, 
without attempting a connected narrative of 
events. 
(6) The naval war. Exploits of Anson, Rodney, 
Hawke, Boscawen, Howe, and other leaders. 
It was to some extent because of our maritime 
supremacy that the French were defeated in 
India and America. 
4, Struggle between French and English in India. 
(a) First phase, 1741-8. Loss of English prestige 
owing to Dupleix’s intrigues with the natives 
and the success of the French troops and fleet. 
(b) Second phase, 1748-58, Interference of British 
and French in native politics. Exploits of Clive 
in the Carnatic. 
(c) Third phase, 1758-61. Final defeat of the French. 
5. Struggle in North America. 7 
Growing jealousy between English and French in 
the seventeenth century developed in the eighteenth 
century into intermittent warfare. The following 
periods in this struggle are suitable for study: 1689- 
1718, 1744-54, 1754-60. An interesting topic, and one 
which has important bearings on the struggle, is the 
story of French explorations and settlements in North 
America in the eighteenth century. 
In all the above sections, 1-5, the teacher must 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
88 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
aim at selecting a number of important episodes and 
dealing with them fully. 
6. The work of Pitt as a war minister and empire 
builder. 
  III. Loss or tHE AMERICAN COLONIES 
1. Events and Conditions leading up to War. 
(a) Revision of the growth of the British colonies 
in America to 1763. The contrast between 
North and South (New England and Virginia). 
(6) Colonial policy of Great Britain. Acts of various 
dates imposed restrictions on the commerce 
and manufactures of the colonies ; purpose of 
these restrictions ; prevalence of smuggling. 
(c) Question of taxation. Stamp Act, Declaration 
Act, Revenue Act of 1767. Reasons why these 
acts were resisted, especially in New England. 
(d) Attempts to overawe Massachusetts, the centre 
of disaffection, led to greater resistance to 
England. Boston massacre; incident of the 
Gaspee ; publication of Governor. Hutchinson’s 
letters ; Boston tea riot; penal laws against 
Massachusetts ; Quebec Act ; Continental Con- 
gress (September 1774). 
2. The War of Independence. 
(a) Growth of unity between the colonies leading 
up to Declaration of Independence. 
(6) Strength and weakness of the colonies. 
(c) The war on land. A summary of events is of 
little value. It is far better for the children to 
study one or two campaigns in some detail, 
in order to appreciate the connexion between 
events and the relation between geographical
-P-A-G-E-89
  WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 89 
features and military operations, e.g. the inva- 
sion of Canada ; Burgoyne’s attempt to advance 
from Canada ; Cornwallis in the south. 
(d) Influence of sea-power upon warfare on land. 
This can be studied as a separate topic or 
incidentally in connexion with the campaigns. 
(e) France and Spain join America. Reasons for 
France and Spain joining the colonists ; impor- 
tance of this help in turning the course of the 
war; the naval war, especially the exploits 
of Rodney. 
The class cannot at this point get an understanding 
of the effects of the loss of the colonies. This can only 
come with the further study of history, e.g. the effect 
of the migration of the United Empire loyalists to 
Canada, and the continued hostility of the Americans 
to England, which was shown in the war of 1812, can 
be best considered in dealing with the history of Canada. 
IV. Tun Frencu REevoLvtTion anD THE GREAT WAR 
1. State of France immediately before the Revolution. 
It is impossible to give the children a full account 
of the causes of the Revolution, but they can understand 
the downtrodden state of the lower orders, and the 
indifference of the Government. Such matters as the 
seignorial system, the heavy taxation, and the state 
of the court of Louis XVI can be taught successfully. 
When studying the social state of France compari- 
sons can be made with England in the Middle Ages. 
2. Establishment of the Republic. 
Many of the political details can be omitted and 
attention concentrated on a few great events, e.g.
-P-A-G-E-90
    90 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the summoning of the Estates-General; the fall of 
the Bastille; Versailles attacked by the Paris mob ; 
the flight to Varennes; the sack of the Tuileries; 
the September massacres; the execution of the 
king; the Reign of Terror and supremacy of the 
Jacobins. 
3. The Great War. 
Selected topics only can be studied, such as : 
(a) The naval war. The great sea-fights against 
France and Spain will provide material for 
several lessons. 
(b) Napoleon’s campaigns against Austria, Prussia, 
and Russia (1805-7), which left England to 
continue the struggle against Napoleon alone. 
Every boy and girl should know what Europe 
owed to England at this time. 
(c) The Peninsular War. Important events as 
Corunna, Torres Vedras, Salamanca, and Vit- 
toria. 
(d) Napoleon’s invasion of Russia—contrasted with 
German invasion of 1915. 
(e) The campaign of Waterloo. 
The end of the Napoleonic drama is a convenient 
point at which to bring the year’s work to a close. In 
some periods, as the reign of Elizabeth, only a trained 
mature mind can comprehend the trend of affairs ; 
whilst in every period many important events must be 
ignored in order that those selected may be taught 
in detail. The work outlined for this year will be 
condemned by those who hold that political history is 
of little importance for purposes of teaching in schools. 
The selection of these topics will be vindicated if the 
teacher wisely selects his material and by interesting
-P-A-G-E-91

narratives makes clear the way by which England 
reached and has developed her position as‘a European 
power. 
British expansion in the nineteenth century will be 
studied in the seventh and eighth years.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE SIXTH YEAR. INTERNAL DEVELOP- 
MENT OF ENGLAND 
I. Socran anp InpustRiaL ConDITIONS 
TuE aim of this section is to continue the social 
history of the Fourth Year by giving the class an 
account of life in England in the reign of Elizabeth, the 
most eventful epoch before the nineteenth century, 
and in the eighteenth. century on the eve of the In- 
dustrial Revolution. Then by means of contrasts the 
children will understand the social and economic pro- 
gress in the intervening period, and will be prepared 
to study in the next year the more rapid progress in 
the latter part of the eighteenth and in the nineteenth 
century. They will study the life of rich and poor in 
town and country, their work and amusements, the 
conditions of living and modes of travelling in each of 
these periods. The subject is very wide, and the mode 
of treatment depends largely upon the teacher’s know- 
ledge and the accessibility of books. It is therefore 
impossible to draw up a detailed scheme of work, but 
the following suggestions may be useful : 
A. The time of Elizabeth. 
1. A series of lessons can be given on life in a town, as 
London, York, Norwich, or Bristol. By studying the 
daily life of a typical inhabitant as a merchant or an 
artisan, facts can be introduced in an incidental way 
concerning the homes of the people, their mode of 
living, industries, trade, the government of the town,
-P-A-G-E-96
  96. THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the decline of the gilds, the maintenance of order, 
recreations of the people, &c. The published records 
and local histories of most of the ancient towns of 
England supply abundant material if used in conjunc- 
tion with more general sources of information. 
2. Life in a village. 
3. A journey from London to York. 
4. Pauperism and the relief of the poor—a topic 
which, though apparently unattractive to children, can 
be made interesting. 
B. The Eighteenth Century. 
1. Life in London. 
2. Life of a country squire and a yeoman farmer. 
8. Agriculture at the beginning of the eighteenth 
century. 
4. The domestic system of manufacture. 
5. The relief of the poor. 
6. Means of communication. 
7. Foreign commerce, e.g. main lines of trade, types 
of vessels, articles of trade, dangers of sea-voyages. 
Such information can be imparted by means of stories 
of adventure. 
8. Crime and punishments. 
9. A local topic, e.g. Leeds in the eighteenth century. 
These lists can be greatly extended by a teacher 
conversant with suitable books on the subject. Most 
of the work must be in the form of oral teaching, but 
occasionally, if books are available, individual children 
or a group may be set to study easy topics by them- 
selves, and publish the results of their work to the 
class in short papers. 
When studying the social history of the eighteenth 
century the children must make constant comparisons
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE SIXTH YEAR 97 
with the time of Elizabeth and the present time. 
These comparisons can usually be made by the children 
in the course of the lesson, but occasionally; as a 
revision exercise, the children can be required to 
answer such questions as the following : 
1. Contrast the methods of relieving poverty in the 
eighteenth century with those existing in the time of 
Elizabeth. 
2. Give a brief description of the growth of England’s 
foreign trade between the reign of Elizabeth and 1750. 
3. What were the principal changes in the manu- 
factures of England during the same period ? 
4. In what directions was little or no improvement 
made in the life of the people in the same period ? 
5. What are the chief improvements in means of 
communication since 1750 ? 
6. Can you apply the phrase ‘the good old times’ 
to life in England in the eighteenth century ? 
If. Iyrectecruat DEVELOPMENT 
A. State of learning in the Middle Ages. 
1. Schools—subjects of study. 
2. Hindrances to the spread of learning—lack of 
books before introduction of printing; difficulties 
of travel, preventing interchange of ideas—compare 
remote districts to-day ; low intellectual standard of 
the clergy and monks, who had a monopoly of book- 
learning ; supremacy of the strong arm—contempt for 
book-learning shown by the upper classes, whose educa- 
tion was mainly physical. 
These ideas can only be understood by the children 
when presented to them through particular examples. 
Many of the facts will have been already learnt in 
1977 Ges
-P-A-G-E-98
98 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
studying the social state of England in the Middle 
Ages. 
B. The Renaissance. 
It is impossible to deal Santiailiny with this subject, 
but even children can understand some of its most 
characteristic features, e.g. : 
1. The renewed study of Greek and Latin classics. 
2. The invention of printing. 
3. The life of Erasmus the Scholar. 
Suggestions for lessons on these subjects are given in 
Chapter IX. 
C. Intellectual development since the Renaissance. 
This is an exceedingly wide subject. It is not the 
achievements of its great thinkers, poets, dramatists, 
or scientists which indicate the intellectual progress of 
a nation. Surer guides are the growth of education, 
the decline of popular superstitions, and the develop- 
ment of true self-government. 
1. The growth of education. Little real progress 
was made until the nineteenth century. Contrasts can 
be drawn between the schools of the eighteenth century 
and those of to-day. 
2. The decline of superstitions. Something has 
already been learnt in the Fourth Year about the 
superstitions of the Middle Ages. Instances can now 
be given of superstitions in more recent times, e.g. an 
account of the trial of the Lancashire witches (1612)," 
and ‘A Discourse relating to a Strange and Monstrous 
Serpent or Dragon’ (1614).2 Sir W. Scott’s Letters on 
Demonology and Witchcraft can also be consulted by the 
teacher for examples, especially Letters vii—x.

.
-P-A-G-E-99
THE SIXTH YEAR 99 
Even at the present day superstitious beliefs continue 
to exist in backward parts of the country or did exist 
until the latter part of the nineteenth century. Local 
works on folklore will supply numerous examples, e.g. 
Rev. J. C. Atkinson, Forty Years in a Moorland Parish 
(Danby in Cleveland), and The Norfolk Garland and 
The Suffolk Garland. 
3. The growth of self-government. This will be 
studied later. 
III. Grows or Retieious Liperry 
A, Contrast between Middle Ages and Modern Times. 
1. Supremacy of Rome. Ever since the time of 
William I there had been resistance in England to the 
authority of Rome, e. g. William I’s enactments con- 
cerning the Church, and the Statutes of Praemunire 
and Provisors. 
2. Offences of the clergy were tried in special 
Church Courts. Benefit of clergy. The quarrel between 
Becket and Henry IT. 
3. Monasticism was universal, but from the thir- 
teenth to the sixteenth century the monasteries were 
steadily declining in power. 
4. People were outwardly more religious than in 
modern times (see Gasquet, Eve of the Reformation, 
chap. x, Parish Life in Catholic England). 
5. No liberty of conscience. Heresy of Wyclif and 
the Lollards. Huss. 
These five general facts cannot be taught except by 
means of particular examples. First, the study of 
illustrative topics, then the consideration of the general 
idea: this is the order in which the work must proceed.

B. The Reformation. 
1. Condition of the Church before the Reformation. | 
2. Reformation in Germany. Luther. 
3. Attempted reforms in England before the breach 
with Rome. The Oxford Reformers. Wolsey as a 
Reformer. 
4. Breach between Henry VIII and the Pope. The 
Divorce Question. The work of the Reformation Par- 
liament, 1529-36. 
. Dissolution of the Monasteries. 
. Introduction of the English Bible and Prayer Book. 
. The desecration of shrines and images. 
. The Marian Persecution. 
. Elizabeth’s Religious Settlement—a compromise. 
General Conclusion—The Reformation in England 
did not bring religious liberty as an immediate effect. 
C. The Rise of the Puritans. 
1. Growth of Puritanism within the Church. 
2. Formation of religious communities without the 
Church. 
D. Religious Struggle in the Seventeenth Century. 
1. Puritans and Catholics in the reign of James. 
Hampton Court Conference. Gunpowder Plot. 
2. Attempt by Charles and Laud to establish High 
Church uniformity : 
(a) In England—misuse of arbitrary courts. 
(8) In Scotland—attempt to introduce Episcopacy 
led to the National Covenant and the Bishops’ 
Wars. The trouble with Scotland ultimately 
resulted in the calling of the Long Parliament. 
3. The religious struggle, 1640-60. The details are 
tedious, but the class should know something of the 
attack on the Church of England by the intolerant worn a o 
 
-P-A-G-E-101

Parliament, and Cromwell’s more tolerant attitude in 
religious matters during the Protectorate. 
4. Attack on Puritanism in the reign of Charles IT. 
Clarendon Code. 
5. Attempt to establish Roman Catholicism in the 
reigns of Charles II and James II. 
E. Removal of Religious Disabilities. 
This was carried out by a long series of Acts, be- 
ginning in 1689 (Toleration Act) and ending in 1871 
with the abolition of religious tests at Oxford and 
Cambridge. 
F. Rise of the Methodists. 
IV. Growts or Porrrican LipeRTY 
The teacher’s aim in this section is not to attempt 
the impossible task of giving his pupils a clear con- 
ception of ‘ political liberty’. He will, indeed, avoid 
the phrase altogether, since it can have little meaning 
except to the oldest pupils who have already studied 
how those liberties have been evolved through the 
centuries of our history. His aim is rather to give some 
fundamental ideas which can be extended later, when 
) studying the development of constitutional government. 
A. In the Middle Ages. 
Here, as everywhere, general ideas should only be 
approached through particular facts. A beginning can 
be made by the teacher giving lessons on the following 
topics : 
1. The Charter of. Liberties, 1100. This will involve 
some account of the abuses of William IT’s reign. 
2. The struggle between John and the barons. 
Magna Carta. The Civil War. 
3. Simon de Montfort’s Rebellion.
-P-A-G-E-102
  102 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
4. The fall of Richard II and the foundation of the 
Lancastrian dynasty. 
5. The Wars of the Roses—studied as a revolt 
against inefficient government. The foundation of the 
Tudor dynasty. 
By the study of these and similar events, several 
important facts can be illustrated : 
1. In the Middle Ages the king was the real ruler of 
England and had a far greater share in the work of 
government than at present. His power, however, was 
limited by the rights of his subjects. All classes, 
barons, clergy, and commons, during the Middle Ages 
were gradually acquiring liberties which protected 
them against royal despotism. 
The children will have become acquainted with the 
people’s rights when studying Magna Carta, which 
was many times confirmed, and the revolts against in- 
efficient government, e.g. in the reigns of Henry III, 
Richard II, and Henry VI. 
Amongst other things the people had a right to expect 
from the king: 
(a) Efficient administration of justice. 
(6) Maintenance of internal peace. Security for 
person and property and. protection for internal 
trade. 
(c) Wise expenditure of revenue of the Crown. In 
quiet times the king was expected to ‘live on 
his own’. A description of how he did this 
can be made interesting for children. 
2. Disputes often arose between king and people 
when he failed to govern satisfactorily. Both barons 
and commons then considered they had a right to 
interfere. Their opposition could be shown:
-P-A-G-E-103
    
THE SIXTH YEAR 103 
(a) By open revolt. The king might hire mercenaries, 
but could not resist his barons. When the 
revolt was not led by the barons it usually came 
to naught, e.g. Peasants’ Revolt. The reason 
for this is obvious. 
(b) In Parliament, e.g.,.Mad Parliament, 1258; Good 
Parliament, 1376 ; and the Merciless Parliament, 
1388. The strength of Parliament was not only 
found in it being a centre of organized resis- 
tance, and a means by which the king’s govern- 
ment could be systematically criticized and 
restrained ; Parliament more than once elected 
the king (e.g. Henry IV and Henry VII), and 
in the fifteenth SPRY, gained control of the 
national revenue. 
To sum up, in the Middle Ages the power of govern- 
ment was mainly, but not wholly, in the hands of the 
king and his nobles. Our aim now is to show how the 
people obtained the leading share in the government 
of England. 
B. The Tudor Period. 
This epoch is characterized by a strong personal 
government. It must not be supposed, however, that 
the people’s traditional liberties were ignored. Even 
Henry VIII ‘encouraged, fostered and developed 
Parliament ; he respected its privileges, he recognized 
its authority, he extended its sphere; and he helped 
to forge the weapon which was to overthrow the 
monarchy ’.* 
There wasneed for a strong Governmentin the case of; 
1. Henry VII. Throne insecure. 
1 Pollard, Factors in Modern History, p. 126.
-P-A-G-E-104
  104 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
2. Henry VIII. Struggle with the Church—a period 
of revolution. 
8. Elizabeth. Struggle with Catholic Europe. But 
Elizabeth, and later, the Stuarts, wished to continue 
this form of government when all need for it had passed. 
C. The struggle between King and Parliament, 1603-42. 
Some of the chief points at issue were : 
1. Freedom of speech in Parliament. 
2. Responsibility of the king’s ministers to Parlia- 
ment. 
"3, Freedom of members from arrests, 
4. Exclusive right of Parliament to levy taxes. 
5. The use of the arbitrary courts. 
6. The dependence of the judges of the ordinary 
courts upon the king. 
It is unnecessary for the teacher to attempt a com- 
plete survey of this period, since the above ideas can be 
taught through the detailed study of selected subjects 
such as the points at issue in James I’s first Parliament, 
the attack on the Duke of Buckingham, the Petition 
of Right, the struggle over Ship Money, the prosecution 
of Prynne, Burton, and Bastwick in the Court of Star 
Chamber, and the work of the Long Parliament. 
D. The Civil War and downfall of Charles. 
Here, again, it will be wise to restrict the children’s 
attention to a few events. 
The outstanding battles of the war, such as Edgehill, 
Marston Moor, and Naseby, should be studied, not as 
isolated facts, however, but as the culminating points of 
military campaigns. If events in the war occurred in 
the neighbourhood of the school, these can be studied 
more fully without losing the sense of proportion
-P-A-G-E-105
    THE SIXTH YEAR 105 
between events, e.g. in Yorkshire the war in the north 
of England, or, to take a more limited area, in the West 
Riding of Yorkshire, can be studied in detail.’ The 
Civil War becomes something more than a mere 
abstraction to a child in Leeds when he is given an 
account of the attack on that town by Sir T. Fairfax. 
After Naseby we can centre the work round the 
fortunes of the defeated king. Without attempting 
to understand fully the intrigues and negotiations 
between the Scots, Charles, the Army, and the Parlia- 
ment, the children can study the movement which 
brought Charles to the scaffold. 
E. The Republican Experiment. 
The-work on this topic will naturally centre round 
the person of Cromwell. Some of the points to be 
studied are: the suppression of the Royalists, especially 
in Scotland and Ireland; the unsuccessful attempts to 
reconstruct the machinery of government; the rise of 
Cromwell to absolute power through the need for a 
strong hand to save England from anarchy; and the - 
reasons for the failure of the attempt to form a republic. 
As to this last point, the children should know that 
the Commonwealth was established by a minority of 
the people of England, that the power of this minority 
_ rested, not upon the will of the people, but upon the 
victorious army, that it had little or no experience in 
the work of government, and, lastly, that having 
secured the power to rule, it was as absolute in its 
government as the late king. The death of Charles 
was not followed by any attempt to establish political 
and religious liberty. (Cf. the leaders of the French 
1 Consult Clements Markham, Life of the Great Lord Fairfax.
-P-A-G-E-106
    106 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Revolution and also the Pilgrim Fathers). A revolution 
in the name of liberty became at once an instrument 
of tyranny in the hands of the successful minority. 
F. Struggle between King and People, 1660-88. 
In this period there was a revival of misrule which 
suggests the futility of the Great Rebellion. The work 
can centre round the development of absolutism by 
Charles and James. 
1. Institution of a regular army at the Restoration. 
Declaration of the Parliament of 1661 that the king had 
sole control of the militia. (The struggle over the militia 
was one of the immediate causes of the Civil War.) 
2. Independent attitude of Charles towards Parlia- 
ment—was receiving grants from Louis XIV. Rise of 
Whigs and Tories. Alteration of town charters to 
secure Tory representation from the boroughs and 
hence a permanent Tory majority in the House of 
Commons. Attempts by James II to interfere in the 
constitution of Parliament. 
3. The King’s control of the administration of justice. 
Appointment of judges and magistrates was in the 
hands of the Crown. The Habéas wae Act. Judge 
Jeffreys and the Bloody Assize. 
G. The Revolution, 1688-9. 
1. Events leading up to the abdication of James and 
the appointment of William and Mary as King and 
Queen. 
2. The Bill of Rights. The principles of political 
liberty were now definitely enunciated as a guarantee 
against royal despotism. These principles were not yet 
secured against violation by the sovereign, e.g. bribery 
and corruption in the eighteenth century often deprived
-P-A-G-E-107

Parliament of its independence and brought it into 
subjection to the executive. But the great battle had 
been won by the people, whose privileges were never 
again seriously disputed.

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE WORK OF THE SEVENTH AND 
EIGHTH YEARS 
So far our pupils have been brought to the threshold 
of the present. They have studied the origin and 
growth of the nation, the steps by which England 
attained a predominant position in Europe, the intel- 
lectual, religious, and political development of the 
nation, and the social and industrial condition of the 
people in various epochs. It remains for us now to 
complete the survey of the evolution of modern 
England by studying the social and industrial develop- 
ment since the eighteenth century, the expansion of 
the Empire, the growth of our present constitutional 
form of government, and some of the more important 
events in the history of England’s foreign relations. 
I. Inpustrian AND SocraL DEVELOPMENT 
1. Introduction. 
To emphasize the great progress made since the 
middle of the eighteenth century, contrasts can be 
formed between that time and the present on the fol- 
lowing points: agriculture ; textile manufactures,includ- 
ing very brief account of processes and localities; ironand 
coal industries ; transportation of goods and means of 
communication ; commerce ; town life ; population.

centuries. 
This will be a suitable point at which to begin the 
study of industrial and social development, since
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 THE TEACHING QF HISTORY 
‘agriculture was the principal industry of England 
until after the Industrial Revolution. Lessons could 
be given on the following topics: Improvements in 
farming, including introduction of new crops, im- 
provements in stock-raising, new methods of treating 
the soil, and improvements in farming implements ; 
enclosures, with special reference to local examples ; 
the Corn Laws ; condition of the agricultural labourer 
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 
3. Industrial England before the Mechanical Revolution. 
(a) The textile trades in the eighteenth century— 
woollen, cotton, linen, and silk ; the districts in which 
these manufactures were carried on before the intro- 
duction of machinery ; the processes of manufacture ; 
the sources of raw materials and the markets for the 
finished. goods. 
(b) The organization of industry. Independent cot- 
tage workers ; the use of capital in the textile trades 
and the rise of a wage-earning class ; the first factories. 
The advantages of (1) the domestic system of inde- 
pendent workers, (2) the system of cottage workers 
employed by a capitalist, and (3) the factory system. 
(c) The regulation of industry by Government. 
(1) Direct regulations of the Tudors and Stuarts, 
affecting all branches of industry, were still in force in 
the eighteenth century, although in many cases they 
had become obsolete. 
(2) Indirect control of industry through the imposi- 
tion of customs duties, especially in the latter part of 
the seventeenth century.’ 
(d) Adam Smith and The Wealth of Nations (1776). 
A simple account of his doctrine of industrial and

THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH YEARS 111 
commercial freedom, with some indication of its 
influence, will help to explain (1) the beginning of the 
Free Trade movement, and (2) the attitude of the 
Government towards the workers during the period of 
rapid industrial change which follows. 
4. The Mechanical Changes. 
(a) In the textile trades—preliminary processes, 
spinning, weaving, and finishing, including calico 
printing. 
The improved machines were only slowly introduced. 
(b) Application of power to these machines—(1) the 
use of water-power, (2) the introduction of the steam- 
engine. 
(c) The iron and coal trades in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. The mechanical changes and 
the application of steam to machinery made iron and 
coal indispensable in industry. The development of 
these industries can therefore be studied at this point. 
(d) Improvements in transport—a necessary conse- 
quence of the increase in manufactures. The roads, 
which up to 1760 were the only means of transport, 
apart from navigable rivers, were quite inadequate. 
Hence the development of canals, and, later, of 
railways. 
It is not necessary that our pupils should study the 
details of the actual mechanical changes; but they 
must know the industrial effects of the improvements. 
5. The Results of the Mechanical Changes. 
The most important effects were the following : 
(a) The movement of industry. There was aconcen- 
tration of labour in factories, and the rise of modern 
factory towns; and there were also changes in   
   
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
localities, e.g. decline of the cloth trade in East Anglia, 
and the growing importance of Yorkshire. 
By means of a series of population maps for different 
periods the class can study the gradual change in the 
population of England with regard to (1) increase in 
population, (2) growth of industrial towns, (3) move- 
ment of the centre of gravity from the south to the 
midlands and north of England. 
(b) The increased demand for raw materials and the 
increased output of goods, resulting in increased com- 
merce and national wealth. 
(c) The growing importance of capitalin industry, and 
the growing breach between employers and employed. 
(d) Social effects, (1) great distress in some cases 
during the period of transition, (2) increased instability 
of employment—goods were now not merely manu- 
factured to meet the steady needs of the locality, but 
large orders were completed for distant markets, 
(3) the concentration of work in factories and in certain 
districts where power-water or coal was accessible, led 
to the decay of cottage industry and village life. 
Spinning by hand became unprofitable and much 
distress appeared, (4) modern social problems connected 
with town life and the factory system. 
6. Commerce and Free Trade. 
(a) Growth of British commerce and shipping in the 
eighteenth century to 1793. 
(6) Commerce during the Great War, 1793-1815. 
The Continental System, the Berlin and Milan Decrees 
and the English Orders-in-Council1_ Interesting com- 
parisons can be made with the commercial and naval

antagonism of Great Britain and Germany during the 
recent war. 
(c) British commerce and shipping in the nineteenth 
century since 1815.1 
(d) The Free Trade movement. The gradual removal 
of duties in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ; 
the present tariff; comparisons with America and 
Germany ; the question of Imperial Preference. 
7. Employers and Workers since the Industrial Revolution. 
(a) State intervention to protect the worker. 
A. Improvements in conditions of work. 
(1) History of the chief factory reforms. 
, (2) Reforms in mines. 
(3) Work in shops—hours and conditions of 
work. 
(4) Recent legislation relating to employment 
of children. 
B. Regulation of wages—how far possible and 
advisable. 
C. The unemployed problem—labour exchanges. 
(6) Rise of trade unions. Trade disputes and their 
settlement. Masters’ combinations. 
(c) Participation of the workers in the profits of 
manufacture or trade: (1) profit-sharing and co-part- 
nership, (2) the co-operative movement. 
8. The Poor Law. 
(a) Causes of pauperism since 1750. To what extent 
was it affected by the Industrial Revolution.®

the present.2 A study of these statistics will give some 
idea of the material well-being of the people. 
(b) Health of the people. 
(1) Unsanitary condition of houses and streets in 
earlier times; epidemics; mediaeval hospitals. 
(2). Hospitals and infirmaries in modern times.

Public Health Acts; work of medical officers 
of health, treatment of infectious cases, 
inspection. of school children, feeding of 
necessitous children.

(d) National insurance and old age pensions. 
(e) To sum up, there has been a gradual rise of 
humanitarianism, which is further shown in: (1) changes 
in the laws, e.g. capital punishment for minor offences 
and imprisonment for debt ; (2) prison reform. Teacher 
could give a lesson on the work of John Howard and 
Elizabeth Fry ; (3) abolition of slavery. 
(f) Growth of popular education. 
(1) Education at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century—types of schools, subjects of study, 
harshness of the schools. 
(2) Development of elementary education in nine- 
teenth century—Government supervision of 
education ; establishment of compulsory free 
education; evening schools; the educa- 
tional ladder. 
II. Tar Growtn or THE EMPIRE 
1. A Comparison. 
The subject can be introduced to the class by making 
a comparison of the extent of the Empire at various 
dates between 1763 and to-day. This can best be done 
by a series of specially prepared maps, e.g. maps of 
the world showing the Empire in 1763, 1783, 1815, 
1850, 1885, and the present time ; or series of maps of 
North America, Africa, India, and Australasia, to show 
the development of British power in these regions. 
2. Expansion of British Power in North America. 
Some of the most interesting events and movements 
in the history of Canada during the nineteenth century 
are: . 
(a) The war between Great Britain and the United 
States, 1812-14—attack on Canada. 
H2
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(b) The history of the Hudson Bay Company—the 
fur trade of the North. 
(c) The founding of the Red River Settlement 
(Manitoba), 1811-21. 
(d) The Rebellion of Papineau and Mackenzie, 
1837-8. 
(e) The development of farming in Canada; the 
opening up of the western plains; the Canadian 
Pacific Railway. 
(f) The history of the mining industry in Canada ; 
gold discoveries in British Columbia and the Upper 
Yukon (Klondike). 
8. Expansion of British Power in India since 1763. 
It is impossible to do more than teach the broad 
outlines with details of a few outstanding events 
such as: 
(a) The work of Clive in Bengal. 
(b) War in the south with the French and Hyder Ali 
of Mysore, 1778-82. 
(c) The impeachment of Warren Hastings. 
(d) The work of Marquess Wellesley (Governor- 
General, 1798-1805). Last war against Mysore—Tipu 
Sahib at Seringapatam. The Mahratta War—Arthur 
Wellesley in the Deccan, General Lake in the north. 
(e) The consolidation of British power during the 
governor-generalship of Lord Hastings (1813-23). 
Defeat of the Gurkhas-of Nepal and the Mahrattas. 
(f) First Afghan War, 1837-43. 
(g) The Sikh Wars, 1845-9. 
(h) The Mutiny. (1) Causes. (2) Events, especially 
the massacre at Cawnpore and the Siege of Lucknow. 
(3) Results. 
(i) Troubles on the north-west frontiers. (1) Afghan
-P-A-G-E-117
  THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH YEARS 117 
War, 1878-80—the march to Kandahar. (2) Chitral, 
1895. 
(k) What England‘has done for India. 
4. Expansion of British Power in Australia. 
(a) Captain Cook’s voyages. 
(b) The convict settlement in New South Wales. 
(c) Early explorers of New South Wales. 
(d) The transcontinental journeys of (1) Stuart, and 
Burke and Wills (south to north). (2) Eyre, the 
Forrests, Warburton and Giles (east to west). 
(e) The gold discoveries in New South Wales, Victoria, 
and West Australia—influence on the history of these 
colonies. 
(f) Australia in the last generation. (1) Development 
of industries. (2) Colonial Federation. 
5. Expansion of British Power in Africa. 
The subject can be introduced by studying a political 
map showing the partition of Africa among the Euro- 
pean states. The class should particularly notice the 
possessions of France, Germany, and Great Britain 
before the Great War of 1914. A brief account of 
German aspirations with regard to Africa and the 
attempts to fulfil them during the last generation can 
be given at this point. 
The class can then proceed to study the history of 
the various British possessions. 
(a) South Africa. 
(1) Early settlers at the Cape—Dutch and British. 
(2) The Great Trek—its causes and consequences 
—the foundation of Natal, Orange Free State, 
and the Transvaal. 
(3) The relations between Boers and British from 
the Sand River Convention to Majuba Hill.
-P-A-G-E-118
  118. THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(4) The work of Cecil Rhodes as an empire builder 
—the extension of British power northwards. 
(5) The South African War, 1899-1902. 
(6) The consolidation of South Africa. 
(b) The West Coast Settlements. The historical details 
need not be remembered, but the class should know 
the nature of these possessions—that they originated 
as trading-posts and still retain this character. They 
are valuable from a commercial, but not from a 
colonizing point of view. 
Any interesting topics, e.g. the explorations of 
Mungo Park, or the Ashanti Wars, can be profitably 
studied in detail. 
(c) British East Africa. The most important points 
are: 
(1) Our relations with Zanzibar, as an illustration 
of one means by which the British Empire has 
expanded. 
(2) Our relations with the Germans in East Africa 
—the demarcation of boundaries—the East 
African campaign in the recent war. 
(3) The development of Uganda. 
(d) Egypt and the Eastern Soudan. A study of the 
following topics will enable the class to understand the 
present position of the British in the Nile valley : 
(1) Mehemet Ali, the founder of modern Egypt. 
(2) The work of Gordon in the Soudan. 
(3) Egyptian bankruptcy—interference of Great 
Britain and France—rebellion of Arabi 
Pasha. 
(4) The loss of the Soudan—rise of the Mahdi— 
massacre of Gordon and the garrison at 
Khartoum.
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH YEARS 119 
(5) The reconquest of the Soudan—Kitchener at 
Omdurman. 
(6) The work of Lord Cromer in Egypt. 
6. The Empire as a Source of Strength and of Responsi- 
bilities. 
An admirable subject for an essay by the class, since 
the knowledge required is to a great extent incidental 
and comes through taking an interest in recent events. 
Should the subject be considered too wide for a single 
essay, such topics as the following can be dealt with 
separately : 
(a) Commercial value of colonies nil dependencies. 
(6) What the mother country owes the Colonies. 
(c) What the Colonies owe the mother country. 
7. The Future of the Empire. 
Questions such as the following can be discussed 
with the class : 
(a) Imperial Federation. 
(b) Colonial Preference. 
(c) The Defence of the Empire. 
III. THe DevELopMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
GOVERNMENT 
The duties and privileges of English citizens are only 
intelligible to future citizens when viewed in the light 
of their history; and the political opinions of the 
multitude can only be freed from dogmatism and 
prejudice when the multitude brings history to its 
aid in comprehending the questions of the moment. 
These, then, are the reasons for making our pupils 
1H. E. Egerton, Origin and Growth of English Colonies, chap. x ; 
Sir C. Dilke, Problems of Greater Britain.
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
acquainted with the development of our system of 
government. 
The task, however, is a difficult one. Scylla and 
Charybdis await to wreck the teacher’s efforts and 
give his class a distaste for the subject. On the one 
hand is the antiquarian aspect of constitutional history, 
which must be carefully avoided; on the other is the 
complex machine of modern government, which is 
never really intelligible except by first-hand acquaint- 
ance. The following suggestions may help the teacher 
to steer a middle course : 
1. Character of Teutonic government in tribal times. 
We find here the germ of self-government. 
2. Development of English local government. 
(a) The local courts of the village, hundred, and shire 
in Anglo-Saxon times. A comprehensive account of 
their functions is unnecessary, but brief references 
should be made to their administrative and judicial 
work in order to illustrate their representative 
character. 
These local institutions survived the Norman Con- 
quest and continued, though much decayed, until the 
close of the Middle Ages. That is, the idea of self- 
government always existed in England. 
(6) Modern local government. If the school is 
situated in a town, the history of the government of 
that particular town can be studied in order to illus- 
trate some, at least, of the following points: Town 
government in the Middle Ages, charters of incor- 
poration, the Guildhall, need for reform in the early 
part of the nineteenth century, the Municipal Corpora- 
tion Act, 1835, the creation of new boroughs since 
1835 county boroughs.
-P-A-G-E-121
eg eg ee Se eS ee ee Te en ee eee 
THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH YEARS 121 
In rural schools the development of county govern- 
ment can be studied, e.g. government of the counties 
by the justices of the peace in Quarter Sessions from 
Tudor times until 1888; modern revival of local self- 
government by the institution of county councils, 
: urban and rural district councils, and parish councils. 
The foundation .of county courts (1846) can be 
referred to here to avoid confusion with the shire courts 
of early times. 
3. Development of Central Government. 
(a) The Witenagemote of Saxon times contrasted 
with Parliament to-day. 
(b) The Council of the Norman kings. 
(c) The beginnings of Parliament in the thirteenth 
and fourteenth centuries. 
(1) Representation from the counties, 1213, 1254. 
(2) Representation from the towns, 1265, 1295. 
(3) Division into two houses. 
(d) The powers and privileges of Parliament. Refer- 
ence should be made here to the growth of political 
liberty studied in the sixth year. The following points 
should be emphasized : 
(1) Exclusive right of the Commons to control 
money matters. 
(2) Responsibility of the king’s ministers to 
Parliament. 
(3) Freedom from interference by the king—free- 
dom in elections, freedom in the expression 
of opinions, freedom from arrest. 
(e) Growth of party government and the cabinet 
system. 
(f) Parliamentary reform in the nineteenth century. 
(1) State of affairs before 1832—composition of 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Parliament, the franchise, attitude of Parlia- 
ment towards the people, attempts at reform. 
(2) Reform Bill of 1832. To what extent was it 
a remedy ? 
(3) The Chartist Movement. 
(4) The Acts of 1867, 1884, and 1885. Ballot Act, 
1872. i 
(5) The Future—need for further reform. 
4. Changed position of the Sovereign. 
The king’s administrative, legislative, and judicial 
powers have gradually been delegated to ministers, 
assemblies, and courts. By way of revision contrasts 
may be made between the actual powers of such kings 
as Alfred, Henry II, Henry VIII, George III, and 
George V. 
IV. Enewann’s FornicN RELATIONS 
The aims of this section are: 
1. To explain the international relations which led 
up to the Great War of 1914. 
2. By descriptions of previous wars in the nineteenth 
century, to emphasize the magnitude of the recent 
war, and the tremendous developments in the organiza- 
tion of war and in methods of fighting. 
3. To explain the position of Great Britain in 
Europe at the present time. 
These aims can be best attained by restricting the 
attention of the class to a limited number of topics 
such as the following : 
(a) The Crimean War. 
(6) The Franco-Prussian War. Could England’s 
neutrality be justified ?
-P-A-G-E-123
THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH YEARS 123 
(c) Events in the Balkans leading up to the Treaty 
of Berlin, 1878. England’s part in these affairs. 
(d) The main lines of German development since 
1870. 
(e) Events leading up to the Great War of 1914. 
A bare political outline of these topics will be useless, 
since it is by a good supply of definite interesting facts, 
not by vague abstractions, that a boy acquires new 
ideas in history.

CHAPTER IX 
THE ORAL LESSON 
   
  Tue historical knowledge which we think it desirable 
for the children to have can be imparted in two ways : 
by the words of the teacher, or by books and original 
sources. Of these, the oral method is naturally the 
one more frequently used. Even when suitable books 
are available—and this is rarely the case—private study 
can only be attempted in upper classes, and then must 
be supervised by the teacher. The examination of 
sources, which is a form of private study, demands 
still more control by the teacher. Oral work must, 
in fact, remain the primary method of teaching through- 
out the school. Private study, however, provides 
valuable training in the use of books and a feeling 
of self-reliance which is absent from oral work. The 
oral work should therefore, whenever possible, be 
supplemented by book work as soon as the chil- 
dren are capable of using books under the teacher’s 
guidance. 
There are two essential characteristics of a good oral 
history lesson: a wise selection of facts, and ability 
to impart these facts in the most effective way. 
I. Even in the upper classes the facts selected must 
be particular and definite rather than general and 
indefinite. Where the teacher aims at imparting some 
general idea it must be illustrated by particular facts. 
For example, reference to the water galas on the Thames

by which means Henry VIII celebrated the imprison- 
ment of Anne Boleyn, and the mere mention of the fact 
that Henry was betrothed to Jane Seymour the day 
following Anne’s execution, and married her ten days 
later, will make a far greater impression than endless 
generalities about Henry’s character. 
Details may be a burden in a lesson and mere mental 
lumber to the child even when learnt; but wisely 
selected, they will illuminate and vivify the stories 
of the past. Take a simple example: The children 
have had a lesson on life in a mediaeval monastery, 
and this has been followed by a visit to a ruined abbey. 
Standing with his pupils in the church of the abbey, 
the teacher calls attention to the stairs leading from 
the monks’ dormitory to the church, down which they 
came for the services during the night. But the children 
can form no true mental picture of the sleepy monks 
creeping down the stairs into the church unless they 
know something about the appearance of the monks and 
of the church. The monks with their tonsured heads, 
flowing garments and sandalled feet, the dimly lit 
church, cold and still, the rood screen, the choir stalls, 
the altar: these are the details with which the child 
fills in his picture if the scene is to be real to him. 
Or the class may be studying the American War of 
Independence. The teacher will find many opportuni- 
ties here of giving particular facts rather than general, 
vague ones. For example : 
_ 1. It is of little use merely to tell the class that 
Burke and Chatham were opposed to the attitude of 
the English Government towards the colonists. The 
teacher should supply the children with extracts from 
the speeches of these men to illustrate their attitude.
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(a) The following are from speeches made by Chatham 
in the House of Lords : + 
‘My Lords, I am an old man and would advise the 
noble lords in office to adopt a more gentle mode of 
governing America; for the day is not far distant, when 
America may vie with these kingdoms, not only in 
arms, but in arts also.’ 
‘ This has always been my received and unalterable 
opinion, and I will carry it to my grave, that this 
country has no right under Heaven to tax America.’ 
(Speech in 1774.) 
In May 1777 he appeared in the House of Lords 
supported by crutches, and declared : 
“You may ravage, you cannot conquer; it is im- 
possible : you cannot conquer the Americans. I might 
as well talk of driving them before me with this crutch.’ 
Later in the same year he was speaking against the 
use of German mercenaries in the war, and said: ‘ If 
I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while 
a foreign troop was landed in my country I never would 
lay down my arms—never—never—never.’ 
(b) Burke in 1774 was urging the Government to 
repeal the tax on tea, and in the same speech was 
attacking the indecision of the Government in their 
attitude towards America. He declared, ‘ Let us, sir, 
embrace some system or other before we end this 
session. Do you mean to tax America, and to draw 
a productive revenue from thence? If you do, speak 
out; name, fix, ascertain, this revenue; settle its 
quantity; define its objects; provide for its collection; 
and then fight when you have something to fight for. 
If you murder—rob ; if you kill, take possession; and

do not appear in the character of madmen, as well 
as assassins, violent, vindictive, bloody, and tyrannical 
without an object. But may better counsels guide you! 
“Again, and again, revert to your old principles— 
seek peace and ensue it—leave America, if she has 
taxable matter in her, to tax herself.’ 
2. In speaking of the commercial restrictions imposed 
upon the colonists particulars can be given without 
making the lesson dull. If the children know that, 
amongst other restrictions, the colonists were com- 
pelled to export some of their most important products, 
as tobacco, cotton, and sugar, only to England ; that 
no foreign vessels might enter their harbours; that, 
with certain exceptions, they could import no foreign 
goods except by way of England; that many goods, 
as cloth and hardware, might not be manufactured 
in America ; they will then be better able to under- 
stand the growing breach between America and England. 
3. The character of the English Government during 
this period, a vital factor in the relations with America, 
can be illustrated by definite facts on such points as 
the incompetence of ministers, the corruption of 
Parliament, and the King’s position in the Government. 
‘Thus, Grafton and Rockingham were great racing men, 
North was weak and easily overruled by the King. 
Bribery of members of Parliament by the Crown was 
a common means of securing a majority for the 
Government. The King was determined to be the real 
head of his Government, and his stubbornness and 
short-sightedness in all matters relating to America 
contributed much to the unwise attitude of the Govern- 
ment towards the Colonies. 
4. In speaking of the growing unrest in the Colonies 
1977 I

130 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
examples should be given beyond the time-honoured 
story of the Boston Tea Party; e.g. the burning 
of the Gaspee, the Boston Riot, and the outcry against 
Governor Hutchinson on the publication of his letters. 
Enough has been said to demonstrate the importance 
of having plenty of interesting particular facts. They 
may not all be remembered; but this is often of little 
consequence, since we are using them to teach larger, 
more general ideas. Often the details necessary to 
make a subject understood can be given by the creation 
of fictitious characters and events. If we create a parish 
priest and give him a name and a parish in order that 
our description of church life in the Middle Ages may 
be clearer and less vague than it would otherwise be, 
or if we create a typical manor to illustrate life in the 
country,’ then our ‘story’ conveys a good deal of 
knowledge in pleasant form. 
- There is a further principle to be considered in 
selecting the facts to be taught. The lesson must 
be a gradual development of one or more central ideas, 
not a string of facts with little connexion between 
them. This lack of unity is often conspicuous in lessons 
dealing with great movements, as the Reformation, 
when facts of various kinds are massed together with 
little thought of the confusing influence they will have 
upon the children’s minds. The Reformation was an 
exceedingly complex movement which our pupils can- 
not possibly understand unless we teach the various 
phases separately. The separation from Rome, the 
dissolution of the monasteries, the introduction of the 
1 See the account of the fictitious manor of Tubney at various 
periods in C. R. L. Fletcher’s Introductory History of England, e. g. 
vol. ii, chap. viii, An Elizabethan Squire.
-P-A-G-E-131
THE ORAL LESSON 131 
English Bible and service books, the attack on shrines, 
images, and relics: each of these aspects deserves a 
separate lesson. 
Further examples are not necessary to illustrate 
the need for selecting a definite topic for each lesson. 
Sometimes coherence can be given to the subject- 
matter by grouping the facts round the life of some 
great character. But in treating a subject biographi- 
cally there is a tendency to connect facts unduly with 
the character selected. For example, there is no 
justification for dealing biographically with the great 
struggle between King and People in Stuart times by 
including under the general subject-heading of ‘Oliver 
Cromwell ’ all events of importance on the subject from 
1603 or even from 1642. Cromwell after the war was 
the leading figure, but did not hold the centre of the 
stage in the Long Parliament during its momentous 
sittings before the war, and had little or no influence 
in the reign of James. The life of a great man can be 
of most use in history teaching when it is representative 
of a class of society or of a great movement. The 
Earl of Warwick, last of the barons, illustrates the 
great power of the barons in the fifteenth century ; 
Joan of Arc typifies the growing national feeling in 
France against the English ; Hampden is the repre- 
sentative Puritan resisting the high claims of the Stuart 
king ; Wyclif illustrates the religious unrest of the 
fourteenth century. History is not the biography of 
great men, for history is concerned with the life of the 
people as a whole. Much in the life of the people, 
however, can be illustrated by reference to the lives of 
great men; much in the life of every great man is of 
no importance in history.

-P-A-G-E-132
132 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
II. The second feature of good oral teaching is 
effectiveness in the method of telling the story. Since 
history teaching is to a great extent story-telling, it fol- 
lows that the teacher must have the qualities of a good 
story-teller. Some of these qualities are the following: 
1. A thorough command of the facts so that they 
can be recalled without effort or hesitation as the 
story proceeds. Unless the teacher’s knowledge is 
full and sound there is a probability that the facts 
will not be arranged in the most suitable way. In 
narrative work the episodes of the story must follow 
one another naturally and unhesitatingly if we are to 
hold the attention and rouse the interest of the class. 
So often a story is marred by the teacher remembering 
an important incident too late and attempting to 
insert it when he has proceeded too far. 
When the oral work is descriptive the teacher aims 
at the creation of clear mental pictures which are the 
result of gradual development. We begin by giving 
a very brief outline, somewhat as a painter does who 
sketches in the outlines in charcoal. As we work at 
our description the details are gradually added by the 
child to the picture in his mind. Suppose, for example, 
a teacher wishes to describe the hall of a baron’s castle 
and a scene there during a feast. He should not 
describe in detail the interior of the hall, with its open 
wooden roof, the deep, mullioned windows, the walls 
hung with tapestries, the floor covered with rushes, 
before any mention of the tables, the people, and the 
feast. The children require first a brief glance at the 
whole scene, and then such details as are necessary to 
make the picture clear and realistic. Along methodi- 
cal description without incident is tedious to children.
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE ORAL LESSON 133 
2. It is equally important that the teacher should 
understand the mental capacity of the children he is 
teaching. We so often fail because we have insufficient 
knowledge of the mental content of the child. We do 
not realize his paucity of ideas or the narrowness of 
meaning which words have for him. ‘Perhaps the 
greatest difficulty in teaching young children is that 
teacher and taught almost speak different languages, 
for though they use the same words, the meanings 
implied are far from being the same. One can never 
give good oral teaching until one has mastered with 
approximate accuracy the real speech of one’s pupils, 
so that one knows what kinds of meanings one’s words 
will call up in their minds.’ + 
3. A third characteristic of a good story-teller is 
a fluent command of language and ability to adapt 
voice and manner to suit the subject-matter. A 
teacher who cannot forget himself and become truly 
dramatic lacks one of the essential qualities for telling 
a good story. At first a young teacher is intensely 
self-conscious ; he is afraid to ‘let himself go’. But 
if he will always prepare his lesson thoroughly, and 
rehearse it beforehand, not necessarily aloud, he will 
soon find the awkwardness disappearing. He will 
learn that some parts of a story can be lightly passed 
over, whilst other parts must be told impressively, 
that the voice must be regulated in tone and speed, 
that the manner must be natural, the actions being 
neither stiff nor exaggerated. With more experience 
he will learn that a well-told story is a work of art 
and the story-teller an artist of the highest degree. 
But oral teaching in history is more than story-telling, 
1 Welton, Psychology of Education, pp. 349-50.  
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
The principal aim of story-telling as an art is to produce 
an aesthetic effect, but history teaching, except in the 
lowest classes, aims also at imparting knowledge. 
Indeed, in the upper part of the school this is our 
main purpose, and the aesthetic and moral effect of 
what we teach is quite subsidiary. It follows then, 
that we must adopt those methods of teaching by which 
we ensure that knowledge imparted has been really 
assimilated. Questioning by teacher and children, and 
the active co-operation of the class through the use of 
note-books and through exercises of various kinds, 
are the most usual means of guaranteeing that the work 
has been thoroughly understood by the children. 
No good oral work is possible without some question- 
ing, but how far the teacher’s exposition should be 
interrupted by questions, asked either by himself or 
by the children, is a matter to be decided partly by 
the character of the oral lesson, and partly by the age 
of the children. With older pupils the oral work often 
takes the form of a discussion which corrects and 
extends the knowledge they have already gained of 
a particular topic. The class begins with a foundation 
of knowledge, and questions by both teacher and class 
are an important feature of the work. The mental 
activity of such a class should not be limited to the 
imagination of scenes or the comprehension of facts, 
but should include efforts to reason out causes and 
effects, and to form sound opinions based on the facts. 
In a word, the children should be trained to develop 
a critical and not merely a receptive attitude of mind, 
and this is impossible without questions. 
In another case a class of boys ten years old are 
having a lesson on the discovery of America by the 
   
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE ORAL LESSON 135 
Norsemen. Here the teacher must impart practically 
all the facts, but as the lesson proceeds many questions 
may be asked by teacher and pupils without inter- 
| rupting the thread of the story. If the teacher tells 
the story without demanding more from the boys than 
passive listening, they will lapse into an apathetic state. 
But if they can be induced to co-operate with the teacher 
they will be alert and eager throughout the lesson. 
Where, however, a story is being told to a young 
class by a good story-teller they will sit enthralled. 
Questions by the teacher are naturally resented, 
whilst questions by the children are not to be encouraged 
until the story is ended. 
Almost equally important is the use of note-books, 
Note-taking, whilst it must not occupy too large a 
share of the time, is an important feature of most 
lessons. in the middle and upper classes. At first the 
notes must be dictated by the teacher or copied from 
the blackboard. Later, the children will be able to 
make their own notes, either at intervals during the 
lesson when the teacher pauses to enable the class to 
do this, or at the end. Children even in the top classes 
will rarely, if ever, be able to make satisfactory notes 
during the progress of the lesson. The note-books, 
besides being used for notes of oral lessons, will contain 
simple date charts, sketches, maps, diagrams, original 
exfracts, and illustrative poems. In the upper classes 
they should also contain lists of books for reference, 
when such books are available, and historical novels. 
Note-books developed on these lines will be of eee 
use for purposes of reference and revision. 
Oral work, in order to be successful, must usually 
be followed by some active exercise on the part of the  
-P-A-G-E-136
136 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
child which will enable him to revise and fix the know- 
ledge gained during the lesson. Rapid oral questioning 
is of little value for revision, as the children’s attention 
is directed to isolated facts, whilst the connexions 
between the facts, which is so important a part of 
historical study, tend to become obscured. Ability 
to reproduce isolated facts is no criterion that the 
children understand the matter taught. Infinitely 
better are continuous oral or written answers, occasional 
debates in the upper classes, dramatization of scenes 
in lower classes, and exercises in art and handwork. 
The lesson can also be followed up by the study of 
literary extracts in prose and verse bearing upon the 
subject, the examination of sources, and the use of 
books. These methods will be discussed in subsequent 
chapters. 
Another condition of successful work is the wise use 
ot illustrations. But this subject also is too important 
to be dealt with here in an incidental way and has 
been reserved for a later chapter. 
A question which can, however, be conveniently 
considered at this point is the extent to which dates 
should be learnt. The central idea in history is develop- 
ment; and in order to study development we must be 
able to put events and conditions in their right places 
chronologically, so that we can examine them by 
comparison and contrast with events occurring and 
conditions existing in other periods. That is, we must 
have some knowledge of the correct sequence of events 
and the periods of time elapsing between events 
which are in some way related. The opinion of Locke 
on this point is instructive. ‘ Without geography and 
chronology, I say, history will be very ill retained and 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE ORAL LESSON 137 
very little useful ; but be only a jumble of matters of 
fact, confusedly heaped together without order or 
instruction. It is by these two that the actions of 
mankind are ranked into their proper places of times 
and countries; under which circumstances they are 
not only much easier kept in the memory, but in that 
natural order are only capable to afford those observa- 
tions which make a man the better and the abler for 
reading them.’ + 
Some attention, then, must be paid to the learning 
of dates. A beginning can be made by the children 
gradually constructinga skeleton of dates and prominent 
events, which will be of great use in locating events 
studied later on. Very early in the school course the 
stories told to the class might be arranged in chronologi- 
cal order and a time chart constructed by the children 
to illustrate them. Although exact dates need not 
always be given, such a chart would be the beginning 
of a system of dates which would be continually 
developed. There is no intrinsic objection, however, 
to a few exact dates being given. To some teachers 
it may appear useless to trouble a young child who has 
been hearing the story of the battle of Crécy with the 
exact date 1346, especially as he has no appreciation 
of the length of time since this event occurred. But 
is this an important objection? A long period of time 
which is naturally beyond the range of our experience 
can only be understood at all by comparison with 
shorter periods with which we are more or less 
acquainted. The fact that the battle of Crécy was 
fought in the year 1346 would therefore be learnt, not 
in order that the children might appreciate duration 
1 Some Thoughts concerning Education, 1690. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  138. THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of time, since this is impossible, but as a date which 
later on could be used for purposes of comparison. 
For example, when other battles in other periods are 
studied, such as Agincourt, 1415, Flodden Field, 1513, 
Marston Moor, 1644, Blenheim, 1704, and Waterloo, 
1815, we can trace the progress of the art of war, 
which would be impossible unless we could locate, at 
least approximately, the time when each of these 
battles was fought. Since, also, we remember facts 
by association, the date 1346 will be a landmark with 
which we can associate other events of the fourteenth 
century. The Black Death appeared in England three 
years later, the battle of Poictiers was won ten years later, 
the naval victory at Sluys occurred six years previously. 
Chronology is at the root of all real historical study, 
even in schools, and if in upper classes the children’s 
knowledge is to be worth anything, some dates, either 
exact or approximate, must be learnt in studying 
every event and movement. The absence of a so- 
called ‘time-sense ’, whatever this may mean, is no 
reason why dates should not be remembered. A child 
is quite unable to comprehend the duration of an epoch 
such as the nineteenth century, yet this does not, 
of course, imply that in studying the history of this 
period, dates can be neglected. 
In order to illustrate the methods of oral teaching 
discussed in this chapter suggestions for lessons are 
given below. 
I. ENGLAND IN THE TIME OF ALFRED 
Three lessons. (Age of children, ten years.) 
Books for teacher’s preparation : 
Dodd, Harly English Social History (Bell, 1s. 6d.).
-P-A-G-E-139
    
THE ORAL LESSON 139 
Caton, Old-time Stories, Part II (Macmillan, 6d.). 
Traill and Mann, Social England, vol. i, chap. i. 
Also general books recommended in Appendix III for industrial 
history. 
A central idea is found in an imaginary journey taken 
by King Alfred, with whom the children are already 
well acquainted. He is supposed to travel from his 
royal palace at Wedmore to his capital, Winchester. 
First Lesson. The First Day’s Journey 
1, Alfred’s companions on the journey—some of 
his nobles or thanes, and two or three bishops and 
abbots. Why should these men be with him? (Ilus- 
trations of costume.) 
2. Means of travelling. On horseback or in a rough 
carriage. (Illustration of Anglo-Saxons on a journey.) 
3. The Road. Grassy lanes, often old British or 
Roman trackways. 
4, Appearance of the country. Forests, no level 
roads, small villages of wooden huts. 
5. At the end of the first day the travellers stay at 
a manor belonging to one of the King’s thanes. (Illus- 
tration of an Anglo-Saxon thane’s residence.) Supper 
in the Hall. (Ilustrations of supper-time in a Saxon 
Hall, and after the evening meal in the Hall of a Saxon 
thane; sketches of furniture of the period.) 
Second Lesson. An Anglo-Saxon Manor 
1. The King stays at the manor for a few days. 
Manner of employing his time—hunting the wild boar, 
reading, writing, conferring with his nobles on matters 
of government. 
2. The people of the manor, slaves, serfs, freemen. 
3. The homes of the people.    
-P-A-G-E-140
    140 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
4. Their work on the land. Open fields, land 
cultivated in strips, primitive ploughing, sowing, 
reaping, and threshing. Emphasize the co-operative 
character of this work. (For illustrations of the work 
on the land in early times see Horace Marshall’s 
Historical Albums, Period 1272-1399, iv, price 3d., 
where there are excellent drawings from the Luttrell 
Psalter, 1320. Methods of agriculture made so little 
progress during the Middle Ages that these drawings are, 
no doubt, applicable to the later Anglo-Saxon period.) 
5. The church and parish priest. (Sketches of Anglo- 
Saxon churches.) 
Conclusion. Ask children whether they would like 
to live in an Anglo-Saxon village. By a discussion of 
this question the children will review the main points 
of the lesson and will also be led to make comparisons 
between social conditions a thousand years ago and 
to-day. 
Third Lesson. The Completion of the Journey 
1. People met with on the journey. Outlaws and 
robbers would keep out of the way, but an occasional 
chapman might be seen. 
2. The travellers call at a monastery. Some account 
of Anglo-Saxon monastic life in this period when the 
monasteries were degenerating. 
3. At this point an incident can be introduced to illus- 
trate Anglo-Saxon methods of dealing with criminals. 
The travellers meet a number of men who are pursuing 
acriminal. These men are not the police, but the man’s 
own friends (Anglo-Saxon system of mutual responsi- 
bility for good behaviour). We may leave King Alfred 
for a time and follow the fugitive. He is caught, and
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE ORAL LESSON 141 
after being kept in prison for a time is tried. Trial, 
not by jury as to-day, but by undergoing some ordeal, 
or by bringing twelve men who will say, on oath, that 
the accused is a man of good character (consult Low 
and Pulling’s Dictionary of English History or a constitu- 
tional history, e.g. Medley, or Stubbs, for an account 
of the Ordeal and Compurgation). 
His punishment, if guilty, differed from punishments 
to-day. Fines for every offence (read extracts from 
‘ Alfred’s Dooms’, Kendall, Source Book of English 
History, p.17). A criminal was outlawed if the fine was 
not paid. 
4. We return to the travellers. Their arrival at 
Winchester—description of a town in Anglo-Saxon 
times (illustration, entrance to an Anglo-Saxon walled 
town). 
Teaching Notes 
1. Constant comparisons should be made with the 
present day, so that children can note great progress 
in various ways since time of Alfred. 
2. The teacher must use his imagination and develop 
the subject-matter of these lessons into a vivid con- 
nected narrative. He must invent incidents and char- 
acters to make the story realistic. 
3. Illustrations are an important feature of these 
lessons ; those mentioned above are found in Long- 
mans’ Historical Illustrations, Portfolio I (2s. 6d.). 
They are too small for use in oral lessons, but both these 
and the illustrations in Marshall’s Albums can be 
copied on blackboard or displayed upon the walls of 
the classroom before the lesson. 
4. Simple notes can be dictated or made by the 
children themselves at the end of each lesson. If made
-P-A-G-E-142
    
142 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
at intervals during the lessons they will mar the effect 
of the oral work. 
5. The lessons can also be followed up by simple 
oral or written exercises, which can be taken in the 
English lesson, or, if time allows, immediately after 
the oral work. 
6. Opportunities should also be found after each 
lesson for copying in note-books some of the simpler 
illustrations, e.g. sketches of costume and furniture. 
II. Tue RENAISSANCE 
Five lessons. (Age of children, 12-13.) 
Books for teacher’s preparation : 
J. B. Adams, Civilization during the Middle Ages, chap. xv. 
J. A. Symonds, Renaissance in Italy, vol. ii. 
H. A. L. Fisher, History of England, 1485-1547, chap. vi(Longmans).

Moberley, The Early Tudors (Longmans, 2s. 6d.). 
J. Burckhardt, The Renaissance in Italy (Allen, 10s. 6d.).   
First Lesson. The Revival of Learning 
1. Introduction. (a) Read to the class one of the 
stories from Kingsley’s Heroes. (b) Tell them the 
story of Leonidas at Thermopylae (C. M. Yonge, 
A Book of Golden Deeds). 
2. These and many other stories were not known in 
the Middle Ages as they came from Greek books. In 
the Middle Ages scholars could read Latin—this was the 
language of educated people for writing books and 
often for letters. But very few could read Greek. 
Also they had very few books written by the Greeks 
and Romans. These books were manuscripts, usually 
written on parchment. Many such books existed,  
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE ORAL LESSON 143 
which were far better than most of those read in the 
Middle Ages, but men in Western Europe were not 
aware of their existence. 
3. In the fourteenth century a famous man called 
Petrarch was living in Italy at the time Wyclif was 
living in England. He was one of the first to collect 
ancient Latin and Greek manuscripts. A copy of the 
works of Homer was sent to him from Constantinople, 
and he sent copyists to all parts of Europe to obtain 
copies of manuscripts whilst he himself copied many. 
One of his greatest disappointments was that a friend 
to whom he had lent a manuscript, pawned it. He 
encouraged rich men to form public libraries because 
of the difficulty in obtaining copies of the classics. 
4, Petrarch could read very little Greek, but before 
he died (1374) a few students in Italy were studying 
this language. As time went on, more Latin and Greek 
books were collected and studied. 
During this period the Turks were attacking Con- 
stantinople (class should refer to map of south-east 
Europe). In 1390 a Greek named Chrysoloras came to 
Italy to ask for help against the Turks. The Italians 
persuaded him to come again and make his home in 
Italy as a teacher of Greek when his business was 
finished. 
In the next century the number of Greek and Latin 
books in Italy increased by copying manuscripts, by 
the discovery of new works, and by Greek scholars 
bringing their manuscripts from Constantinople (taken 
by Turks 1453), A son-in-law of Chrysoloras was sent 
to Constantinople in 1422 to collect manuscripts; some 
of them were lost on the way to Italy in a shipwreck. 
5. Scholars began to go to Italy from England and 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  144 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
other countries to learn Greek and study the classics. 
In Henry VII’s reign it was being taught at Oxford 
and Cambridge; Henry VIII learnt it when young, 
and all his children had a classical education. 
Teaching Notes 
1. In teaching this subject it is very important to 
give particularfacts, which need not all be remembered, 
but which form the necessary foundation for more 
general ideas. 
2. During the lesson notes can be made at intervals 
by the children. 
3. After the lesson the class might be given an 
opportunity of reading extracts from translations of 
the classics, e.g. from North’s translation of Plutarch, 
from Thucydides, or from the Iliad or Odyssey. 
4, Written exercises such as a simple essay or 
answers to questions could be set in an English lesson, 
e.g. In what ways did Petrarch encourage the study 
of the classics? The value of such a question is that 
it demands real thought and not mere reproduction 
of facts. 
Second Lesson. Effects of the Revival of Learning 
Care must be taken in this lesson to avoid giving 
the children vague ideas about the abstract intellectual 
effects of the Revival. The first part of the lesson 
must deal with particular illustrations, after which a 
simple generalization might be developed. 
1. The idea that the earth is round was found in 
the classics and influenced the opinions of Columbus, 
leading him ultimately to sail westwards (Adams, 
Civilization inthe Middle Ages, pp. 388-9).
-P-A-G-E-145

THE ORAL LESSON 145 
2. Copernicus got his first ideas about the solar 
system from the ancients (Adams, p. 385). 
3. The Greeks knew more about medical science 
than physicians in the fifteenth century. Hence Greek 
medical works were translated. Linacre, an English 
Greek scholar, who was physician to Henry VII and 
Henry VIII, founded the Royal College of Physicians. 
4. There was much in the classics which made some 
men doubt the truth of the doctrines taught by the 
Church of Rome. Men began to think for themselves 
in matters of religion. The Renaissance in this way 
was one of the causes of the Reformation, which was 
a revolt against the authority of the Church. Teacher 
can refer to : 
(a) St. Paul at Athens, and the Altar to the Unknown 
God, as an illustration of the religious activity 
of the Greeks. Part of Acts, Chapter 17, can 
be read to class. 
(6) The worship of Plato by the scholars of Florence, 
who built a shrine in his honour and kept a lamp 
burning before his statue (see Symonds, pp.237-8). 
5. In England, however, the study of Greek turned 
men’s attention to the Bible. 
(a) Colet at Oxford ; his lectures on St. Paul. 
(b) Colet as Dean of St. Paul’s. In lectures and 
sermons he advocated a closer study of the 
Bible (see Seebohm, Ozford Reformers). 
6. Influence on education in England. Teacher 
hould first describe briefly the curriculum of a 
ediaeval school or university. He can then refer 
o the founding of colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, 
he building of grammar schools, and especially the 
ounding of St. Paul’s School (Oxford Reformers, chap. v).

Dictate extract A below. 
7. Conclusion. This will be arrived at by discussion 
with the class, The Revival of Learning resulted in 
men’s ideas about many things being changed. It 
made them doubt many things which had been believed 
for centuries to be true and made them dissatisfied 
with their knowledge. This doubt and dissatisfaction 
was the beginning of modern progress, 
Although the class will not, perhaps, be able to express 
these thoughts in these exact words, the aim of the 
teacher in this lesson is to give the children these ideas. 
Dictate extract B below. 
Teaching Notes 
1. Notes of the lesson will be taken as before. 
2. Note-books can also be used for extracts such as 
the following : 
A. From the Statutes of St. Paul’s School, quoted 
in Seebohm, Oxford Reformers, chap. v: ‘My intent 
is by this school specially to increase knowledge and 
worshipping of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and 
good Christian life and manners in the children.’ 
B. From a letter of Erasmus (Froude, Life and 
Letters of Erasmus, p. 244): ‘The world is waking out 
of along deep sleep. The old ignorance is still defended 
with tooth and claw, but we have kings and nobles now 
on our side. Time was when learning was only found 
in the religious orders. The religious orders nowadays 
care only for money and sensuality, while learning has 
passed to secular princes and peers and courtiers.’ 
In judging the truth of this extract we must make 
allowance for the fact that Erasmus was writing to 
one of Henry VIII's courtiers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
THE ORAL LESSON 147 
3. As in all lessons of this kind, the oral work and 
note-making can be followed by written exercises, 
e.g. write an account of a boy’s school life at St. Paul’s 
School in the reign of Henry VITI, 
Third Lesson. The Invention of Printing. 
Any good encyclopaedia for the facts connected with the history 
of printing. A good summary is found in the Official Guide to the 
British Museum (2d.). Tllustrations of manuscripts will be found 
in Traill and Mann, Social England, vol. ii, pp. 712-26; Brown, 
History of the English Bible (Cambridge Press, 1s.); and in guides to 
museums, e. g. Guide to Victoria and Albert Museum (London, 6d.). 
1, Introduction. Read to the class portions of 
Reade’s Cloister and the Hearth, chap. i—Gerard, the 
young copyist. 
2. Scarcity of books in mediaeval times; work of 
monks as copyists ; great cost of books. Show a copy— 
a coloured one ora photograph if possible—of an ancient 
manuscript to illustrate the beauty of the illustrations 
and lettering. 
3. The Revival of Learning caused a greater demand 
for books. At first the classics were copied by hand. 
‘Scarcity of books was at first a chief impediment to 
the study of antiquity. Popes and princes and even 
great religious institutions possessed far fewer books 
than many farmers of the present age’ (Symonds, p. 93). 
The demand for more copies of the classics did not, 
however, lead to the invention of printing, although it 
was a great cause of its rapid development. 
4, The introduction of printing. The details are 
not interesting to children and can be omitted. The 
following points, however, should be dealt with : 
(a) Invention of movable type. 
K2
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(6) Block printing—its advantages. Compare with 
stereotype plates. 
(c) The reasons why the art developed rapidly 
throughout Europe in latter part of fifteenth 
century. 
Illustrations of early printing should, if possible, be 
shown to the class. Refer to some great collections of 
early books such as that at the British Museum. 
5. First printing-presses in England. 
(a) Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde at Westminster. 
(b) Presses at Oxford and Cambridge. Show picture 
of an early printing-press. 
Teaching Notes 
Importance must be attached to the work done by 
the children after the lesson. The following exercises 
can be set : 
1. In an art lesson the children could copy a portion 
of an ancient manuscript if the lettering is artistic and 
legible and if the children are provided with suitable | 
pens. If an actual copy of a manuscript sufficiently 
clear to be copied cannot be supplied to the class, the 
teacher can let the children copy the lettering from the 
blackboard. 
2. In a handwork lesson the children could make 
blocks and take prints from them. Either a soft wood, 
e.g. canary, or linoleum with no surface can be used. 
3. Every school should have a hand printing-press, 
which will make this subject more interesting and give 
the children practice in actual printing, e.g. school 
notices, programmes, schemes of work, and also illus- 
trative extracts for the history lessons could be printed. 
4. A written exercise could also be set, e. g. ‘ Why was
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE ORAL LESSON 149 
the invention of printing one of the greatest events of 
the fifteenth century ?’ 
Fourth and Fifth Lessons. Life of Erasmus 
The following features of this period are illustrated 
by the life of Erasmus : 
1. The hardships of a poor scholar four hundred 
years ago. Contrast with the opportunities which 
a brilliant young man has to-day. 
2. The influence of the Revival of Learning upon 
religious thought. 
3. The degeneration of the Church on the eve of 
the Reformation. 
4. The Revival of Learning in England. 
Fourth Lesson. Erasmus, Early Life and 
Visits to England 
1. Introduction. Refer to extract from Reade’s 
Cloister and the Hearth which was read in the previous 
lesson. Gerard’s son became the famous Erasmus. 
2. His early life in a convent (Froude, Lecture 1). He 
was ever afterwards the bitter opponent of the monks. 
Read extracts from a letter written nearly thirty years 
later to the prior of this convent (Froude, pp. 176-8), 
and from a letter which illustrates his opinion of 
monastic orders in general (Froude, pp. 179-83). 
3. Life in Paris (Froude, Lecture 2). His first 
experience of the world. Though a priest, he mixed 
in gay society and was continually in need of money. 
Studied Greek and taught it. 
Read extract in which Erasmus describes a fight 
between his landlady and her maid. This will illustrate 
his humour (Froude, pp. 26-7). 
4. First visit to England, 1497-9 (Froude, Lecture 3).
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Was well received. A letter in which he speaks of the 
English girls being divinely pretty will reveal the lighter 
side of his nature and show that he was pleased with 
himself. ‘Your friend Erasmus gets on well in 
England’ (Froude, p. 49). He made many. friends, © 
including Colet, More, and Archbishop Warham. 
‘When Colet speaks I might be listening to Plato. 
Linacre is as deep and acute a thinker as I ever met 
with, Grocyn is a mine of knowledge, and Nature never 
formed a sweeter and happier disposition than that 
of Thomas More. The number of young men who are 
studying ancient literature is astonishing’ (Froude, 
pp. 43-4). 
His English friends provided him with funds to go 
to Italy. Visited the royal nursery, where he met the 
future Henry VIII. 
He was deprived of his money by the customs 
officials on leaving England. Why? Shortly after, 
he was again in Paris in great poverty. 
5. The next few years were spent abroad, with the 
exception of two short visits to England. During 
these years he was usually in great poverty. Read 
extracts in illustration, e.g. Froude, pp. 62, 64-5, 68-9. 
In one letter he declares: ‘No rock can be nakeder 
than I am at present’; and in another: ‘I must remain 
where Iam. I have no money and do not wish to 
borrow.’ But he was notaverse to begging and grumbling 
about his patrons when they disappointed him. 
On the whole, these were years of hard work, studying 
and translating Greek works (Froude, p. 63). 
6. Erasmus in England. Henry VIII, after his 
accession, invited Erasmus to England. On arrival in 
London he stayed with Moreand wrote his Praise of Folly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE ORAL LESSON 151 
Read extracts from this violent attack on the 
Church, e.g. his opinion of priests and friars (Froude, 
pp. 140-1) and of schoolmasters (Seebohm, chap. iv. 3). 
Erasmus became Professor of Greek at Cambridge: 
~ Whilst there he visited the shrine of Our Lady at 
Walsingham in Norfolk (Seebohm, chap. vii. 4). 
Fifth Lesson. Erasmus—his later years, 1514-36 
1. Whilst in England Erasmus was invited to the 
court of Prince Charles of the Netherlands (the future 
Emperor Charles V), who offered him a pension and 
remained his patron until the end of his life. 
Before leaving England he and Colet visited Becket’s 
shrine at Canterbury. Read to the class extracts from 
an account of this visit and of an incident on the return 
journey (Seebohm, chap. viii. 3). The details of the 
visit show the contempt of Erasmus and Colet for 
relics, images, and shrines. 
2. Publication of the Greek Testament with a new 
Latin translation. The importance of this was that 
it showed many faults in the Vulgate, the ‘authorized’ 
version of the Church. Since the Church considered 
the Vulgate to be without fault or blemish, the new 
Greek Testament and translation was bitterly attacked 
by Churchmen. 
3. The religious views of Erasmus. 
(a) He was bitterly opposed to degeneration in the 
Church, but— 
(b) He would not sever himself from it. In 1529 he 
wrote, ‘ Never will I be tempted or exasperated into 
deserting the true communion,’ and he never did. 
Indeed, in the last year of his life he might have received 
a cardinal’s hat.
-P-A-G-E-152
  
152 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(c) He advocated freedom of opinion in religious 
matters. ‘The sum of religion is peace, which can 
only be when definitions are as few as possible, and 
opinion is left free on many subjects ’ (Froude, p. 304). 
~~—-_He therefore was opposed to Luther, who whilst - 
attacking the doctrines of the Church was asserting new 
beliefs which might become as tyrannical as the old. 
(d) During the latter part of his life he showed an 
earnest Christian character. In 1529 he writes: ‘ All 
grows wilder and wilder. Men talk of heresy and 
orthodoxy . . . but none speak of Christ. . . . We have 
had prisons, bulls and burnings ; and what has come 
of them? Outcries enough; but no crying to Christ’ 
(Froude, p. 371). 
The children can form the above opinions, a-d, for 
themselves after extracts have been read to them. 
4. The great learning of Erasmus was recognized 
in his lifetime, and fortune smiled upon him. Read 
extracts from letters written in 1530 (Froude, p. 387) 
and in 1535 (Froude, p. 429). 
Teaching Notes 
1. These two lessons can be concluded by a discussion 
with the class concerning the character and influence 
of Erasmus. 
2. During the lessons the children’s note-books will 
be used for short extracts and notes. 
3. After the two lessons a short essay set to the class 
will encourage them to revise their notes and extracts. 
A few may even be able to refer to other books for 
material for the essay. Suitable subjects would be : 
(a) What Erasmus owed to England. 
(b) The character of Erasmus.
-P-A-G-E-153
  THE ORAL LESSON 153 
4. Ifa copy of Froude is available for class use, some 
of the children could be asked to collect short extracts 
in their note-books to illustrate such points as : 
(a) His hatred of the monks. 
(b) His poverty. 
(c) His love of pleasure. 
(d) His flattery of patrons. 
(e) His satire and wit. 
(f) His opinions on the Lutheran Reformation. 
5. The following two books can be recommended 
for private reading: Reade, Cloister and the Hearth ; 
Manning, Household of Sir Thomas More. 
II. Tur Growrs or tHE Enciish ParLiaMENT 
To 1295 
(Age of children, 14-15) 
Two lessons based upon the examination of sources. 
The class has already had lessons on : 
1. Government in tribal times—with special refer- 
ence to Tacitus. 
2. Local government in Saxon times ; the courts of 
the shire and hundred, their representative character. 
Before these lessons begin, the class is supplied with 
copies of the following extracts : 
A. From Alfred’s Dooms 
“I, then, Alfred, King, gathered these (laws) together, 
and commanded many of those to be written which 
our forefathers held, those which to me seemed good ; 
and many of those which seemed to me not good 
I rejected them, by the counsel of my “ witan”... 
I, then, Alfred, King of the West Saxons, shewed
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY © 
these to all my “ witan’’, and they then said that it 
seemed good to them all to be holden.’ + 
B. From the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 
“1085. At midwinter the King was at Gloucester 
with his witan ; and he held a court there five days. . . 
the King had a great consultation and spoke very 
deeply with his witan concerning the land, how it 
was held, and what were its tenantry.’ 
“1087. He (the King) wore his crown three times 
every year when he was in England : at Easter he wore 
it at Winchester, at Pentecost at Westminster, and at 
Christmas at Gloucester. And at these times all the 
men of England were with him, archbishops, bishops, 
abbots, and earls, thanes and knights.’ ® 
3 C. From Magna Carta 
Clause 14. ‘And for holding a common counsel 
of our realm we will cause to be summoned the arch- 
bishops, bishops, earls and greater barons, personally, 
by our letters ; and besides, we will cause to be sum- 
moned generally by our sheriffs and bailiffs, all who 
hold of us in chief, for a certain day, which shall be 
at least forty days ahead, and to a certain place ; and 
in all the letters of summons, we will state the cause 
of the summons ; and on the appointed day the business 
shall proceed according to the advice of those who shall 
be present, although all who have been summoned 
may not have come.’ *

    THE ORAL LESSON 155 
D. 
In 1254 King Henry III was in Gascony. The queen 
and Earl Richard, the king’s young brother, who were 
. regents of England in the king’s absence, sent a letter 
to all the sheriffs, of which the following is an extract : 
‘ The king to the sheriff of Bedfordshire and Bucking- 
hamshire, Greeting, 
... We straitly command you, that you cause to 
come before our council at Westminster on the fifteenth 
day after Easter next, four lawful and discreet knights 
from the said counties whom the said counties shall 
have chosen for this purpose, that is, two from one 
county and two from the other, who together with the 
knights from the other counties whom we have had 
summoned for the same day, shall arrange what aid 
they are willing to pay us in our need. And you your- 
self carefully set forth to the knights and others of 
the said counties, our need and how urgent is our 
business, and effectually persuade them to pay us an 
aid sufficient for the time being.’ * 
EL. Extract from a writ for the summoning of 
Parliament in 1295 
‘The King to the sheriff of Northamptonshire. 
Desiring to hold counsel and treat with the earls, barons 
and other nobles of our realm, as to provision against 
the perils which now threaten it, we have ordered them 
to meet us at Westminster, on the Sunday next follow- 
ing the Feast of St. Martin’s in the coming winter, to 
discuss, ordain and do whatever may be necessary 
to guard against this danger. We therefore firmly

-P-A-G-E-156
  156 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
enjoin you to have chosen without delay and sent to 
us at the said day and place two knights from the said 
county and two citizens from each city of the said 
county, and two burgesses from each borough, of those 
most discreet and powerful to achieve ; in such wise 
that the said knights, citizens and burgesses may 
severally have full and sufficient power, on behalf of 
themselves and the community of the county, cities 
and boroughs to do what may then be ordained by the 
common counsel,’ * 
Lesson I. The King’s Council 
(Extracts A, B, and C) 
Procedure : 
1. Reference to King Alfred’s work in collecting the 
laws of England. Read extracts from his collection 
(Kendall, pp. 17-20). 
2. Examination of Extract A. After extract has 
been read by class discuss : 
(a) The people summoned to the witenagemote. 
(b) Alfred’s reason for consulting his ‘ witan’ before 
publishing the laws. 
(c) Other matters upon which the king would 
consult them. 
Note on composition and functions of the witenage- 
mote made in note-books. 
3. Reference to: (a) the government after the Con- 
quest. William allowed the shire and hundred courts 
to continue ; (b) the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Like 
Alfred’s Dooms, it was written in Anglo-Saxon. 
4, Examination of Extract B. After both parts 
1 Reprinted by permission from Colby, Selections from the Sources 
of English History, p. 89 (Longmans).
-P-A-G-E-157
  
  THE ORAL LESSON 157 
have been carefully read, examine second part and 
discuss such questions as the following : 
(a) The classes of people who met the king three 
times a year (of course all the men of England were 
~ not with him). 
(b) The rank of these people. They were all tenants- 
in-chief. Teacher need not give an account of feudal 
tenure, but the children should know that all men who 
owed services directly to the king had the right of 
meeting him in council on the three occasions in the 
year. 
(c) Whether all the tenants-in-chief would be likely to 
gotoWinchester, Westminster, and Gloucester each year. 
Who would be the men most likely to stay away? 
(d) Whether the king would consult his great men 
only onthese three occasions. The truth probably isthat 
he always had a number of tenants-in-chief and officials 
around him, forming a small permanent council. 
Now examine the first part (date 1085) and discuss : 
(a) The exact questions upon which King William 
‘spoke very deeply with his witan’. 
(6) Why he should want full information about the 
landowners of England, their services, and to whom 
they owed these services (services can be explained as 
the equivalent of rent). 
(c) The outcome of this meeting with his witan or 
great council. An inquiry was made throughout the 
country—Domesday Survey. 
Notes made on above points. 
5. Reference to Magna Carta and the circumstances 
under which it was extorted from the king. 
6. Tell children that in the Charter there were certain. 
things the king promised not to do, without the
-P-A-G-E-158
158 © THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
‘common counsel’ of the realm. Now examine 
Extract C and discuss these points: 
(a) Who had a right to receive a personal summons 
from the king (note phrase ‘greater barons’; all 
tenants-in-chief were called ‘ barons’). 
(b) Why personal letters were not sent to all tenants- 
in-chief, 
(c) Whether the lesser tenants-in-chief would be 
likely to go. 
_ Note made by class on the composition of the king’s 
council in 1215, emphasizing the distinction between 
the greater and the lesser barons. 
Lesson II. The Beginning of Representation 
(Extracts D and E) 
1, Discuss the following points or let the class study 
them from their books if text-books are available : 
(a) Why King Henry III was at war with France 
in 1254, 
(6) How the king raised money for the war. 
(c) Why the war was unpopular with the people of 
England, 
(d) Why the nobles, when asked for an aid, sug- 
gested that representatives of the people should be 
summoned, 
2. Now read Extract D and discuss such points as : 
(a) The reason for the Council being held at West- 
minster. 
(b) Meaning of ‘ lawful and discreet ’. 
(c) Method of choosing the knights. 
(d) Whether the king would be likely to get the 
money he wanted. (In 1253 Henry had ‘ confirmed ’ 
the Charter, but had quickly ignored his promise. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
    
THE ORAL LESSON 159 
only result of the summoning of the knights in 1254 
was the presentation of a list of grievances.) 
3. Discuss these points or let class study them from 
their books : 
(a) What led up to Simon de Montfort’s rebellion 
of 1264. 
(b) Why Simon called the Parliament of 1265. 
(c) How the people of England were represented 
in this Parliament. 
(d) Whether de Montfort is entitled to be called the 
‘ Founder of the English House of Commons’. 
4. Refer to Edward I’s difficulties in 1295. 
(a) War with France. Class need not know exact 
events leading to this war. 
(b) Trouble with Scotland. 
(c) Revolts in Wales. 
Hence need for a complete Parliament to support 
him at this time. 
5. Now read Extract E. The class need not study 
the representation of the clergy, as this is of antiquarian 
interest alone and does not affect the composition of 
Parliament to-day. 
Discuss the following points : 
(a) Why Edward would bemore likely than Henry III 
to get the money he wanted. 
(6) In what way the people were more completely 
represented in this Parliament than in 1254 or 1265. 
(c) Whether this representation, which lasted with 
little change until 1832, was quite satisfactory in 1295. 
Whether there were any classes not represented in 1295. 
(d) In 1295 there was only one House of Parliament. 
The representatives of the [people were summoned 
to join the nobles of the Council.

  160 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Teaching Notes 
1. Note-books must be frequently used for important 
facts. , 
2. The time taken for these two lessons, especially 
if some of the work is done in private study and each 
point suggested above is dealt with fully, will probably 
be considerably more than two lesson periods. The 
rate of progress will depend entirely upon the teacher. 
3. The best form of revision is not oral questioning, 
but a series of written answers. If such questions as 
the following are set, the children must carefully revise 
‘their knowledge, using note-book and text-book. 
These questions are not merely reproductive, but in 
most cases demand the arrangement of knowledge in 
a systematic way. 
(a) Compare the Saxon Witenagemote with the 
present House of Lords. 
(6) Give a description of the Council in 1295 to which 
were added the representatives of the people. 
(c) Our English form of government has grown in 
a natural way to meet real needs as they arise. Explain 
this by referring to Parliament in the thirteenth 
century ? 
(d) Can you account for the fact that the House of 
Commons has control of the money matters of govern- 
ment ? ~ 
(e) In 1295 there was one House of Parliament. 
Can you explain why it later divided into two ?
-P-A-G-E-161
  CHAPTER X 
LEARNING BY DOING—YOUNGER PUPILS 
In the past we have erred in the teaching of history 
by denying to the child an active share in the work. 
We have too often forgotten that knowledge is best 
retained when it has been gained by effort; that as 
a general rule it is not what the teacher does for the 
child, but what the child does for himself, which counts 
in education; not the knowledge which is crammed 
into the child, but that gained through his activities, 
which has a permanent effect. We have also forgotten 
that the process of acquiring knowledge is not com- 
plete until the knowledge has been expressed in some 
active form. It follows that the children’s work has 
two aims, the acquisition of knowledge, and the 
revision and fixing of knowledge previously acquired. 
The means by which the children can gather the 
facts of history for themselves are the study of books 
and the examination of sources. But there are draw- 
backs to these methods. Such work is often too 
difficult for children ; suitable books are rarely found 
in the school in sufficient numbers to make private 
study possible; and there are few sources, docu- 
mentary or otherwise, which will yield a reasonable 
amount of knowledge upon examination by the 
children. The class, then, must inevitably lose, to 
a great extent, the benefit which comes through 
acquiring knowledge by active effort. We must, after 
1977 Li 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
all, fall back upon the oral lesson as the chief means 
of imparting the facts of history. 
Oral work, however, must be followed by active 
exercises for the purpose of revising and organizing 
this knowledge. In the upper classes we must also ~ 
precede or follow up the oral lesson, whenever possible, 
with the study of books and sources. Our aim is to 
combine oral work and children’s activities, for each is 
supplementary of the other. Without sufficient oral 
work, the child’s knowledge is narrow and frag- 
mentary ; without active exercises it is transitory 
and vague, unorganized, and ill-assimilated. Active 
work by the class in which the children use their 
knowledge has a further value, in being the only 
means by which the teacher is able to-judge the success 
of his teaching. A rapid question-and-answer review at 
the end of the oral lesson is of little value in showing how 
far the children have really understood the facts taught. 
In this chapter those exercises will be discussed 
which are most suitable for younger children. In the 
next we shall consider those forms of active work 
which are more fitting for the upper classes. 
The exercises for young children which can follow 
an oral lesson include handwork, simple art work, 
dramatization, and simple oral and written work. 
These will be considered in turn. 
I. Hanpwork anp ART 
Historical subjects provide an unlimited range of 
exercises in both handwork and art. These vary 
considerably in their nature and value. 
(a) Simple imitative exercises in art, e.g. copying 
sketches of (1) historical objects, as armour, costumes,
-P-A-G-E-163
  LEARNING BY DOING 163 
or articles of furniture ; (2) scenes of everyday life, as 
an attack on a mediaeval castle or farming in the 
Middle Ages (sketches from the Luttrell Psalter show- 
ing ploughing, sowing, reaping, and carting, are repro- 
duced in Marshall’s Historical Albums, 1272-1399, iv) ; 
(3) illustrations of architecture, such as a Norman castle 
or an Elizabethan manor-house. 
These exercises are useful in emphasizing the form 
of an object or the details of common events, since 
a more lasting impression is made on the mind than if 
the sketch were only observed by the children. 
(b) Exercises in artinvolving more freedom and effort, 
e.g. sketching or modelling in clay historical objects 
which are before the class. Such exercises are suit- 
able for children of all ages, and need not be restricted 
to the lower classes. It is usually difficult to obtain 
historical objects as illustrations which can be sketched 
in the classroom. But in almost every locality there 
are historical remains which can be visited and sketched 
by the children. In some towns, indeed, as York, 
Norwich, and Exeter, these remains are so numerous 
that they will provide work for a considerable number 
of art lessons. For example, at York there are the 
minster and parish churches, the walls and bars, the 
Roman Tower, the remains of St. Mary’s Abbey, and 
typical examples of domestic architecture, besides the 
museum with its rich store of relics. Whenever the 
children visit a museum or place of interest for 
the purpose of studying historical illustrations a few 
sketches should be made in note-books. As an aid to 
the study of history such art exercises are more 
valuable than merely copying a sketch, since they 
require a close examination of the object itself. 
L2  
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(c) Making models in clay, cardboard, or wood from 
the actual object or a teaching model. These hand- 
work exercises, like the copying of sketches, are 
essentially imitative, but vary considerably in the 
difficulties of construction involved. Even a very 
young child can make a clay model of a Greek helmet 
from a large size model which the teacher has made. 
In some other cases the exercises are only suitable for 
older children because of the skill required, e. g. copying 
a model of a hand-loom or a Tudor man-of-war. 
(d) The exercises in art and handwork which require 
the greatest amount of originality and effort are the 
construction of models and the making of drawings 
from pictures, sketches, and verbal descriptions. T'wo 
examples may be given of this kind of exercise. I have 
told the story of the battle of Hastings to children 
seven years old, and at the end I ask the class to show 
me as much as they can of the battle by using their 
clay. Many will construct a reasonably good model. 
A hill is made, soldiers of the two armies are fixed up, 
some, who are dead, are lying down, whilst the greater 
number of the English lying down indicates the victory 
of the Normans. In such cases some of the main 
points of the story are plainly expressed. But shape- 
less lumps of clay represent the soldiers. The model 
is crude, it is symbolic. The child’s lack of skill and 
the limitations of his material have impeded the work 
of expression, and the model is by no means a replica 
of his mental picture. Butitis of some use. The child, 
in making it, has revised his knowledge, and his interest 
in the subject has been increased through his having 
been actively employed in making something. 
On the other hand, a pastel drawing of an historical
-P-A-G-E-165
  LEARNING BY DOING 165 
scene should rarely be required from the children, 
since it is more difficult to make and even less satis- 
factory than a clay model. We are, indeed, inclined 
to overrate the value of these so-called expression 
exercises, both in handwork and art. The lack of skill 
effectually hinders the expression of real historical 
ideas, and too often the result is the crudest imaginable 
travesty of the event itself. 
The second example is taken from the workshop of 
a secondary school. The boys are going to make a 
model of a Norman abbey or a feudal castle, and not 
having seen a model of such a building will need 
guidance. They will read books on the architecture 
of abbeys and castles, will visit many ruins in the 
neighbourhood which will help them in making their 
models, and will get hints from their history master. 
All this helps them to have a fuller conception of an 
abbey or castle, but it does not enable them to imitate, 
except in part. They must, from the knowledge 
gained, mentally reconstruct the building, and then 
express their conception in wood and cardboard. 
In these exercises, which require some originality 
of treatment, there is sometimes a tendency on the 
part of teachers to think that the value of such work 
is in proportion to the degree of freedom and originality 
which it displays. This is especially the case in teach- 
ing young children. But the result of unduly empha- 
sizing the importance of originality in treatment is 
that historical accuracy is in danger of being neglected. 
The teacher recognizes the evil of servile imitation, but 
forgets that imitation is essential for progress, and is 
the foundation of a great part of the work in school. 
There is, it is true, a natural tendency for imitation
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
to become thoughtless and mechanical. But the 
remedy for this is not to deprecate imitative exercises 
and place a premium upon ‘original’ work, but to 
prevent imitation becoming mechanical. 
The aim of all the above exercises is to make man’s 
life in past ages more real to the child. Making a model 
or drawing of some historical object or scene does not, 
however, by itself necessarily help him. If his atten- 
tion is so concentrated upon the technique of the work 
that the historical nature of the exercise is lost to him, 
then it has no value as an aid to the understanding 
of history. In the child’s mind the object must remain 
in its historical setting as it is being made or drawn. 
Professor Dewey thinks that ‘when a pupil learns by 
doing, he is re-living, both mentally and physically, 
some experience which has proved important to the 
human race; he goes through the same mental pro- 
cesses as those who originally did these things’. But 
this does not always happen. 
On the other hand, the mistake can be made of 
concentrating the whole attention upon the historical 
ideas of the exercise, and neglecting the technique of 
the work. This is sometimes the case in the expression 
work of lower classes. In some lessons in handwork 
and art the teachers insist upon sound work, and in the 
freer expression lessons their labour is lost through 
inattention to the quality of the work. When the 
child fails, not through lack of care, but through lack 
of skill, to produce work that is even moderately 
sound, then there is a grave suspicion that the exercise 
is unsuitable.

II. DramatizATIoN 
The acting of historical scenes may be either extem- 
poraneous or prepared. 
(a) We have already seen that in handwork, and. 
occasionally in art, we may give the class what have 
been called expression exercises, in which the children 
have considerable freedom in expressing their ideas. 
Such exercises test the children’s knowledge and give 
the teacher an opportunity of correcting misconcep- 
tions. At, the same time they are a means of revision, 
and often lead to greater definiteness of knowledge. 
Unprepared dramatization may be compared with 
such exercises. But it is far more difficult for the 
children to accomplish satisfactorily, since premedita- 
tion is hardly possible., The acting, to be natural, 
must proceed without llegitiation ; the child cannot 
pause to arrange his ideas and determine the exact 
mode in which he can best express them. More mental 
activity, then, is evidently needed than in any other 
form of exercise. The young child—such dramatization 
is usually limited to lower classes—is required, in | 
a novel position before an audience, to concentrate his 
thoughts, rapidly review the knowledge acquired 
during the oral lesson, make the necessary selection 
from the knowledge so reviewed, and express himself 
clearly and without hesitation in spoken words. It is 
no wonder that the child breaks down and all thought 
of acting is lost. 
If a number of children are engaged in performing 
a scene, there is the further difficulty of each one being 
able to judge exactly when he must play his part. 
And even if the actors are able to express themselves
-P-A-G-E-168
  168 ‘THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
fluently and clearly and are able to take up their parts 
at the right time, there may be very little real acting. 
It is sometimes assumed that because children are 
‘born actors’ and have a ‘dramatic instinct’, their 
attempts to dramatize stories must naturally be 
successful and have an educational value. But 
a child’s dramatic instinct is essentially imitative. 
A very young child will often do something quite 
spontaneously in imitation of another’s action. Later 
on, he will develop a tendency to go through a series 
of actions which he has seen another perform, such as 
when boys play at being soldiers and girls at keeping 
school. In every case the children have seen or heard 
of people acting in a particular way and are prompted 
to copy them by their instinct of imitation. The 
children cannot dramatize without a model of some 
kind. They need not always have actually seen 
similar actions performed, but the incidents which 
they are expected to dramatize must have been pre- 
sented to them in a dramatic form. The teacher, then, 
can do something to ensure real dramatic action on 
the part of the children. If his manner and voice 
during the story-telling have been dramatic, and the 
pictures illustrating the story are dramatic in character, 
then the children are helped considerably. 
There are other ways, apart from making the 
presentation of the story dramatic, by which the 
teacher can do something to ensure the success of 
dramatic efforts. In the oral part of the lesson the 
children must have acquired sufficient knowledge to 
enable them to imagine clearly the incidents related, 
as children cannot act a scene of which they have only 
an inadequate conception. The incidents selected for - 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  LEARNING BY DOING 169 
dramatization must be simple and vigorous ; a battle 
scene can hardly be successful, since there is no oppor- 
tunity for dialogue and the movements in most cases 
were complicated, and extended over a considerable 
space of time. The battle of Hastings in the classroom, 
where the combatants can only give a few cuts and 
thrusts and settle the dispute in three minutes is, even 
for a child, probably robbed of all the reality of the 
scene itself. In such a case the story told by the 
teacher with the aid of good illustrations would be 
better without any attempt at dramatization. 
When the children have been selected, the teacher 
must make them clearly understand their parts by 
rapidly reviewing the main points of the story. The 
actors will then be not altogether unprepared. There 
must, moreover, be ample space in the classroom and 
ample time for the acting. An attempt made during 
the last few minutes of a lesson is doomed to failure. 
Even with careful preparation there will be awkward 
pauses, and the teacher must not expect the acting to 
proceed smoothly without his constant assistance. 
If the teacher is able to overcome the many diffi- 
culties, it is still a very crude representation of the real 
scene. Unsympathetic spectators would be inclined 
to ridicule it and be sceptical as to its value in teaching. 
But we must remember that to the children, both 
audience and actors, the acting is much more real than 
to us, who are older and more critical. The young 
child’s rude model of the battlefield of Hastings may 
not be satisfactory, even to him. He may be dimly 
aware that it is imperfect. But he cannot discern 
with a clear eye its imperfections. It is to him much 
more a representation of the real scene than it can
-P-A-G-E-170
    170 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
possibly be to us. So it is with the children’s dramatic 
attempts. To the children themselves they are by 
no means crude; the imperfections of action and 
speech are ignored, and the interest is concentrated, 
as we want it to be, on the movement. 
Where a teacher is able to provide any stage proper- 
ties the interest is increased, as children take delight 
in dressing up. Costumes of other periods, arms and 
armour, are a great attraction, and as illustrations 
no doubt help towards the better realization of a scene. 
When such articles are not merely handled by the 
teacher as illustrations, but are used in the course of 
dramatic action, the child is helped still further to 
form a true picture of the event. 
(b) After an historical incident has been enacted 
under the guidance of the teacher the children may 
like to repeat it, as they have become more acquainted 
with their parts. In some cases, through constant 
repetition, a little play is evolved from what was at 
first extemporaneous acting. In other cases the chil- 
dren can learn a short play which has been written 
by some members of the class, or by the teacher, or is 
published in one of the many collections of historical 
plays for children. In upper classes the children can 
sometimes learn with profit a scene from some historical 
play, as those of Shakespeare. In all these cases the 
dramatization can be compared with imitative exercises 
in handwork and art. The children follow a set form 
of words which they have learnt and perform a definite 
series of actions. Unlike the unprepared dramatic 
efforts which follow an oral lesson, these little plays 
and dramatic extracts are not expressive of the chil- 
dren’s ideas on the topic, although they are not, on
-P-A-G-E-171
  LEARNING BY DOING 171 
this account, without value. They are often an aid in 
making history more realistic by presenting a situation 
or the character of a person in a clearer light; but 
they must, after all, be considered mainly recreative 
in character. Their performance may give great 
pleasure, both to actors and audience, but so much 
time must be spent in preparation that they cannot be 
of much value in history teaching. 
III. Oran anp Written Work 
A variety of exercises of this nature are possible with 
younger children. 
1. Note-books can be used after a lesson for construct- 
ing simple lines of time, for copying brief notes of facts 
which will be of permanent value in the children’s 
historical study, and for short original extracts and 
historical poems which illustrate the oral work. 
2. The poems can sometimes be learnt by heart and 
recited in class.* 
3. When a story or description has been given in 
an oral lesson, the teacher can require its reproduction, 
either orally by individual children, or as a written 
exercise by the whole class. The attempts are almost 
inevitably crude, but useful purposes are served. On 
the one hand, the children have practice in the use of 
the English language as a medium of expression ; 
whilst, on the other, the reproduction in a connected 
form of the main ideas of an historical narrative 
preserves the unity of the story when revising it. 
There is, however, a drawback to these exercises, 
which has already been noticed in connexion with 
handwork, art, and dramatization. Because of the 
1 For suitable collections of poems see p. 192,  
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
great freedom which the children have in the selection 
and arrangement of ideas, they will often reproduce 
unimportant details and place the facts in their wrong 
perspective. Essentials will be omitted and incidental 
facts magnified in importance. It is, then, sometimes - 
advisable to give the children a narrower field of work. 
For example, instead of asking them to give an account 
of Drake’s voyage to America, 1572-3, they could 
answer the following questions : 
(a) In what ways is a sea voyage safer and more 
comfortable to-day than in the time of Drake ? 
(6) Do you think Drake would be satisfied with his 
exploits of 1572-3? Give reasons. 
(c) Why do we consider Drake a very brave man ? 
Such written answers, even if brief, are far better 
than the usual question-and-answer method of revision. 
They ensure that every child makes an attempt to 
recall his knowledge and use it. There is also more 
scope for individual effort than in oral questioning, 
where the children are continually stimulated by the 
questions dealing with single points and requiring 
answers in a few words. 
Whenever possible, this work should be reserved for 
separate lessons. Even when the teacher’s story or 
description ends a few minutes before the close of the 
lesson period, the children usually wish to ask ques- 
tions and make comments on the lesson. A formal 
reproduction by the children, either oral or written, 
would then be irksome and quite out of place.
-P-A-G-E-173
CHAPTER XI 
LEARNING BY DOING—OLDER PUPILS 
In the past, the children have been given far too 
much help in their work. Especially in those lessons 
which involve the imparting of knowledge, the teacher 
has not spared himself in making the road to learning 
as easy as possible for his pupils. ‘Children once used 
to learn a lesson and say it to the teacher, whereas 
nowadays the teacher learns the lesson and says it 
to the children.’ To-day, however, he is realizing 
that in subjects which involve the acquisition of 
knowledge, the success of his teaching is judged, not 
by the number of facts the children can remember, 
but by the development of interest and understanding. 
(In history, particularly, the ability to recall facts is 
“of little value compared with the historical attitude 
of mind which we hope to cultivate in our pupils.) In 
the upper classes we want to give them the power of 
going on by themselves when the help of the teacher 
is no longer available. 
This change in view is leading to a change in methods. 
The oral lesson must still remain the foundation of 
history teaching, but as far as possible the teacher 
becomes the guide of the children’s active work, 
rather than the source of all knowledge. The children 
use their eyes and hands, rather than their ears, and 
are given something to do, rather than something to 
1 Pp. A, Barnett, Common Sense in Teaching, p. 19.
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
listen to. Much of this active work which is done by 
older pupils is concerned with the acquisition of 
historical knowledge. Books can be studied, where 
a library is available, and the general literature of 
a period can be read to illustrate the history of that 
period. Sources can be examined, even without the 
use of a library, although better use will be made of 
them if they can be interpreted with the aid of modern 
historical works. Lastly, written exercises can be set 
to test the pupils’ knowledge. These points will be 
considered in detail. 
I. Private Srupy 
If the children have a general text-book, the teacher 
can set topics to be studied as a preparation for oral 
work, in which case interest will be created in the subject 
and preparation made for the oral lesson. Or, after 
a lesson, questions and topics can be set in order 
that the knowledge gained may be revised and extended. 
Where a library is available, either a small collection 
of history books in the classroom, or a school library 
of larger works, the children need not all study the same 
topic. They can have subjects allotted to them or 
can select them for themselves from a list supplied by 
the teacher. In this way certain children might be 
encouraged to develop into recognized class authorities 
on particular topics. _ 
It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of 
private study in upper classes. The children have a 
feeling of pride and self-reliance through having gained 
something by their own efforts; they are being trained 
in gaining knowledge from books ; and the facts learnt 
are more deeply impressed upon their minds.
-P-A-G-E-175
  LEARNING BY DOING 175 
But there are serious hindrances to successful work 
of this kind. Unless it is carefully supervised much 
time is inevitably wasted and energy misdirected. 
The teacher can be helpful by giving a list of the most 
useful books and a series of questions to be answered 
which will guide the children’s reading and help them 
to organize the knowledge acquired. Notes can be 
made in note-books as the private reading proceeds, 
and these can afterwards be worked up into written 
answers and essays. But even when the teacher 
carefully indicates the books to be studied and the 
work to be done, there is often much time spent with 
little apparent result. Young students, even with the 
aid of suggested questions, are often unable to grasp 
rapidly the contents of a passage, judge of its impor- 
tance, and extract the relevant facts. These drawbacks 
reveal, not the futility of private study, but the neces- 
sity for careful supervision and for supplementing it 
with oral work. Improvement will come through 
increased experience of private study together with 
careful criticism by the teacher of note-books and the 
written answers and essays. 
The first essential for successful work of this kind is, 
however, a good supply of books. But a good working 
library is by no means a conspicuous feature of most 
schools, even at the present time. The historical 
literature of the elementary schools is too often limited 
to historical readers of varying quality; whilst in 
many secondary schools the only books available are 
a deadly dull text-book and a collection of historical 
works too small and limited in scope to be extensively 
used by the pupils. 
In elementary schools the histerteal reader in the
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
lower classes is useful in supplementing the stories told 
by the teacher. In the upper classes the reading 
lessons are devoted to three purposes—to cultivate 
the much neglected art of reading aloud, to encourage 
a habit of reading good books, and to acquire informa- 
tion on a particular topic. The first aim can be pursued 
in special elocution lessons. The second can be the 
purpose of silent reading lessons, better termed literature 
lessons, in which the children read books of literary 
value, yet simple enough to be interesting. The third 
purpose, the acquisition of knowledge, especially in 
history and geography, is an important aim of reading 
lessons in upper classes. Such lessons, devoted to 
reading ‘for information’, are better time-tabled as 
history or geography lessons; and would be more 
useful if the time were spent in systematic private 
study. At present, however, the reader is usually 
the only book, apart from those lent by teachers or 
borrowed from outside sources, which can be used for 
study. It ought, therefore, to have a close connexion 
with the syllabus of work for the year. But history 
readers date from a time when history was not yet 
included in the curriculum of the elementary school. 
Without making it a school subject an attempt was 
made to give some historical information by introducing 
readers. These were too often confined to political 
history, told in the form of disconnected stories, a fault 
which to some extent they have retained. As the reader 
in very many schools has been made the basis of work, 
and the scheme drawn up in reference to it, the short- 
comings of the reader have been reflected in the oral 
work. Where, on the other hand, teachers have 
ignored the reader in making a scheme, the one class-
-P-A-G-E-177
  LEARNING BY DOING 177 
book which could be used as a source for historical 
facts is rendered practically useless. 
Our main conclusions are, therefore : 
(1) Historical readers for upper classes should be 
-used principally for private study; (2) the subject- 
matter must be in agreement with the scheme of work 
for the year. Such books may be easy text-books on 
selected topics, which show clearly and vividly some 
of the lines of development studied during the year, 
or may be illustrative collections to amplify the oral 
work. In this latter case, if they contain numerous 
pictorial illustrations, typical extracts from original 
sources, great historians and historical novels, together 
with historical poems and occasional well-written 
chapters on subjects of importance, then they will be 
of great use for reference and private study. Such a 
book must be a carefully gathered collection of material 
bearing directly upon the year’s work. Whatever the 
kind of book chosen, it should contain references to 
other suitable books, Lastly, it must contain nothing 
dull or commonplace, but by its freshness should in- 
crease the child’s interest and his desire for further 
reading. 
Suitable text-books on selected topics which are 
included in the scheme for the year are not easy to 
obtain ; and it is almost impossible to find a satisfactory 
compendium. of illustrative material. Some teachers 
have therefore discarded altogether the text-book 
type of historical reader which can be used for private 
study and have, perhaps wisely, adopted books of a 
rather different nature; either (1) editions of histori- 
cal classics, as Captain Cook’s voyages, extracts from 
Hakluyt or Prescott, the adventures of Captain John 
1977 M
-P-A-G-E-178
  178 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Smith, or Burke’s speeches on America, or (2) historical 
tales such as those of Herbert Strang, or (3) collections 
of scenes from: historical romances. 
In secondary schools the general text-book of national 
history is useful in supplying many historical facts 
in handy form, but is of little value in giving boys an 
idea of historical development in any direction. It 
can be used as a summary for purposes of revision or 
as a source from which to get the skeleton facts of 
history ; but the young student who resorts to it in 
order to gain a preliminary view of a subject is harassed. 
by its generalizations and confused by its disconnected 
method of treatment. As a summary for purposes 
of revision its value is lessened by its lack of continuity 
in dealing with any particular phase of national develop- 
ment. Its generalizations are often illuminating to one 
who has already mastered the main facts of history, 
but have no meaning for the raw schoolboy requiring 
a storehouse of particular facts and vivid details. Any 
general text-book is therefore inevitably defective, 
especially if confined to a single volume. The best 
general history for schools is one in several volumes, 
each volume being devoted to some period or phase of 
national development. Many important matters must 
be omitted, but those included should be treated 
adequately; that is, the text-book should be some- 
thing more than a collection of summaries. It should 
be illustrated, since large historical illustrations are 
expensive and difficult to obtain; and it should 
indicate a few of the most accessible sources and con- 
tain references to larger books. ‘One type of a bad 
school-book is a book that explains everything.’ + 
1 P. A. Barnett, Common Sense in Education, p. 190.
-P-A-G-E-179
  LEARNING BY DOING 179 
Besides the class-books every school should have an 
historical library. It is to be hoped that the time will 
come when a good working library will be considered 
as essential a part of the equipment of any elementary 
or secondary school as desks, exercise books or scientific 
apparatus. Such a library should contain the standard 
histories of England; books on special subjects, as 
the economic, social, military and naval history of 
England, the history of the United States, of Europe, 
of ancient Greece and Rome, besides the history of 
maritime expansion, of colonization, and of trade ; 
well-chosen classics and collections of sources; and 
books of illustrations such as Lavisse and Parmentier’s 
Album Historique and historical atlases. The value 
of such a library in the elementary school will perhaps 
be questioned, but we should remember that these 
books are essential to every enthusiastic teacher and 
that most teachers are unable to purchase many of 
them for themselves. The older pupils also by using 
books will receive a training in private study, and will 
find much to interest and profit them, even in some of 
the more difficult books, if their work is carefully 
supervised. In every secondary school a library is 
indispensable. Yet it is the exception to find a school 
authority so enlightened as to provide one of adequate 
size. The fact that in many cases pupils can borrow 
books from a public library does not, of course, remove 
the necessity for a school library. Each class should 
also be encouraged to form its own little collection of 
smaller books. This may not be of much direct value 
in teaching but will, nevertheless, be the source of 
much general historical knowledge, and will make 
the children accustomed to the use of books.

180 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
II. Tue Usr or Sources 
The sources of history are the raw materials from 
which the historian reconstructs the Past. Most of 
these are in the form of writing and may therefore 
be termed documentary sources. Occasionally customs 
and traditions, place-names and common words, 
monuments, buildings and ruins are the source of 
important knowledge. For example, the antiquary 
learns much about life in a monastery by studying 
the ruined abbeys of England ; an Egyptian pyramid 
or a Norman cathedral speaks to us of the skill of its 
builders and their religious ideals; the work of the 
Romans in Britain is revealed, in the absence of written 
accounts, by the remains of buildings, roads and camps, 
and in the names of places. The chief sources are, 
however, written records, and we shall at this place 
confine our attention to these. 
Material remains, customs, and names will be con- 
sidered later as illustrations. 
Written sources include official documents such as 
state papers, official correspondence, Acts of Parlia- 
ment, and local records; legal documents such as 
charters ; private documents such as diaries and private 
correspondence ; together with contemporary memoirs 
and lives, chronicles, political pamphlets, and a whole 
mass of miscellaneous literature. To these can be added 
inscriptions which are of the first importance in ancient 
history. This is the range of material from which an 
energetic teacher is able to select his sources. The 
documents dealing with even a single period or event 
are, however, so varied. in character and immense in 
extent, so contradictory in their evidence and often
-P-A-G-E-181
  
  LEARNING BY DOING 181 
so difficult to the child mind, that when teaching, 
we are only able to use very few in comparison 
with those which are laid under contribution by an 
historian. 
Sources are either contemporary or post-contempor- 
ary. Contemporary documents should, in the nature 
of things, be of more value. But later records, written 
when the event can be viewed in perspective with 
other events, and when evidence can be collected and 
sifted, often give a more accurate account. Contem- 
porary sources are often marred by prejudice, as in 
the case of Polydore Vergil’s Historia Anglica. This 
work is the most important source for the reign of 
Henry VII, but ‘the last book, devoted to the early 
years of the reign of Henry VIII, is vitiated by a violent 
detestation of Wolsey, who threw the author into 
prison ’.? 
Post-contemporary writings also vary much in value. 
Sometimes, as in the case of early history, they are 
the main source of our knowledge. Livy’s History, 
in the absence of contemporary sources, is of the first 
importance for the early history of Rome. Gildas, 
Nennius, and Bede are our main sources for the facts 
of the English invasions. These, then, are original 
authorities, although not contemporary. On the 
other hand, some post-contemporary writings, such as 
Bacon’s History of Henry VII, are only secondary 
authorities. ‘In almost every case we can refer to 
the original authorities which formed the basis for 
Bacon’s statements, and find that, with unimportant 
exceptions, we possess all these authorities themselves.’

182 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
This, however, does not lessen the value of Bacon’s : 
Henry VII for use in school. 
Sources may be resorted to before an oral lesson, 
and preliminary exercises set which will involve their 
examination ; they may be used during the lesson or 
may be studied afterwards in the light of the knowledge 
gained during the lessons. 
(1) The study of sources before a lesson is valuable, 
as all preliminary private study is valuable, for creating 
an interest in a topic and giving a foundation of facts. 
Suppose, for example, the teacher intends to give 
a lesson on the introduction of the English Bible into 
the Church. The class, some time before the lesson, 
could be provided with the following two extracts: 
(a) From a Royal Injunction of 1536 * 
“Every person or proprietary of any parish church 
within this realm shall, on this side of the feast of 
St. Peter next coming, provide a book of the whole 
Bible both in Latin and also in English, and lay the 
same in the quire, for any man that will to read and 
look therein ; and shall discourage no man from the 
reading any part of the Bible, but rather comfort, 
exhort, and admonish every man to read the same, 
as the very word of God and the spiritual food of man’s 
soul . . . ever gently and charitably exhorting them, 
that, using a sober and modest behaviour in the reading 
and inquisition of the true sense of the same, they do 
in nowise stiffly or eagerly contend or strive one with 
another about the same, but refer the declaration of 
those places that be in controversy to the judgment 
of them that be better learned.’ 
1 Kendall, Source Book of English History, p. 144.
-P-A-G-E-183
LEARNING BY DOING 183 
(6) From a Statute of 1542+ 
‘The Bible shall not be read in English in any 
church. No women or artificers, prentices, journey- 
men, servingmen of the degree of yeomen or under, 
husbandmen, or labourers, shall read the New Testa- 
ment in English. Nothing shall be taught or main- 
tained contrary to the King’s instructions. And if 
any spiritual person preach, teach or maintain any- 
thing contrary to the King’s instructions or determina- 
tions, made or to be made, and shall be thereof convict, 
he shall for his first offence recant, for his second 
abjure and bear a fagot, and for his third shall be 
adjudged an heretick, and be burned and lose all his 
goods and chattels.’ 
During a lesson period set apart for private study 
the class could examine these extracts and endeavour 
to answer such questions as the following : 
1. In whose reign were these instructions given ? 
2. By whose authority were they issued ? 
3. What events took place in the interval between 
the issue of the two documents which helped to bring 
about the change of attitude ? 
4. Were books placed in all churches in accordance 
with the instructions of Extract (a)? If not, why not ? 
5. Why was it necessary to go to church in order 
to read the Bible? 
6. Who would the ‘better learned’ persons be 
likely to be ?. (End of Extract (a).) 
7. Why should women and working-class people 
be forbidden to read the New Testament in English ? 
8. What is meant by a ‘spiritual person ’ ? 
1 Thid., p. 145. 
   
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
9. Do you know of any heretics who were burned 
for ‘preaching, teaching or maintaining anything 
contrary to the King’s instructions’? ; 
If the examination of the extract is guided by such 
questions, and if a few books are available for reference, 
the exercise will prove an excellent preparation for 
enabling the class to take a more active part in the 
lesson than would otherwise be possible. 
(2) During an oral lesson sources can be used as 
illustrations,! or can be made the foundation of the . 
whole lesson. Sometimes an important constitutional 
document such as the Petition of Right, the Habeas 
Corpus Act, or the Bill of Rights, can be studied in 
a lesson or series of lessons; or a series of extracts 
to illustrate some event or movement can be given 
to the class and the lesson based upon the examination 
of these.” 
(3) After a lesson sources can be studied in order 
to revise and extend the facts learnt. .For example : 
(a) during a lesson on the causes of the American War 
of Independence, it would be out of place to give a 
long account of the corruption and incompetence of 
the English Government. Yet in order to understand 
the growing breach between England and the colonies 
the class must know something about the state of the 
home Government. After the lesson, then, the class 
could study for themselves extracts from the Letters 
of Junius, and make a note on this subject or answer 
a question. In doing this the children need not limit 
themselves to the extracts, but should obtain material 
from all available sources. The purpose of the extracts 
1 See p. 203 below. 2 p. 153 above, 
3 Bell’s English History Source Books, 1760-1801. 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
    LEARNING BY DOING = Cap 
is to supply pointed illustrations, not to be the sole 
source of the facts used. (b) A lesson on the conditions 
of children’s work in the early part of the nineteenth 
century could be illustrated by numerous illustrative 
' extracts from reports and speeches. But too many 
illustrations may burden a lesson and make it tedious, 
In these circumstances some of the extracts could be 
read during the lesson, e.g. the evidence of the child 
workers! and the statement by the commissioner on 
the condition of children’s work in mines. Then after 
the lesson the children could read for themselves an 
extract from a speech made in Parliament by Lord 
Ashley in 1842 giving further particulars about chil- 
dren’s work in mines,” and a short note could be made 
on the facts of the speech. 
We are now in a position to examine the value of 
sources in relation to work done by the children 
themselves. We have seen that original extracts can 
be used by the class in the following ways: 
1. Some can be read for the sake of the historical 
facts which they supply. In these cases the children 
derive the same benefit as from all other private study.® 
2, Sometimes they provide problems for investiga- 
tion. These problems cannot usually be solved by the 
examination of the extracts alone, but require reference 
to other sources of information. In these cases, then, 
the extracts supply a motive for private study. 
We must recognize, however, that original extracts, 
as distinct from modern sources of historical know- 
ledge, possess no peculiar value in themselves. Some 
teachers go so far as to consider that the study of 
1 p. 204 below. 2 Kendall’s Source Book, p. 401. 
3p, 174 above. ,
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
sources helps the child to develop a critical attitude of 
mind, not only in matters of history, but also towards © 
the problems of everyday life. But such a claim 
appears to be extravagant. The study of history in 
the upper classes should, of course, encourage the child . 
to refrain from hasty generalizations and dogmatic 
assertions. But sources are not essential in attaining 
this aim. The facts of history, as recounted in modern 
works, will provide abundant opportunities for selecting 
and weighing facts and coming to reasonable conclu- 
sions, when the children become capable of doing this ; 
whereas exercises of this nature based upon original 
authorities lose in value through the inherent difficulties 
attached to the use of sources. Tricky problems based 
on extracts and demanding an expression of opinion 
on the part of the child are often ingenious rather than 
useful. The facts supplied, even when several extracts 
from different sources are studied for a problem, are 
generally far too scanty to admit of generalizations. 
And so far from aiding the child to become truly 
critical they tempt him to come to rash conclusions 
and make worthless guesses at truth. 
Sources can, nevertheless, suggest hypotheses ; and 
these can be accepted as established truths after they 
have been fully sanctioned by reference to other 
authorities and modern works. In investigating a 
problem in everyday life we go to all possible sources 
provided they are reliable, and in giving the children 
opportunities for selecting and weighing evidence and 
coming to sound conclusions we must not deprive them 
of any readily accessible sources of evidence. In 
attempting to answer questions such as those given 
above (p. 183), a boy meets with difficulties for which
-P-A-G-E-187
  LEARNING BY DOING 187 
the extracts, however carefully they are studied, will 
not provide an answer. It is only reasonable that 
when this happens he should be allowed to turn to any 
books he can consult in order to find satisfactory 
answers. Often he will fail in his. search, and will 
then come to the next oral lesson eager for further 
knowledge. 
In training the children to acquire a critical attitude 
of mind we must emphasize the importance of having 
ample and credible evidence to support our opinion. 
The credibility of the evidence depends upon its source, 
and we must judge, before accepting it, whether the 
person from whom it is derived is likely to be both 
well-informed and unbiased. If any suspicion of 
unreliability attaches to the source we must naturally 
seek elsewhere for confirmation. This unreliability 
can, indeed, be occasionally of service to the teacher. 
The opinion of the court that Charles I was a ‘ tyrant, 
traitor, murderer, and public enemy to the good people 
of this nation’, is useful in judging the attitude of the 
extreme Parliamentarians towards the king. But any 
child will recognize it is worthless in estimating his 
character, although it was an expression of opinion 
by men living at the time. 
In teaching older children, then, we may meet with 
occasional opportunities of impressing them with the 
importance of examining the credibility and sufficiency 
of evidence, both in the little problems of history, with 
which we may confront them, and also in the affairs 
of everyday life. But children cannot in the least 
understand how the past has been reconstructed by 
historians. What appears in a text-book to be a simple 
fact is often the result of a lengthy examination of
-P-A-G-E-188
  
188 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
numerous sources by an historian of great learning and 
experience. In these days when the children are left — 
to do as much as possible for themselves there is danger 
of using the scientific method unduly in subjects where _ 
it ought to be only a subsidiary means of teaching. 
Exposition must remain the principal method, and 
should always either precede or follow the examination 
of sources and the study of topics from modern 
books. 
An undoubted drawback to the use of sources is 
the slow progress made by the class, unless the 
exercises are given only occasionally.. The study of 
extracts such as are quoted above involves careful 
examination and the investigation of little problems 
upon which considerable time must be expended. 
Although some good has undoubtedly been accom- 
plished by leaving a boy to puzzle out a point by him- 
self, yet this involves so much time that it is often 
wiser to present a problem and straightway supply 
the solution. Too much time devoted to the examina- 
tion of sources tends to make the work tedious. Chil- 
dren need movement and plenty of interesting details, 
which are rarely provided in original extracts. 
A word may be added as to the form in which sources 
are supplied to the class. The many published collec- 
tions are valuable for the variety of their extracts, 
and for this reason a number of such volumes should 
be found in the classroom library. But the teacher will 
rarely find any one volume which is in sufficient 
agreement with his scheme of oral work to warrant 
a copy being supplied to every pupil. When the teacher 
is able to do so, it is a good plan to make cyclostyled 
copies of extracts, since the range of sources from which
-P-A-G-E-189
  
  LEARNING BY DOING 189 
he can make a selection for any particular subject is 
much wider than those found in any single volume. 
III. Tue Srupy or LirzratTure 
Contemporary literature, when it reflects the history 
of a period, is often to be preferred to original sources 
for purposes of illustration. Although it is not always 
possible to make a clear distinction between original 
sources and the contemporary literature of an age, yet 
there are usually well-defined characteristics in all work 
which is real literature. The great mass of authori- 
ties are by no means literary in form, whilst, on the 
other hand, contemporary literature is not a prominent 
source of facts for the historian. But in the schoolroom 
the literature of a period is valued not so much for the 
facts which it embodies as for the form in which these 
facts are presented to the children. By reason of their 
classical form, literary extracts often make an appeal 
to a boy’s feelings and imagination when the words 
of a text-book or extracts from sources would leave 
him unmoved. ‘ In books’, says Carlyle, ‘lies the soul 
of the whole Past Time ; the articulate audible voice 
of the Past, when the body and material substance of 
it has altogether vanished like a dream.’* But the 
voice of the Past is only audible when a boy’s attention 
is arrested and his interest aroused by the manner in 
which facts are presented to him. The quaintness of 
Chaucer’s Prologue and the vivid character-sketches 
which are there portrayed will command our pupils’ 
interest far more than a paragraph of their text-books 
which contains almost identical facts. Professor C. H. 
Firth, in reference to nineteenth-century literature, 
_ 1 Heroes and Hero-Worship. The Hero as a Man of Letters,
-P-A-G-E-190
  
190 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
remarks, ‘ It shows far better than the summaries of 
causes usually given in text-books, the feelings which ~ 
inspired great movements and led to great events, 
» and the effect which both produced on the minds of 
those who lived through them. To see what contem- 
poraries thought about things makes the things them- 
selves easier to understand.’ * 
Since contemporary literature varies greatly in its 
nature, it is not uniformly useful in history teaching. 
Many of the great works of contemporary writers 
are entirely free from the influence of passing events 
and existing conditions, e.g. Milton’s Paradise Lost. 
But usually contemporary literature does reflect more 
or less the age in which it is written. Thus in eighteenth- 
century literature we find the social, economic and 
political conditions of the times portrayed in the novels 
of Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne ; in the 
works of Defoe, Swift, Goldsmith, Sheridan, and 
Burke ; in the Spectator and Tatler, and in the letters 
of Chesterfield, Lady Mary Wortley Montague, Horace 
Walpole, and Madame D’Arblay. These are not all of 
equal value for history teaching. In some the historical 
atmosphere pervades the whole work in so subtle and 
intimate a manner that it can only be appreciated by 
reading the whole or a considerable part of the book. 
But in many there are direct references to events and 
conditions which are of interest to the historical 
student. 
Modern works of an historical character often have 
an advantage over contemporary literature for teaching

Revolution to the death of Victoria, Introduction, p. xiii (Horace 
Marshall, 2s, 6d.).

purposes in being more clearly understood by children. © 
The historical element has been deliberately introduced 
and is therefore more obvious than in contemporary 
works. For example, Macaulay’s poem on the Battle 
of Naseby, in which he takes the Puritan standpoint of 
Obadiah Bind-their-kings-in-chains-and-their-nobles- 
with-links-of-iron, will be a clearer illustration of 
Puritan principles and prejudices than whole chapters 
from the memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson. But this 
is not always the case. When events and conditions 
are either described or directly referred to in contem- 
porary literature they usually make a great impression. 
Extracts from Fielding’s Amelia,’ Goldsmith’s Vicar of 
Wakefield, or Dickens’s Pickwick Papers * will give the 
class a more realistic account of the state of the prisons 
than they could get from a text-book, especially if 
_ the boys know that Goldsmith lived in fear of a debtor’s 
prison, and Dickens had become acquainted with one 
through the imprisonment of his father for debt. 
The literature of a period, whether contemporary 
or later, which is most useful in history teaching, can 
be classified in the following way : 
1. Prose fiction. Tales and romances which have 
a distinct historical element are invaluable in acquiring 
a liking for history and for supplying the ‘atmosphere’ 
of a period. Many of them are suitable for private 
reading, and should have a place in the school or class 
library. But many are unsuitable for boys and girls 
to read in extenso; and even when we think a book quite 
suitable we discover, to our surprise, that it is not always 
attractive to the youthful mind. Stories like Ivanhoe 
1 Book I, chap. iii, 2 Chap. xxvii. 
3 Chap. xli. 4 See Appendix IV.
-P-A-G-E-192
  
192 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
and The Talisman are sometimes tedious, even to older 
people, whilst children often find the wordiness and | 
lack of action in parts of the story insufferable. Histori- 
cal romances which for various reasons are unsuitable 
for complete reading can only be used by the teacher 
as a source of illustrations, unless a good abridged 
edition—and these are rare—can be obtained. 
The historical element in contemporary fiction is 
usually incidental, e. g. the descriptions of social life 
in the novelists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth 
centuries. 
Such books have the atmosphere of the period in 
which they are written, but cannot in any way be 
described as historical in character. They do, never- 
theless, often provide admirable illustrations for history 
teaching. The novels of Fielding and Smollett, for 
example, are crowded with intimate touches which 
throw light on many phases of eighteenth-century 
life, such as the state of the army and the navy, life 
in the town and the country, modes of travelling, &c. 
2. Many works, both contemporary and later, which 
are essentially historical in subject-matter have 
qualities which entitle them to be considered as 
literature. Memoirs, biographies, letters, speeches and 
histories, have often a literary style which recommends 
them for study both from a literary as well as an histori- 
cal point of view. 
3. Poems on historical subjects and historical plays 
are indispensable. Some of the best-known collections 
are the following :

lished for the Historical Association by Messrs. Bell at 1s. each.

The historical literature of a period can be used in 
various ways in upper classes. 
1. Books and poems can be recommended for private 
reading. It is a useful plan to publish at the beginning 
of each term a list of historical novels and general works 
of literature connected with the subjects to be studied 
during the term. But whether such a list is published 
or not, the teacher should refer in his lessons to the 
accessible books on the subjects taught which are 
suitable for further reading, and the boys should 
enter a list of these books in their note-books. 
The list will include references to standard works, 
sources, and general works of literature, especially 
historical novels and poetry. The standard works 
and sources can be read during private study, but there 
will be a tendency to neglect the general historical 
reading which the teacher expects the boys to do in 
their leisure time. Merely making entries in note-books 
is of no value unless the teacher ensures that books are 
being regularly read by all his pupils. This can be 
done if he (1) keeps a reading list in which is entered 
particulars of each boy’s reading ;° (2) requires each 
boy to enter in his note-book some of the historical 
1977 N
-P-A-G-E-194
  
194 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
facts which he has learnt in the course of his reading, 
together with occasional short extracts from the book 
or poem itself ; (3) discusses with individual boys the 
books they are reading—an important means of influ- 
encing their taste in literature ; (4) sets written tests, 
with a fair choice of questions, based upon a list of 
books which the whole class have had opportunity of 
reading. 
2. Hither before or after a lesson or course of lessons 
on a particular topic individual pupils could be asked 
to study books recommended to them and collect 
illustrative passages and facts. For example, they 
could collect facts from Scott’s Kenilworth bearing 
upon court life in the time of Elizabeth, or could read 
portions of the Spectator and the works of Goldsmith, 
such as his Letters from a Citizen of the World, and 
collect illustrations of the social state of England in 
the eighteenth century. The material, when collected, 
might be worked up into an essay which/the boy could 
read to the class. 
3. Extracts of all kinds, in prose and verse, like 
extracts from sources, can be studied either before 
or after a subject has been dealt with by the teacher, 
and exercises based upon them. For instance, after 
the class have studied the work of Cromwell in the 
second civil war of 1648 and his military campaigns 
in Ireland and Scotland, copies of the following sonnet 
can be supplied with questions based upon it: 
Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud 
Not of war only, but detractions rude, 
Guided by faith and matchless fortitude, 
To peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed, 
And on the neck of crownéd Fortune proud . 
Hast reared God’s trophies, and His work pursued,
-P-A-G-E-195
  
LEARNING BY DOING 195 
While Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbrued 
And Dunbar field resounds thy praises loud, 
And Worcester’s laureate wreath. Yet much remains 
To conquer still; peace hath her victories 
No less renowned than war: new foes arise, 
Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains : 
Help us to save free conscience from the paw 
Of hireling wolves, whose gospel is their maw. 
QUESTIONS 
1. Who was the author of this sonnet? Fix an 
approximate date for its composition. 
2. What were some of the ‘ detractions rude’, apart 
from war, which Cromwell had had to encounter ? 
3. Explain the allusions to Darwen, Dunbar, and 
Worcester. 
4. ‘Yet much remains to conquer still.’ What tasks 
still remained for Cromwell to perform ? 
5. Who were the ‘ new foes’ who threatened to use 
the secular power to suppress freedom of conscience ? 
To what extent was Cromwell in favour of religious 
freedom ? 
When the class-books for the study of literature 
include a collection of historical poems or works of 
an historical nature, as Scott’s Marmion, Shakespeare’s 
Henry V, or one of Macaulay’s Essays, many such 
exercises can be given. 
It is only necessary to add that we cannot separate 
the form and the content of literature. Where, then, 
co-ordination of work is possible in Literature and 
History both subjects are benefited. It is only when 
our pupils are acquainted with the ideas expressed in 
any work that its literary qualities can be fully appreci- 
ated. If, therefore, books are selected for literature 
N2
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
which contain subject-matter studied in the history 
lessons, the class can understand the content and be 
better able to appreciate the form. On the other hand, 
the historical facts will make a more lasting impression 
by being read in classical form. Some educationists, 
indeed, go so far as to hold that the study of history 
must be based upon classical literature. ‘ Periods 
that no master described, whose spirit no poet breathes, 
are of little value to education. Only classical presenta- 
tions invite the pupil to return to the treasures that 
never cease to reward him, and that fill him with 
interest and inspiration? ’! Whilst this opinion 
recognizes the great value of literary masterpieces in 
history teaching, it ignores the importance of the oral 
lesson and limits unnecessarily the range of history 
work in schools, 
IV. Depares 
Occasional debates are a pleasant variation from 
the more usual methods of revision. The subject of 
the debate should be selected by the teacher in consulta- 
tion with the class and should be one about which 
differences of opinion can arise. The teacher should 
ask for offers to open the debate, and the boys or girls 
who undertake to do this should have an opportunity 
of writing short papers to be read to the class. Since 
children of thirteen and upwards are quite capable 
of managing a debate successfully, they should elect 
their own chairman to control the proceedings. It is 
in ways like this that children can get some training 
in responsibility and self-government. During the 
debate the teacher, although in the background, 
should note the arguments, i.e. the facts brought 
1 Rein, Outlines of Pedagogics, p. 100.
-P-A-G-E-197
  
LEARNING BY DOING 197 
forward on which opinions are based, so that when the 
debate is over, he can discuss with the class the value of 
the evidence offered by the opposing sides. Much good 
work can be done in these little talks following debates, 
to help children towards those habits of careful-weighing 
of evidence and of forming well-founded opinions which 
were discussed in the first chapter. 
A few typical subjects which are suitable for dis- 
cussion are given below : . 
1. Was Henry VIII a true religious reformer ? 
2. Was Mary of England more to be pitied than 
blamed for her foreign and religious policy ? 
3. Was Charles I of England the victim of circum- 
stances ?

V. Wrirren Exercises 
A considerable amount of written work should be 
set in the upper classes for several reasons : 
1. It gives practice in the orderly arrangement and 
clear expression of ideas. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  
198 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
2. Written exercises are the best means of encourag- 
ing real thought as distinct from the mere reproduction 
of what has been remembered. In the upper classes 
the questions should, as far as possible, require the 
class to analyse their knowledge, make comparisons, 
and arrive at conclusions.1 Sometimes essays can be 
set such as those suggested above for class debates, 
which will necessitate the weighing of evidence and 
the expression of opinions. 
3. The writing of answers or an essay is the most 
satisfactory way of bringing the study of a topic to 
a close. It leads to the revision of note-books and the 
use of knowledge which has been collected in various 
ways—in the oral lesson, by private study, the examina- 
tion of\sources and the reading of literature. In 
preparing these answers or essays the boys will often 
discover the need for further knowledge; they will 
then turn once more to books or the teacher in order 
to make good their deficiency. 
4, Written work should occasionally be done in 
class as a test. Its value is not so much that it gives 
the teacher some idea of the success of his work, since 
he can judge this in other ways. It is rather from the 
pupil’s point of view that these exercises are useful. 
They give him practice in answering questions by 
relying upon the memory alone, without the aid of 
note-books or other sources of information. Such 
work, therefore, demands greater mastery of the 
material if it is to be successful. It gives a feeling of 
self-confidence if well done, whilst a poor attempt reveals 
the need for further study. For these reasons written 
tests are important in preparation for examinations. 
1 See Suggestions for Lessons at the end of Chapter IX,
-P-A-G-E-199
LEARNING BY DOING 199 
5. Lastly, in all written exercises a boy is learning 
through doing something by his own efforts, the result 
of which will depend upon himself and not upon the 
teacher. This is the ultimate value of all the work 
discussed in this chapter. 
A word may be added concerning the correction of 
exercises. The best method is, perhaps, for the teacher 
to mark them when alone, indicating the important 
faults, and afterwards to deal with general faults in 
class, and give each boy privately a few hints on indivi- 
dual points. But when the class is large or the teacher 
is busy he often cannot do this. He must then content 
himself with correcting the principal faults and return- 
ing the papers with a mark attached to each as an 
estimate of its value. Although the boys lose the 
benefit of the teacher’s criticism, they are helped a good 
deal by having the value of their work assessed. This 
should give them an ever-increasing standard to aim 
at ; and there is something radically wrong with a boy 
whose record of marks shows little or no progress. 
If, as must sometimes be the case, the teacher cannot 
mark all, or even some of the exercises, the work is 
still not fruitless, for, after all, the benefit from written 
work comes primarily through doing it, not through 
having it marked. The teacher need not be afraid to 
admit occasionally to his class that he has been unable 
to mark their exercises. When this happens he may 
find it useful to ask two or three boys to read their 
answers or essays to the class and spend a few minutes 
in discussing some of the points which arise.

  CHAPTER XII 
ILLUSTRATIONS 
In the course of oral work or private study the child 
will often meet with ideas which he can only understand 
in part, or scenes which are only dimly imaged in his 
mind. When this is likely to happen, the exposition of 
the teacher or the book must be supplemented by illus- 
trations. These, whilst differing widely in form, have 
one essential feature in common, without which they are 
useless—they illuminate the exposition of the teacher or 
the book. This purpose is accomplished in various ways. 
i. There are those illustrations which are introduced 
to give a clearer conception of something which is in 
nature ‘general’, as the character of a person, the 
policy of a statesman, or the characteristics of a people. 
Wolsey’s policy concerning the Church and his genius 
for diplomacy; Henry VII’s parsimony and_ his 
encouragement of maritime enterprise ; William III’s 
hostility to the French and his unpopularity in England, 
—these general topics can be illustrated and interpreted 
by particular examples. Such illustrations are generally 
verbal and are often in the form of stories or extracts 
from sources or literature. Where the teacher has 
a large stock of particular instances with which to 
illustrate a general idea, there may be a danger of over- 
illustrating, when the generalization is lost sight of in 
the particular cases. 
2. Some illustrations assist the imagination. Children 
vary greatly in the power to visualize the scenes of
-P-A-G-E-201
ILLUSTRATIONS 201 
history which the teacher describes, i.e. they have not 
all an equally active historical imagination. But they 
are all deficient both in knowledge and in the power 
of attention, the foundations upon which the historical 
imagination is built. They must, therefore, all be 
aided by the use of pictures, diagrams, models, and 
relics, and by visits to places of historical interest. 
3. Other illustrations are in the form of symbolical 
devices which help the children to understand the course 
of events and the relations between facts. Time-charts, 
maps, and genealogical tables belong to this class. 
In the more detailed examination which follows, the 
classification is based upon differences in form. 
A. Versa ILLusTRATIONS é 
These are the most commonly used in history 
teaching : 
1. Every particular fact is an illustration of some 
more general idea. The teacher, then, must have a 
good stock of stories and instances to illustrate the broad 
ideas of history. For example, in illustrating the 
superstitions of people in olden times reference could 
be made to the belief in witchcraft ; and in order to 
illustrate how widespread this belief was, and how 
harsh and unreasonable were the methods of proceed- 
ing against witches, the teacher could give the class the 
following particulars: In 1612 there were 12 persons 
executed at Lancaster for witchcraft; in 1622, 6 at 
York; in 1634, 17 in Lancashire; in 1644, 16 at 
Yarmouth ; in 1645, 15 at Chelmsford ; and in 1645-6, 
120 in Suffolk and Huntingdon. In this century the 
notorious witchfinder, Matthew Hopkins, undertook 
to clear any locality of witches for 20s., bringing them
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
to confession and the stake in the following way. He 
stripped them naked, wrapped them in sheets, and 
dragged them through ponds or rivers. If they sank, 
it was held to be a sign of their innocence ; but if they 
floated, as they would usually do for a time, they were 
then considered guilty. He sometimes kept supposed 
witches fasting and awake for twenty-four hours as an 
inducement to confession. Moreover, if a witch could 
not shed tears at command, or if she hesitated at 
a single word in repeating the Lord’s Prayer, she was 
held to be in league with the Evil One. The results of 
such tests were universally admitted as evidence by 
the judges or magistrates, who, acting upon them, 
condemned all who did not conform to the recognized 
tests of the witchfinders. 
This example illustrates the general rule of history 
teaching, which has been already emphasized, that 
general ideas can only be approached by the child 
through particular instances. The teacher so often 
fails to make a clear, lasting impression on the child 
because he lacks this knowledge of interesting, detailed 
facts. The only remedy is continuous reading in order 
to collect this illustrative material. 
2. The use of literature in supplying illustrations 
for history teaching has already been discussed. It 
need only be added at this point that the oral lesson 
is often strengthened by the introduction of literary 
extracts. For example, in giving a lesson on Napoleon’s 
invasion of Russia in 1812 the teacher will find several 
extracts in Merriman’s Barlasch of the Guard, which will 
be welcomed by the class, however excellent his own 
narration of the story may be. Or, during a lesson on 
the battle of Waterloo, the teacher could read from
-P-A-G-E-203
  ILLUSTRATIONS 203 
Fitchett’s Deeds that won the Empire the vivid descrip- 
tions of the French cavalry charges and the final 
repulse of the Old Guard. 
Historical poetry is especially useful in this way. 
If a poem is vigorous and picturesque, it can be read 
by the teacher to supplement his description, e.g. 
Drayton’s Agincourt, Scott’s description of Flodden, 
Tennyson’s Revenge, Praed’s Sir Nicholas at Marston 
Moor, and Massey’s Robert Blake. If, however, 
a poem lacks movement or is not readily understood 
by the class, the reading of it is worse than useless. 
It proves tedious or confusing to the children and 
naturally dissipates their interest in the subject which 
it is supposed to illustrate. 
3. Similarly, extracts from sources can very fre- 
quently be used for purposes of illustration during 
a lesson. A teacher with a good range of suitable 
selections at his disposal can often make his teaching 
more realistic by quoting the testimony of contem- 
porary writers. For example, in speaking of the 
intolerance of the Puritans, the following extract from 
a letter written by a Puritan sergeant at Hereford in 
1642 will be useful : : 
Sabbath Day, about the time of morning prayer, 
we went to the minster, where the pipes played, and 
the puppets sang so sweetly that some of our soldiers 
could not forbear dancing in the holy choir, whereat 
the Baalists were sore displeased. The anthem ended, 
they fell to prayer and prayed devoutly for the King, 
the bishops, etc.; and one of our soldiers with a loud 
voice, said, ‘What! never a bit for the Parliament,’ 
which offended them much more. Not satisfied with 
this human service, we went to Divine, and, passing by, 
found shops open and men at work, to whom we gave
-P-A-G-E-204
  204 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
some plain dehortations,and went to hear Mr. Sedgwick, 
who gave us two famous sermons, which much affected 
the poor inhabitants, who, wondering, said they never 
heard the like before. And I believe them.? 
Extracts from the Reports of Commissioners ap- 
pointed in the early part of the nineteenth century 
to inquire into the conditions of work in the textile 
trades and in mines are also valuable for illustration. 
The following testimony needs no comment on the 
part of the teacher: 
Am twelve years old. Have been in the mill twelve 
months. Begin at six o’clock and stop at half-past 
seven. Generally have about twelve hours and a half 
of it. Have worked over-hours for two or three weeks 
together. Worked breakfast time and tea time and 
did not go away till eight. 
Another child : 
Have worked here two years; am now fourteen ; 
work sixteen hours and a half a day. I was badly and 
asked to stop at eight one night lately, and I was told 
if I went I must not come back. 
And another : 
We used to come at half-past eight at night and 
work all night till the rest of the girls came in the 
morning. They would come at seven. Sometimes we 
worked on till half-past eight the next night, after we 
had been working all the night before. We worked at 
meal hours except at dinner.? 
The above are from the Reports of the Commissioners 
in 1833. The following, from the Reports of 1840, 
show the condition of children’s work in mines :

Amongst the children employed there are almost 
always some mere infants ; the practice of employing 
children only six or seven years of age is all but uni- 
versal, and there are no short hours for them. The 
children go down with the men, usually at 4 o’clock 
in the morning and remain in the pit between eleven 
and twelve hours. 
The passages in the pit were separated by doors 
which regulated the ventilation. The Report proceeds : 
The use of a child six years of age is to open and 
shut these doors when the trucks pass and repass. For 
this object the child is trained to sit by itself in a dark 
gallery for the number of hours I have described. 
In speaking of the corruption of local government 
before the Municipal Corporation Act, the following par- 
ticulars from the records of Hartlepool are interesting.”

206 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
An extract from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle shows 
the superstition with which the people at an earlier 
date regarded an eclipse : 
A. 1135. This year, at Lammas, king Henry went 
over sea: and on the second day, as he lay asleep in 
the ship, the day was darkened universally, and the 
sun became as if it were a moon three nights old, with 
the stars shining round it at mid-day. Men greatly 
marvelled, and great fear fell on them, and they said 
that some great event should follow thereafter—and 
so it was, for the same year the king died in Normandy. 
The above extracts can be used in oral lessons as 
illustrations of more general truths. The particular 
instance, if considered first, prepares the way for the 
generalization, and may be so used if we remember 
that the generalization has been, in reality, derived 
from a large number of particular instances. The 
extract is often better introduced after the general 
statement has been made, to elucidate and fix it in the 
children’s minds. By doing this we remove the danger 
of generalizing from one or two examples. 
Original extracts such as those which have been 
quoted, cannot fail to bring into clear relief ideas 
which the teacher wishes to impress upon his pupils. 
The simple words of a child worker suggest a vivid 
picture of labour conditions and appeal to our sympathy- 
when more elaborate descriptions would fail, for the 
child’s narrative is full of human interest. A final 
example of this human element in original sources may 
be taken from Whitelocke’s Memorials. He tells us 
that Cromwell ‘would sometimes be very cheerful, 
and laying aside his greatness’ would be exceedingly 
familiar, and by way of diversion would make verses 
with them, and every one must try his fancy. He
-P-A-G-E-207
  
ILLUSTRATIONS 207 
commonly called for tobacco, pipes and a candle, and 
would now and then take tobacco himself; then he 
would fall again to his serious and great business.’ + 
Here is an intimate touch which reveals Cromwell as 
the genial companion when the robe of office was cast 
aside. 
B. Picrurss, SkretcHEs, AND MopELs 
We have already seen that if history is to be made 
interesting for the lower classes, the proper materials 
for teaching are dramatic scenes and heroic characters. 
But young children are not alone in their love of the 
picturesque. All people love stories, and the pageant 
of history usually appeals to our oldest pupils far more 
than the study of abstract generalizations or causes 
and effects. This pleasure of hearing a dramatic 
story depends to a great extent upon the activity of 
the imagination. When a teacher is telling a story, 
the children, with very few exceptions, visualize the 
episodes. But the events narrated may be quite 
‘outside the range of the children’s experience, in 
which case the mental pictures are either shadowy 
and indistinct or greatly distorted and bear little 
resemblance to the real scene. 
This inability to visualize accurately arises from two 
causes: the children may not possess the elements 
of the picture, and they may be unable to develop the 
picture from these elements. That is, they may lack 
knowledge, or may lack experience in using this 
knowledge to form in imagination the scenes of history. 
The battle of Agincourt may be taken as an illustra- 
tion of this point. If the children are to be able to 
1 Quoted in Morley’s Life of Cromwell, p. 473.
-P-A-G-E-208
  208 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
imagine the scene on the battlefield, they must know, 
amongst other things, the appearance of an English 
archer, a man-at-arms and a knight, a French knight 
and a foot-soldier, and the nature of the place where 
the fight took place. Unless the children have these 
elements, they cannot form a picture of the scene 
which is at all accurate. But even if they can visualize 
the elements, they may still be unable to mass the 
soldiers on both sides and follow their movements, 
especially when the armies meet in conflict. For many 
children pictures of the fight will be necessary for 
a proper understanding of the story. There are, then, 
two kinds of illustrations for use in telling such stories, 
viz. pictures of historical scenes, and sketches, diagrams, 
models, &c. 
An historical picture is a portrayal of a scene as 
imagined by the artist. ‘There are, indeed, as many 
Fields of the Cloth of Gold as there are painters who 
have ventured to reproduce the scene.’+ When such 
a picture is used in a lesson, the children accept that 
view of the scene, and their imagination becomes at 
once restricted. This may perhaps be a drawback, 
although some teachers are inclined to exaggerate the 
importance of giving as much freedom as possible to the 
imagination. Restrictions upon the imagination which 
are imposed in order to give clearness and accuracy are 
to be preferred to freedom which inevitably leads to 
confusion and inaccuracy. Moreover, this objection 
to pictures of historical scenes also applies to sketches 
of historical objects, and indeed to all illustrations 
which are used to typify something which is in nature 
more general. A single picture of a Tudor house will 
1 Adams, Exposition and Illustration, p. 333.
-P-A-G-E-209
  ILLUSTRATIONS 209 
incline the child to think all Tudor houses are similar 
to the one represented. A visit to a Roman camp, or 
a verbal description of a certain sea-fight, may lead 
him to think all camps or sea-fights are similar to the 
particular one used as an illustration. It would, 
perhaps, be better to show several pictures of the 
battle of Agincourt, or several sketches of Tudor 
houses, to visit several types of Roman camps, to give 
several descriptions of sea-fights. But this is often 
impossible. And, after all, there is a very real danger 
in using too many illustrations. We must beware, in 
our desire to illustrate a topic as fully as possible, lest 
the study of that topic degenerates more or less into 
a passive survey of the illustrations. 
Asingle picture of a scene can usually be of great use, 
Although it may check activity of the imagination, 
it combines together many elements and often gives 
a vivid representation of a scene which it would be 
quite impossible for the child to imagine ; it conveys 
much historical information if it is correct ; and it is 
a mental stimulus in rousing the spectator’s interest 
and often his emotions. For example, a picture of the 
last fight of the Revenge as viewed from the deck of 
Grenville’s vessel, shows us the heroic figures of 
Sir Richard and his men, their costumes and weapons, 
the appearance of the ship and its guns, the crowd 
of Spanish vessels and the shimmering sea beyond. 
When a picture such as this is shown to a class they 
become at once more interested in the teacher’s 
description of the fight, for the story has become more 
real; and a feeling of admiration is aroused for the 
gallant Englishmen. 
Besides the occasional use of pictures, the teacher 
1977 Oo 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  210 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
must supplement his descriptive work with sketches, 
photographs, and portraits to illustrate costume, 
armour, architecture, and the things of everyday life. 
Photographs and sketches of buildings can be shown 
if they really assist the child in a better understanding 
of the teacher’s description. Portraits, especially full- 
length ones which illustrate modes of dress, are useful 
in forming a fuller conception of the great characters 
of history. But too often illustrations are used in 
lessons and inserted in text-books which have little 
or no value. Sketches of the ordinary dress of gentle- 
men in 1675, of a cup presented in 1676 by Charles IT 
to the Barber-Surgeons Company, and of the steeple 
of the church of St. Mary-le-Bow, London, are out of 
place in a chapter on the political history of the years 
1675-81.' Inappropriate illustrations are worse than 
none at all. 
Sketches usually do not give a full representation 
of an object or scene, but in a few clear lines emphasize 
the features which we wish to illustrate. Much is 
omitted so that the attention may be concentrated on 
important points. That is, every sketch is more or less 
abstract ; it has been robbed of some of its reality in 
order that it may prove a more effective illustra- 
tion. A few lines on the blackboard will show the 
general shape of a viking ship, if this is the point 
which the teacher wishes at the moment to illustrate, 
far better than a picture of a Danish raid on Paris, 
in which the children’s attention may be distracted 
by many other features. The value of a sketch is 
not, therefore, in direct proportion to its degree of 
reality. 
1 See 8S. R. Gardiner’s Student’s History of England.
-P-A-G-E-211
  ILLUSTRATIONS 211 
Models are also occasionally useful; but teachers 
are sometimes inclined to over-estimate their value as 
illustrations. They are, like diagrams, exceedingly 
abstract, and ‘ they have all the defects of the diagram, 
as well as its merits. They are, indeed, nothing more 
than three-dimensioned diagrams.’ Moreover, good 
teaching models are generally far more difficult to 
make than sketches. 
There can be no fixed rule as to when these illustra- 
tions should be shown. If they are on view for several 
days before the lesson, the child, by examining them, 
will be better able to understand the lesson. When 
shown during the lesson they should be large enough 
to be displayed in front of the class. Incidental black- 
board sketches are often the best kind of illustration 
for use during the lesson. Historical pictures are often 
not shown until the lesson is over, so that the children 
may have an opportunity of forming their own mental 
pictures. An objection which is raised against doing 
this is that if the children have succeeded in visualizing 
the scene, they resent having a picture shown to them 
which does not agree with the one they have already 
formed. But in reality this objection has little force. 
If the teacher has been careful to give the class a broad 
outline of the scene, the children’s images may be 
indefinite, but should not be inaccurate. The class 
will then welcome the picture as an aid to more 
definite visualization. A picture would not be shown 
at all unless the teacher considered the scene too 
difficult for the majority of the children to visualize 
clearly. i

212 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
C. SymporicaL ILLUsTRATIONS 
Apart from. sketches with a considerable degree of 
abstractness, which are usually termed diagrams, and 
have been referred to above, the principal symbolical 
illustrations used in history teaching are the following: 
1. Maps. These must be used in almost every 
lesson. In particular, they are indispensable when 
studying military and naval campaigns, voyages of 
discovery, the settlement of new lands, the disposition 
of territories by treaties, and the development of 
industry and trade. Each child should have an atlas 
in which the maps show clearly the physical features. 
Large-scale maps, such as are not usually found in 
atlases, will occasionally be necessary and can either 
be placed before the class during the lesson, or supplied 
to each pupil, e.g. a sketch of the Scottish Border to 
illustrate the battle of Flodden, of part of Belgium for 
the campaign of Waterloo, or of the West Riding of 
Yorkshire when studying the importance of water- 
power and coal during the Industrial Revolution. The 
children should also make sketch-maps of their own, 
or be supplied with outlines which can be filled in as 
the work proceeds, e.g. in studying the Industrial 
Revolution maps could be made showing the growth 
of population, the expansion of industries, the rise of 
towns, and improvements in communications. 
2. Time Charts. These are also essential. Some 
consist merely of a line of time, either vertical or 
horizontal, the facts to be learnt being placed in their 
proper position along this line. The children should 
make these simple charts in their note-books to illus- 
trate such topics as the settlements of the Northmen,
-P-A-G-E-213
  ILLUSTRATIONS 213 
the Crusades, the voyages of discovery in the fifteenth 
and sixteenth centuries, the Reformation, the Civil 
War in the reign of Charles I, the growth of the English 
colonies, or for the public career of a great man. A 
general line of time on which facts of various kinds are 
shown, has the same defect as a date-book ; the ‘facts 
concerning various topics are intermingled and lose 
much of their significance. It has the disturbing 
feature of calling to mind irrelevant facts when we 
are using it to revise any particular subject. Moreover, 
when prominently displayed in the classroom, in the 
hope that the children may in odd moments learn 
some of the dates, it cannot fail to lessen the children’s 
interest in history. The simple line of time can be 
developed by the addition of pictures. In some schools 
a continuous band of paper is fixed round the walls 
at a convenient height and divided into sections. 
Sketches with explanatory notes are then added in 
the correct position to illustrate topics studied during 
the year. Another form of time chart is the graph 
which indicates the approximate rate and extent of 
development in some particular direction, e.g. the 
growth of population or of trade, the growth of the 
British Empire, or the growth and decline of English 
power in France in the Middle Ages. 
3. Genealogical Tables. These must also be occasion- 
ally used. Their purpose is not merely to show family 
relationships, but to explain further facts by referring 
to these relationships. For example, Elizabeth could 
not, if she would, marry Philip IT, for if it were lawful by 
canon law for him to marry his deceased wife’s sister, 
it would have been equally lawful for Katharine of 
Aragon to have married her deceased husband’s
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
brother, which Elizabeth denied, thereby making 
herself the legitimate child of Henry VIII and Anne 
Boleyn. This fact can only be clearly explained by 
means of a table. Other instances are Mary Queen of 
Scot’s claim to the English throne, the adherence of 
the Nevilles to the Yorkist cause in the Wars of the 
Roses, the accession of James I, William III, and 
George I to the throne of England, and wars arising 
from disputed succession, such as the Fifteen and Forty- 
five rebellions. Itis not, of course, necessary that every 
name on the table should have some significance for 
our pupils ; some will be mere connecting links. But 
in the case of persons whose actions are being studied, 
pictures, sketches, and short extracts can not beattached 
to the name. The children will, in this way, acquire 
by association some historical facts, and there will be 
less danger of the genealogical table representing 
nothing but a list of names. 
D. MarertaL REMAINS 
As illustrations, objects and places with historical 
associations may be compared with pictures and 
sketches in helping us to reconstruct the past. Any- 
thing belonging to a former age, whether it be a flint 
arrowhead or a suit of armour, a druidical circle or 
a stately minster, brings the past nearer to the present 
and gives reality to the people of long ago. Such 
historical remains may be classified either as relics or 
as places of interest. 
1. Relics. Articles which illustrate the everyday 
life of the people in a past age, armour and weapons, 
and objects associated with historic personages and 
events, could often make the history lesson far more
-P-A-G-E-215
  ILLUSTRATIONS 215 
interesting, but such objects are usually accessible only 
in museums. Ifthe school is within reasonable distance 
and the visit is carefully arranged, the teacher will 
often find in an historical collection some of the best 
illustrations for a. particular subject. Primitive life 
is represented by flint implements and articles found 
in barrows; Roman Britain by coins, tombstones, 
pavements, and altars, besides lamps and urns, and 
many other articles of domestic use; whilst the 
succeeding centuries of our national history are repre- 
sented by arms and armour, articles of dress, and 
innumerable other objects illustrating the various 
phases of the life of the people. Other relics are 
connected with well-known events, such as a sword 
or helmet found on a battlefield, or with historic 
persons, such as an autograph letter or some article 
of personal use. 
In planning the visit the teacher should make a pre- 
liminary survey of the contents of the museum in order 
toselect a limited number of objects relating to a definite 
period or topic which the children are studying. But 
if he expects the visit to be really profitable, he must 
do more than this. The children will require guidance 
in their observation, else they will overlook much 
which is important and notice many things which have 
no connexion with the subjects they are studying. 
The teacher must therefore direct their attention to 
the things he wishes them to notice, often by getting 
them to make rough sketches of these objects on the 
spot. Unless the visit is carefully supervised, it will 
degenerate, as it usually does, into ‘looking round’ 
the museum, which, as a help to history teaching, will 
be both dull and futile.

  216 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
2. Places of Historical Interest. In every district 
there are places with historical associations and objects 
in their natural surroundings which can be visited 
by the children. The following places are readily 
accessible from many schools : 
British Remains. Hill fortresses, found in all parts 
of England ; barrows, i.e. prehistoric graves ; stone 
circles, as Avebury and Stonehenge, and many smaller 
ones in all parts; pit dwellings, e.g. those on Rum- 
bold’s Moor in the West Riding of Yorkshire. 
Here and there are other prehistoric remains, e. g. 
the cup and ring stones on Rumbold’s Moor near 
Ilkley (boulders upon which mystic circles have been 
carved—their purpose is unknown), and the Peddar’s 
Way, a pre-Roman road in West Norfolk. 
Roman Remains. Camps, some of which still retain 
their stone vallum or rampart ; buildings and walls, 
as the Roman baths at Bath, lighthouse at Dover, 
tower at’ York, walls at York, London, and other 
places, and the great wall across the north of England ; 
roads, many of which are still our main roads, whilst 
others are grassy lanes away from beaten tracks. 
Of later remains churches, monasteries, castles, and 
houses, like relics in museums, may be interesting, 
either because they illustrate the life of the people, 
or because they are associated with some well-known 
person or event. 
Ancient Churches and Cathedrals, in all parts of the 
British Isles, are generally well worth visiting. Among 
points of interest are : 
(1) The architecture. Besides illustrating styles of 
architecture, many churches have such points of interest 
as a leper’s squint, a parvise or room over the porch
-P-A-G-E-217
  ILLUSTRATIONS ae 
where the parish priest often lived and kept school, and 
a low-side window in the south side of the chancel, 
_at which a light was perhaps placed in olden days in 
order to frighten spirits from the churchyard. 
(2) The internal decoration. Some retain pre- 
Reformation paintings, and coloured decorations, e.g. 
on the wall of Fritton Church in Suffolk there is a 
painting which probably commemorates the recovery 
of the inhabitants from the Black Death in 1350. 
(3) The furniture. This often illustrates the Church 
before the Reformation, e.g. the rood screen, sanctus 
bell, stone altar with hole for relics, and holy water 
stoup. In many churches the font is very old, e.g. 
that in St. Martin’s Church, Canterbury, is supposed 
to have been used when Ethelbert of Kent was baptized, 
and there is one in Burnsall Church, Yorks., which is 
evidently of Danish origin. 
(4) Monuments. Tombs and wall monuments of 
well-known people are interesting because of their 
associations, e.g. those in Westminster Abbey. Tombs 
can also be studied for illustrations of dress and armour, 
e.g. those of crusaders found in some churches. Dress 
is also illustrated by ancient brasses. 
Monasteries. In some cases little is left to mark 
the site, yet the place possesses the charm of histori- 
cal associations. For example, the Abbey of Bury 
St. Edmunds is in utter decay, but retains interest for 
the historical student as the abode of Abbot Samson 
(Carlyle’s Past and Present and Jocelyn of Brakelond), 
and it was at the high altar, the site of which is indi- 
cated, that Stephen Langton and the barons swore 
a solemn oath to bring King John to account. Some 
years before this, so Jocelyn tells us, John stayed at
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the Abbey a fortnight, and in leaving gave thirteen 
pence for the monks to say a mass for him, and 
also pretended to bestow upon the Abbey a silk cloak, _ 
which was immediately borrowed by one of his retainers 
and never seen again. 
Walsingham Priory in Norfolk, of which there are 
few traces left, has many associations. It was visited 
by Erasmus in 1511, and Henry VIII, barefoot, made 
a pilgrimage there from East Barsham Hall, five miles 
away, and brought with him, as an offering for the 
shrine of the Virgin, a chain of gold. 
There are other monasteries, better preserved, which 
illustrate monastic life in the Middle Ages. Fountains 
and Kirkstall in Yorkshire are good examples, whilst 
Westminster Abbey and some cathedrals, as Durham 
and Norwich, retain features of their monastic origin. 
Castles illustrate the domestic life of the nobles and 
the methods of warfare in the Middle Ages. 
In some towns, as York, there are still walls and gates 
existing which illustrate the defence of towns. More- 
over, here and there throughout the country there are 
old buildings of various kinds with historical associa- 
tions, such as the Norman leper hospital at Norwich and 
the hospital at Bury St. Edmunds in which Humphrey, 
Duke of Gloucester, met a mysterious death in 1447. 
Sites of historic buildings and events, though now 
marked by no material remains, are often worth a 
visit, e.g. the battlefield of Towton, where the stream 
ran red with blood and was bridged by the bodies 
of the slain on that fateful Sunday in 1461 which saw 
the overthrow of the Lancastrian cause. 
Apart from these more pretentious remains, there is 
hardly a village which does not provide some interesting
-P-A-G-E-219
  
ILLUSTRATIONS 219 
link with the past, e.g. the village green, in the Middle 
Ages the scene of the village sports and festivities ; 
the village cross ; the stocks and whipping-post ; and 
old houses and inns with interesting associations. 
The importance of these material illustrations need 
not be emphasized. A clearer, more accurate historical 
imagination is developed in children by bringing them 
closer to the past ; a deeper interest is inspired in all 
that pertains to bygone ages, And, after all, our 
teaching must fail unless we car connect history with 
the world of to-day outside the school. ‘It is far more 
important that pupils should leave school with their 
eyes trained to observe the historical remains which 
are to be found in almost every part of England, than 
that they should attempt to remember the whole of 
the political history, much of which they cannot 
understand.’ ? : 
Although there are historical remains in the neigh- 
bourhood of almost every school, yet those which can 
be visited by the children are usually very few in 
number. But even when remains cannot be visited, 
the teacher can still make the children’s knowledge 
more definite by referring, in the course of his teaching, 
to particular illustrations, not only in the neighbour- 
hood, but also in other parts. 
E. Locan History 
The local history which may be used to illustrate 
general history is varied in character. In some districts 
we can learn much about the successive races of people 
who inhabited the neighbourhood, or at any rate can

Secondary Schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  * 
220 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
refer to a British camp, a Roman road, a Saxon cross, 
or a Norman church, which will remind the children 
that these people lived in their own district. Local 
history also provides illustrations of industrial changes, 
e.g. the history of Leeds and district illustrates various 
phases of the Industrial Revolution, such as develop- 
ments in the woollen and iron trades, the change from 
the domestic to the factory system, and improvements 
in communications. The history of the Church can be 
illustrated in many ways, e.g. by reference to churches 
and monasteries, local saints, and settlements of friars. 
Similarly, the life of the people, the development of 
local government, and of parliamentary representation, 
and other phases of national history can be illustrated 
by examples from the neighbourhood of the school. 
Many of these facts can be found in books on local 
history ; but both teachers and pupils should, as far 
as possible, study the sources of local history for 
themselves. The chief of such sources are : 
(1) Material remains. 
(2) Records of various kinds, e. g. municipal records, 
which are often published, will provide many sidelights 
on town life and government ;' reports of various 
Royal Commissions and of local enclosures of commons 
are other examples of local records which provide 
illustrations of national history. 
(3) Local names. A mere name is often sufficient 
to recall an important fact, e.g. the defences of London 
no longer exist, but numerous names, such as Ludgate, 
Barbican, and Shoreditch, remind us of the time when 
the City was protected by walls and ditches. Eastcheap 
and Cheapside remind us of the chapmen or traders 
1 See the extract quoted above from the records of Hartlepool.
-P-A-G-E-221
  
ILLUSTRATIONS 221 
who frequented these districts of London, and the 
church of St. Clement Danes most probably in its 
name preserves a reminiscence of a Danish raid or 
settlement. Equally good illustrations are found in 
almost every town and even in some villages. At 
Norwich there are Blackfriars Hall, Whitefriars Bridge, 
and the Lollards Pit. At Harewood, near Leeds, 
Bondgate reminds us of the unfree tenants of the lords 
of Harewood in the Middle Ages. 
(4) Lastly, local stories, beliefs, and customs are 
often excellent illustrations of general history. The 
story of St. William, the boy-martyr, who is said to 
have been crucified by the Jews in Norwich, shows the 
antagonism between Christians and Jews before their 
expulsion from England in 1290. The belief in witches, 
which still lingers in a few backward districts, reminds 
us of the superstitious nature of the people in past _ 
ages. The custom of ringing the curfew bell, which 
has survived to the present day in a few places, is 
a connecting link between Norman times and to-day. 
Little need be said concerning the value of local 
history. When the illustrations are selected from the 
locality of the school they bring the story of the nation 
within the limits of everyday experience. But local 
examples taken from other districts are often of great 
service in making the children’s knowledge definite 
and particular, rather than vague and general. In all 
cases local illustrations lift national history beyond 
the realm of mere abstraction and make it, for many 
pupils at least, a vivid and fascinating reality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
CHAPTER XIII 
CONCLUSION 
THE aim of this book is to give practical help in the 
teaching of history. But to many teachers the schemes 
and methods of the foregoing chapters will no doubt 
appear to be far from practical. ‘You forget’, they 
will say, ‘that history is only one of many subjects 
taught in school ; yet if we followed your suggestions 
several hours a week would be devoted to it.’ And 
teachers in elementary schools will add that the 
necessary preparation would make heavy demands 
upon their scanty leisure. 
A final question, therefore, requires examination. 
If the inclusion of history in the curriculum can only 
be justified on the grounds indicated in the first chapter, 
and if the aims there expressed can only be attained 
by a comprehensive scheme of work and the adoption 
of methods suggested in the following chapters, then 
how is it possible to carry out these suggestions in 
actual teaching ? The answer is that the teacher must 
have adequate opportunity for the preparation of his 
lessons and adequate time for teaching them. 
I. In elementary schools both these conditions for 
successful work are usually wanting. 
1. Preparation of lessons, which must be thorough 
and constant in subjects such as history, is only possible 
if teachers have access to a good supply of historical 
books and have time for reading them. Yet the 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  CONCLUSION 223 
necessary books often cannot be obtained ;+ and even 
when this difficulty is overcome, the teacher has little 
time or inclination to read them. The reason for this 
is not far to seek. At present elementary teachers are 
expected to be able to teach all the subjects of the 
curriculum, an arrangement having the sanction of 
tradition, but finding no justification in the schools 
of to-day. There was a time when the almost exclusive 
aim of the elementary schools was to give the children 
a mastery over the English language, written and spoken, 
and the elementary processes of arithmetic. Geography 
was usually added, but drawing, handwork, physical 
exercises, history, literature, and science found no 
place on the time-table. Now it is evident that arith- 
metic, reading, and writing, all of them mechanical 
arts, could be taught more or less successfully without 
special training. The study of books and a knowledge 
of sound teaching methods. were by no means an 
' essential part of the pedagogue’s equipment. But 
since those primitive times the art of teaching has been 
revolutionized. The extension of the curriculum and 
the development in methods of teaching make the 
teacher’s task an impossible one. He must inevitably 
be inefficient in some part of his work. 
Any one experienced in the work of training teachers 
for elementary schools must have become painfully 
aware of the reality of this evil. The students who 
enter training colleges are allowed to specialize in a 
limited degree by selecting a group of subjects for study. 
At the same time an attempt is made to give them 
some training in teaching all subjects of the elementary 
school curriculum. Thus students who are not studying 
1 See p. 179 on the school library. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
    224 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
history or geography or nature-study or mathematics 
are receiving practice in teaching these subjects. 
Anything less than this general training would be 
detrimental to their professional prospects, although 
the Board of Education, by making provision for 
some specialization in studies and allowing an advanced 
course to be taken in the teaching of a selected subject, 
seems to be pointing the way to some form of specializa- 
tion in schools. 
It is in the schools themselves where any change in 
this direction is most vigorously opposed. We are 
reminded of difficultiés of organization and told that 
without an additional teacher on the staff it would 
be impossible to construct a specialist time-table. 
Much, of course, depends upon the size of the school 
and the efficiency of the staffing. In small schools 
with very few classes specialization is out of the 
question ; but in larger schools the difficulties should 
not be insuperable. The best results are perhaps 
attained where a limited form of specialization has 
been introduced. A teacher is restricted, not to 
a subject, but to a group of subjects. The more 
mechanical work—arithmetic and language teaching, 
including reading, writing, and composition—is taken 
by all teachers with their own classes. The other 
subjects are taught by those who are already specialists 
or who become so by reason of more preparation and 
teaching. To be limited in one’s preparation to litera- 
ture and history, or geography and science, or physical 
exercises and singing, or art and handwork, is a great 
relief to the hard-worked teacher. This arrange- 
ment, when tried, has increased the efficiency of the 
teaching by (1) giving those teachers who already
-P-A-G-E-225
  ¢ 
CONCLUSION 225 
have a bias in a particular direction greater opportuni- 
ties for using their powers; and (2) by increasing 
the interest which comes through the intensive study 
and teaching of particular subjects. If even small 
secondary schools, which are not always well staffed, 
can be organized on more or less specialist lines, this 
should not be impossible in a great many elementary 
schools. 
A second objection to specialization which is some- 
times advanced is that it is unnecessary. The standard 
of learning required in the elementary school is so 
low that every teacher can reasonably be expected 
to teach every subject. Such an argument shows 
a lamentable ignorance of sound aims and methods. 
For example, to teach history successfully to young 
children, much more is required than a few facts 
gathered from the school-reader or a text-book. The 
teacher who has no further equipment than this for 
his lesson is doing far more harm than good. He would 
be far better employed if he merely read to the class 
a simple historical tale in the hope of fostering an 
interest in history. The successful teacher must have 
wide knowledge, both of the main events and move- 
ments in history, and of interesting details ; he must 
have an acquaintance with historical literature so that 
he may be able to acquire this knowledge ; and he 
must have an acquaintance with methods of teaching 
so that he may be able to use this knowledge to the 
best effect in the schoolroom. To give a really success- 
ful history lesson to children of 9 or 10 years of age is 
as difficult as to give one to pupils of 16 or 17. In 
some ways it is even more difficult, since the teacher 
must be careful to make his narrative simple enough 
1977 P
-P-A-G-E-226
    
226 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
to be understood, yet vivid and full enough to be 
interesting. He can only do this when he has a large 
reserve of historical knowledge which has been gradually 
acquired by consistent reading. 
Specialization in teaching is supported by one 
further argument. We profess that one of our main 
aims in the elementary school is to engender in the 
children interests which will enable them to lead fuller, 
more useful, happier lives. But this is hardly possible 
when the teacher himself, through being compelled to 
teach a dozen subjects, is unable to develop a genuine 
interest in any one of them. It is only a teacher of 
wide historical knowledge and considerable experience 
in teaching the subject who can give his pupils a real 
permanent interest in history. 
2. Specialization and an adequate supply of books 
will do little to improve the teaching of history in 
elementary schools until more time is given to this 
subject. Three or four hours a week throughout 
school life are often devoted to acquiring skill in the 
use of numbers. Even in-the upper classes at least 
five or six are usually spent in learning to read and 
write the English language. But surely, after six or 
seven years of school life so much time is not needed 
for these subjects. In a school where children of twelve 
and thirteen spend between four and five hours a week 
‘doing arithmetic and mensuration and a single period 
of forty-five minutes studying history, all notion of 
the relative values of these subjects is lost. We must 
conclude that in such cases the single lesson in history 
is a concession to meet the requirements of the Board 
of Education, and that the head master considers the 
working of innumerable examples in Practice and
-P-A-G-E-227
CONCLUSION 227 
Averages and the calculation of the surface of a cone 
or pyramid to be infinitely more important in equipping 
the children for their life in the world, than a knowledge 
of how the community in which they live came to be 
what it is. 
II. In secondary schools the problem is somewhat 
different. Here the chief hindrances to efficient work 
are the influence of external examinations upon 
schemes of work and methods of teaching, and the 
subordinate place which tradition gives to history in 
the school. . 
1. The examination evil is too obvious to detain us. 
With the prospect of an examination ahead, the teacher 
must throw aside principles and convictions in order 
that his pupils may, at an appointed time, reproduce 
just the knowledge which the examiners require. 
This knowledge is often hurriedly acquired and badly 
assimilated ; the methods of teaching are often the 
worst imaginable; and the scope of the work is often 
unduly limited to political history. Further, there is 
a tendency to concentrate attention for too long on 
a particular period to the neglect of all other periods, 
in order that a good examination result may be obtained. 
Under these circumstances the teacher can well be 
forgiven if he neglects the real educational aspect of 
his work and resorts to unworthy methods. In seeking 
to gain a long list of successes he is, after all, striving 
to add to the reputation of the school and to his chances 
of professional advancement. But these very facts are 
a sad commentary upon the effects of the present 
examination system. 
2. A further reason for ineffective history teaching 
is that it has not yet succeeded in winning the confidence 
P2 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
228 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of head masters. To many its appeal for more considera- 
tion is by no means convincing. Like literature, its 
market value is low; it has no place in the preparation 
for a commercial or professional career; it is not 
usually an avenue toa university career. But the school 
has more important aims than to give any sort of 
vocational training. Education is to a great extent 
a preparation for the right employment of leisure 
and the development of broad intellectual and social 
interests outside the scope of any business or profession. 
The training of the school. should make for culture 
rather than for business acumen; it should aim at 
giving an interest in books and in nature, a love of 
true knowledge, a recognition of social duties, an 
appreciation of national questions, rather than the 
qualities of material success. It is on these grounds 
that history and literature claim more dignified 
positions in secondary education than they hold to-day.
-P-A-G-E-229
    
APPENDIX I 
THE CULTURE-EPOCH THEORY 
Tuts doctrine, which is more popular in America and 
Germany than in England, cannot be lightly dismissed as 
an educational fad. Many great thinkers have believed 
in it, and many practical educationists have applied it 
to the school curriculum. Goethe expresses the theory in 
a few words when he says, ‘ Although the world in general 
advances, the youth must always start again from the 
beginning and, as an individual, traverse the epochs of the 
world’s culture.’! According to this view, there are epochs 
in the history of the child comparable to epochs in the 
development of the race. Before this theory can be intro- 
duced into the curriculum ‘there are, as Rein points out, 
three problems to be solved : 
1. To discover the chief epochs in the development of 
the race. 
2. To discover similar epochs in the life of the individual. 
3. To harmonize these two series of epochs. 
The attempts made to mark out these parallel series of 
epochs appear to be far from satisfactory. We all can 
recognize that the child’s mental and moral development 
is in many ways similar to that of the race. But can we 
go further than this? The advocates of this doctrine 
should be able to distinguish epochs in race history ex- 
tending from prehistoric times to the present, each epoch 
having its characteristic features. He should also be able 
to determine corresponding epochs with similar character- 
istics in the history of the individual. Those who believe 
such a task not impossible claim that the material for 
1 Quoted by Rein, Outlines of Pedagogics, p. 98.
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
instruction should be drawn from the corresponding epochs 
in the history of the race. National development, then, 
becomes the central theme of the whole curriculum.1 
The difficulties involved in such a scheme are obvious 
and have led many teachers to adopt a modified form of 
the culture-epoch theory which is limited to prehistoric 
times and young children. They emphasize the points of 
comparison, mental and moral, between young children 
and primitive man, and infer from this that the whole of 
the work in the lower classes should be based on life in 
primitive times. But serious problems still remain. We 
all know that the young boy delights to subject himself to 
conditions more or less similar to those of primitive times. 
He loves to be a cave-man or a tent-dweller, but we need 
not go to the culture-epoch theory for anexplanation. Tales 
of adventure appeal to a boy, as tales of romance appeal to 
people of all ages, not necessarily because the boy is passing 
through a period which has its corresponding epoch in the 
history of the race, but because we all delight to be trans- 
ported beyond the petty circle of our everyday experiences. 
Since also children are imitative by nature, they often 
play such games as those introducing Indians and:cowboys, 
of whose exploits they have been reading. Many children, 
especially girls, love to play at ‘ teaching ’ if they can get 
a few younger children before them, or even when they 
must be content with imaginary pupils. Many boys love 
to bedeck themselves with paper helmets and march in 
ranks. These and many other instances of children’s play 
are quite spontaneous, but, like the Red Indian game, are 
due to imitation and not to a repetition in the child of a 
characteristic of the race. 
Even if parallel series of epochs could be marked out in 
the history of the individual and of the race, it would be 
doubtful how far the child ought to be brought into touch 
1 See Rein, pp. 117-27.
-P-A-G-E-231
* APPENDIX I 231 
with the race experiences of the corresponding stage of 
development. Are the problems of the race in its infancy 
the problems of the young child? Is it true that the 
problems which children meet and ought to solve are 
similar to those solved in the early history of the race ? 
Some of the great problems of the race were the provision 
of fire, shelter, clothing, and tools, and the means of ex- 
pressing their thoughts in the form of writing. The child 
does not meet with these problems: he is the heir of all 
the ages, the inheritor of countless achievements. If, then, 
the child is to encounter the problems of primitive life, the 
teacher must create with elaborate care the atmosphere of 
early times and present these problems to the child. 
‘ Certainly the simplicity of these modes of life corresponds 
to his child-bound limitations, but the problems which the 
teacher proposes to him when representing Ab the Cave- 
dweller or Robinson Crusoe are remote from the purposes 
and motives which he finds in his modern environment.’ 4 
Suppose we believe in the reality of the comparison 
between primitive man and the young child, and in the 
advisability of making use of this comparison in the school. 
There is still the difficulty of making life in primitive times 
the centre of the curriculum. Hence some educationists 
suggest the homely occupations of everyday life, rather 
than primitive society, as the central topic for young 
children. In this way the child’s little world is expanding 
gradually ; his new experiences are real and natural, like 
the experiences of the race in its infancy ; and he is gaining 
a better foundation for his life in the world than he would 
if a considerable portion of his school time for several years 
were devoted to the study of prehistoric man. 
Quite apart from the culture-epoch theory we can select 
stories from life in primitive timesin teaching young children.

IV. Sources ror tHE EIGHTEENTH AND 
NINETEENTH CENTURIES 
No attempt is made here to compile a short list for this period. 
The volumes in Longmans’ Political History of England and 
Methuen’s History of England dealing with the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries contain full bibliographies. The actual sources 
are usually more or less inaccessible to the average teacher, but the 
collections of sources which have been already mentioned contain 
much material in handy form, whilst many illustrations, especially 
of social and industrial conditions, will be found in general contem- 
porary literature.

  APPENDIX IIT 
SHORT LIST OF GENERAL BOOKS 
1. For the political history of England two of the best recent 
works are: 
Longmans’ Political History of England (12 vols., 7s. 6d. each). 
Methuen’s History of England (7 vols., 10s. 6d. each). 
Here and there in these volumes an experienced teacher may 
gather much material of value for purposes of teaching, and much 
more which, though not of direct use for his lessons, will give him 
a fuller conception and better understanding of the nation’s develop- 
ment. 
C. R. L. Fletcher’s Introductory History of England (4 vols., 5s. 
each, Murray) is on a smaller scale. It is entertaining in style, and 
the first two volumes at least should be read from beginning to end. 
2. For social and industrial history a number of excellent school 
reading books have been published. Among those most deserving 
of mention are : 
Finnemore, Social Life in England (2 vols., 1s. 6d. each, Black), 
The Piers Plowman Histories (various prices, George Philip & 
Sons). 
F. W. Tickner, Social and Industrial History of England (Arnold, 
3s. 6d.). 
Stanley Leathes, The, People of England (3 vols., Heinemann). 
G. Collar, Industrial and Social History (Pitman, 2s.). 
G. Guest, A Social History of England (Bell, 1s. 6d.). 
The teacher should also read an outline of industrial history 
such as: 
Townsend Warner, Landmarks of English Industrial History 
(Blackie, 5s.). 
H. de B. Gibbins, The Industrial History of England (Methuen, 3s.). 
L. L. Price, English Commerce and Industry (Arnold, 3s. 6d.). 
Cunningham and McArthur, Outlines of English Industrial History 
(Camb., 4s.). 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
    
236 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
More advanced, but invaluable for reference, are the following : 
W. Cunningham, Growth of English History and Commerce (3 vols., 
Cambridge). 
Traill and Mann, Social England (6 vols., Cassell). 
Chapters on a variety of topics, e.g. state of the people, travel, 
education, navy, army, art of war, &. The last edition is well 
illustrated. 
3. For church history one of the best short books is : 
H. O. Wakeman, History of the Church of England (js. 6d., 
Rivingtons). 
Hunt and Stephens, History of the English Church (8 vols.) is the 
most up-to-date of the larger histories. 
4. A good general history of Europe is indispensable. The fol- 
lowing are among the best short works : 
G. B. Adams, Huropean History (6s., Macmillan). 
A. J. Grant, A History of Europe (7s. 6d., Longmans). 
Thatcher and Schwill, A General History of Europe, 4. D, 350-1900 
(9s., Murray). 
A larger work is Rivington’s Periods of European History by 
various writers (8 vols., 6s. each). 
5. The teacher must have some knowledge of the development of 
architecture in England. 
T. D. Atkinson, English Architecture (Methuen, 3s. 6d.) will be 
sufficiently full. 
A. H. Thompson, U'he Historical Growth of the English Parish 
Church (Cambridge Manuals of Science and Literature, 1s.) is 
another useful little book for the teacher. 
6. An historical atlas is, of course, essential. The best small ones 
are: 
Ramsay Muir, New School Atlas of Modern History (Philips, 3s.). 
8. R. Gardiner, School Atlas of English History (Longmans, 5s.). 
Putzger, Historischer Schul-Atlas, 38. 
A collection of pictorial illustrations is necessary. Simple col- 
lections are published by Horace Marshall and Messrs. E. J. Arnold 
of Leeds. Messrs. Longmans publish a series of portfolios of illus- 
trations (2s. 6d. each). 
H. W. Donald, Pictorial History of England (Charles, 3s. 6d.) is 
one of the most useful collections in book form. Lavisse and Par- 
mentier’s Album Historique (4 vols.) is a much larger work covering 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  
APPENDIX III 237 
the whole range of European history in mediaeval and modern 
times. 
7. The following list of miscellaneous books will so be found 
useful : 
Munro, Prehistoric Britain ; 
Pollard, History of England ; 
Belloc, Warfare in England ; 
Spears, Master Mariners ; 
and other volumes in the Home University Library (Williams & 
Norgate, 1s. each). 
Tsaac Taylor, Words and Places (Dent, Everyman’s Library, 1s.) for 
the historical significance of place-names. 2 
H. B. George, Historical Geography of the British Empire (Methuen, 
3s. 6d.). 
H. B. George, The Relations between History and Geography 
(Clarendon Press, 48. 6d.). 
H. B. George, Historical Evidence (Clarendon Press, 3s.). 
J. E. Morris and H. Jordan, Local History and Antiquities (Rout- 
ledge, 4s. 6d.) contains much useful information concerning material ” 
remains in various parts of England for all mertods from prehistoric 
times to the present.

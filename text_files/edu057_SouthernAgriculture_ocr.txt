SOUTHERN AGRICULTURE 
PART I 
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
PRIMITIVE man obtained his food from the fruits 
and roots of various wild plants and from the flesh 
of wild animals. Agriculture began when he first 
took thought to care for his favorite food plants and 
to plant them near his usual haunts. The first 
crops doubtless sprang from the seeds of wild fruits 
carelessly scattered near the favorite camp or rest- 
ing place. The fruits of these chance-sown plants 
were handy and easy to gather, hence the plants 
were cherished and to some extent protected from 
injury, while valueless plants would be broken down 
and destroyed. From such crude beginnings has 
modern agriculture sprung with its manifold labors 
and activities that have so wonderfully changed the 
face of the habitable part of the world, destroying 
the natural plant covering with its endless variety, 
and substituting great areas of those few plants that 
are of greatest utility to mankind. Agriculture is 
thus the propagation of plants through the inter- 
vention of man.

  2 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
CLIMATE AS EFFECTING AGRICULTURE 
The growth of wild plants is determined by two 
sets of factors, those connected with the soil and 
those connected with the climate. Cultivated plants 
are also subject to these same conditions except in 
so far as these may be modified by human effort. 
Cultivation is the collective name for all those pro- 
cesses by which man seeks to alter these environ- 
mental conditions, thus making them more favorable 
for his crops. It is easier to modify soil conditions 
than climatic conditions, hence the climate of any 
region must always profoundly influence its agri- 
culture. Climate depends on the two factors of 
temperature and humidity. A climate may be hot 
or cold, wet or dry, and the kinds of crops that can 
be grown will vary accordingly. These factors 
depend in turn on three others, — latitude, altitude, 
and topography. 
Latitude as effecting Climate. —If we start with 
the land of perpetual snow in the Arctic regions and 
travel southward, the climate will become gradually 
warmer and warmer until we reach the perpetual 
summer of the tropics. Each change in temperature 
will be accompanied by corresponding changes in 
plant and animal life. These changes are so well 
marked and conspicuous that naturalists are able to 
mark off a number of well-defined areas called life 
zones, each of which is characterized by the plants 
and animals found in it which do not occur either 
farther north or farther south. Other plants and 
animals have a wider range of adaptability.and may
-P-A-G-E-15
CLIMATE AS EFFECTING AGRICULTURE 3 
be found in more than one life zone, but even with 
these there is always a region where they thrive best 
and seem most at home. A study of these life zones 
in any country is of considerable practical impor- 
tance to the farmer, for a knowledge of the life zone 
in which he is located will show at once what the 
‘probabilities of success will be with the different 
cultivated crops. Thus in the Hudsonian zone he 
can plant potatoes, turnips, and barley, but not 
corn. In the Alleghanian he can plant corn, wheat, 
and apples, but not cotton. In the Austro-riparian 
he can plant cotton, corn, and rice, but not apples 
and wheat. 
Altitude as effecting Climate. —If we pass from 
base to summit of a high mountain, we will find that 
altitude affects temperature in exactly the same way 
as latitude. Thus on every high mountain in the 
tropics, in the course of a few miles we may traverse 
all the life zones from the tropical jungles and per- 
petual heat of the base to the perpetual snow and 
ice of the summit. In fact, it is in mountainous 
countries that these life zones are most clearly 
marked. This is due to the fact that distances are 
so much shorter and comparisons so much more 
easily made. On level lands the boundaries usually 
overlap and are indistinct, but on steep mountains 
they are often very clearly marked, one kind of vege- 
tation beginning and another ending very abruptly. 
The majority of wild animals and plants do not have 
a vertical range of more than a thousand feet. 
Topography as effecting Climate. — A careful study 
of the life zones in a mountainous country will soon 
 
-P-A-G-E-16

4 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
show that the same zone is not always to be found 
at the same altitude. The plants of the cold thickets 
up near the timber line will be found straggling 
downward for a considerable distance in shaded ra- 
vines on the northern slopes, while on the side exposed 
to the sun the plants of the hot plains at the base 
may extend upward for many hundred feet. 
In a level country like the great Mississippi Valley 
there is nothing to interrupt the free movement of 
the air, and the cold northwest winds of winter rush 
unchecked throughout its whole extent. If a great 
chain of mountains extended from east to west 
across the middle of it, these northers would to a 
great extent be deflected and the southern portion 
would have a much warmer, more equable climate. 
On the other hand the warm winds from the Gulf of 
Mexico would be prevented from reaching the upper 
portion and its climate would be correspondingly 
colder. Italy owes its warm, genial climate to the 
protection of the Alps. Small local variations in 
altitude also have a pronounced effect on climate. 
The cool air at night settles into the low places, 
while the warmer air rises about the tops of the hills. 
In driving through the country at night every one 
has noticed the chill on descending into some damp 
ravine and the pleasant warmth encountered on the 
higher ridges. Fruit growers take advantage of this 
fact and locate peach orchards and strawberry fields 
on high ground, where they will be more likely to 
escape damage from spring frosts. 
Topography is thus seen to have its effect on 
temperature, but it has an equally great effect in con-

THE SOIL 5 
trolling humidity. When a warm wind laden with 
moisture from the sea passes over the land, it becomes 
chilled in rising over high hills or mountains, since, 
as we haye seen, these are cooler than the lower levels. 
Cool air cannot contain as much moisture as warm 
air, hence part of it is squeezed out and falls as rain. 
As a rule the windward side of a mountain range is 
wet, while the leeward side is dry. We thus find 
that the east coast of Mexico and Central America, 
which is exposed to the sweep of the northeast trade 
wind, hasa heavy rainfall. In passing over the high 
mountains of the interior these warm, moist winds 
become cooled and lose their moisture, so that as they 
descend on the western side and again become 
warmed they are very dry. What are practically 
desert conditions prevail over large areas of the west- 
ern side of these countries. The same thing occurs 
in South Americaand in the more mountainous of the 
West India Islands. Porto Rico and Jamaica have 
a very heavy rainfall on the north side of the moun- 
tains, but on the southern side it is so dry that irriga- 
tion is necessary for the profitable production of most 
crops. If our hypothetical chain of mountains ex- 
tended across the Mississippi Valley, the south side 
would not only be warmer, but it would have much 
heavier rainfall, since more of the moisture from the 
Gulf would be deposited; while the northern side 
would not only be cold, but very dry. 
THE Sor 
Formation of Soils. — The earth or finely divided 
substratum in which the ordinary land plants grow

6 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
and extend their roots is called the soil. It consists 
of more or less minute rock particles mixed with de- 
composed vegetable matter. The rocks that formed 
on the cooling of the earth’s crust in the early geologi- 
cal ages soon began to be disintegrated by the action 
of rain and wind. As the cooling process continued 
the action of frost contributed largely to. the same 
end. The loosened particles, swept along by the 
torrential rainfalls of this stormy epoch, were carried 
to the sea, where they were deposited to form the 
thick beds of stratified rocks which by subsequent 
elevation and erosion have served to furnish the 
material for most of our agricultural soils of to-day. 
During the long ages of the glacial period, when so 
much of the present temperate zone was covered with 
an immense sheet oficeand snow, the slow, irresistible, 
glacier-like southward movement of the mass also 
served as a powerful means for crushing and pulveriz- 
ing the buried rocks below. From the earliest times 
running streams have been efficient agents not only for 
eroding rocks, but for transporting the disintegrated 
particles from one place and depositing them in an- 
other. As vegetation of various kinds began to ap- 
pear on the sandbars and other exposed deposits of 
these crude rock particles, the remains of the dying 
plants became mingled with the sand and silt and by 
its modifying influence served little by little to form 
a true soil. Agricultural soils may, therefore, be 
classified according to their origin as alluvial de- 
posits along streams; lacustrine deposits in the bottom 
of ponds and lakes, or the bottom of the sea, that 
have subsequently been elevated or drained by the
-P-A-G-E-21
THE SOIL 7 
movements of the earth’s crust; and glacial deposits 
left by the great ice sheet; or finally they may have 
been formed in situ by the slow weathering and de- 
composition of the underlying rocks. Bog soils are 
also worthy of special mention since they are mostly 
formed in situ from the remains of aquatic or semi- 
aquatic plants. Sand dunes and other shifting de- 
posits made by the wind usually have but. little 
agricultural value. 
Kinds of Soils. — For practical purposes soils are 
usually classified according to the size of the particles 
of which they are composed. Among farmers they 
are spoken of as gravelly, sandy, loamy, or clayey, 
and intermediate grades are expressed by combina- 
tions of these terms, as sandy-loams, loamy-clay, etc. 
Soil physicists make a more accurate classification, 
which is expressed in the following table: — 
clay, soil particles, .005 mm. or less in diameter. 
fine silt, soil particles, .01-.005 mm. in diameter. 
silt, soil particles, .05-.01 mm. in diameter. 
very fine sand, soil particles, .1-.05 mm. in diameter. 
fine sand, soil particles, .25-.1 mm. in diameter. 
medium sand, soil particles, .5-.25 mm. in diameter. 
coarse sand, soil particles, 1-.5 mm. in diameter. 
gravel, soil particles, over 1 mm. in diameter. 
In describing soils the shape of the soil particles is 
also taken into consideration. Of course most soils 
contain particles of different sizes. In making a 
mechanical analysis of a soil these particles are sepa- 
rated according to the sizes in the above table, and 
the percentage of each is determined. The adapta-
-P-A-G-E-22
8 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
bility of a soil for different crops will depend very 
largely on these percentages. 
Composition of Soils.—'The chemical composition of 
soils naturally varies quite widely according to the 
nature of the rocks from which they have been de- 
rived and the climatic influences to which they have 
been subjected. The smallest particles constituting 
the clay are usually silicate of alumina, while the 
sand is mostly silica. These two substances in vary- 
ing proportions form the great bulk of most soils, 
but they are both inert so far as supporting vegeta- 
tion is concerned. A soil containing only these two 
substances would be absolutely sterile. Combined 
with these in varying quantities are usually found 
iron, carbonates and sulphates of lime and magnesia, 
and minute quantities of phosphate of lime and of ni- 
trates, carbonates, chlorides, and silicates, of potash 
andsoda. From a chemical point of view the fertility 
of the soil mostly depends on the small amounts of ni- 
trates and phosphates and of potash which it contains. 
At least the other essential elements of plant food are 
usually sufficiently abundant in all soils, but the quan- 
tity of one or more of these three is often insufficient, 
especially in soils that have been long in cultivation. 
The solubility and therefore the availability of the 
phosphates and potash in the soil depends largely on 
the amount of vegetable matter which it contains. 
The nitrates, which may be considered the most im- 
portant of all the soil substances, are mostly derived 
from decaying organic matter, so the amount of this 
material in the soil may often be taken as an index 
of its fertility. Bog soils, however, contain so large
-P-A-G-E-23
THE SOIL 9 
a proportion of vegetable matter that the mineral 
elements are often in insufficient quantity. The 
presence of large quantities of lime in a soil gives it 
some characteristic peculiarities. ‘The name of cal- 
careous soils is applied where more than ten per cent 
of this substance is present. It usually happens 
that the surface layers of the soil contain more de- 
composed vegetable matter and so are darker colored 
than the part that lies below. This upper portion 
is called the top soil or surface soil, while the deeper 
layers are spoken of as the subsoil. The mechanical 
composition of the two is often quite different, and 
the line of demarcation between them may be clearly 
marked. The top soil may vary in depth from 
a few inches to as many feet. A deep surface soil is 
usually an indication of fertility. In some cases, as 
in the loess soils at some points along the Mississippi 
River and the red cane lands of the Tertiary period 
in the West Indies, there is no proper subsoil, since 
the surface soil extends downward practically un- 
altered for a great depth. 
Biological Activities in the Soil.—So far only the 
chemical and physical properties of the soil have been 
considered. It is also the place for innumerable 
biological activities. Instead of being the inert, 
lifeless mass that it seems, it is literally swarming 
with untold myriads of minute living beings whose 
life processes profoundly affect its composition and 
properties. Without the aid of these active but 
infinitesimal workers the soil as we know it to-day 
could never have been built up; and if their activi- 
ties should suddenly cease, its fertility would be
-P-A-G-E-24
10 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
quickly lost, never to return. These bacteria, or 
germs, as they are often called, constitute the minutest 
forms of life. They are so small that they are scarcely 
more than visible under the highest powers of the mi- 
croscope, but they occur in such numbers, their vital 
activities are so great, and they multiply so rapidly, 
that they constitute one of the most powerful factors 
in the world’s economy. They are the agents of de- 
cay. It is by their aid that refuse animal and vegeta- 
ble matter of all kinds is rotted down so that it may 
become incorporated in the soil and so become avail- 
able for the growth of useful plants. Besides the nu- 
merous kinds whose combined activities result in this 
most useful work of decomposition there are many 
others, some highly beneficial and others noxious, 
whose activities in the soil strongly influence its qual- 
ity and fertility. Some attack the ammoniacal com- 
pounds resulting from putrefaction and convert them 
into nitrites. Others in turn convert these nitrites 
into nitrates. It is only in the form of nitrates that 
our ordinary crops are able to use nitrogen as food, 
hence we see the immense practical importance of un- 
derstanding how these saltsare formed in the soil and 
of knowing how these processes may be influenced 
by different methods of cultivation. Nitrogen stored 
in the soil in other forms represents potential fertility, 
but it only becomes actual fertility after it has passed 
through those complicated changes known collectively 
as nitrification, which are produced by the combined 
action of these different living organisms and which 
result in the formation of nitrates. These nitrates 
are very soluble, and they are readily taken up in  
-P-A-G-E-25
THE SOIL 11 
dilute solutions by the absorptive surfaces of the root 
hairs found so abundantly near the ends of the young 
growing rootlets. Owing also to their extreme 
solubility, they are readily leached out of the soil 
and lost, and they are also liable to the attack of still 
other bacteria known as denitrifying organisms which 
set free the precious nitrogen and allow it to escape 
back to the great storehouse of the atmosphere. 
Losses from these two sources are often very heavy, 
and they are continually occurring in all cultivated 
soils that are not fully occupied by some actively 
growing crop, excepting of course when they are 
securely locked by the frosts of winter. The absence 
of frost and the fact that in consequence these mani- 
fold soil activities are progressing continuously 
throughout the year constitutes the chief real basic 
difference between southern and northern agricul- 
ture. This fundamental difference must always be 
kept clearly in mind when attempting to formulate 
rational agricultural practices for either region, or 
when attempting to adapt northern methods to 
southern conditions. 
Besides this great series of organisms that we have 
seen to be concerned in the breaking down and 
putrefaction of organic matter and the subsequent 
conversion of the nitrogen it contains into the 
available nitrates, there is another series of bacteria 
known as nitrogen-fixing organisms which have the 
power which none of the higher plants possess of 
seizing the free nitrogen of the air and so combining it 
with other elements as to utilize it as food. It thus 
becomes organic nitrogen, and when excreted by these

  12 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
organisms or on their death it is available for the 
growth of the higher plants after passing through 
the usual nitrifying changes. This ability to draw 
on the vast reserve of free nitrogen existing in the 
atmosphere is a matter of the utmost importance. 
The study of these biological activities in the soil 
which play so important a part in its fertility and 
consequently are so vitally important in the world’s 
progress has only recently begun to receive atten- 
tion. In the past few years many attempts have 
been made to propagate and artificially distribute 
these nitrogen-fixing bacteria and to learn the con- 
ditions which control their natural growth and in- 
crease in the soil. The problems involved are very 
complex and difficult and so far but few results 
of practical value have been obtained. The field 
remains an open one, and it is one of the most attrac- 
tive and important in the whole range of the scien- 
tific investigations by means of which this age is 
striving to explain and to improve upon the ancient 
agricultural practices of the world. 
There is one immensely important group of these 
nitrogen-fixing bacteria, however, whose activities are 
now fairly well understood and whose services are 
being utilized on a large and rapidly increasing scale. 
These organisms are parasitic on the roots of the 
numerous species of plants belonging to the bean 
and pea family or, as it is usually called, the Legumi- 
nose. Their presence causes the growth of little 
galls or swellings known as nodules or tubercles, 
and in this respect they are to some extent an incon- 
venience to the plant. The favor of being fur-
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE SOIL 13 
nished a habitation and of being provided with a 
certain quantity of the sugary material which they 
take from the plant sap is amply repaid by their 
nitrogenous excretions which are in a form to be 
quickly available to the host plant. Plants of this 
family are thus enabled to grow and thrive in soils 
that are very deficient in nitrogen, since they are 
able to obtain a sufficient supply of this most neces- 
sary material from the atmosphere through the agency 
of these minute inhabitants of their root tubercles. 
The tissues of leguminous plants are rich in nitrogen, 
and they are more useful than any others to plow 
under for green manuring, since they really add to 
the soil large quantities of this ever desirable ele- 
ment. Other green crops and weeds when plowed 
under only return to the soil what they have pre- 
viously taken from it. The fact that clover and 
other similar legumes were useful for green manur- 
ing has been known since the earliest times, but the 
reason why they are better than other kinds of plants 
for this purpose has only been known for a compara- 
tively few years. Even when crops of clover, cow- 
peas, or other similar legumes are cut and removed 
from the land, the roots and stubble contain enough 
nitrogen to be of considerable use to succeeding crops. 
This is a matter of the utmost practical importance, 
since by establishing a proper rotation and by keep- 
ing the ground continuously covered by some legu- 
minous catch crop when not occupied by the principal 
cropit is possible, at slight expense and without losing 
its use for a single season, to constantly maintain the 
nitrogen content of the soil and that without pur-
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
chasing a pound of this most expensive of the ele- 
ments of fertility. When crops are constantly taken 
from the land, however, the potash and phosphoric 
acid will at length be exhausted, no matter how great 
its original fertility, and it will become necessary to 
supply them by purchase. The important question 
of methods for maintaining or improving the fertil- 
ity of the soil will be more fully discussed in a sub- 
sequent chapter. 
Besides the exceedingly useful organisms that have 
been so briefly discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
the soil frequently harbors others that may become 
exceedingly injurious by attacking and causing dis- 
eases in our cultivated plants or our domestic ani- 
mals. As a general rule the richer a soil is in humus 
and decaying vegetable matter, the more likely it is 
to be able to support these noxious parasites, since 
some parasites are able to support life, at least for 
certain periods of their existence, on such decaying 
materials. It frequently happens that when the 
same crop is grown continuously on the same soil 
for a series of years, the land becomes so filled with 
some disease-producing organism that this crop can 
no longer be produced and its cultivation has to be 
abandoned. This again is too large a subject for 
full discussion here, but enough has been said to con- 
clusively show that the study of the biology of the 
soil is fully as important as that of soil chemistry 
and soil physies. In fact chemistry, soil physics, and 
biology with its manifold branches, especially bacteri- 
ology and vegetable physiology and pathology, are 
the scientific foundation on which all rational farm
-P-A-G-E-29
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 15 
practices must depend. Agriculture itself is a busi- 
ness, not a science, but its nature is such that in order 
to conduct it successfully a knowledge is required of 
the results obtained by the students of many sciences. 
MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 
Preparation for Crops; Clearing. —JIn a state of 
nature arable soils, at least in humid or semihumid 
regions, are always covered with a dense growth of 
natural vegetation which it is necessary to destroy 
to make room for cultivated crops. In very arid 
regions extremely fertile soils are sometimes abso- 
lutely destitute of plant covering, but this is very 
rare. On forest lands the vegetation consists almost 
wholly of trees and shrubs, and the clearing is a seri- 
ous labor; but on prairies or savannahs, where it con- 
sists entirely of grasses and other herbaceous plants, 
the whole may be turned under by the plow. The 
methods of clearing forest lands differ widely in 
different countries. In the tropics the work is 
usually very crudely done. The trees and bushes 
are hacked or chopped down with the machete or ax 
during the dry season and they are burned where 
they fall. The crop, whatever it may be, is now 
planted among the charred logs and stumps without 
any attempt at plowing the land, and such cultiva- 
tion as is given is done with the hoe or machete. 
The plow is only employed when the smaller stumps 
are rotted and the land begins to be invaded by grass. 
In temperate regions the clearing is usually rather 
more thorough. The bushes and smaller trees are

16 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
taken up by the roots with the mattock, and the land 
is plowed with a “new ground plow,” or jumping 
shovel, before the crop is planted. In either case it is 
ultimately necessary to dig out the remaining stumps 
and any large stones before the land can be fitted for 
cheap cultivation with improved modern machinery. 
Stump-pulling machines of various kinds are often

employed in this work, and the larger stumps are 
frequently split in pieces by dynamite. In most 
cases it would probably be cheaper in the long run 
to do all this work in the first place and completely 
clear the land of all obstructions before beginning to 
plant it. This, however, entails so heavy an initial 
expense that it is seldom attempted. 
Plowing. — The endless number of plows on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 17 
market may all be referred to one of the three follow- 
ing types:—shovel plows, moldboard or turning 
plows, and disk plows. The first plow was prob- 
ably little more than a crotched stick with the 
short arm of the crotch sharpened so that it could 
be dragged through the ground. In the evolution 
of the shovel plow from this primitive form a steel 
point was first added to protect the cutting end of 
the stick, and subsequently this point was flattened 
into a triangular shape and was slightly curved. 
The “Creole” or “Cuban” plow, still so much used 
in many parts of tropical America, has only reached 
the second stage in this development. It is only 
a steel-shod stick dragged through the ground. 
Shovel plows are largely used in laying off rows for 
planting and sometimes for cultivation, but they are 
but little used for the preliminary preparation of the 
land. Most modern cultivators are only gangs of 
small shovel plows. 
The turning plow is the one mostly used for 
breaking up the soil in preparing it for planting. It 
is so called because it cuts out a clean furrow slice 
and turns it more or less completely over, thus bury- 
ing all grass and weeds that are growing on the sur- 
face. It consists of a wooden or steel beam to 
which the team is attached, which corresponds to the 
long arm of the crotch in the primitive plow. To 
this is attached a standard which corresponds to the 
short arm of the crotch, and handles by which it is 
controlled by the plowman. The standard carries on 
one side a long, narrow vertical plate, the land side, 
which serves to hold the plow steadily to its work,

while on the other it has the share or point, which is 
a slightly curved steel or iron plate with a horizontal 
cutting edge which serves to cut out the furrow 
slice. It extends backward and upward to connect 
with the moldboard, which is another plate with a 
compound curve so shaped that the furrow slice is 
carried upward and is at the same time twisted over 
so that it falls wrong side up. Plows with differ- 
ently shaped moldboards are adapted for handling 
different classes of soils. In gravelly or very sandy 
soils cheap cast-iron plows are often used, as the more 
expensive but softer steel ones are quickly ground 
away and worn out by the grit. On sticky lands 
that contain much clay it is necessary to use steel 
plows because the iron ones do not scour well, the 
soft dirt sticking to the moldboard and preventing 
the proper turning of the furrow slice. 
Turning plows vary in size from those cutting a 
furrow slice only five or six inches wide to those 
cutting sixteen or eighteen inches, and they are 
adapted to be drawn by from one to as many as six 
or eight animals. The term “gang plow” is applied 
to those implements that carry two or more shares 
and moldboards arranged one behind another so that 
two or more furrows may be turned at each bout or 
turn around the field. Such implements can only 
be used on lands entirely free from obstructions. In 
the ordinary walking plows there is no mechanism 
for supporting the plow, but it is held upright and 
in place by the plowman. In riding or sulky plows 
the implement is attached to a frame that is carried 
by two or more wheels. The plowman rides and

controls the depth and position of the plow by means 
of levers. 
The disk plow is entirely new in principle. It 
consists of a large circular knife or disk of thin steel 
which is pressed into a concave shape and mounted 
so as to revolve on a central axle. It is set so that 
the sharp edge enters the soil almost vertically and 
the furrow slice is lifted and turned over by the 
concavity of the revolving disk. Disk plows are

in gangs. They are very useful for certain pur- 
poses, especially in handling sticky refractory soils 
in which ordinary turning plows do not scour 
well. 
Formerly plows were nearly always drawn by oxen. 
In tropical countries this is still the prevailing cus- 
tom. The first cost of oxen is less than that of 
horses or mules; with good pasturage they can work 
on that alone without requiring expensive grain
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
feed, and when they reach an unprofitable age for 
work, they can be fattened and sold for beef. Oxen, 
however, move slowly and cannot endure as many 
hours of continuous labor as horses and mules. 
With a good span of mules a man can easily plow 
an acre a day in ordinary soils. He will do well to 
plow half an acre with a yoke of oxen. One man 
can manage eight horses and a sulky gang plow, but 
with four yoke of cattle it requires one man on the 
plow and usually two others to manage the team. 
In countries where human labor is very cheap it 
probably still pays to use cattle; but in countries like 
the United States and Cuba, where farm wages are 
high, it is cheaper and more satisfactory to use horses 
and mules. At the South mules seem on the whole 
to stand farm labor better than horses. Where 
farming is carried on on a large scale and where the 
land is level and other conditions are favorable, steam 
power is coming to be utilized more and more for 
plowing and other farm work. Steam plows are of 
two general types: first, those where the gangs are 
drawn by locomobile engines which simply replace 
the animals and move round and round the field; and 
second, those where the gangs are attached to cables 
and are drawn back and forth across the field by a 
single stationary engine or by two which are moved 
slowly along its opposite sides. Recently the at- 
tempt is also being made with some success to adapt 
gasoline or alcohol motors such as are used for auto- 
mobiles to agricultural purposes. 
If a field is always plowed in the same manner, the 
continued turning of the furrows in one direction 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 21 
tends to pile up the dirt around the borders and to 
hollow it out in the middle of the field, where the 
center or so-called “dead furrow” comes. Occasional 
back furrowing remedies this trouble. To back fur- 
row it isnecessary to begin plowing in the middle of 
the field and turn in the opposite from the usual di- 
rection so as to continuously turn the furrows toward 
the center. By using skill in laying out the lands 
for plowing and by back furrowing when necessary 
a field may be kept quite level or high places may be 
leveled down and low ones filled up, or if the land 
is low and wet, it may be gradually built up into nar- 
row beds with open water furrows between them in 
such a way as to greatly improve the drainage. It 
is usually better to take long narrow lands rather 
than those that are short and nearly square as there 
will be much less time lost in turning. 
Great care should always be taken to see that 
plows are so adjusted as to run level and even, 
and that they turn the soil to the desired depth. 
On sulky plows these adjustments are made by 
means of the various levers. On walking plows 
the depth is regulated by adjusting the clevises at 
the end of the beam by which the team is attached. 
The lower the point of attachment, the shallower 
the plow will run. Elevating the point of attach- 
ment correspondingly deepens the furrow. Short- 
ening the traces or elevating them by adjusting the 
back bands will also serve to lessen the depth of 
the furrow. On many plows there is a secondary 
clevis by means of which the width of the furrow 
may be regulated. When the ground is in good
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
condition, a team can turn a wider furrow than 
when it is hard and dry. The skill of the plow- 
man will be shown by the care with which he makes 
all these different adjustments and varies them to 
suit changing conditions. 
Harrowing. —In the preparation of the soil the 
harrow is of almost equal importance to the plow, 
but on most farms its use is not so well understood. 
The intelligence of a farmer can be very accurately 
gauged by the skill with which he uses this imple; 
ment. In only too many cases the soil is turned up 
-in. great hard lumps by the plow and these are al- 
lowed to lie and bake for days in the sun before any 
attempt is made to break them to pieces with the 
harrow. In this condition the harrow can only 
drag the clods about or jump over them as if they 
were stones, and it is found impossible to put the 
land in fit condition for planting until after soaking 
rains. On lands that are intended for immediate 
planting the harrow should always quickly follow 
the plow. If the ground is moist enough to plow 
at all, the clods and lumps will be easily broken or 
cut to pieces by the harrow if it is used at once. 
The surface of the fine mellow earth so formed soon 
dries and forms a dust mulch which prevents the dry- 
ing out of the lower layers, and so holds enough mois- 
ture in the soil to secure the prompt germination of 
the seed. The main use of the harrow is to put the 
soil in such a physical condition that it can best 
retain moisture for the use of the crop. If, for any 
reason, a field is not planted as soon as it is pre- 
pared, the harrow should be run over it again, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 23 
freshen the surface just in advance of planting. 
This will kill many germinating weed seeds that 
would otherwise spring up in advance of the crop. 
There are many kinds of harrows adapted to 
different purposes and to different conditions of 
the soil. The following include the more important 
types: — 
The old-fashioned square or V harrow consists of 
a heavy wooden frame, made either in the form of a 
square or a V, carrying a number of strong square 
steel teeth that project downward six or eight 
inches. The team is hitched at one corner, and it 
is dragged back and forth, or round and round the 
field. It is a crude implement, but it is one of the 
best to use on rough, stumpy land, as the stout frame 
will slide around the stumps without injury. 
The slant tooth, or smoothing harrow, carries 
more numerous smaller teeth, usually in a sectional 
iron frame so arranged that the teeth may be set at

any desired angle by means of levers. This is a 
very useful tool. It scarifies and levels the surface 
without dragging out buried grass and weeds. It is 
often used after other harrows in order to give 
the land a finishing touch in advance of planting. 
With the teeth set at an easy angle it can also be

  24 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
run over the ground after the seed is planted, and, 
in the case of corn and some other crops, even after 
the plants are up, and it thus serves to give an effi- 
cient and very cheap first cultivation. 
The acme harrow consists of gangs of narrow, 
knifelike, curved steel blades, arranged with their 
cutting edges downward and adjusted to cut deeper 
or shallower by means of levers. This is a riding 
harrow. It does much the same work as the smooth- 
ing harrow, but it stirs and levels the surface of the 
soil rather more effectively. It cannot be used after 
the crop is up. 
The spring-tooth harrow has teeth made of long 
coiled bands of tempered steel, so arranged that the 
  Spring-tooth Harrow. 
free ends dig into the soil like little shovels. Their 
jerky, springy motion enables them to enter the 
ground easily, and they are very effective in fining 
it and tearing it to pieces. They are especially use- 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 25 
ful in lightening and loosening the soil after it has 
been compacted by heavy rains. An objection to 
their use, under some circumstances, is that they 
tend to throw buried grass and weeds to the surface. 
At other times this is an advantage. These harrows 
can be used successfully on rough, rocky, and stumpy 
ground, since when one of the limber teeth encoun- 
ters an obstruction, it straightens out and slips over

it, and then springs back into shape. These im- 
plements are made either as riding or walking 
harrows. 
Disk harrows are similar in principle to disk 
plows, but the disks are smaller, usually twelve to 
sixteen inches in diameter, and a number of them 
are mounted side and side on one axle. In the 
usual form of the implement two such gangs of from 
four to eight disks each are mounted so that they 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  26 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
can be set by means of levers to work at any desired 
angle to each other. If the gangs are set straight, 
that is, with their axes in the same direction, the 
disks will simply cut lines in the soil, but it will not 
be moved and broken. The sharper the angle at 
which the gangs ‘are set, the more the disks will 
push and turn the dirt, throwing it in each direction 
from the center. To keep the land level it is neces- 
sary to drive so as to lap half, that is, so that the 
outer end of one of the gangs, the second trip, will 
pass where the center of the machine passed the first 
trip. In this way the soil will be worked first out 
and then back, and it will be left in very fine con- 
dition. This is always a riding harrow. The disks 
may be solid or cut away in wide notches. The disk 
harrow will cut up sod, and cut and grind up clods, 
better than any of the others. In almost all cases it 
is the best implement to put immediately behind the 
plow. One should be included in the equipment 
of every farm where the land has been sufficiently 
cleared to admit of its use. It is an awkward im- 
plement to use among stumps and large rocks. In 
fact, every farm should be equipped with more than 
one kind of harrow. The disk should follow the 
plow, and on the same day that the land is plowed; 
but to secure a really good, fine seed bed, it is neces- 
sary on most soils to follow the disk with the acme, 
or the smoothing, harrow. This, as a rule, should 
be done just in advance of planting. If light rains 
have fallen between the two harrowings, so much 
the better, as the surface will pulverize better and 
the lower layers will be somewhat compacted so as
-P-A-G-E-41
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 27 
to hold moisture better. If, however, a heavy rain 
has fallen and the land is much compacted, it may 
be necessary to re-disk it, or to dig it up with the 
spring tooth. 
Rolling and Dragging. — A roller is a heavy cyl- 
inder mounted so that it can be rolled over the land. 
It is used for crushing clods and also for compact- 
ing the soil when it has been left too loose and open 
by the plow. It requires good judgment to know 
when a roller can be profitably used. If harrowing 
has been properly done, there will be no large clods

to crush, and the roller is simply used for firming 
and compacting the soil. In some kinds of soil if 
no rain falls for a considerable period after plowing, 
there is danger that all of the plowed soil may dry 
out since the air spaces are too large for the mois- 
ture to rise from below by capillarity. Seeds 
planted under these conditions would fail to germi- 
nate. Passing a heavy roller over such a field soon 
after it was plowed would press the particles closer 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  28 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
together so as to restore capillary action and the 
stirred soil would be moistened from the subsoil be- 
low, and seed would be much more likely to ger- 
minate promptly. The compacting of the surface, 
however, favors evaporation, and the danger now 
is, if the drought continues, that the reserve mois- 
ture of the subsoil will be all pumped up and 
evaporated so that the young plantlets will suffer. 
To avoid this trouble it is usually best, when it is 
found necessary to use the roller, to follow this 
implement with the smoothing harrow to break up 
the compacted surface and restore a dust mulch. 
Of course plowed land should never be rolled when 
itis wet. Grass land is sometimes rolled when quite 
wet in the early spring to settle plants into the 
ground that have been lifted by freezing or to 
bury small stones out of the way of the mowing 
machine. 
A plank drag, or leveler, is sometimes used after 
harrowing instead of the roller. This crushes clods 
and fines and levels the surface even better than

the roller and leaves it in nice condition for a seed 
bed. On most soils it is preferable to the roller. It 
is an inexpensive implement that can be made by any 
farmer out of a few pieces of two-inch plank. 
Furrowing or Bedding. — The soil being now pre-
-P-A-G-E-43
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 29 
pared for planting by plowing and harrowing and 
if necessary rolling or dragging, the next proceed- 
ing will depend on the nature of the crop and the 
character of the soil. If crops are to be planted 
broadcast, the seed will now be sown and it will be har- 
rowed in. No tillage is possible, as a rule, with broad- 
cast crops, so that this completes the labor until the 
harvest. If small grain is to be drilled instead of 
broadcasted, the land is now ready for the drill. For 
most crops, that are to be planted in rows, like corn, 
no further preparation is necessary, but the seed drill 
is run over the level land, or a light furrow is opened 
and the seed dropped by hand. For cotton, how- 
ever, and for most vegetable crops on wet lands the 
soil is bedded up before planting by throwing two 
furrows together and running the planter on top of 
the low ridge thus formed. If the beds are too high, 
they can be partially leveled with the drag. 
For sugar cane, however, on well-drained lands and 
for many other crops in dry countries the practice is 
just the reverse. A deep furrow is opened with a 
double moldboard plow or lister, the seed is planted 
in the bottom of the furrow and is lightly covered, 
the planting furrow being gradually filled in by till- 
age as the crop grows. On light friable soils the 
preliminary plowing and harrowing is often dis- 
pensed with for such crops as corn and cotton, the 
listing furrow being opened or the bed thrown up 
with the soil in the condition left by the previous crop. 
This, of course, saves much labor, but it is not prac- 
ticable on heavy refractory soils. If fertilizers are 
used, they should be applied so as to be incorporated

in the beds or be worked into the soil in the bottom 
of the planting furrow. 
Tillage. — This term is employed for all those 
operations by which the soil is stirred about grow- 
ing plants. The word “cultivation” is often used 
as the equivalent of tillage, but in reality it has a 
broader meaning and covers not only this, but all 
the other processes required in the production of 
crops. ‘Tillage is beneficial and for most crops posi- 
tively necessary for the following reasons. First, it 
kills weeds. This is its most obvious utility and un- 
fortunately it is the only one that is understood by 
many farmers. All plants that come up of their own 
accord in cultivated fields or in grass lands are 
termed weeds. In fertile soils, especially if care- 
lessly tilled, they usually spring up in great numbers. 
They are very harmful, especially when the crop is 
young and small, since they not only rob it of the 
needed plant food and soil moisture, but by their 
ranker growth they crowd and smother it by shut- 
ting out light and air. Killing weeds is thus an ab- 
solute necessity. Careful farmers will always see to 
it that all weeds are killed before they produce seed. 
In this way in the course of a few years their num- 
bers can be very sensibly reduced. 
While the killing of weeds is thus the most obvious 
necessity for tillage, it is by no means its only or 
perhaps its chief benefit. The roots of plants re- 
quire air as well as moisture for their normal devel- 
opment. ‘Tillage breaks the hard crusts formed on 
the surface of most soils after rains and allows the 
oxygen of the air to enter it freely and also provides 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 31 
for the escape of the surplus carbonic acid that is 
constantly being formed in the soil from the decay 
of organic matter. 
This free interchange of gases between the soil 
and the atmosphere is necessary, not only for the 
normal growth of roots, but for the carrying on of 
all those manifold biological activities already re- 
ferred to on which the fertility of the soil so largely 
depends. Tillage, therefore, not only kills weeds and 
provides an abundant supply of oxygen to the roots, 
but it actively promotes nitrification and all those 
other complex chemical changes induced by the 
growth of bacteria by means of which vegetable 
matter and other potential plant foods in the soil be- 
come soluble and available for the growth of plants. 
This unfortunately is not an unmixed benefit. Sol- 
uble plant food that is not at once absorbed by the 
roots is in danger of being washed or leached away 
by the rains. This, in fact, is constantly taking 
place. The fact should never be lost sight of that 
while tillage is absolutely necessary for the produc- 
tion of good crops, it also rapidly depletes soil fer- 
tility. When land is constantly devoted to tilled 
crops, active measures must at the same time be taken 
for adding in some manner to its supply of vegetable 
matter and other plant foods, or its fertility will be 
rapidly exhausted. This is especially true of tropi- 
cal or subtropical countries where these soil activities 
continue unchecked throughout the year. 
Finally and perhaps most important of all, tillage 
aids materially in conserving the moisture of the 
soil during dry weather. The fertility of a soil
-P-A-G-E-46
  82 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
depends quite as much on its consistency and water- 
holding capacity as on its chemical composition. 
During and after a heavy rain there is, of course, a 
movement of the water downward through the soil. 
This movement is due to the force of gravity. Its 
amount and rapidity will depend on the character 
and fineness of the soil particles and on their 
arrangement. Water sinks much more readily into 
a loose mellow soil than into one that is hard and 
compact. Not all the water, however, that falls on a 
soil passes through it. The attraction of each soil 
particle is sufficiently strong to hold against the 
force of gravity a thin film of water covering its 
entire surface. The smaller the soil particles, the 
greater will be their aggregate surface and the 
greater, consequently, will be the amount of moisture 
so retained. When the rain ceases and the surplus 
water has settled into the lower levels, a counter up- 
ward movement of moisture begins. The surface 
particles of the soil lose their film of moisture by 
evaporation. The soil having been compacted by 
the rain, these particles are in close contact with 
those below and a portion of the film of water which 
surrounds these lower particles arises by what is 
called capillary attraction to replace the moisture lost 
by evaporation, just as the oil in a lamp wick rises to 
replace that which is consumed in the flame. These 
lower particles that have now become partially dried 
call in turn on those below and thus a capillary 
pumping process is set up that if unchecked, will, in 
time, return to the atmosphere all of the moisture 
thus held in suspension in the soil. If, however, a
-P-A-G-E-47
ii aa cli ila ii 
MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 35: 
cultivator be passed over the land, stirring the soil to 
the depth of a few inches, the soil particles will be 
torn apart so that this capillary pumping system 
is broken up and the dried particle can no longer 
reach down and help itself from the moisture film of 
its neighbor. The result is that the surface soil that 
has been stirred dries out very quickly, but this 
layer of loose dry soil acts as what is called a “dust 
mulch” and protects the lower undisturbed portion 
from drying, in just the same way that a mulch of 
straw or of coarse manure would effect the same 
object. The growth of our crops depends almost en- 
tirely on this film of moisture that is retained by the 
soil particles. The root hairs which develop in 
such immense numbers near the tips of the youngest 
rootlets appress themselves close to the soil particles 
and are able to absorb moisture from this film to- 
gether with the small amount of soluble material 
which it has taken up from the soil. It is in this 
way, and in this way only, that plants are able to 
supply themselves with the necessary mineral food 
elements, and with the excessively important ni- 
trates, and it is from these films only that the neces- 
sary moisture is obtained to maintain the turgidity 
of the cells, supply the large amount lost by trans- 
piration, and provide for all the manifold activities of 
life. If the soil contains too much water, so that the 
spaces between the particles are filled with it instead 
of with air, these absorptive root hairs perish for 
want of oxygen. If the films lose too much water 
from surface evaporation, the root hairs can no 
longer absorb it in sufficient quantities, and growth

ceases or the plants may even wilt and finally die. 
We thus see the great importance of doing every- 
thing possible to provide, first, for drainage to 
prevent the soil from becoming water-logged and, 
second, for the conservation of moisture to prevent 
the drying up of these films of so-called hygrostatie 
moisture on which the growth of our crops so com- 
pletely depends. Tillage is our most efficient means 
for accomplishing this latter purpose, since a mellow 
tilled soil takes in all the water that falls in a light 
rain, while much of it runs off from the surface of a 
hard soil and is lost ; and the stirring of the surface 
after a rain largely prevents the loss of water by 
evaporation. It should be the general rule on every 
farm to stir the ground around growing crops as soon 
after every rain as it can be worked without injury. 
The man who waits for a crop of weeds to grow be- 
fore he cultivates fails to secure the greatest benefit 
from his labor. 
The above remarks do not apply with such force 
in those tropical countries where there is a well- 
marked rainy season, since the rainfall is sufficiently 
frequent and abundant to insure a constant supply 
of moisture for many months. Here on fertile, virgin 
lands enormous crops are produced without any pre- 
tense at tillage. Even here, however, tillage eventu- 
ally becomes necessary in order to mellow and aérate 
the soil and as being the most economical means of 
killing weeds. When crops are to be grown during 
the dry season, it becomes absolutely indispensable, 
although unfortunately its importance does not seem 
as yet to be appreciated in those countries.

Implements of Tillage. —In small gardens the hoe 
and rake are the principal instruments for tillage. 
Various forms of wheel hoes are also used for tilling 
such field crops as sugar beets and onions that re- 
quire to be worked while very small and which 
are planted in narrow rows. Labor with hand im- 
plements is, however, too expensive to be employed 
for most farm crops, and it is necessary to utilize 
  
  Goose-neck Hoe and Eye Hoe. 
implements that are drawn by animals. In those 
tropical countries where labor is cheap the greater 
economy of using such implements is not yet fully 
understood, and many fields of tobacco and sugar 
cane may be seen that are still cultivated entirely by 
hand labor. The only places where this should be 
considered permissible is on new or very rough 
lands where implements drawn by animals cannot be 
used. 
For such crops as corn, potatoes and sugar cane, 
when the land is in good condition and free from 
trash or obstructions, the best implement to use for 
the first cultivation is the smoothing harrow with 
the teeth set at an easy angle so that they will not

36 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL oT 
dig too deeply into the soil. If used at the right 
stage of growth, it can be dragged over the young 
plantlets with almost no injury, while the surface of 
the soil will be left fine and mellow and the young 
weeds will be destroyed. This gives a very cheap 
and very effective tillage. By the time another 
working is needed the plants will be big enough so 
that the two-horse riding cultivator can be used. 
This implement straddles the row, and it carries two 
gangs of small shovels so arranged that they can be 
guided by the feet of the driver. The ground on 
both sides of the row is thoroughly stirred by one 
trip through the field, and enough fine dirt falls be- 
tween the plants to cover and kill any small weeds 
that have found lodgment there. When this im- 
plement is properly used at frequent intervals, very 
little hoeing or other hand work will be required to 
keep a field clean of weeds and in good tilth until 
such a time as the crops shade the ground and tillage 
is no longer possible. Different sizes and shapes of 
shovels can be used on the gangs and they can be set so 
as to throw more or less dirt to the row. In some im- 
plements disk gangs may also be substituted for shovel 
gangs. This is the most universally useful imple- 
ment for tillage and is adapted to a wide range of 
crops. There are, however, many others. A cheap 
walking cultivator drawn by one horse is very com- 
monly used, especially on small farms. The usual 
form has five small shovels. The outer shovel on each 
side may be replaced by curved steel plates that scrape 
the dirt either from or toward the row. It is then 
called a horse hoe. The implement is usually made

  38 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
so that it can be adjusted in width to suit narrow or 
wide rows, but it is usually necessary to run it twice 
in each middle in order to do thorough work. When 
cotton, tobacco, or vegetables are grown on a low bed 
or ridge, as is commonly the case in the South, a simple 
one-horse implement, known as a “heel sweep,” is 
very much used. This consists of an ordinary single- 
shovel plow stock with a small “ bull-tongue ” shovel 
to make it run steady 
in the ground, and 
bolted on under this 
point a narrow V- 
shaped band of steel 
about two or. three 
inches wide. This 
blade varies in size

work to be done, 
from eight or ten to as much as twenty inches. 
When in use, the point is held in the ground at the 
base of the ridge or bed and the handles are leaned 
away from it enough so that one wing of the sweep 
will cut along about an inch under the surface of the 
bed. This mellows the surface and kills all weeds 
without tearing down the ridge. It is a very simple 
but very useful implement. 
Formerly small turning plows were much used in 
tillage, but they are expensive in the matter of labor, 
as it takes several furrows to plow out a middle. 
They stir the ground too deeply, cutting many roots 
and allowing too large a portion of the soil to become 
dried out, and their use tends to ridge up the rows 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL 39 
more than is desirable except on very wet lands. 
Where there is no trouble on account of drainage, 
level cultivation is always to be preferred, since level 
land presents a less surface for evaporation than when 
it is thrown into sharp ridges. 
All authorities now agree that while the prepara- 
tion of the soil should be deep and thorough, tillage 
should be shallow and frequent, and that the surface 
should be left as nearly level as the necessity for sur- 
face drainage will permit. 
Mulching. — In some special cases mulching with 
straw or other coarse litter may be resorted to instead 
of tillage for the purpose of conserving the soil 
moisture and preventing the growth of weeds. A 
mulch is often used about fruit trees and with small 
fruits, but as a rule it is too expensive for use with 
field crops. A permanent mulch has the disadvan- 
tage of tending to induce the formation of feeding 
rootlets near the surface of the ground, while tillage, 
on the contrary, tends to keep them down below the 
part of the soil that is usually stirred. What is in 
effect a temporary mulch is often cheaply provided by 
planting some quick-growing plant as a cover crop. 
Later when this cover crop is plowed into the soil, 
it furnishes the organic matter that is so constantly 
needed for maintaining its fertility. Tillage is usually 
necessary during the period when the crop is making 
its most rapid growth, but at all other times the land 
should as far as possible be protected by some cover 
crop to take up the elements of fertility rendered 
soluble by the tillage and which would otherwise be 
leached out from the soil and lost. The alternation
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
of short periods of tillage with cover crops is the best 
possible form of management for most agricultural 
soils. 
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 
Some soils are in their natural condition exceed- 
ingly well fitted for the production of crops. Others 
require to be altered and improved in one or more 
directions before they can be made to yield profit- 
able returns. 
Drainage. —Some of the richest soils are low and 
flat, and in their natural condition crops are injured 
by too much water. <A water-logged soil can never 
be productive. In such cases improvement by drain- 
age becomes a first necessity. Drains are of two 
kinds, open ditches or surface drains and underdrains. 
The amount of ditching required to properly drain a 
piece of wet land will depend on many things. If 
the land is low and is flooded by water running down 
from above, a single ditch dug along the upper side to 
divert the surface water may be all that is necessary. 
If, however, the land is inclined to be boggy from 
water that rises up from below through the subsoil, 
deep ditches at comparatively frequent intervals will 
be required. Ditches should always be carefully 
laid out with a level so as to give them a gradual but 
uniform fall in order that they may carry off the 
water promptly. In laying out a system of ditches 
it is necessary to give careful consideration to 
the matter of securing a free outlet for the water. 
In very flat level countries it is sometimes necessary 
to dig large canals for a considerable distance in 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 41 
order to secure a proper outlet for drainage ditches. 
If the slope of the land will permit, ditches should 
always be laid out parallel with each other as the 
land between them will be so much easier plowed and 
cultivated. The shape of the ditch will depend on 
the character of the soil and also on the kind of tool 
used in making it. In stiff soils a ditch with per- 
pendicular banks will often stand very well, and 
this form is most economical when dug by hand. 
Other soils cave so badly that it is necessary to give 
the banks a very easy slant. Ditching by hand with 
spade and shovel is laborious and expensive. Where 
the nature of the soil will permit, shallow ditches can 
be quickly and cheaply made with the plow, followed 
by a V-shaped scraper made from one long and one 
short plank. The long plank acts as a rudder and 
holds the scraper straight in the furrow, while the 
short arm pushes the dirt out on to the bank. By 
giving two or three plowings and scrapings a fairly 
deep ditch may be dug. A road-grading machine 
drawn by six horses will, where the land is free from 
obstructions, do still cheaper and quicker work. 
When deeper canals are required, the bottom must be 
finished by pulling out the dirt with the steel scrapers 
used by railroad contractors. 
Open ditches are very useful and often indispensa- 
ble, especially for the larger central drains, and their 
first cost is much less than that of a proper system of 
underdrainage, but they are objectionable for many 
reasons. They take up much room, and it is difficult 
to keep the waste land along the banks free from nox- 
ious weeds. They prevent passing freely about the

fields, and when large, necessitate heavy expense for 
bridges. The annual cost for cleaning out and keeping 
in order is very considerable. For all these reasons 
        
  Draintile and Tile Hoe. 
it is usually cheaper and more satisfactory in the 
long run to go to the expense of laying underdrains. 
Temporary underdrains are sometimes made by filling 
in the bottoms of ditches with poles or loose rocks 
and covering them, or by inverting a wooden gutter
-P-A-G-E-57
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 43 
in the bottom of the ditch and covering it. The 
only satisfactory underdrain, however, is made with 
the regular cylindrical draintile manufactured from 
brick clay. These tiles are made of any desired 
diameter, in pieces one foot long. A narrow ditch 
is dug, the bottom is carefully graded and shaped 
with a special implement known as a tile hoe, and 
the lengths of tile are laid in end to end and are 
carefully covered. The water enters between the 
joints, and when properly laid, the grade is such that 
the water flows evenly without depositing sediment 
to fill up the tile, and the work once well done is 
good for an almost indefinite period. The whole field 
may now be plowed and planted, and there are no 
unsightly ditch banks to breed troublesome weeds. 
The water, in working its way down through the 
soil to the drains, leaves little passages by which the 
air can enter so that underdrained soils are always 
better aérated and mellower than those with open 
drains. In consequence, they can also withstand 
droughts much better. 
A competent drainage engineer should be consulted 
in laying out a system of underdrains, and the work 
of laying the tiles should not be undertaken by per- 
sons without instruction or experience. Tile drainage 
is as yet very little practiced in Southern countries. 
The conditions on many of the sugar-cane lands are 
such that it would unquestionably prove to be a 
profitable investment, and the time will doubtless 
come when it will be much more generally used. 
Terracing. — While the South is thus somewhat 
backward in the matter of utilizing tile drainage, it 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
is here that we must look for the best practice in 
improving hillside lands by terracing. The cotton 
growers of the hilly uplands have adopted this 
system very widely and with great success to 
prevent the terrible loss from erosion or washing 
that always occurs when light, friable, hillside soils 
are carelessly tilled. Two methods to avoid loss 
from washing are adopted by the cotton farmer. 
The first is called circling the rows. Instead of 
laying out the rows in straight lines running up and 
down the hills, as is so often carelessly done, a row is 
first carefully laid out on a grade or contour line 
so that all parts of it shall be exactly on the same 
level. Such a row will circle in and out along an 
irregular hillside in a way that is sufficiently per- 
plexing to one unaccustomed to this method. Other 
rows are then run parallel to this first one, and short 
ones are introduced, whenever necessary, to keep the 
rows strictly on contour lines. Such crooked rows 
look very peculiar and unbusinesslike to the farmer 
from the level prairies, and the system is open to the 
objection that cultivation is only possible in one 
direction; but when the laying out is properly done, 
it unquestionably does much to prevent the terrible 
loss from washing that is the bane of the hillside 
farmer. 
This circling of the rows is regarded as a more or 
less temporary expedient. When it is intended to 
make a permanent improvement, the hillsides are 
laid out in terraces. To do this it is usual to start 
at the bottom of the hill and with a surveyor’s level 
lay out a contour line, marking it with small stakes  
-P-A-G-E-59
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 45 
at frequent intervals. A point three feet higher 
than the first terrace line is now measured with the 
level, and a second contour line is staked out as be- 
fore. This process is continued until the entire field 
is staked out with contour lines, one located three 
feet vertically above the other. The spaces between 
these lines will, of course, vary greatly in width 
according to the steepness of the slope. Where the 
hills are steep, the terrace lines will run close together, 
and where the slope is gentle, they will be much 
farther apart. With a large two-horse turning plow 
a double-back furrow is now thrown against each 
line of stakes, throwing up as high a ridge as possible. 
This is intended to act as a dam to hold back all the 
water that falls on the terrace above and make it 
sink into the ground, instead of running rapidly 
down over the surface. This not only prevents 
washing, but tends to accumulate a store of moisture 
in the soil for the use of the crops. The land be- 
tween the terrace lines is now plowed with a reversa- 
ble hillside plow, so that all the furrows are turned 
downhill. The first row is now laid out along the 
terrace line and the others are located parallel with 
it, filling in the broader parts of the terraces with 
short rows on the upper side. The success of the 
system will depend on the skill with which the con- 
tour lines were laid out in the first place and the 
promptness with which any breaks in the terraces are 
repaired after unusually heavy rains. If the lines 
are not properly run, water will be sure to accumulate 
and break over at the lowest places. Badly laid out 
terraces do more harm than good. The continued  
-P-A-G-E-60
  46 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
plowing with the hillside plow, year after year, con- 
stantly tends to build up the outer line of the ter- 
race and cut down the inner one, so that ultimately 
the terrace becomes nearly level. This system, when 
carefully followed, has much to recommend it, and it 
should be much more widely adopted in all hilly re- 
gions. It is to be especially recommended for per- 
manent plantings like orchards and vineyards. Coffee 
plantations are usually made in steep hill lands, and 
they should always be planted on some modification 
of this system. 
On very heavy hillside soils, in regions where the 
rainfall is excessive and the question of surface 
drainage has to be considered, it is sometimes best 
to lay out the rows or the terrace lines with a slight 
but gradual fall, so as to slowly carry off the surplus 
water instead of trying to hold it and make it all 
sink into the ground. It isa difficult matter, how- 
ever, to lay out the rows so that the water will run 
freely and still not run fast enough to wash. While 
the system is theoretically an ideal one, it seldom 
works satisfactorily in practice, and it should only be 
adopted after full consideration and usually after 
some preliminary trials. The amount of slope to 
give the rows will depend entirely on the nature of 
the soil, and the amount of the surplus rainfall. 
Irrigation. — There are many regions where the 
soils are well adapted to agricultural purposes, but 
where the rainfall is insufficient or too irregularly 
distributed to admit of the production of crops. In 
fact it is a general rule that the richest lands are 
found in dry countries where they have not been 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 47 
subjected to continued washing and leaching. All 
that is needed to make these lands exceedingly 
productive is the artificial application of water. 
This, when done on a considerable scale, is known 
as irrigation. The name would hardly be applied 
to the process of sprinkling small plots in a garden. 
Many of the most famous agricultural regions are 
entirely dependent on irrigation for the production 
of crops. It has been practiced for untold centuries 
in Egypt, India, and China, and was used by the 
Aztecs of Mexico long before the time of Columbus. 
At the present day it is largely practiced in all these 
countries, in Spain and Italy, in Hawaii, some of 
the West India islands, and on the west coast of 
Central and South America. Its most important 
recent development, however, is in the drier parts 
of the western United States, where great areas of 
what formerly appeared on the maps as “ The Great 
American Desert” have been redeemed and brought 
into profitable production. The work of building 
reservoirs and of developing and controlling the 
water supply in the West has now been taken up by 
the national government and the development of 
irrigation farming is likely to be still more rapid 
in the future than it has been in the past. ; 
At present irrigation is for the most part confined 
to what are known as the arid regions, where the 
rainfall is insufficient to produce crops. There are 
many other regions, however, where the rainfall is 
rather scanty, at least in what are known as dry 
years, or that are subject to long droughts that injure 
crops, where irrigation might be profitably employed
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
on special occasions to supplement the rainfall or 
with special crops like rice that need an abundant 
water supply at a certain period of growth. There 
is no doubt that in the future irrigation will be 
much more extensively practiced in what are known 
as humid regions. 
In those parts of the tropics where there is a well- 
marked wet and dry season the rainfall is ample or 
even excessive for a part of the year, but is insufficient 
for the best growth of crops at other seasons. Since 
here the temperature conditions are suited to growth 
at all seasons the annual production could be greatly 
increased by supplying irrigation during the dry 
season. This has already been done in certain 
localities with very favorable results. 
Water for irrigation purposes is obtained in various 
ways. Thesimplest and cheapest method, where this 
is possible, is to utilize the water of running streams. 
The water is diverted from the stream by means of a 
small dam at some point far enough up so that it is 
high enough to secure a free but not rapid flow in 
the canal which leads it to the land to be irrigated. 
The intake of the canal is so arranged that in time of 
flood only the usual amount is admitted, the surplus 
passing down the old channel. A gate is also pro- 
vided by which all the water may be cut off from the 
canal when it is necessary to clean it or make re- 
pairs. From the main canal the water is distributed 
to the fields in ditches that are laid out according to 
the topography in such a way that the ditch always 
passes along the highest side of the field which is to 
be watered from it. The ditches are provided with
-P-A-G-E-63
CL ee mm eT eee 
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 49 
a system of gates so that the water can be run to or 
cut off from any part of the lands at pleasure. The 
length of the main canal and the cost of canal and 
ditches will, of course, depend on the topography of 
the region and on the character of the soil. Some soils 
dig easily and yet hold water in the ditches well. Here 
construction is cheap and easy. In rough broken 
countries it is often necessary to carry the canals or 
ditches over ravines or rocky places in flumes built 
of lumber. In other regions there are places where 
much of the water sinks into the ground and is lost. 
Here it is necessary to line the ditches with clay or 
sometimes even with cement. All this adds to the 
cost of construction. 
Where no running streams are available, it is often 
possible to provide water for irrigation by building 
large dams across ravines in such a way as to make 
reservoirs for catching and holding the water from 
occasional rainstorms. The rain that falls in dry 
countries usually comes in the form of heavy showers, 
so that most of it runs off quickly from the hard, 
baked ground, forming temporary floods in the ravines 
and dry water courses. The catching and impound- 
ing of this storm water is more expensive than 
utilizing a running stream, but there are vast areas 
that can be irrigated in no other way, and there is no 
question but with the increase in value of agricultural 
lands more and more of these irrigation reservoirs 
will be built. In the case of running streams the 
building of storage reservoirs for holding the waste 
water largely increases the capacity of the stream 
for irrigation. Water from reservoirs is distributed 
E  
-P-A-G-E-64
50 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
to the land by a system of canals and ditches with 
gates in the same way described above. 
In some parts of the West considerable areas are 
now being irrigated from flowing artesian wells. 
Where artesian water can be obtained, it makes an 
ideal supply for irrigation. The irrigation farmer 
who holds lands under a ditch system is, to a certain 
extent, dependent on the water company who owns 
the ditches. He must take his turn with his neigh- 
bors and take and utilize the water when he can get 
it, not always when he would most like to have it. 
The fortunate owner of an artesian well is, however, 
independent. He can use his water how and when 
he pleases. It is usual to pipe the water from the 
well into a small reservoir located on the highest 
part of the farm. From here it is taken out in 
ditches or sometimes carried out in pipes, according 
to the way in which it is to be utilized. 
There are many other regions where there is an 
abundant underground flow of water, but where the 
pressure is insufficient to cause it to rise to the sur- 
face. Here it is possible to sink wells and irrigate 
by pumping. This is being done more and more on 
the Western plains. Windmills are utilized very 
largely for pumping water for stock and for irrigat- 
ing small plots, but the supply that can be obtained 
in this way can hardly be depended on for general 
farming. It is usually necessary to employ either 
gasoline or steam pumps. The cost of this, and, 
therefore, the extent to which irrigation by pumping 
can be utilized, depends on the two factors, the depth 
of the water and the cost of fuel. Low-lying lands
-P-A-G-E-65
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 51 
near rivers and lakes are often irrigated by pumping, 
where it is not feasible to take the water out in 
ditches. Where the distance to be lifted is small 
and fuel cheap, the powerful pumps now in use make 
this method of irrigation practicable on a large scale. 
Much of the rice land in western Louisiana and east- 
ern Texas is irrigated in this manner. In irrigation 
by pumping the water may be run directly into the 
ditches, or it may first be stored in reservoirs. The 
latter is the more usual practice with small pump- 
ing plants. 
In southern California and some other mountain- 
ous countries water for irrigation is obtained by 
drifts or tunnels dug back into the hills until some 
underground water channel is tapped. The water 
runs out of such a well as this by gravity and thus 
obviates the necessity for pumping. It is, of course, 
only under exceptional circumstances that this 
method can be employed, but such a “ water mine ” 
may be exceedingly valuable, for in arid regions it 
is the control of the water supply rather than the 
ownership of the land that carries the greatest value. 
Whatever the source of the water, there are 
various methods of applying it to the land. Where 
the supply is abundant, especially with such broad- 
cast crops as alfalfa and the small grains, the more 
usual method is by flooding the entire surface. In 
order to do this successfully the land must have 
been carefully prepared before planting and all the 
minor inequalities leveled down so as to allow of 
the even flow of the water. Temporary openings 
are made in the ditch bank and the water is allowed
-P-A-G-E-66
52 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
to run first in one place and then in another until 
the entire field has been covered. A modification of 
this method consists in the throwing up of borders 
or ridges with the plow at right angles to the course 
of the ditch at intervals of three or four rods. 
These borders are smoothed up and pressed into 
shape with a V-shaped plank drag. The ground be- 
tween the borders is dragged down level, and in 
irrigating the water is turned into one or two of 
these spaces and is allowed to run till it reaches the 
lower side of the field, when it is cut off and turned 
into the next spaces. This is a very practical 
method of irrigation and it is much used for quite a 
variety of crops. The distance to which the water 
can be run across such a field will depend on the 
nature of the soil and the amount of fall. With 
everything favorable a square forty-acre field can be 
irrigated from one head ditch, but in the majority 
of cases it is better to have ditches every forty or 
sometimes as close as every twenty rods. When the 
attempt is made to carry the water too far, it takes so 
long as to waste the time of the irrigator, and the land 
at the upper end next the ditch will be under water 
so long as to injure the crop. 
In orchards and gardens, especially when the water 
supply is scanty, a system of basin irrigation is often 
followed. The land is divided into small areas and 
a border is put up on all sides of each area. The 
water is turned into the upper area until it has all 
the borders will hold. After it has stood long 
enough to soak in to the desired depth the border is 
cut and the water is allowed to run into the next 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL oo 
basin, this being repeated until the entire field has 
been flooded. It is possible in this way to wet the 
land very thoroughly, and it has advantages for 
certain purposes. It seems to be a favorite method. 
with the small Mexican farmers in the Western 
states. The flooding of rice lands is managed in 
much the same way, except that for this crop the 
water is held on the land for a considerable period. 
With crops that are grown in rows, what is called 
row or furrow irrigation is often practiced. This 
requires less water than flooding the entire surface. 
Sometimes, as is usually the case with sugar cane, the 
row is planted in the bottom of a deep furrow that 
afterward serves for irrigation. With more deli- 
cate plants the row is planted on a low ridge and the 
space between the rows serves as the irrigation fur- 
row. If the rows are far apart, as in orchards and 
vineyards, an irrigation furrow is opened near the 
row on one or both sides. Furrow irrigation is usu- 
ally only applied to permanent plantings of this 
kind, to vegetable or truck crops, and to sugar cane. 
When water is very scarce and expensive, it is some- 
times brought to the ends of the rows in wooden 
troughs with holes and plugs so arranged that it can 
be run directly into the furrows as needed. This 
obviates the loss by seepage in the ditches, but it is, 
of course, more expensive. In the tobacco fields in 
some parts of Cuba water is pumped from deep wells 
and is carried to different parts of the field in iron 
pipes, being then distributed to the plants in buckets 
by hand. This method is not only expensive but 
inefficient.
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
All of the above are forms of what is called sur- 
face irrigation. They are all open to the objection 
that they pack the surface of the soil, leaving it 
hard and in a condition to bake badly unless each 
irrigation is followed by tillage. Excepting where 
the land is very nearly level there will also be loss 
from surface washing. These troubles can be obviated 
and better results can be obtained by what is known as 
subirrigation. In this system the water is distrib- 
uted under the surface by means of porous pipes. It 
permeates the subsoil and keeps it moist without in- 
terfering with the condition of tilth of the surface. 
Lines of draintile are sometimes so arranged that 
by closing the outlets and flooding them they can 
serve for subirrigation during dry weather, and by 
opening them again their action as underdrains can be 
restored in case of heavy rains. Subirrigation gives 
very fine results in greenhouses and on ornamental 
grounds where there is no objection to expense, but 
it is too costly for ordinary farm operations, and we 
must rely on frequent tillage to obviate the bad 
effects of surface applications of water. With all 
crops that permit it tillage should invariably follow 
an irrigation as soon as the land becomes dry enough. 
This prevents baking and the formation of a hard 
crust; it aérates the soil and, by the formation of a 
dust mulch, preserves the moisture and renders future 
irrigations necessary at much less frequent intervals. 
The greatest temptation to the irrigation farmer is 
to rely too much on water and too little on tillage. 
The overabundant use of water should always be 
avoided, especially in arid regions. Where there is 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 55 
little rainfall to wash out soluble salts, they gradually 
accumulate, especially in those places where water 
stands and evaporates so that a thick alkaline in- 
crustation is often formed on the surface. The 
alternate soaking and surface drying of the soil 
tends to pump up the soluble salts from the subsoil 
and concentrate them near the surface. Even where 
the water used is in itself free from alkali, continued 
careless irrigation will, in many parts of the West, so 
bring the salts to the surface as to prevent the pro- 
duction of crops. Thousands of acres of valuable 
lands have already been ruined in this way. An 
absolute remedy for this trouble is, however, to be 
found in proper drainage. A system of under- 
drainage, which will carry off the surplus water from 
below instead of allowing it to evaporate from the 
surface, will not only prevent the undue accumula- 
tion of salts in the upper layers, but it will serve to 
redeem lands that are naturally too alkaline for cul- 
tivation by washing down the alkali and carrying it 
off in the drainage water. There are immense areas 
of land in the West that are now absolutely worthless 
on account of an excess of alkali that could be re- 
deemed and made extremely fertile by a combination 
of irrigation and underdrainage. Even without un- 
derdrainage the digging of deep surface drains at 
such places as will serve to quickly carry off the 
surplus irrigation water from the bottom of the fields 
instead of allowing it to stand and evaporate in the 
low places will do much to obviate what is really a 
very grave danger for the irrigation farmer in many 
parts of the arid regions. In fact irrigation should  
-P-A-G-E-70
56 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
never be employed in any country without making 
full provision in some way for the carrying off of the 
surplus water. 
Improving the Soil Chemically. —In the previous 
paragraphs various means have been discussed for 
improving the physical condition of the soil. It 
now remains to consider how its chemical condition 
may be improved. 
Liming. — When soils are lacking in lime, the 
transformation of vegetable matter does not proceed 
properly and an acid condition of the soil is induced 
that is very detrimental to certain crops, especially 
to clover and many other of the legumes. Corn and 
potatoes, on the other hand, do not mind a slightly 
acid soil. In fact it is an advantage for the latter 
crop, since it partially prevents the growth of the 
scab fungus, and the potatoes are smoother. Whether 
or nota given soil will be benefited by the application 
of lime can usually be easily determined by mixing 
a little of it to a thin paste with water and inserting 
bits of blue litmus paper. If after standing a few 
minutes the paper turns red or reddish, an acid con- 
dition and the need of lime is indicated. Asa rule, 
sandy lands are more likely to be deficient in lime 
than clays. In the case of very stiff, refractory clays, 
however, applications of lime are sometimes useful, 
even if there is no acid reaction, since the lime tends 
to make them more friable and to render the mineral 
food elements more soluble and available. Recently 
drained muck and swamp lands too are usually sour 
and are much benefited by lime. On sandy lands, 
where a large amount of vegetation is plowed under as
-P-A-G-E-71
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 57 
a green manure, it is often best to apply lime to avoid 
inducing an acid condition. On the other hand, the 
overapplication of lime is sometimes very injurious. 
As is said, it burns the life out of the soil by render- 
ing the elements of fertility too quickly and com- 
pletely soluble, so that they are leached out and lost. 
Some soils, too, it renders more liable to crust and bake 
after rains. Lime should never be applied unless there 
is clear evidence that it is needed, and good judgment 
will be required to determine how much to use, since 
this will depend entirely on the actual condition of 
the field to which it is to be applied. As a rule 
when lime is needed, it is best to make one pretty 
thorough application and then add no more for four 
or five years rather than to add small dressings annu- 
ally. It is best, too, to apply it as long as possible in 
advance of planting the crop so that it may have 
time to lose some of its caustic action and become 
more thoroughly incorporated with the soil. Lime 
is usually applied in the form of the hydroxide; that 
is to say, as slacked lime. This is the best form in 
which to use it where it is desired to quickly correct 
acidity or for the mellowing of intractable clays. 
For the permanent improvement of sandy lands, how- 
ever, especially if used in large quantities, the car- 
bonate in the form of finely ground limestone or shells 
is safer and will give much more permanent results. 
Lime, in the form of the sulphate or land plaster, is 
often applied with good results, especially on clover. 
It should always be remembered, however, that lime 
applied in any form acts as an alterative or stimulant 
and not as a true food, and that unless active measures

  58 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
are taken at the same time for increasing the food 
supply its use will tend to give temporarily increased 
crops at the expense of permanent fertility. In other 
words, as has been so forcibly said, if used alone, it 
tends to enrich the fathers, but to impoverish the sons. 
Manuring. — This general term is applied to all 
those processes by which plant food is added to the 
soil for the purpose of maintaining or increasing its 
fertility. Some soils are naturally so deep and fer- 
tile that they may be cultivated continuously for 
many years without diminished productiveness, but 
even the richest will in time show signs of exhaustion 
if no plant food is returned to them. The problem 
of manuring is, therefore, one of the most important 
that can engage the attention of the farmer. The 
only exception to this statement is to be found in 
those few favored localities, like the Nile Valley, 
where the overflow from some great river brings 
down annually rich deposits from the washings of the 
lands near its source. 
Stable Manure. — This is one of the most widely 
used and important substances for enriching the soil. 
It consists of the solid and liquid excrement of 
domestic animals mixed with more or less straw or 
other litter that has been used as bedding in the 
stables. It is more widely useful than any other 
fertilizing material and can be used to advantage on 
nearly all crops. It not only supplies all three of the 
useful chemical elements,— nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and potash in some quantity, — but it adds a large 
amount of easily fermentable organic matter to the 
soil and thus improves its mechanical condition. If
-P-A-G-E-73
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 59 
an abundant supply could always be had at a reason- 
able cost, there would be comparatively little need for 
other fertilizers. It is only on those farms, however, 
where the feeding of live stock is the principal indus- 
try that it can be produced in sufficient quantity to 
fully supply the need for maintaining fertility. A 
considerable amount can, of course, be obtained in 
towns and cities, but the expense of transporting it 
back to the farms becomes a considerable item, and 
the same amount of benefit can often be obtained 
more cheaply by other means. In every case, how- 
ever, all the stable manure produced on the farm, be it 
much or little, should be carefully saved and utilized. 
On only too many farms, especially in new countries, 
this important matter is grossly neglected, and the 
manure is either wasted entirely or it is handled so 
carelessly that half of its value is lost. If not carried 
at once to the field when taken from the stable, it 
should be piled under some rough shed, where it 
will be at least partially protected from the rain. If 
it is where it will be tramped and compacted by cattle, 
or worked over by hogs, so much the better. If large 
quantities are thrown out-at once, it should be thor- 
oughly wet down to avoid a kind of mold known as fire- 
fanging. Thin layers of earth spread over the grow- 
ing pile from time to time are also useful for absorbing 
the ammonia that escapes as fermentation progresses. 
Some farmers construct expensive cemented ditches 
or cellars in which to store manure, but this is not 
necessary. All that is needed is that it be sheltered 
from washing rains, and that care be taken to keep 
the piles compact and moist enough to prevent fire-
-P-A-G-E-74
    60 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
fanging. Such manure piles should be forked over at 
intervals in order to quickly get them into the best 
condition. 
On grass lands, and sometimes to form a mulch 
about orchard trees, manure is applied as a top dress- 
ing. This, however, is rather wasteful, as part of the 
ammonia is likely to be dissipated in the atmosphere 
and a considerable value is likely to be lost by wash- 
ing rains. Where possible, it ismuch better to plow 
it into the land. If the manure has been piled so 
that it is well rotted, this may be done at any time; 
preferably just in advance of planting the seed. 
Large quantities of unrotted manure, however, 
plowed into the land at this time are likely to do harm 
by rendering the soil too open and causing the crop to 
suffer from drought, unless rains are very abundant. 
When fresh manure from the stables can be plowed 
into the ground long enough in advance of planting, 
so that it has time to become partially decomposed, 
and the soil has been settled by a few heavy rains, the 
results are eminently satisfactory. In fact, when 
possible, this is the best way to utilize stable manure, 
since there is no loss in fermentation and no extra ex- 
pense in rehandling. Instead of taking the manure 
from the stables daily, if box stalls can be provided 
for the animals and there is plenty of material for 
bedding, it may be allowed to accumulate in the stalls 
until such time as a field is ready for plowing, when 
it can be hauled direct to the field. The tramping 
of the animals in the stalls keeps it compacted and in 
good condition for a long period. Theoretically this 
method is more or less objectionable as being unhy-

IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 61 
gienic for the animals, and it certainly could not be 
recommended for dairy cattle ; but for fattening cattle 
and horses it has many practical advantages, provided 
always that the stables are dry and that enough bed- 
ding and other absorbents are used to keep them 
from becoming offensive. 
Green Manures. — Since on most farms the supply 
of stable manure is entirely insufficient to replace the 
organic matter that is annually oxydized and de- 
stroyed in the soil through the influence of tillage, it 
becomes of the utmost importance to find some other 
means of supplying this deficiency. The important 
role played by decaying organic matter in the soil has 
already been touched upon, and it has been stated 
that its fertility can in many cases be gauged by the 
amount of organic matter which it contains. The 
problem should be constantly in the mind of every 
farmer as to how he can best keep his lands supplied 
with this ever-needed ingredient. In Southern coun- 
tries, as has also been pointed out, this need is even 
greater than at the North, since here those fermenta- 
tive changes by which the organic matter is oxydized 
and destroyed are going on uninterruptedly throughout 
the year. The easiest and cheapest way in which to 
supply this much-needed organic material is obviously 
to plow in and incorporate with the soil some part at 
least of the vegetation that is annually produced on 
it. This process is called green manuring, meaning 
the manuring with green plants. Its importance in 
farm economy cannot be overestimated. Fortunately 
at the South, where it is most needed, it is most feasi- 
ble and practical, for the long growing season gives  
-P-A-G-E-76
  62 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
time for growing one or more crops for sale and at 
least one crop every year for enriching the soil. 
Any kind of fermentable vegetable matter is useful 
when incorporated in the soil. The stalks, straw, or 
other unused portions of all crops should be left in 
the field to be plowed under. Even unsightly weeds 
will have their usefulness if plowed into the land. 
Grasses of all kinds are also useful. The richness of 
well-rotted ‘sod land is proverbial. Crops of the 
small grains like rye or oats or of fodder corn plowed 
into the land are also helpful. In the Southern states 
cotton and corn land should when possible be seeded 
down to winter oats or rye in the fall, since these 
crops prevent washing during the heavy winter rains 
and when plowed down in the spring add consider- 
ably to the fertility of the soil. All such green crops 
are beneficial, however, only for the organic matter 
which they contain and their consequent effect on the 
mechanical and biological condition of the soil. They 
add no important chemical elements, since all the ni- 
trogen, phosphoric acid, and potash they contain was 
taken directly from the soil, and they, therefore, only 
return what they have already taken. The marvelous 
power has already been mentioned possessed by plants 
belonging to the Leguminose, of seizing and fixing 
the atmospheric nitrogen through the agency of the 
tubercle-forming bacteria that dwell in their roots. 
This overshadowingly important fact indicates clearly 
that some leguminous crop should if possible always 
be chosen for green manuring. A well-grown crop of 
clover, cowpeas, velvet beans, or beggar weed, turned 
into the soil, adds as much nitrogen as would be con-
-P-A-G-E-77
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 63 
tained in a heavy application of stable manure, and 
its effect on the improvement of the soil is fully as 
great. In planting one of these crops for soil im- 
provement we can well say that we are growing a crop 
of stable manure, since its effect on the soil is almost 
identical. In one important respect it is, in fact, 
markedly superior. In only too many cases stable 
manure is the means of introducing the seeds of many 
noxious weeds and grasses. Crops of these legumes, 
however, occupy the land so closely that they smother 
and kill the weeds and are thus a considerable factor 
in subduing and eradicating them. 
At the North red clover (Trifolium pratense) is 
the legume almost universally depended on for soil- 
improving purposes. It is also an exceedingly valu- 
able forage and occupies a prominent place in the 
crop rotation adopted by all good farmers. It usually 
occupies the land for at least two years. Unfortu- 
nately it does not succeed well at the South and need 
not be considered in the region for which this work 
is especially written. 
Crimson clover ( Trifolium incarnatum) is an annual 
plant and, therefore, must be resown every year. It 
grows best during the cooler part of the year. It is 
well adapted to many of the soils of the Southern 
states, and where it can be made to succeed it isa 
very useful winter cover crop, especially for orchards 
and for cotton lands. The young plants are quite 
delicate and the land must be put in a condition of 
perfect tilth before the planting, in order to obtain a 
stand. It can be planted from August to October. 
It makes fine hay if cut when in bloom, and the crop 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
can be harvested in time to put in a late crop of 
cotton. The roots and stubble alone will add 
much to the fertility of the soil, but, of course, its 
full benefit as a manure is 
only obtained when the en- 
tire crop is plowed under. 
As the clovers are not gener- 
ally grown at the South most 
Southern soils do not contain 
the kind of bacteria that form 
tubercles on clover roots. To 
succeed with this crop, there- 
fore, it is necessary in most 
instances to resort to what is 
known as soil inoculation, in 
order to provide these bac- 
" teria artificially. Two meth- 
ods of soil inoculation are 
more or less in practical use. 
The first consists in taking a 
quantity of soil from a field 
where clover of some kind 
has already been grown suc- 
cessfully and sowing it with 
the seed. As much as a ton 
of soil per acre should be used 
to be sure of securing the 
desired result. In the second 
method the seeds are wet with 
a nutritive solution to which 
a pure culture of the desired 
bacterium has been added some hours previously. 
  Crimson Cloyer. 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 65 
The infected seed is planted and quickly covered 
while still moist. Various methods have been devised 
for safely transporting and distributing pure cultures 
of these useful organisms, but none of them have as 
yet proved fully satisfactory in practice. The one 
adopted by the United States Department of Agri- 
culture and most in use at the present time consists 
in saturating portions of absorbent cotton with fresh 
cultures of the bacteria and then quickly drying 
them. If the dried cotton is now securely wrapped 
to prevent it from again absorbing moisture, the 
culture will retain its vitality for a considerable 
period of time, and the packets of dried cultures may 
be safely shipped through the mails. If, however, 
the culture is exposed to alternate moisture and 
dryness, it soon dies. For use the bits of cotton 
with the dried culture are dropped into a bucket of 
water containing a prescribed portion of nutrient 
salts. In a few hours the liquid becomes turbid 
from the growth of the organisms, and it is now 
ready for moistening the seed. These dried cultures 
can be obtained commercially from most of the 
larger seedsmen, and while their use is often attended 
with failure, it is well worth making repeated efforts 
to get this and the next-mentioned crop established 
in new localities. The effect of a successful inocula- 
tion is sometimes little short of miraculous, the 
plants growing with the greatest vigor and producing 
a crop at the rate of one and a half or two tons of 
hay per acre, while on adjoining uninoculated plots 
the plants soon turn yellow and stop growing when 
only a few inches high. Such an experiment has to 
F
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
be seen to be either believed or appreciated. Of 
course no such striking result follows inoculation on 
soils where clover of any kind has been already 
grown and where the soil is consequently supplied 
with the clover organism. Crimson clover will not 
be likely to succeed in any part of the tropics. 
  Hairy Vetch. 
The hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) is another winter- 
growing legume that is of great importance for the 
Southern states, and it deserves to be much more 
widely cultivated. It should be planted in the late 
summer or fall, like the crimson clover, but as the seeds 
are large and the young plants much more vigorous 
it does not require such careful preparation of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 67 
soil. It produces an even better forage than crimson 
clover and as a soil-improving plant it is unexcelled. 
The only objection to it is the rather high cost of 
seed. When once established on the land it, how- 
ever, reseeds itself freely. The seeds lie dormant dur- 
ing the summer, but germinate on the approach of cool 
weather in the fall. Asa cover crop for orchards it is 
exceedingly valuable, since it covers the ground and 
prevents washing during the winter and furnishes 
much valuable fertilizing material, while at the same 
time allowing of free cultivation during the summer. 
It can also be utilized in corn and cotton fields, but 
it is necessary that these crops be planted a little late 
in order to allow for the ripening of the vetch seed in 
the spring. Soil inoculation is usually necessary with 
vetch, since most Southern soils do not contain its 
specific organism. Unfortunately the tubercle bac- 
teria of vetch and clover are not identical, and the 
fact that the soil is inoculated for the one will not 
help it to grow the other. The pods of vetch are often 
freely attacked by the cotton-boll worm and this has 
prevented the profitable production of vetch seed in 
the Southern states. It will be seen that crimson 
clover and vetch fill much the same part in the farm 
economy, each being winter-growing legumes of about 
equal value as cover crops, as forage, and for green 
manuring. The vetch, however, will thrive under 
a wider range of soil conditions and has the great ad- 
vantage of reseeding the land. There is no more 
rapid and effective method of improving exhausted 
Southern lands than by planting vetch in the fall 
and following this with corn and cowpeas in the
-P-A-G-E-82
68 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
summer. The corn crop, together with the pasturage 
afforded by the peas in the fall and the vetch in 
early spring, will more than repay the phosphate and 
labor required. A very few years of this treatment 
will restore the poorest, most exhausted fields and 
make them as productive as the best virgin lands. 
The spring vetch (Vicia sativa) grows in much the 
same way as the hairy vetch. It, too, is a useful plant, 
but it does not make as heavy a mass of vegetation as 
the other. The vetches are not well adapted to the 
tropics. 
The cowpea ( Vigna Catjang?) is, without doubt, the 
one most important legume for Southern agricul- 
ture. It has often been called the clover of the South, 
since it plays the same leading réle here that red 
clover does at the North. It is a rank-growing an- 
nual, completing its growth in about three months. 
Being of tropical origin, it delights in hot weather 
and does not succeed well during the cooler months. 
Its short growing season makes it possible to grow 
it as a manurial crop at times when the land would 
otherwise be unoccupied, as, for instance, after a crop 
of winter oats or rye or after an early spring crop 
of vegetables. It is most widely used, however, to 
plant between the rows of corn at the time of 
the last cultivation when the crop is being laid by. 
It can in like manner be very profitably used on 
cane plantations to sow between the cane as a cover 
crop at the beginning of the rainy season.’ The peas 
1 Wight (U.S. Dept. of Agric., Bureau of Plant Industry, Bull. 
102) shows that most of the varieties of cowpeas should be re- 
ferred to Vigna unguiculata rather than to V. Catjung.
-P-A-G-E-83
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 
  69 
     ‘The Cowpea,
-P-A-G-E-84
  70 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
can be sown broadcast, using from three pecks to 
three bushels of seed per acre. It is more usual, 
however, to plant in drills about three feet apart. 
This only requires about half as much seed and al- 
lows of giving one or two cultivations. If supplied 
with potash and phosphoric acid, they will make a 
rank growth even on very poor lands. The use of a 
fertilizer that supplies these elements is often re- 
quired to secure the best results. They are very 
efficient as nitrogen gatherers and thus serve to build 
up and enrich the soil very rapidly. Practically all 
soils at the South and in the adjacent tropics are 
plentifully supplied with the appropriate tubercle- 
forming bacteria for this plant, so that soil inocula- 
tion isseldom necessary. There are many varieties 
of cowpeas. These differ not only in the color and 
size of the seed, but in time of maturity and habit of 
growth. The whippoorwill, or speckled pea, matures 
very early and has an erect, almost bushlike habit 
of growth. It yields a large amount of seed, but 
produces less leaves and vines than some of the 
others. It can be planted farther north than the 
other kinds, maturing well in Kansas, central Illinois, 
and Delaware. It is also particularly useful when 
the land can only be occupied for a short time, and 
from its erect habit of growth it is easily cut and 
handled in making hay. The iron pea, unlike the 
whippoorwill, produces a large amount of vines and 
leaves, but usually ripens a less amount of seed. It 
remains green longer than any of the others and is 
thought to be more resistant to certain diseases. At 
the South, where the season is long, it is one of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 71 
best kinds to plant for soil-improving purposes. It 
is particularly adapted to conditions in Cuba. The 
wonderful pea combines to some extent the quali- 
ties of the other two, producing more vines than the 
whippoorwill and more seed than the iron. It isa 
good general-purpose pea over a wide territory. 
Cowpeas will thrive on a great variety of soils, but 
do best on well-drained clays or sandy loams. They 
are easily injured by standing water and do not, as 
a rule, do well on very light shifting sands. On these 
lighter soils especially they are subject to two rather 
serious diseases. They are attacked by “wilt” 
(Neocosmospora), a fungous disease that enters the 
plant through the roots, and are also subject to the 
nematode root knot (Heterodera), which is so com- 
mon a pest in sandy Southern soil. No remedy 
for these troubles is known, and it becomes necessary 
to abandon the planting of peas on lands badly in- 
fested by them. The iron pea, it is claimed, is par- 
tially immune to both of these troubles. 
It is sometimes a question how best to utilize a crop 
of peas. If cut as the first pods are maturing and 
properly cured, they make a hay fully equal to the 
best clover hay. As with clover most of the curing 
should be done in the windrow and shock. The leaves 
will fall badly if the hay is allowed to lie too long fully 
exposed to the sun. Where enough stock is kept to 
eat the hay, this is undoubtedly the best use to which 
the cowpea crop can be put, since nearly all of its 
manurial value is recovered in the droppings, and its 
very considerable food value is also utilized. Even 
when the hay is cut and sold, repeated careful experi-
-P-A-G-E-86
72 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
ments demonstrate that enough nitrogen remains in 
the roots, stubble, and fallen leaves to very materially 
increase the following crop, whatever it may be, that 
occupies the field. If the hay cannot be profitably 
utilized, it may be possible to allow the crop to 
ripen, gather the pods, and then plow under the vines. 
This plan is often followed. The peas and pods 
make excellent feed for horses, mules, or hogs, and the 
shelled peas have a considerable commercial value as 
human food and for seed. The unripe pods, too, may 
be picked and eaten like string beans. Farmers 
sometimes save the expense of gathering the crop 
by turning in the hogs as the peas begin to ripen. 
Nowhere will hogs makea more thrifty, rapid growth 
than when having the range of a pea field. Even if 
it is impossible to utilize the crop in any of the 
above ways, the Southern farmer should always plan 
to plant every acre of his land, that it is possible, in 
cowpeas every year, for in no other way can he build 
up its fertility so cheaply and so rapidly. It has 
been said that a man is a benefactor who causes two 
blades of grass to grow instead of one. If this say- 
ing had referred to cowpeas instead, it would have 
carried a much greater truth. | 
Velvet Bean (Mucuna utilis).— This is another 
rank-growing, tropical, annual, leguminous vine thatis 
exceedingly useful as a soil-improving and cover crop 
in the far South and in the tropics. It requires 
rather a long season of warm weather and does not 
succeed well much north of central Alabama and 
Mississippi. It will flourish on any well-drained 
soil, even growing on the lightest sands if they con-

tain a sufficient amount of phosphoric acid and potash. 
What first brought it into prominence was the fact 
that it grew so vigorously on the light, sandy soils 
of Florida, where the cowpea failed on account of 
the attacks of nematodes. The velvet bean is per-

fectly immune to this pest. It has been widely used 
in Florida as a cover crop in orange orchards during 
the summer rainy season, the usual practice there 
being to cultivate during the dry season of winter 
and shade the ground with some green crop dur- 
ing the summer. The velvet bean seems admirably
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
adapted for this purpose, accumulating vast quantities 
of nitrogen and leaves an immense deposit of vegetable 
matter. It is necessary, however, to constantly keep 
it cut away from the trees or it would soon climb up 
and smother them. The climbing power of this vine 
  Velvet Bean, fruits. 
is something remarkable. An instance is known to 
the writer where beans planted at the foot of a fifty- 
foot windmill tower climbed to the top by fall and 
had to be cut down to prevent clogging the wheel. 
The velvet bean does not produce flowers and fruit 
until very late in the fall. In Florida a large crop 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 75 
of seed is secured, but they cannot be depended upon 
to ripen seed much farther north. 
For the latitude where it succeeds the velvet bean 
must be considered as a formidable competitor with 
the cowpea for first place as a soil-improving crop. 
It cannot, however, be used interculturally among 
other crops as can the cowpeas, but must occupy the 
ground alone. When land can be given up to a soil- 
improving crop for from four to five months during 
the summer, no other crop will produce such sat- 
isfactory results in the way of securing nitrogen, 
smothering foul weeds, and adding humus to the soil. 
It this adapts itself perfectly to the needs of winter 
truck growers in southern Florida and the tropics and 
to use in Cuban tobacco fields, since in Cuba tobacco 
is strictly a winter crop and the land, as a rule, lies 
idle during the summer. 
It is also an invaluable plant in preparing the land 
for permanent crops like orchards or sugar cane. 
What clover is to agriculture of the North and the 
cowpea is to the cotton belt, the velvet bean is des- 
tined to be for the tropics, where the need for a 
much greater use of soil-improving plants is so 
imperative. 
Like the cowpea, velvet beans may be sown 
broadcast or planted in drills; in nearly all cases the 
latter is preferable since one or two cultivations give 
them a chance to get ahead of weeds and grass. 
When they once begin to run, no further attention 
is needed, since they quickly climb up and by their 
weight bend over and drag down any chance weed 
that happens to spring up among them. They will

  76 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
cover and completely bury, and in this way almost 
exterminate, that most dreaded of Southern weeds — 
Johnson grass. 
When green, velvet bean vines are not at first 
particularly relished by stock, but a taste is soon 
acquired for them; the partially ripened pods in the 
fall, however, furnish very rich pasturage. The 
vines, if cut and cured into hay, are eaten readily and 
are very nutritious, but they are so long and tangled 
that they are difficult to cut and handle. 
It is often found quite difficult to properly plow 
under and incorporate with the soil the dense mass 
of vegetation produced by a crop of velvet beans. 
By first passing a roller over the field, or a log. 
drag, to flatten them down, a sharp disk plow will 
bury them very satisfactorily, and the vines rot 
quickly in the ground and in the course of a month 
will have so far disappeared as not to interfere with 
cultivation. On heavy lands the best results will be 
secured by cross plowing after three or four weeks. 
On lighter soils this second plowing will not be 
needed, and the land can be put in perfect tilth by 
the use of a disk harrow. There is considerable 
prejudice on the part of some against incorporating 
so large a mass of green vegetation with a light, 
sandy soil for fear of creating an acid condition ; 
this danger is in most cases more fancied than real, 
though many people on sandy land prefer to allow 
the vines to die and dry out on the surface before 
plowing them under; this will always be the better 
plan when the land is not going to be immediately 
utilized for planting some crop.

it reseeds itself and comes up at the beginning of the 
summer rains, even when the land has been thoroughly 
cultivated during the winter and spring. It could 
also doubtless be utilized as a cover crop in cane 
fields. Beggar weed thrives on the thinnest, sandiest 
soils as well as on those of better quality. It is an

  78 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
efficient nitrogen gatherer, furnishes much nutritious 
pasturage, and if planted thick and cut young, it 
makes good hay. The stems, however, get hard and 
woody with age. It should always be used in 
orchards on soils where cowpeas do not thrive, and 
for orchard purposes it has the considerable advantage 
of reseeding itself. It is sown broadcast, using about 
eight quarts per acre. It thrives well in the tropics, 
where it is an indigenous weed. 
Other Legumes for Green Manuring.— There are 
many other leguminous plants that are sometimes used 
for green manuring. Of these Japan clover, bur 
clover, alfalfa, and the peanut will be discussed under 
forage plants. On the rotten limestone prairies 
of Alabama and Mississippi sweet clover (Melilotus 
alba) has proved to be the most useful of all legumes. 
Its long taproots penetrate the hard subsoil, thus 
making it permeable and greatly improving its me- 
chanical condition, in addition to adding to its store 
of nitrogen. At the North this plant is con- 
sidered a pestiferous weed. In some of the West 
India islands indigo (Indigofera anil) has been 
more or less used as a green manure. Leguminous 
trees of various kinds are usually chosen by coffee 
and cacao planters to use as shade trees among their 
crops. The trees as well as the herbaceous plants be- 
longing to the Leguminose produce root tubercles, 
and they thus add nitrogen to the soil at the same time 
that they shade the trees. This family is very 
largely represented in the natural flora of all tropical 
countries, the number of species found far exceeding 
those of temperate latitudes. Very many of them 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 79 
possess habits of growth in a wild state that make 
a careful study of their cultural characteristics and 
possibilities exceedingly desirable. It is altogether 
probable that in the future many more of them 
will be utilized for soil-improving purposes than 
at present. As has already been pointed out, the 
subject of green manuring is of great importance in 
the tropics where the stock of vegetable matter in 
the soil is so quickly destroyed, but it is here that 
the subject has attracted least attention and its pos- 
sibilities for good are only beginning to be realized. 
Commercial Fertilizers. — While the subject of green 
manuring with leguminous crops is of the utmost 
importance to Southern agriculture, and while it is 
possible by this means alone to keep the soil in good 
mechanical condition, and to supply it with a large 
amount of nitrogen, it does not add to the total 
quantity of potassium and phosphoric acid, those other 
equally important food elements. With even the 
richest soils these will at length become exhausted, 
and it will be necessary to supply them in the form 
of commercial or, as they are often called, chemical 
fertilizers. Immense quantities of these fertilizers 
are sold annually in the South, and in only too many 
cases farmers have come to depend on them exclu- 
sively as the means of increasing their crops. This 
is extremely unwise. In the first place, it is poor 
economy. It is always unwise to buy that which 
can be produced cheaper at home. In the second 
place, soils manured year after year with only com- 
mercial fertilizers soon lose their vegetable matter, 
become difficult to work, and suffer excessively 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
from drought. Commercial fertilizers are really 
indispensable in modern agriculture and when used 
appropriately they are very profitable, but as a gen- 
eral rule they should only be used to supplement, 
not to replace, stable and green manures. It should 
never be forgotten that vegetable matter is always 
necessary in order to maintain the soil in a good 
mechanical condition and that this is fully as impor- 
tant as chemical composition in the production of 
crops. 
Commercial fertilizers are valuable, generally 
speaking, only for the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, 
and potash which they contain. If a fertilizer con- 
tains all three of these substances, it is said to be 
a complete fertilizer. If one or more of them is 
lacking, it is called an incomplete fertilizer. Most 
farmers make the mistake of valuing fertilizers 
according to the price per ton. This is very mis- 
leading, and means nothing, unless the price per ° 
ton is considered with reference to composition; 
that is, to the number of pounds of each of these 
substances that the ton of fertilizer contains. Of 
these substances nitrogen is much the most expen- 
sive. It usually costs about three times as much 
per pound as either of the other two. In different 
localities, and in different years, the nitrogen in 
fertilizers usually costs from 14 cents to 18 cents 
per pound, while the potash and soluble phos- 
phoric acid cost from 3 to 6 cents per pound each. 
If a fertilizer contains 4 per cent of nitrogen, 8 per 
cent of phosphoric acid, and 5 per cent of potash, 
each ton will contain 80 pounds of nitrogen, 160 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 81 
pounds of phosphoric acid, and 100 pounds of potash. 
If we assume a value of 15 cents per pound for the 
nitrogen, and 5 cents for each of the other ingre- 
dients, we will have a value as follows : — 
  80 pounds of nitrogen at 15 cents = $12 
160 pounds of soluble phosphoric acid at 5 cents = 8 
100 pounds of potash at 5 cents =o 
Total value per ton = $25 
It will readily be seen that such a fertilizer would 
really be cheaper at $25 than one with 3 per cent of 
nitrogen, 6 per cent of phosphoric acid, and 4 per 
cent of potash would be at $20, for the real value 
of the latter would only figure out $19. It is usu- 
ally a mistake to buy cheap, low-grade fertilizers, 
for even if bought at their real value, there is a 
larger proportion of inert matter or “filler” on 
which to pay freight and to handle in the field. 
The valuable ingredients of fertilizers are ob- 
tained from many different sources. The nitrogen 
may be of either animal, vegetable, or mineral origin. 
Nitrate of soda, or, as it is sometimes called, Chile 
saltpeter, is found in large deposits in some of the 
drier parts of South America. It is used as a fer- 
tilizer in great quantities, either alone or combined 
with other substances. Being very soluble, and in 
a form to be immediately taken up and utilized by 
the plant, it acts very quickly, giving almost im- 
mediate results, the leaves taking on a darker color, 
and the plant showing increased vigor of growth 
within a very few days after its application. On 
account of its solubility, however, it is easily washed 
and leached away by the rain, and as it is expensive 
G

  82 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
| 
it should only be applied in small doses, and just at 
the time when it will be most useful in the growth 
of the plant. It is much used by market gardeners, 
and sometimes as a top dressing for lawns and small 
grains. Sulphate of ammonia is another mineral 
source of nitrogen for fertilizers. It is a by-product 
of certain manufacturers. It, too, is very soluble, 
but it acts more slowly than nitrate of soda, since, 
before becoming available, it must be acted on by 
the soil bacteria, and be converted into the form 
of a nitrate. It is a valuable source of nitrogen, 
especially for heavy clay soils. If used in large 
quantities on sandy lands that are deficient in lime, 
an acid condition may ultimately be induced that 
will be harmful. Dried blood, tankage, and other 
slaughterhouse refuse, and fish scrap, the waste 
-material from the manufacture of fish oil, are the 
usual animal sources of nitrogen. ‘They are all 
extensively used, and give excellent results with 
most crops. All have to undergo fermentation and 
nitrification in the soil before becoming available. 
Dried blood undergoes the changes very quickly, 
but the tankage acts more slowly. ‘This is some- 
times an advantage for crops that need to be nour- 
ished during a long growing season. Guano, the 
dried excrement of sea birds found in certain desert 
islands off the Pacific coast of South America, should 
also be mentioned in this connection. It has been 
much used as a fertilizer and contains considerable 
nitrogen. The bat guano, found so abundantly in 
caves in many regions, has usually been subject to 
leaching by water, and so has lost most of its nitro-
-P-A-G-E-97
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 83 
gen. Occasional deposits are found, however, that 
are rich in this element. Stable manures, night 
soils, and other animal excrements, owe their value 
as fertilizers largely to the nitrogen which they 
contain. Vegetable substances, useful as fertilizers 
on account of the nitrogen they contain, are the 
residues left from the extraction of various vegetable 
oils. Cuastor-bean pumice and cotton-seed meal are 
the two most widely used for this purpose. For 
many years cotton seed and cotton-seed meal were 
the cheapest sources of nitrogen in the South, but 
now they are so extensively used for feeding cattle 
that the price rules higher. The immense impor- 
tance as a fertilizer of the vegetable nitrogen con- 
tained in leguminous plants has already been suffi- 
ciently emphasized. 
Phosphoric acid as found in fertilizers is always 
combined with lime. It is mostly derived from 
bones and from certain phosphatic rocks that are 
mined very extensively in South Carolina and 
Florida. It occurs in three conditions, known com- 
mercially as water soluble, citrate soluble, and in- 
soluble phosphate. The first two are both supposed. 
to be immediately available as plant food, and both 
are rated at about the same value. The extent to 
which the so-called insoluble phosphate becomes dis- 
solved in the soil and thus becomes available de- 
pends on the fineness to which it is ground and the 
amount of vegetable matter in the soil. The 
chemical changes taking place in connection with 
the fermentation of vegetable matter aid consider- 
ably in its solution. The insoluble phosphate from
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
bones, too, becomes available more easily than that 
from rock phosphates. Sometimes the bone meal is 
treated with sulphuric acid to make it all soluble. 
It is then called dissolved bone. The rock phos- 
phates are nearly always treated with sulphuric acid 
before being used. They are then known as acid 
phosphates or superphosphates. Bird and_ bat 
guanos all contain considerable quantities of phos- 
phoric acid. The bat guanos in particular usu- 
ally owe most of their value to this substance. 
Thomas slag, a by-product of certain iron furnaces, 
is considerably used in England and Europe as a 
source of phosphoric acid. Hard-wood ashes also 
contain a considerable percentage. 
Potash for fertilizing purposes also comes from 
hard-wood ashes, but it is usually derived from cer- 
tain potash salts that are extensively mined in 
Germany. Kainit, one of these salts in its crude 
state, is very largely used in the manufacture of low- 
grade fertilizers. It contains considerable quantities 
of common salt and other impurities and so is ob- 
jectionable for tobacco and some other crops. The 
muriate of potash prepared from these crude salts is 
usually the cheapest form in which to apply potash, 
especially at interior points where high freight rates 
increase the comparative cost of the crude salts. It 
is useful for corn, cotton, potatoes, and all ordinary 
crops; but it cannot be used for tobacco, since chlorine 
in any form ruins the burning quality of the leaf, 
and it is claimed by some investigators that it 
should not be used for sugar cane as it is thought to 
increase the per cent of glucose and other impurities.
-P-A-G-E-99
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 85 
There is also some prejudice against using it with 
fruits and vegetables. In the highest grades of 
fertilizers, therefore, the sulphate of potash is usually 
employed although it is slightly more expensive 
than the muriate. Some growers of cigar tobacco 
go even farther and only use the still more expen- 
sive carbonate. 
Commercial fertilizers are usually rather caustic, 
and if improperly used they may do much harm. 
Many kinds of seed will fail to germinate or the 
young plantlets will be killed if planted in direct 
contact with commercial fertilizers. Usually the 
best way to apply them is to open a furrow where 
the row is going to be, and scatter them in and 
cover from one to two weeks in advance of planting 
the seed. If more than four hundred or five 
hundred pounds per acre are used, the fertilizer 
should be mixed with the soil before covering by 
running a small shovel plow in the bottom of the 
furrow. If more than eight hundred or a thou- 
sand pounds per acre is used, only a part should be 
put in the furrow and the balance should be broad- 
casted and harrowed in. Where large quantities of 
very soluble fertilizers are used or where a crop 
has a very long growing season, it may be best to 
divide the amount and make two or three applica- 
tions at considerable intervals. In most cases, how- 
ever, this extra expense would not be justified and 
all should be applied in advance of planting. Some 
seeds like corn are quite resistant, and small quan- 
tities of fertilizer may be sown in the drill with the 
seed with safety. There are many seed drills in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  86 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
market with fertilizer attachments that can be used 
to plant and fertilize at the same operation. This 
is a considerable saving of labor. Various machines 
for drilling in fertilizers alone are also on the 
market. Where it is scattered by hand, a tin horn- 
shaped tube to deliver it in the bottom of the furrow 
is a great convenience, as it saves stooping and pre- 
vents it from being blown about by the wind and 
wasted. In fertilizing orchard trees it may be 
broadcasted about the tree and hoed or harrowed 
in, always taking care to scatter it evenly as far or a 
little farther than the branches extend; or if the 
trees are small, a furrow may be opened on each 
side of the row in which to scatter the fertilizer, 
which can then be covered with the plow. 
It is always a matter of great practical importance 
to determine what kind and what amount of fertili- 
zer to apply on any given soil and crop. Theoreti- 
cally a chemical analysis of the soil should show in 
what elements it was deficient, and thus enable one to 
judgein what proportions to blend the different plant 
foods and what quantities of them to apply. Prac- 
tically, however, this is seldoma safe guide. A chem- 
ical analysis may give some useful hints as to the 
probable needs of the soil, but the mechanical condi- 
tion and the available water supply have such a 
powerful effect on plant growth that nothing short 
of practical trials continued for a term of years can 
give any real knowledge as to the needs of a given 
soil. Every intelligent farmer must, to a considerable 
extent, be an experimenter. Experience thus gained 
in one locality can, however, be utilized in others
-P-A-G-E-101
  IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 87 
where the soil and climatic conditions are similar. 
Soil surveys, by means of which the different soil 
areas can be carefully mapped, are thus of great use 
in determining the proper use of fertilizers. The 
farmer can tell much, too, by closely observing his 
crops, as to their need for the different food elements. 
If the growth is slow and the leaves are small and 
yellow, it is an indication of the lack of nitrogen unless 
this condition has been caused by excessive drought. 
This element if present abundantly tends to induce a 
* rank growth and gives a dark green color to the leaves. 
If, on the other hand, the leaves are dark and the 
growth rank while but little fruit or grain is pro- 
duced, the lack of phosphoric acid is indicated. The 
phosphates promote fruitfulness and early maturity. 
Potash, on the other hand, tends to promote vigor 
and prolong the growing period. It is also supposed 
to give firmness and higher flavor to fruits, and in 
many cases it has a marked influence in promoting 
the health of plants and warding off disease. In a 
soil that is rich in nitrogen and phosphoric acid but 
deficient in potash the crop will start well early in 
the season, but it will be likely to show weakness 
later. The foliage is liable to become spotted and 
diseased, and the grain or fruit will be poor and 
light. Cases sometimes occur where soils are only 
deficient in some one or two of these elements, but 
in the great majority of cases all three will be found 
lacking, and a complete fertilizer will be required. 
Rotation of Crops. — The whole subject of soil 
improvement, especially improvement by the use 
of green manures, is intimately connected with a  
-P-A-G-E-102
  88 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
proper rotation of crops. It is, with few exceptions, 
extremely unwise to devote any given piece of land 
continuously to the same crop. Each crop draws 
on the food elements in the soil in different propor- 
tions, and where only one crop is planted the ten- 
dency is to exhaust the soil unequally. If this were 
the only difficulty, it would be easily overcome by 
the proper selection of fertilizers, but there are many 
others. Some crops, like cotton, require absolutely 
clean cultivation throughout the season. This, as 
has been previously pointed out, tends to the rapid 
exhaustion of vegetable matter. Other broadcast 
crops like the small grains cannot be cultivated at 
all, and if planted continuously the land becomes 
very foul with noxious weeds. Some crops occupy 
the land so continuously that they do not give time 
for the growing of leguminous catch crops for green 
manuring. The most imperative reason for crop 
rotation is, however, its usefulness in checking the 
rayages of diseases and insects. When the land is 
planted continuously to any given crop for a term of 
years, it makes ideally favorable conditions for the 
rapid multiplication of the diseases and insects pe- 
culiar to that crop. There are many instances in 
which, owing to continuous cropping, the land has 
become so infested with disease that the cultivation 
of the crop has had to be entirely abandoned. The 
bacterial blight of tomatoes and potatoes and the 
Fusarium wilt of watermelons and cotton may be 
mentioned as instances of Southern diseases that 
often become very destructive when these crops are 
grown continuously. Some investigators have re-
-P-A-G-E-103
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL 89 
cently claimed to have proof that the exudations given 
off in the soil by the roots of certain plants are inju- 
rious to succeeding crops of the same kind. This 
would be an added reason for crop rotation. The 
regions where continuous planting is mostly prac- 
ticed are those that are dependent on a single crop. 
One-crop farming is always dangerous, not only from 
its bad effect on the land, but for economic and busi- 
ness reasons as well. If a farmer grows but one 
crop, he is liable to lose his whole year’s work 
through some unfavorable turn of the season, and if 
he succeeds in making a good crop, his returns from 
it will depend entirely on the course of the market 
for this one staple. Diversified farming is much safer. 
A season that is bad for one crop may be favorable 
for another, and it is seldom that the prices for 
all farm crops are unprofitable in any one year. 
Just what crop rotation to adopt and how closely 
to follow it are questions that will have to be 
answered differently for different localities and al- 
most for every farm. It must differ, not only with 
the locality, but with the kind of business in which 
the farmer is engaged. The stock raiser must adopt 
one rotation, the grain grower another, the cotton 
farmer another, and the truckman still another, if 
indeed the rotation does not lead a man to become a 
stock raiser as well as a grain or cotton grower. 
The general adoption in the cotton belt of a rotation 
that would necessitate the keeping of more live stock 
would be of untold economic benefit besides its great 
effect in preserving soil fertility. The following has 
been suggested as a suitable rotation for upland cot-
-P-A-G-E-104
  90 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
ton fields: first year, cotton; second year, corn with 
cowpeas planted between the rows, the field to serve 
as pasture after the corn is gathered; third year, win- 
ter oats or rye, to serve as winter pasture and to be 
cut for forage in the spring and be followed by 
cowpeas either for hay or to be pastured; fourth 
year, cotton. The general adoption of this or some 
similar rotation would so enrich the land and in- 
crease the yield of cotton per acre that the average 
farm would yield fully as much cotton per year as 
at present and the immense sums paid annually by 
the cotton states for beef, butter, bacon, hams, and 
lard would be saved. Whatever rotation is adopted, 
the main points to keep in mind are to see to it that 
leguminous crops of some kind be included as often 
as possible, that crops requiring clean cultivation 
be interspersed with those that cover and shade the 
soil, and that so far as possible deep-rooted plants 
alternate with shallow-rooted ones, and above all that 
plants liable to the attack of the same insects and 
diseases do not follow each other on the same land. 
With crops that occupy the land continuously for a 
term of years, like orchards or, in the tropics, sugar 
cane, rotation in the sense in which it is used with 
annual crops cannot be practiced. In these cases 
much of the advantage of rotation can be secured 
by alternating clean cultivation with the growth of 
leguminous cover crops. In the case of sugar cane 
the land, too, should always be planted to velvet 
beans or some similar rank-growing legume for a 
year or two, whenever it is necessary to plow up old 
fields before they are again replanted to cane.
-P-A-G-E-105
THE GROWTH OF THE PLANT 91 
Tue GRowTH OF THE PLANT 
The above discussion of soil improvement must 
be considered in connection with a brief considera- 
tion of how plants grow. The study of the life 
processes of plants is the subject-matter of that most 
interesting and important science, vegetable physi- 
ology. A knowledge of its principles is of funda- 
mental importance for the farmer, since agriculture 
is after all only the practical application of vegeta- 
ble physiology and soil physics. At this place only 
the barest outlines of the facts connected with the 
growth of plants can be attempted. 
Within each seed is wrapped up a tiny rudimen- 
tary plantlet called the embryo. This consists of 
one or more seed leaves, the cotyledons, a minute 
bud or growing point called the plumule, and the 
radicle or rudimentary rootlet. There is also a 
greater or less amount of rich food material that has 
been stored either in the thickened seed leaves or in 
an enveloping layer called the endosperm. It is this 
stored food material that gives many seeds such great 
value as food for men and animals. Under favor- 
able conditions of heat and moisture the young 
plantlet begins to grow. The seeds swell, the seed 
coats are ruptured, and the young plant emerges. 
This process is called germination. While it is in 
progress, the stored food material becomes soluble 
and is used to nourish the young plantlet as it 
pushes its first leaves up into the light and the ad- 
vancing root tip is burrowing even more rapidly into 
the soil. If this rootlet is carefully examined, it will 
be seen that for a considerable space just behind the
-P-A-G-E-106
92 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
extreme root tip it is covered with what looks like a 
delicate down or a weft of mold. On magnification 
this down is seen to consist of immense numbers of 
short delicate root hairs. These are the organs for 
absorbing water, together with the small amounts of 
mineral salts that the soil water always holds in | 
solution. They are pressed close to the soil parti- 
cles and so are in immediate contact with the films 
of water that, as we have previously seen, cling to 
each of these particles. After a few days or weeks 
the oldest of these root hairs die, but others are con- 
stantly forming near the younger root tips during 
all the period when the plant is in active growth. 
Although each single root hair is so small as to be 
invisible to the naked eye, their aggregate number 
is so great that their combined surface usually con- 
siderably exceeds the entire leaf surface of the plant. 
The growing of root hairs for absorbing the films of 
moisture that cling to the soil particles is thus seen 
to be the chief function of the roots of agricultural 
plants. Incidentally they also serve as holdfasts 
for anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and pre- 
venting its being blown away by the wind. In some 
special cases, as with the turnip and sweet potato, 
roots also serve as storage organs for holding re- 
serve food supplies. This is always the case with 
these crops in which the root is the part having com- 
mercial value. All that has been written, therefore, 
about the soil and methods forits preparation for crops 
and its improvement is simply to insure that it be in 
proper condition for the roots to ramify freely and de- 
velop root hairs abundantly; and that the films of soil
-P-A-G-E-107
THE GROWTH OF THE PLANT 93 
moisture be present in sufficient quantity and that they 
contain enough of dissolved nutrient salts to provide 
an abundant supply of mineral food elements for the 
growing plants. 
The principal function of the stem is to act as a 
framework on which to hang the leaves and display 
them properly to the action of air and sunlight. It 
also serves as a reservoir of moisture and its vessels 
and tissues provide for the transmission of the water 
and mineral salts absorbed by the roots to the leaves 
in which it is elaborated into plant food. It also 
serves for the distribution of the prepared food from 
the leaves to nourish all parts of the plant. In some 
cases, too, stems like roots become swollen and serve 
as special reserve food storehouses. 
The leaves are the laboratories where the crude 
mineral food elements are combined with the car- 
bonic acid of the air and so elaborated that they can 
be utilized for the nutrition and growth of the plant 
cells. It is this power to utilize mineral elements as 
food that chiefly serves to distinguish plants from 
animals. All green-leaved plants can do this, but 
animals must depend for food on materials that have 
already been elaborated by plants. In almost all 
other respects their life processes are identical. 
Every living cell, whether of plant or animal, must 
have proteids and carbohydrates for food and must 
breathe or absorb oxygen and give off carbonic acid 
as the result of those chemical changes from which 
its vital energy is derived. The plant can make its 
proteids and carbohydrates, the animal cannot. 
Carbonic-acid gas always exists in the atmosphere.
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
It is supplied as the result of combustion, of fermen- 
tation and putrefaction, and from the respiration of 
plants and animals. The ‘process by which it is 
taken up and used as food by green plants is known 
as photosynthesis. This is accomplished by the 
agency of chlorophyll, the green coloring matter of 
the leaves, when this is acted on by strong light. 
During this process carbonic acid is absorbed and 
a considerable quantity of oxygen is liberated, thus 
masking and reversing the ordinary process of respi- 
ration. At night or when in artificial darkness res- 
piration continues and photosynthesis ceases, so that 
then green leaves behave like other living tissues and 
absorb oxygen and give off carbonic acid. Since 
light then plays so important a part in the nutrition 
of plants, we can readily see that the leaves are 
special organs for exposing green chlorophyll-bearing 
tissue to the action of light. This fact has an im- 
portant practical bearing on methods of cultivation. 
Plants that are crowded too closely together can 
never grow as large or develop as rapidly as those 
that have sufficient space in which to unfold their 
leaves. Different kinds of plants vary widely in the 
amount of light which they require in order to attain 
their best development. Some are adapted to the 
dim half light of deep forests and cannot endure 
the full strong sunlight. Others are adapted to the 
open, and thrive best where the light and heat are 
strongest. The agriculturist in the tropics in par- 
ticular must know the requirements of his different 
plants as to light, and must regulate his practices 
accordingly.
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE GROWTH OF THE PLANT 95 
Another important function of the leaves is that 
of throwing off surplus moisture by transpiration. 
As this moisture which.was derived from the soil 
through the agency of the root hairs is given off in 
the form of vapor, all of its dissolved mineral salts 
are left behind in the leaves, where they are com- 
bined with the carbohydrates produced by photosyn- 
thesis to form the complex food substances required 
for the nourishment of the plant cells. The throw- 
ing off of water during transpiration causes the 
leaves to also act as pumping engines and induces 
the constant upward movement of the crude sap. 
In moving trees or plants when in leaf this pumping 
action of the leaves must not be forgotten and the 
leaf surface must be greatly reduced by pruning. 
Otherwise the plant will wither and die from want 
of water before new root hairs can be formed with 
which to absorb it. Deciduous trees should always 
be moved when out of leaf. Even then the top 
should be heavily pruned to avoid too great a dis- 
play of leaf surface in the early spring before the 
new root system has had time to develop. 
In some special cases, as with the cabbage, leaves 
may become so altered as to serve as receptacles for 
storage of reserve food materials. 
Roots, stem, and leaves are all organs that are 
concerned in the growth of the individual plant, but 
the chief office of the flowers is the reproduction of 
new individuals in order to secure the perpetuation 
of the species. Flowers present many variations in 
form, structure, size, and color. In most cases, how- 
ever, there are four sets of organs. The outer, called
-P-A-G-E-110
  96 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
collectively the calyx, are for protection. They are 
usually green in color like the leaves; they serve to 
wrap up and protect the other organs while they 
are young. The next set, called the corolla, are for 
display. They also serve to protect the more im- 
portant organs within, but their chief function 
seems to be to attract insects. The central essential 
organs which are so carefully wrapped up by the calyx 
and corolla also are of two kinds, the stamens and 
pistils. The stamens produce a considerable quan- 
tity of a yellowish powder called the pollen. This 
represents the male element. At the top of the 
pistil is a moist sticky surface called the stigma. 
When a pollen grain falls on this, it adheres to it 
and begins to grow, sending out a slender micro- 
scopic tube which penetrates the tissues of the pistil, 
finally reaching the enlarged base called the ovary, 
where the egg cell or female cell is located. The 
nucleus of the pollen grain passes down through the 
tube, enters the egg cell, and unites with its nucleus, 
—thus effecting fecundation. The fecundated egg 
cell now begins to divide and grows into the rudi- 
mentary plantlet called the embryo. This with its 
surrounding supply of reserve food material and 
its various protective coatings constitutes the seed 
which, when planted under favorable conditions, will 
germinate and grow into a new plant like the one 
from which it sprung. 
It seems to be almost a universal rule in nature 
that the young will be more vigorous when the male 
and female cells from which they spring are not too 
closely related. We therefore find some kinds of 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  INSECTS AND DISEASES 97 
plants where the pistils are borne on one individual 
and the stamens on another. In order to produce 
seed it is necessary for the pollen to be conveyed in 
some manner from one plant to the other. There 
are other cases where the stamens are in separate 
flowers, but borne on different parts of the same plant. 
Even, as is usually the case when both occur in the 
same flower, there are many contrivances to prevent 
the pistils from being pollinated from the same 
flower. All of these cases require what is known as 
cross pollination; that is, the carrying of pollen by 
some means from one flower to another. There are 
some plants, however, where the flowers are normally 
self-pollinated. Even in these cases cross pollina- 
tion undoubtedly often accidentally occurs. Some 
plants produce pollen in immense quantity and de- 
pend on the wind for carrying it from one plant to 
the other. This is a wasteful method and unduly 
taxes the energy of the plant in the production of 
useless pollen. The great majority of plants depend 
on insects of one kind or another to carry pollen 
from flower to flower. The manifold devices that 
have been evolved for securing insect pollina- 
tion constitute one of the most marvelous wonders 
of the vegetable world, and this interrelation be- 
tween plants and insects furnishes a most interesting 
and important field for study. 
INSECTS AND DISEASES 
Cultivated plants of all kinds are liable to be at- 
tacked by insects, and they are, like animals, subject 
to various diseases. The study of the diseases of 
H

  98 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
plants is the province of vegetable pathology. This 
is one of the youngest of the great group of biological 
sciences, since most of our knowledge of plant diseases 
and their remedies has been gained during the last 
twenty-five years. It has, however, the greatest pos- 
sible practical importance for the farmer, for by the 
practice of its teachings he can often save his crops 
from enormous losses. Economic entomology is some- 
times considered as being distinct from vegetable pa- 
thology, but it is really only a branch of that impor- 
tant subject. In a general work of this kind it is 
impossible to give more than the barest outlines of 
pathology, and the reader is referred to special works 
on this subject for a more comprehensive treatment. 
Plant diseases may be divided into three general 
groups: environmental diseases, functional diseases, 
and diseases caused by parasites. In the first group 
are placed all those morbid conditions caused by un- 
congenial soils, lack or excess of water, or bad climatic 
or atmospheric conditions. Here, too, would be 
classed accidental mechanical injuries of all kinds. 
The only possible remedies for diseases of this class 
consist in improving the environment or preventing 
the injuries. If the soil is too wet, it can be drained ; 
if too dry, it can be irrigated ; if too poor, it can be 
fertilized. Atmospheric and climatic difficulties are 
more difficult to avoid, but even here something can 
be done by planting shelter belts, or giving artificial 
protection by fires, tents, sheds, etc. The wise farmer 
will, however, study his surroundings and only plant 
the kinds of crops to which they are best adapted. 
The term “ functional disease”’ is applied to a class 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  INSECTS AND DISEASES 99 
of obscure disorders in which the life processes of the 
plant are disturbed, and the organs fail to perform 
their proper functions without any apparent external 
causes for the abnormal conditions. These diseases 
are as yet poorly understood, and they have not been 
sufficiently studied ; but so far as is known they are 
connected with the improper, either excessive or in- 
sufficient, secretion of enzymes. These are powerful 
chemical ferments that are secreted by many cells. It 
is by their aid that the reserve food stored in so many 
different parts of plants is made soluble and available 
for growth and that many of the other life processes 
are carried forward. ‘The digestive fluids of animals 
also contain enzymes. When these powerful com- 
potinds are produced for any reason at the wrong 
time or in the wrong quantity, serious complications 
follow. Peach yellows and the mosaic disease of 
tobacco may be mentioned as well-known examples 
of functional diseases. So far, unfortunately, no 
remedies are known for this class of troubles, and 
they must still be classed as incurable. 
Insect injuries of all kinds are here grouped under 
the head of diseases caused by parasites, for while 
some of the losses caused by insects are not, strictly 
speaking, diseases at all but only mechanical injuries, 
these grade so imperceptibly into those that cause 
derangement of function or abnormal growth of 
tissue that it is impossible to draw a line between 
them. Parasitic diseases may be classified according 
to the nature of the damage caused, according to the 
part of the plant attacked, or, as is more often done, 
according to the nature of the parasite. Plant parasites
-P-A-G-E-114
100 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
may be either animals or other plants. Plants that 
are parasitic on and cause diseases of our cultivated 
plants are to be found among the bacteria, the slime 
molds, the fungi, and in a few cases even among 
other flowering plants. In warm moist countries 
damage is also sometimes caused by epiphytes. These 
are air plants that do not enter the tissues of the 
plants on which they grew, but they cause trouble by 
crowding and keeping out light and air. Epiphytes 
are found among the alge, the lichens, the mosses and 
liverworts, and among flowering plants. Animals 
causing injury to plants are principally found among 
the nematode worms, the mites, and the insects. Slugs 
and snails which belong to the molusca are also 
troublesome, but their injuries, like those caused ‘by 
the grazing of the higher herbivorous animals, are 
to be classed as mechanical injuries rather than as 
diseases. 
Remedial measures against plant diseases may be 
grouped under hygienic measures, including the 
destruction of sources of contagion and rotation of 
crops; soil treatment; seed treatment ; topical ap- 
plications to the plant itself; and the propagation 
and selection of immune varieties. 
Bacterial diseases are exceedingly common and 
difficult to combat. Pear blight, the bacterial blight 
of potatoes, tomatoes, etc., the black rot of cabbage, 
and the bud rot of the cocoanut may be mentioned 
as typical examples. Hygienic measures, especially 
the destruction of diseased plants or parts of plants, 
and rotation for the annual crops, are as a rule the 
only remedies, and these are far from satisfactory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  INSECTS AND DISEASES 101 
Sprays or other topical applications are useless. The 
most promising work for the future lies in the 
selection of resistant or partially immune varieties 
and strains. 
Slime molds cause but few diseases. The ones 
best known are the club foot of cabbages and turnips 
and the crown gall of peaches and other fruit trees. 
Heavy applications of lime to the soil have been 
shown to be an almost complete preventive for the 
first of these diseases, but no remedy is known for 
the crown gall. 
By far the larger number of vegetable plant para- 
sites are to be found among the fungi. They cause all 
such well-known diseases as smuts, rusts, cankers, 
leaf spots, anthracnoses, scabs, mildews, molds, 
and root rots. The nature of the treatment depends 
largely on the part of the plant attacked. The super- 
ficial powdery mildews can be killed with sulphur. 
Most parasitic fungi, however, penetrate within the 
tissues of the host plant. Those that reach the 
plant from above ground can usually be prevented 
by keeping the plant coated with fungicidal sprays 
like Bordeaux mixture and thus preventing infection. 
Once within the plant tissue the parasite is. safe and. 
cannot be reached by applications. Sprays are thus 
preventive, not curative, an important distinction 
that should never be lost sight of. If the contagion 
reaches the plant from the ground through the roots, it 
cannot be prevented by spraying. In these cases soil 
treatment is sometimes available, but reliance must 
mainly be had onrotation of crops. Many smuts may 
be prevented by treating the seed. Relief from fungous 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    102 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
diseases is sometimes possible through the finding of 
immune varieties or through better cultural methods. 
The dodders and broom rapes are among the best- 
known parasitic flowering plants. They are usually 
pests of minor importance and like other weeds 
should be eradicated by preventing the forming of 
seed. 
Nematode worms are minute microscopic animals, 
some of which are parasitic on plants. The worst 
damage is done by one that causes gall-like swellings 
on the roots of many of our cultivated plants. They 
are very troublesome on many sandy soils in the South- 
ern states and other warm countries, and they are 
also a serious pest in greenhouses. Here they may 
be destroyed by thoroughly sterilizing the soil with 
live steam before placing it in pots or trenches. In 
the fields nematodes can only be combated by care- 
ful crop rotation. 
The mites are minute -animals related to the spi- 
ders. Only a comparatively few kinds of them are 
troublesome, but they include such well-known pests 
as the various red spiders and the rust mite of the 
orange. Applications of sulphur are usually the most 
effective remedy for mites. It may be applied as a 
powder by means of the so-called powder gun, or it 
may be suspended in water with a little flour paste 
to make it stick and be applied as a spray. 
By far the greatest number of animal plant pests 
belong to the insects. An immense variety of species 
prey on gur cultivated plants in countless numbers and 
do damage of a great many different kinds. For prac- 
tical purposes, however, they may all be considered
-P-A-G-E-117
  INSECTS AND DISEASES 103 
under three groups: burrowing insects, biting insects, 
and sucking insects. No general rule can be given for 
the treatment of burrowing insects. Each one must 
be carefully studied by itself to see at what stage of 
its life history it can be most successfully attacked. 
Often the eggsare laid onthe surface of their food plant, 
and the young feed for a short time superficially 
before beginning to burrow. In such cases they may 
be killed by arsenical sprays like other biting insects. 
In other cases it is possible to prevent the depositing 
of eggs by various protective measures. The one 
almost universal remedy for biting insects is to poison 
them by spraying their food plants with some arseni- 
eal compound. Sucking insects have mouth parts 
arranged for piercing the epidermis of the food plant 
and sucking out the elaborated sap. They are much 
more difficult to reach than most biting insects since 
they cannot be killed by arsenical poisons. It is nec- 
essary to employ what are known as contact poisons ; 
that is, some substance that will kill the insects by 
simply coming in contact with it. The principal 
contact poisons are kerosene, whale-oil soap, resin mix- 
ture, tobacco extract, and pyrethrum powder. The 
first three are much the strongest and most effective, 
but they have to be used with great care or they will 
injure the plants. Tobacco extract is only used for 
very soft-bodied insects like plant lice. Pyrethrum 
powder is safe and will not injure the most delicate 
plant. When fresh it is quite effective, but it soon 
loses its strength, and the commercial article is often 
unsatisfactory. In greenhouses fumigation with 
tobacco smoke is more effective than spraying with
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
tobacco extract, and a standard remedy for scale in- 
sects on fruit trees is to cover them with a tent and 
fumigate with hydrocyanic-acid gas. 
Spraying for insects and fungi has now become so 
important a part of the best farm practice in the 
production of many crops that the subject demands 
a little fuller consideration even in a work of this 
kind. Spray pumps for applying insecticides and 
fungicides are now on the market in almost every 
conceivable form and size, from the little hand atom- 
izer with a reservoir holding a quart or less to 
powerful machines with pumps run by gasoline 
engines and tanks holding hundreds of gallons. 
Spraying is now a recognized necessity in the pro- 
duction of nearly all tree fruits and of many vege- 
tables. It is almost universally used for potatoes, but 
is too expensive to be employed for most other ordi- 
nary farm crops. Tobacco and cotton growers usu- 
ally apply insecticides in the form of a powder. 
The substances mostly used for spraying are, first, 
the arsenic compounds, Paris green, London purple, 
white arsenic, and arsenate of lead. These are the 
recognized remedies for biting insects. Second, the 
contact poisons used for sucking insects: kerosene, 
either as the mechanical mixture with water or the 
emulsion, whale-oil soap solution, resin-lime mixture, 
and tobacco extract. Third, various copper com- 
pounds used as fungicides. The most important by 
far is Bordeaux mixture. Paris green is often 
added to Bordeaux mixture, thus affording protec- 
tion from the biting insects and fungi by the one 
spraying. Fourth, sulphur in suspension or potas-

106 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
sium sulphide in solution as a remedy against mites 
and powdery mildews. Formulas for these different 
sprays are as follows: — : 
Paris Green. — Use 4 ounces to 50 gallons of water or 
of Bordeaux mixture. Keep constantly agitated. Two 
pounds of flour boiled to a paste may be added to the 
water when used alone. Limewater used with Paris 
green prevents burning of foliage. To apply as powder, 
mix with 20 to 30 parts of flour, slacked lime, or finely 
sifted wood ashes. 
London Purple.— Use the same as Paris green. Its 
composition is variable and its use not always satisfac- 
tory. 
Arsenite of Lime.— Boil 1 pound of white arsenic in 
4 quarts of water. Use this to slack 2 pounds good quick- 
lime. Add water to make 2 gallons as stock mixture. 
For use add 1 quart to each barrel of water or Bordeaux 
mixture. 
Arsenate of Lead. — Add 1 to 2 pounds to 50 gallons of 
water or Bordeaux. It burns foliage less than Paris green. 
Kerosene Emulsion. — Boil } pound laundry soap in 1 
gallon soft water. While hot, add 2 gallons kerosene and 
churn violently 5 to 10 minutes. Dilute with 4 to 20 
parts of water before using. (Strong emulsions are for 
scale insects in winter.) 
Kerosene in Mechanical Mixture. — Use special pump. 
Set to throw 5 per cent to 25 per cent of kerosene. 
Crude Petroleum. — Use same as kerosene. 
Whale-oil Soap. — Use 12 to 15 pounds of the potash 
soap for each 50 gallons of water. 
Resin Mixture. — Boil 20 pounds resin, 5 pounds caustic 
soda, and 3 pints fish oil with 20 gallons of water for at 
least 8 hours. Add hot water to make 50 gallons. Use 
in winter. For use on foliage dilute to 150 gallons.
-P-A-G-E-121
MARKETING PRODUCTS 107 
Sulphur-lime Mixture. — Mix 18 pounds flowers of sul- 
phur with 50 gallons boiling water. Slowly add 21 
pounds quicklime. Boil 30 to 50 minutes. 
Tobacco Extract.— Cover a quantity of tobacco stems 
with boiling water and allow to stand 5 hours. Dilute 
with 4 parts of water. Or use 1 pint commercial “ Rose 
Leaf” tobacco extract to from 10 to 20 parts of water. 
Sulphur. — Use as a powder; or add 3 to 5 pounds to 
50 gallons of water containing 2 pounds of flour boiled to 
a paste and apply as a spray. Agitate thoroughly. 
Potassium Sulphide. — Two to three pounds potassium 
sulphide, water 50 gallons. Use at once. 
Bordeaux Mixture. — Dissolve 6 pounds of copper sul- 
phate in 25 gallons of water. (This is best done by sus- 
pending it in a coarse sack near the top of the water.) In 
another barrel slack 6 pounds of quicklime and dilute to 
25 gallons. Pour the lime wash slowly into the copper- 
sulphate solution and stir well. Use at once. For 
peaches use only 2 pounds copper sulphate. 
Ammoniacal Copper Carbonate. — Dissolve 5 ounces cop- 
per carbonate in 3 pints of strong ammonia (26° Beaumé) 
that has been diluted with 8 parts of water. Add water, 
50 gallons. Use in place of Bordeaux when staining by 
the latter is objectionable. 
In all spraying operations success will depend on 
the thoroughness with which the work is done, and 
on the judgment with which the work is timed. 
As most sprays are preventive rather than cura- 
tive it is usually necessary to begin the work before 
any sign of the trouble appears. 
MARKETING PRopUCTS 
It is not only necessary to grow good crops, but 
they must be sold. The successful farmer must bea 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  108 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
good business man as well as a good agriculturist. 
Farm crops are produced for use at home or on the 
farm ; for sale in the market of the home town that 
can be reached direct by the farmer’s wagon; for 
shipment to some distant market requiring the use of 
railroad or water transportation; or for export to 
some foreign market. 
It should be the first duty of every farmer to see 
that his home table is always abundantly supplied 
with all the food products that can be produced in 
his neighborhood. No one is so favorably situated 
for living well as the farmer. With only slight ad- 
ditional effort and expense he can always have the 
best and freshest of fruits and vegetables, eggs, milk, 
and butter. Those who live in towns know how ex- 
pensive it is to keep their tables supplied with these 
products and how difficult or often impossible it is to 
get them in really fresh appetizing condition. Yet 
how many farmers there are who fail to avail them- 
selves of this, which is one of their greatest privileges, 
but spend their hard-earned money for buying from the 
groceries inferior foods that have been shippedin from 
some neighboring city market. Such a condition is 
almost unbelievable, but it is socommon as to be the 
rule rather than the exception. It will be a great 
day for the average health and prosperity of the 
country when every farmer realizes that the crops 
consumed on his home table are the most profitable 
ones he can grow and when each takes a pride in 
seeing how near he can come to “living at home.” 
Other crops that are consumed on the farm are, of 
course, mostly the grain and forage fed to animals.
-P-A-G-E-123
  MARKETING PRODUCTS 109 
This is marketed later in the form of eggs, milk, or 
meat. Animal husbandry isa very important branch 
of agriculture, but its bearings will be discussed under 
another heading. 
Crops grown for the home market are usually sold 
direct to the consumer, or at most only pass through 
the hands of the local grocer asa middleman. This is 
a very simple and on many accounts a very desirable 
business arrangement. The farmer can consult the 
needs and tastes of his customers and by supplying 
their wants he can be reasonably sure of fair prices 
for his products regardless of the fluctuation in the 
great market centers. By careful attention to grow- 
ing his crops well and preparing them for market 
attractively he can soon make a local reputation for 
his goods that will always secure a ready sale, and he 
has the great advantage of being able to grow and 
sell a diversity of crops. The man who grows only 
one or two market crops runs greater risks of loss 
from an unfavorable season or from the fluctuations 
of the market than the one who has a number of dif- 
ferent crops. Weather conditions that injure one may 
benefit others, and it is seldom indeed that prices for 
all farm products are disastrously low at the same 
time. With perishable products the grower for the 
home market has the further advantage of being able 
to sell them when fresh and in the best condition, and 
he is not liable to the heavy losses due to deterioration 
in transit so often met by those who ship such crops 
to a distance. It is indeed remarkable how often 
the advantages of a home market are overlooked and 
in how many cases small towns and rural communities
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
are poorly supplied with the very things that might 
be produced in the neighborhood in the greatest 
abundance. 
With crops grown for distant shipment a distinc- 
tion must be made between what are called staple 
farm products and those, like fruits and vegetables, 
that are of a perishable nature. The former crops, 
like wheat, corn, cotton, etc., are usually sold at the 
nearest shipping point either to local speculators or 
to representatives of the great commercial interests 
at prices fixed from day to day by their value in the 
great world’s markets and by the transportation 
charges necessary to reach these markets. The price 
received depends but little on the efforts of the 
farmer and is only too often manipulated by the com- 
mercial interests so that it shall be abnormally low at 
the season that the crop is being marketed followed 
by a marked rise as soon as the bulk of the crop has 
passed out of the hands of the producers and_ before 
it passes to the consumers. This constantly tempts 
the grain and cotton farmer to turn speculator and to 
hold his crop for a rise in value. 
Perishable crops, too, are often sold direct by the 
farmer to produce merchants or local speculators. 
Sales of such products at the point of production are 
probably slowly increasing, but the risks attending 
the handling. and storing of such products are so 
great that a very large part of the fruit and vege- 
tables produced are shipped at the farmer’s risk, and 
are sold for his account on commission. This system 
leaves the farmer entirely at the mercy of unscrupu- 
lous commission men and, unfortunately, there are
-P-A-G-E-125
  MARKETING PRODUCTS 111 
some of this kind, as well as many honest ones, and 
it has many other manifest disadvantages. The very 
fact, however, that so large a proportion of the im- 
mense volume of produce business is still done on 
this basis shows that there must be other weighty 
points in its favor. There can be no question but 
that, as a general rule, it is much better and safer for 
the farmer to accept a fair, reasonable price for his prod- 
uce at home rather than to take the risk of shipping 
it on commission ; yet this very element of risk seems 
to be an attraction, and it is often much more diffi- 
cult for produce merchants to buy their supplies in 
the country than to buy them from the commission 
men after shipment. The principal reason, however, 
why direct buying has not become more general, is 
the great difficulty of securing goods of a known and 
uniform quality. The staple products are all graded 
and sold by sample, so that the quality of any given 
lot is pretty accurately known. This is not possible 
with fruits and vegetables, where the quality and 
value of the same lot may vary so widely from day to 
day. The best remedy so far devised to meet this 
condition lies in the formation of shipping associa- 
tions and the establishment of codperative packing 
houses, where all the produce of a neighborhood can 
be brought in, and be assorted and packed uniformly. 
Each packing house of this kind handles enough 
produce so that its goods become known on the 
market, and this is a great advantage either in 
making direct sales or in selling on commission. 
To successfully carry on a large business in the 
growing and shipping of perishable fruits and vege-
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
tables requires a rare combination of abilities. Be- 
sides exceptional skill as an agriculturist in the 
production of the crops and the usual commercial 
ability required in the transaction of any large busi- 
ness, one requires to have a wide knowledge of 
market conditions and requirements in different 
parts of the country, and to be a close student of 
transportation problems. He must also have the 
ability to impress his views on the transportation 
companies. None of the modern improvements in 
transporting perishable goods have come on the ini- 
tiative of the transportation companies. Fast fruit 
trains, ventilated cars, and finally the vast system 
of refrigerator transportation, all have come on the 
insistent demand of clear-sighted farmers who real- 
ized how much the growth and extension of their 
business depended on obtaining improved transporta- 
tion facilities. 
The shipping of agricultural products to foreign 
countries is mostly in the hands of the large com- 
mercial interests, and is but little done by the farm- 
ers themselves. It therefore need not be discussed 
here. No matter what market crops are intended 
for, the fact should never be lost sight of that suc- 
cess will depend quite as much on the care and skill 
with which the marketing is done as on the ability 
to produce large crops. 
Farm Pouicy AND MANAGEMENT 
In this age of specialization it has come to pass 
that there are many kinds of farms and many 
methods of farming. One of the first and most im-
-P-A-G-E-127
  FARM POLICY AND MANAGEMENT 113 
portant questions that confronts the agriculturist is 
to decide what kind of a farmer he wants to be and 
what kinds of farming will give best results under 
his special local conditions. In making his decision 
he must consult, not only his own preferences and 
abilities and his available capital, but the nature of 
his soil and climate and particularly the character 
and needs of his available markets and his transpor- 
tation facilities. A certain amount of specialization 
is undoubtedly desirable. The man who undertakes 
to grow too many crops will succeed with none of 
them. There are many cases, too, where either on 
account of special skill and knowledge or peculiarly 
favorable local conditions a farmer’s wisest course is 
to confine himself exclusively to some one or two 
specialties. In general, however, diversified farming 
is safer and more profitable and lends itself much 
more readily to a proper rotation of crops and the 
preservation of the fertility of the land. The all- 
wheat, all-corn, or all-cotton farmer is seldom per- 
manently prosperous and he inevitably leaves an 
inheritance of depleted acres to his successors. 
The average farmer should first and foremost see 
to it that he produces at home, so far as possible, 
everything that is to be consumed on the farm. 
Second, he should study the possibilities of his local 
market carefully and seek as far as possible to 
supply it. The man who produces the bulk of his 
own supplies and sells enough produce to his neigh- 
bors to furnish his other necessities is assured of 
success no matter what the state of the market for 
the great staples. It is true that it takes more care I
-P-A-G-E-128
  114 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
and trouble on the part of the farmer and his family 
to do a retail business of this kind than to dispose of 
a grain or cotton crop to some larger dealer, but the 
result will usually amply repay the extra effort. 
Many farmers are, of course, so located that they 
cannot take advantage of local markets, but neglected. 
opportunities of this kind are to be found on every 
hand. Extensive observation in many regions gives 
convincing proof that very few towns and cities 
have a really adequate home supply of those prod- 
ucts that could be easily produced in the neighbor- 
hood. The abandoned farms in New England bear 
eloquent testimony to the shiftlessmess and incom- 
petence of their owners. It is true they could no 
longer produce hay and grain in competition with 
the richer level lands of the West, but the country 
has a dense manufacturing population and there is 
not one of these abandoned places that is not in easy 
reach of some prosperous town which is compelled 
to draw the bulk of its food supplies from the great 
markets of New York and Boston. The lands 
within a hundred miles of New York City are nearly 
all excellently adapted to small fruits, but it is a 
notorious fact that when the local season comes on 
berries are scarcer and higher in that market than 
when they are being brought from the Carolinas and 
from Delaware and Maryland. On account of their 
favorable soil and climatic conditions, which permit of 
the cultivation of many temperate as well as of all 
tropical products, the farmers of Cuba are in a posi- 
tion to produce a very unusually large variety of 
crops. As a matter of fact they devote themselves 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
FARM POLICY AND MANAGEMENT 115 
so exclusively to sugar cane and tobacco that the 
towns are very poorly supplied with even the com- 
monest fruits and vegetables, and immense quantities 
of such food products as corn, beans, rice, and pota- 
toes are annually imported. 
It is usually only those farmers who are located 
near the large centers of population that can find a 
local market for all of their produce, and it becomes 
necessary for them to devote at least a part of their 
energies to the production of some staple to be sold 
in the great markets. The nature of this staple 
must depend largely on transportation facilities. 
Those farmers who are distant from railroad or 
water transportation must depend on live stock 
which can carry itself to some shipping point, or on 
products like coffee or tobacco that are valuable 
enough in proportion to their weight to stand ex- 
pensive transportation by wagon or pack train. In 
most of the more inaccessible regions the live-stock 
industry is the only available kind of agriculture. 
The importance of live stock is, however, not con- 
fined to such out-of-the-way places. On every farm 
there are unsalable products of various kinds that 
can best be utilized by feeding to live stock. Thus 
half the feeding value of a crop of corn is in the 
leaves and stalks. This is lost if only the ears are 
gathered and sold. The straw from small grain and 
the seed of cotton are useful stock foods, and so with 
many other products. Whenever possible, enough 
live stock should be kept on every farm to utilize 
all products that would otherwise be wasted. An- 
other very obvious advantage from keeping live © 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
stock is the production of a home supply of manure. 
When cattle or other domestic animals are properly 
handled, we get good value for the food consumed 
in the milk or meat produced, and we also get back 
at least three fourths of the fertilizer value of the 
food in the form of manure. Many farmers are con- 
tent to buy and feed cattle when the advance price at 
which they can be sold no more than pays for the 
food consumed as they consider that the value of the 
manure secured constitutes a good profit. This 
feature of stock raising should be carefully con- 
sidered in connection with what has been previ- 
ously said in regard to the raising of leguminous 
crops for soil improvement as part of a crop rota- 
tion. The best possible use to make of a leguminous 
crop is to feed it to live stock. The legumes make 
rich feed since they contain so large a per cent of 
nitrogen, and when the crop is properly saved and 
fed the farmer gets a full return for its food value, 
and in the manure saved he has nearly its full fer- 
tilizer value as well. The average Southern farmer 
will make no mistake if, after setting aside sufficient 
land for gardens and orchards for supplying his own 
table and selling to his less provident neighbors, he 
shall divide his other fields in such a way as to 
secure in his rotation at least two crops of cowpeas 
or other legume every three years and shall keep 
enough hogs and cattle to consume the legumes and 
other waste products. The amount of corn, cotton, 
or other staple crop sold will, in a series of years, 
from the improved condition of his soil, be fully 
as great as if all his land had been devoted con-
-P-A-G-E-131

tinuously to his one staple crop. He will have in 
addition the profits derived from his live stock and 
the greatly increased value of his lands. 
The production of fruits and vegetables for distant 
shipment is a highly specialized line of agriculture 
and as a rule should only be embarked in by those 
having some special knowledge of or aptitude for 
the business. In this industry proper transportation 
facilities are the very first desideratum. Suitable 
soil and climatic conditions must also be carefully 
considered as well as an available supply of labor. 
For many reasons it is usually better for one who 
contemplates beginning in the fruit or vegetable 
business to go to some point where it is already 
successfully established. A beginner ina new region 
will encounter many difficulties that would be already 
solved for him at these recognized centers of the 
industry.

SuGaR CANE (Saccharum officinarum L.) 
Tus giant among the grasses is supposed to be a 
native of southern Asia, but it is now one of the 
most important economic crops of tropical and sub- 
tropical countries in all parts of the world. Formerly 
it was practically the only source for the world’s 
sugar supply since the amounts made from maple sap, 
from sorghum, and the sugar palm have always been 
so small as to be negligible. Of recent years, however, 
the sugar beet has been so improved by seed selection 
and better methods of cultivation that it has become 
a formidable competitor, and to-day it furnishes fully 
half the sugar that findsits way to the world’s markets. 
The history of the beet-sugar industry is very instruc- 
tive, since it illustrates so forcibly the immense im- 
provement that may be made in agricultural methods as 
the result of persistent scientific study. A hundred 
years ago beets contained about five per cent of sugar. 
To-day the best strains of seed yield fifteen per cent 
to twenty per cent, and the tonnage obtained per 
acre has also been considerably increased. ‘This is 
no chance result, but it has come from steady and per- 
sistent effort in plant breeding and in methods of 
118
-P-A-G-E-133

cultivation and the use of fertilizers. Improvements 
in manufacture have also kept pace with these im- 
provements in production, and the business is now one 
of the best examples of a scientifically conducted agri- 
cultural industry. Sugar beets can be grown in many 
parts of the region that itis intended to cover by this 
volume, but since it is not yet a recognized South- 
ern industry, no discussion of the question will be 
undertaken. 
While these great improvements have been going on 
with beets, methods of cultivating sugar cane have in 
most countries practically stood still. The greater part 
of the world’s supply is still produced by the methods 
in vogue a hundred years ago. Signs of progress are, 
however, not wanting. In certain countries, par- 
ticularly Louisiana, Hawaii, and Australia, cultural 
methods have been revolutionized with the result of 
markedly increasing the yield and lessening the cost 
of production. These changes in method have largely 
been due to the initiative of the agricultural experi- 
ment stations which have been established in these 
countries. In Java, too, where much good scientific 
work has been done, there has been notable progress 
along many lines ; but owing to the high price of 
land and the abundance of cheap labor, cultivation 
there is still done by hand implements. In the other 
countries mentioned hand labor has been almost 
completely superseded except in the harvesting of 
the cane, with the usual result of greatly decreasing 
the cost of production. 
Chief Uses. — Sugar cane is, of course, principally 
used for the production of sugar, with molasses, rum,
-P-A-G-E-134
120 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
and alcohol as by-products. In some regions where 
cane is only produced on a small scale the juice 
is mostly converted into table syrup instead of 
being boiled down enough to make sugar. With 
the old method of open-kettle manufacture much of 
the molasses was also used for the table, but with the 
modern vacuum-pan methods the sugar is extracted 
so much more completely that the resulting molasses 
is used only for stock food or for distillation. 
Sugar cane is also used as a forage. It is well liked 
by cattle, horses, and hogs. Doubtless cane could 
profitably be used much more widely for feeding 
purposes than it is at present. The yield of forage 
per acre is larger than that afforded by any other 
crop. 
Climatic Conditions. — Cane thrives in all parts of 
the tropics where there is sufficient rainfall or where 
it can be irrigated. It is not confined to strictly 
tropical countries, but can be grown with greater or 
less success as far north as central Alabama and 
Mississippi. Cane would grow vigorously much 
farther north than this, but the seasons are not 
long enough for it to mature properly and gain its 
full sweetness, and there would be much difficulty 
in keeping the seed canes over winter. In fact in 
practice the northern limit of its cultivation is 
largely determined by the possibility of wintering 
the seed cane. The distribution of the rainfall is a 
very important matter in successful cane growing. 
Abundant moisture is needed throughout the entire 
growing season in order to secure heavy yields, but 
dry weather in which to mature and harvest the 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  SUGAR CANE 121 
crop is equally essential. The best climate for cane 
is one where the rainy season lasts uninterruptedly 
for six or eight months and is then followed by a 
well-marked dry season for the remainder of the 
year. Continuous rainy weather gives no chance 
for the ripening and harvesting of the cane. 
Soils.— Moist, heavy, rich soils are considered the 
best for cane, and its commerical cultivation is usu- 
ally confined to lands of this character. Surface 
drainage is, however, essential, and low-lying lands 
with a retentive subsoil must be thoroughly ditched. 
As a matter of fact cane will grow splendidly on 
light sandy soils if moisture conditions are right, but 
such soils are very soon exhausted and require heavy 
applications of fertilizers. The poor, sandy pine 
woodlands of southern Mississippi, Alabama, and 
Georgia yield enormous crops by cane when ‘“ cow- 
penned” or otherwise heavily enriched. It is, how- 
ever, only grown in these regions on a small scale 
for syrup making. In Louisiana and Texas com- 
mercial cane planting is mostly confined to the rich 
alluvial river lands. Here drainage is a prime ne- 
cessity and much expensive ditching has to be done. 
Special methods of cultivation, too, have been devised 
to meet these soil conditions. In Hawaii the soils 
are mostly lighter in character and are largely of 
volcanic origin. Most of the larger estates are 
located in regions of insufficient rainfall, where it is 
necessary to employ irrigation. This, of course, pro- 
foundly affects methods of cultivation. In Cuba 
three distinct types of cane soils may be recognized. 
First, the red lands; these are heavy, tenacious soils,
-P-A-G-E-136
    122 THE oun SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
but they have a jointed structure that allows the 
rains to pass down very readily. They have no 
subsoil, but extend downward unaltered to the bed 
tock, which consists of a cavernous coralline lime- 
stone with many underground channels through 
which the water is quickly carried away, thus afford- 
ing perfect underdrainage. These soils are admir- 
able during the rainy season, but suffer somewhat 
during the dry season. In Cuba these seasons are 
usually quite well marked, the summer being wet 
and the winter dry. Second are the heavy black 
soils overlying a white, calcareous, chalklike sub- 
soil. These lands are usually undulating or even 
hilly, so that surface drainage is good and no ditch- 
ing is required except in occasional low places. 
Third are the heavy, black, level soils underlaid by a 
retentive clay subsoil. These are very productive 
when properly handled, but would all be improved by 
additional ditching. The cane lands in the other 
West India islands and in Mexico and Central 
America are of various kinds, but so far as their 
cultural requirements are concerned they are compar- 
able to some one or the other of the ones mentioned 
above. 
Methods of Cultivation; Louisiana. —The methods 
of cultivation on the best Louisiana plantations may 
be briefly summarized as follows. It must be remem- 
bered that here the two chief aims are to get rid of 
surplus water and to secure the early maturity of 
the crop. A three-year rotation is usually practiced, 
two years in cane and one year in corn and cowpeas. 
After the second crop of cane is harvested the land
-P-A-G-E-137
  SUGAR CANE 123 
is plowed and is planted to corn very early in the 
spring. At the last cultivation of the corn, cowpeas 
are broadcasted at the rate of one to three bushels 
per acre. After the corn is gathered these produce 
an immense mass of vegetation which together with 
the corn stalks are plowed under with a disk plow dur- 
ing the latter part of summer. In about four weeks 
the vines will have rotted enough so that the land 
can be bedded. This is done with a large two-horse 
turning plow, and the beds or ridges are thrown 
up about six to seven feet apart. These beds are 
crossed by quarter drains at sufficiently frequent in- 
tervals, which lead into the larger ditches and these 
in turn into large drainage canals, so that any exces- 
sive rainfall is quickly carried away. Planting be- 
gins about the first of October or as soon as the seed 
cane is sufficiently mature to insure good germina- 
tion. Planting furrows are opened in the top of the 
ridges with a double moldboard plow, but this fur- 
row should not be quite as deep as the water furrow 
between the rows. Two rows of seed cane are laid 
in the bottom of this furrow, which is then filled in 
five or six inches deep by means of the disk cultiva- 
tor. It is covered thus deeply to protect the seed 
cane from freezing during the winter. The cane is 
planted full length as it is found to keep better than 
when cut in short pieces. About four tons of seed 
cane are required per acre. Planting is usually in- 
terrupted at the beginning of the grinding season in 
November. On most plantations it is necessary to 
make spring plantings also. For this purpose seed 
cane must be carried over winter by the process
-P-A-G-E-138
  124 THE Caen SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
known as windrowing. ‘The cane cut from two rows 
is carefully piled in the water furrow between them 
in such a way that the stalks of one armful are 
completely covered by the tops of the next. When 
the windrow is completed, only a continuous row of 
tops and leaves is visible. Furrows are now thrown 
from either side with large plows and the work of 
completely covering with dirt is finished with hoes. 
In severe winters the windrowed cane is sometimes 
damaged so that a larger quantity of seed will be 
required to secure a stand. With the first warm 
days of spring the dirt is thrown from the sides of 
the beds with the plow and the greater part of the 
earth which covers the cane is scraped off with 
hoes. This lets in the warmth of the sun and pro- 
motes early germination. Fertilizer is now scat- 
tered in the side furrows and as soon as germination 
is completed the dirt is thrown back with a turning 
plow and the water furrows are cleaned out with the 
double moldboard plow. The subsequent cultiva- 
tion is all done with disk cultivators, which throw 
still more dirt to the rows, and with the Magnolia or 
some other similar form of cultivator for the water 
furrows. No hoeing is needed after the first scrap- 
ing of the dirt from the seed canes. In fact even 
this is sometimes done with a special implement de- 
vised for the purpose. When the cane tops begin to 
meet between the rows, it is “laid by,” by again 
cleaning the water furrows with the double mold- 
board and opening up the quarter drains, which 
should be six inches deeper than the bottom of the 
water furrows. After the harvest the land is left
-P-A-G-E-139
SUGAR CANE 125 
covered with a great accumulation of trash, consist- 
ing of the cane tops and leaves. This is burned 
over at the first suitable opportunity in. order to kill 
the cane borer, but more particularly in order to 
prevent it from clogging the drains and water fur- 
rows and thus keeping the land too wet and cold 
during the winter. This is recognized as a great 
waste of fertility since so much vegetable matter is 
destroyed that ought to be reincorporated with the 
soil. Under these special conditions, however, its 
advantages are found to considerably outweigh its 
very obvious disadvantages. It must be remem- 
bered that in this short rotation an abundant supply 
of vegetable matter is returned to the soil every three 
years with the corn stalks and pea vines. The 
burning, too, clears the ground for the subsequent 
cultivation of the stubble cane. In the early spring 
an implement known as a stubble digger is passed 
over the rows to loosen up the ground between the 
stubbles. If the upper buds of the stubble have been 
injured by the winter, another implement, known as 
the stubble shaver, may first be passed over the row 
to cut off these injured tops below the surface of the 
ground. As soon as the stubbles begin to sprout the 
/ rows are barred off, fertilized, rebedded, and culti- 
vated exactly like the plant cane. 
The fertilizers used in Louisiana for cane are 
largely the phosphates though nitrogenous manures 
are also employed. Potash does not seem to be 
needed. This is probably to be explained by the 
well-known fact that the phosphates tend to hasten 
maturity, a point so important for Louisiana, while  
-P-A-G-E-140
    126 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
potash has the contrary effect of prolonging the 
period of vigorous growth. 
Most unfortunately for the sugar-cane industry 
the harvesting as yet has to be done by hand. This 
requires a much larger force of laborers than the culti- 
vation, and at the present time constitutes the most 
difficult problem that confronts the cane grower. 
A successful mechanical harvester is a great desider- 
atum. The great weight of the crop to be handled 
and the fact that it is usually badly tangled by 
storms are serious obstacles to be overcome, but the 
worst difficulty is that judgment has to be used as 
to the height at which to top the cane in order not to 
waste it on the one hand by cutting too low or by 
cutting too high to include immature tops which 
carry impurities that prevent the crystallization of 
the sugar. Whether these difficulties can ever be 
successfully solved remains for the future to decide. 
A successful machine for cutting cane already exists 
and it is sometimes employed in windrowing, but 
ordinarily it is not found to have much advantage 
over hand cutting. There are now several fairly suc- 
cessful devices for loading cane into carts or wagons, 
after it is thrown in piles by the cutters and others 
for transferring it from carts to railroad cars and 
from the cars to the conveyor at the mill. It is 
thus seen that cutting and stripping are practically 
the only hand work remaining in the Louisiana cane 
. fields. 
Methods of Cultivation: Hawaiian Islands.— Cli- 
matic and soil conditions are exceedingly variable in 
different parts of the Hawaiian Islands, and cultural
-P-A-G-E-141
SUGAR CANE 127 
methods must be correspondingly varied. On the 
moist windward sides of the islands, where there is 
abundant rainfall, the methods employed are essen- 
tially those of Louisiana except that the planting 
ridges are omitted, since the soils are permeable, but 
the earth is worked toward the row during cultiva- 
tion. One row only of seed cane is used and rows 
are spaced five to six and a half feet apart. In 
the dry regions on the leeward side, where most of 
the more important plantations are located, irrigation 
is needed. This is supplied in some cases from 
natural streams and in others by pumping. Great 
attention is given to the proper preparation of the 
land. Where the nature of the soil will permit, it is 
broken two or even three feet deep with powerful 
steam plows and it is very thoroughly pulverized. 
Planting furrows five feet apart and twenty to 
twenty-five inches deep are made with large double 
moldboard plows. The bottom of this furrow is 
pulverized by a subsoil plow or some special pulver- 
izing implement. Usually the tops of the cane only 
are used for seed. A single line is placed in the 
bottom of the furrow, a light irrigation is given, and 
the seed cane is covered with two or three inches of 
dry earth by hoes. No general cultivation is at- 
tempted nor is it needed in this deeply prepared soil 
that does not become compacted by heavy rains. 
After each irrigation a light fresh coating of dry 
dirt is added with hoes to check evaporation. After 
the harvest the trash is burned as in Louisiana. On 
many plantations the earth is now plowed toward 
the stubble with turning plows, and the subsequent
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 THE cutee SOUTHERN Chto AOL CROPS 
irrigation is applied in the water furrow. As a rule 
only one or at most two crops of stubble cane are 
harvested, after which the field is plowed up and again 
replanted. The chief feature of the Hawaiian culti- 
vation is the immense amount of commercial ferti- 
lizer used. Practically no cane is planted without it, 
even on virgin lands, the quantity applied running 
from six hundred to as high as fifteen hundred pounds 
per acre. Complete fertilizers are usually employed, 
and two or even three applications are made during 
the year. The exact formula used and the method of 
application varies considerably on the different planta- 
tions, but the tendency is to employ a large per cent 
of potash. No such necessity exists here for forcing 
early maturity as is foundin Louisiana. The largest 
yields of sugar known in any part of the world are 
obtained on these highly fertilized, irrigated planta- 
tions. They reach more than sixty tons of cane per 
acre with a sugar production of over eight tons. 
Methods of Cultivation: Cuba.— At present Cuba 
is passing through a transition period in regard to 
methods of cane cultivation. Formerly cane was 
planted exclusively on new lands. The forest was 
cut down, fire was applied to the tangled mass of vege- 
tation, and pieces of cane were planted among the 
blackened logs and stumps by simply thrusting them 
into holes made by crowbars. No preparation of the 
land was attempted and no cultivation was given or 
required. Sprouts and vines which sprung up were 
cut down occasionally with the hoe or machete. The 
soil was originally so fertile and the climate so con- 
genial to cane production that even with this crude
-P-A-G-E-143
  SUGAR CANE 129 
method immense crops of cane were produced for 
many successive years without the necessity of re- 
planting. After the cane was harvested the trash 
was allowed to lie on the ground as a mulch and this 
wasa powerful aid inkeeping down weeds and grasses. 
Such as did appear were chopped out occasionally by 
the hoe. Such fields continued to yield annual crops 
of cane without replanting for fifteen or twenty or on 
very rich lands even for thirty or forty years. There 
are still forest lands in eastern Cuba where this same 
system is being followed with the greatest success. 
In the older sugar districts, however, the forests have 
long since disappeared and the lands have been plowed 
and replanted many times. Continued cropping with- 
out the use of restorative measures has had its inevi- 
table result. Crops have gradually grown smaller 
and fields have required replanting at constantly 
shorter intervals till finally they have been abandoned 
or used for pasturage. Every old sugar mill is sur- 
rounded by thousands of acres of such half-abandoned 
lands that only require the application of reasonable 
agricultural methods to again become profitably pro- 
ductive. In the gradual change from the old condi- 
tion to that which exists at the present time various 
methods of cultivation have been proposed and more or 
less extensively followed. None have proved entirely 
satisfactory and the planters strongly feel the need 
for improvement. The plan in most general use is as 
follows: The ground is plowed and cross plowed 
with large turning plows drawn by three or four yoke 
of oxen. One man is required to hold the plow, an- 
other to drive the oxen, and usually a boy to lead the 
K
-P-A-G-E-144
      
   180 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
front yoke. Such an outfit plows but one third to one 
half an acre a day, which makes the work very expen- 
sive. Usually harrowing is not attempted. Plant- 
ing furrows are opened with the double moldboard 
plow and two short pieces of cane are dropped side by 
side at intervals of about three feet. The cane is 
covered with hoes. Planting is done either in the 
fall or spring, but fall planting is considered most 
profitable. During the first season cultivation is given 
with small plows or with Planet cultivators and with 
the hoe. After cutting the first crop the field is 
treated like new land. The trash remains asa mulch, 
but as the fields are now thoroughly infested with 
rank-growing grasses this is not sufficient to keep the 
land clear. No plowing is attempted on account of 
the trash, but the ground is all hoed over about three 
times in the course of the season. This is a heavy 
expense and still itdoes not prevent the grass from se- 
riously injuring the cane. The land in these old fields, 
too, becomes very hard and compact and after a few 
years the cane roots suffer from want of aération. It 
is no wonder, therefore, that these old land fields re- 
quire replanting so much quicker than new land 
where the soil is left loose and open by innumerable 
decaying tree roots. This system gives fairly good 
results for the first crop or so-called plant cane, though 
it could be improved by the better preparation of the 
land, the introduction of a leguminous crop before 
planting, and the intelligent use of commercial ferti- 
lizers. It fails badly with the successive crops of 
stubble cane and thus sacrifices the chief benefit to be 
derived from Cuba’s unusually favorable soil and
-P-A-G-E-145
SUGAR CANE 131 
climate, that of the production of many crops without 
the expense of replanting. Some planters advocate 
giving more space, and plant in hills six feet apart 
each way, as is usually done on the newlands. They 
then ctiltivate both ways the first season. Cane 
suckers or tillers so much during this long growing 
season that this plan secures a full crop on strong 
lands, but it has little or no advantage so far as the 
subsequent crops are concerned. In fact since a less 
portion of the land is occupied by cane there is a 
larger surface to be cleared by the hoe. Dr. Zayas, 
a well-known Havana physician, has for some years 
advocated a much wider planting, usually eight by 
twelve feet, and the continued use of cultivators 
drawn by animals. His writings contain many half 
truths, but his system has not proved a commercial 
success. 
The system recently advocated by the Cuban ex- 
periment station, while it has not yet stood the test 
of long-continued use, promises to solve satisfactorily 
the question of the continued production of profitable 
stubble crops. It is as follows: Plow the land in- 
tended for fall cane in the winter or spring. Plant 
to velvet beans in April or May. Plow these under 
with a disk plow in August and September. Harrow 
two or three times with the disk harrow. In October 
open deep planting furrows with the sulky double 
moldboard plow, spacing them about seven feet 
apart. Scatter tankage and potash or some similar 
complete fertilizer carrying about equal parts of 
nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash in the bottom of 
the furrow at the rate of five hundred pounds per acre. 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  182 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
This is best done with a two-horse fertilizer drill. A 
small cultivator shovel attached at the rear of the drill 
will serve to mix the fertilizer in the bottom of the 
furrow. Now drop a continuous row of seed cane in 
the bottom of the furrow. It is best to select plant 
cane or vigorous-growing stubble for seed. Using 
that from old, worn-out stubble fields is unadvisable, 
as it will make a weaker, less satisfactory growth. 
Cover with the disk cultivator, setting the gangs to 
throw more or less dirt according to the condition of 
moisture. If the ground is moist, germination will 
be prompter if the cane is not covered more than two 
or three inches. If it is dry, it is necessary to cover 
six or eight inches deep to prevent the drying of the 
seed canes. In from one to two weeks, or just as 
the first shoots are peeping through the ground, 
harrow the field thoroughly with the smoothing 
harrow, running lengthwise of the rows. This will 
kill any small weeds that may be starting and will 
freshen the surface of the soil and greatly aid 
germination. When the young plants are well 
up so that they show from one end of the row to the 
other, begin cultivating with the ordinary two-horse 
riding corn cultivator, of course straddling the row 
so as to cultivate both sides at once. The seven-foot 
rows are so wide that there will be a strip in the 
middle not reached by the cultivator. This can be 
finished with an ordinary walking cultivator of the 
Planet Jr. type, or the narrow cultivator blades may be 
removed from the regular cultivator and eight-inch 
cutaway sweeps be bolted on instead. These will have 
a wide enough cut to meet in the center and as thus
-P-A-G-E-147
  SUGAR CANE 133 
rigged the same implement makes a good middle cul- 
tivator. Cultivation should be repeated throughout 
the winter as often as isneeded to keep down all weeds 
and maintain a dust mulch. Before spring the 
growth of the cane will be so great that the row can 
no longer be straddled and the middles only can be 
cultivated. In April or the first of May sow cowpeas 
broadcast in the middles, cover them with the culti- 
vator, and the work is finished. Up to this point 
the plan does not differ materially from the ordinary 
system except that the use of the riding corn cultivator 
which works so close to the row makes it possible to 
almost completely dispense with the expensive hoe. 
It is only the few weeds and bunches of grass that 
come up directly in the row among the cane that 
have to be cut with the hoe or better still be pulled 
by hand. The line of cultivation thus outlined will 
leave the land practically level. This is right for 
the red lands since they have natural underdrainage, 
but in the wetter black lands it should be modified 
by using disk cultivators which ridge up the row as 
in Louisiana. 
As soon as the cane is cut, take an ordinary horse 
hayrake and drive so as to cross the cane rows, rak- 
ing the trash from one middle and dumping it in the 
next one. This quickly and cheaply clears half the 
ground so that it can be plowed and cultivated, and it 
provides a double mulch of trash for the other half 
which makes it so thick and heavy that practically 
no grass or weeds can come through, and these mid- 
dles will require no further attention for the season. 
Now plow the cleared middles with a two-horse
-P-A-G-E-148
  184 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
turning plow, throwing the dirt away from the cane. 
Run the last furrow up as close to the cane stubble 
as possible. You will not hurt the roots. They all 
died when the cane was cut, and new ones will form 
as the new shoots of cane begin to grow. If ferti- 
lizer is needed, it can now be applied in this open 
furrow next the cane. On most lands, however, it 
will only be necessary to use fertilizers every third 
or fourth year. Do not leave the furrow next the 
cane open any longer than is necessary, but work 
the dirt back with the cultivator, using some imple- 
ment that will throw a little dirt back over the 
stubble. Keep these alternate middles well culti- 
vated until the beginning of the rainy season and 
then sow them down to cowpeas. This will be 
found much cheaper than the ordinary plan of go- 
ing over all the surface of the ground two or three 
times with hoes, and it leaves the stubble cane in 
even better cultural condition than the plant cane, 
for one side of each row is thoroughly cultivated, 
while the other side is protected by a heavy mulch 
of trash, that serves perfectly to retain moisture. 
The next year, of course, the middles are reversed so 
that all the soil is thoroughly aérated, and pulverized 
every two years. And yet only half of it is exposed 
to the depleting influence of tillage, while all the 
trash is retained on the land and is ultimately in- 
corporated with it to add to its supply of humus, a 
substance so necessary for successful tropical agri- 
culture. Another great advantage of this system of 
promptly raking the trash and plowing alternate mid- 
dles is that each such plowed strip makes an efficient
-P-A-G-E-149
  SUGAR CANE 135 
fire break, and by properly spacing the early cuttings 
much can be done to safeguard the cane fields from 
fire, which is an enemy more dreaded than any other 
by the Cuban planter. As stated before, this sys- 
tem has not as yet been tested for a long term of 
years, but it is giving most excellent results, not 
only in decreasing cost but in increasing production, 
and it promises to do much to prolong the produc- 
tive life of the cane fields. It is the only system of 
cane cultivation that has ever satisfactorily solved 
the troublesome question of the proper and economi- 
cal disposition of the trash ; and it seems to promise 
that Cuba will continue to be in the future, as it 
long was in the past, the country of cheapest sugar 
production. 
Methods of Cultivation: Other American Coun- 
tries. —The sugar business is an old established 
industry in most of the other tropical American 
countries. In all of them, however, the tendency is 
to cling too closely to old methods of hand labor. 
Even in Porto Rico, where the business is now 
largely in the hands of American capitalists, work- 
men may be seen laboriously opening deep holes for 
planting cane with the hoe, and this, too, on lands 
that are perfectly adapted to the use of the best im- 
plements. The same dependence on the hoe or ma- 
chete is to be found in all of these other countries. 
This is not so much due to lack of knowledge on the 
part of the owners as it is to the supposed difficulty 
of teaching the native laborers the use of improved 
implements. This, it must be admitted, is often a 
difficult task; but that it is not impossible is shown
-P-A-G-E-150
  186 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
| 
by the results on those plantations where it has been 
most faithfully and intelligently tried, and. nothing 
is more certain than that those countries where the 
owners fail to teach their laborers this added effi- 
ciency will be inevitably forced out of the sugar busi- 
ness by the irresistible competition of those who 
succeed in so teaching them. 
Botanical Features and Varieties. — The flowers 
of sugar cane are produced in a long showy terminal 
panicle, somewhat as in the various sorghums. The 
flowers are perfect, and yet but few seeds are ordi- 
narily produced. In subtropical regions cane seldom 
flowers, and never produces seeds. It is propagated 
entirely from the buds which are produced at every 
joint on the stalk. The stalks are either laid down 
and covered with earth, or the tops are cut off and 
stuck in the ground as cuttings. In recent years, 
however, especially in some of the British West In- 
dian colonies, much attention has been given to 
planting the seed of sugar cane for the purpose of 
originating new varieties, hoping in this way to find 
some with a greater sugar content, or a greater 
resistance to disease than those now in general 
cultivation. Many thousands of seedling canes have 
been produced in Barbados and Demerara, and 
among them a few have been selected that seem 
quite superior, and are being planted on a consider- 
able scale. The great majority of the seedlings are, 
however, inferior to the parent varieties. 
Many quite distinct varieties exist in different 
parts of the world, and the problem of collecting 
them and testing them under local conditions is
-P-A-G-E-151
  SUGAR CANE 137 
everywhere receiving the attention of experimenters. 
Great confusion exists in regard to the names of these 
varieties, since the same kind has often received dif- 
ferent names in the various countries to which it has 
been introduced. This active comparative study of 
varieties, and the production of so many new ones, 
will, it is hoped, soon lead to an improvement in the 
average sugar content, as has been done in so marked 
a way by similar work with the sugar beet. Mean- 
while it is interesting to note that the industrious 
Dutch investigators in Java have recently conclu- 
sively demonstrated the complete practicability of 
largely and permanently increasing the sugar con- 
tent by the chemical selection of the best strains 
found in existing varieties. The practical impor- 
tance of this discovery is greatly enhanced by the 
fact that increased richness in the juice seems to be 
correlated with large size and vigor in the cane. 
This fact seems to have been proven by long-con- 
tinued and extensive breeding experiments. If it 
shall be confirmed by further experimentation in 
other countries, it will prove a discovery of the 
utmost practical importance, since by simply per- 
sistently selecting the most vigorous, heaviest canes 
for planting, year after year, we will not only de- 
velop a strain yielding a greater tonnage, but one 
yielding a considerably richer juice as well. The 
importance of a careful selection of seed cane is a 
question that has been grossly neglected in most cane- 
growing countries. 
Diseases and Insects. —'Phe cane borer (Diatrea 
saccharalis Fabr.) is a lepidopterous larva that is 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    | | | 
188 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
| 
rather widely distributed in Chobe koeriag| countries. 
It bores into the stalks, forming irregular galleries. 
It also attacks corn and some of the other large 
grasses. When sufficiently abundant, it is capable 
of doing serious injury, but for the most part it 
seems to be kept in control by natural enemies. 
The principal remedy, when one is needed, consists 
in burning the trash as soon as the cane is harvested. 
A mealy-bug is frequently found abundantly on 
sugar cane. It lurks under the loosely fitting leaf 
sheaths, and undoubtedly causes considerable in- 
jury from sucking the juice. It has not, however, 
attracted much attention, and no remedial measures 
have been proposed. 
One of the army worms (Heliophila unipuncta 
Haworth) sometimes causes damage in Cuba by 
eating the leaves from the young canes, It is not 
often very troublesome, and no remedies have been 
tried. Dusting with Paris green and the use of 
poisoned baits, as for cutworms, could be resorted 
to if necessary. 
The sugar-cane leaf hopper (Perkinsiella saccha- 
ricida Kirkaldy) was accidentally introduced into 
the Hawaiian Islands some years ago from Australia, 
with some varieties of seed canes that were brought 
in for experimental purposes. Being free from the 
presence of the native insect enemies that have 
always kept it under control in Australia, it multi- 
plied with great rapidity, and for a time threatened 
serious injury to the sugar industry. The experi- 
ment-station entomologists, however, succeeded in 
importing successfully some of its Australian insect
-P-A-G-E-153
SUGAR CANE 139 
parasites. They, in turn, are now multiplying 
rapidly, and it seems probable that they will succeed 
in checking the increase of the leaf hoppers. 
In Barbados and some of the other Lesser Antilles 
much loss has been occasioned by a root rot of the 
cane caused by a minute parasitic mushroom (Maras- 
mius sacchari Wakker). What is supposed to be 
the same disease has also recently been reported 
from Hawaii. Some of the new seedling varieties 
of cane seem to have considerable immunity to this 
disease and their use is recommended for these in- 
fected regions. 
In Cuba the Marasmius disease has not been 
detected, but a similar root rot is caused by an 
undescribed species of Peniophora. This fungus is 
normally a saprophite that forms mats of white 
mycelium in the old leaf sheaths near the ground 
and on the old dead stubble. Under some conditions, 
however, it invades the living tissues, killing the 
base of the stalks and the roots. It has notattracted 
much attention and no remedies have been tried, but 
it occurs very abundantly and is doubtless one of 
the principal causes for the dying out of the old cane 
fields. 
A bacterial top rot of the cane also occurs in 
Cuba. Whether it is the same as the one that has 
been studied in Java has not been determined. It 
involves the soft tissues surrounding the terminal 
bud, which it soon kills, thus causing the death and 
drying up of the whole cane. It occurs very com- 
monly in old fields that are in bad condition. It is 
known locally as the “drying” of the cane and it

140 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
annually causes very considerable losses. It is 
usually the determining factor that necessitates the 
plowing up and replanting of the old fields. For- 
tunately vigorous, rapidly growing canes have great 
powers of resistance to this disease and are very 
seldom attacked. The intelligent use of fertilizers 
and cultivation may be depended on as an absolute 
specific for it. 
The rind disease (Melanconium sacchari Wakker) 
is everywhere present in cane fields. It is easily 
recognized by the black horn-shaped masses of spores 
that protrude from little pustules under the cortex 
and conspicuously roughen and blacken the infected 
areas. The fungus is normally a saprophite, living 
on the dead cane tissues, and it cannot unaided 
penetrate the epidermis of the healthy cane. When- 
ever this is wounded, however, by any cause, it is able 
to gain an entrance, and it often causes great damage 
in connection with or as a secondary effect from 
some of the insects and diseases mentioned above. 
This is particularly true of the leaf-hopper injuries in 
Hawaii and the top-rot disease in Cuba, Canes 
infested by the latter are quickly invaded by the 
rind disease also. 
The dreaded Surah disease of Java has not yet 
been found in America. The greatest care should 
be observed in importing canes from the East for 
experimental purposes lest this or other serious 
pests be imported with them. This danger is well 
illustrated by the case of the leaf hopper in Hawaii. 
In fact it is so great that the transportation of cane 
from one country to another should be strictly pro-

ef 
hibited by law except when it is done by propefl 
accredited government experiment stations, where all 
possible precautions can be taken and where the 
growing cane can be constantly under the observa- 
tion of experts. 
THE GRAINS 
Corn (Zea Mays L.) 
For the region that it is intended to cover by this 
work, corn must be regarded, taking everything into 
consideration, as the one most important crop, not- 
withstanding the fact that the corn belt proper is 
not included in our limits. Few cultivated plants 
have as wide a range of distribution and few equal it 
in the number of uses to which it is put in the world’s 
industries and in local utility on the farm. It is the 
greatest gift that the new world has given to the old. 
Although a native of warm climates it can be grown 
successfully as far north as southern Canada and in 
fact in practically all temperate and tropical regions 
where there is sufficient rainfall for three or four 
months in the year. Very dry air prevents proper 
pollination, so that it does not succeed well as a rule 
in regions entirely dependent on irrigation. 
Climate and Soil.— Corn requires a period of 
at least three months of continued warm weather 
with warm nights and frequent though not excessive 
rains. (It will grow on almost any well-drained soil 
that can be put in good mechanical condition. It 
thrives best on deep loamy soils that contain a mixture 
of both sand and clay combined with a large amount  
-P-A-G-E-156
  142 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL nos 
of vegetable matter. Well-drained alluvial soils along 
streams and the rich black prairies of the middle West 
are exactly suited to its requirements. No crop 
responds more readily to the use of fertilizers and 
improved methods of preparation and cultivation, and 
on the other hand none will endure more abuse and 
neglect without inviting absolute failure. 
Manuring.— Corn is a gross feeder and can 
utilize manurial substances in almost any form. An 
abundance of vegetable matier is a necessity for the 
production of maximum crops. Of the three elements 
usually bought in fertilizers, nitrogen is doubtless 
the most important and it is the one that is usually 
soonest exhausted under continued cropping. In the 
South, however, with the system of cultivation de- 
tailed below, this need never be purchased, but can 
be grown on the ground by means of a leguminous 
cover crop. This is one of the greatest advantages 
coming from the longer growing season at the South. 
The vigorous growth of the stalk depends very 
largely on the presence of sufficient nitrogen. 
Phosphoric acid is, however, almost equally impor- 
tant, for without it there will be a scanty production 
of grain. This cannot be produced on the farm, but 
must be purchased. In most parts of the South it 
can be secured cheapest in the form of acid phosphate, 
which is a ground phosphatic rock that has been 
treated with sulphuric acid to make it more soluble. 
The use of two hundred to three hundred pounds per 
acre of this substance will prove profitable on nearly 
all Southern corn lands that have been long in culti- 
vation. On the pine lands it is indispensable from
-P-A-G-E-157
THE GRAINS 148 
the first, since these soils are exceedingly deficient in 
phosphoric acid. 
The need for potash is in most cases less evident. 
Most Southern soils contain enough of this substance 
for the present need of the corn crop and it should 
only be applied when the need for it has been dem- 
onstrated by actual experiment. For corn the mu- 
riate of potash will answer as well as the more 
expensive sulphate. 
Corn endures a certain amount of acidity in the 
soil with very little harm. It is seldom, therefore, 
that liming is necessary for this crop. 
Methods of Planting and Cultivating.—In the 
Northern corn belt planting is mostly done with two- 
horse check-row planters. These implements drop 
two rows at a time, and by an ingenious device the 
hills are so spaced that they will row in both direc- 
tions, thus allowing cross cultivation. The distance 
between hills is usually.about three and a half feet, 
though this varies in different localities. Before 
planting, the ground is plowed and thoroughly har- 
rowed. If the land was in corn the season previous, 
an implement known as a stalk cutter is run in ad- 
vance of plowing, which cuts the stalks up in short sec- 
tions so that they will not interfere with plows and 
cultivators.. Assoonas the corn is above ground or 
even earlier, if there has been a rain to pack the sur- 
face, a smoothing harrow is passed over the field with 
the teeth set at a considerable angle, so that they may 
not tear out the young plants. These, being slightly 
below the surface in the planter furrow, are seldom 
injured, but the surface of the ground is stirred and   
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  144 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
mellowed and young weeds are destroyed. As soon 
as the corn is five or six inches high the use of the 
two-horse cultivator is begun. This straddles the 
row, cultivating both sides at once. The cultiva- 
tors are now kept running constantly, first in one 
direction and then in the other, until the corn is so 
high that it can be no longer straddled without in- 
jury. By this timeit shades the ground so completely 
that no further work is necessary. This system is 
perfectly applicable in the South, and all lands that 
have good drainage, and yet that are level enough to 
admit of cultivation in both directions without danger 
of loss from washing, might well be planted in this 
way. Cowpeas, at the rate of three to six pecks per 
acre, should, however, be broadcasted among the corn, 
just in advance of the last cultivation, or a continuous 
row may be planted in each middle with a one-horse 
cotton or corn planter. 
On very wet lands like the Louisiana sugar lands 
it is necessary to plant the corn on elevated beds, as 
has been described for sugar-cane planting. This 
does not admit of cross cultivation and the two-row 
planter cannot be used. It is usual to give rather 
more space between the rows, usually four and a half 
to five feet, and to plant with a one-row planter ar- 
ranged to drop one to two seeds every twelve to 
eighteen inches. This gives almost as many stalks 
per acre, and the greater width between the rows 
allows a better opportunity for the growth of the 
cowpeas. On such lands peas should be broadcasted, 
as they will not thrive if planted in the water furrow. 
On most of the Southern uplands the surface is so
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE GRAINS 145 
rolling that terracing or circling the rows (planting 
on contour lines) is necessary to avoid serious loss 
from washing. This, of course, also makes cross cul- 
tivation and the use of the check-row planter impos- 
sible. On these light hill lands it is also found best 
to space the rows about five feet apart, but to drill in 
the cowpeas in a single row in the middles. This 
makes it possible to cultivate once or twice after the 
peas are planted, which is a great advantage, since 
maintaining a dust mulch as late in the season as 
possible is of the utmost importance on these lands, 
which otherwise suffer so quickly from short periods 
of drought. 
  A Lister Corn Planter. 
In the drier regions west of the Mississippi River 
the system of listing corn, that is, of planting it in 
the bottom of deep water furrows, has come to be 
widely adopted. ‘This is exactly the reverse of the 
Louisiana system, where it is planted on top of the 
beds. The land is either first broken flat with a 
common plow and then planting furrows opened with 
the double moldboard plow or, if the soil is of friable 
texture, the planting furrows are opened between the 
old rows without previous plowing. Lister planters 
L
-P-A-G-E-160
146 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
are now in use that open the furrow and plant the 
seed at one operation. Special narrow cultivators 
have also been devised that work in the sides of these 
deep lister furrows, gradually filling them as the 
plant grows, so that when laid by, the land is left 
nearly level. This system is excellent for the special 
conditions where it has been developed and it might 
be profitably used much more widely, especially in 
tropical countries during the dry season. It would 
be admirably adapted to such soils as the Cuban red 
lands that have such remarkable natural drainage. 
Not so many years ago corn was all planted by 
hand. The farmer opened a shallow furrow with 
the plow, girls and small boys dropped the seed, 
and it was covered with hoes. When the grass and 
weeds got high enough to be in danger of hiding the 
row, it was “barred off” by running a one-horse 
turning plow with the bar to the row, thus piling up 
the dirt in the middles. The row was next cleared 
with the hoe, and two or three weeks later it was “laid 
by ” by plowing the dirt back to the row and ridging 
it up as much as possible. This would now be consid- 
ered barbarous treatment, and it is no longer seen 
except in some modified form on rough new stump 
lands where no other method is possible, and yet such 
is the natural vigor and bounty of the corn plant that 
our fathers and grandfathers usually contrived to 
keep full corn cribs before check-row planters and 
two-horse cultivators were even dreamed of. The once 
almost universal custom of “barring off” the young 
corn is now considered under ordinary circumstances 
to be quite harmful, since it unduly exposes the soil 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE GRAINS 147 
near the roots of the plant to the drying action of 
wind and sun. There are times, however, when a 
newly planted field has been deluged by long-continued 
cold rains, that this old treatment is clearly indicated 
as the best means of warming and drying the soil. 
The furrows should be filled, however, as soon as this 
purpose has been accomplished. 
Harvesting. —In the corn belt proper on those 
farms where this is the principal money crop it is 
usually only the grain which is utilized, the stalks 
and leaves being allowed to go to waste in the field. 
When the corn is fully dry, wagons are driven into 
the field; the ears are husked by hand as they stand 
on the stalks and are thrown in the wagon. When 
this is full, it is driven to the cribs where the ears 
are temporarily stored or direct to the corn sheller. 
When shelled, the corn is shipped in bulk to eleva- 
tors, where it is stored, or it may be sacked for retail 
shipment. 
In the South corn is usually only grown as a sub- 
sidiary crop for home use in the feeding of animals. 
Since the stalks and leaves if properly harvested 
contain, roughly speaking, as much stock food as the 
ears, it becomes a matter of considerable importance 
to see that they are properly utilized. It is a com- 
mon practice in many parts of the South to strip the 
leaves from the stalks at the time that the corn is 
beginning to harden. These “blades,” as they are 
called, are tied in bundles and, when dry, are carefully 
housed and make most excellent feed for horses and 
mules. They are a great resource for the small 
farmer of the South. Stripping the blades requires
-P-A-G-E-162
  148 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
a considerable amount of expensive hand labor, and 
careful experiments show that the practice reduces 
the yield of grain from two to three bushels per acre. 
Sometimes also the tops above the ear are cut and 
shocked until dry. The Northern practice of cutting 
and shocking the entire stalk, afterwards shucking 
out the ears and utilizing the stover as fodder for 
cattle, is but little practiced at the South. This is 
perhaps partly on account of the heavy winter rains 
which injure the shocked corn and fodder, but the 
falls at the South are usually dry enough so that a 
large amount of the crop could be utilized in this 
manner. The silo for preserving green corn fodder 
is but little used at the South. 
All of these methods, however, require a consider- 
able amount of laborious and expensive hand labor. 
With the perfection of modern machinery it is now 
possible to avoid this and to handle a corn crop very 
economically and so as to secure from it the fullest 
possible food value. The crop is allowed to get a 
little more mature than is usual for cutting and 
shocking. It is then cut with a corn harvester which 
ties the stalks in small bundles. These are set up 
into shocks to cure, and when thoroughly dry they 
are hauled to the barn and are run through a shredder. 
This machine slits the stalks up lengthwise into thin 
shreds, in which condition the entire stalk is readily 
eaten by cattle. At the same time the ear is snapped 
off by the machine and is husked and shelled, the - 
cobs coming out of one opening and the shelled grain 
at another. This almost entirely does away with 
hand labor in harvesting and storing the corn crop,
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE GRAINS 149 
and it makes the entire plant, with the exception of 
the cob, immediately available for stock food. 
Chief Uses. — The chief use of corn is unquestion- 
ably as food for domestic animals and, as we have 
just seen, the entire plant may be utilized in this 
way. The grain is also an important article of 
human food. It is used in the arts for the manu- 
facture of starch, of glucose, of oil, and in the prepa- 
ration of fermented and distilled liquors. 
Botanical Features and Varieties. — Corn, like sugar 
cane, belongs to the great grass family. It bears 
staminate flowers on a terminal panicle called the 
tassel, while the pistillate flowers are borne in one 
or more compact axillary spikes called ears, each of 
which is covered with a number of closely appressed 
bracts, the husks. The corn silk consists of the 
greatly elongated stigmas, one of which runs down 
to each kernel. The pollen from the tassel falls on 
these hairlike stigmas and the pollen tube grows 
down to and fecundates the egg cell located in the 
immature grain. 
The number of recognized varieties is very great, 
but they may be grouped under a comparatively few 
races. The principal of these are the dent corns, 
the flint corns, the sweet corns, the flour. corns, or 
horse-tooth corns as they are sometimes called, and 
the pop corns. The dent corns are by far the most 
important and constitute the great bulk of the corn 
of commerce. There are many varieties, white, 
yellow, or red in color. The most typical varieties 
have white grain and white cobs. The flint corns, as 
a rule, have a shorter growing season than the dent
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
varieties, and hence can be grown somewhat farther 
north. They are extensively grown in New England 
and Canada. Some of the varieties are also very 
hardy under tropical conditions. The ordinary dent 
corns fail entirely when planted in Cuba, but the 
native corn, which is a yellow flint variety, thrives 
and yields fair crops. The flint corns are usually 
yellow, though white and bluish varieties also occur. 
The flour or horse-tooth corns are mostly grown in the 
\ uplands of Mexico. They have very large soft white 
kernels that are easily beaten into meal in the rude 
native mortars. They are grown somewhat in the 
_ Southern states, especially for fodder, but they have 
little commercial importance. Coming from the 
Mexican uplands, they thrive no better in Cuba than 
the Northern dent corns. The sweet corns so univer- 
sally planted at the North for table use and for can- 
ning are comparatively little known at the South. 
They can be grown successfully in all parts of the 
Southern states and should be much more widely 
planted, as they are so superior for the table. The 
fodder, too, is greatly relished by cattle and horses. 
Unfortunately they cannot be grown in Cuba. The 
pop corns are of comparatively little importance and 
yet they can hardly be omitted from the household 
resources. 
During recent years notable progress has been 
made in improving varieties of corn. Not only have 
strains been developed that. give largely increased 
yields, but very notable success has been achieved in 
selecting strains that are especially adapted for 
different purposes. It has been demonstrated that 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
THE GRAINS 151 
by careful selection it is perfectly possible to secure 
strains in which the kernels run much higher than 
the average in either starch, protein, or oil, thus 
adapting the grain much better to the different 
purposes for which it is used. For starch, glucose, 
and distilled liquors a high starch content is de- 
sirable. For feeding purposes a high protein con- 
tent is best, and for the manufacture of corn oil a 
high oil content is, of course, desired. We are 
only just beginning to realize how plastic most of 
our more familiar farm crops are and how possible it 
is to greatly improve them in almost any desired 
direction simply by careful attention to the selection 
of the seed. 
“ Diseases and Insects. —Corn is subject to a con- 
siderable number of diseases, but the smut is the 
only one of sufficient importance to be considered 
here. The unsightly black spore masses of this fun- 
gus ‘are familiar objects in every cornfield. It may 
attack almost any part of the plant, but it is usually 
found involving the ears and it is only here that any 
serious damage is done. The number of smutted 
ears varies greatly in different fields and in different 
seasons, but it seldom exceeds two or three per cent. 
Even this small percentage represents in the aggre- 
gate an enormous loss. Corn smut cannot be con- 
trolled by treating the seed, as is the case with the 
various smuts of the small grains. The only known 
remedy is to hand pick and destroy the young 
pustules before they burst and scatter the multitude 
of black dustlike spores. Even this will not prove 
an entire preventive, since these spores are so light 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
   
   152 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
that they can easily be carried long distances by the 
wind, 
The number of insects seriously attacking corn is 
very great, so many, in fact, that a full discussion 
of them cannot be attempted in a general work of 
this kind. The reader is referred to the comprehen- 
sive work on corn insects recently issued by Pro- 
fessor 8. A. Forbs, entomologist of the Illinois 
Experiment Station. 4 
Rice (Oryza sativa Linn.) 
In the Oriental countries rice occupies the same 
commanding agricultural position that wheat and 
corn do with us. It has long been grown to some 
extent in certain parts of South Carolina and Louisi- 
ana. During recent years it has come to be very 
largely planted on the low plains of western Louisi- 
ana and eastern Texas. It is also grown in a small 
way in all parts of tropical America, but aside from 
the regions just mentioned its cultivation has not 
received the attention which the importance of the 
crop deserves. 
Rice is very largely used in the Southern states, 
and especially in Cuba and the other West India 
islands. Large areas of lands suitable for its cul- 
ture are to be found in these islands, but so little 
attention is paid to this crop that by far the greater 
part of the rice consumed is imported. 
Chief Uses. The chief use of rice is for human 
food. In preparing the grain for market two by- 
products are secured, known as rice bran and rice 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
    
THE GRAINS 153 
polish ; these are extensively used for feeding hogs 
and cattle. 
Upland rice, a variety adapted to dry soils, is 
grown on a small scale for local use throughout the 
Gulf states. This is often cut before fully mature, 
and is bundled and cured the same as oats. It is 
fully equal to sheaf oats for feeding horses. No 
other food puts them in better condition or gives 
them a glossier coat. 
Climate and Soil. — Rice is a crop of warm coun- 
tries, although there are varieties that are grown 
successfully in northern Japan. The crop requires 
abundance of heat and moisture. Most of the kinds 
require irrigation. The plant is semiaquatic and 
will endure flooding for considerable periods. The 
best rice soils are rather stiff clay, containing plenty 
of vegetable matter. Reclaimed swamps and marshes 
are usually adapted to rice. The upland kind before 
mentioned will grow on any soil suitable for corn or 
cotton. 
Manuring. — As a rule but little attention is paid 
to manuring rice lands. Applications of phosphoric 
acid would, however, in many cases be profitable, 
owing to the increased yield of grain. 
The small farmers of the pine-wood regions of 
the South usually plant their upland rice on cow- 
penned land. 
Methods of Planting and Cultivation. — In Eastern 
countries rice is planted in seed beds, and the young 
plants, when several inches high, are transplanted

to their knees in performing the operation. This

method would be far too costly with our high-priced 
Western labor. 
The rapid extension of rice growing in Texas and 
Louisiana has been due to the discovery that on these 
soils it is possible to plant and harvest rice by 
machinery in exactly the same way that wheat and 
other small grains are handled at the North. Fields 
are arranged with a system of dikes and ditches so 
that they may be flooded at will. The land is plowed 
and harrowed the same as for any other grain crop, 
and seed planted with a grain drill. 
If the ground is moist enough to insure germination, 
no irrigation is given until the plants are several 
inches high; then the fields are flooded and the water 
allowed to remain long enough to kill the young 
weeds and grass. The water is then drawn off and 
applied again at intervals as needed. As the grain 
matures the fields are thoroughly drained in order 
to admit of the use of self-binders for harvesting 
the crop. 
The grain is thrashed in the same manner as wheat 
or oats, but as the chaff adheres very closely to the 
kernel, this rough rice, or paddy, has to go through a 
milling process before being ready for market. 
The upland rice, grown in small quantities by so 
many Southern farmers, is not irrigated and conse- 
quently must be cultivated two or three times in 
order to keep down grass and weeds. It is usually 
planted in drills about twenty to twenty-four inches 
apart, which is sufficient space to allow for cultivation 
with a single shovel plow.

other grains belongs to the great grass family. The 
seeds are borne in a terminal panicle in much the 
same manner as oats. Comparatively few varieties 
have been grown in the United States, but in Japan 
and other Eastern countries a great number are rec- 
ognized. The Honduras rice, formerly so largely 
grown in Louisiana and Texas, had a soft kernel 
which broke badly in milling, thus occasioning con- 
siderable loss. Through the efforts of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture a superior kind has been 
imported from Japan, which has a grain hard enough 
to resist the milling machinery, and the loss from 
broken grains is thus avoided. 
Diseases and Insects. —So far rice has been com- 
paratively free from troubles of this kind. A few 
years ago a rice smut was imported into South Caro- 
lina from Japan, but has only been locally trouble- 
some. Such other troubles as occur have attracted 
but. little attention and have not been exhaustively 
studied. 
Oats (Avena sativa Linn.) 
Oats are grown with more or less success in all 
parts of the Southern states, and can even be grown, 
as a winter crop, on some soils in Cuba. They do 
best at the South when planted in the fall, although 
they are occasionally injured by exceptionally severe 
winters. Fall-planted oats may be pastured through- 
out the winter, when the ground is not too soft, and 
will still make a fair crop of grain, though yields at 
the South are never as large as at the North. In fact 
they are usually planted quite as much for the pas-  
-P-A-G-E-170
  156 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
turage they afford as for the grain. Oats have been 
quite widely recommended as forming a part in a 
well-considered rotation for the upland cotton farmer. 
The rotation generally suggested is cotton followed 
by corn with cowpeas between the rows; these are 
plowed under in the fall and the land is immediately 
seeded to oats. After the oats are harvested cow- 
peas are again planted, to be followed by the cotton 
the next spring. The variety known as Texas rust- 
proof oats is most widely planted at the South, and 
the turf or grazing oat is also popular. 
Rye (Secale cereale Linn.) 
Rye is considerably sown at the South for winter 
grazing, for winter cover crops in orchards, and 
other similar purposes. Best results are usually ob- 
tained with home-grown seed. There are certain 
strains which have been long grown in the South 
that give better results than Northern seed. In 
Cuba much better results were had with Florida seed 
than with that grown even as far north as Georgia. 
Rye is a crop of minor importance at the South, and 
should perhaps be included among the forages rather 
than the grains. The practice of planting it for a 
winter cover is to be commended, since it is quite 
effective in presérving the soil from the damage 
caused by the heavy rains. When plowed under in 
the spring, it rots quickly and serves to add a cer- 
tain mye of much-needed humus to the soil. 
Millets and Sorghums 
A number of kinds of millets“Are widely grown as 
subsidiary crops in the Southern states. They also
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE GRAINS 157 
should be classed as forage plants, since, as a rule, 
they are utilized fully as much for green forage as 
for the grain. 
German millet (Setaria Italica Germanica) is sown 
as a hay crop in the more northerly portions of the 
Southern states; it is seldom seen in the lighter soils 
of the Gulf region. 
The pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoideum) is often 
planted in small patches for use as a soiling crop. 
When cut, this suckers from the roots and yields 
successive cuttings. 
A number of different sorghums are considerably 
grown in all parts of the South and also in Cuba and 
other tropical countries. In the drier regions of the 
Southwest they replace corn, and constitute the 
principal grain and forage crops. 
The sorghums are usually grown in drills, three or 
four feet apart, and are given much the same culti- 
vation as corn. Sometimes, however, the seed is sown 
broadcast and the crop is cut and harvested like hay. 
Some varieties sucker from the roots when cut and 
thus give two or more crops from a single planting. 
The sorghums may be roughly divided into two 
classes, the saccharine and non-saccharine. Besides 
their use as a forage, the stalks of the former yield a 
sweet juice which is used for making a table syrup in 
those regions where sugar cane cannot be successfully 
grown. Persistent efforts were formerly made to 
manufacture sugar from sorghum; the juice con- 
tains sufficient sucrose, but also contains impurities 
which prevent free crystallization, and these attempts 
have not been commercially successful. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  158 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
The early amber and early orange are two of the 
best of the saccharine varieties. The non-saccharine 
sorghums are usually grown as grain crops, though 
they are also used as green forage. Milo maize and 
Kaffir corn are two of the best varieties. They are 
now extensively grown in the dry regions of the 
Southwest, on lands that were formerly considered‘ 
only fit for grazing purposes. The yield of grain is 
quite large, and it proves to be nearly equal to corn 
for feeding all kinds of domestic animals. It is 
especially valuable for poultry. 
PAsTURE AND Forage Crops 
A much larger number of pasture and forage 
plants are available at the South than are familiar to 
the Northern farmer. This, together with the mild 
climate and long grazing season, makes this region, as 
a whole, particularly well adapted to the raising of 
cattle and other domestic animals. Curiously enough, 
however, there are few parts of the South where 
this industry has received the attention which it 
merits. Trainloads of beef, butter, cheese, lard, 
and bacon are constantly moving southward from 
the North and West to supply people who could 
raise these commodities cheaper than those from - 
whom they buy them. 
For the enterprising stockman almost all parts 
of the South present an inviting field. Among 
the many available forage and pasture plants only 
the most important will be briefly noted. 
Crab Grass (Panicum sanguinale).— This grass 
springs up as a weed in cultivated fields; in fact, it is
-P-A-G-E-173
  PASTURE AND FORAGE CROPS 159 
one of the worst weeds that the Southern farmer has 
to contend with. 
At the same time 
it is one of the most 
valuable grasses 
for hay and pas- 
ture. When corn 
or other similar 
crops are laid by in 
most parts of the 
South, this grass 
quickly springs up 
and occupies the 
land for the re- 
mainder of the sea- 
son. If the corn 
is cut and shocked, 
the crab grass can, 
a little later, be 
cut for hay. It 
cures easily, and if 
cut before over- 
ripe and properly 
cured, it makes a ~ 
hay of which stock 
of all kinds are 
very fond, and 
which seems to be 
nearly or quite 
equal to timothy 
in feeding value.   It is greatly relished by stock when fresh, and it is a

160 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
common practice to utilize the cornfields for fall 
| pasturage. 
Bermuda Grass (Cynodon Dactylon).— This is pre- 
eminently the best Southern grass for permanent pas- 
tures. It thrives on all kinds of soil and stands the 
closest grazing without injury. It is very nutritious 
{ | and is greatly relished by stock of 
os | all kinds. An acre of Bermuda 
\\ grass on good land in any of the 
Gulf states will, on account of the 
longer growing season, furnish 
more pasturage than the best acre 
in the famous bluegrass regions 
of Kentucky. The one drawback 
to its more general use is that it 
is very difficult to exterminate 
and becomes a serious pest when 
the land is brought under culti- 
vation. 
It is practically the only suit- 
able grass in the South for lawns, 
as it covers the ground quickly, 
and if well enriched and kept 
closely clipped will make a beautiful sod in a very 
few months’ time. On thin lands it does not grow 
tall enough to yield profitable cuttings for hay, but 
on rich lands it will yield a ton or more of very 
nutritious hay at each cutting, and can be cut as 
many as three times in the course of the season. 
Bermuda grass occurs in all the West India 
Islands and in the other American tropics. Its 
value as a pasture grass in those regions has been 
  Bermuda Grass.
-P-A-G-E-175
PASTURE AND FORAGE CROPS 161 
largely overlooked, owing to the ranker growing 
Guinea and Para grasses, which are there so abun- 
dant. Bermuda grass is sometimes grown from seed, 
but the vitality of the seed is not always good, and 
a stand is often hard to secure in this way. Itisa 
much more certain method to plant bits of sod. 
These small pieces are dropped into every other fur- 
row, when the land is plowed. After plowing the 
land is smoothed with the harrow, and unless the 
weather is unusually dry a perfect stand will be se- 
cured. The tufts of grass which spring from these 
pieces of sod soon spread and completely cover the 
ground. 
Johnson Grass (Sorghum Halepense). —'This coarse- 
growing grass was introduced into the South many 
years ago as a forage plant. It 
has proved to be a pernicious 
weed. It spreads by fleshy 
underground stems, which can- 
not be killed by any ordinary 
cultivation and which are easily 
carried to different parts of the 
field by plows and cultivators. 
It grows so rapidly that it 
quickly smothers crops, and 
when present in a field neces- 
sitates double the usual amount 
of cultivation. 
There are large areas in cen- 
tral Alabama and Mississippi 
where cotton growing has been 
given up on account of the presence of this pest. It is

so troublesome ond dangerous a plant that its planting 
for forage is never justifiable. Those planters who, 
however, are unfortunate enough to have it find 
that it makes a fairly good though coarse hay, and 
Guinea Grass. 
  the abandoned fields before men- 
tioned have been converted into 
hay farms. The yield of hay is 
large at each cutting, and it gives 
a number of cuttings in the 
season. 
As a pasture grass it is not 
desirable. Cattle and horses do 
¥ not relish it when green, but 
learn to eat it in the absence of 
better grasses. It does not stand 
tramping well and if heavily pas- 
tured will soon run out, though 
\ unfortunately it can never be 
|| exterminated in this way. On 
plowing the field it springs up 
again, as strong and rank as ever. 
This grass occurs as a great 
pest in most tropical countries. 
Guinea Grass (Panicum mavzi- 
mum). — This is the best of the 
tropical forage grasses. It grows 
as rapidly and is as rank and 
coarse as Johnson grass, but is 
very nutritious, and stock of all kinds eat it 
greedily. It requires a rich and rather heavy but 
well-@rained soil. Under these favorable condi- 
* tions it grows six or eight feet high and yields an 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  PASTURE AND FORAGE CROPS nee 
/¢ 
enormous quantity of forage. It forms large stools 
or tussocks, and stands grazing perfectly. The 
famous grazing lands of central and eastern Cuba 
and western Jamaica are largely set to this grass. 
It grows much more rapidly during the rainy season, 
but furnishes considerable pasturage throughout the 
year. It is estimated that from one and a half to 
two acres of good Guinea grass pasture will support 
an animal the year round. Guinea grass does not 
stand much freezing, so in the United States it can 
only be grown in Florida and along the Gulf coast. 
It is propagated either by seed or by sets made by 
division of the large stools. 
When the land is required for cultivated crops, its 
manner of growth makes plowing 
difficult; but when the sod is 
once turned over it soon dies and 
gives no further trouble. 
Para Grass (Panicum molle).— 
This grass.is also known as Paral, 
Parana, Panama, and various 
other local names. It is a native 
of South America, but is now 
found widely distributed. It 
equals or exceeds Guinea grass 
in rapidity of growth, but instead 
of growing in stools sends out at 
long, half-prostrate stems that 
root at the joints, forming a 
dense, tangled mass, with free, 
erect ends which reach a height Para Grass! 
of four to six feet. It grows in moister land

  than Guinea |givhady and will endure submergence for 
quite long periods. It is eaten greedily by stock and 
yields an immense amount of pasturage, especially 
on wet, swampy lands. When the land is plowed, 
each buried stalk grows, sending up new shoots from 
the joints like a gigantic quack grass. This makes 
it very difficult to subdue, though it can be killed by 
repeated plowing during dry weather. It was intro- 
duced into Caba as a pasture grass, but has become a 
great scourge in the cane fields, especially on the low, 
black lands. Like Guinea grass it does not endure 
cold. | 
Water Grass (Paspalum dilatatum).— This is a 
native of the Southern states. It forms clumps, 
yp usually in creek bottoms and 
/ other wet places, but will 
grow well on any ordinary 
farm land. It is much rel- 
ished by live stock and fur- 
nishes a large amount of 
pasturage for a very long 
season. 
It grows tall enough to 
make a large yield when 
cut for hay. It is one of the 
most valuable of the native 
Southern - grasses, and de- 
serves to be much more 
g widely planted. It is some-

Carpet Grass (Paspalum compressum). — This   
-P-A-G-E-179
  
PASTURE AND FORAGE CROPS 165 
also is a native of the Southern states, where it is 
mostly confined to moist, sandy lands. It is a low 
creeping grass which forms a dense sod when heavily 
pastured. Carpet grass and Bermuda grass are the 
only two grasses that serve for permanent pastures 
on light, sandy soils in the Gulf states. It seeds 
freely, but is seldom or never planted, coming in of 
its own accord where land is so heavily pastured as 
to kill out other vegetation. It stays green through- 
out the winter and furnishes grazing for twelve 
months in the year. It does not grow high enough 
to cut for hay. 
Mexican Clover (Richardsonia scabra).— This plant 
has no right to the name of clover; it is an annual 
weed of cultivated fields, belonging to the Madder 
family, the Rubiacee. It is a native of tropical 
America, but is now widely introduced throughout the 
Gulf states. Like crab grass it comes up in the fields 
after the crops are laid by and affords good grazing 
or yields a heavy cutting of nutritious hay. It is 
usually found only on light, sandy soils. 
Japan Clover (Lespedeza striata). — This plant 
was introduced into the Southern states during the 
Civil War, presumably in forage. It is now abun- 
dant throughout the South, and extends as far north 
as southern Illinois. It is a low-growing, prostrate 
annual, coming up late in the spring along roadsides 
and in pastures and waste places. It is eagerly eaten 
by live stock, and for two or three months furnishes 
abundance of nutritious pasturage even on lands too 
‘poor and dry to support the ordinary pasture grasses. 
On richer lands it grows to a height of one to two
-P-A-G-E-180
  166 THE CHIEF one AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
feet and is often cut for hay. While not a true 
clover, it is a closely related legume and its roots sup- 
port a great number of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, 
i making it a useful 
plant for soil renova- 
tion, especially on the 
old, gullied, abandoned 
hillside farms of the 
South. It usually 
comes in  spontane- 
ously in such localities, 
but if not, the seed can 
be obtained 
ip in the market y and may be 
planted the 
A same as clo- 
ver seed. After lying for a 
few years in Lespedeza pas- 
ture, these worn-out fields 
may again be brought into 
profitable cultivation by a 
liberal use of fertilizers and 
the frequent planting of 
cowpeas. 
Burr Clover (Medicago 
maculata).—This is another legume that comes up 
spontaneously in some parts of the South. It is an 
annual which germinates in the fall, growing 
slowly throughout the winter and maturing early 
in the spring. It thus affords pasturage at a time 
when the ordinary grasses are dormant. It grows

PASTURE AND FORAGE CROPS 167 
well on closely grazed Bermuda sod; this com- 
bination will give good grazing every month of the 
year. 
The germ causing tubercles on the roots of this 
plant does not occur in all Southern soils ; but if the 
rough, uncleaned seed is used, no other soil inocu- 
lation will be necessary, since in gathering the 
seed the curious twisted pods are raked up off the 
ground and the dust that adheres to them usually 
carries a sufficient number of these germs to serve 
for inoculating the field. 
This plant is closely related to alfalfa and supports 
the same root-tubercle germ. When it is desired to 
sow alfalfa in the Southern states, it is wise to select 
land upon which the burr clover grows or else to 
first plant the land to burr clover, using the un- 
cleaned seed. 
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa).— This mainstay of the 
agriculture of the West is seldom planted at the South 
and only seems to succeed in certain restricted locali- 
ties. Where it can be grown it should be more 
widely planted as it is a most valuable plant for hay 
and pasturage. It is a perennial and when once 
established lasts for a number of years. 
Lands should be very thoroughly prepared for 
sowing alfalfa as it is often rather difficult to secure a 
stand. One of the chief reasons of failure with this 
crop at the South is the fact that most Southern 
soils do not contain the alfalfa tubercle germ, so that 
soil inoculation in some form is necessary. As has 
been stated, one of the easiest methods for doing 
this is to first plant the land to burr clover,  
-P-A-G-E-182
  168 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
using the uncleaned seed. Alfalfa is an efficient 
nitrogen gatherer, and old fields of it when plowed are 
noted for their richness 
and productiveness. The 
plant, however, being a 
perennial and rather diffi- 
cult to establish, is usually 
planted for hay and pas- 
turage rather than for soil- 
improving purposes. 
The seed resembles that 
of clover and it is sown 
broadeast and lightly har- 
rowed in. 
. Peanuts (Arachis hypo- 
gea).—In certain parts of 
the South the peanut is 
cultivated as a commercial 
crop; in this connection, 
however, it will be consid- 
ered chiefly as a forage 
plant. 
In those regions where 
the cornfields are utilized 
for hog pasturage in the 
| fall, it isa common practice 
laabeita. to plant a row of peanuts 
between the corn rows, in- 
stead of cowpeas. The peanut, being also a legume, 
is quite efficient as a nitrogen gatherer. The suc- 
culent tops make excellent pasturage for animals of 
all kinds, and the nuts, which the hogs dig for them- 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
PASTURE AND FORAGE CROPS 169 
selves, are one of the best known feeds for growing 
pigs. Older hogs will also fatten on them rapidly, 
and although the meat is very sweet and fine in 
flavor it shrinks somewhat in cooking, and the lard is 
soft and oily ; it is, therefore, best to finish off peanut- 
fed pigs with a few weeks on corn. The peanut

usually grown for commercial purpose has a trailing, 
prostrate growth, but the small Spanish peanut 
grows erect and the tops are much more available for 
forage, as it can even be cut for hay; the nuts, too, 
fill better on average soils than the larger running 
kinds and, everything considered, it is the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  170 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
satisfactory variety to be planted for forage purposes. 
It grows well on any land suitable for corn or cotton. 
Crimson clover, vetch, cowpeas, velvet beans, and 
beggar weed have been already discussed under the 
head of green manures. They also constitute the 
most important of all Southern forage crops. The 
cowpea is at present much more widely planted and 
utilized as a forage than any of the others. Where 
it thrives, it is unequalled; but on light, sandy soils, 
when it is attacked by wilt and nematodes, it becomes 
necessary to substitute either beggar weed or velvet 
beans. The combination of cowpeas and corn in 
summer, followed by vetch in winter, has already 
been mentioned as a rapid means of improving the 
soil. For the stockman and general farmer it has 
the added advantage of furnishing a maximum amount 
of the most nutritious forage. It.is a combination 
that is most heartily recommended for all parts of 
the cotton belt. 
FIBER PLANTS 
There are a large number of fiber plants that could 
be grown successfully in the Southern states and the 
American tropics. Only two, however, are now 
planted widely enough to require special treatment 
here. Hemp is locally important in certain regions 
in Kentucky, and there are some others such as ramie 
and Sansevieria that are grown occasionally in a 
small experimental way. 
Ramie culture would quickly become an important 
industry if a successful decorticating machine should 
be invented. Many attempts in this.direction have 
been made, but so far without success. The plant
-P-A-G-E-185

grows readily on any strong soil in the Gulf states 
or the tropics. It is a perennial and yields several 
cuttings of stalks during the season. The fiber is a

very beautiful one, making a fabric midway between 
silk and linen in quality. 
Immense quantities of jute and other cheap fibers 
are imported for making bagging. Some of the 
tropical malvaceous weeds yield a fiber that would be 
very suitable for this purpose, and there seems no rea- - 
son why an important industry should not be built 
up in growing these on a large scale and preparing 
the fiber for the market.

172 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
Cotton (Gossypium sp.) 
For a large part of the region which this book is 
intended to cover, cotton is the one preéminently 
important commercial crop. Its preéminence, in fact, 
has long been so great as to be a misfortune, for it 
has been planted so exclusively as to prevent the 
production of home-grown food supplies and to make 
a carefully thought out crop rotation impossible. 
‘Theoretically, cotton should not be an exhaustive 
crop to the soil, especially where the seed or cotton- 
seed meal is returned as a fertilizer.) It requires, 
however, clean cultivation throughout the summer, 
and the average cotton field is left bare and un- 
protected from the washing and leaching of the heavy 
winter rainfall of the cotton belt. The existing system 
of planting cotton after cotton, year after year, can 
only end in impoverishing the richest and deepest 
soils. On the thin, hillside lands so characteristic of 
large areas in the cottgn states, this impoverishment 
comes very quickly. ‘Countless thousands of acres 
of these hill lands have been cleared, cultivated to 
cotton for a few years, until worn and gullied, and 
then have been abandoned. These abandoned gullied 
fields give the whole region a most desolate and unin- 
viting appearance to the passing traveler, and this fact 
has doubtless done much to prevent Northern immigra- 
tion and to retard the agricultural development of this 
region, which really presents so many magnificent 
agricultural possibilities. Thanks largely to the per- 
sistent efforts of the Southern experiment stations, 
the possibilities of mixed husbandry and of better 
agricultural methods are becoming somewhat widely
-P-A-G-E-187

appreciated, and the next few decades will doubtless 
witness a complete revolution in the farming methods 
of the South. This does not mean that cotton will 
not continue to be the chief export money crop, or 
that the Southern states will lose their proud position 
as the foremost cotton-producing region of the world. 
When each Southern farm shall be so managed that 
all the grain, pork, fruits, and vegetables consumed 
on the place are grown at home, and when enough 
cattle and hogs are bred to consume all the forage 
that it is possible to produce in a properly planned 
rotation, only about a third of the area will be 
planted each year in cotton. The resulting reduction 
in acreage will be more than compensated for by the 
much greater fertility of the soil, and the total yield 
will be greater, not less, than it is at present. That 
this is no idle theory has been proved many times 
over by the experience in recent years of those pro- 
gressive planters who have been the first to adopt 
the teachings of modern agriculture. 
Ht, Ever since the days of the Civil War, when the 
“price of cotton was so abnormally high, persistent 
efforts have been made by England and other Euro- 
pean manufacturing countries to encourage the plant- 
ing of cotton in other countries. /So far, however, no 
other region has been found which can really compete 
with the southern part of the United States. Con- 
siderable quantities of cotton are grown in Egypt and 
India, and a very small quantity is now being pro- 
duced in the British West Indies.) Attempts are also 
being made in various parts of Africa. /At the time 
of the Civil War and again in recent years plantings 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
174 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
have been made in Cuba, but never with any perma- 
nent success. It seems that in the future, as in the 
past, the bulk of the world’s supply will continue to 
come from the great Southern cotton belt. 
Climate and Soil. — Cotton is preéminently a plant 
of warm climates. It grows slowly and feebly as 
long as the nights are cool in the spring and only at- 
tains its most rapid growth when the thermometer 
reaches 90°, or above, at midday, and does not fall 
\ below 70° at night. “Tt roots very deeply and hence 
it can endure drought well, especially if given good 
surface cultivation., Excessive rains are always in- 
jurious, and especially so late in the season when the 
bolls begin to open. In the cotton states April and 
May are quite warm and are usually comparatively 
dry. ,; Abundant showers, as a rule, occur during 
midsummer, and dry weather is expected in the 
fall. This makes ideal weather for the cotton crop. 
When, however, cold rains continue late in the spring, 
or when, as sometimes happens, the fall is wet, the crop 
is likely to be seriously injured. ; 
Cotton will grow well on a great variety of soils, but 
there must be good drainage, as standing water about 
the roots is quickly fatal to it. On very rich river- 
bottom soils there is a tendency to grow large stalks 
at the expense of fruit. ‘The ideal cotton soil is a rich 
sandy loam; heavy, stiff clay is not desirable, though 
clay loams give very good results. 
Fertilizers. — Commercial fertilizers are now “used 
extensively for cotton on all old, thin uplands. Com- 
plete fertilizers are usually employed, but the exact 
formula varies somewhat widely in different localities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
FIBER PLANTS 175 
In fact the cotton grower must be his own judge as 
to the fertilizer requirements of his soil. If the plants 
grow tall and rank, and do not fruit sufficiently, use 
less nitrogen and more phosphoric acid; if on the other 
hand the stalk is short and feeble, though attempting 
to fruit heavily, more nitrogen is needed; if the leaves 
spot and fall prematurely, use more potash. Potash 
and nitrogen both tend to prolong the active growing 
season, while phosphoric acid tends to shorten it and 
to promote the early maturity of the crop. The char- 
acter of the fertilizer required will depend, too, very 
largely upon the kind of farming that is being done. 
If cotton is grown after cotton, year after year, with 
no change or rotation, it will soon become necessary 
to add heavier and heavier doses of expensive nitro- 
gen; while if mixed farming is followed with a rota- 
tion that includes cowpeas, as often as every other 
year, it will be necessary to purchase little or no nitro- 
gen, though phosphoric acid and potash may still be 
needed in small quantities. 
Methods of Planting and Cultivating. — Cotton is 
almost universally planted on raised beds or ridges. 
On the lighter soils, where cotton follows cotton, no 
fresh breaking is done in advance of planting. In 
the early spring a furrow is run between the old 
cotton rows with a single-shovel plow, fertilizer is 
deposited in the bottom of this furrow, the workman 
usually dropping it through a large tin horn, to pre- 
vent the wind from scattering it; it is now covered 
by throwing in a furrow from each side with a turn- 
ing plow, thus forming the bed, or ridge, in the space 
occupied by the water furrow the year before. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  176 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
the hill lands, where the cotton rows are so generally 
made to follow the contour lines, the following of the 
old rows is always strictly adhered to, since it requires 
a considerable amount of time and trouble to properly 
lay off the rows in a new field. When planting time 
arrives, which is somewhere from the first to the 
last of April, according to the latitude, the beds are 
freshened up by passing a plank drag or some similar 
device over them, and a one-horse planter is driven 
along the top of the ridge, planting the seed in a 
continuous row, or drill. {When the young plants are 
about three inches high, the first cultivation is given. } 
In the hills, where the contour-line system is followed, 
the implement used. for cultivating is almost univer- 
sally the heel sweep (see page 34). This is held 
at such an angle that one wing of the sweep scrapes 
the surface of the ridge, upon which the cotton is 
growing. It is usually run about an inch below the 
surface, and throws a little dirt toward the plant, 
thus leaving a beneficial dust mulch; and it is very 
effective in killing young grass and weeds. An ex- 
pert plowman will run one of these implements so 
that the end of the sweep will almost touch the plant, 
thus obviating the use of the hoe. It, however, works 
only one side of the row, requiring two trips to each 
row. On level land, where the rows can be laid 
straight, a regular two-horse corn cultivator can be 
used to great advantage in the cotton field, for as they 
work both sides of the row only one trip is required. 
On level lands, too, disk cultivators can be very 
economically used for throwing up the beds on which 
to plant. After the first cultivation, when the plants
-P-A-G-E-191
  FIBER PLANTS aber 
are four to six inches high, they are chopped to a 
stand with the hoe, usually from one to three stalks 
being left to a hill. The distance between the hills 
varies considerably according to the richness of the 
land. On poor, thin lands they are usually left 
about a foot apart, and on very rich land they are 
often as much as three feet apart. Cotton should be 
given clean cultivation during the entire growing 
season. A cultivator or sweep should be passed 
through the rows often enough to keep down all weeds 
and grass, and to break the crust and leave a dust 
mulch after every rain. It may be necessary to go 
through the fields two or three times with a hoe, but 
if the cultivation has been properly done, there will 
be but little work left for the hoes. 
Harvesting. — Cotton picking usually begins early 
in August, and lasts through November or even 
later. ! This work has all to be done by hand and is 
the most laborious and expensive part of the cotton 
business. Many attempts have been made to con- 
struct mechanical cotton pickers, but so far none of 
them haye been successful./It is the question of 
picking that limits the possible production of cotton 
in any given region. When the cotton is picked, it 
is hauled direct to the gin or to some temporary 
storehouse.’ After ginning to remove the seeds 
the lint is packed in bales weighing four hundred or 
five hundred pounds. ' It is pressed very closely in 
these bales, but when being prepared for distant 
shipment, the bales are further subjected to heavy 
hydraulic pressure which reduces them to about a 
fourth their former bulk. 
N
-P-A-G-E-192
  178 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
Cotton is mostly sold by the farmers to local 
buyers; each town of any size in the cotton belt 
being a cotton market. 
Uses. — Cotton is, of course, grown for the lint or 
fiber which surrounds the seeds. * This fiber is more 
universally useful than any other., Formerly no 
other part of the plant was utilized, the seed being 
allowed to go to waste at the gins. Now the manu- 
facture of oil from the seed has become a very im- 
portant business and the sale of the seeds adds an 
item of much profit to the crops The cake left after 
pressing the oil from the seed is ground into a meal 
which furnishes a rich food for cattle and is also ex- 
tensively used as a fertilizer: 
Its high feeding and manurial value is due to the 
large percentage of nitrogen which it contains. A 
good grade of meal will analyze about seven per 
cent nitrogen. As a feed it is used exclusively for 
cattle. Horses do not relish it, and it is unsafe to 
feed it to hogs. Fed in small rations of from one 
to three pounds per day, in connection with pastur- 
age, corn stoyer, or other coarse forage, it forms an 
excellent maintenance ration for work cattle and 
young steers. To fattening steers, it may be fed in 
much larger quantities, but if this heavy feeding is 
continued for more than three months, injurious re- 
sults are likely to follow. When used judiciously, it 
is a most useful food for milch cows. It stimulates 
the flowof milk and, what is an important quality 
for Southern butter makers, it gives a butter fat 
with a markedly higher melting point than that pro- 
duced by other feeds. Heavy feeding with cotton-
-P-A-G-E-193
  FIBER PLANTS 179 
seed meal is thought to injure the flavor of the butter, 
but with moderate feeding no such result is noticed, 
the only effect being to make the butter stand up 
and handle better in the warm Southern climate. 
Cotton-seed oil is applied to many uses. Com- 
bined with tallow it is largely used in adulterating 
lard; it may also be used in the pure state as a sub- 
stitute for lard in cooking, and much of it when re- 
fined is converted into salad oil. 
Botanical Features: Varieties. —The many kinds 
of cotton grown in the United States may all be 
grouped under two species: the upland cottons all 
belonging to Gossypium hirsutum, and the Sea Island 
cotton to Gossypium Barbadense. ' 
The seeds of the upland cotton are densely clothed, 
underneath the fiber, with a coating of short greenish 
hairs, and the flowers are white or light cream color 
when they first open, turning pinkish as they wither. 
« The Sea Island cotton has smooth, black seeds 
and the freshly opened flowers are bright yellow. 
The perennial, so-called tree cotton of tropical 
America belongs to a species closely related to the 
Sea Island cotton. It is frequently seen planted 
about dwellings, but is of no commercial importance. 
There are many varieties of upland cotton in cul- 
tivation. These can be placed in two principal 
groups: the cluster cottons and the long-limbed, big- 
bolled cottons. Varieties of the first class are usu- 
ally earlier in maturing and are the only ones 
planted in the more northerly part of the cotton belt. 
The big-bolled cottons do best, as a rule, on the 
moister, richer lands.  
-P-A-G-E-194
  180 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
The upland cottons are quite plastic and variable, 
so that improved strains are readily secured by at- 
tention to seed selection. Some of these better 
strains now almost equal the Sea Island cotton in 
length of fiber, and command a considerable pre- 
mium over the common grades in the market. Sea 
Island cotton is much less extensively cultivated, 
and but few named varieties have been developed. 
It has been found possible, however, to greatly im- 
prove it by seed selection, and many of the more 
prominent planters have special strains of their own 
growing. The phenomenal success obtained by ex- 
perts from the Department of Agriculture in select- 
ing a strain of Sea Island cotton that is resistant to 
the terrible wilt disease is one of the most striking 
examples of the wonderful possibilities that may be 
secured by care in selecting the seed of our cultivated 
crops. 
Diseases and Insects. — The insects attacking 
cotton have been very thoroughly studied by the 
entomologists of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, and are fully discussed in their various 
publications. The three most important are the boll 
weevil, the boll worm, and the caterpillar4 Of these 
the boll weevil is by far the most destructive, and 
threatens seriously to curtail production. ‘This in- 
sect is a native of Mexico, Central America, and 
Cuba. It finally crossed the Rio Grande into Texas, 
and for a number of years has been spreading 
steadily northward and eastward, until it now 
seems certain that it will eventually occupy the 
entire cotton belt of the Southern states. So far
-P-A-G-E-195
  
FIBER PLANTS 181 
it has not been found in Jamaica, Porto Rico, or the” 
smaller West Indies. The female beetle deposits 
her eggs in the soft young bolls or in the flower 
buds; the young grub developing within the tissues 
of the plant is protected from the application of 
insecticides, and no practicable remedy has been 
found for destroying this terrible pest. The insect 
passes the winter in its adult stage and within the 
boundaries of the United States comparatively few 
of them are able to persist until the season for the 
flowering of cotton. The first brood, therefore, does 
little damage; they multiply rapidly, however, so 
that in all infested regions the later, so-called top 
crop is almost completely destroyed. By taking ad- 
vantage of these facts, cultural methods have been 
devised by means of which it is still possible to pro- 
duce a fair crop, notwithstanding the presence of the 
weevil. The earliest maturing varieties are selected, 
seed is planted as early as possible, and fertilizers 
are applied and cultivation given with the view of 
hastening the ripening of the crop in every possible 
way. After the first pickings have been secured, or 
as soon as the majority of the young bolls are seen 
to be infested, the entire crop is promptly plowed 
under, without attempting to harvest the later 
pickings. Great pains should be taken to destroy 
absolutely every cotton plant in order to prevent the 
maturing of the late brood of beetles. Profitable 
crops are now being secured in even the worst 
infested regions, although the yields obtained are 
necessarily smaller than when it was possible to con- 
tinue picking throughout the season. Success with 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
182 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
these new methods requires the selection of the earli- 
est possible strains of cotton, and of those which tend 
to heavy flowering early in the season. The use of 
a large percentage of phosphoric acid in the fertilizer 
employed is also important, since this substance 
tends to promote heavy fruiting and early ripening. 
Heavy applications of nitrogen and potash, on the 
contrary, have a tendency to prolong the growing 
season and to retard the setting of the crop. Ex- 
periments in Cuba have shown that even under 
tropical conditions it may be possible to grow cotton 
in spite of the presence of the boll weevil, by treating 
it strictly as an annual crop, and promptly destroy- 
ing the plants at the end of the picking season, 
provided that the precaution is always taken of 
destroying all of the half-wild native cotton through- 
out a considerable surrounding area. 
The boll worm is closely related to the cutworms. 
The young larve bore into the bolls, and, after feed- 
ing for a time, emerge and enter fresh bolls, the same 
larva thus destroying several bolls in a few weeks. 
Besides cotton, these insects bore into green toma- 
toes in the same manner, being a very destructive 
enemy of this crop in all parts of the South. The 
boll worm is also the familiar corn worm so fre- 
quently found entering the ends of the ears of green 
corn. While thése three are its usual food plants, it 
is not confined to them, as it is occasionally found 
boring into various other fruits and pods. Owing 
to its habit of feeding so largely on the interior 
tissue, this insect is very difficult to combat by the 
use of insecticides ; in fact, no effective remedy has 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  FIBER PLANTS 183 
been devised for it. The losses that it occasions 
reach large figures each season. It has been found 
to slightly prefer corn to cotton, and a small measure 
of protection may be secured by planting occasional 
rows of corn through the cotton field. During the 
period when the corn is in silk, the worms will be 
attracted by it instead of by the cotton. 
The cotton caterpillar is also related to the cut- 
worms and the army worm. In habit it is much like 
the latter. In certain seasons it suddenly appears in 
immense numbers, and if allowed to go unchecked, 
will, in a very few days, entirely defoliate even the 
largest cotton fields. When this insect first appeared, 
it created great alarm, and for some years caused 
enormous losses to the cotton industry. However, 
it was soon found to be easily controlled by the use 
of Paris green, so now the loss from it is small. 
The Paris green is usually applied in the form of 
powder. A quantity is placed in each of two thin 
muslin bags, which are tied on the ends of a short 
pole, that is the length of the distance between the 
rows of cotton; this pole is then placed across the 
saddle in front of a man on a mule, who rides up 
and down between the rows, the jolting of the mule 
sifting enough of the Paris green through the muslin 
to poison the leaves effectively and economically. 
It is only in occasional years that this insect ap- 
pears in sufficient numbers to attract attention, <A 
serious outbreak can be quickly subdued by the 
above simple remedy. 
The diseases of cotton were first seriously studied 
by Professor G. F, Atkinson, while connected with the
-P-A-G-E-198
    184 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
Alabama Experiment Station. The literature of the 
subject will be found in the bulletins of that institution 
and in the publications on plant pathology issued by 
the Department of Agriculture. 
Only the more important of them will be considered 
here. 
The term “rust” or “ blight ” is applied toa widely 
occurring diseased condition of cotton, the most con- 
spicuous feature of which is the spotting and prema- 
ture falling of the leaves. These spotted leaves are 
found to be infested by any of three or four different 
species of fungi. These are all, however, what are 
known as facultative parasites ; that is, they are only 
able to invade leaves that have been weakened by 
some other cause, and cannot, like the true rusts, 
attack them when growing vigorously. The disease 
is an obscure one and its exact nature has not yet 
been satisfactorily determined. It is usually worse 
on thin, sandy lands, and is especially serious when 
periods of excessive rainfall are followed by a sharp 
drought. It may, however, be induced by any un- 
favorable conditions that suddenly arrest growth. 
The facts seem to be that while leaves are young 
and thrifty they have the power of repelling the 
attacks of these fungi, but as they approach maturity 
or have their vitality suddenly checked they are no 
longer able to do so. With the development of the 
fungi the leaves soon turn yellow and fall off, thus 
preventing the maturity of all the later part of the 
crop. In badly rusted fields the yield will be reduced 
to a half or a fourth of the normal. That this 
disease is primarily connected with the nutrition of
-P-A-G-E-199
  FIBER PLANTS 185 
the plant is shown by the fact that richer places in 
the field, as for instance old fence rows, always show 
a considerable immunity, and further that the disease 
can be quite effectively controlled by incorporating 
more vegetable matterin the soil and by applying pot- 
ash. On manysoils the application of from a hundred 
totwo hundred pounds of kainit per acre will act almost 
asa specific. The excessive use of phosphoric acid 
without potash greatly increases the injury. On land 
subject to rust the disease can be quite perfectly con- 
trolled by following a rotation like that suggested on 
page 145, which shall provide for at least one crop of 
cowpeas between cotton crops, and by the use of fer- 
tilizers rich in potash. In other words, the appearance 
of rust is a sure indication of soil exhaustion. 
Cotton wilt (Meocosmospora) or Frenching, as it is 
sometimes called, is due to the growth of a fungus 
within the tissues of the stem and roots. Affected 
plants soon become somewhat dwarfed and the leaves 
assume an unnatural aspect, sometimes being streaked 
with yellow or brown. Usually after a time the 
whole plant suddenly wilts and in a few days dies. 
When only a part of the stalk is affected, the plant 
may linger throughout the season and even produce a 
partial crop. The fungus develops principally along 
the ducts in the vascular bundles, where its presence 
can be detected by the brown staining of the bun- 
dles, which is easily seen when cutting off the diseased 
stem. The sudden wilting occurs when the fungus 
develops so rapidly as to plug these ducts and thus 
prevent the upward flow of sap from the roots. This 
fungus is able to live over in the soil from one season
-P-A-G-E-200
186 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
to the next and when it once makes its appearance in 
the field, the diseased area continues to spread from 
year to year until finally the culture of cotton has 
to be abandoned. 
The disease occurs in many parts of the cotton belt, 
but has been most destructive in the famous Sea 
Island cotton region along the coast of Georgia and 
South Carolina. At one time it seriously threatened 
to prevent the culture of this crop on many of the 
lands best suited to it. Officials of the Department 
of Agriculture were detailed to study the disease, 
and they observed occasional plants in the infected 
areas that remained healthy and vigorous through- 
out the season. Seed was saved from these plants 
and in the course of a few years a resistant race 
was developed, by selection, which possessed almost 
complete immunity from this disease. Strains of re- 
sistant upland cotton have also been found, so that it 
is now possible to grow full crops of cotton on lands 
that are thoroughly infested by the wilt fungus. 
This is one of the most striking instances of the 
possibility of overcoming a serious plant disease 
by the selection and breeding of immune races. 
Fungi that are microscopically indistinguishable from 
the one causing cotton wilt produce similar diseases 
in cowpeas, watermelons, and various other crops. 
It seems to be a fact, however, that the disease is not 
usually communicable from one of these crops to an- 
other. No methods have been discovered for treat- 
ing these wilts by topical applications. 
Another disease known as root rot (Ozonium) causes 
* the wilting of cotton in certain portions of Texas. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  FIBER PLANTS 
iL Hh is caused by a fungus which attacks the outside of the? 
roots, enveloping them in a web of yellowish fibers. 
The same fungus attacks a large number of other 
plants; no effective remedy has yet been found and 
cultivation of cotton has been practically abandoned 
on infected areas.? 
A disease known as anthracnose (Colletotricwm) 
is common in nearly all parts of the cotton belt. 
This fungus causes small sunken spots, usually sur- 
rounded by a reddish brown border. It often ap- 
pears on the young seed leaves, when they first 
emerge from the ground; it also develops on the 
stem, and is found with other fungi on the leaves of 
plants affected with rust, but the principal injury it 
causes is to the bolls. If the young bolls are badly 
affected, they fail to open properly, but often crack 
prematurely, thus causing the rotting of the immature 
contents. The disease is usually worse on rich lands 
and in wet seasons, which cause a rank, sappy growth. 
No practical remedy is known. 
Cotton bolls are also often destroyed by a bacterial 
disease known as boll rot. Like the anthracnose 
this is worse in wet seasons, and on rich, moist lands. 
This disease has not been fully studied, but is prob- 
ably conveyed from boll to boll by the puncture of 
insects. The only remedial measure is to plant at 
sufficient distance to allow for a free circulation of 
1 While the above lines were in press a paper has appeared 
(U.S. Dept. Agric., Bureau of Pl. Ind., Bull. 102: 89-42) on ‘* The 
Control of Texas Root-Rot of Cotton,” by Shear & Mills. As the 
result of recent experiments the authors advise very deep fall 
plowing of infected lands and also a strict rotation with grass or 
grain crops.
-P-A-G-E-202
  188 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
air, thus securing the prompt drying of the bolls, 
when wet from rain or dew. 
Another serious trouble of the cotton planter is 
the shedding of the young bolls, thus causing the 
plant to fail to set a sufficient crop. This shedding 
is not due to insects or fungi, but seems to be caused 
by some derangement of nutrition. It may occur if 
the weather is either too wet or too dry; but is 
more frequently caused by a period of sharp drought 
following abundant rains that have caused the plants 
to take on a rapid growth. No remedy is known 
except to give such cultivation as will avoid, so far 
as is possible, sudden checks in the development of 
the plants. 
Sisal (Agave sps.) 
This plant furnishes a strong, coarse fiber that is 
largely used in the manufacture of rope, binder twine, 
and other cordage. For these purposes it is excelled 
in importance only by the Manila hemp, which is 
produced. by a species of banana, grown in the Phil- 
ippine Islands. Sisal, or heniquen, as it is often called, 
is grown very extensively on the Yucatan peninsula 
in Mexico, and is also planted to some extent in the 
Bahamas and at certain points in northern Cuba. 
To succeed best, the plant requires a dry, rocky, lime- 
stone soil. It does not withstand frost, so can be 
grown only in tropical regions. While the plant 
grows well on deeper, richer land, it is too pulpy in 
such situations and yields a smaller percentage of 
fiber. Commercial plantings are entirely confined to
-P-A-G-E-203
  
  
     
-P-A-G-E-204

-P-A-G-E-205
FIBER PLANTS 189 
regions where the soil is too thin and rocky to pro- 
duce other crops. No fertilizers are used for sisal. 
The plants when growing thriftily throw up numer- 
ous suckers from the roots. These are used for 
starting new plantations. Bulbels are also produced 
in immense numbers on the flowering stalks. These 
are sometimes used for planting, but require from 
one to two years longer to reach maturity. The 
ground selected for sisal is usually too rocky to ad- 
mit of plowing, and is, therefore, cleared of brush 
with a machete, and the dry grass and brush is burned. 
Small holes are now chopped in the soil at a distance 
of from seven to nine feet and a sucker planted in 
each hole. No great pains is required in planting, 
except to see that enough earth or stone is piled 
around the sucker to hold it erect. Subsequent cul- 
tivation consists simply in chopping down grass and 
weeds with hoe or machete as often as may be neces- 
sary to prevent them from smothering the plants. 
From three to five years are required before the 
plants gain sufficient size to admit of harvesting. 
After this time one or two of the large, fleshy, lower 
leaves may be cut each month, and as the plant con- 
tinues to yield for a number of years, the total 
amount of fiber produced is considerable. With the 
price that has prevailed since the Spanish-American 
War this industry has been very profitable. The 
leaves are taken to a pulping machine which sepa- 
rates the fiber. This is dried and then baled for 
market. 
The kind usually found in the Bahamas differs 
somewhat from that of Yucatan and is considered to 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  190 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
be a distinct species. They are about equal as fiber 
producers, but the Yucatan variety lasts longer be- 
fore flowering, so that fields do not require replant- 
ing as often. These plants, like all the other Agaves, 
or so-called century plants, produce only a rosette of 
stiff, fleshy leaves for a number of years, the number 
differing with the species, when a gigantic flower 
stalk appears, and after flowering the plant dies. 
Other fiber-yielding species of the same group occur 
in Mexico, also in Cuba, and other of the West In- 
dies, but none have so far proved of much commer- 
cial importance. 
But little attention has been paid to the diseases 
and insects of sisal. Plants are sometimes infested 
by mealy bugs, and they are also attacked by a 
fungus which causes an anthracnose, or pitlike 
spotting of the leaves; no remedies are used for 
either trouble. 
Topacco (Nicotiana Tabacum) 
Tobacco isa plant of great importance to Southern 
agriculture. While grown under a rather wide range 
of conditions, its cultivation is usually restricted to 
certain well-defined areas, where the farmers have 
become accustomed to the methods of handling this 
exacting and sensitive crop. 
The different classes of tobacco have different re- 
quirements as tosoiland climate. The heavy plug to- 
baccoes require a rich, rather heavy clay loam ; while 
to produce the best types of cigar tobacco, a light, 
sandy soil is necessary. Bright plug and smoking
-P-A-G-E-207
TT NT ne ae 
TOBACCO 191 : 
tobaccoes, being intermediate in quality, require in- 
termediate grades of soil; but in every case the soil 
must be in the best possible state of tilth, and if not 
abundantly supplied with all the elements of fertility, 
these must be freely added in the form of fertilizers 
and manures. Tobacco soils should contain much 
humus. The crop is a very exhausting one, and 
even the richest soils soon become depleted of this 
important substance, unless active measures are taken 
to maintain fertility. This can be done by the free 
use of stable manure supplemented by the addition 
of some form of phosphoric acid and of potash. 
This latter substance is especially necessary in the 
cultivation of cigar and smoking tobaccoes, since the 
burning quality as well as the flavor, or aroma, is 
largely dependent upon its presence. Tobacco draws 
very heavily upon the supply of potash in the soil, and 
it isof great importance to guard carefully against its 
exhaustion. 
In the application of potash to tobacco land 
special care must be taken to exclude all forms of 
this material that contain chlorine, as this substance, 
when present, even in small quantities, spoils the 
burning quality. The muriate of potash and crude 
salts, like kainit, should, therefore, never be used. 
The high-grade sulphate is the form in which potash 
is most often applied to tobacco, but the carbonate, 
though slightly more expensive, is preferred by some 
when the highest type of cigar tobacco is desired. 
Stable manure, although so useful, is usually unduly 
expensive in Southern countries, even when it can 
be obtained at all. The long growing season at the  
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
South, however, usually will permit of the growing 
of some leguminous crop while the land is not occu- 
pied by the tobacco, and when this can be done, it 
can safely be substituted for the more expensive 
stable manure. This is especially true in Cuba and 
Porto Rico, where tobacco is a winter crop and the 
land lies idle throughout the rainy summer season. 
When the tobacco growers of these regions shall all 
have learned to plant their harvested tobacco fields 
in the spring to velvet beans, the rank growth of 
these vines during the summer will furnish an im- 
mense amount of nitrogenous vegetable matter to 
be plowed under in the fall, and the results will be 
a great economy over the methods of manuring now 
in vogue. Tobacco only requires a short growing 
season, and therefore thrives under a great variety 
of climatic conditions. It requires less water than 
many other crops. Frequent showers are an advan- 
tage during the early period of growth, but dry 
weather is to be preferred as the plants approach 
maturity and during the time of harvesting and cur- 
ing. Where water is available for irrigation, the dry 
winter months of Cuba and Porto Rico furnish ideal 
weather conditions for its growth. 
The best formula for tobacco fertilizers will natu- 
rally differ with different soil conditions, but one 
containing two parts of phosphoric acid and two 
parts potash for each part of nitrogen will be well 
adapted to average conditions. 
Planting and Cultivation. — Tobacco is always sown 
in seed beds, and the young plants are transplanted to 
the field when of sufficient size. Seed-bed problems
-P-A-G-E-209
  
TOBACCO 193 
are among the most important for the tobacco grower, 
this being especially true in tropical countries. The 
primitive method of making seed beds, and one that 
is still very largely in use, is to clear a space in the 
forest, burn the brush where it lies, and after slightly 
stirring the soil with a hoe to incorporate the coating 
of ashes, the seed is scattered broadcast. At the 
North a low frame is usually built around the bed 
and covered with cloth to protect the young plants 
from cold. The advantages of this method are that 
strong, fresh soil is secured for the young plants, and 
all seeds of weeds which might otherwise overshadow 
the tiny tobacco plants have been destroyed by fire. 
More important still, however, is the fact that the fire 
has also served to sterilize the soil by killing the myce- 
lium of the various damping-off fungi, by which it is 
so often infested. This is a matter of the utmost 
importance at the South, where seed beds are started 
during warm weather. When damp, rainy weather 
follows the sowing of seed beds in Cuba and Porto 
Rico, immense losses are occasioned by the damping 
off of the young plantlets. The trouble is not so 
serious at the North, where seed is sown in the cool 
weather of the spring; but whenever it is found neces- 
sary to make seed beds on old land, some method for 
sterilizing the soil should be adopted. This may be 
accomplished by piling on brush and burning it, the 
same as in the woods, by applying live steam through 
perforated pipes, or by the free use of boiling water. 
Chemical sterilization is also practicable. Thoroughly 
spraying the surface of the soil, both before and after 
sowing, with Bordeaux mixture, gives a considerable 
° 
   
-P-A-G-E-210
  194 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
protection from this trouble. ' Applications of forma- 
lin to the soil before sowing also prove effective, but 
the expense is too great to make it a feasible rem- 
edy. Soils are now quite widely sterilized for green- 
house purposes by the use of live steam, and where 
steam boilers are at hand this is probably the most 
efficient system of soil sterilization. 
When the young plants are from four to six inches 
high, they are ready to move to the field. The ground 
should have been plowed, cross plowed, and thor- 
oughly harrowed in order to put it in the most per- 
fect condition of tilth possible. Light furrows are 
now opened for the rows, and if commercial fertilizer 
is used, a. portion at least is scattered in the furrows. 
The distance between the rows will depend upon the 
type of tobacco to be grown. For cigar tobacco three 
feet or even less is usual; but the heavier kinds re- 
quire a greater distance. The young plants are now 
planted by hand or with a dibble in the bottom of 
these furrows, the cigar types being one foot or less 
' apart and double the distance for the heavier ones. 
Mechanical planters drawn by horses are also in use 
in some sections. Young tobacco plants, if pulled 
from the seed beds in proper condition, are very | 
resistant, and if the soil is at all moist they will not 
require watering when transplanted; but in very 
dry weather watering is essential. Plants are likely 
to wilt badly at first, but in two or three days, when 
new rootlets have been formed, will stand erect and 
soon begin to grow rapidly# As soon as this wilting 
is past, the first cultivation should be given, in 
order to fill in the planting furrow. From this time
-P-A-G-E-211
TOBACCO 195 
on cultivation should be frequent until such time as 
the plants get large enough to practically shade the 
ground. In Cuba this cultivation is all done with 
the hoe, but this is unduly expensive. Any of the one- 
horse cultivators with numerous small teeth can be 
used successfully in young tobacco. As the plants 
get older a heel sweep, so much used by the cotton 
planters, is preferable, as the long, narrow wing will 
stir the ground under the leaves without breaking 
them When the tobacco reaches a certain height, 
depending upon the kind and the richness of the soil, 
it is topped by pinching out the terminal bud in order 
to prevent its seeding and to give an increased de- 
velopment to the leaves. Suckers will now start in 
the axils of the leaves, and it is necessary to go over 
the field every few days to remove them, thus con- 
fining the growth to the leaves already formed on 
the stemy 
It has been found that growing the plants in par- 
tial shade profoundly affects the character of the leaf, 
making it thinner and also freer from gum resins 
and nicotine. The plants, too, grow taller and the 
leaves are larger, making them more useful for cigar 
wrappers. In Cuba rows of bananas are often planted 
in the tobacco fields to furnish shade and act as wind- 
breaks. The practice of covering tobacco fields 
with cheese cloth to give shade and thus secure leaves 
of greater value for wrappers originated in Connect- 
icut, but is now more employed in Cuba and Porto 
Rico. The cloth, which is specially woven for the 
purpose with strong threads and wide meshes, is 
stretched over wires that are supported by posts high   
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
enough to admit of horse cultivation. The sides as 
well as the top are covered, thus giving protection from 
winds and incidentally excluding insects. Notwith- 
standing the expense involved, thismethod often proves 
highly profitable, owing to the high prices obtained 
for superior wrappers; but there is always danger, es- 
pecially on light soils and in cloudy weather, that the 
shading may be overdone, in which case the leaf will 
be too thin and papery and will lack the elasticity 
necessary for a good wrapper. Shade-grown tobacco 
never develops the full aroma of that produced in 
the open air. 
Harvesting. — When the leaves are fully grown, 
one accustomed to tobacco will note a slight change 
of color, which indicates the approach of maturity. 
It requires experience and good judgment to know 
just when to cut tobacco, as the quality of the crop 
depends to a considerable degree upon the exact stage 
of ripeness at which it is harvested. Just prior to 
the change of color, before alluded to, the glandular 
hairs which cover the surface of the leaves are very 
active in secreting an essential oil that accumulates 
in little globules at their tips. Later this dries to 
a small resinous mass, so that’ tobacco which has be- 
come too ripe is less aromatic, stiffer, and more brittle 
upon curing. 
Three different methods of cutting tobacco are 
employed. In some places the entire plant is cut at 
the ground, carried in, and hung on poles or laths 
in the curing barns. In Cuba the usual custom is to 
cut the stem into short pieces in such a way that two 
leaves are left on each piece; these are then hung on
-P-A-G-E-213
  TOBACCO 197 
the poles. With the best grades of high-priced 
tobacco it is now more usual to harvest the leaves 
singly and string them for curing by passing a 
needle through the thick midrib. As the lower 
leaves always mature first, this plan enables the 
planter to make two or three cuttings and harvest 
each leaf in the best condition of ripeness, and thus 
gives a greater uniformity in the product. Cigar 
tobaccoes are generally allowed to cure naturally 
without the use of heat. With some of the plug 
tobaccoes artificial heat is usually employed in the 
curing barns. In either case great care and consider- 
able experience is required during the curing pro- 
cess. Tobacco barns are generally so built that they 
may be either closed tightly or given free ventilation 
according to the state of the weather and condition 
of the contents. The curing of tobacco depends 
upon the action of internal ferments, called enzymes, 
such as are concernedyin the ripening of fruit and in 
producing the autumn coloration of forest leaves. 
Drying must not proceed too rapidly or these enzymes 
do not have time to do their work, and instead of the 
rich attractive brown the tobacco will turn to a dirty 
green. That this change of color is due to activities 
taking place within the living cells of the leaf may 
be conclusively shown by crushing the cells over 
certain areas; as when a name is written heavily on 
the leaf with a pencil, such injured areas remain green 
upon drying, and the name appears in green letters 
upon the brown background of the leaf. A rather 
moist air should be maintained in the tobacco house 
during the first few days of curing, in order to
-P-A-G-E-214
  198 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
allow time for these fermentative changes. Later 
“more ventilation must be given, especially if the 
weather is damp; otherwise there will be great 
danger of mold, which will seriously injure the leaf. 
After the tobacco has become thoroughly dry it is 
taken down from the poles and tied in small bundles 
called hands. A damp day is selected for this work, 
so that it can be done without breaking the leaves. 
These hands are banked together in a pile and are 
carefully covered to induce a further fermentation. 
If not damp enough, it is slightly sprinkled. The 
temperature of the pile is carefully, watched, and 
before it gets hot enough to cause injury the pile is 
torn down and rebuilt in such a way that the hands 
which were on the outside are now placed in the 
center. The extent to which the fermentation is 
carried depends upon the character of the tobacco, 
and like the cutting and curing, requires careful and 
experienced oversight. After the fermentation to- 
bacco is carefully sorted into different grades, when 
it is ready for bailing and shipping. 
Botanical Features. — Botanically, tobacco belongs 
to the great family of the Solanacee, which gives us 
such other well-known economic plants as the potato, 
tomato, egg plant, and pepper. Tobacco flowers are 
adapted for self-pollination, and this has an important 
practical bearing upon the question of seed selection. 
When a plant of a particularly desirable type appears 
ina field, if an ordinary paper bag is slipped over the 
inflorescence just before the first flowers open, it will 
exclude all foreign pollen, and the seed produced 
will be the pure progeny of the one desirable plant.
-P-A-G-E-215
TOBACCO 199 
Tobacco comes very true to type, and a single plant 
yields such a large quantity of seed that it is easy,’ 
with a little care, to secure a sufficient supply from 
the best plants: A considerable number of varieties 
of tobacco are in cultivation that are adapted to the 
different purposes for which. it is grown; but all of 
them can easily be much improved by a little care 
in seed selection. 
Diseases and Insects. — Tobacco is attacked by a 
number of diseases and insects, only“a few of which 
can be discussed. The damping-off fungus (Rhizoc- 
tonia) that causes such heavy losses in the seed beds, 
especially in the tropics, has~already-been~referred 
to, and. several methods of combating it suggested. 
This must be considered as one of the most serious . 
diseases of the crop, and much more study is needed 
to determine the best way of controlling it under 
different conditions. The flea-beetle (Hpetriv) is 
also quite frequently injurious in the seed beds, 
biting small holes on the under side of the leaves, 
This insect is repelled to a considerable extent by 
applications of Bordeaux mixture. Spraying the 
young plantlets with Bordeaux as a preventive for 
the damping-off fungus will also serve to largely 
obviate trouble from this pest. For the flea-beetle 
it is best, however, to add Paris green to the spray. 
It is probable that applications of Bordeaux mixture 
to tobacco seed beds will always more than pay their 
cost in the increased vigor of the plants secured, even 
when no serious outbreak of damping off occurs. 
When the plants are set in the field, they are liable to 
be destroyed by various cutworms and other related  
-P-A-G-E-216
  200 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
larve. Baiting the field in advance of planting 
with a poisoned bran mash is the best remedy for 
these insects. It is best to sweeten the mash with 
a little molasses, which will also make it more 
adhesive. It should be scattered in the field at least 
a week before planting. 
The well-known large green tobacco worm, which is 
the larva of a Sphinx moth (Protoparce), is a widely 
destructive tobacco enemy. It may be controlled 
either by hand picking or by dusting with Paris 
green. In the tropics Paris green is also largely 
used for insects of the climbing cutworm type. 
Several fungous leaf-spot diseases of tobacco are 
known, but as a rule they are not seriously trouble- 
some, and.little attempt-has been made to treat them. 
Bordeaux mixture would be the natural remedy, but 
its use is not permissible as it adheres so long that its 
presence on the leaf would be objectionable. Bacte- 
rial root rot of tobacco has appeared in certain local- 
ities, but so far it has been rather local and as yet 
no efficient remedy can be suggested. 
An obscure disease of tobacco that is not of para- 
sitic origin occurs quite frequently and is widely 
distributed. The plant becomes somewhat dwarfed, 
the leaves are wrinkled, and streaked and spotted 
with yellow; it is known under-various names, but 
the-term “ mosaic disease ” isthe one usually applied, 
on account of the peculiar coloring of the leaves. The 
disease seems to be entirely functional and is due 
to the improper secretion of some enzyme. This 
trouble seems to be induced by anything which 
strongly shocks the plant and suddenly interrupts its
-P-A-G-E-217

-P-A-G-E-218
  
    Coffee Tree with Fruit.
-P-A-G-E-219
  COFFEE 201 
growth. It can be induced artificially by injuring 
the roots. When the crop is harvested, the suckers 
which spring up from the roots often show the 
disease, even though the parent plant was entirely 
normal. Plants that have been burned by improper 
applications of Paris green also often develop 
mosaic disease. Good cultural methods which 
avoid shock or injury of any kind to the plant, and 
which keep it growing steadily and thriftily, are the 
best safeguards against this trouble. Care in the 
seed beds is also necessary, since poor, stunted plants 
are more likely to develop this disease. 
CoFFEE (Coffea sps.) 
Coffee is strictly a tropical product. In a natural 
state it grows as an undershrub in mountainous 
forests, and when cultivated the same conditions 
must be somewhat closely approximated. It is 
grown extensively in Mexico, Central and South 
America, and Porto Rico. Formerly it was one of 
the principal crops of Cuba; but owing to the high 
price of labor and the greater profit in sugar cane, its 
cultivation has been nearly abandoned. 
The best coffee is usually grown at an altitude of 
from two to five thousand feet, and often on land too 
steep for the cultivation of other crops. It is 
injured by periods of prolonged drought and thrives 
best where the rainfall is somewhat evenly distrib- 
uted throughout the year. 
The best soils are rather heavy clays well provided 
with humus.
-P-A-G-E-220
  202 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
Coffee is usually planted on forest lands. Insome 
cases the underbrush is simply cut away and the 
trees are thinned, leaving only enough of the origi- 
nal growth standing to afford the partial shade that 
is necessary for the plants. At other times the land 
is entirely cleared and special kinds of shade trees 
are planted with the coffee. Different trees are pre- 
ferred in different regions. Leguminous trees are the 
ones usually selected, since these are always provided 
with root tubercles and serve to enrich the soil by 
collecting atmospheric nitrogen in the same way as the 
soil-improving herbaceous legumes. At the higher 
altitudes shade is unnecessary and is seldom used. 
Young coffee plants are often pulled up for trans- 
planting where seeds have germinated under the trees 
in an old plantation, but it is better to prepare 
special seed beds, in order that the seedlings can re- 
ceive some attention. The seed beds must be shaded; 
palm thatch usually serves for this purpose. The 
young trees are planted when about two feet high at 
distances varying from six to ten feet apart. The 
mistake is often made of planting too closely. This 
gives weak, spindling trees which are more subject to 
various diseases. Horse cultivation is seldom at- 
tempted, but the ground between the trees is kept 
clean with hoe or machete. When the forest is en- 
tirely cleared, bananas are often planted in order to 
make a quick, temporary shade while the permanent 
shade trees are growing. When this is done, con- 
stant care is required to keep them sufficiently thinned 
out to prevent the crowding and overshading of the 
coffee, and they should be entirely dug out as soon as
-P-A-G-E-221
  COFFEE 203 
the permanent shade trees have grown large enough 
to answer their purpose. It is usual to give the trees 
heavy annual prunings to keep the crop down within 
easy reach of the pickers. 
The ripe coffee berry is a red fruit the size of a 
small cherry. Harvesting the fruit has to be done 
by hand, and this constitutes one of the largest items 
of expense. The berries are passed through a rude 
pulping mill, after which the seeds are spread on 
large cemented floors to dry in the sun. After be- 
coming thoroughly dry they are cleaned, graded, and 
polished, and then are ready to sack for market. 
Most of the coffees in ‘cultivation are supposed to 
belong to asingle species. 
The Liberian coffee is, however, entirely distinct ; 
the tree grows much larger and stronger, and the 
fruit and seed are also larger. Like most cultivated 
plants coffee is quite variable in character, but so 
far very little attention has been given to the selec- 
tion of improved strains. Here, as with most other 
tropical products, a great field is open for the work 
of the intelligent plant breeder. 
Diseases and Insects. — Like all other cultivated 
crops, coffee is subject to the attacks of various fungi 
and insects. The only insect enemy that has at- 
tracted wide attention is the leaf miner (Leucoptera), 
a minute, lepidopterous larva, which burrows in the 
leaf tissue, forming large, irregular, deadened areas. 
It occurs abundantly in all parts of the American 
tropics, and does very considerable injury by so 
greatly reducing the active leaf surface. When 
ready to transform, it emerges and spins a very 
   
-P-A-G-E-222
  204 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
delicate cocoon on the under side of the leaves. 
Experiments at the Cuban Experiment Station have 
shown that it is possible to kill large numbers of the 
insects when in this stage by spraying with kerosene 
emulsion. As the pupal stage lasts but a few 
days, frequent sprayings are required in order to be 
effective, and in most cases the expense will prob- 
ably be found to be too great to make the remedy 
a practical one. 
A large aphis and various scale insects sometimes 
attack coffee, but they are usually soon controlled 
by their natural enemies. 
The rust fungus (Hemileia) that has caused such 
heavy losses in the East Indies has so far not 
appeared in the American tropics, but there is a 
rust-colored leaf spot (Stilbwm) that occurs quite 
commonly and which sometimes causes considerable 
injury. The spots are sometimes confused with 
those caused by the leaf miner, but the Stilbum 
spots are always circular, not irregular, in outline, 
and in moist weather close examination will show 
them to be covered with the minute, short-stalked, 
orange-colored, fruiting bodies of the fungus. This 
disease is usually troublesome only when the coffee 
is overshaded. Thinning out the plants and re- 
moving some of the shade is the only remedy 
required. 
In some regions many coffee trees are lost from the 
attack of a fungous root rot. The disease spreads 
slowly in concentric circles, from each center of 
infection. It has not been thoroughly studied, and 
the only remedy that can be suggested would be to
-P-A-G-E-223
  CACAO 205 
ditch deeply around each such infected area, thus 
cutting off the underground spread of the fungus. 
Cacao (Theobroma Cacao) 
The cultivation of this crop is very similar to 
that of coffee, and, as a rule, it is found in the 
same general regions, but thrives best at a somewhat 
lower altitude, most of the plantations being under 
two thousand feet and some even are almost at sea 
level. Cacao requires a rather moist climate, with 
equable distribution of rainfall; the soil should be 
deep, rich, and well drained. The method of plant- 
ing is much the same as coffee, but the trees, being 
of slightly larger growth, require to be planted at a 
distance of as much as twelve or fifteen feet. In a 
few cacao-producing regions it is grown without 
shade, but generally shade trees are provided. 
The seeds from which commercial chocolate and 
cocoa are prepared are produced in large conical or 
pear-shaped, fleshy pods, which somewhat resemble 
small musk melons. They grow directly from the 
trunk and larger branches. When mature, these 
pods are cut open and the beans placed in tubs or 
vats to pass through a process of fermentation. 
After two or three days they are taken out and 
spread upon cement floors to dry. On the larger 
estates the beans are often dried by artificial heat 
with various devices, somewhat similar to those used 
for drying fruit. 
Great care and some experience is necessary in 
order to conduct the operations of fermenting and
-P-A-G-E-224
  206 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
drying properly, as the quality and market price are 
very easily injured. 
A number of well-marked varieties are in cultiva- 
tion. One known as the Creolla is probably most 
generally planted; it is a hardy, productive, red- 
seeded kind that thrives under a wide range of con- 
ditions. Some of the more delicate, white-seeded 
varieties have a finer flavor and command higher 
prices in the market. 
Cacao is subject to a considerable number of rather 
serious diseases. Thrips often do much damage to 
the young pods. Two or three different fungi cause 
serious pod rots, and other fungi cause cankers on the 
stems that greatly weaken and sometimes kill the 
trees. There is also a root-rot fungus in some re- 
gions and in Surinam the industry has been almost 
extinguished by the outbreak of a witches’-broom 
disease. 
RUBBER 
Rubber is prepared from the milky juice of a num- 
ber of species of trees and vines. Only two are of 
much importance in the American tropics. These 
are the Mexican rubber (Castélloa elastica) and the 
Brazilian rubber (Hevea Brasiliensis). So far, the 
commercial supply of rubber has mostly come from 
wild forest trees. Wasteful methods of harvesting 
which have rapidly exhausted the more accessible 
sources of supply, and the immense increase in the 
use of rubber in the arts, long since forcibly called 
attention to the necessity of producing it by agricul- 
tural methods. Much money has been expended in 
making rubber plantations, especially in southern
-P-A-G-E-225
  
  
  
    
The Mexican Rubber Tree (Custilloa elastica). 
 
-P-A-G-E-226

-P-A-G-E-227
FRUITS 207 
Mexico, and many companies of a semispeculative 
nature have been organized for this purpose. It 
requires a number of years before rubber trees reach 
the productive age. A few of the Mexican planta- 
tions are now nearing an age when they will begin 
to produce, so we will soon know more as to the 
probable outcome of these investments. 
Castilloa seems to lend itself more readily to cultu- 
ral methods than Hevea and this is the species that 
has been most planted. There is no question but 
that the tree can be grown successfully under a wide 
range of conditions. More light is needed, however, 
as to what conditions will prove best adapted to pro- 
moting a free flow of latex ; and more experience is 
needed on many other points in regard to the best 
way of managing rubber plantations. The commer- 
cial planting of other species of rubber is proving a 
success in some of the East Indies. 
It is not likely that the roseate promises contained 
in the prospectuses of the speculative rubber com- 
panies will ever be fully realized, but in view of the 
immense demand and the high prices now prevailing, 
there is every reason to hope that under conservative 
management American rubber plantations will prove 
to be profitable and the business of rubber planting 
seems destined to be greatly extended in many parts 
of the American tropics. 
FRvItTs 
Temperate Fruits 
The fruit industry has come to be an important 
one in many parts of the South. The commercial  
-P-A-G-E-228
  208 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
fruits may be roughly grouped into three classes: 
those of temperate regions, the subtropical ones, 
and those which are strictly tropical. The limits 
of this work will only admit of a brief discus- 
sion of those of chief commercial value, taking 
up first those that belong more especially to the 
temperate regions. 
Peaches (Persica vulgaris).— This is easily the 
most important of the temperate fruits for the region 
under discussion. Peaches are grown commercially 
on a large scale in many parts of the South, espe- 
cially in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Texas. Cli- 
matic conditions are sufficiently favorable for at least 
some of the races of peaches in all parts of the South- 
ern states. High lands should be chosen instead of 
low, on account of their greater freedom from late 
spring frosts. These frosts, coming after the blos- 
soms are open, frequently cause heavy losses, and 
constitute one of the most serious drawbacks to peach 
cultivation. Peaches will grow in almost any well- 
drained soil, but very rich land is not advisable, as 
it causes too rank a growth. The best lands are 
light, sandy loams that have a larger proportion of 
clay in the subsoil. Good upland cotton soils are 
usually good peach lands. 
Peach pits are generally planted in the fall, scat- 
tered five or six inches apart in about four-foot rows. 
The young trees will be large enough to bud by the 
following August. These buds remain dormant dur- 
ing the winter, and in the spring, before growth 
starts, the stock is cut back to just above the bud, 
thus forcing all the growth of the tree into the in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
FRUITS 209 
serted bud. Young, well-cared-for peach trees grow 
rapidly, so they will be ready to move to the field 
after one season’s growth. Strong-growing seed- 
lings are sometimes budded in June. After a few 
days the tops are lopped to force the bud into im- 
mediate growth, and such June buds often make 
sufficient growth to be planted the following season. 
At the South, where there is no hard freezing to 
heave out the freshly planted trees, planting may be 
done at any time during late fall, winter, or early 
spring. The usual distance between trees is about 
twenty feet each way, although some growers plant 
them considerably closer. The principal points to 
secure success in tree planting are, to see that mel- 
low ground is tramped closely about the roots and 
that the top is heavily pruned to compensate for 
the roots that are necessarily lost in transplanting. 
Care should also be taken not to expose the roots to 
undue drying by sun and wind. The young or- 
chard should receive thorough cultivation during the 
entire summer. In the cotton belt, the land be- 
tween the trees may be safely planted to cotton for 
the first two years, since the culture given to this 
crop is exactly that required by the young orchard. 
Corn is also sometimes planted in young orchards, 
but is a less desirable crop than cotton, as it grows 
tall enough to shade the small trees and draws more 
heavily on the soil moisture and fertility. On the 
advent of fall the land should be sown to rye or 
winter oats to guard against undue washing by the 
winter rains. These crops must be plowed under in 
the spring, however, and by no means be allowed to 
=
-P-A-G-E-230
  210 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
mature ; nothing is harder on a young orchard than 
the making of a crop of small grain, since it prevents 
the stirring of the ground in the spring at the time 
when such cultivation is most needed. When lands 
are not too rich, crimson clover or vetch may be 
wisely substituted for rye as a winter cover crop ; 
but these legumes add so much nitrogen to the soil 
that their continued use is not always advisable in a 
peach orchard. 
Peaches require more pruning than most other 
fruit trees. The orchard should be gone over system- 
atically every winter, shortening in and thinning out 
the limbs. During the long growing season at the 
South peaches grow so rapidly that it is best to go 
over the orchard two or three times in the summer 
to pinch back the ends of the rapidly growing shoots; 
this will promote branching and by a little care a 
symmetrical top can be formed. If no summer pinch- 
ing is done, the main limbs will grow to an inordi- 
nate length that will necessitate extra heavy winter 
pruning. 
At the South well-grown peach trees will begin to 
bear at about three years from time of planting. 
For distant shipment fruit cannot be allowed to 
fully ripen on the trees. The best stage for picking 
is after it has obtained full size and color, but two or 
three days before it begins to soften. The fruit on 
a tree cannot all be picked at once, but should be 
gone over as often as every second day in order to 
secure it all in the best condition. It should be han- 
dled very carefully to avoid all bruising. Picking 
baskets should be lined with cloth or still better fruit
-P-A-G-E-231
FRUITS 211 
should be picked in smooth buckets, and hauled direct 
to the packing house without receiving other han- 
dling. 
At the packing house the fruit is sorted into two 
or more grades, and then packed for shipment. The 
package most used at the South is a light crate, hold- 
ing six four-quart veneer baskets. If the market ‘is 
more than twenty-four hours distant, refrigerator 
transportation isalmost essential. With proper refrig- 
eration peaches may safely be shipped for four or five 
days, or even somewhat longer. To secure the best 
results it is of great importance to get the fruit into 
the cars as quickly as possible after it is picked. 
Early failures with refrigeration were largely due to 
the attempt to refrigerate fruit which was already 
overripe. Peaches are usually consigned to fruit 
dealers to be sold on commission. They are so per- 
ishable that dealers dislike to take the risk of buying 
them at the point of shipment. However, buyers visit 
the principal producing centers each season, and often 
take considerable quantities. 
At the South peaches are mostly grown for’ ship- 
ment in the fresh state. At some points canning and 
evaporating plants have been established, but these, 
as a rule, only work up the poor grades. In the more 
remote country districts peaches are still sometimes 
fermented and distilled into brandy. 
An immense number of varieties are in cultivation, 
but they can be grouped into five principal classes or 
races. First, the Persian, which includes the Craw- 
ford, and many other varieties that have been longest 
in cultivation at the North. Second, the North China 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
212 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
race, which are mostly descended from the Chinese 
Cling; this includes the Elberta and many others 
most popular in the middle South. Third, the so- 
called Spanish type, including certain kinds derived 
from Florida seedlings, which were supposed to be of 
Spanish origin. This race is of less importance than 
the other two, but is adapted to a somewhat more 
southerly region. They are mostly grown in the 
latitude of north Florida. None of these races suc- 
ceed well in the peninsula of Florida, nor in South 
Texas; for these regions two other races have re- 
cently been developed that came originally from South 
China. The Chinese Honey and its descendants are 
rather small, long, pointed peaches, with a sweet but 
somewhat insipid flavor. The Peento type are de- 
scendants from a variety of that name, which, unlike 
the Honey, is broad and flat in shape. Varieties of 
these two types can be grown throughout the orange 
belt of Florida and succeed to some extent in Cuba 
and other tropical countries. No detailed description 
of the different varieties can be attempted here, but 
the reader is referred to the Reports of the Georgia 
and Florida Horticultural Societies. 
Diseases and Insects. — The most serious fungous 
disease at the South is the brown rot (Monilia). If 
the weather is wet during the ripening season, the 
loss from this cause is liable to be very great. It is 
always worse on low, moist land and on trees that are 
making a vigorous growth. To guard against rot 
orchards should be given such treatment as will in- 
duce only a moderate growth, just enough to keep the 
trees in a healthy normal condition. Rapid growth
-P-A-G-E-233
  FRUITS 213 
in a bearing orchard is not desirable. Thorough 
spraying with Bordeaux mixture gives a large meas- 
ure of protection from rot, but in very unfavorable 
seasons, or on rankly growing trees, it cannot be de- 
pended upon to entirely prevent it. Peach foliage 
is very susceptible to injury from copper compounds, 
so that a very weak Bordeaux must be used. Two 
pounds of copper sulphate and six pounds of lime 
to a barrel of water is the formula usually recom- 
mended for peaches. To be effective, spraying must 
be given early in the spring, as soon as the blossoms 
fall. In fact, one spraying before the buds open is 
advisable. Subsequent applications will depend, to 
some extent, upon the weather. If the weather is 
wet, more spraying will be required than when dry. 
Another necessary precaution is to remove all dry, 
so-called “mummied” fruits of last year’s crop and 
destroy them, for it is on these “mummies” that the 
fungus passes the winter. 
Next in importance to the rot is the curculio, a 
small beetle which stings the young fruit and deposits 
an egg which hatches into a small, white, footless 
grub, that feeds within the tissues of the growing 
fruit, either destroying it entirely or, if the egg has 
been laid later in the season, causing it to ripen pre- 
maturely and, when cut, disclosing the rotting cavity 
in which the grub is feeding. These wormy peaches 
are well known by every one who has handled this 
crop. Adding two ounces of Paris green to the 
barrel of Bordeaux mixture that is used for the first 
spraying after the falling of the flowers will killa 
certain proportion of the adult beetles, as they feed
-P-A-G-E-234
  214 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
to some extent upon the young, tender foliage. But 
this spraying cannot be depended upon to fully pro- 
tect the crop. The beetles have a habit of falling 
from the tree when disturbed. This fact is taken 
advantage of for destroying them. Sheets are fas- 
tened over light frames that are made with an opening 
on one side so that they may be slipped about the 
trunk of the tree ; the tree is then jarred sharply, the 
beetles falling upon the sheets, where they may be 
gathered up and destroyed. This work is best done 
early in the morning, since the beetles fly too quickly 
during the heat of the day. Curculio catching should 
begin as soon as the young fruits are well formed, 
and the trees should be gone over every morning as 
long as the insects are found in any quantity. In some 
seasons they will be practically all caught in three 
weeks and at other times it will be necessary to con- 
tinue the catching almost to the time for gathering 
the fruit. This is a laborious and expensive business, 
and is not undertaken by all growers. It is, however, 
the only method by which immunity from this pest 
can be secured, and it is found to pay well by those 
who have followed it most thoroughly. 
The San José scale (Aspidiotus perniciosus) is an 
insect coming originally from China that first attracted. 
attention in this country in the neighborhood of San 
José, California. It has since spread to practically all 
fruit-growing sections, usually having been carried on 
infected nursery stock. This fact more than any- 
thing else has led to the enactment in most of the 
states of stringent laws governing the inspection of 
nurseries and the traffic in and importation of nursery

stock. ( This insect attacks practically all of the 
deciduous fruit trees and many ornamental trees and 
shrubs, covering the bark with a grayish scurfy 
coating. It is especially injurious to the peach, 
since, when present in great numbers, it quickly 
lowers the vitality of the tree, frequently killing it 
outright by the second year. Many fine orchards 
in all parts of the country have been ruined by this 
insect. For a long time entomologists were at a 
loss to determine the original home of this insect, 
as it is now so widely scattered in all parts of the 
world. Since this has finally been determined, great 
efforts have been made to find and introduce its 
natural native enemies, but so far the practical results 
obtained have not equaled the expectations that were 
warranted by the success of such importations in 
other cases. The usual methods employed for com- 
bating this most serious pest are the use of contact 
poisons for spraying and washing the trunks, or 
fumigation with hydrocyanic gas under tents. The 
latter method is cumbersome and expensive, so 
reliance is usually placed on spraying. Various 
substances have been widely recommended for this 
purpose and have been used with more or less success, 
particularly whale-oil soap and kerosene and crude 
petroleum, both in emulsionsand mechanical mixtures. 
On the whole, however, the best and safest results are 
found to follow the use of the sulphur-lime spray (see 
page 97). Two applications are best, one in the fall 
as soon as the leaves are off and another in the spring 
before the buds open. As in most spraying opera- 
tions, very thorough work is necessary, since it is
-P-A-G-E-237
  FRUITS Qi 
only those scales that are actually covered by the 
mixture that are killed. 
The next. most serious peach enemy is the root 
borer. This is the larva of a small moth which lays 
her eggs on the bark at the foot of the tree. When 
the young hatch, they bore into the bark and range 
downward, feeding on the soft layer between the 
bark and the wood. They are often numerous 
enough to do considerable damage, sometimes even 
girdling the tree and killing it outright. Many 
preventive washes have been tried with the idea of 
deterring the insect from laying her eggs on the tree, 
and it is probable that some of them are more or less 
effective; but careful experiments show that they can- 
not be relied upon. Perhaps as good a one as any is 
to paint the trunks of the trees, in early spring, 
with a heavy Bordeaux mixture, to which has been 
added six .to eight ounces of Paris green to the 
barrel. The lime of the Bordeaux mixture acts to 
some extent as a deterrent, and the Paris green will 
kill some of the newly hatched larve while attempt- 
ing to bury themselves in the bark. Another ex- 
pedient is to mound the dirt up well around the 
trunk of the trees in early spring, before the eggs 
are deposited. This forces the insect to place her 
eggs high up on the tree, where the bark is too hard 
to be easily penetrated by the young larve. After 
all these precautions have been taken, however, it is 
still necessary to go over the orchard two or three 
times each summer and dig out the borers with a 
sharp knife. ( On removing the dirt from the base of 
the tree, they can be easily located by the gum and
-P-A-G-E-238
218 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
sawdust that exudes from the mouth of their 
burrows. 
The peach yellows that has killed so many orchards 
at the North is almost unknown at the South, but a 
somewhat similar disease, known as rosette, has been 
quite destructive in restricted localities. Infected 
trees can be told at quite a distance by the yel- 
lowish color and the manner in which the leaves 
are crowded at the ends of the twigs. This, like the 
yellows, is a functional, non-parasitic disease. No 
remedy is known. Diseased trees should be promptly 
dug up and destroyed. 
Plums (Prunus sps.).— The remarks already given 
in regard to peaches will nearly all apply with equal 
force to plums, since the two crops require very 
similar conditions and management and are liable 
to the attacks of the same diseases and insects. 
If anything, plums may be planted on rather heavier 
soils than peaches. The cultivated varieties of plums 
differ much more widely than peaches, since they are 
derived from a number of distinct species. The 
Japanese plums, which are supposed to belong to 
Prunus triflora, are the most important race for the 
Southern states and include such well-known market 
kinds as Abundance, Burbank, and Kelsey. Next in 
importance come the Wild Goose class (Prunus hor- 
tulana). Following these are the native Chickasaws 
(Prunus angustifolia), many of which have been 
brought into cultivation. The European plums and 
prunes (Prunus domestica), whichare so largely grown 
in California, do not succeed well at the South, and 
are rarely found there. The many native varieties
-P-A-G-E-239
FRUITS 219 
of Northern plums (Prunus Americana and Prunus 
nigra) are also but little planted. 
A few varieties of plums root readily from cuttings, 
and one of these, the Mariana, has been extensively 
used as a stock on which to bud the other kinds. 
At the present time most commercial plum orchards 
in the South are on these stocks. 
Besides the diseases and insects discussed under 
peaches, plums are subject to another serious trouble, 
known as black knot (Plowrightia). This is a 
fungous parasite causing unsightly black, gall-like 
swellings on the twigs and branches. When these 
become numerous, they greatly sap the vitality of the 
tree, and in extreme cases even cause its death. It 
can be quite thoroughly controlled by carefully 
pruning out the diseased branches and spraying the 
tree in early spring with Bordeaux mixture in order 
to prevent new infection. 
Neither apricots nor cherries, the other two im- 
portant stone fruits, succeed well at the South. 
Apricots bloom so early as to be very subject to 
injury from late frost; while climatic conditions do 
not seem favorable to the growth of cherry trees, and 
it is useless to plant them south of Tennessee and 
Kentucky, except in the mountains and the red clay 
foothills of the Piedmont region. 
Apples (Pyrus malus).— At the South apples 
do not have the same preéminent commerciai im- 
portance as at the North, but they can be grown, 
at least for home use, in practically all parts of the 
cotton belt. A few varieties will even grow and bear 
fruit along the Gulf coast and in Florida, though  
-P-A-G-E-240
  220 THE CHIEF duit AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
they give plain indications that the surroundings are 
not congenial. 
Apples grow best on rather heavy soils, those of 
limestone origin being particularly adapted to them. 
They are sometimes budded in the same manner as 
peaches, but it is more usual to propagate them by 
root grafting. Apple seedlings are taken up when 
one year old, the roots cut into from one to three 
pieces, and the scion of the desired variety is whip- 
grafted into this piece of root. These grafts are 
planted rather deeply in nursery rows, so that the 
point of union is well covered with earth. They are 
usually allowed to grow two years in the nursery, but 
some orchardists prefer planting one-year-old trees. 
The cultivation and care of an apple orchard is 
much the same as with the peach, except that less 
pruning is required and that on strong, moist lands 
it is permissible, after three or four years, to seed the 
land down to grass or clover. 
Several hundred varieties of apples have been listed 
in catalogues, and more or less cultivated, but compar- 
atively few of these have any commercial impor- 
tance. Many of the best-known Northern varieties 
do not thrive well at the South. Of the better- 
known kinds, Red Astrakhan and Red June for early, 
and Winesap and Ben Davis for late, kinds may be 
safely planted. 
Apples are subject to the attacks of a long list of 
diseases and of insect troubles. There are borers 
which attack the roots and trunks, and cankerworms 
to destroy the leaves. The woolly aphis causes dis- 
tortions and gall-like swellings on the roots. This
-P-A-G-E-241
  FRUITS 221 
is apt to be a rather serious pest and is frequently 
introduced on the roots of young trees from the 
nursery. Such trees should never be planted. This 
trouble may be partially cured by removing the soil 
from the roots and applying a liberal application of 
ground tobacco stems and again covering with dirt. 
Everything considered, the codling moth is the 
most serious pest of the apple. This is a small brown 
moth that lays an egg in the calyx of the young apple 
just after the flower falls. The egg soon hatches 
into a minute grub that bores down into the fruit, 
usually working in or near the core. Such wormy 
apples are, of course, worthless for market. The stand- 
ard remedy is to spray thoroughly with Paris green, 
just after the flowers fall, and before the young 
fruits get heavy enough to turn down. If a drop of the 
poison spray chances to lodge in the calyx, the Paris 
green will remain there and kill the young grub as it 
tries to eat its way into the interior. 
Two sprayings should be given at intervals of a 
week or ten days and the work should be done as 
thoroughly as possible in order to make sure that 
each apple receives its drop of poisonous liquid. 
Another very serious apple trouble is the fungous 
disease known as scab (Fusicladium). This forms 
brown, unsightly blotches on the fruits and seriously 
injures their keeping qualities. It also attacks the 
leaves and the young twigs. The fungus which has 
wintered over on the twigs becomes active early in 
the spring, and if the weather is damp and rainy at 
blooming time, it may cause the blasting of the flower 
clusters and prevent the setting of fruit. Thorough
-P-A-G-E-242
222 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
spraying with Bordeaux mixture is the recognized 
remedy. To be effective this must begin early in 
the season. The first application should be given 
before the flowers open and a second as soon as the 
petals have fallen. As a rule it is not wise to spray 
plants of any kind when in full bloom as there is 
danger of interfering with pollination. Usually a 
third and fourth application should be given at in- 
tervals of ten days to two weeks. In practice Paris 
green is added to the Bordeaux mixture for all 
except the first application, the combined spray thus 
serving to prevent injury from the codling moth 
and from the cankerworm and other leaf-eating 
insects and at the same time giving protection from 
scab and other fungous troubles. 
At the South bitter rot (Spheropsis) must be 
included among the very serious apple diseases. It 
attacks the unripe fruit while still hanging on the 
tree, covering it with large blackened areas. If 
examined closely, the surface of these areas will be 
found to be more or less thickly covered with minute 
pustules that break up through the epidermis of the 
leaf. These are the fruiting bodies of the fungus 
and contain the spores by means of which the disease 
is disseminated. The same fungus also attacks the 
larger branches, killing the bark and causing sunken, 
more or less distorted areas called cankers. It is 
here that it passes the winter. The careful cutting 
out of all such centers of contagion during the 
winter together with repeated sprayings with Bor- 
deaux, as recommended for the scab, will largely pre- 
vent injury, but the disease is a very difficult one to
-P-A-G-E-243
FRUITS 223 
fully control. Some varieties are much more sub- 
ject to it than others, and only those with some 
degree of immunity should be selected for planting. 
The serious disease of pears known as blight or 
fire blight also attacks apples and often causes much 
damage by destroying the flower clusters and the 
small twigs that bear them. This is a bacterial 
disease, and the contagion is conveyed from diseased 
to healthy flowers by the bees which visit them in 
such numbers. It will be discussed more fully as 
a pear disease. No remedy can be given except to 
cut out all diseased flower clusters as soon as they 
can be detected and to see that no neglected pear 
trees are allowed to stand in or near the apple or- 
chard. 
At the South apple trees are often seriously dam- 
aged by green aphis. These are little soft-bodied 
sucking insects that multiply with exceeding rapid- 
ity. They may be often seen entirely incrusting all 
the young growing twigs. A tree so infested stops 
growing and is greatly enfeebled. Spraying with 
kerosene, either as an emulsion or as a mechanical 
mixture with water, is the usual remedy, but.it is not 
fully satisfactory. Apple foliage is easily injured by 
kerosene. The mixture cannot be used if stronger 
than ten per cent and evén then care must be used 
not to apply it too heavily. To be effective the 
spraying must be repeated at frequent intervals, 
since it is always impossible to kill all of the insects, 
and the few that are left multiply so rapidly as 
quickly to reinfest the tree. 
Apples are sometimes attacked by the San José
-P-A-G-E-244
224 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
scale, though they are less susceptible than the 
peach, pear, or plum. They are also often infested 
by another scale, the oyster-shell bark louse. The 
same line of treatment suggested for the San José 
scale on peaches will be effective for any of the scales 
found on apples. 
The apple leaf rust (G@ymnosporangium) is an- 
other disease that should be mentioned. It is a 
fungous disease causing conspicuous yellow spots on 
the leaves. On the under side of these spots clusters 
of minute horn-shaped receptacles appear that are 
filled with spores. This disease is a peculiar and 
interesting one, since the fungus which causes it 
passes through two very distinct stages. The spores 
formed on the apple leaves will not grow again on 
the apple, but if blown to a red cedar they quickly 
germinate and form small galls on the twigs, which 
the following spring develop into the unsightly 
orange-colored masses, usually known as “cedar ap- 
ples,” that are such familiar objects wherever apples 
and red cedars occur in the same neighborhood. It is 
the spores produced on these “cedar apples” that 
again infest the young apple leaves and cause the 
yellow rust spots. Cutting down all the cedar trees 
in the neighborhood of an apple orchard is the surest 
remedy for this trouble. Spraying with Bordeaux 
mixture at the time that the “cedar apples” are 
maturing spores will also give some protection. 
Many varieties of apples show a marked immunity 
from this disease. Red Astrakhan, Winesap, and 
Ben Davis are seldom or never attacked by it, while 
Red June, Jonathan, and many other varieties are
-P-A-G-E-245
FRUITS 225 
seriously injured in all regions where the red cedar 
is common. 
Pears (Pyrus sps.).— The varieties of pears mostly 
cultivated at the North are of European origin, and 
these, asa rule, do not succeed well at the South. All 
the varieties of the Oriental race, however, are per- 
fectly well adapted to Southern conditions and a few 
of them are extensively grown for market. Unlike 
the European kinds which do best on strong clay- 
loam soils, these thrive in even the lightest sands 
and can be successfully grown throughout the cotton 
belt, along the Gulf coast, and even in peninsular 
Florida. Tosucceed, however, they must be budded 
on Oriental roots. They will not thrive if propa- 
gated on European roots or on the quince. 
Some fertilizer must be used on very light soils to 
secure sufficient growth, but, as will be more fully 
explained in discussing blight, great care must be 
taken not to overfertilize. 
It is usual to give clean cultivation during the 
first two or three years. After this, custom varies ; 
some growers, especially on the heavier soils, prefer- 
ring to plant the ground to some cover crop or even 
let it grow up to grass. 
Unlike most other fruits, pears do not develop 
their best quality if allowed to hang on the tree un- 
til entirely ripe. They should be picked when fully 
grown or as soon as the seeds have hardened and be 
placed in a close dark place to ripen. The rule usu- 
ally followed in picking is to take them as soon as 
the stem will part readily from the tree when the pear 
is lifted. If allowed to tree ripen, many varieties 
Q  
-P-A-G-E-246
  226 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
become dry and tasteless, while others soften and rot 
at the core, thus becoming worthless. 
Like the apple, pears are subject to the attacks 
of the codling moth and also to ascab fungus. These 
may be controlled in the same way as suggested for 
apples by spraying with Bordeaux mixture just before 
and with Bordeaux and Paris green just after bloom- 
ing. 
San José scale attacks pears in common with the 
other deciduous fruit trees and should be treated as 
previously indicated. 
Pears are also subject to a leaf-spot fungus (Ento- 
mosporium) which does much damage by causing the 
premature falling of the leaves. Some varieties are 
very susceptible and are often completely defoliated 
by midsummer. This prevents the formation of 
fruit buds, and the crop for the following year is lost. 
Other kinds show a marked degree of immunity and 
are usually but little injured. The spraying with 
Bordeaux recommended for scab will do much to 
hold this disease in check also. 
Blight, or as it is sometimes called, fire blight; is by 
far the most serious disease of pears. It is caused 
by bacteria which attack the tender growing tissues, 
especially of the cambium, which lies between the 
bark and the wood. The stigmas of the open 
flowers are also very liable to attack and in the 
great majority of cases infection takes place in this 
way through the flowers. The usual course of the 
disease is as follows: when the sap first stirs in the 
spring on certain old blighted areas, where the disease 
has held over from the previous year, the bark
-P-A-G-E-247
FRUITS 227 
exudes drops of a sweet sticky liquid that is simply 
swarming with the blight germs. Other food being 
scarce, bees are attracted to this sticky exudation 
and become smeared with it. When they after- 
ward visit the first open flowers, they carry the 
germs, which find a favorable place of growth on the 
moist stigmas of the pistils. They multiply and 
find their way down through the soft tissues so 
rapidly that in the course of one or two days the 
entire flower looks limp and watery, and it soon 
blackens and shrivels. From the flower stem the 
disease quickly makes its way to the soft cambium of 
the fruit spur, and spreads from this downward to 
the larger limbs on which it is borne. The disease 
usually continues to spread rapidly as long as the 
tree is in an active growing condition, and it often 
happens that the disease, gaining access to a large 
limb from some small fruit spur, completely girdles 
it, and thus causes the sudden dying of all that part 
above the point of infection. If, as sometimes hap- 
pens, the diseased fruit spur springs directly from the 
main trunk, the entire top of the tree may suddenly 
die. When the trees stop growing and begin to 
harden up the new wood in the great majority of 
cases, especially on the twigs and small branches, the 
disease dies and a sharp line of demarcation begins 
to separate the dead from the living wood. On the 
trunks and larger limbs, however, there are always 
certain places where it continues to grow slowly, and 
it is by means of these “hold over” cases that 
the disease passes the winter, and starts a fresh out- 
break the following spring. The “blossom blight” 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  228 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
above described is by far the most common form, but 
the disease may also be conveyed by the bites of 
insects to the young leaves, stems, or fruits. It does 
not, however, seem to be able to pass through the 
unbroken cuticle which is nature’s protective cover- 
ing to guard against such infections. 
No remedy for this disease is known, and no 
spray or other application has been found that is of 
the slightest use in controlling it. Cultural methods, 
however, may do much to minimize the losses oc- 
casioned by it, by taking advantage of the fact 
that it spreads fastest when the tree is making the 
rankest, most vigorous growth, and that it practi- 
cally dies out as soon as that growth begins to 
harden. A pear orchard that is attacked by blight 
should be at once seeded down to grass, or some 
cover crop, and should be given phosphatic fertilizers, 
but no nitrogen, in order to induce the early harden- 
ing of the wood. Especially after the trees reach 
bearing age anything that would induce a rank, 
sappy growth should be carefully avoided. Spo- 
radic cases that occur in young trees should always 
be promptly cut out, taking care to cut well in ad- 
vance of the diseased area. In a bearing orchard 
it will do little good to attempt cutting while an 
outbreak is actively in progress, but when it is over 
the dead wood should be cut away and careful 
search made for all living “hold over” cases. These 
should be cut out with great care, and the orchard 
should be inspected frequently, with the hope of de- 
tecting and removing all of them. In starting a 
young orchard it is also wise to prune back very 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
FRUITS 229 
low, and then allow three or four leaders to form 
instead of one. This does not make as handsome 
a tree, but in case blight infests one of these leaders 
it can be cut away without losing the entire tree. 
It is also best to carefully prune off all fruit spurs 
that form on the trunk and larger limbs, thus con- 
fining the flowers, which are such a source of danger, 
to the twigs and smaller branches. There seems to 
be a certain periodicity with this disease, and in 
occasional years heavy losses will occur, notwith- 
standing all these precautions. Ordinarily, however, 
profitable crops can be secured if they are carefully 
attended to. 
The quince (Cydonia) and the loquat (Mespilus) 
are two fruits related to pears and apples that are 
considerably grown in some parts of the South, but 
neither is of much commercial importance. The ordi- 
nary, or French, quince does not thrive well, except 
in the more northern districts, but the large, coarse 
Chinese quince is at home in all parts. It is used, 
like the other, for preserving, but has quite a dis- 
tinct flavor. The loquat, or medlar, sometimes erro- 
neously called “Japan plum,” only occurs in Florida 
and along the Gulf coast. It is quite abundant in 
the neighborhood of New Orleans. As it blooms in 
the fall, and ripens its fruit in early spring, it is a 
welcome addition to the home garden in those re- 
gions where it can be grown, but it cannot endure 
much cold. It also thrives well in the tropics. 
The dwarf June berry, or service berry (Amelan- 
chier), is another little fruit belonging to the apple 
and pear family that is often found in Southern

gardens. It is locally called ‘a currant, but it does 
not compare with that favorite Northern fruit in 
flavor or usefulness. f 
Of the other small fruits strawberries and black- 
berries are the only ones that can be successfully 
grown. Raspberries, currants, gooseberries, and cran- 
berries all fail except in the mountainous districts> 
Strawberries (Fragaria 
of the South, as also in C succeed well in all parts 
ba, Porto Rico, and other 
tropical countries. They are grown extensively for 
Northern shipment, and, in fact, in certain regions 
they constitute the chief market crop. Refrigerator 
transportation must be utilized to reach points more 
than twenty-four hours distant. A great number 
of varieties are in cultivation, and various cultural 
methods are used, but the subject is too large to be 
considered in detail here. 
Blackberries (Rubus) are of much less commercial 
importance than strawberries. Some, at least, of 
them can be grown successfully in all parts of the 
Southern states. The varieties in cultivation are 
descended from a number of wild species. They 
may all be classed in two groups, the high-bush black- 
berries and the trailing blackberries. The last are 
usually called dewberries. 
Grapes (Vitis). —Some of the many kinds of grapes 
can be grown successfully in all parts of the South- 
ern states and even in favored localities in the West 
Indies. In no part of the South, however, do they 
have the same commercial importance as along the 
shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario or in California. 
Grapes will grow under a great variety of soil and

climatic conditions. Most of the kinds do best on 
strong, well-drained limestone soils and in a dry 
rather than a wet climate. Frequent rains and a 
moist, muggy atmosphere, especially as the fruit 
reaches maturity, always promote the many fungous 
diseases to which this crop is so susceptible. The 
common European practice of planting on hillsides 
too steep for cultivation to other crops is seldom fol- 
lowed in this country, not so much because grapes 
cannot be made to thrive in such locations as because 
the expense of cultivation is much greater than on 
more level land. Good drainage is, however, always 
important, and a southeast exposure, where the dew 
dries early, is to be preferred to a northern one. 
Grapes require plenty of potash and phosphoric acid, 
and where these substances are lacking they should 
be supplied in commercial fertilizers ; but nitrogenous 
manures should be avoided as they promote a ten- 
dency to disease. Vine roots seem to have a consider- 
able power of utilizing the insoluble phosphates. No 
vines grow better than those having old bones buried 
about the roots. 
Grapes are mostly propagated from cuttings, the 
young plants being planted in the vineyard when 
from one to two yearsold. They are usually planted 
at from six to eight feet apart, and the ground should 
be given frequent but shallow cultivation in order to 
always keep it clear of weeds and grass. Cover 
crops are seldom used in the vineyard, but at the 
South some kind of winter cover crop would undoubt- 
edly be of great benefit in protecting the fertility of 
the soil. The California method of training which

allows the vines to fall over on the ground will not 
answer at the South on account of the summer rains, 
but it is necessary to tie the vines either to stakes or 
tosome form of wire trellis. Everything considered, 
the horizontal three-wire trellis is to be preferred, 
since the fruit hangs under the shelter of the leaves 
and is more protected from sun and dew. 
Most kinds of grapes require heavy annual prun- 
ing in order to produce profitable crops. A number 
of different systems of pruning are in vogue, but the 
so-called long-arm renewal system is best adapted 
to Southern conditions. During the first season all 
laterals are pinched out, and the vine is trained to a 
single stem. When this reaches the height of the 
trellis, the terminal bud is pinched out to force 
branching. No further attention is required till the 
winter pruning, when all but the two best branches 
are cut away. These are tied down to the central 
wire of the trellis and are cut back to three or four 
buds in order to Neeldnt overbearing. Each of 
these buds will push a strong new shoot in the spring, 
which in most cases tall over the side wires and 
supports itself without the necessity of tying. The 
fruit is borne on these new shoots, each one producing 
an average of three to, All shoots starting 
from the lower part of the main stem should be 
pinched off. The next winter the two best shoots are 
again selected, preference being given to those start- 
ing farthest back near the old cane, and all others 
are cut away. ‘This time the bearing canes may be 
left longer than the first year and by the third year 
they may be left long enough to meet with those of

-P-A-G-E-253
  FRUITS 233 
the next vine, thus making a continuous line of bear- 
ing wood for the full length of the trellis. 
Grapes must hang on the vine till fully mature, 
as they do not ripen after gathering. Maturing at 
the South during the heat of midsummer, they do 
not keep like the Northern grape that ripens in the 
cool weather of fall, and they must be marketed 
quickly, refrigerator transportation being necessary 
for distant shipments. 
At the South grapes are mostly grown for use in 
the fresh state, but in a few sections wine making 
has become a successful industry. Many families 
also make it in a small way for home consumption. 
The kinds mostly used for wine making are the Con- 
cord, the Herbemont, and the Scuppernong. 
The varieties of cultivated grapes are very numer- 
ous and differ widely in character and adaptability to 
different cultural conditions. They are descended 
from a considerable number of wild species, and they 
are usually classified according to their botanical 
relationship. The most important that have become 
the parents of cultivated kinds are Vitis vinifera 
of Europe, Vitis Labrusca of the northeastern United 
States, Vitis cstivalis of eastern America, Vitis 
Bourquineana of the southeast (known only in 
cultivation), Vitis rotundifolia of the southeast, and. 
Vitis Linsecomit of the southwest. Besides the 
direct descendants of these different species much 
attention has been given to hybridizing, and some 
of our best varieties are multi-hybrids, combining the 
characteristics of several of these original strains. 
The name of Rogers will always be associated with
-P-A-G-E-254
  234 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
the delicious but unfortunately rather delicate kinds 
produced by combinations of the vinifera and 
Labrusca types, while 
Munson of Texas in p 
race of grapes, better the achievement of T. V. 
roducing an entirely new 
adapted than any of the 
old ones to southwestern conditions, by using the 
native post-oak grape of Texas as the foundation for 
his crosses, is one of the most notable in the entire 
history of plant breeding. A wild grape (Vitis 
Carabea) grows abundantly in many parts of the 
West Indies. It is exceedingly vigorous and the fruit 
is of fair quality. It could doubtless be used with 
equal success as the basis for a race of grapes entirely 
adapted to tropical conditions. 
The vinifera or European kinds are practically 
the only ones grown in Europe and in California. 
All of the raisin grapes and many of the best 
wine and table grapes belong here. They require 
a warm, dry climate in order to succeed well, and 
unfortunately none of them are fully successful at 
the South. In a humid climate they are very 
subject to mildew and to other diseases, and every- 
where they are exceedingly susceptible to the at- 
tacks of Phylloxera. 
The Labrusca varieties are the ones most generally 
grown in the northeastern United States, and they 
include such well-known kinds as Concord, Ca- 
tawba, and Niagara. They can be grown as far 
south as the Gulf coast, but are not fully successful 
in peninsular Florida and are probably not adapted 
to tropical conditions. They are good growers and 
are comparatively resistant to most grape disease, 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
FRUITS 235 
but at the South they prove very susceptible to root 
rot, and vineyards are apt to be short lived. 
The estivalis varieties are of comparatively little 
importance, though some of them are valuable for 
wine. Vines of this type and of the closely related 
Vitis rupestris are very resistant to the Phylloxera, 
and they have been very widely used in Europe and 
California as stocks on which to graft the susceptible 
vinifera varieties. 
The Bourquineana varieties also constitute a small 
group, but they are important at the South from 
their power of resistance to the insidious root-rot 
disease. The Delaware, everywhere so well known 
ag one of the best of American table grapes, and the 
Herbemont, which makes one of the finest American 
wines, are the two principal varieties of this class. 
The rotundifolia varieties are all natives of the 
Southeastern states and thrive best on the moist, 
sandy soils of the coast region. They are rampant 
growers, easily climbing to the top of the tallest 
forest trees. The fruit is large and juicy but thick 
skinned. It is produced in small, irregular clusters 
and not in symmetrical, compact bunches, as in the 
other races. Unlike the bunch grapes it requires 
little or no pruning, the vines being allowed to run 
at will over large arbors. The Scuppernong is the 
best-known kind. It is a light-colored grape, while 
all the other varieties are black. While of no great 
commercial importance, it is very widely planted at 
the South for home use and domestic wine making; 
in fact, no Southern home is considered complete 
without its Scuppernong arbor.  
-P-A-G-E-256

236 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
The Linsecomti varieties have all originated with 
Mr. Munson in Texas. They are especially adapted 
to southwestern conditions, though they succeed 
well in most other parts of the South. They con- 
tain some very fine table varieties. Owing to their 
wide range in season of ripening, they have con- 
siderably extended the Southern grape season. The 
adaptability of these kinds to tropical conditions has 
not yet been determined. 
Grapes are subject to a great variety of insect 
pests and fungous diseases. Owing to the impor- 
tance of the vine industry in Europe and to the fact 
that it has been three times seriously threatened 
with annihilation, owing to the importation of Ameri- 
can diseases (powdery mildew, downy mildew, and 
Phylloxera), attention was early called to these 
troubles, and they have been more exhaustively 
studied and published on than the diseases of any 
other cultivated plant. The resulting mass of liter- 
ature is so enormous as to be absolutely bewildering. 
Only the more important troubles can be touched on 
here. For practical purposes it is only necessary to 
know that most of the fungous diseases and leaf-eat- 
ing insects can be held in check by persistent spray- 
ing with Bordeaux mixture and Paris green. This 
treatment is strongly recommended wherever grapes 
are grown in the humid regions. The first spray- 
ing should always be given before the buds open. 
Powdery mildew (Uncinula) is a superficial fun- 
gus that forms a white coating over the leaves, 
fruit clusters, and young stems. It is very injuri- 
ous to the European varieties, but rarely does much     
 
-P-A-G-E-257
FRUITS 237 
damage to American kinds. Dusting with sulphur is 
a better remedy than the Bordeaux for this disease. 
Downy mildew (Plasmopera) is a far more serious 
trouble than the previous kind. This fungus grows 
within the tissues of the leaves, sending out its fruit- 
ing branches through the stomata on the under sur- 
face, where they form a delicate downy or frostlike 
coating. The affected leaves soon die and fall. 
It also attacks and rots the young fruit clusters. 
Fortunately, it can be controlled by thorough treat- 
ment with Bordeaux mixture ; in fact, it was against 
this disease that this famous remedy was first em- 
ployed. 
Black rot (Guignardia) should probably be con- 
sidered the most serious grape disease in eastern 
North America. It grows on the leaves, causing a 
conspicuous brown spotting, but its chief injury is 
to the fruit. The infested fruits blacken and shrivel 
into hard, unshapely, persistent masses, which are 
covered with prominent pustules containing the 
spores. This makes ragged, unsightly bunches that 
are unfit for market. In severe attacks, all the fruits 
on a cluster are frequently destroyed. Varieties 
differ somewhat in susceptibility, but all of the bunch 
grapes are more or less subject to attack, the rotundi- 
Jfolia type alone having any realimmunity. Thorough 
early and repeated spraying with Bordeaux, espe- 
cially if continued from year to year, will usually 
hold this disease in check, but it is notoriously diffi- 
cult to control, and careless spraying is only wasted 
labor. 
Ripe rot (Gleosporium) is another very serious
-P-A-G-E-258
  238 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
| 
trouble at the South. It attacks the fruits just as 
they are beginning to ripen, causing them to become 
discolored and often somewhat swollen. The dis- 
eased fruits are covered with pimple-like pustules, 
as in the black rot; but unlike those attacked by 
that disease, they do not dry down and persist, but 
soon soften and fall from the cluster. The disease 
often develops after the fruit is picked and while 
on its way to market; baskets of grapes that seem 
perfectly sound when packed, opening up forty-eight 
hours later in a worthless, unsalable condition. 
From the berries the fungus soon invades the stems 
of the cluster. Instead of remaining limber and 
pliable, as in healthy cl asters, such infected stems 
dry down hard and brittle, so that even the sound 
berries are easily jarred off, and the clusters, when 
they reach market, cannot be handled without shat- 
tering. It is this shattering that has given South- 
ern grapes so poor a reputation in the markets 
and has done more than anything else to make 
the industry unprofitable. Spraying with Bordeaux 
is not admissible for some weeks before the ripen- 
ing of the fruit, since it stains the clusters and 
makes them unfit for use. It therefore cannot be 
used as a remedy for this disease. The ammonia- 
cal solution of copper carbonate may be substi- 
tuted for it with some success, but it by no means 
fully prevents the wiki Training on a horizon- 
tal trellis so that the fruit is protected from the 
sun and dew by the foliage gives more relief than 
anything else, but no really successful treatment 
for controlling this disease has yet been devised, es-

  FRUITS 239 
pecially if the weather is damp and showery when 
the grapes are ripening. 
Root rot is an obscure trouble which has not been 
sufficiently studied, and its real cause is not under- 
stood. A whitening of the layers between the 
outer and inner bark is always noticeable, and the 
small roots gradually die and rot; but so far it has 
not been possible to connect the disease with any 
specific fungus. It occurs in all parts of the South, 
especially in the dry hill lands, and has been the 
cause of the early death of a great number of vine- 
yards. The rotundifolia grapes seem to be entirely 
immune to this disease. The Bowrquineana varieties, 
while not fully immune, show a pronounced power 
of resistance, while all the other classes are about 
equally susceptible. It is probable that grafting 
these other kinds on some strong-growing, resistant 
kind like the Herbemont would do much to obviate 
this trouble and to prolong the life of Southern vine- 
yards. The Delaware, although a slow grower and 
usually considered delicate, has a pronounced power 
of resistance, and in many parts of the South it will 
continue to live and bear crops long after the Con- 
cord, Ives, and other strong- sean kinds have been 
entirely destroyed. 
The Phylloxera is a plant louse that occurs in two 
forms: one causing small galls on the leaves, and the 
other living on and causing distortions of the roots. 
It is the root form that does most damage and causes 
the death of susceptible kinds. Itis a native Ameri- 
can insect, and all the American species of grapes 
have developed a greater or less immunity to it; so
-P-A-G-E-260
  240 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
that while it may be able to live on them, it causes 
but little injury. The European vinifera varieties 
are all, however, very susceptible, and to grow them 
successfully where the Phylloxera occurs, they must 
be grafted on roots of howe resistant American kind. 
This is now very widely done in both Europe and 
California. None of the kinds usually grown at the 
South are materially injured by this insect. 
The great number of leaf-eating grape insects can 
all be more or less successfully controlled by the use 
of Paris green, which is best applied in connection 
with the Bordeaux-mixture sprays. 
Persimmons (Diospyros).— The Japanese persim- 
mon is another fruit of some importance that grows 
well in nearly all parts of the South. It is of rather 
recent introduction and so far has been slow in 
finding a place in the markets. The demand for 
it is, however, slowly increasing, and as it is of really 
high quality and keeps and ships well it will doubt- 
less ultimately become one of the important com- 
mercial fruits. The trees are not hardy at the 
North, and they are sometimes injured in the South 
by exceptionally cold winters or especially by late 
cold snaps in the spring. Methods of cultivation 
are much the same as for as the peach though much 
less pruning is required. As the trees are slow 
growers they may be set as close as twelve or fifteen 
feet. There has been much confusion in regard to 
varieties and varietal names. About a dozen kinds 
are now in more or less general cultivation and can 
be secured of the leading Southern nurseries. The 
trees are sometimes injured by a serious blight, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  FRUITS 241 
it has not been sufficiently studied to determine the 
real nature of the disease nor to suggest a remedy. 
A leaf disease also occurs, but on the whole this fruit 
is unusually free from serious troubles. 
The native wild persimmons, so common through- 
out the South, are gathered and shipped to market 
from some sections. During recent years some 
attention has been given to selecting the best of 
these and bringing them into cultivation, but as yet 
this has not passed the experimental stage. 
Subtropical Fruits 
The various citrus fruits easily overshadow all 
the others that can properly be classed as sub- 
tropical. Of these oranges, pomelos (grape fruit), 
lemons, limes, and citrons are of most importance. 
Other subtropical fruits are the fig, pomegranate, and 
olive. 
Figs (Ficus). — The fig must be classed as sub- 
tropical, although when in the dormant condition the 
tree will stand considerable cold. It can be grown 
with some success as far north as central Alabama 
and Mississippi, for although at this latitude fre- 
quently frozen to the ground by hard winters it 
sprouts readily from the roots and often bears fruit 
on these new shoots the first season. 
The fig will grow on a great variety of soils, but if 
not naturally rich they should be well fertilized. 
It has a shallow rooting habit, and only very shallow 
cultivation should be given after the trees gain 
much size. Deep plowing is very detrimental, In 
fact, at the South the ideal location for figs is found 
R
-P-A-G-E-262
  | 
242 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
in the hard-tramped, clean-swept dooryard, where 
they receive no cultivation whatever, but where no 
grass or weeds are allowed to grow and where they 
are constantly enriched by ashes, soapsuds, etc. 
Figs always thrive admirably in dooryards, but 
there have been many failures when the attempt 
has been made to grow them under orchard con- 
ditions. 
The fig, while widely grown at the South for family 
use, has never gained much commercial importance. 
The fresh fruit, ripening as it does during the period 
of midsummer rains, is too delicate for shipment 
under ordinary methods. Experiments have shown 
that with very careful handling it can be successfully 
shipped under refrigeration, but fresh figs are practi- 
cally unknown in the Northern markets, and there is 
consequently no pressing demand for them. By proper 
effort a profitable trade in them could unquestionably 
be established, for no fruit is more keenly relished by 
those who have learned to know it. There is a lim- 
ited industry in canning and preserving figs at a few 
points in the South. So far, very high prices have 
been maintained for these goods, and the demand for 
them is, consequently, not as great as it would other- 
wise be. It is an industry that is capable of very 
considerable extension. No commercial dried figs are 
made at the South, since climatic conditions are unfa- 
vorable and the varieties best adapted to drying do 
not thrive well. 
The number of varieties known in different coun- 
tries is very large, but only a few seem to succeed 
well at the South. Of these Celeste and Green
-P-A-G-E-263
FRUITS 243 
Ischia are the best for general planting. The Celeste 
is a small fig, but very sweet and delicious, and the 
tree is exceedingly hardy and productive. It is more 
planted than all the other kinds combined. It is an 
early fig, ripening during July. The Green Ischia is 
somewhat larger and later, ripening in August and 
September, thus making a desirable succession. It is 
of high quality and seems to be equally as hardy and 
productive as the Celeste. It is comparatively little 
known, but deserves to be much more widely planted. 
None of the varieties grown at the South produce fer- 
tile seed, since they all belong to the class that pro- 
duces fruit without pollenization. The wild pollen- 
bearing Capri fig, with its curious insect parasites, 
which convey the pollen to the hidden pistillate 
flowers, are therefore not needed. All the figs are 
readily propagated by means of cuttings. 
Nematode root galls (Heterodera) constitute by 
far the worst disease of the fig. These trees are par- 
ticularly susceptible to the attacks of this pest, which 
occurs so abundantly in all the sandier lands at the 
South, and it is probably responsible for most of 
the failures that have occurred with figs. The in- 
fested roots soon rot away, and the tree quickly 
loses vigor and finally dies. No practicable remedy 
is known. If nothing whatever is allowed to grow 
on the land for eighteen months, the nematodes will 
be exterminated by starvation. This probably ac- 
counts for the comparative immunity of trees grown 
under dooryard conditions. 
The fig rust (Uredo fict) and another leaf disease 
(caused by Cercospora Bolleana) often do consider-  
-P-A-G-E-264
  244 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
able harm by defoliating the trees. These may both 
be kept in check by occasional spraying with Bor- 
deaux mixture. 
A stem borer is troublesome in Louisiana, and one 
of the native scale insects seriously injures the fig in 
Cuba. Neither insect has received much study. 
Pomegranate (Punica). — This fruit has about the 
same range as the fig. The small amount of pulp 
surrounding the seeds contains a pleasant acid, and 
they are often used for making a cooling drink, but 
the fruit has no commercial importance. It is fre- 
quently grown in family gardens, but quite as much 
as an ornament as for its fruit. 
Olives (Olea). — The olive is fairly hardy to cold 
and will grow and bear in the latitude of the Gulf 
coast. It has, however, been but little planted, and 
' whether it can ever be of commercial importance is 
doubtful, as the climate does not seem to be well 
suited to it. The tree grows well in the West 
Indies. Some seen at Hope Gardens, Jamaica, fifteen 
years old, were thirty feet high, but for some un- 
known cause they had never borne fruit. The fact 
that it is not found in old Cuban gardens indicates 
that it will not succeed there, since it must have 
been early introduced by the Spaniards. 
Oranges (Citrus aurantium and C. nobilis). — 
Oranges, while in reality tropical evergreens, are 
able to endure light frosts without injury, especially 
if in a half dormant condition, and they are, there- 
fore, classed among the subtropical fruits. They 
are grown as far north as New Orleans and the 
Gulf coast of Mississippi and Alabama; but in this

Oranges. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266

-P-A-G-E-267
  FRUITS 245 
latitude they are frequently injured by cold, and 
every few winters the trees are frozen to the ground. 
Sometimes in such cases they sprout again from the 
roots, but often they are killed outright. Even in 
northern peninsular Florida the orange industry, 
which was once so important, has been ruined by 
occasional severe winters, so that at the present time 
commercial orange growing in the southern United. 
States is principally confined to the southern third 
of the Florida peninsula. Here it is a very impor- 
tant and growing industry, but the total output 
from the state is now less than it was before the 
disastrous freeze of 1894, and it is far less than from 
the great orange-growing district of California. 
The orange is at home in tropical countries, and 
it occurs abundantly in a half-wild state in all parts 
of the West Indies and Central America. Until 
recently, however, its commercial importance has 
not been realized in these countries, and its cultiva- 
tion has received but little attention. Since the 
great freeze in Florida, and especially since the 
Spanish-American war, the possibilities of the busi- 
ness in regions absolutely free from frost has begun 
to attract the attention of enterprising Americans, 
and there are now considerable commercial plant- 
ings in Cuba, Porto Rico, and Jamaica. 
The orange will grow and thrive on a great va- 
riety of soils and under most diverse climatic condi- 
tions. To secure a fruit that will keep and carry 
well, however, fairly dry weather is necessary dur- 
ing the ripening season, and it is the general consen- 
sus of opinion that fruit grown on rather light, 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
246 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
| 
sandy soils carries better and is juicier and richer in 
flavor than that on heavy lands. The trees, too, are 
considered to be healthier and freer from foot rot on 
light, well-drained soils. In such locations, however, 
oranges require the liberal use of fertilizers, and 
their proper application taxes the skill of the 
grower to the utmost. Nowhere has the use and 
effect of fertilizers been more closely studied than by 
the Florida orange growers. While there is still 
much difference of opinion among them as to minor 
details, all are in agreement as to the main facts, 
which are: — 
First, that abundant applications of potash are 
necessary to secure heavy, juicy fruit of high flavor 
and good keeping quality. It also seems to add to 
the vigor and disease-resisting power of the tree. If 
used too freely, the fruit may be a little too acid, but 
no other bad results will follow. 
Second, phosphoric acid is also necessary, but in the 
case of the orange it seems to be less important than 
potash. It seems to induce greater fruitfulness, and 
no harmful results are likely to follow, even from its 
excessive use. 
Third, while potash and phosphoric acid may be 
used freely with only good results, great care must be 
exercised in the use of nitrogen. If this element is 
not present in sufficient quantity, the leaves will be 
small and yellow, the tree will lack vigor, and the 
fruit will be small and poor. If too much is used, 
the leaves will be dark green and very large, wood 
growth will be stimulated at the expense of fruit- 
fulness, and the fruit will be coarse, thick skinned,
-P-A-G-E-269
  FRUITS 247 
and of poor keeping quality. Ifused in great excess, 
a serious disease known as “die back” will be in- 
duced, from the effect of which the tree may never 
completely recover. The source of the nitrogen used 
seems, too, to be a factor of importance. Stable ma- 
nure should never be used in the orange orchard, and 
other organic sources of nitrogen, like cotton-seed 
meal and dried blood, are more dangerous than the 
mineral salts, like nitrate of soda and sulphate of 
ammonia. Even leguminous cover crops must be 
used with caution as their continued use in connec- 
tion with other fertilizers has been known to occasion 
“die back.” No hard and fast rule can be given 
governing the use of nitrogen in the orange orchard. 
The trees should be carefully watched and should 
be fed with it according to their evident needs. The 
amount to use will vary from time to time with the 
condition of the trees and of the weather. More 
can be used safely during the winter and in dry sea- 
sons than during wet midsummer weather, but it is 
always the part of safety to under rather than over 
feed with this substance. The total amount of fer- 
tilizer used by the Florida growers is very large. It 
may reach as much as fifty or even a hundred 
pounds per tree in the case of large old trees that are 
in heavy bearing, but young trees during the first 
year do not receive more than from one to five 
pounds. It is best to divide the amount to be used 
for the year into at least two applications, and some 
growers prefer as many as three or four, especially 
for the nitrogenous part of the fertilizer. Expe- 
rience with fertilizers in the islands is not yet very

| 
extended. So far it has been used in much less 
quantity than in Florida. Where heavy applications 
are required, the same precautions as in Florida will 
doubtless be necessary. Many of the earliest com- 
mercial plantings in these countries were made on 
rich, heavy sugar and banana lands with the idea that 
no fertilizers would be needed. It now seems prob- 
able, however, that the quality of fruit produced in 
such locations will not be such as to compete with 
that produced on lighter soils with intelligent fer- 
tilization and that the cost will really be greater, 
owing to the greater expense of cultivation in heavy 
lands. 
Formerly nearly all oranges were grown on natural 
or so-called seedling trees. Now, as with most other 
fruits, commercial orchards are all planted with 
budded trees of named varieties. A considerable 
number of different stocks have been used on which 
to bud oranges and the other citrus fruits, and there 
is still considerable difference of opinion in regard to 
this very important question. The great bulk of the 
trees are, however, now grown on either sour orange, 
rough lemon, or Citrus trifoliata roots, although 
sweet seedlings (for soils not subject to foot rot) and 
pomelo seedlings both have their advocates. The 
trifoliata stocks are mostly used in the northern part 
of the orange belt, since their deciduous nature seems 
to check winter growth, rendering the trees more nearly 
dormant, and therefore more resistant to cold. Trees 
on this stock do not grow as rapidly as on the others, 
and some claim that this partial dwarfing makes the 
fruit thinner skinned and better in quality. The
-P-A-G-E-271
FRUITS 249 
rough lemon is a favorite stock with the nurserymen 
because it transplants easily and the young trees grow 
very rapidly. This rapid growth tends to make 
the first crops of fruit coarse and poor in quality, but 
this defect is remedied as the trees come into full 
bearing. Itis probably one of the best stocks to use 
for light soils, especially in regions where there is 
little danger from frost. It is the general opinion, 
however, that this stock is not well adapted to heavy 
lands. The sour orange thrives in a great variety 
of soils, and it will undoubtedly stand more water 
and other unfavorable conditions than any of the 
others. It is very resistant to foot rot and is nat- 
urally very long lived. While trees budded on it 
do not grow quite as fast as on the rough lemon, it is 
greatly to be preferred on heavy lands, and on the 
whole it is probably the safest stock for general 
planting. 
There is some diversity of opinion as to the best 
age at which to move orange trees from the nursery 
to the orchard. Many planters prefer large, heavy, 
two- or even three-year-old trees, and it is probably 
true that such trees give better results than in the 
case of most deciduous fruits. Everything consid- 
ered, however, a well-grown tree that is from twelve 
to eighteen months from the bud will be more satis- 
factory and can be handled more easily and cheaply 
than the older, larger ones. Two- and three-year-old 
nursery trees are only too often the culls that did not 
make sufficient growth to be sold as yearlings. It is 
a great mistake, however, to plant a very small orange 
tree, or one so young that the wood is not thoroughly
-P-A-G-E-272
    250 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
hardened. In Florida orange trees are usually 
planted in winter, when in the most nearly dormant 
condition. They can then be handled much the same 
as deciduous fruit trees. They can, however, be 
successfully planted in summer by selecting a time 
when the growth is not active, but more care is re- 
quired than in the dormant winter season. In moy- 
ing orange trees they should always be heavily 
pruned, and if the weather is dry it is wise to clip 
off half of each remaining leaf with the shears in 
order to still further check transpiration. If the 
trees are entirely defoliated, the tendency is for 
new shoots to start too quickly before there is suf- 
ficient root development to support them. In the 
tropics it is often necessary to cut the roots about 
the young trees a week or ten’ days before moving 
them in order to check growth and render them 
sufficiently dormant, so that they can be handled 
with safety. 
The proper handling, grading, and packing of 
oranges for market are matters of the greatest 
importance since the price received is largely de- 
pendent on the care and skill used. This fact seems 
to be more generally and fully appreciated by the 
California growers than by those in the South. 
Much of the reputation of California fruits has come 
from the fact that they are uniformly so well packed. 
Oranges for shipment should always be cut from the 
tree with the small clippers used for this purpose. 
If they are pulled, the skin will be broken at the 
point of attachment to the stem and decay is likely 
to follow. When first picked, the rind of the orange
-P-A-G-E-273
FRUITS 251 
is turgid and full of sap. In this condition it is 
easily bruised, so the fruit should be handled with 
much care and it should be “cured” by lying ex- 
posed to the air in the packing house for two or 
three days until this surplus moisture has evaporated 
and the rind becomes somewhat limp and pliable. 
It can now be handled and pressed closely in the 
boxes without injury. If the fruit is packed direct 
from the tree without curing, it will be more or less 
bruised in handling; the moisture given off will 
dampen the wrapping paper, thus favoring decay; 
and the shrinking of the fruit will make the box 
seem slack filled. Much of the complaint of or- 
anges arriving in bad order comes from the care- 
less disregard of this important matter of curing 
before packing. After the fruit has lain in the cur- 
ing boxes long enough to handle well it is graded 
into brights and russets and the unmarketable culls 
are rejected. Each class is now assorted into certain 
standard sizes for convenience in packing. This is 
best and most accurately done by the use of some of 
the mechanical sizers now on the market. The 
oranges are rolled through the machine, the different 
sizes passing through different openings, and falling 
in separate receivers. Each orange is now wrapped 
in tissue paper that is usually marked with the dis- 
tinctive brand or trade mark of the owner, and they 
are packed in the boxes, each size according to some 
definite plan that will bring them out evenly and 
smoothly at the top of the box. The box should be 
full enough so that considerable pressure is necessary 
in nailing on the cover. Small growers do not 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  252 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
always pack their own fruit. It is often bought on 
the tree by shippers who run their own packing 
houses, or if not sold, it may be taken to some cen- 
tral codperative packing house. 
A large number of varieties are in cultivation, but 
for a detailed discussion of them the reader must 
consult some of the really excellent special works on 
orange culture. Two quite distinct groups may be 
recognized: the common or round orange (Citrus 
aurantium) and the Mandarin or kid-glove orange 
(Citrus nobilis). The Washington navel, which is 
the seedless orange so extensively grown in California, 
does not succeed well in Florida, and whether or not 
it will be a success in the West Indies is still an 
open question. In Florida each section has its fa- 
vorite kinds, many of which have been selected from 
among the best native seedlings. In the compara- 
tively new orange regions of the West Indies it is 
still difficult to decide what varieties it will be most 
profitable to plant. Many very excellent seedlings 
occur in these countries and it is probable that in 
the future each island may develop its own market 
varieties by selecting its best native seedlings. 
The orange is subject to a considerable number of 
serious diseases and insect pests, only the more im- 
portant of which can be briefly considered. 
The “die back” has already been mentioned in the 
discussion of fertilizers. It is a functional trouble not 
caused by any parasitic organisms but resulting from 
some derangement of nutrition. It is usually caused 
by overstimulation with nitrogenous fertilizers. The 
leaves, which are at first very large and dark green,
-P-A-G-E-275
  
FRUITS 253 
become crumpled and mottled with yellow, the twigs 
exude drops of gum, and these symptoms are fol- 
lowed by the more or less extensive dying back of | 
the branches. In the case of severe attacks the tree 
may ultimately die, but more often it lingers on in an 
unthrifty and unprofitable condition. Such trees may 
ultimately be restored to health by pruning out the 
diseased wood and giving great care to fertilizing and 
cultivation in order to carefully avoid the exciting 
cause. Whenan orchard is seen to be threatened with 
“die back,” cultivation should be stopped at once so 
that the grass may grow and thus take up some of the 
excess of nitrogen, and some benefit may be derived 
from additional applications of potash and acid phos- 
phate, which would tend to restore a proper balance 
in the food supply. 
Foot rot, or mal di gomma, as it is called by the 
Italians on account of the flow of gum which accom- 
panies it, is an obscure disease, the cause of which 
has not been clearly ascertained. It causes the dy- 
ing of more or less extensive areas of the bark usu- 
ally at or near the crown of the tree. As a rule it is 
worse on wet, heavy lands. The sweet orange, when 
on its own roots, is particularly susceptible to this 
disease, while the sour orange is quite resistant. 
The disease often girdles and kills the trees, but it is 
by no means always fatal, and old trees are often 
seen still fairly thrifty and bearing heavy crops while 
their bases are badly scarred by old attacks of this 
disease. Serious losses can usually be avoided by 
giving good drainage and especially by planting 
trees budded on sour orange roots.
-P-A-G-E-276
254 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
Any injury to an orange tree is apt to result ina 
flow of gum. As we have séen, it is a symptom in 
both of the above diseases. There are other obscure 
diseases of the orange in various countries that are 
accompanied by the exudation of gum. These are 
collectively known under the name of “ gummosis,” 
but none of them have been sufficiently studied to be 
really understood. 
Scab (Cladosporium) is a fungous disease causing 
blisters and distortions on the leaves and young 
fruits of lemons and sour oranges. It does not attack 
the sweet orange and usually does no material harm 
to grape fruit. Sour orange seedlings in the nursery 
are often so badly attacked by it as to retard their 
growth and leave them in poor condition for budding. 
It can be successfully prevented by spraying with 
Bordeaux mixture. 
Sooty mold (Fumago Citri, often erroneously called 
Meliola Citri) is a fungus forming a black, crustlike 
coating on the fruit and leaves. It is not a parasite, 
and is by no means confined to the orange, but it is a 
“honey dew” fungus growing on the sweet ex- 
udations of certain aphids and scale insects. It 
greatly injures the appearance, quality, and market 
value of the fruit, and if abundant lowers the vitality 
of the tree by obstructing the functions of the leaves. 
It can be entirely prevented by keeping the trees 
clear of the insects which furnish its food supply. 
This, however, is often not an easy matter. 
The rust mite (Phytoptus) is very abundant in the 
West Indies and Florida. It is nota true insect, but 
is related to the spiders and is so small as to be in-
-P-A-G-E-277
  FRUITS 255 
visible without the aid of a strong pocket magnifier. 
It scarifies the surface of the leaves, young twigs, 
and the fruits, causing blackish thickenings and 
discoloration of the leaves and twigs and a peculiar 
bronzing or russeting of the fruit. These “ russet” 
oranges are well known to the trade and by many 
are supposed, like russet apples, to represent a distinct 
variety. This is not the case since all varieties 
become “russets”” when attacked by the rust mite. 
The damage is entirely external and does not injure 
the flavor of the fruit. In fact, many people believe 
that the russets are the sweetest. They do not look 
as well, however, and “russets” always bring from 
fifty.cents to a dollar a box less than “ brights” of 
the same grade. This mite, like most others of its 
class, is very susceptible to sulphur fumes. It can 
be quite successfully controlled by dusting the trees 
with sulphur, or better still spraying with water 
containing a little flour paste and flowers of sulphur 
in suspension. Spraying with sulphide of potash is 
also very effective, but the effect is less lasting. The 
treatment should begin very early in the season and 
should be continued from year to year. 
Scale insects of various kinds are among the most 
troublesome pests of the orange. There are aconsider- 
able number of species, but they cannot be considered 
separately here. When present in considerable num- 
bers on the trunks, branches, or leaves, they greatly 
reduce the vitality and productiveness of the tree. 
Young trees may even be killed outright. The fruit, 
too, is much disfigured when covered by scales. Very 
fortunately most of the scale insects have numerous
-P-A-G-E-278
  256 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
natural enemies that aid materially in holding them 
in check. They are attacked by minute Hymenop- 
terous parasites, are eaten greedily by various species 
of ladybirds ( Coccinellide) and by certain predaceous 
Lepidopterous larvie, and in moist regions they are 
frequently destroyed by various insectivorous fungi. 
In fact, it may almost be considered a rule that in its 
native country each scale insect has developed so 
many natural enemies that under normal conditions 
it is kept so closely under control as to do but little 
real damage. Sometimes, however, changes in weather 
conditions or in other factors favor the scales at the 
expense of their enemies with disastrous results. 
Most of the worst outbreaks have occurred when scales 
have been accidentally al from one country to 
another and have thus been able to escape their 
natural enemies. <A striking instance of this kind 
was the outbreak of the cottony-cushion scale that 
at one time suddenly threater ed to extinguish the 
California orange industry. The absolute destruction 
of this scale which followed so promptly after the intro- 
duction of its natural enemy, the Australian ladybird 
(Vedalia), was one of the most spectacular triumphs 
of modern economic entomology. Aside from this 
introduction of natural enemies two lines of treatment 
are recognized for scale insects: spraying with caustic 
contact poisons like kerosene emulsion, whale-oil soap, 
or the rosin-lime mixtures, or fumigating with hydro- 
cyanic-acid gas. Spraying is much more difficult 
and unsatisfactory than with deciduous trees, and 
the fumigation is costly and unless done with 
great care dangerous. Both treatments have the
-P-A-G-E-279
FRUITS 257 
great disadvantage of destroying our friends the scale 
parasites along with the scales. Except in cases of 
extreme necessity it is probably unwise to attempt 
the treatment of entire orchards for scale. Great 
care should be taken in making new plantings to 
avoid trees from infested nurseries, since this is the 
way in which this trouble is usually introduced. 
Close watch should be kept, and individual trees 
should be promptly treated as soon as scales threaten 
injury. In this way and by giving good cultivation 
and general care, expensive general spraying or 
fumigation, with its wholesale destruction of the 
useful scale parasites, may usually beavoided. Scale 
insects seem to multiply faster and do much more 
damage on feeble, slow-growing trees than on vigorous 
ones. The greater vigor of growth of young trees 
on rough lemon roots is thought by some to make 
them less susceptible to scale than when budded on 
the sour orange. 
The white fly (Aleurodes) is an insect closely re- 
lated to the scales. At the present time in Florida 
it is more feared than all the other orange pests com- 
bined, since its natural enemies have failed to hold it 
in check and none of the usual remedies seem capable 
of satisfactorily combating it. It is always accom- 
panied by the sooty mold, which adds greatly to 
the injury it occasions. It also occurs in Cuba, as 
specimens of it have been collected there, but so far 
it is not in sufficient numbers to prove injurious or 
to attract attention. Whether this practical im- 
munity is due to the presence of more active natural 
enemies has not been determined. The closely re- 
8s 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
      
  258 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
lated guava fly is fairly abundant in Cuba, but it is so 
freely attacked by a red fungus (Ashersonia) and 
other parasites that it is seldom injurious. 
In Cuba a grayish green beetle (Pachneeus litus) 
belonging to the curculios is very abundant and does 
considerable damage by eating the young orange 
foliage. This, however, is insignificant compared 
to the injury caused by the larve to the roots. 
Eggs are laid on the leaves, which soon hatch, when 
the minute grub falls to the ground, which it at once 
enters and begins feeding on the bark of the roots. 
It develops into a white, footless grub about half an 
inch long, which remains underground till the close 
of the winter dry season, when it pupates, a fresh 
crop of beetles emerging with the first spring rains. 
They sometimes occur in enormous numbers, more 
than a hundred having been found on the roots of a 
single small tree, and it really constitutes one of the 
most serious drawbacks to orange cultivation in the 
island. The presence of these grubs at the roots is 
soon indicated by the arrested growth and the yel- 
lowing of the foliage. Many trees have been killed 
outright, but as a general rule they partially re- 
cover during the rainy season. Continued attacks, 
however, greatly retard growth and prevent fruit- 
fulness. Owing to its underground feeding habit, it 
is very difficult to combat this insect in the larval 
stage. Before the studies made by the Cuban Ex- 
periment Station the connection between the root 
grub and the green beetle was not suspected. Now 
that its life history is known it is comparatively easy to 
control it by destroying the beetles. On small trees
-P-A-G-E-281
  ' FRUITS 259 
they may be easily picked off by hand, but it is bet- 
ter to take advantage of the fact that like most of 
their relatives they fall to the ground when jarred 
or otherwise disturbed. Jarring them onto a sheet 
stretched over a light frame, such as has been de- 
scribed for the peach curculio, is the most effective 
method of combating this pest. Spraying with Paris 
green is also useful, but it cannot be fully relied on, 
since the beetles, as a rule, only feed on the youngest 
foliage, and very frequent spraying would be neces- 
sary to keep all the young growth effectively poi- 
soned. So far as known this insect is confined to 
Cuba. Another very similar one is abundant in 
Porto Rico, feeding on orange foliage, but its life 
history has not been studied and its larval habit is 
not known. In Jamaica a much larger and showier 
curculio (Prepodes vittata) does almost exactly the 
same damage as the Cuban insect, and it has been 
one of the chief reasons for the practical failure 
of commercial orange planting in that island. It 
could doubtless be controlled by the same means that 
is being found effective in Cuba. 
Various species of ants are serious enemies of the 
orange in some of the tropical countries. Differ- 
ent species of the large leaf-cutting ants (Atta) 
that are known as “bibijaguas” in Cuba do much 
damage in that island and also in parts of Mexico 
and Central America, but they are not troublesome 
in Jamaica and Port Rico. A large tree may be 
entirely defoliated by a horde of these marauders in 
a single night. They live in underground cavities 
in large “ant-hills” and send out their marching
-P-A-G-E-282
  260 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
columns to great distances in search of foliage that 
is just to their liking. This they do not eat, but 
they cut it up in small pieces and pack it away in 
their underground chambers, where it becomes cov- 
ered with a peculiar fungous growth on which the ants 
feed. It is necessary to search for and destroy all 
these nests in the neighborhood of orange orchards. 
This is usually done either by pumping in sulphur 
fumes or by the use of carbon disulphide. Killing 
“bibijaguas,” however, requires constant attention, 
since the queens swarm at intervals and scatter out 
in order to establish new nests. Trees may be tem- 
porarily protected from leaf-cutting ants by tying 
a bit of loose cotton around the trunk or by paint- 
ing on a ring of the sticky material known to the 
trade as “tree tanglefoot.” This is the same ma- 
terial used in making sticky fly paper. It will 
remain soft enough to prevent the ants from cross- 
ing for a number of days. 
Another much smaller ant (Solenopsis), known 
locally as “‘hormega brava” on account of its vicious 
sting, does considerable damage in Port Rico and 
some parts of Cuba by eating holes in the bark of 
young trees in order to induce a flow of gum. They 
also bite and destroy the very young twigs. These 
ants make large shallow nests near the surface of the 
ground, and great numbers of them can be destroyed 
by opening these nests with the hoe and sprinkling 
them with kerosene or rosin-lime mixture. A ten 
per cent solution of creolin is also useful. 
Pomelos (Citrus decumana).—The pomelo, or 
grape fruit, is very closely related to the orange, not
-P-A-G-E-283
  FRUITS 261 
only botanically but in methods of growth and culti- 
vation, and it is subject to the same diseases and insect 
pests. All that has been said on these heads under 
oranges will, therefore, apply equally to this fruit. 
The tree is a rather stronger grower than the orange 
and tends to come into productive bearing a little 
younger. The fruit, too, is less delicate and bears 
handling and shipping better. It will hang on the 
tree after ripening and keep in good condition 
for marketing much longer than the orange. It is 
only recently that it has been extensively introduced 
in the markets, andits use is still somewhat limited; 
but the demand is rapidly growing and it bids fair 
to soon rival the orange in commercial importance. 
Not much can be said as to varieties at the present 
time. Marsh seedless is probably being more planted 
than any other, although it is only medium in size 
and a little harsh in flavor. It is not absolutely 
seedless as each fruit usually contains three or four 
seeds, but most of the other kinds have forty or 
fifty or more. Just how much of a factor this 
seedless feature will prove to be in the market can- 
not yet be determined. The native seedlings found 
in Cuba are of a rather different type from those of 
Florida, from which the present market kinds have 
mostly been selected. The fruit is sweeter and has 
less of the distinctive grape-fruit bitter. The trees, too, 
are of amore upright growth. The best of these seed- 
lings are very delicious, having a peculiar sprightly, 
vinous flavor that is greatly relished by all who try 
them. They are so mild as to be eaten from the 
hand, like the orange. One variety of this type was
-P-A-G-E-284
  262 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
introduced to the trade some years ago under the name 
of Royal. Itis still listed in the nursery catalogues, 
but it does not seem to have attracted much atten- 
tion and is not widely planted. Other kinds of this 
class are locally just beginning to receive attention. 
‘In the Isle of Pines, in particular, one has been 
selected and planted which is being very favorably 
received in the market, and it seems probable that 
these “sweet grape fruit” will soon find a recognized 
place in the markets by the side of the ordinary 
bitter ones. 
Lemons (Citrus Limonum).— The lemon will not 
bear as much cold as the orange, so that its cultiva- 
tion is confined to regions that are practically free 
from frosts. Although closely related to the orange, 
the tree is of somewhat different habit and requires 
much more pruning to keep it in productive condi- 
tion. It has also more of a continuous bearing 
habit, ripe fruit, half-grown fruit, and flowers being 
frequently found on the tree at the same time, which, 
contrary to popular belief, is rarely the case with the 
orange. It grows and bears well in south Florida, 
as also in the West Indies, but so far the lemon in- 
dustry has attained no commercial importance in 
these regions, largely on account of the difficulty 
that has been found in curing them so‘that they will 
keep well, and thus be able to compete with the 
foreign and California product. Lemons have to be 
picked green and then house ripened or cured. 
Some large plantings are now being made in Cuba, 
and an earnest attempt will doubtless be made to 
solve this difficulty. The Villa Franca is the princi-

FRUITS 263 
pal market variety. In a general way lemons are 
subject to the same diseases and insects as oranges. 
They are, however, very susceptible to scab, and 
lemon orchards will have to be sprayed with Bor- 
deaux mixture to secure smooth, marketable fruit. 
Limes ( Citrus Limetta). — Although closely related 
to lemons, botanically and in the purposes for which 
they are used, limes are really quite distinct. They 
are also quite tender to frost. They occur abun- 
dantly in south Florida and most parts of the Ameri- 
can tropics. They have long been one of the chief 
crops in certain of the smaller of the British West 
Indies, where they are grown for pickling and for 
making commercial lime juice and citric acid. They 
are also shipped to some extent in the fresh state. 
It is really remarkable that limes are not more 
widely known and used at the North. They almost 
entirely replace lemons for local use in the tropics, 
and every one who goes there soon learns to greatly 
prefer them. They have an aromatic quality that 
makes the lemon seem flat and flavorless by compari- 
son. Some trouble has been experienced in ship- 
ping them, since they do not keep as well as lemons, 
but this is largely due to crude methods in handling 
them. When the matter of proper handling and 
curing shall have received sufficient attention, fresh 
limes will doubtless become a much more important 
commercial factor. In general, limes are subject to 
the same diseases and insects as the orange. They are 
particularly susceptible to a fungous disease known 
as “wither tip ” (Gleosporium), which also attacks 
many of the other citrus fruits. It causes a spot-  
-P-A-G-E-288
  264 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
| 
ting of the leaves, attacks and kills the young twigs, 
and blasts or rots the young fruits. It can be con- 
trolled by Bordeaux, and spraying may prove neces- 
sary in commercial lime growing. 
Commercial citron is the thick preserved and 
dried rind of another large lemon-shaped citrus 
fruit (Citrus medica). It is found occasionally in 
south Florida and the islands, but it is nowhere 
cultivated on a commercial scale. 
Tropical Fruits 
Among the great numbers of tropical fruits only 
pineapples and bananas are as yet of any real com- 
mercial importance outside of the local markets. 
Mangoes and avocates are, however, beginning to 
receive considerable attention, and without doubt the 
better varieties of them will soon be widely planted 
for Northern shipment. 
Pineapple (Ananas).— This fruit is extensively 
planted for market in south Florida, the Bahamas, 
Cuba, and Porto Rico, and it is locally important in 
all the other tropical countries. It will not endure 
much frost and in Florida it is largely grown under 
the protection of lathe houses. The partial shade 
thus afforded seems congenial and adds to the vigor 
and productiveness of the plants. In the tropics they 
are usually grown in the open. Occasionally, how- 
ever, they are shaded by bananas. 
Pineapples will grow on a great variety of soils, 
provided only they are dry and well drained. On 
damp, heavy soil the plants are short lived and the 
fruit is lacking in flavor. In Florida most of the

  FRUITS 265 
pine plantations are on what seems to be an old sand 
dune, and the soil is an almost pure white sand. Of 
course, large quantities of fertilizer are required. 
In Cuba, on the other hand, they are grown on the 
heavy red cane lands without the use of fertilizers. 
This is possible on account of the remarkable natural 
underdrainage of these red lands. The additional 
precaution is also taken of planting on ridges in order 
to more quickly run off the surface water after rains. 
In Florida, in order to economize space under the 
expensive lathe houses, pines are planted very closely 
on wide beds with narrow paths between the beds. 
In Cuba, they are planted in single rows with the 
plants about fifteen inches apart in the row. The 
sets used for planting are of two kinds, suckers and 
crowns. The first are side branches. These are 
broken off and planted during late spring or early 
summer, and they will produce a crop in twelve 
months. They are only produced in small numbers, 
however, so that most of the plantings are made with 
crowns; a circle of these offshoots comes out at the 
base of each fruit. They are smaller than the 
suckers, and it requires eighteen months for them 
to produce fruit. They are usually planted in late 
summer or fall. 
For distant shipment it is necessary to pick the 
fruit while it is still quite green. This is unfortu- 
nate, since the pine only develops its full sweetness 
and flavor when allowed to ripen on the plant. 
Those who have only eaten pines as they appear in 
the Northern markets can have no idea of what a 
delicious fruit it really is. A fully ripe pine is, how-
-P-A-G-E-292
  266 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
ever, too delicate tostand ordinary shipment. Heavy 
losses often occur in handling even the green ones, 
especially if they are picked during or after very 
wet weather. This loss could doubtless be largely 
avoided, and the fruit be at the same time marketed 
in a riper condition by the use of proper refrigerator 
transportation. 
A considerable number of varieties of pines are 
known, but only a very few are of commercial 
importance. The one most generally planted for 
the Northern market is the Red Spanish. This 
is a small or medium-sized acid pine of rather 
poor quality, but it is hardy and productive and 
ships better than any of the others. The Smooth 
Cayenne and the Porto Rico or Cabazona are two 
very large pines that are grown in a small way for 
the fancy trade. While very showy, both are rather 
acid and cannot be classed as of the best quality. 
Unfortunately the sweetest, highest-flavored kinds, 
that are most prized for home consumption, like the . 
Ripley and the Sugar loaf or Pifia Blanca, are so 
delicate that they will not stand ordinary transpor- 
tation. 
As arule pines are comparatively free from diseases 
and insectpests. While they have their troubles, these 
are mostly obscure and unimportant and space cannot 
be taken to discuss them. 
Bananas (Musa).— In the space of a single gen- 
eration the banana has passed from a rare luxury to 
an article of common everyday necessity, and its 
production and marketing has developed into an 
immense industry. The business is largely in the

FRUITS 267 
hands of a single corporation, the United Fruit 
Company, and this concern alone constantly employs 
from one to two hundred steamships in carrying 
bananas from various tropical ports to the United 
States. 
The banana is strictly tropical and will not endure 
frost. It grows everywhere in the tropics under a 
great variety of conditions, and it is an important 
factor in the local food supply. It grows best, 
however, in deep, rich, alluvial soils, and it is particu- 
larly partial to sheltered valleys along streams. The 
greater part of the bananas grown for export are on 
river-bottom lands. Jamaica was originally the chief 
source of supply for the banana ships, and for many 
years this has been the principal industry of that 
island. Plantations at various points on the Central 
American coast have, however, constantly increased 
in importance, and the larger part of this fruit reach- 
ing the United States now comes from that quarter. 
Cuba produces some commercial bananas, but the con- 
ditions are less favorable than in these other countries. 
. Bananas are propagated by means of suckers that 
spring up freely from the roots. The usual distance 
for planting is about fifteen feet apart each way. 
Cultivation is very simple, consisting simply in keep- 
ing down grass and weeds with the hoe or cultivator. 
New lands are preferred for bananas, when possible. 
The timber is cut down and burned and the plants 
are set among the blackened stumps without plowing 
or other preparation of the soil. <A great effort is 
usually made to keep these new-land plantations free 
from grass. Men go around with sacks and pull up
-P-A-G-E-296
  268 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
and carry from the field every bunch of grass that 
makes its appearance. This is much cheaper than 
attempting to cultivate in lands that are already in- 
fested with grasses, and it is astonishing how large 
an area a single man can keep absolutely clean by 
this method. In the older districts suitable new 
lands are no longer available, and this method can- 
not be employed. Each sucker produces a bunch of 
fruit in about fifteen months. When the fruit is 
cut, the stalk dies and makes room for the growth of 
the new suckers that have sprung up from its roots. 
The same plantation thus produces fruit continu- 
ously for many years, but constant care is needed in 
thinning out the suckers or they will soon become 
too crowded to produce salable bunches. The crop 
is a continuous one throughout the year, but it is 
much heavier at some seasons than at others, this 
mainly depending on the distribution of the rainfall: 
The time of fruiting can also be controlled to some 
extent when thinning the suckers, by saving only 
those of a certain size which will naturally bear at 
the desired season. 
Bananas are always cut green even when intended 
for home consumption. If allowed to hang on the 
stalk, they ripen unevenly, so that many are wasted 
and the quality is no better than when house ripened. 
The bunches are handled and loaded in bulk without 
packing of any kind. Ships for the banana trade 
need to be especially constructed so as to allow for 
a free circulation of air below decks and to be abun- 
dantly provided with ventilator funnels. More than 
one cargo has rotted and been dumped overboard
-P-A-G-E-297
  FRUITS 269 
for lack of these requirements. Bananas do not 
carry well under refrigeration, but tend to blacken 
and soften quickly. Good ventilation is, however, 
very essential. 
A great number of varieties are known, but there 
is great confusion in regard to their proper names. 
Only one is ordinarily planted for Northern shipment. 
This is known as the Dominica. in Jamaica, as the 
Johnson in Cuba, and as the Jamaica in some of the 
other countries. A large red banana is also some- 
times seen and seems to be gaining favor in the 
markets. The dwarf Cavendish variety, or “Enana,” 
is a favorite in the English market, but this is more 
delicate and each bunch is usually crated separately. 
The “ Datil,” or date banana, is a very small, high-fla- 
vored kind that is much prized for home consumption, 
but is practically unknown at the North. It is quite 
firm and would carry well. By a little effort it 
might easily be introduced to the fancy trade, but it 
is not prolific enough and is too small to ever com- 
pete with the Dominica in the general market. The 
“ Manzana,” or apple banana, is a medium-sized kind, 
having a trace of acid which gives its flavor a supposed 
resemblance to that of anapple. It is much relished 
by some and is the leading kind in the Havana 
market, but it is seldom shipped as it does not carry 
well. The various cooking bananas or plantains are 
an exceedingly important article of food throughout 
the tropics, where they are used both in the green 
and ripe stage. They are either baked or fried. 
They are sold to some extent in New Orleans and 
the Florida cities, where there are many Cubans and
-P-A-G-E-298
  270 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
other Latin Americans who are accustomed to them, 
but they are practically unknown at the North. 
Their quality as a vegetable is really so good that a 
demand could doubtless be created for them by a 
little properly directed effort. In most tropical 
markets they sell for double the price of the table 
kinds. 
Bananas are singularly free from fungous and insect 
troubles. A bacterial top rot attacks the stalks in 
some parts of Cuba and a serious disease of an un- 
known character has appeared at a few points in 
Central America. The decay of the fruit is some- 
times hastened by the attack of an anthracnose 
(Gleosporium), but little study has been given to 
these troubles and no remedies can be suggested. 
Nut Crops 
Pecans and cocoanuts are the only ones of suffi- 
cient importance to require special mention. Peanuts 
have already been referred to under forage plants, 
but on some of the lighter soils in the middle South 
they are grown extensively as a market crop. They 
can be grown successfully in all parts of the South 
on the lighter, drier soils and also in most tropical 
regions. hey do not thrive on wet, heavy soils. 
Pecans (Hicoria Pecan). — This is a native forest 
tree in many parts of the South extending north 
along the river bottoms as far as southern Illinois. 
The large, thin-shelled or so-called paper-shelled 
types that are now in cultivation came originally 
from Texas and Louisiana. They can be grown in 
practically all parts of the cotton belt, but the large
-P-A-G-E-299
NUT CROPS 271 
commercial plantings are mostly confined to the 
coast region. Few of the planted groves have yet 
reached full bearing, and most of the commercial 
supply still comes from wild trees. The pecan is 
very variable and does not come true from seed. 
Much disappointment has followed the planting of 
even the finest selected seeds, since more than half of 
the trees produced are likely, after years of waiting, to 
produce only ordinary inferior nuts. Pecans are very 
difficult to propagate by the ordinary methods of bud- 
ding and grafting. A fairly successful method of patch 
budding or inlaying has, however, been devised, and 
budded trees of named varieties may now be secured 
from the leading Southern nurseries. The price for 
these budded trees is quite high, owing to the diffi- 
culty of production, but it is better to use them for 
commercial planting rather than to risk the uncertain 
quality of seedlings. Since the pecan grows into a 
large forest tree, it is necessary to plant them at a 
considerable distance ; forty to fifty feet is none too 
much, but the space between may be utilized for 
other crops or for planting peaches or other orchard 
trees. Heavy applications of nitrogenous fertilizers 
should be used in order to hasten growth and bring 
the trees more quickly up to the bearing size. The 
worst drawback to the pecan industry is the length 
of time that must elapse before returns can be 
expected. Well-grown trees may produce a few 
nuts when six or seven years planted, but profitable 
crops cannot be expected for a much longer period. 
A number of insect and fungous pests occur, but no 
discussion of them can be attempted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  272 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
Cocoanuts ( Cocos). — Cocoanuts are widely planted 
in most tropical countries. Formerly they were 
an important crop at many points in the West 
Indies, but the wide spread in recent years of the 
disease known as “ bud rot” has practically wiped 
out the industry at many points where it was once 
most flourishing. At the present time it would be 
an unsafe investment to plant cocoanuts in any of 
the islands where the disease is known to occur. 
The few groves in southern Florida have not as yet 
been attacked by it. Cocoanuts will grow under a 
great variety of conditions, but they thrive best near 
the sea, and they will grow and bear well even where 
they are occasionally drenched with salt spray. 
Their cultivation is very simple. The fully ripe 
nuts are gathered as they fall and are placed close 
together in nursery beds for germination without 
removing the thick outer husk. They germinate 
best when only partially covered with soil. After 
two or three leaves have formed the young tree, 
nut and all, is moved to its permanent location. 
It is hoed around a little for the first year or two, 
after which it practically shifts for itself. Nuts 
will be produced in from six to ten years accord- 
ing to location and care. The nuts are produced 
in large clusters at the top of the tree. These 
are produced in constant succession, several bunches 
with nuts of different sizes being seen on the tree 
at the same time, so that the crop is a perpetual 
one. The nuts fall as they ripen, when they are 
picked up, the thick, fibrous outer husk is cut 
away, and they are ready for market. Besides their
-P-A-G-E-301
  
NUT CROPS 273 
use in the fresh state they are largely used for oil 
making. Some well-marked varieties occur and 
individual trees are known to vary greatly in pro- 
ductiveness and in the size and quality of the nuts, 
but as is the case with so many tropical products 
almost no attention has been given to selecting these 
better strains for propagation. 
Cocoanut bud rot is one of the most destructive 
of known plant diseases. The foliage on a thrifty 
bearing tree suddenly turns a little yellowish and 
the petioles of the great leaves will droop a little 
and stand at a slightly wider angle, and the imma- 
ture nuts will begin to fall. It takes a keen eye to 
catch this first symptom of trouble in the leaves and 
to differentiate it from the yellowing caused by scale 
insects or other troubles, but the falling of the 
young fruit is an almost certain symptom of in- 
cipient bud rot. As the disease progresses the 
yellowing and general demoralization of the foliage 
becomes more pronounced, until finally the entire 
top of the tree suddenly blackens and falls away, 
leaving the trunk standing as a leafless stump. 
Sometimes the oldest leaves will not be affected, but 
will remain green for a time after the bud and 
upper younger leaves have rotted and fallen. The 
disease seems unquestionably to be a bacterial one, 
although this has not as yet been absolutely proven 
by successful inoculations with pure cultures of the 
germ. Dissections of the diseased trees at any 
stage will show more or less extensive areas where 
the young tissues are being attacked by a soft 
watery rot. When this finally reaches the large 
x  
-P-A-G-E-302
  274 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
central terminal bud, the whole mass of soft tissue of 
which it is composed is quickly reduced to a stink- 
ing pulp and the upper leaves topple over and fall. 
The disease, when once established, spreads gradually 
from tree to tree in ever widening circles. The 
exact manner in which the contagion is conveyed 
is not known, but it is probably carried by insects. 
It has been observed that the disease advances 
faster with the prevailing wind than against it. 
All ordinary remedial measures are powerless to 
reach a disease of this character and so far the 
planters have been helpless in trying to stay its 
progress. Some claim that touching a match to 
the dead leaves and trash always found hanging 
in the top of a cocoanut tree and thus disinfecting 
it by fire will often arrest the disease in its incip- 
ient stages. The observed facts indicate that this 
may be the case, but exact experiments are lacking. 
Theoretically the prompt cutting out and burning 
of all infected trees as soon as the disease can be 
detected should arrest the disease and perhaps 
ultimately stamp it out from any given locality, but 
the experiment never seems to have been tried on a 
sufficiently thorough and extensive scale to afford a 
demonstration. 
Scale insects of various kinds often attack the 
cocoanut and do considerable harm. The leaves turn 
yellow when attacked, and the tree loses vigor and 
in some cases even dies, but this is very rare. 
The leaves are also often spotted and discolored by 
the growth of various fungi. It is probable that, 
some of these fungous parasites are responsible for '%
-P-A-G-E-303
  TRUCK CROPS 275 
peculiar wasting disease that is sometimes observed 
when the leaves gradually grow smaller and smaller 
and finally dwindle away entirely. These other 
troubles are, however, all insignificant as compared 
with the bud rot. 
Truck CRops 
The name of truck farming has come to be applied 
to the growing of the different garden vegetables on 
an extensive scale for distant shipment. This is a 
business of great magnitude in many parts of the 
South, and since the American occupation it is 
coming to be of considerable importance in Cuba. 
Vegetables also are shipped North in a limited way 
from certain parts of Mexico. 
A great variety of soils are successfully employed 
for trucking, but light, sandy loams are usually pre- 
ferred, and most of the great trucking centers are on 
lands of this character. Alluvial and muck soils are 
also suitable for most of the truck crops. Other 
things being equal, of course, naturally rich soils are 
to be preferred to poor ones, but a suitable mechanical 
texture seems to be more important than chemical 
composition and many of the most extensive trucking 
districts are located on what are naturally very poor 
lands. Such soils, of course, require heavy manuring 
or the free use of chemical fertilizers combined with 
leguminous restorative crops. In fact, a proper un- 
derstanding of the use of fertilizers is one of the first 
requisites for a successful truck farmer. 
Of even greater importance than the proper selec- 
‘tion of soils and fertilizers is the question of trans-
-P-A-G-E-304
  276 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
portation. Some at least of the truck crops can be 
grown successfully by proper management under al- 
most any soil and climatic conditions that permit of 
agricultural operations of any kind, but they can 
only be profitably marketed from those points that 
have the most adequate transportation facilities. It 
thus follows that the trucking industry has clung 
close to the Atlantic seaboard within reach of cheap 
steamer transportation and to certain of the great 
North and South trunk railroad lines, where the man- 
agement has been intelligent enough to recognize its 
importance and to give it the necessary facilities and 
encouragement. So large has the annual movement 
become that it now constitutes one of the most im- 
portant items of business on a number of the leading 
Southern railroads and of the coastwise steamship 
lines. 
A large number of vegetables are grown and 
shipped as truck at different points in the Southern 
states. The following alphabetical list, while by no 
means complete, covers all that are of much impor- 
tance.

It is impossible within the limits of this volume 
to attempt a detailed discussion of each of these 
numerous crops. A few remarks of a general nature 
must suffice. For most of them, of course, the seed 
is simply planted in the field where it is to grow. 
Unlike the others, asparagus isa perennial. The seed 
is planted in seed beds or nursery rows, where the 
plants are allowed to grow from one to two years. 
The old and expensive plan of deep trenching for 
asparagus is unnecessary except perhaps on very 
heavy lands. Its chief requirements are a good per- 
meable soil and the very abundant use of manure and 
fertilizers. Cabbages, celery, egg plant, peppers, and 
tomatoes are usually planted in seed beds or in cold 
frames and the plants are moved to the field when 
from four to six weeks old. In the more northerly 
districts it is usual to sow the seed of the last three in 
hotbeds that are heated by manure or other artificial 
heat and are protected by glass frames or sash. When 
the first rough leaves appear, the seedlings are pricked 
out into cold frames that are protected by glass or by 
cotton cloth which is reénforced by hay or other coy- 
ering during cold snaps. These frames are, of course, 
opened during the day when the weather will permit. 
The proper care of such plant beds is a matter re- 
quiring experience and good judgment. From the 
cold frames the plants are carried to the field, usually 
with a ball of dirt, as soon as the danger of frost is 
over. By this method it is possible to secure crops 
from four to six weeks earlier than when the seed is 
planted in the open air. In southern Florida and the 
tropics these methods are, of course, unnecessary. 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  278 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
The seed of these crops may there be planted directly 
in the field and the plants then thinned to a stand, 
but even here it is more usual to plant in seed beds 
and move them to the fields when from six to eight 
inches high. 
Sweet potatoes (Jpomea) deserve a word of special 
mention, not only because they are widely grown as a 
truck crop, but from their importance in the home 
economy of every Southern farm. They are grown as 
universally as are Irish potatoes at the North, and not 
only furnish a standard vegetable for the table but are 
much used for stock food. The vines, too, make a 
rich forage. They are particularly useful for hogs. 
These animals are turned into special fields, planted 
for the purpose, to dig for themselves, or after the 
crop is harvested they are allowed to glean the roots 
and small potatoes that have been missed in digging. 
The small potatoes that are unfit for market make 
excellent feed for milch cows and horses. 
At the North sweet potatoes are always propagated 
by bedding the small ones in the spring and pulling 
up the numerous sprouts that spring from them to 
take to the field. At the South a small field is usually 
planted in this way in the spring, but the main 
plantings are made at midsummer with vine cuttings 
taken from this early field. In the tropics vine cut- 
tings only are used, since they are available all the 
year round. ‘This custom has, however, led to the 
gradual loss of productiveness. Experiments have 
shown that by occasionally returning to the Northern 
method and planting the suckers that spring from the 
potatoes themselves the yield can be very considerably
-P-A-G-E-307
TRUCK CROPS 279 
increased. They are always planted on raised beds 
or ridges. 
Sweet potatoes are rather difficult to keep through 
the winter. For best results a rather warm uniform 
temperature and a dry atmosphere are required. In 
the large trucking districts special storage houses are 
provided with some means of artificial heating. The 
ordinary smal-farmer at the South, however, keeps 
them with considerable success by “ holing them up” 
in the ground as is done with apples and Irish potatoes 
at the North. The hole must, however, be thoroughly 
drained and the potatoes kept from actual contact 
with the dirt by the free use of dry grass or pine 
straw. <A ventilating pipe must also be left in the 
top of the pile, and it is best to provide some tempo- 
rary shelter to keep off the rain. 
In Cuba the number of truck crops is much more 
limited; only potatoes, onions, tomatoes, egg plant, 
and peppers are of much importance. These are all 
strictly winter or dry-season crops. They are mostly 
grown with irrigation, but some of the sandy lands 
in Penar del Rio province have such good moisture- 
holding capacity that good crops can be produced 
without it. Potatoes yield less than at the North, for 
though usually of good size they are few in the hill. 
Only the Bermuda onion is grown. Sets imported 
from the Canary Islands are used, since but poor 
success has been had in growing them from seed. To- 
matoes grow well and yield well for a time, but profit- 
able picking can usually only be secured for from three 
to four weeks, when the foliage is attacked by leaf 
mold and the fruit becomes too small for shipment.  
-P-A-G-E-308
  280 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
Successive plantings are necessary in order to keep up 
continuous shipments. Egg plants and peppers grow 
and yield well for a long period, but the former are 
subject to a stem blight or wilt that frequently 
causes heavy losses. 
Among the distinctively tropical vegetables there 
are three that deserve some especial mention from 
their importance in the local markets and as a 
source of home food supply, though as yet they are 
unknown in Northern commerce. These are yams, 
cassava, and malangas, or yautias. 
Yams (Dioscorea).—The true yams are the large, 
irregular starchy tubers of tall-growing vines belong- 
ing to various species of Dioscorea. Sweet potatoes 
are often called yams in the Southern states, but this 
is not the proper use of the word. Yams require a 
moist, rich soil that is well supplied with vegetable 
matter. They are planted in large hills or in rather 
high ridges in order to secure perfect drainage, and 
tall stakes are necessary for the vines to climb on. 
Pieces of the tubers are planted for seed the same as 
with the potato. It requires about twelve months 
for the crop to mature. The tubers are large, often 
weighing several pounds each. They are used in 
the same manner as potatoes, but they are more 
nutritious and constitute one of the most important 
of the tropical food crops. The tubers keep indefi- 
nitely while undisturbed in the ground, but they 
cannot be kept long after digging. 
Cassava (Manihot).—The sweet cassava, or 
“yuea,” as it is called in Spanish-speaking countries, 
isanother tropical food crop of muchimportance. The
-P-A-G-E-309
TRUCK CROPS 281 
term “cassava” in Spanishis applied to a kind of bread 
made from the starchy roots and not to the plant 
itself, as in English. The roots of the bitter cassa- 
vas, which closely resemble the sweet varieties in 
appearance, contain hydrocyanic acid and therefore 
are poisonous. They are, however, largely employed 
in starch making. Cassava starch is of superior 
quality. As the yield per acre is much greater 
than with potatoes, there is reason to suppose that the 
starch industry of the tropics will ultimately prove 
to be of great importance. The long, fleshy roots’ 
(not tubers) constitute the edible part of the plant. 
They are cut up in sections and boiled like potatoes. 
They do not become mealy, but remain wet and 
soggy, and though on account of their easy produc- 
tion they are very widely used, they do not com- 
pare as a food with either yams or malangas. 
Besides its use for food and in starch making cassava 
furnishes a good stock food, being eaten by both 
hogs and cattle. It can be grown with some success 
in Florida and along the Gulf coast, where it has 
attracted considerable attention as a forage plant. 
It is propagated by means of cuttings of the stems. 
These grow very readily. The plant is not particu- 
lar as to soils, but will thrive on a great variety of 
them and will give fair yields on land that is too 
poor for most other crops. The plant is perennial, 
and the roots continue to increase in size for a 
number of years. They soon begin to get woody, 
however, so the crop is usually dug in from twelve 
to eighteen months. Roots of edible size are pro- 
duced in six to eight months if conditions are favor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
282 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
able. The number of varieties both of the sweet 
and bitter kinds is very great, and there is always 
some danger of the two becoming confused. Acci- 
dents from this cause are, however, infrequent since 
the bitter taste serves to distinguish those that are 
poisonous. 
Malangas or Yautias (Xanthosoma).— These are 
the names used in Cuba and Porto Rico, respectively, 
for the edible tubers produced by various species 
of Xanthosoma, plants closely related to, and greatly 
resembling, the common Caladium, or elephant’s ear, 
of Northern conservatories and gardens. “Taro” 
(Colocasia sp.), the famous food plant of the Hawai- 
ian Islands and the East, is a very similar plant, that 
also occurs in the West Indies, and is often confused 
with the others under the same names. Other local 
names are applied to these plants in different Ameri- 
can tropical countries, and everywhere they consti- 
tute an important local food supply. They grow 
well on almost any good soil, but are particularly 
adapted to moist, rich alluvial lands. In favorable 
locations they yield enormously. They are used the 
same as potatoes; they are even more nutritious, and 
the better varieties are equally palatable. Unlike 
yams and cassava the tubers keep almost indefinitely 
when dug if stored in a dry place. They are propa- 
gated by cutting up the old or so-called “mother” 
tuber, which, though still edible, is not equal for food 
to the new offshoots. Forty or fifty distinct varieties 
have been recognized, though most of them are very 
local, usually only a few kinds being known and 
planted in any given region.  
-P-A-G-E-311
  FORESTRY 283 
ForEstry 
While forestry is, perhaps, not strictly a branch 
of agriculture, yet the influence of forests on agri- 
cultural conditions is so great that a few words on 
the subject will not be out of place. Until the last 
very few years this vitally important question has 
received no attention whatever at the South. The 
great natural pine and hardwood forests have been 
ruthlessly cut down for lumber, or to clear the land 
for farming, with no thought for the future timber 
supply, or for the bad effect of this wholesale de- 
forestation on the climate; and annual fires have 
prevented the growth of new forests on what are 
otherwise waste lands. In the tropical countries the 
story is the same. Countless acres of valuable hard- 
woods have been cut down and burned to make 
room for sugar and coffee plantations, and the re- 
maining forests are being ransacked for cedar and 
mahogany. ‘The time has at last arrived when the 
general public is beginning to realize the immense 
importance of preserving forest conditions in all 
rough, mountainous regions that are unfit for culti- 
vation, and even some of the large lumber companies 
who, in the past, have been among the most ruthless 
of destroyers, are beginning to adopt means for har- 
vesting their mature timber without ruining the 
young trees and preventing the reforesting of the 
land. The Europeans long ago learned to so manage 
forests as to make them a perpetual source of income. 
No lesson is more needed in all the American coun- 
tries than this one. ‘ 
Deforestation has already reached the point 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
284 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
where the future timber supply is seriously threat- 
ened. The commercial planting of forests to meet 
this prospective demand has already begun, and it is 
destined in the near future to reach much greater 
proportions. Persons embarking in this business, 
however, at the South, will be greatly handicapped 
by lack of knowledge as to the cultural possibilities 
and needs of the principal Southern timber trees. 
Very little data is at hand as to the best methods of 
propagation and management, or as to the rate of 
growth and time required for maturity of the different 
species. In the American tropics this lack of knowl- 
edge is so great as to be almost absolute. Whether 
or not such valuable timber trees as West Indian 
cedar and mahogany can be profitably grown on 
what would otherwise be waste land in those regions 
where they are native, but where they are now so 
rapidly vanishing, is a question of vast economic 
importance, but it is one that will require years of 
expensive experimentation to determine. Questions 
of this kind, which require so many years before 
practical results can be expected, are difficult of 
solution by private enterprise, but they are preémi- 
nently suitable subjects for research stations that re- 
ceive government support. The time has now come 
when extensive scientific experimentation in both 
forest planting and forest management is urgently 
needed at the hands of each of the American 
governments. 
Domestic ANIMALS 
No general agricultural treatise can be considered 
complete without at least some reference to those
-P-A-G-E-313
  DOMESTIC ANIMALS 285 
domestic animals that play so important a part in all 
farm economy. A full discussion of this subject as 
it applies to the South and to the tropics would, 
however, require a separate volume or rather a series 
of volumes. Space here will only permit of a few 
general remarks and considerations. 
Climatic conditions favor animal husbandry at the 
South, since expensive shelters are not required and 
pasturage and other green forage can be furnished 
for the greater part of the year, thus avoiding the 
necessity for curing and storing large quantities of 
hay. It is true that the familiar Northern pasture 
and hay grasses cannot be successfully grown, but 
there are many others to take their places. Ber- 
muda is as good as bluegrass for permanent pastures, 
while cowpeas, vetch, crab grass, and Johnson grass 
can be made to take the place of timothy and clover 
for hay. Under these circumstances it is an eco- 
nomic anomaly that the South has been for so long 
a time dependent on the North for her supply of 
horses and mules, beef, butter, lard, and pork, when 
as a matter of fact she might be producing them 
cheaper than is possible in the regions from which 
they are imported. This condition has probably 
largely come from the pernicious system of annual 
leases that prevails so widely throughout the cot- 
ton belt. The poor ignorant negro farm hands are 
usually each allotted a certain number of acres to be 
cultivated on shares. As cotton is the chief money 
crop, he is required to plant it all in cotton and is 
furnished a mule and is given credit at the store for 
his meal and pork. He has no incentive for building
-P-A-G-E-314
  286 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
up the fertility of the soil and neither the knowl- 
edge, the inclination, nor the means for embarking in 
stock breeding. In those sections where the farmers 
own and work their own lands attention is being 
rapidly turned to more diversified farming and the 
production of home food supplies. 
In Cuba and other parts of tropical America the 
cattle industry has long been an important one. 
Here cattle graze throughout the year and receive 
no feed aside from the luxuriant pasturage. If 
means were taken to improve the breeding of these 
herds and some provision were made, which might 
easily be done, for growing some forage with which 
to supplement the pasturage during the pinch of the 
dry season, the beef from these wonderful Guinea 
and Para-grass pastures might quickly become an 
important factor in the world’s markets. 
A word in regard to each of the more important 
kinds of live stock must close this ‘very inadequate 
treatment of a most important subject. 
Horses and mules thrive well in all parts of these 
Southern countries. They are subject to no serious 
diseases that are not familiar at the North, though 
horses when first taken South require a few months 
in which to become acclimated before they are fit 
for very heavy work. 
‘The heavy draught breeds of horses do not seem to 
stand hard work in hot climates as well as mules, and 
for all heavy work these animals largely take their 
place in Southern countries. Millions of dollars are 
spent annually by Southern farmers to buy mules in 
the middle West. Even in tropical regions the
-P-A-G-E-315
  DOMESTIC ANIMALS 287 
mule is gradually but surely crowding out the ox as 
a work animal. With abundant cheap pasturage it 
costs but little more to raise a two-hundred-dollar 
mule than a forty-dollar ox, and it is most surprising 
that the subject of mule breeding is not receiving 
more attention in all of these Southern countries. 
At the South and in the tropics cattle imported 
from the North are attacked by the serious disease 
variously known as Texas fever, tick fever, or 
splenic fever. It is caused by a minute parasite 
of the red blood corpuscles that is very similar to the 
one causing malarial fevers in man. In the case of 
the cattle disease, however, the parasite is carried, 
not by mosquitoes, but by certain species of cattle 
ticks. Native Southern cattle have all become im- 
mune to this disease although the parasite is still 
present in their blood, and hence they are constantly 
infecting the ticks which bite them. The presence 
of even a few of these ticks on imported Northern 
animals will quickly induce the disease. A method 
of artificial immunization has, however, now been 
devised which consists in inoculating the animals to 
be treated with fresh blood serum taken from an 
animal that is known to be immune. The toxine 
contained in this serum induces a slight attack of the 
fever, which renders the animal immune to future 
natural tick inoculations. By previously immuniz- 
ing young Northern cattle in this way they can be 
taken South or to the tropics with the loss of not 
over 10 per cent and frequently of less than 5 per 
cent, while without this treatment the loss would 
run from 50 per cent to 90 per cent. It is now,
-P-A-G-E-316
ee ee mem eS Tere Mer Tron nes ere 
288 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
therefore, perfectly possible to import breeding ani- 
mals of the best strains for grading up Southern 
herds for both beef and dairy purposes. These 
ticks, though not able to cause disease in native or 
immunized cattle, are often so abundant as to prove 
a veritable scourge and to greatly retard growth. 
The animals may be cheaply freed from these pests 
by running them occasionally through dipping tanks 
which contain contact insecticides. A thin skim of 
crude petroleum floating on water is often used for 
this purpose, but for hot weather some of the arseni- 
cal dips are found to give less discomfort and to be 
equally effective. Practical methods have also been 
devised for permanently freeing pastures from ticks, 
and they are being adopted by some of the more 
progressive Southern cattle men. 
The opinion prevails quite widely that the South 
is not adapted to dairying. This is a great mistake, 
for by the use of centrifugal separators most excellent 
butter can be made at any point in the South or the 
tropics, where a small amount of ice can be secured 
for cooling and ripening the cream. The fact that 
more butter and cheese are not made in these regions 
of cheap and perpetual pasturage only indicates a 
lack of knowledge and enterprise on the part of the 
stockmen and farmers. 
Hogs, too, should be much more largely raised at 
the South. There is no excuse for the unnumbered 
trainloads of bacon, hams, and lard that are constantly 
pouring into a region where besides corn such useful 
hog foods as cowpeas, peanuts, chufas, rape, and 
sweet potatoes are so easily and cheaply grown. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  
DOMESTIC ANIMALS 289 
Cuba and the other regions where the Royal palm is 
abundant, its rich, oily fruits or nuts furnish a nutri- 
cious hog food which is always in season, each tree 
ripening from nine to twelve large bunches in suc- 
cession during the year. Thisis practically the only 
hog food used in these countries, but it might easily 
be supplemented not only by the crops mentioned 
above, all of which grow readily in these regions, 
but by sugar cane, the stalks of which are greedily 
eaten by hogs, and by the very productive cassava 
and malanga as well. Notwithstanding these obvi- 
ous advantages for hog raising, every steamer bound 
southward carries lard, hams, and other hog products 
as an important part of her cargo. There seems to 
be no special hog disease at the South. Cholera is 
sometimes a great scourge, as at the North, but out- 
breaks can usually be controlled by proper isolation 
and quarantine. 
Sheep raising is another industry that should re- 
ceive more attention. Much of the hill lands that 
are comparatively worthless for other purposes are 
admirably adapted for sheep, and even the low, sandy 
savannahs near the Gulf coast, contrary to the ordi- 
narily accepted belief, make most excellent sheep 
ranges and support considerable flocks throughout 
the year without any other food. Besides the an- 
nual clip of wool the early spring lambs are always 
in demand at good prices. The worthless dogs that 
so infest the South are the worst enemies of the 
sheep raiser but wherever this industry has gained 
much importance means are readily found for their 
destruction. While the usual sheep diseases occur, 
U
-P-A-G-E-318
  290 THE CHIEF SOUTHERN AGRICULTURAL CROPS 
they are no more troublesome than in more north- 
erly latitudes. In the tropics sheep soon lose’a 
part of their woolly coating and hence are only val- 
uable for mutton. They thrive there fairly well, how- 
ever, and as they can be raised with a minimum of 
care and expense, they deserve more attention for this 
purpose than is generally given them. 
Goats are very hardy, prolific animals, that are 
particularly well adapted to all warm climates. In 
southern Europe they play an important part in the 
agricultural economy, but here they are usually looked 
upon more as a nuisance than a source of profit. They 
will, however, live and thrive where the pasturage is 
too poor to support any of the other domestic animals. 
The flesh, especially of the young animals, is very good 
food, notwithstanding the American prejudice to the 
contrary, and the skins furnish a valuable article of 
commerce. The number and aggregate: value of the 
goatskins annually imported into the United States 
are so great as to be almost unbelievable. The best 
milk strains produce a very large quantity of milk 
and butter fat when compared with the quantity and 
value of the food consumed. It seems probable, 
therefore, that in the future these animals will occupy 
‘a much more important place in Southern agriculture 
than they do at present. 
Poultry and eggs are universally raised in the 
South and in the tropics for home consumption, and 
their sale in the local markets adds materially to the in- 
come of many households. Their attempted commer- 
cial production on a large scale has often resulted in 
failure, since to be successful it requires a large 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
  DOMESTIC ANIMALS 201 
amount of special knowledge and experience and the 
closest possible attention to details. There is probably 
somewhat more trouble from mites and other parasites 
than at the North, and some diseases occur that are not 
known there, like the so-called “ sore head” that is so 
troublesome with young chicks hatched during the 
rainy summer season. These disadvantages are, how- 
ever, more than offset by the mild climate that allows 
poultry to range throughout the year and by the 
cheap and varied food supply. The entire region 
offers an inviting field for. chicken fanciers and expert 
breeders. Every farm should unquestionably pro- 
duce an abundance of chickens and eggs for house- 
hold purposes with a margin over for the grocer, and 
much more attention should be given to the breeding 
of improved strains and races; but those without ex- 
pert knowledge of the business should make haste 
slowly in embarking on large commercial poultry 
enterprises until this knowledge has been gained by 
considerable practical experience.

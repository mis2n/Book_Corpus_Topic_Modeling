HOW MUCH ENGLISH 
GRAMMAR? 
INTRODUCTION 
In 1914 the present writer, in co-operation with Professor 
W. A. Cook, published the results of an investigation relating 
to the spelling vocabulary of pupils in American schools. 
The method of this investigation consisted in an examination 
of a large amount and variety of writing in order to discover 
what words are commonly used in written expression by typical 
adults in various walks of life. As a consequence of this 
investigation and others of the same character it has become 
possible to indicate definitely the list of words that should 
constitute the spelling vocabulary of pupils in the elementary 
and the high school. This method of determining the content 
of a subject taught in the schools received the approval of 
teachers and of students of education, and it was suggested 
to the writer by some of his correspondents that the method 
should be employed in the determination of the content of 
other subjects than spelling. 
The writer had long been desirous of conducting an inquiry 
with a view to learning what grammatical constructions are 
commonly used by adults in their written expression, and it 
seemed to him that the method adopted in the study of the® 
spelling needs of people could be advantageously employed 
. in an investigation of their grammatical needs. So it was 
proposed to Professor M. J. Stormzand, who was then asso- 
ciated with the writer in the University of. Wisconsin, that he 
should co-operate in the investigation, and he consented to do 
so. He was admirably equipped for the work, having had 
extensive experience as a teacher of languages, and having 
9

conducted investigations in various branches of linguistics. 
He has applied himself diligently to this task for seven or 
eight years; and mainly as a result of his devotion and ability, 
the investigation has finally been brought to a successful 
conclusion. 
This volume contains a vast amount of data presented in a 
simple, condensed, intelligible form; and the educational 
bearings of the conclusions reached are made prominent. It 
is shown herein what the grammatical needs of people in 
American life are, and how much and what phases of grammar 
should be stressed. in language and grammar courses. It is 
shown beyond question that many grammatical constructions 
to which much attention is given in our schools play very little 
réle in the written expression of American people, while other 
constructions that are not sufficiently stressed play an impor- 
tant réle. 
The data upon which the conclusions and suggestions con- 
tained in this volume are based are presented so that they can 
be easily comprehended. In its original draft the book 
contained seventy-four elaborate tables of figures, showing in 
numerical form the results of the study of every topic investi- 
gated, but the cost of publication as well as requirements of 
brevity compelled the elimination of many of these detailed 
tables. In place of such presentation, condensed forms have 
been used quite freely so that the reader may at a glance 
see how frequently different grammatical constructions 
are found in the various types of written expression which 
have been examined. Sample sentences are given to illustrate 
every variety of grammatical construction which has been 
studied, so that even.if a reader’s knowledge of grammar has 
“become hazy he may see from the sample sentences exactly 
what is meant when any variety of grammatical construction 
is being discussed. 
The data and conclusions appearing in this book should be 
of theoretical and practical value to all who are concerned in 
planning and teaching language and grammar courses in 
elementary and high schools, and they should also be of service 
to literary workers who are, or at least who should be, inter-

persons who use writing more or less naively merely to convey 
ideas to their friends or to the public.

  CHAPTER I 
THE NEED OF REVISED GRAMMAR COURSES 
Practical Revision of School Courses Needed.—Educators 
are beginning to recognize that their chief task at present is to 
determine, as speedily as may be consistent with scientific 
thoroughness, the proper content of the various parts or 
“studies” of the school curriculum. It is now generally 
agreed that such determination must be based largely upon 
the practical values and needs of real life. For each study in 
the course such questions as the following are being asked, and 
they must be answered if possible: 
How does this study apply to the actual needs and uses of 
daily life? 
What niay be done to make the next generation more efficient 
than the present in the knowledge and skill dealt with in this 
branch of school work? 
It is especially important that such questions as these 
should be answered with reference to that part of the curric- 
ulum pow commonly designated as “language work,” but 
more formally designated in an earlier day as the study of 
English grammar. We ought, if we can, to secure answers to 
the following questions: 
1. Just what phases of grammar does the typical American 
use in his every-day affairs? 2 
2. In what respects does the typical graduate of the elemen- 
tary or high school fail to meet the requirements of every-day 
life in regard to the use of grammar? 
When accurate data relating to these matters are before us, 
we can examine present-day practice in the schools in gram- 
mar-teaching, and we shall be in a position to suggest such 
eliminations, modifications, or additions, as may be required 
to meet the needs of daily life.

  Need of Revised Grammar Courses 13 
The Problems of Language Work in the Schools.—Many 
persons are asking whether the science of grammar should be 
taught at all in the public schools. This is a pertinent ques- 
tion. In the present period of readjustment in the curriculum 
of the elementary and high schools, most of the older or 
“traditional” studies are under indictment. The off-hand 
answer of reformers in the case of grammar shows a tendency, 
developing rapidly, especially in the case of text-book 
makers, to eliminate ‘‘formal” grammar. It is being dis- 
membered as a body of scientific knowledge and offered to 
pupils piecemeal, with a lack of agreement as to the relative 
importance or order of the various topics; and, more signifi- 
cantly still, it is being taught, “incidentally” as a minor phase 
of language study. 
Again, many persons are asking,—“‘ Does the study of the 
rules and principles function in the child’s use of language in 
every-day life?”’? ‘Does a person who writes and speaks 
correctly know the science of grammar?” ‘Is the person 
who speaks and writes incorrectly necessarily uninformed as 
to the rules of the science of speech?” 
Let us suppose for the moment that we have an affirmative 
answer to these questions, so that we may say that at least 
some grammar should be taught, and that its study will 
function, at least to some extent, in the use of language. 
Then the problem arises,—What should be taught? What 
should be the content of the course in grammar? It is the 
purpose of the present investigation to seek an answer to 
these questions by a careful examination of the whole matter 
from two points of view: 
1. What does present-day usage advise regarding the content 
of a grammar course? 
(a) As shown by a study of a large mass of contemporary 
writing, ranging from the best types of classical prose 
to the ephemeral matter of the daily newspaper and 
“light” fiction. 
(b) As shown by a study of the written work of pupils in - 
all grades from the sixth through the high school and 
college, and also letters and articles written by adults.
-P-A-G-E-12
  14 How Much English Grammar? 
’ 2. What does present-day need advise regarding the content 
of the grammar course; especially as determining the 
relative emphasis that should be given various topics? 
(a) This will take into consideration some previous studies 
that have been made by a number of investigators in 
the matter of persistent errors. 
(b) And will be supplemented by a careful examination of 
all the material used in 1 (6) above, with the expecta- 
tion of showing, not merely the relative frequency of 
various errors, but of establishing for these errors 
what may be called ‘‘ Error Quotients,’’ determined by 
using the frequencies of error for an individual or for 
a group as a numerator of a fraction, in which the 
denominator shall represent chances for error in any 
particular grammatical usage. 
To these will be added: 
3. A comparison of (1) and (2) with present-day practice 
in grammar teaching, as indicated by the content of several 
leading language and grammar text-books. 
The problem of what phases of grammar are most commonly 
found in every-day usage was selected for investigation, not 
only because its solution is essential to the determination of 
the content of the grammar course, but also because it is 
fundamental to other problems that need to be investigated, 
as, for instance,—When should grammar be taught? Is it 
advisable to teach it as a complete unit anywhere in the 
elementary or highschool? Is it advisable to spread grammat- 
ical study over a number of years of the curriculum, and if so, 
what topics are best suited to each grade? These questions 
can be answered only after the content of the course has been 
determined with some degree of accuracy, and after various 
arrangements suggested by the psychology of child develop- 
ment have been subjected to experimentation under usual 
school conditions. 
The Method of Conducting This Investigation.—Ten 
thousand sentences selected from material that represented 
all grades of current usage were analyzed and parsed. The 
sentences were selected from the following sources: 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
    Need of Revised Grammar Courses 15 
1. Five hundred sentences from Macaulay; 
2. Five hundred from Stevenson; 
3. Three thousand five hundred sentences of newspaper 
articles;! - 
4. One thousand five hundred sentences from university 
compositions; 
5. One thousand sentences from high-school compositions; 
6. One thousand sentences from fourth to eighth grade 
compositions; 
7. Fifty letters, containing about eight hundred sentences, 
received by a leading Woman’s magazine; 
8. Fifty letters, containing five hundred sentences, sent 
out by business men; 
9. Nine hundred sentences of present-day “‘light”’ fiction ;? 
10. Five hundred sentences of editorial material from news- 
papers and magazines. 
All this material was examined for the purpose of determin- 
ing frequencies in usage in respect to the following general 
grammatical topics: 
1. Sentence structure. 
2. Clauses. 
3. Phrases. 
4. Parts of speech. 
5. Uses of nouns,—kinds, cases, and construction. 
6. Uses of pronouns,—kinds, cases, and construction. 
7. Verbs,—tense, mood, kinds, regularity. 
8. Adjectives,—kind, comparison, regularity. 
9. Adverbs,—kind, comparison. 
10. The frequency of all other parts of speech. 
These large topics, which constitute the main divisions of 
a complete course in grammar, are dealt with in the succeeding 
chapters.

have been identified by the name or the nom de plume of the individual 
writers, as R. H. Little, “Lillian Russell,” ‘Helen Herald.” Much of the 
newspaper material was taken from several complete issues of the former 
Chicago Record-Herald.

CHAPTER II 
THE KINDS OF SENTENCES WE USE 
The Sentence the Key to the English Problem.—In both 
high-school and university instruction in English courses, 
increasing emphasis is being placed on the ability of students 
to write a “decent sentence.” 
If we were to enquire what English teachers understand by 
a ‘decent sentence,’”’ we should probably find that they agree 
on the following qualities: 
1. A ‘decent sentence” must be free from mistakes in 
spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 
2. It must have individuality, so far as its structure is 
concerned, so that all the sentences in a paragraph or composi- 
tion will not be just alike. In other words, one should be able 
freely to use sentences of different types or forms or lengths in 
order to give variety and freshness to one’s writing. 
Teachers of English ought to know what the usage in every- 
day life is. They should know what phases of sentence 
structure should be taught so that a high-school graduate shall 
be able to write as good sentences as are found in the daily 
newspaper or in the average business letter. We may be able 
to do more than this for some; we surely cannot do as much as 
this for all. But before we can measure our success, we must 
know what the real-life usage is. 
What kind of sentences, then, do people use in every-day 
expression,—simple, compound, or complex? What rdle 
does the imperative or the exclamatory sentence play in the 
writing of most persons, judged by the frequency with which 
these forms are used in every-day life? 
When we have answers to questions like these, we shall 
know what we ought to teach about the sentence. And 
when we know what knowledge and skill pupils must attain, 
- 16
-P-A-G-E-15
  
Kinds of Sentences We Use Ve 
we shall then need to distribute this material for use in the 
different grades of the school courses, so that each part of it will 
come at the time when pupils are beginning to employ the 
usage in their spontaneous expression; or the best time to teach 
the various grammatical elements is when pupils feel the need 
for using new forms and new constructions. 
Length of Sentences.—We shall be interested, first, to see 
if we can find a standard relating to the length of sentences in 
common use. In the analysis that was made of the ten 
thousand sentences taken from all varieties of written and 
printed material, it was found that the total number of words 
was approximately two-hundred thousand, which gives an 
average number of twenty words for the “‘every-day sentence.” 
Pursuing our inquiry further, we discover some interesting 
facts relating to the length of sentences as used by adults, 
and some important indications as to the development of 
sentence mastery by pupils at different stages in their school 
work. 
Some of the adult items examined in this study provide 
interesting variations from the average. In material selected 
from articles by William Hard and Arthur Brisbane, both 
editorial writers who have achieved a distinct “style,” we find 
short sentences used, by the former more strikingly than by 
the latter. Their respective averages are 14.4 and 18.1 words 
per sentence. 
The reader should be cautioned, however, against drawing 
the conclusion that short sentences are always simple sentences. 
That this is not necessarily the case will be seen when we 
analyze the writing of Hard, Brisbane, and others a little 
farther along in this chapter. 
The short sentence is characteristic of conversation as it is 
presented in written form. In sentences taken from a novel by 
Harold Bell Wright and a short story by E. Philips Oppen- 
heim, the average number of words per sentence in their 
conversational material is 12.6 and 13.3 respectively. These 
figures must be compared with the non-conversational material 
of the writers. The average length of their sentences in 
narrative writing is 24.6 for Wright and 16.3 for Oppenheim.
-P-A-G-E-16
  18 How Much English Grammar? 
In the absence of an analysis of actual conversational material, 
the averages given above may be taken as a provisional 
standard for the comparison of the sentence length in speech 
and in writing. 
At the other extreme we note Robert Louis Stevenson, who 
uses 31 words per sentence. We shall have occasion in 
connection with several of the succeeding discussions and 
diagrams of sentence structure to note how easy a control of 
the sentence Stevenson had, when we consider that his reputa- 
tion as a master of style rests largely on the clearness of his 
writing, while an analysis shows that he exceeds the averages 
in all those elements which involve synthetic and complicated 
sentence structure. 
His nearest competitors for sentence length fall about 
seven words short of his average sentence; and such writers as 
Harold Bell Wright in his non-conversational material, some of 
the signed newspaper writers that were analyzed, and the 
writers of letters to the Chicago Herald gained nothing by the 
use of the long sentence. In fact, the long sentence is not, in 
their case, an evidence of sentence mastery, but is often an 
evidence of the lack of it. 
The detailed tables on which this analysis is based show 
material from the fourth grade up through all of the twelve 
years of school and college work. Table 1 shows the develop- 
ment in sentence mastery at the various levels of school work. 
The average length of the sentences in the fourth grade 
material was approximately one-half the average of the total 
number of sentences investigated, or eleven words per sentence. 
This increases regularly throughout the twelve years of school 
life represented in our material, with the average sentence of 
the university freshman nearly equal to the adult average and 
the university upper-class student slightly exceeding this, 
with 21.5 words per sentence. 
We get our first hint as to proper material for the grammar 
course in connection with the length of sentences. 
If one can write at all, he can write short sentences. And 
he can be made to feel the rhetorical values in clearness, 
directness, and force in the purposeful use of the short sentence.

Monotony is not suggested; this may readily be avoided. 
If we are to apply the meaning of the success of such newspaper 
men as Brisbane and Hard to school procedure, we cannot 
overlook the value of the short-sentence ‘punch,’ the term 
practically invented to describe the style. Coupled with

by Brisbane in his violation of our text-book principles in 
his use of the fragmentary paragraph. On the other hand, 
we have the Stevenson standard to work for—clearness in 
thought, precision, fine shadings in meaning—by the use of 
complex sentences. What better practice in sentence building 
could one suggest than exercises in the transformation of 
common-place, average sentences into, first, the Hard or 
Brisbane type, and then into the Stevenson type? 
Kinds of Sentences.—The question of kinds of sentences 
used may be approached from two points of view,—the distinc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  20 How Much English Grammar? 
tion on the basis of meaning, as declarative, interrogative, 
imperative, or exclamatory; or on the basis of form,—as 
simple, compound, or complex.! 
Sentences Classified According to Meaning.—On the basis 
of meaning, the story of the sentence is soon told. In all of. 
the material analyzed, 92.2 per cent of the sentences were 
declarative, 6 per cent interrogative, and 1.8 per cent impera- 
tive. When we classify all of these sentences as exclamatory 
or non-exclamatory, we find only two per cent of the total 
in the former class. 
At this point, as we begin our analysis of the tables that 
were assembled, it should be stated that a study was made 
of the material by comparison with two general norms or 
standards. These were: 
1. The totals and their percentages of all the materials 
examined. 
2. Adult averages, comprising a set of totals with corre- 
sponding percentages made up by taking nineteen of the 
1 At the proper places, in connection with the grammatical terms used, 
examples will be given to show just what is involved in the discussion. 
Some of these illustrations may seem too obvious and too familiar to be 
necessary, but for the sake of completeness and with some consideration 
for the reader not versed in the technical nomenclature, this method seems 
worthwhile. 
(a) Declarative Sentence.—‘ Moreover, I lie here, by this water, to 
learn by root-of-heart a lesson which my master teaches me to call 
‘Peace, or Contentment.’ ’’—Stevenson, “Apology for Idlers.” 
(b) Interrogative Sentence.—“ How now, young fellow, what dost thou 
here ?”’—Ibid. 
(c) Imperative Sentence.—“ By all means begin your folio.” —Stevenson, 
“Aes Triplex.” 
(d) Exclamatory Sentence.—“ Atlas was just a gentleman with a pro- 
tracted nightmare!’ ’—Stevenson, “Apology for Idlers.” 
(e) Simple Sentence.—‘‘A bird will sing in the thicket.”—Ibid. Also 
(d) above. 
(f) Compound Sentence.—“ They have no curiosity; they cannot give 
themselves over to random provocations; they do not take pleasure in the 
exercise of their faculties for its own sake; and unless necessity lays about 
them with a stick, they will even stand still.’”’—Ibid. 
(g) Complex Sentence.—See (a) above. 
 
-P-A-G-E-19

twenty-eight types of material examined, so as to exclude 
the material from elementary school and high-school pupils, 
and university freshmen. These averages were intended 
especially as bases of comparison for the material of school 
levels with the expectation, resulting from observations made 
during the tallying, that these would indicate certain facts 
about the development of language habits from year to year 
in the life of school children. 
When we apply this second norm, the adult average, to the 
question of the kind of sentences used in daily life we find but a 
slight modification of the percentages already given for the 
totals. The adult average for the interrogative sentence is 
slightly higher, being 4.9 per cent. The same is true of the 
imperative and exclamatory sentences. 
The conclusion with respect to the prominence of these forms 
in the grammar course is easy to draw. While the interroga- 
tive and exclamatory sentences may be given some attention 
because they involve the possibility of error in punctuation 
at the end of the sentence, their infrequent usage will hardly 
warrant our making these forms very prominent. Additional 
consideration should be given to the fact that in most cases it 
is considered perfectly good form to use the period for the 
punctuation of the exclamatory sentence. Adequate emphasis 
on this mark of punctuation may be given in connection with 
lessons on the interjection, or on the use of the exclamation 
mark in punctuation within the sentence. 
The interrogation mark and its frequent violation will be 
considered further in the chapter on errors. On the basis of 
frequency of usage, we can hardly claim much prominence for 
it in the school course. 
Sentences Classified According to Form.—Diagram No. I 
shows the distribution of sentences according to form. Com- 
plex sentences occur most frequently, constituting 44.8 per 
cent of the total. Simple sentences constitute 38.0 per cent, 
and compound sentences 17.2 per cent. In comparing the 
adult average with the total, we find a slightly increasing 
tendency away from simple to complex sentences. 
   
-P-A-G-E-20
  22 How Much English Grammar? 
When we analyze the different items that make up these 
percentages, we discover a rather interesting story. The range 
in percentage of simple sentences as used by different writers 
varies from 21.8 to 64.8, the figures respectively for the 
material from Stevenson and Hard. These figures indicate the 
characteristic sentence structure of these writers, and may be 
taken as evidence of the possibilities involved in this phase of 
grammar in connection with the question of style.

Dracram I.—Kinds of sentences according to form. 
The range in the percentages of the compound and the 
complex sentences used ought to be considered at the same 
time. The comparison of the percentages for these two types 
of sentences as used by these two writers reveals the peculiar 
qualities of style of each. Of Stevenson’s sentences, 33.4 
per cent are compound, twice the average; of Hard’s, 10.2 per 
cent. Stevenson’s percentage of complex sentences is exactly 
that of the average, 44.8, while Hard’s is 26.0 percent. Analyz- 
ing the compound sentences of Stevenson still more fully, we 
find that 73.6 per cent of them contain complex clauses, as 
compared with an average of practically 60 per cent for all of 
the material. 
The next most striking fact about the forms of sentences 
used is that so many are near the average for all. Only a few 
items need to be noted as characteristic. The number of

simple sentences occurring in the material for the university 
upper classmen, a percentage of 22.2, (See Diagram II) is 
the second lowest figure and very nearly the same as that for 
Stevenson. This is not to be taken, however, as an indication 
that the university-student material is for this reason of

comparatively high literary value. Perhaps it is due tothe 
fact that this group shows up prominently in the complex 
sentence column, and the complexity of the university student’s 
typical sentence is a complexity born of confused thought or 
inability to recognize violations of unity and clearness. This 
is in contrast to the mastery of sentence structure by Stevenson,

  24 How Much English Grammar? 
who uses the devices of subordination and relationship to 
develop refinements of thought, to condense his expression, or 
to produce variety. 
Kinds of Compound Sentences—Making a more detailed 
analysis of the kinds of compound sentences appearing in the 
material, we distinguish five classes,—those with two or more 
simple clauses, those with complex clauses, and the compound- 
interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory forms.! The 
detailed analysis of this data does not seem worth while. Over 
95 per cent of all compound sentences were included in the 
first two classes, with about one-third in the first and two- 
thirds in the second class. 
There is an interesting point, however, relating to the use of 
these types by school pupils at different stages. These are 
represented in Diagram III, which shows a decrease in the 
use of compound sentences with two or more simple clauses 
from 63.6 per cent in the fourth grade to 22.3 per cent in the 
university upper-class material. In contrast to this, the 
diagram shows an increase in the use of compound sentences 
with complex clauses from 36.3 per cent in the sixth grade to 
77.7 per cent in the university upper-class material. The 
adult averages with which we compare these trends in the

(a) With Two or More Simple Clauses.—“ An inquiry must be in some 
acknowledged direction, with a name to go by; or else you are not inquir- 
ing at all, only lounging; and the workhouse is too good for you.”— 
Stevenson, ‘Apology for Idlers.” 
(b) With Complex Clauses.—‘“‘Young man, ply your book diligently 
now, and acquire a stock of knowledge; for when years come upon you, 
you will find that poring upon books will be but an irksome task.’’— 
Ibid. 
(c) Compound-interrogative—‘‘Is not this the hour of the class? and 
shouldst thou not be plying thy book with diligence, to the end thou 
mayest. obtain knowledge?’’—Ibid. 
(d) Compound-imperative-—See (b) above. 
(e) Compound-exclamatory.— ‘Learning, Quotha!’ said he; ‘I would 
have all such rogues scourged by the Hangman!’ ’’—Ibid. 
The last three types would also belong to either (a) or (b), but were 
tallied as belonging to these distinct sub-divisions.

sentences was 44.8, and that for adults the average was 45.6 per 
cent. When we look over the table containing the 28 items of 
all the material, we find that the range for complex sentences 
varies from 26.0 (Hard) to 56.6 (Associated Press) per cent of 
the total number of sentences. The high percentage of com- 
plex sentences in Associated Press material is due to the

precaution taken to guard all statements sent over the wire by 
quoting authority or source of information. This will be 
brought out more clearly in our study of noun clauses in 
Chapter III. 
All the material from the grades is below the average in 
complex sentences, as we might expect, since as a rule the 
intellectual processes of young pupils are not complex enough 
to require complex sentences for their adequate expression. 
The kinds of complex sentences used furnish some valuable 
material as a basis for grammar courses. In analyzing the 
complex sentences, a record was kept of eight different types,— 
(1) those containing a single adverbial clause, (2) a single 
adjective clause, (3) a single noun clause, (4) compound or 
parallel dependent clauses, (5) complex or secondary depen- 
dent clauses, (6) complex interrogative, (7) complex impera- 
tive, (8), complex exclamatory sentences.! Table 2 shows the 
1 Kinds of complex sentences. 
(a) With Single Adverbial Clause.—‘‘ A fact is not called a fact, but a 
piece of gossip, if it does not fall into one of your scholastic categories.’ — 
Stevenson, ‘Apology for Idlers.” 
(b) With Single Adjective Clause.—“ Many make a large fortune, who 
remain underbred and pathetically stupid to the last.””—Ibid. 
(c) With Single Noun Clause.—“‘It is supposed that all knowledge is at 
the bottom of a well, or the far end of a telescope.” —Ibid. 
(d) Compound-complex.—‘ When they do not require to go to the office, 
when they are not hungry and have no mind to drink, the whole breathing 
world is a blank to them.”—Ibid. 
(e) Complex-complex.— As if a man’s soul were not too small to begin 
with, they have dwarfed and narrowed theirs by a life of all work and no 
play; until here they are at forty, with a listless attention, a mind vacant 
of all material of amusement, and not one thought to rub against another, 
while they wait for the train.’”’—Ibid. 
(f) Complex-interrogative.—“ Do you really fancy you should be more 
beholden to your correspondent, if he had been damning you all the while 
for your importunity ?’”—Ibid. 
(g) Complex-imperative—“Even if your doctor does not give you a 
year, even if he hesitates about a month, make one brave push, and see 
what can be accomplished in a week.’’—Stevenson, ‘Aes Triplex.” 
(h) Complex-exclamatory.— Only, what a chequered picnic we have of 
it, even while it lasts! and into what great waters, not to be crossed by any 
swimmer, God’s pale Praetorian throws us over in the end!””—Ibid.

Of the complex sentences, about one-fifth contain only a 
single adverbial clause, and the same proportion a single 
adjective clause, while 16.9 per cent contain a single noun 
clause. Referring these ratios back to their proportion of the 
whole number of sentences, we find about one sentence of 
every eleven a complex sentence with a single adverbial 
clause; about the same ratio for complex sentences with a 
single adjective clause; and one of every twelve sentences is 
complex with a single noun clause. Over one-third of the 
complex sentences have secondary dependent clauses. 
The most striking fact about development in the use of 
complex sentences is seen in this complex-complex type. Here 
we find a variation from 5.7 per cent for fourth-grade pupils 
up to 44.1 per cent for the university upper-class students, 
with the adult average of 37.0 practically reached at the close 
of the high-school period. Table 3 shows in detail this pro- 
gression at different school levels. 
A glance at Table 3 shows that the progression is practically 
continuous, with the single exception of the slight excess in 
the seventh-grade material.

      What Shall We Teach about Sentence Forms?—From 
the facts that have been presented concerning the development 
of sentence mastery, it is apparent that certain refinements on 
sentence form which are sometimes made in the grammar 
course, such as the complex-interrogative, complex-impera- 
tive, complex-exclamatory, and the compound-complex sen- 
tence as distinguished from the complex-compound or the 
complex-complex may well be omitted on the basis of their 
infrequency. None of these types appears in more than 4 
per cent of the total number of complex sentences. When we 
consider the ‘tabular coefficient’! of 44.8 for the complex 
1 The term “tabular coefficient,’ which is used in a number of places 
further along, may be explained in this connection. In interpreting 
several of the tables it appears advisable to make special comparisons by 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
Kinds of Sentences We Use 29 
sentences in the total, the most numerous of these forms occurs 
only about once in every fifty sentences. 
The distinction between simple, compound, and complex 
sentences is more or less fundamental. So much in the matter 
of clauses hinges on the understanding of the distinction 
between complex sentences and the other two types. Viola- 
tions of sentence completeness often hinge on the lack of clear 
understanding of the principal and dependent clause distinc- 
tions. Important rules of punctuation hinge on both the 
compound and complex sentence structure. Refinements of 
classification, such as compound-complex and complex-com- 
pound are unwarranted on the basis of usage. 
The emphasis on the distinctions according to meaning,— 
the declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory 
forms,—seems far less important than distinction according 
to form. On the basis of usage the distinction according to 
meaning warrants no emphasis. The chances for error in 
punctuation of the interrogative and exclamatory sentences 
are so rare that this principle of variation can give very little 
claim for endless exercises in parsing. If emphasis is to be 
defended, it must be on other grounds. 
Methods of Teaching Sentences.—The data presented in 
this chapter warrant the conclusion that the pupil must gain 
a clear understanding of the difference between the three 
kinds of sentences as to form,—simple, compound, and com- 
plex. But so far as meaning is concerned, the study of these 
forms may be almost entirely limited to declarative sentences. 
The simple sentence being fundamental to the other forms, 
must be mastered thoroughly at the beginning, including a 
referring the totals in a sub-group back to the total number of words or 
the total number of sentences, especially the latter. This has been done 
largely to furnish a complete list of frequencies for such summaries as 
the above. A concrete illustration of the use of these tabular coefficients 
may be introduced here to show their significance in establishing general 
standards of frequencies for the subdivisions in the table. The method 
works out as follows: Of all simple sentences, 92.2 per cent are declara- 
tive. Of the total number of sentences 41.4 per cent are simple, which 
shows that 38.2 per cent of all sentences are simple declarative, obtained 
by multiplying 92.2 per cent by 41.4 per cent.   
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  30 How Much English Grammar? 
working understanding of the ideas of the subject and 
predicate. 
In respect to compound sentences, we have first the problem 
of overcoming the tendency of pupils to string two or more 
simple sentences into one. Our study seems to indicate that 
this type of sentence should be reduced from 63.6 per cent of 
the total number of compound sentences to approximately 
one-half that ratio. 
So far as the compound sentence is concerned, hast this will 
involve added mastery of the compound-complex sentences, 
for we find that adults average 62.1 per cent of the compound 
sentences with dependent clauses. Practically all through 
the grades and high school, student usage falls short of this 
adult average, while university freshmen and upper-classmen 
exceed the average. This second phase of the compound 
sentence problem will no doubt be solved in large part if we 
employ the proper kind of methods for increasing the student’s 
ability to use complex sentences. 
Our analysis seems to show that there is need for developing 
in the upper grades a larger use of the complex sentence con- 
taining a single noun clause and also the complex-complex 
sentence, if students of the upper grades and high school are 
to reach the adult standard. The proportions of complex 
sentences with single adverbial or single adjectival clauses in 
student writing compare with adult averages in such a way as 
to show excess percentages for both of these forms throughout 
the twelve years of school life above the fourth grade. 
The problem of teaching, then, consists largely in giving 
pupils practice in the use and control of the complex 
sentence. Certain types of complex sentences may as well 
be disregarded, notably those that are interrogative, impera- 
tive, and exclamatory in meaning. The greatest progress 
can be made with sentences containing a single dependent 
clause, and our problem is then shifted to a definite study of 
the kinds of dependent clauses,—adjective, substantive, or 
adverbial—that seem to be most used and most useful in 
every-day life. The discussion of this problem is the principal 
task of the next chapter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  
Kinds of Sentences We Use 31 
One point may be stressed here,—or: merely learning the facts 
about the classification of sentences, and acquiring the ability 
to apply this knowledge in the ready analysis and parsing of 
sentences has been tried, and must be admitted to have failed. 
Another method, the mastery by composition, is now being 
generally emphasized and mustbe given a fair trial. Devices 
in teaching must be worked out to induce the pupil to write 
and speak thoughts expressed in correct, varied, and versatile 
sentence form. ‘Two general lines of attack seem possible,— — 
either to lead the pupil to think so as to compel such expres- 
sion, or to require him to re-think and re-express thoughts 
presented to him in a form that shall be suitable for restate- 
ment involving practice in the forms desired. 
Such exercises will usually take on one of two forms,— , 
restatement of condensed material in amplified form, or 
restatement of amplified material in condensed form. We 
should make use of exercises involving the restatement of 
words in natural, equivalent phrases; of the restatement of 
phrases in clauses; of the recasting of simple sentences into 
compound and complex, and vice versa; and of the recasting 
of complex sentences of one type into those of another. 
The possibilities of this method of teaching a mastery of 
sentence form for the sake of variety, clearness, precision, and 
foree—the old “‘rhetorical’’ way of putting it—will be elabo- 
rated more fully in the following chapter, when we shall 
see what common usage indicates as to the forms of clauses 
and phrases that are probably a necessary means of daily 
expression. 
Examine Diagram III again, with this matter in mind. It 
may be seen that in the fourth and sixth grades we have the 
adult ratio of compound sentences with two or more simple 
clauses and of the compound sentences with complex clauses 
practically reversed. It would seem to be feasible in the lan- 
guage work in these grades to give the pupils extensive practice 
in converting some of their parallel independent clauses into 
equivalent dependent clauses. The new form in most cases 
will afford a more natural and precise expression of the 
intended meaning. The adult average compels such a con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  32 How Much English Grammar? 
clusion. Material for such exercises need not necessarily be 
sought in formal texts. A judicious selection from the written 
work of a class ought to give ideal opportunities for leading 
pupils into more accurate ways of thinking, in the revision of 
their first-thought expression.

CHAPTER III 
DEVELOPMENT IN CLAUSE CONTROL 
Problems in the Teaching of Clauses.—Our study of the 
sentence in the previous chapter led to the conclusion that the 
practical solution of the sentence problem in language mastery 
involves, mainly, constructive work with the dependent clause. 
The pupil must learn to use the various types of clauses in 
order to gain accuracy and variety in expression. 
In approaching the problem of the importance of clauses in 
our grammar and language work, we may set this functional 
aim in direct contrast with present practice. We may, at the 
outset, state some of the present problems relating to 
clauses, with the intention of seeing what light we may gain 
from the data we shall examine in this study. 
1. It will be useful to determine whether the time spent in 
grammar classes on the classification of adverbial clauses 
according to their use, and on noun clauses according to their 
construction, is worth while. : 
2. How important is it for pupils to learn the difference 
between restrictive and non-restrictive adjective clauses? 
3. How may we improve the pupil’s ability in sentence 
construction through his study of clauses? 
Before proceeding to analyze our data, it should be noted 
that in dealing here with the usage of clauses we are not 
dealing with the figures involved in the discussion of dependent 
causes in the previous chapter. There we were concerned 
with the sentence as a whole, and all dependent clauses that 
were secondary or even further removed from the principal 
clauses were not considered. Our analysis now involves all 
dependent clauses regardless of the kind of sentence in which 
they may be found, and regardless also of the extent to which 
they may be removed from the principal or independent 
elements of the sentence.

The Ratio of Clauses per Sentence.—We should first 
note the ratio of dependent clauses tthe number of sentences 
for all material. In 10,000 sentences there were 9,184 depen- 
dent clauses, an average of nearly one to a sentence, or .92. 
The adult average is slightly larger, .97. This is the standard 
used in the tables and diagrams in this chapter. 
Some extremes in the use of clauses may first be noted. 
The largest ratio of clauses to the number of sentences is found 
in the material from Stevenson, who uses 716 in 500 sentences, 
a ratio of 1.43 per sentence. Brisbane’s ratio is .76; William 
Hard’s is .44; Macaulay’s is 1.04. These extremes and the 
ratio of some of the other important groups of material may 
be seen by a glance at Table 4.

Table 4 means:—Stevenson uses, on the average, 143 depen-

of 97 by 46. At the other extreme, William Hard uses 44 
dependent clauses per 100 sentences, an average less than 
the adult average by 53 points on the same scale.

  Development in Clause Control 35 
We may now compare with this adult average and with 
those extremes in the matter of clause usage, the material 
collected from school work. The data are given in Table 5. 
When we come to analyze the kinds of dependent clauses 
found in the school material, we note, first, a gradually 
increasing number of such clauses in proportion to the number 
of sentences, as we proceed from the lower to the higher 
grades. Table 5 shows approximately one dependent clause 
to every fourth sentence used by fourth-grade pupils, one to 
every third sentence used by sixth-grade pupils, approximately 
one to each sentence used by university freshmen, and four 
to every three sentences used by university upper-classmen.

-P-A-G-E-34
36 How Much English Grammar? 
Comparing Tables 4 and 5, we find that William Hard has 
simplified his average sentence structure to about the same as 
that found in the fourth or sixth grade. Most of the news- 
paper material, the business letters of men, the letters of 
women, and the “‘light’’ fiction has about the same type of 
sentence, so far as the ratio of dependent clauses is concerned, 
as the composition work of high-school students. The 
sentence structure of university freshmen is about as complex 
as that of Macaulay, and the work of university upper-class 
students approaches the ratio of Stevenson. 
The Distribution of Dependent Clauses.—Regarding the 
distribution of the total number of clauses among the three 
types,—adverbial, adjectival, and substantitive,—Diagram IV 
‘indicates that each of these types constitutes approximately 
one-third of the total. To be exact, the adverbial clauses 
constitute 38.2 per cent of the total, the noun clauses 30.1 
per cent, and the adjectival clauses 31.7 per cent. This 
distribution was slightly changed in the items constituting the 
adult average, the percentages being, respectively, 36.7, 31.2, 
and 32.1. In the printed material there was a considerable 
shift in the substantive total, which is 35.7. In this group the 
adverbial clauses constituted 33.8 and the adjectival clauses 
30.5 per cent of the total number. This is accounted for 
by the fact that a large proportion of the newspaper material 
is included in the print composite and, because of the reduction 
in the total number of sentences involved, the characteristic 
  
upper-class material was included in the totals used to compute the 
“Adult Average,” and, as this involved about one-eighth of the total 
amount of adult material, the tendency for the university material to 
approximate the average used as a standard will be beneficially affected 
in a slight degree. This will not, however, affect the comparison of the 
other school material with the adult average. 
1(a) Adverbial Clause.—The bird was singing when we passed. 
(b) Adjectival Clause.—The bird which we heard singing was an oriole. 
(c) Substantive Clause.—He did not believe that the world was round. 
The various types of adverbial and adjective clauses, and the various 
construction for substantive clauses will be illustrated in detail in subse- 
quent sections of this chapter.
-P-A-G-E-35
  
Development in Clause Control 37 
newspaper construction of a noun clause used as the object of 
verbs of saying, and the like, was given undue weight. 
The averages that we thus derive as to the relative frequency 
of the three types of clauses indicate that, other things being 
equal, the adverbial, adjectival, and substantive clauses 
should claim about equal attention in a course in grammar.

From Table 6 we gain some indication as to the extreme 
variation, in the use of clauses among writers or types of mate- 
rial on the basis of adult averages. The table presents 
the excesses over the adult average and the deficiencies in the 
relative proportion of adverbial, substantive, and adjectival 
clauses. The greatest extremes were selected for these dia- 
grams, as well as a number of items more closely resembling 
the average. If we eliminate from each column the same 
three items,—the two conversational sections from the fiction 
material, and the Associated Press material,—we find the 
adult material grouped quite closely about the average. Then 
if we consider the variation of these three classes of material,
-P-A-G-E-36
    38 How Much English Grammar? 
we see at once that it is the large excess of noun clauses that 
accounts for the extremes in all three of the clause types, for 
the excess in one is accompanied by a corresponding deficiency 
in the other two. Later, in examining the noun clauses in 
these three groups of material, we shall find that these 
extremes are largely due to the frequent use of noun clauses 
as objects of a verb. (See Table 11.)

The conversational sections of Wright and Oppenheim, in — 
respect to the prominence of noun clauses, are almost double 
the adult average. This is explained as being due to the 
introductory statements accompanying the speeches of 
characters in the story. Similar excesses over the average 
have already been referred to in connection with the Associated 
Press material as being due to the newspaperman’s tendency 
to guard all statements by quoting authority. In the Wright
-P-A-G-E-37
  Development in Clause Control 39 
conversational material this type of noun clause constitutes 
90.1 per cent of all noun clauses; in the Oppenheim conver- 
sational sections, 86.7 per cent; and in the Associated Press 
material, 76.4 per cent.. (See Table 11.) If we refer these 
percentages back to the total number of clauses, we find this 
single type of noun clause in the construction of object of a verb 
constitutes respectively 28.1, 27.1, 27.8 per cent of all depen- 
dent clauses in these three groups of material. 
When we distribute the dependent clauses found in school 
work of the different grades into the three groups of adverbial, 
noun, and adjective clauses, we get a striking revelation of 
the development of these phases of linguistic expression 
among pupils at different levels. 
Data presented in Table 7 show trends of development 
so decided that they should influence our distribution of lan- 
guage work in the schools, and should help us in the selection 
and grading of material in the grammar course. 
Table 7 shows that the percentage of noun clauses in the 
total number of clauses increases from approximately 10 per 
cent to 31 per cent, practically the adult average, from the sixth 
grade to the close of the high school and then recedes to about 
21 per cent in the work of the university upper classmen. 
The adverbial clauses show a decrease, in a general way, 
from about 51 per cent in the sixth grade to 42 per cent in 
the university upper classes. In the use of the adjective 
clauses, in general, the frequency runs from about 25 per cent 
in the seventh grade to 36 per cent in the university upper 
classes. The figures for the fourth grade are an exception 
to the general trend in respect to noun and adjective clauses, 
possibly because of the limited amount of material examined 
for this grade. In the case of the adjective clauses, the 
figures for the sixth grade also show an exception to the 
general trend, for we find that the percentage of adjective 
clauses is 39.2 of the total number of dependent clauses. 
Just as we noted in the discussion of complex sentences 
with single adverbial clauses*that there was a decline from 
a considerable excess over the total average in the grades to an 
approximation to the average in the university material, so

  we find the same tendency when the total number-of clauses 
is considered. Diagram V shows the clause trends in relation 
to one another. It may be noted as quite a marked feature 
in the use of noun clauses that there is a rapid increase from 
about 10 per cent in the sixth grade to a little over the adult

When we consider that none of these types occurs more 
frequently than once in ten sentences, and that most of them 
occur only once or twice in a hundred sentences, the energy 
often spent in schools in making logical distinctions for the 
sake of being able to parse adverbial clauses seems waste- 
fully expended. Further, these distinctions are of little 
value in helping pupils to overcome the common errors in 
speech. Where the logical value of a clause may determine 
the mode of a verb in a highly inflected language, such as 
Latin or Greek, this refinement may be valid; but there seems 
little justification for introducing such treatment into an 
English grammar course. All exercises and explanations 
involved in the classification of adverbial clauses should be 
abandoned. ‘ 
It may prove interesting to compare the order of frequencies 
for different types of adverbial clauses from the develop- 
mental point of view. In three of the groups we find pupils 
in the grades exceeding the average, viz., in “time,” ‘ cause,” , > , , 
and “result” clauses. In clauses of “manner,” ‘ place,” 
“degree.” “condition,’’ and ‘‘concession,” the grade pupils 
fall below the average. In a general way, in the “time” 
clauses, we find a constant decline from a large excess percent- 
age over the average in the grades to about the adult, average 
in the university. (See Table 9.) In ‘‘manner” we find 
(See Table 10.) an approximately similar increase to the aver- 
age with a striking exception, however, in the sixth grade. In 
“degree” (See Table 9.) we again note decided evidence of 
development from 4.4 to percentages slightly above'the adult 
average of 22.8 in university material. In ‘“‘causal’’ clauses, 
(See Table 10.) all of the school material shows arather striking 
uniformity of excess throughout, with a gradual increase in the 
grades and high school, and a recession in the university 
material. In the “result’’clauses (See Table 10.) the develop- 
ment seems to be in the direction of eliminating them from the 
excess in the upper grades to a point about the adult average 
in the upper high-school and university years. The students’ 
control of the ‘conditional’ clause (See Table 9.) shows a 
slight development during the grades, from zero in the sixth,
-P-A-G-E-42
  44 How Much English Grammar? 
through the high-school period and recession toward the aver- 
age in the university classes. As a striking contradiction to 
this, however, is the fourth grade material, which exceeds the 
average. 
The more important developmental trends are shown in 
detail for some of the classes of adverbial clauses in Tables 
9 and 10. There were too few ‘‘place,” ‘purpose,’’ and 
“evidence” clauses to indicate trends.

        The conclusion to be derived from this analysis indicates 
that on the basis of natural usage, adverbial clauses of ‘‘time,”’

receive attention in the grades; and clauses of ‘‘concession,” 
“place,” and “purpose” in the high school; and that on the

Referring some of these kinds of noun clauses back to 
their frequency in the total number of clauses, by multiplica- 
tion with the tabular coefficient of 30.0, the percentage of 
noun clauses in the total, we find noun clauses as objects of a 
verb in 19.8 per cent of all sentences, practically every 
fifth sentence. In the same way we estimate a noun clause 
in apposition with a pronoun as constituting 2.8 per cent of 
all clauses, and as occurring in 2.5 per cent of all sentences,— 
every fortieth sentence. The construction in apposition 
with a noun constitutes 2.7 per cent of all clauses and occurs 
in 2.4 per cent of all sentences. The predicate attribute 
construction is found in 1.5 per cent of all clauses and 1.4 
per cent of all sentences. 
All of these clause types are more or less important from 
the point of view of presenting two possible chances for error. 
It is not an uncommon mistake to find the introductory

word “that” repeated in connection with such clauses, especially 
when another clause, usually out of its natural order, is intro- 
duced as a modifier of some element in the noun clause.! 
There is also quite a common and natural tendency to commit 
error by the use of unnecessary commas before introductory 
words, especially where the clause is in apposition with a 
noun.?

in the construction of the object of a verb. In the sixth and 
seventh grades all noun clauses are in this construction, but 
the proportion from that point on diminishes rapidly to 45.1 
per cent for high-school seniors, but increases again in the 
work of university freshmen and upper classmen to 69.3 
and 76.1 respectively. This carries it back to practically 
the adult average of 74.5 per cent. The development is

tables in this chapter, brings out the fact that in almost every 
ease the high-school junior material is exceptional; time and 
again we notice an extension for this class in the direction of 
the general trend of development. If the trend is from an  
-P-A-G-E-47
  Development in Clause Control 49 
excess to the average, the junior class material seems a year or 
two ahead of the trend; and the same condition frequently 
holds when the trend is from a deficiency in the lower grades 
toward the adult average in the upper levels. 
Referring to Diagram V this close approximation to the 
adult standard by high-school juniors can be seen in an even 
more striking way in the usage of all types of dependent 
clauses. ; 
Adjective Clauses.—When this study was planned, the 
adjective clauses were divided into the two groups of restric- 
tive and non-restrictive, or determinative and descriptive,’ 
because of the emphasis put upon this classification in most 
grammars, largely due to the fact that the distinction forms 
the basis of an important rule for the use of the comma which 
is often violated. The insistence on this rule for the sake 
of clearness seems warranted. But the fact brought out here, 
that the restrictive clauses, which do not require the comma, 
so largely predominate, somewhat modifies the need for this 
insistence. So does the fact that the purposed omission is 
becoming more and more common in current usage, especially 
in newspaper writing. 
It is most significant, however, that the non-restrictive 
clause is so prominent proportionately in the writing of 
the immature. All grade and high-school material exceeds the 
average, the grade material being twice to three times the 
average in the matter of non-restrictive clauses. As will be 
shown later, the error quotient for the failure to set off non- 
restrictive clauses is high in all school material, practically 
one-half of the chances being missed. 
Aside from the school material the non-restrictive clause 
seems to be prominent in narrative material, and especially 
in newspaper writing. (See Diagram VI.) 
1 Tllustrations of the kinds of adjective clauses. 
(a) Restrictive or Determinative.—He seized the gun that was nearest

Restrictive and non-restrictive adjective clauses appear 
in the adult material in about the ratio of 4 to 1. Because 
of its importance in the matter of error in punctuation, the 
non-restrictive clause should be related back to the total 
number of sentences and clauses. With about one dependent

non-restrictive, we may expect to find such a clause as should 
be set off by the comma in 18.6 per cent of the sentences. 
A further analysis of the adjective clauses shows that there 
is a striking indication of development in the school material 
in the way of a decrease in the proportion of non-restrictive 
clauses used and a corresponding increase in the number

Development in Clause Control 51 
of restrictive clauses. The development is readily seen in 
Diagram VII. 
The peculiar contradiction to the general trend in the fourth 
grade material must be noted. There must be more than an 
accidental selection involved. It seems reasonable to expect 
that, if the investigation were extended over all the lower 
grades, we might again find a regular reversal to the trend

by pupils at about the sixth grade. The significant fact about 
the matter is that there should then be such a generous use of 
the non-restrictive clause. It is easy to understand that this 
element is then employed to take up a large part of the “run 
on” sentence structure. The collection and analysis of further

material for the purpose will, no doubt, reveal some interesting 
traits in the development of sentence control. Such a study 
could easily be made by any English teacher in the inter- 
mediate grades and would yield helpful material for the teach- 
ing of the sentence. 
Questions of Method in Teaching Clauses.—In summa- 
rizing our results on the matter of dependent clauses and 
making practical application of the results, we should note the 
following: 
1. Exercises in classification for adverbial and noun clauses 
have no value. The time spent on such parsing should be 
saved for other purposes. 
2. The study of discrimination between restrictive and non- 
restrictive adjective clauses is important. 
3. Language exercises should be carefully graded with a view 
to teaching pupils of various grades how to build up sentences 
containing clauses of various types. Some of these types are 
clearly shown to be quite beyond the natural language habits 
of grade pupils, and some are beyond the natural modes of 
expression of high-school students. 
4. Exercises in sentence-building, such as were suggested in 
Chapter II, i.e. in substituting clauses for words and phrases, 
can and should be carefully arranged on the developmental 
basis.

CHAPTER IV 
PHRASES AND NON-MODAL VERB FORMS 
Prepositional Phrases.—We now turn to consider phrases, 
first the prepositional forms and then those involving some 
non-modal verb forms used as phrase modifiers.+ 
On the basis of frequency of usage, prepositional phrases 
are very important. They also offer an important field for 
investigation in the matter of errors, as we shall see in Chapter 
X. Even in university upper-class compositions, we find 
Uy - 
Adjeotival 39.5% Adverbial 60.5% 
Diacram VIII.—Showing proportion of adjectival and adverbial types of 
prepositional phrases in all material. 
that the use of wrong prepositions is one of the most persistent 
faults. While this is not distinctively a grammatical matter, 
but rather one of diction habit, still it must be considered in 
this connection, and will be taken up later with the whole 
question of error. 
There was a total of 23,036 prepositional phrases used in 
the 10,000 sentences examined. This gives a ratio of 2.3 
per sentence. In respect to type, 39.5 per cent of the phrases 
are adjectival and 60.5 per cent are adverbial. (See Diagram 
VIII.) This distinction as to type has some significance in 
regard to the content of the grammar course, as we shall see 
presently. 
The ratio of prepositional phrases per sentence in adult 
material was slightly larger than the ratio for the total 
1 TIlustrations of the two kinds of prepositional phrases. 
(a) Adjectival—The man on the box wore a cap with a visor. 
(b) Adverbial—We tried to look over the cliff.

material, being 2.45 per sentence. Some of the extremes 
ought also, perhaps, to be noticed, in order to suggest a stand- 
ard of comparison for the development of phrase usage in 
the composition work in different grades in school. This is 
shown in Table 14.

There is a correlation of +.77 between the total number 
of phrases used in school material and the number of adjectival 
phrases used. 
We find, therefore, as shown clearly in a general way, 
in Table 15, that the development of sentence mastery with 
reference to kinds of phrases used is very largely a matter 
of increased use of adjectival phrases; that the adult averages, 
so far as the use of the two types of phrases is concerned, are

approximated during the last three years of high-school work; 
and that in the material of university students there is again a

Teaching Implications.—So far as this study of the two 
groups of prepositional phrases should affect our plans for 
school work, it would seem to indicate that in the grades and 
early high-school period exercises might well be worked out 
to increase the use of the adjectival phrase modifier. 
If the clear presentation of thought in sentences is set as 
the objective in the grammar course, it would appear that 
exercises should be devised which will increase facility in the 
use of adjectival phrases.
-P-A-G-E-55
  Phrases and Non-modal Verb Forms 87 
It would seem that exercises of this sort might be built up 
by giving the pupil single-word adjective modifiers to work 
over into adjectival phrases. Or direct exercises might be 
assigned which would require the pupil to add phrase modifiers 
to nouns and pronouns in model sentences set before them. 
That this would be in the line of natural development from 
the kind of writing done by young persons to that done by 
adults in every-day life seems evident. 
Correlations between Clauses and Phrases.—Correlations 
were worked out to show the relationship between phrases 
and clauses of the adjectival and adverbial type. 
The correlation in all items of adult material between the 
ratios of adjectival phrases and adjectival clauses per sentence 
is +.66, as roughly computed by the Spearman formula. 
The correlation for the items of the school material alone is 
+.69. 
The correlation in all items of adult material between the 
ratio of adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses per sentence 
is +.56, as roughly computed by the Spearman formula. 
The correlation for the items of the school material alone is 
+-..67, 
These high correlations give further confirmation of the 
natural developmental character of mastery over the logical 
relationships involved, and add to the argument made in 
the previous chapter that we shall soon be able to find a 
satisfactory objective basis for grading much of our material 
in the language course. 
Non-modal Verb Forms.—In taking up other phrasal 
elements used as modifiers, the non-modal verb forms should 
claim our attention next. 
These forms—the infinitives, participles, and gerunds'—are 
all quite important so far as frequency of usage is concerned. 
Characteristic types of errors emphasize this importance. 
1 Tllustrations of non-modal verb forms. 
(a) Infinitive-—He refused to see his sister. 
(b) Participle-—She sat there sewing leisurely. 
(c) Gerund.—Seeing is believing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  58 How Much English Grammar? 
This general statement of conclusions is made here because 
in our discussion we shall have to deal with a number of 
sections in the grammar courses that must be eliminated or 
treated with quite a different emphasis from that which is 
now common in school practice. Much of the material relat- 
ing to these non-modal forms in the texts, except in a few of 
the more recent books, deals with uses of the infinitives and 
with the constructions of substantive infinitives. It would 
seem advisable, from criteria of both usage and errors, that 
all such material should be eliminated, while material having 
reference to “‘split infinitives,”’ the genitive case used with the 
gerund, and especially the distinction of past participle and 
past tense forms would prove far more helpful. ; 
The data upon which the above suggestions are based may 
be presented under the following heads: 
1. The total number of all non-modal verb forms and their 
ratio per sentence. 
2. The relative percentage of each of the three types and 
their ratio per sentence. (a) Infinitives, (6) participles, 
(c) gerunds. 
3. The relative frequency of the various uses of the infini- 
tives, as adjective, adverb, substantive, etc., and the ratio 
of each per sentence. 
4. The relative frequency of the different constructions 
of substantive infinitives and the ratio of each per sentence. 
5. The relative frequency of the present and past participle 
forms. 
6. The Gerunds. 
All of the facts may first be presented in a diagrammatic 
way. The shaded portion in the area below may be taken 
to represent the ratio of all non-modal verb forms,—73 to 
every 100 sentences.

into proportionate parts for the various uses of this form, as 
adjectival, adverbial, etc., and the area for the participles 
into proportionate parts for the present and past participle 
forms.1 In each of the areas the ratio of the subdivision per

  Each of the topics dealing with non-modal verb forms may 
now best be presented by noting (1) the averages in all material 
analyzed; (2) the extremes in usage in each of the forms; 
(3) and the developmental trends in the school material for 
each of the types of constructions. We shall be especially 
interested in noting the details of the relative frequencies of 
the uses of infinitives and construction of substantive infini- 
tives, because it is in respect to these matters that so much 
energy has been spent in grammars of the parsing type. 
We find the total number of these non-modal verb forms— 
the infinitives, gerunds, and participles—occurring in the ratio 
of about .7 per sentence, or seven to every ten sentences. 
The infinitives constitute over one-half of these, —56.8 per cent; 
the participles, 27.0 per cent; and the gerunds, 16.2 per cent. 
If we use the tabular coefficient .7 for the total non-modal 
verb forms, we find an infinitive in about four of every ten 
sentences, a participle in about two of every ten sentences, 
and a gerund in every eighth sentence. The present and past 
participles are divided about equally,—54.9 and 45.1 respec- 
tively of the total number of participles. This would give 
about one of each of those forms for every tenth sentence. 
Most grammar text-books go into a great deal of detail 
as to the uses of infinitives, and to their construction, if they 
happen to be used substantively. Of the different uses 
commonly distinguished, we find that 35.2 per cent of the 
1Compare Table 17.
-P-A-G-E-59
  Phrases and Non-modal Verb Forms - 61 
infinitives are substantive; 24.1 per cent, adverbial; 17.0 
per cent, complementary; 13.6 per cent, adjectival; 9.7 per 
cent in infinitive clauses; and .2 of one per cent, independent. 
These percentages might be referred back to the total number 
of non-modal verb forms used, but it will perhaps be more 
to the point to show the relative frequencies of these uses for 
the total number of sentences. This gives us one substantive 
use in every seventh sentence; one adverbial in every tenth 
sentence; one complementary in every fourteenth sentence; 
one adjectival in every nineteenth sentence; one infinitive 
clause use in every twenty-fifth sentence; and one independent 
in every one-hundredth sentence. The relative importance 
of the different infinitive uses is shown in Table 17.

Referring back to the diagram on page 59, it was shown 
that participles constituted 26.9 per cent of the total number 
of non-modal verb forms used as modifiers. Of these 54.9 
per cent are present participles and 45.1 per cent past parti- 
ciples. The former occur about eleven times in 100 sentences, 
and the latter nine times in one hundred sentences. ! 
1 The number of participles here given does not include the present or 
past participle forms used as parts of a verb phrase. To secure the total 
number of participles a careful analysis would have to be made of the 
facts tabulated in connection with the verbs and verb phrases. For 
example, to the number of past participles would have to be added all 
those tense forms like the perfects, and the number of passive verbs, or 
verb phrases. To state the total of present participles, one would have 
to add the total of progressive forms,
-P-A-G-E-60
  62 How Much English Grammar? 
In the same connection it was shown that 16.1 per cent 
of the non-modal verb forms were gerunds, and that about 
twelve such were found in every one hundred sentences. 
Adult Extremes in Non-modal Verb Forms.—We may next 
note some of the adult extremes in the use of non-modal 
verb forms. Table 19 shows the variations for all non-modal 
forms taken together, and Table 20 shows the variations for 
infinitives, for participles, and for gerunds respectively. 
All of the ratios in Tables 19 and 20 may be read as “per 
100 sentences” by dropping the decimal points; thus, in the 
business letters there are 105 non-modal verb forms in every 
100 sentences, and so on.

Having the general facts about usage of the non-modal 
verb forms before us, we may now return to a further 
consideration of the infinitive uses and constructions, which 
are given so much emphasis in the grammar text-books.

Regarding the relative values of different uses of the infini- 
tives, we may make an analysis of some of the adult averages.

infinitives, about 42 to every 100 sentences. If we classify 
these 42 according to use, we find 15 are substantive; 9, 
adverbial; 8, complementary; 6, adjectival; and 4, infinitive 
clauses. 
This shows what a slight basis there is in frequency of 
usage for the amount of space in text-books devoted to the 
construing of substantive infinitives. The total as well as 
the adult average show the ratio per 100 sentences for all 
substantive infinitives to be but 15. Grammar texts fre- 
quently distinguish as many as eight or nine constructions of 
substantive infinitive’. Referring back to Table 18, we see
-P-A-G-E-62
  64 How Much English Grammar? 
that three of these constructions include 86 per cent of all 
the substantive infinitives.* : 
But the most significant fact, so far as the necessity for 
instruction is concerned, is that the use of these constructions 
does not involve a likelihood of error. It seems futile, there- 
fore, to drill on debatable refinements that can in no way 
contribute to language control in school years, when even 
an accurate knowledge of them is of little or no advantage 
to the adult stylist. The complications involved in an analy- 
sis of some of these constructions may well lead one to feel 
that their occasional recurrence is merely the result of an 
unusual intricacy of thought or a remnant of idiomatic 
expression. 
But one further item of adult usage need be noted. 
The facts about the use of participles, presented in general 
in Table 20, show a wide range of practice. The adult average 
shows 22 participial modifiers to every 100 sentences. The 
usage of some writers nearly doubles this ratio, while with 
others we find half of the adult average, and in conversational 
material this tends to run even to less than one-third the 
average. 
School Usage of Non-modal Forms.—We may now compare 
the usage in school material with these extremes and with 
the adult average.2 This may best be done on the basis of 
the ratios per sentence as shown in Tables 21 to 26. 
1 Compare also page 61. 
2 There is an interesting confirmation in much of the material in the 
present study of the practise in mental test standardization of making 
the 16-to-18-year-old mental age equivalent to adulthood. Language 
control may fairly be assumed to be one of the most reliable general 
indications of mental ability. The present study indicates that this 
index of mentality is as clearly shown by mastery of sentence structure 
and other grammatical technique as by vocabulary control. The data 
presented in the diagrams warrant the statement that the ‘adult aver- 
ages”’ are attained at about the age of 16 to 18, and that there is an almost 
invariable trend toward that average in the grades below high-school 
sophomores and juniors. In this connection Diagram X and Table 
22 may be examined. The fact that high-school seniors and college 
students usually exceed the adult average in the direction of these lan- 
guage development trends has an importat educationcnal signifiance also.

Table 22 shows the development in the use of infinitives 
from a ratio of 19 or 20 per 100 sentences in the intermediate 
grades to 42, near the adult average standard, in the junior 
year of the high school. The high-school sophomore and 
senior material is irregularly in advance of the general trend.

A complete set of tables was worked out to show the develop- 
ment in school material in the use of different kinds of infini- 
tives and in the various constructions of substantive infinitives. 
But only a few of these can be given. 
The development in the use of substantive infinitives is 
shown in Table 23, and the trend in the use of substantive 
infinitives in the direct object construction, the most important 
one, is shown in Table 24. 
Table 25 shows the development of the mastery of parti- 
ciples, which at certain levels of school work attains about 
two-thirds of the adult standard.

Suggested Revision of Grammar Courses with Reference to 
Non-modal Verb Forms.—As a result of our study of the fre- 
quencies of usage of the various forms and constructions 
of the non-modal verb forms, especially the infinitive, we may 
now summarize some of the revisions that have been suggested 
incidentally in preceding paragraphs.

intricate of these refinements,—the uses of the infinitive, 
and the constructions of substantive infinitives. In short, 
the criterion of frequency of usage condemns the selection of 
material for study on the basis of logical completeness or on 
the analogies of classical grammar. 
2. On the whole, it would be better to devise exercises to 
stimulate the freer use of all the non-modal verb forms as 
modifying elements.. And this is especially necessary in the 
case of participles. With this suggestion in mind, Tables 
21, 22, 25, and 26 should be re-examined. The best stage for 
work with the infinitives and gerunds would appear to bein the 
upper grades, a satisfactory approach to the adult average being 
attained in the high school. But there is reason for a strong 
emphasis on the use of participial modifiers, not only through- 
out the high school, but even in English work in the university. 
The value of the participle as a means of attaining clear and 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  70 How Much English Grammar? 
concise expression is well-known. The deficiency in the use 
of participles throughout the school material (see Table 25) 
is one of the most striking evidences of our failure to attack 
the problem of sentence control by direct means. 
3. The above criticism suggests two faults in our present 
grammar courses,—an over-emphasis on several topics 
connected with the infinitive, and a failure to give constructive 
exercises to stimulate easy usage of a valuable rhetorical 
device. A further need for reconstruction, or a transfer of 
emphasis, may be suggested here, but must be left for fuller 
development in Chapter X. Each of the non-modal verb 
forms presents possibilities of grammatical or rhetorical error, 
often of a serious character. The data concerning these errors 
to be presented later give an additional reason for the modi- 
fication of grammar courses suggested above.

Some Adult Extremes in the Use of Each Part of Speech.— 
We should now examine some of the extremes in the relative 
proportion of each of the parts of speech found in the total 
number of words in certain of the typical adult writings. The 
facts for each of the parts of speech, except interjections, which 
occur too infrequently to warrant attention, are presented 
in Table 28.

But little comment on the individual columns seems neces- 
sary. In respect to the nouns, the newspaper material shows 
a striking excess of noun usage, the extreme excess being 
fully one-third of the adult average. The conversational 
material stands at the other extreme. 
Just the reverse is true in the case of pronouns, which 
might have been expected in view of the nature of the material. 
The extremes are not so decided in the case of verbs, and 
there is no grouping of material to warrant generalization.
-P-A-G-E-71
Relative Importance of Parts of Speech 73 
In the case of adjectives, we find three types of material 
at the excess extreme, the rather exuberant sociological 
material of Chenery, the narrative with descriptive elements, 
and the superior classical material. The Herald editorial 
material is also of the exuberant type. At the other extreme, 
we find the deficiency of adjectives most prominent in the 
conversational material. 
The conversational material shows the largest excess in 
the proportion of adverbs used, while the newspaper material 
and the business letters are most lacking in adverbs. 
The proportion of prepositions, which implies mastery 
of phrase usage, is found in excess in the better prose and in 
the condensed news writing. 
Conjunctions are used in excess in two types of writing, 
the loose and the finished. We find representatives of each 
at the excess extreme in the table. The largest deficiency 
of conjunctions in comparison with the adult average is in the 
Associated Press material. This has already been explained 
as a practical device in news writing in connection with the 
types of sentences discussed in Chapter II. Brisbane’s 
material, found near the extreme, may be explained as due 
to his free use of the short complex sentence. 
Development in School Material in the Use of Each Part 
of Speech.—We may now note some of the developmental 
trends in the school material studied. Tables 29, 30, and 31 
show the trends. 
Speaking generally, there is an approach through the grades 
and the high school to the adult average in the use of nouns, 
with a recession in the university years. (See Table 29.) 
In the matter of pronouns there seems to be a general 
tendency toward decrease in usage from about twice the adult 
average in the fourth grade to a little less than the adult 
average in all of the high-school material.. There is a slight 
excess over the adult average in the university material.

      The proportion of verbs in the total number of words is 
practically constant at a slight excess over the adult average 
throughout all of the school levels and in the university. 
(See Table 30). 
The use of adjectives shows a gradual development through 
the grades until the adult average is reached, just before the 
high-school period. During the high-school period there is a 
slight excess during all the four years, but there is a return 
to the adult average in the university years. - (See Table 30.) 
The fourth, sixth, and seventh grade material shows an 
excess over the adult average in the use of adverbs. The 
high-school material throughout is practically at the adult 
level, while the university material shows a tendency to exceed 
the adult average. (See Table 30.)

Relation of Usage to the Content of the Grammar Course.— 
We cannot judge on the basis of frequency of the different 
parts of speech alone which should receive the chief emphasis 
or what relative importance should be given to each in con- 
structing a course in grammar. Complexity of form, variation 
in inflection, and the chances for error in each case must all 
be taken into consideration. The problem must be solved 
in view of the detailed consideration of each of the parts of 
speech in relation to the average sentence, and in view also 
of the frequency with which the complicating factors connected 
with each part of speech appear in usage. We shall find that 
some of these factors have evidently been given too much atten- 
tion, while others have been slighted, in courses that have been 
constructed largely with a view to attaining logical complete- 
ness in detail, and to including in English grammar all those

minutiae with which grammarians are familiar in classical 
grammar. Exercises in courses in grammar are often arti- 
ficially selected to illustrate uncommon usage, or they are 
laboriously culled from recondite literary storage. Such 
illustrative exercises have in many cases become a tradition 
in the text-books on the subject of English grammar. 
One who is familiar with the typical text-book in grammar 
knows that the attention given to parts of speech has largely 
been determined by the number of grammatical forms and 
details that had to be presented in order to give a complete 
discussion, from a logical point of view, of each topic treated. 
As_a result, verbs are given more space than nouns or adjec- 
tives; pronouns are given more attention than nouns, adjec- 
tives, or prepositions. A more detailed statement covering 
this point will be made in a later chapter when a summary 
will be presented of the results of a study of a number of text- 
books in grammar which show the absence of any satisfactory 
basis for determining the relative value of the minor divisions 
of grammar. It will also be shown that in the newer texts 
there is a singular tendency to modify the aim of logical 
completeness and balanced treatment by some consideration 
of frequency of error in grammatical usage. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  CHAPTER VI 
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT NOUNS AND 
PRONOUNS 
The Present Emphasis in the Grammatical Treatment of 
Nouns and Pronouns.—In the conventional grammar course, 
nouns and pronouns are given a great deal of attention. The 
problem we are setting ourselves is to determine whether this 
emphasis is warranted on the basis of usage, or whether it is 
misplaced. 
Two topics occupy the major part of the grammar texts and 
the school course in dealing with each of these two parts of 
speech,—viz., case constructions and classification. Adult 
usage, as shown in the following pages, indicates that such 
emphasis is not in accord with practical needs. 
The discussion of case construction is undertaken for the 
purpose of showing that a topic in logical grammar may be 
important in one connection, while in another it may be of 
little consequence. The relative frequency of the different 
case constructions in nouns and also in pronouns will first 
be considered, and then the topics relating to the classification 
of each of these parts of speech will receive attention. 
Case Construction of Nouns.—Strictly speaking, we cannot 
distinguish more than two case forms for the noun,—first, 
the form in nominative, dative, and accusative constructions, 
which in some grammars is dealt with as the “‘common case;”’ 
and second, the genitive or possessive case form.! In the 
following discussion, however, the theoretical division. of 
1 Illustrations of nouns in the four possible case forms. 
(a) Nominative-—The man found his place soon. 
(b) Genitive (or Possessive).—The man’s coat was torn. 
(c) Dative.—He gave the man his pay. 
(d) Accusative (or Objective)—The man found his place soon. 
78 
   
-P-A-G-E-77
  Nouns and Pronouns 79 
nouns in the four cases is observed, for the purpose of deter- 
mining the relative frequency of each of the four forms. This 
is necessary in order to establish the relative importance of 
the one case form, the genitive, which differs from the others, 
in comparison with the total number of nouns. Infrequency 
of usage of the recently introduced dative case also shows how 
little practical basis there may sometimes be for the text-book 
maker’s worship of the fetich of logical completeness. 
There are a number of case constructions of nouns found so 
infrequently that there can be no excuse for retaining them 
in an elementary course in grammar even if ignorance of them 
involved possible error in oral or written expression. These 
may first be enumerated. 
Let us recall, as a basis of some of our calculations, that- 
nouns constitute about 24.2 per cent of the total number of 
words in common usage, and that we find four or five to 
every sentence.! 
Of all nouns nearly 27 per cent are theoretically in the 
ominative case, 71.2 per cent in the accusative, and .2 of 
one per cent in the dative. In other words, 98.4 per cent 
of all nouns are in the “common case,” i.e. have the same, or 
unmodified form. The remainder, then, 1.6 per cent, are in 
e modified genitive or possessive form. 
This simple presentation of the facts would suggest that 
the whole matter of the declension of nouns is a needless 
waste of time, if we have regard to frequency of use only. 
Since no change of form is necessary, and no record of 
error is found, in connection with the infrequent dative, 
any need for special study of this logical construction as a 
distinct case may be ignored from this point on. 
If it were not for the high frequency of error found in 
writing the genitive case, infrequency of usage would advise 
that but slight attention be given to this case. ‘ The prevalence 
of error in the use of this case suggests a more direct attack 
upon the causes of error than is found in the memorizing of 
noun declensions or the parsing of constructions. Error in 
usage is also frequently due to the fact that the genitive case 
1See Chapter V, page 71 and page 72.
-P-A-G-E-78
  80 How Much English Grammar? 
is so often used to express meanings other than possession, and 
this would indicate that an understanding of the significance — 
of the genitive needs to be made clear. This matter is quite 
generally neglected in the text-books. Here again we con- 
front a problem that cannot be solved directly by the memoriz- 
ing of declensions or the parsing of constructions. 
Six constructions for the nominative case of nouns are 
usually dealt with in the texts, (1) as subject, (2) as predicate 
attribute, (3) as appositive, (4) as address, (5) as exclamation, 
and (6) as absolute with a participle.! Of these the last three

When we come to the theoretical accusative construction 
of nouns, we find grammar texts usually dealing with eight 
or nine possible types,—(1) direct object, (2) object of preposi- 
tion, (3) appositives, (4) adjunct or factitive accusative, (5) 
adverbial, (6) predicate, (7) retained object with the passive

voice, (8) subject of infinitive.1 Some texts discriminate 
the forms after “like, unlike, near, next, or as” from the 
prepositional construction. 
The réle which each of these constructions plays among the 
total number of accusatives is shown in Table 34. 
It has already been noted that the genitives comprise 
1.7 per cent of all nouns. The significant fact, usually dis- 
regarded in most texts, is that only 15.3 per cent of the geni- 
tives express possession, while 83.1 express ‘“connection,’? 
and 1.5 per cent function as modifiers of gerunds. (See 
Table 33.) 
In Chapter V,* the adult extremes in the use of nouns in 
relation to the total number of words was shown. Inthe same 
connection,‘ the trend in school material as to the proportionate 
number of nouns in the total number of words was presented.

tions, when all nouns are parsed theoretically according to the 
conventional technique of grammar; but, for the sake of 
brevity, the tables and diagrams prepared to show this usage 
have all been eliminated. They all served to reenforce the 
conclusion we have already been led to,—that many of these 
constructions occur so infrequently that little heed should be 
paid to them in an elementary course in grammar.

Case Uses of Nouns in School Compositions—Table 35 shows 
the trend in the use of nouns in school compositions. This 
table may be compared with Table 29 on page 74. In the 
latter connection it may be said that in Chapter V the relative 
proportion of nouns in the total number of words used was 
shown. Now we have a representation of the ratio of nouns 
per sentence. In both tables we find the same general condi- 
tion illustrated,—a gradual and regular increase in the use of 
nouns. But here the development is shown in a more striking 
way, as proceeding from about one-half the adult standard in 
the intermediate grades to practically the adult average usage

university students’ writings.

            material is on the deficiency side. (See Table 35.) But the 
development from one-half the adult ratio in the fourth grade 
to about the adult standard by the close of the high-school 
period is quite regular throughout. The fact that there are 
some irregularities in the trend, and that there is a recession 
during the college period, indicates that the nature of the 
subject-matter plays some part.

subject construction; about 16 per cent are predicate attri- 
butes; and 7.3 per cent are appositives.? 
Table 37 indicates that the use of nouns in subject construc- 
tion develops more regularly and rapidly than their use 
in the predicate attribute construction. The variation in the

2See Table 32, page 80. 
   
-P-A-G-E-84
  86 How Much English Grammar? 
appositives is too irregular to speak of a development, but it 
is worth noting in Table 37 that almost all school material 
is strikingly defective in the use of appositives when compared 
with the adult average. 
Genitive Case Usage—The genitive case data in Table 36 
are significant. All school writings betray a shrewd avoidance 
of the troublesome forms. 
Accusative Case Usage-——The accusative case of nouns has 
been shown to include over 71 per cent of all nouns.1 Two 
constructions, the object of a preposition and direct object, 
constitute fully 92 per cent of all the accusatives.? One 
other construction, the appositive, occurs with sufficient 
frequency to be included in Table 38. In Table 36, which 
represents the total usage of accusatives in school writing, we 
note first that the adult average ratio is never reached, 
though closely approached at about the close of the high 
school. Up to this point there is a regular development from 
about one-half that ratio in the fourth grade. 
In the two principal constructions, shown in Table 38, 
there is evidence of a more sudden mastery of the direct 
object construction than that of the prepositional objective. 
Irregularities in the trend, however, indicate that we cannot 
altogether disregard the probable effect of the nature of the 
subject-matter as a factor in the variations. In Table 38, 
we see further evidence of the inability or disinclination to 
use appositives. All school compositions are below the 
adult standard in this usage. 
The second column of Table 38 should be compared with 
Table 16 on page 56, which shows the development in the 
use of prepositional phrases regardless of whether the object 
is a noun or pronoun, and also with Table 46 on page 98, 
which shows school practice in the use of the accusative 
case of pronouns in the construction of object of a preposition. 
The following facts are brought out by such a comparison:— 
(a) There is a very close correspondence between the 
development in the total phrase usage and in those phrases 
1 See page 79. 
2See Table 34.

Nouns and Pronouns : 87 
having a noun for the object of the preposition. This is 
largely accounted for by the fact that in most material about 
90 per cent of the objects of a preposition are nouns.* 
(b) But, more significant, it will be seen from Table 46 
that pupils in the grades and high school seem consistently 
to avoid using pronouns also as object of prepositions, prob- 
ably because of the chance for error.

The Teaching of Nouns.—(1) In estimating the value of the 
conventional material on noun constructions presented in 
grammar text books, we now have a basis for testing the values 
1 Compare Tables 38 and 46.
-P-A-G-E-86
  88 How Much English Grammar? 
involved in the fine distinctions that are often made. What 
effect does a construction have on the form that is to be used? 
Unless a noun is to express possession, connection, or one of 
the characteristic relationships involved in the genitive case, 
or unless it is used as a modifier of a gerund, no ingenuity will 
be needed to choose the right form. What difference does it 
make whether a noun is used as subject or as predicate? Why 
insist on the pupil’s being able to distinguish between the nomi- 
native of address and the nominative of exclamation? Why 
worry about the case of appositives? Even if all such nomi- 
native and accusative constructions can be parsed, the whole 
refinement will add nothing to the pupil’s language mastery. 
The whole logical refinement involves the learning of six 
reasons for the nominative construction, and of eleven for 
the accusative. 
Table 32 shows that over 90 per cent of all nominatives 
are either subject or predicate attribute, and 7 per cent more 
are appositives. This leaves the nominatives of address and 
of exclamation and the absolute use with the participle less 
than two per cent of all nominative constructions and with a 
combined ratio of 1.5 to 100 sentences. 
Similarly, Table 34 shows that over 92 per cent of all 
accusatives are accounted for by two constructions; while 
most of the 11 possible constructions are too infrequent to 
warrant any expenditure of school time. 
In short, parsing as usually practiced involves a waste 
of time on refinements of construction rarely found in every- 
day expression. 
(2) The time of a language class devoted to the study of 
nouns should be spent on: 
(a) The use of the correct forms of the genitive case. 
(6) The proper understanding of the ‘‘non-possessive” 
uses of the genitive case. 
(c) A freer use of appositives. 
(d) A freer use of prepositional phrases. 
(3) Perhaps the most significant fact about the use of nouns 
in school compositions is the evidence of a consistent evasion 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
Nouns and Pronouns 89 
of the first three constructions noted above, because of the 
chance for error involved in each. . 
The whole time devoted to nouns in a course in grammar 
might profitably be spent on these four topics alone. 
Constant drill exercises, in sentence context, for correct use of 
genitives, whether ‘possessive’ or “connective” in meaning, 
should be held throughout the upper-grade and high-school 
courses in English. 
The freer use of appositives and prepositional phrases can 
best be secured by practice on direct exercises requiring the 
insertion of these types of modifiers. More specific analysis 
of the needs with reference to prepositional phrases was made 
in Chapter IV. 
In correcting themes any evidences of circumlocution to 
avoid the use of these constructions should be marked for 
revision to discourage the tendency to evade the difficulties. 
This may be defended on the basis of the value of each of these 
constructions in the achievement of brevity and exactness of 
expression. 
Case Usage of Pronouns.—In Chapter V,! adult extremes in 
the use of pronouns in relation to the total number of words 
were noted. In the same connection? the trend in school 
material as to the proportionate number of pronouns in the 
total number of words was presented. 
The problem of the case construction of pronouns is very 
different from the problem in noun usage. Here one 
of the most important elements of inflection enters. A 
change in meaning involves a change in form. Nearly one- 
half of the pronouns used are in some case other than the 
nominative, and correct usage requires a knowledge of the 
declension involved. Further, because of this variety of 
forms, we find that even some of the nominative constructions 
involve possibilities of error. Again, as will appear in a later 
section of this chapter, the more highly inflected classes of 
pronouns, the personal and relatives, comprise about 85 per 
cent of all pronouns. 
1See Table 28. 
2See Table 29.
-P-A-G-E-88

However, there are a number of constructions in each of the 
cases occurring so infrequently as to require but little emphasis 
in @ course in grammar, even if ability to identify the construc- 
tions were an aid to correct or effective expression, which is 
doubtful. 
As a basis for computing the significance of some of these 
forms it must be recalled! that pronouns constitute 10.7 
per cent of the total number of words used, and that we usually 
find about two to every sentence, counting all possible types 
and forms. 
Of all pronouns, 57.9 per cent are in the nominative case, 
18.6 per cent in the genitive, 1.3 per cent in the dative, and 
22.1 per cent in the accusative case.2 (See Table 39.)

  Tables 40 to 42 show the relative importance of the various 
constructions for the nominative, genitive, and accusative 
cases, 
On the basis of frequency alone, the parsing or identification 
of various constructions in the nominative case does not 
seem to be worth while. But the predicate attribute con- 
struction, though comparatively infrequent, involves a possi- 
bility of error that is a common pitfall, and we must consider 
this in teaching grammar. The overcoming of this common 
fault can be achieved only by an understanding of the construc-

This emphasizes the need for a different treatment of the geni- 
tive case from that generally given in the grammar courses. 
There must be a more direct attack on one of the common 
sources of error in the use of this case, although the genitive 
pronoun forms do not involve the same possibilities of error 
as the same case in the noun forms. 
In the accusative case uses of pronouns we see the same 
striking condition found in the noun constructions in this 
case. Again, only two of the constructions are frequent. 
The direct object and object of preposition constructions 
constitute about 90 per cent of all accusatives.! Six of the 
possible constructions occur so infrequently that together 
they constitute but three-tenths of one per cent of the total 
accusativesused. Another case form, the adverbial accusative, 
which amounts to 2.9 per cent of the total usage, is counted 
as such only by a technical logical refinement that is sometimes 
open to dispute; and even when interpreted as a case form it 
usually involves no inflection. Most of these are adverbial 
uses of the indefinite pronouns ‘‘much,” “many,” ‘more,’ 
“less,” as in the phrase “weighed more.” The details about 
the usage of various constructions are shown in Table 42.

Case Uses of Pronouns in School Material—Table 43 
shows the variations in the use of pronouns in school com- 
positions. This may be compared with Table 29 on page 74. 
In Chapter V, we were able to trace quite a marked trend
-P-A-G-E-93
Nouns and Pronouns 95 
in relative decrease in the proportion of pronouns in the total 
number of words used. The decrease proceeded irregularly 
from about double the adult standard in the fourth-grade 
compositions to less than the adult average in all high-school 
writing, with a slight excess over the adult average in the 
university compositions. 
On the basis of ratios per sentence (See Table 43.) we can 
merely speak of variation, for no regular trend appears; the 
nature of the material seems a more determining factor than 
the stage of development.

Perhaps the most striking fact shown in Tables 43 to 46 
is the deficiency in the use of pronouns in all the cases, when 
compared with the adult average, throughout the grades 
and the high-school period. There is but one exception 
in Table 43, which presents the usage of all pronouns in 
school compositions. That exception is in the fourth-grade 
material. It has already been noted that this material 
consisted of a series of letters telling about the children’s 
own experiences. A comparison of Tables 44 and 45 with
-P-A-G-E-94
    96 How Much English Grammar? 
43 will show that three-fourths of the pronouns were “I” 
or “he” used as subjects of sentences. 
The evidence as a whole indicates a period of three or 
four years in the upper grades and early high-school years 
when a consciousness of the difficulty in handling pronouns 
leads to a constantly increasing tendency to avoid them.

Further, in comparing school compositions with adult 
usage, we find that in all the elementary grades the ratio of 
genitives per sentence exceeds the ratio of accusatives. From 
_the beginning of the high-school period the relative pro- 
portion of the two cases conforms with the adult practice. 
(Compare Tables 45 and 46.)
-P-A-G-E-95
  Nouns and Pronouns 97 
The developmental trend in the use of the genitive case of 
pronouns (See Table 45.) is interesting. Throughout the 
grades and high-school years there is a deficiency in comparison 
with the adult average. In a general way this deficiency 
appears to become increasingly greater through the grades and 
the first two years of high school. Then an equally decided 
trend toward the adult average sets in, and in the upper classes 
. of the university an excess appears. A comparison of the 
second and third columns in Table 45 will show that this 
trend is practically dominated by the connective constructions

a nature as to emphasize the need of developmental exercises 
with connective genitives, if this construction has any expres- 
sional values, and if the adult average may be taken as a 
desirable one for pupils to attain in their language mastery.

Accusative Constructions of Pronouns.—The strict avoidance 
of pronouns in the construction of object of a preposition 
throughout the grades and high-school period cannot be 
overlooked. In general about one-half the standard adult 
usage is found in all school compositions analyzed below the 
university level. (See Table 46.)

This is partly accounted for by the inability of students to 
use prepositional phrases freely. No school group, even 
including university students, was found that reached the adult 
average practice. (See Table 46, and compare Table 15, 
page 54.)
-P-A-G-E-97
  
Nouns and Pronouns 99 
The possibility of error in the use of pronouns after a 
preposition no doubt leads pupils to avoid this construction 
if a cirecumlocution is at hand. That this is a plausible 
explanation has been pointed out in several other connections, 
where school compositions show consistent deficiencies in 
usage in those grammatical constructions which involve 
high probabilities of error. 
Usage of Various Classes of Nouns.—Considerable space 
is devoted in most grammars to the classification of nouns 
according to their meaning. Some variation is found in 
details; but, aside from the useful distinction between common 
and proper nouns, much time is often spent in classifying 
common nouns into such subclasses as concrete, abstract, 
material, and collective! On the other hand, very few gram- 
mars call attention to the rapidly increasing use of nouns 
as adjectives, which in some of the newspaper writing of to-day 
often exhibits a cumulation of three or four noun modifiers 
of a single word, and to the substitution of nouns for adjectives 
when a ‘common adjectival form is available. 
Only two phases of the classification of nouns have any 
practical significance in language mastery,—first, the recogni- 
tion, for purposes of capitalization, of all proper nouns; and 
second, the recognition of collective nouns because of possible 
difficulties in respect to subject and predicate agreement. Of 
all discriminations attempted in this study, on the basis of 
conventional nomenclature, none was so difficult and unsatis- 
factory as the classification of common nouns as concrete 
or abstract; but the distinction was persisted in because of a 
growing conviction that even an approximation of the relative 
frequencies of these two classes might have considerable value 
in the study of mental development at different school levels. 
1 Illustrations of the various classes of nouns. 
(a) Concrete (Common).—The rope was made of hemp. 
(b) Abstract—John drew the bundles of fagots up with ease. 
(c) Proper.—John drew the bundles up.

(e) Collective—John drew the bundles up. 
(f) Material—tThe rope was made of hemp.

The relative frequency of the various classes of nouns found 
in all material is shown in Table 47. About one-half 
of all nouns—48.8 per cent—are abstract; about one-fourth— 
24.6 per cent—are concrete, and 17.7 per cent are proper. 
The adult ratios per sentence are as follows: all nouns, 4.21; 
common (concrete) .93; abstract, 2.10; proper, .81. Of the 
remaining classes we find 25 nouns used as adjectives in 
every one hundred sentences; eight collective and four material 
nouns in 100 sentences.

Adult Usage of Different Classes of Nouns.—Table 48 
presents the adult extremes in the use of different classes of 
nouns. 
A number of significant tendencies may be briefly noted :— 
1. The material nouns are so infrequent as to be negligible. 
2. The most extreme variations from the average are 
found in the use of proper nouns. This can very evidently 
be attributed to the nature of the subject matter. (See 
column 4, Table 48.) 
3. One would hardly expect proper nouns to exceed con- 
crete nouns. Yet this is true of four groups of writings,—in 
Macaulay, and in three varieties of newspaper writing,— 
R. H. Little, Associated Press, and Herald editorials. (Com- 
pare columns 1 and 4.) 
4, Nouns used as adjectives also present wide extremes. 
Perhaps the most significant fact is the excessive use of such
-P-A-G-E-99
Nouns and Pronouns 101 
constructions in some of the newspaper writing and in business 
letters. (See column 5.) 
5. Abstract nouns average about one-half of all nouns 
in ratio per sentence. But it is not necessarily true of adult 
writing, as might be superficially expected, that excessive use

          of abstract nouns is accompanied by a corresponding deficiency 
of concrete nouns, and vice versa. In fact, the correlation 
between the ratios of concrete and abstract nouns per sentence 
is very near zero,—.15. 
For four of the twelve items in columns 1 and 2 there is a 
strong inverse relationship, Brisbane being first in the ratio 
of concrete nouns per sentence and last in the ratio of abstract 
nouns; the Herald editorials eleventh and first respectively 
for concrete and abstract; the Associated Press, eighth and 
second; and women’s letters third and tenth. The rest 
rank practically the same in the use of both classes of nouns.  
-P-A-G-E-100
  102 How Much English Grammar? 
This table should be compared with Table 50 which deals 
with school compositions. There is a large negative correla- 
tion,—.63, between the items in the latter table. There is, 
with the exception of the fourth-grade and the university 
upper-class material, a fairly marked trend toward a decrease 
from an excessive proportion of concrete nouns, with a regular, 
striking increase in the use of abstract nouns. The exceptional 
character of the fourth-grade material is accounted for by the 
disproportionate use of pronouns in the first person singular. 
It must, therefore, not be overlooked that the character of 
the material is an important factor also. 
Classes of Nouns Used in School Material.—The adult aver- 
age ratio of 4.87 nouns per sentence is reached about the first 
year of high school. The progress to that point is gradual 
from the fourth grade on, where the ratio of nouns per sentence 
is about half of the adult. Throughout the high school the 
ratio continues to increase to an excess of about 25 per cent, 
and in the university material it drops below the adult average 
again. 
In a general way there is a trend in the grade and high-school 
material from double the adult ratio in the number of concrete 
nouns to approximately the adult proportion by the close of 
the high-school period. (See Table 50.) But the extreme 
deviations from this general trend in both the lower and 
upper university groups, the former to a striking deficiency 
and the latter to an equally striking excess, warn one against 
placing too much significance on the trend. Other factors, 
such as the character of the subject, must be controlled before 
we can attach much importance to the development.! 
There are, of course, reciprocal facts in the ratios of abstract 
nouns in the different school grades. There is a constantly 
increasing trend from the sixth grade through the university 
freshman material, a regular advance from .45 per sentence 
to 2.80 per sentence. The adult ratio of 2.42 per sentence is 
reached by the senior class of the high school. But the fourth 
grade and the university upper class material runs counter to 
the general trend quite strongly. (See Table 50.)

Approximation to the adult standard in the use of proper 
nouns is reached by the eighth grade, and the ratio remains 
fairly constant throughout the high school. But in the 
university material we again get ratios which indicate that 
other factors must be quite as important as age and school 
progress. (See Table 51.) 
Practically the same thing is true concerning the use of 
nouns as adjectives. (See Table 51.) The material and 
collective noun groups are too small to give us anything of 
significance in a developmental analysis.

        The material noun hardly appears in school compositions 
at any level. Collective nouns are relatively so infrequent 
that we are hardly justified in making any analysis from a 
developmental point of view. Only 259 collective nouns

Usage of Various Classes of Pronouns.—The adult ratio 
of pronouns per sentence is 2.11. Textbooks commonly 
distinguish nine classes of pronouns according to meaning.’ 
Four of these may be admitted to be important on the basis 
of frequency of usage. Of all pronouns 72.7 per cent are 
personal, and the fact that this class involves important 
changes in declension forms for case, number, and even gender, 
makes this frequency doubly significant. The ratio per 
sentence is 1.48. The relatives, which also involve some 
inflectional changes, are next in importance, though far 
below the personals, on the basis of frequency. They con- 
stitute 11.9 per cent of all pronouns, and we find 24 to every 
100 sentences. The indefinite pronouns constitute 8.7 per 
cent of the total, with 18 for every 100 sentences. The demon- 
stratives constitute 3.9 per cent of the total, and we find 
eight in every hundred sentences. The remaining five 
classes, the reflexive, interrogative, reciprocal, intensive, and 
identifying, together constitute only three per cent of all 
pronouns, and we would expect to find about six of these forms 
in 100 sentences. (See Table 52.) The facts summarized 
above will show that detailed presentation of any but the 
four most frequently used classes of pronouns can serve no 
practical purpose.” 
The variations in adult usage of all classes of pronouns are 
shown in Table 53. 
1 Tllustrations of classes of pronouns according to meaning. 
(a) Personal.—I saw him go away. 
(b) Relative—This is he of whom I have often spoken. 
(c) Indefinite—‘ Many are called, but few are chosen.” 
(d) Demonstrative-—This is easy, that would be hard. 
(e) Reflexive——He saw himself doing all the work. 
(f) Interrogative—Whom seek ye? 
(g) Reciprocal.—They sought each other for a year. 
(h) Intensive-—He vowed he himself would go. 
(t) Identifying.—This box was the same I had lost.

    Classes of Pronouns Used in School Material—In the ratio 
of pronouns per sentence, as can be seen in Table 54, there 
is evidence of a late developmental trend in the school work 
examined. Throughout the grades and the four years of 
high school, the ratio of pronouns per sentence is slightly 
but consistently below that for all adult material. However,
-P-A-G-E-106
  108 How Much English Grammar? 
the deficiencies are irregular, which leads to the conclusion 
that the nature of the material is also an important factor. 
The two succeeding tables indicate that this is largely 
true for the total number of pronouns because it is so strikingly 
true of personal pronouns, which, it will be recalled, constitute

nearly three-fourths of all pronouns. It may seem pertinent 
to give a general indication of the nature of the material that 
was analyzed. Taking the four groups that show a large 
excess in personal pronouns in Table 55, we find the university 
upper-class students presenting their views ‘on social and 
educational problems, which, in fulfillment of the assignments, 
called for illustration from personal experience and observa- 
tion. Most of the university freshmen wrote on “The 
Friend I Like Best” or “The Study I Have Enjoyed Most 
This Year,” 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  
Nouns and Pronouns 109 
One group of seventh-grade pupils wrote on the picture, 
“The Song of the Lark,” and treated, in large part, of the girl 
and of the artist. The fourth-grade pupils wrote letters 
about their school life. On the other hand, the topic assigned 
for the four high-school classes was quite impersonal, ‘Some 
Current Event.”

When we examine the remainder of the pronouns as they are 
presented in Tables 55 and 56, we probably have a residue that 
presents a fair picture of developments in language control. 
In the use of relative pronouns there is a constant and quite 
regular development from practically none in the fourth grade 
to almost double the adult average in university upper-class 
writing, with the adult standard attained at about the upper 
years of the high school. In the matter of indefinite pronouns
-P-A-G-E-108
110 How Much English Grammar? 
we find quite a regular trend from one-fourth the adult 
average use in the sixth grade to double that standard in 
university freshman work. (See Table 56.) But the fourth- 
grade material and the university upperclass compositions 
do not prevent our feeling that the nature of the material 
is still present as a factor. Practically the same situation 
is shown for demonstrative pronouns in Table 55, although 
the development seems slightly more rapid and a little less 
regular. 
Criticism of Courses in Grammar in View of Usage.—Now 
that we have the facts as to common usage before us, and 
find little justification for the elaborate treatment of case 
construction of nouns and for the classifications of nouns and 
pronouns, we may draw some conclusions for teaching. ~ 
1. The detailed emphasis on case construction of nouns 
seems entirely unwarranted. Usage gives little justification 
for fictitious formal distinctions where these do not really 
exist. The formal distinctions have been introduced for nouns 
even where the case forms are lost. The distinctions were 
artificially made, either because of the analogy of distinctive 
case forms in pronouns, or as a preparation for such distinc- 
tions in foreign-language grammar, where they do exist and 
must be learned. It would be out of place to discuss the 
justification of this phase of English grammar for the sake of 
furnishing a foreign-language background. We are justified 
merely in asserting that usage does not warrant much emphasis 
on case constructions of nouns. 
2. On the other hand, in the study of pronouns, this empha- 
sis on case construction is warranted, and is vitally necessary 
for successful language mastery. This applies to declension 
forms of demonstrative, relative, and interrogative pronouns 
as well as of personal pronouns. 
3. The distinctions in classification of both nouns and pro- 
nouns must also be admitted to be futile. These classifications 
are logical inventions with little functional value in language 
mastery. Of all the classifications of nouns, only the least 
frequently used, the collective, give occasional reason for 
variations in syntactical relationships. The distinctions
-P-A-G-E-109
Nouns and Pronouns 111 
as to classes of pronouns involve refinements, for the sake of 
logical completeness in the grammar texts, that are used 
very rarely. 
4. Moreover, two common types of error, the improper use 
of personal for demonstrative pronouns, and the use of the 
wrong case forms for the relative or interrogative, are not 
avoided by a knowledge of the logical distinctions involved. 
The time spent on the learning of classifications might more 
profitably be employed in direct drill on proper usage in 
respect to these few treacherous phases of language control. 
Drill in proper contexts to train the ear is advised as a substi- 
tute for classification exercises. 
5. If we must have declension of nouns, there is practically 
no justification, on the basis of frequency of usage, for the 
recent addition of the dative case, taken up by grammar 
texts as a result of the N. E. A. Nomenclature Committee’s 
Report, and little justification for the dative distinction in 
pronouns. 
6. In the declension of nouns the identification of the 
nominative and accusative forms in a “common” case seems 
justified, though frequency of usage can hardly be used as an 
argument in the matter. 
7. The substitution of the word “genitive” for “ possessive”’ 
gains justification from the fact that frequency of usage 
shows that ideas of relation, source, etc., far outnumber the 
purely possessive implications of this case for both nouns and 
pronouns. 
In the genitive case we see from Table 41 that the pro- 
portion of connective and relationship uses exceed the strict 
possessive use by a ratio of more than six to one. It must 
be admitted that the distinction often involves logical hair- 
splitting and that a suggestion to introduce a new refinement 
in construction seems inconsistent with the general movement 
to simplify technical grammar by elimination of non-essentials. 
But just at this point one of the most serious classes of error 
originates; and one who has analyzed a considerable quantity 
of the composition errors of pupils cannot help feeling that 
many of the youthful sins of omission of the apostrophe are 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
112 How Much English Grammar? 
involved in the failure to recognize the need for the genitive 
form where no idea of possession is involved. Such common 
expressions as “the day’s work,” ‘‘a month’s pay,” are promi- 
nent in the group of “apostrophe errors.”’ Usage proportion 
indicates this as one of the topics that has been neglected 
in most technical grammars. 
8. Further, in connection with the genitive, we cannot 
disregard the fact that school compositions betray a shrewd 
avoidance of the genitive form of nouns. This should not be 
allowed to continue. The confidence born of mastery of the 
troublesome apostrophe must be one of the products of school 
work, even if prolonged drill be necessary. There is no 
circumlocution that is acceptable from the point of view of 
clearness or brevity. 
9. Two constructions—object of a preposition and the direct 
object—again include over 90 per cent of all nouns in the 
accusative case. Yet many grammars devote considerable 
space to most or all of nine other infrequent possibilities. 
Since none of the constructions involves a change of form from 
the ‘common case,”’ there seems little justification for the time 
given to such exercises. The full effect of the argument must 
appear at a glance at Table 34, where some of the construc- 
tions are too infrequent to appear in the scale. 
10. In connection with both the nominative and accusative 
cases of nouns we saw that school compositions betray a 
deficiency in the use of appositives. This is a construction 
too valuable in attaining a condensed style of expression to 
be neglected. Exercises making a larger call for mastery of 
this construction must be supplied in the language course. 
Practice in the use, even though it be artificially provided, 
may well take the place of the parsing of such constructions. 
If the troublesome comma is the cause of a conscious avoid- 
ance of this construction in pupils’ writings, we have both an 
added reason and a more natural opportunity for practice on 
this rule, which will reduce its prominence as one of the 
leading punctuation errors.

  CHAPTER VII 
VERB FORMS MOST FREQUENTLY USED 
Variety and Importance of Verb Forms.—Nearl; ‘th 
word we use is some form of a verb. It was foundin the analy- 
sis of all simvaniat hat 10.4065 beat of all words were verbs. 
In English grammar, as in that of most other languages, 
the verb gets the largest share of attention because of the 
multiplicity of forms in inflectional changes, and because of the 
large amount of irregularity in the conjugation forms. 
On the basis of both frequency and complexity, as well as 
the resulting chance for error, extended treatment of this part 
of speech seems warranted. Some of the forms, introduced 
or retained for completeness, may probably be given more 
summary treatment than is customary, if we may apply 
the criterion of infrequent usage. Suggestions looking 
toward revision will be summed up at the close of the chapter, 
after the facts about usage are fully before us. 
We have already noted, in Chapter V, the adult extremes in 
the use of verbs in relation to the total number of words. In 
the same connection! the trend in school material as to the 
proportionate number of verbs in the total number of words 
was presented. 
The topics to be taken up in this chapter, both from the point 
of view of adult usage and the trends found in school writing, 
are the following: 
1. The relative frequency of regular and irregular verbs. 
2. Transitive, intransitive, and copulative predicates. 
3. Frequency of the different persons and numbers of finite 
verbs. 
4, Voice. 
5. Mood. 
1 See page 75. 
113
-P-A-G-E-112
  
114 How Much English Grammar? 
6. Tense. 
7. The use of auxiliary verb forms. 
Regular and Irregular Verbs.—Of the total number of words 
we use, verbs constitute about one-fifth, including every ele- 
ment in a verb phrase, as well as the predicates where a verb 
with any voice, mood, or tense form is involved; and also all 
auxiliaries and the use of ‘‘to be” in the progressive form and 
of “do” in the interrogative, negative, and emphatic forms, 
as well as such auxiliaries as “should,” “would,” ete., used to 
express mood ideas. The total of these forms gives us prac- 
tically four verbs of some sort for every sentence. Of these, 
34.4 per cent are regular and 65.6 per cent irregular.1 The 
Dracram XI.—Proportion of regular and irregular verbs in all material. 
latter, however, include the bulk of such auxiliaries, voice, and 
tense forms as ‘“‘to be” and “to have.” With these forms 
included, we have practically five irregular verbs for every 
two sentences. Or, stating it another way, we have about twice 
as many irregular as regular verbs. (See Diagram XI.) On 
the basis of frequency of usage, then, it seems that a great deal 
of attention should be given to the matter of irregular verbs, 
which cannot be done without a considerable basis of knowledge 
about the conjugation of regular verbs for comparison. The 
importance of irregular verbs has already been emphasized, 
on the basis of frequency of error, in Dr. Charters’ study.? 
We may present the extremes of adult usage of both regular 
and irregular forms in conspectus in a single diagram,— 
1 Tilustrations of regular and irregular verbs. 
(a) Regular—When I walk here, I think of how often he has walked 
here, and*of why he walked here. 
(b) Irregular.—When I go there, I think of how often he had gone there, 
and of why he went no more.

second. The Helen Herald material assumes a direct 
“chatty” style, and the “confidential” nature of the women’s 
letters naturally leads to a familiar conversational manner in 
writing. 
Equally striking is the fact that the newspaper material, 
with a large strain of narrative, tends to the opposite extreme, 
while the straight narrative of fiction yields the largest 
proportion of regular verbs.

irregular verbs per sentence. The same items of material

The diagrams show important facts. Stevenson, in whom 
is found a larger ratio of verbs per sentence than in any 
other writer examined, uses them in practically the same pro- 
portion as the adult average. Stevenson’s regular verbs are 
35.9 per cent of the total; his irregular verbs 64.1 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-115

Practically the same proportion holds for Hard —36.5 per cent 
regular; 63.4 per cent irregular. In ratio of verbs per sentence 
Hard’s material stands almost at the other extreme from 
Stevenson’s.

      note a slight trend from the lower to the higher levels toward a 
decrease in the proportion of irregular verbs in the total 
number of verbs used; but all school material exceeds the 
adult average in the proportion of irregular verbs used. 
This fact is established only when the number of regular and 
irregular verbs is compared with the totals of verbs used by 
each class. It can be seen best in Table 57, where all the facts 
are brought out in conspectus. When the irregular verbs are 
considered alone on the basis of ratios per sentence, the trend  
-P-A-G-E-116
  118 How Much English Grammar? 
toward an increase in the ratio of irregular verbs per sentence 
is clearly seen, although the development does not appear to 
be so consistent when the ratios are considered relative to the 
total number of verbs used. 
Taking the total number of verbs used per sentence, 
the development toward an increase is steady throughout the 
school period, with the adult average not attained until the 
university is reached. The initial ratio is about 60 per cent 
of the adult average in the fourth and sixth grades. (See 
Table 57.) 
The Importance of Principal Parts—It may be of some 
interest to attempt a comparison between regular and irregular 
verbs, if we eliminate from the latter class all those common 
irregular forms used in any way as auxiliaries, whether these 
be as voice, mood, or tense aids in verb phrases. This can be 
done by adding items in several of the tables used as a basis 
for these facts and subtracting the several totals from the total 
number of irregular verbs. We shall then have some indica- 
tion of the relative frequency of those irregular verbs on which 
so much of the drill and memorization work is often placed, 
in the learning of the principal parts or the conjugation 
paradigms or synopses. 
The relative proportion of such forms as “‘be, was,” 
“were,” “has been,” “have been,” “has,” ‘‘have,” “had,” 
_ “do,” “did,” “will,” “shall,” “should,” “would,” ete. can 
be seen in general from the total figures for all material and for 
the adult material. 66

    From these figures we can calculate percentages of frequency 
for those irregular verbs which are usually given in grammar 
lists for the purpose of memorizing principal parts and for 
practice on paradigms. Such irregular verbs constitute 
28.6 per cent of all irregular verbs in all material, and 25.1 
per cent in adult material. The few auxiliary verbs are used 
about three times as often as all other irregular verbs put 
together. All the non-auxiliary irregular verbs occur about 
one-half as often as the regular verbs, the ratios being about 
13 to 7 in all material, and 11 to 5 in adult material.
-P-A-G-E-118
    
120 How Much English Grammar? 
This must be understood as only a close estimate of the 
other irregular verbs. Slight allowances must be made for 
such untabulated facts as the following: 
(a) “Were,” used in a few subjunctives. 
(6) Any of the common auxiliaries may be used as single 
finite verbs in the imperative mood; e.g., “Do your 
work.” 
(c) Similar possible uses in the infinitive for ‘‘do.” The 
sentence, ‘Be sure to do your work”? would combine 
b. and c. 
Transitive and Intransitive Verbs.—Examining the predi- 
cate and non-modal verb forms from another point of view 
we find that 58.4 per cent are transitive, 20.4 per cent are 
intransitive complete, and the rest are copulative.! Of 
these copulative verbs, the forms of the verb “to be” con- 
stitute 18.9 per cent and other copulative verbs 2.3 per cent 
of the total number. Because of the importance of a dis- 
crimination between intransitive and transitive verbs in the 
matter of the direct object, especially in pronouns, it is evident 
that time spent on this classification is worth while. (See 
Table 59.)

  Verb Forms 121 
In the discussion dealing with transitive and intransitive 
verbs it must be borne in mind that there is included a count of 
verbs and verb phrases used as finite predicates, and also 
non-modal verbs or verb phrases. This accounts for apparent 
discrepancies in tables and diagrams in this section and other 
sections dealing with verbs from the point of view of regularity, 
tense, person, and number. 
Adult Extremes in Use of Transitive and Intransitive Verbs.— 
Table 60 shows the adult extremes in the use of transitive, 
intransitive, and copulative verb forms in terms of ratios per 
sentence. 
The irregular changes of place with reference to excess and 
deficiency in comparison with the averages in Table 60 indi- 
cate that the usage is largely a matter of chance, as we cannot 
even generalize about the various types of prose involved.

connection with the trends in the use of transitive, intransitive, 
and copulative verbs in the writing of school children. 
The ratio of transitive verbs per sentence may in general 
be said to be one-half or two-thirds of the adult standard in

the fourth, sixth, and seventh grades. This deficiency is 
steadily overcome as the pupil advances in high school, and 
nearly reaches adult average usage by the sophomore year.
-P-A-G-E-121
  Verb Forms 123 
From that time on there is but slight variation from the adult 
standard. (See Diagram XIV.) 
The variation is not so pronounced or so uniform in respect 
to intransitive verb usage. But there is some evidence 
of a reciprocal relation between the use of transitive and of 
intransitive verbs. 
In the same way we note a marked regular development in 
the use of the copulative verb ‘‘to be,” from about two-thirds 
of the adult average usage in the grades to almost double the 
adult standard in the university upper classes. The vari- 
ation in the use of other copulative verbs is irregular, and since 
they constitute such a small proportion of the total, are not 
shown in the diagram. 
Applications to Language Teaching.—All phases of verb 
usage in the transitive, intransitive, and copulative classes are 
of sufficiently frequent occurrence to warrant attention in a 
grammar course. But the facts brought out by this consider- 
ation of usage relate to the matter of methods of teaching 
rather than to relative emphasis in the grammar course. 
Technical grammar courses have given considerable atten- 
tion to classification at this point. It seems clear that an 
understanding of the nature of transitive verbs, with the 
noun or pronoun object, especially the latter, should afford 
some help in avoiding errors that are rather common. This 
would be specially important with certain common irregular 
verbs that were referred to in the previous section of this chap- 
ter. Beyond these it would probably be difficult to prove any 
functional values for such classification exercises. 
Another method is suggested in connection with develop- 
mental trends in comparison with adult usage. The deficiency 
in the use of transitive verbs is striking in the grades, and is 
hardly up to the adult standard before the close of the 
high school. Practice must be provided for the mastery of 
the correct case use of pronouns in object constructions. 
Abundant exercises of the sentence-completion type are 
perhaps the best teaching device. 
A further suggestion in this connection is the need of building 
up language habits with pronouns in the attribute construction
-P-A-G-E-122
124 How Much English Grammar? 
after copulative verbs. While the variations from the adult 
average in all types of copulative verbs are irregular, it is a 
significant fact that throughout the grades and high school 
there is a considerable deficiency in the ability to use copula- 
tive verbs. In order to provide practice for the habit of 
correct nominative case use of pronouns in the attribute 
construction, special exercises should be supplied. 
Usage of Active and Passive Voices.—A record was kept of 
the frequencies of the passive voice.1_ The active voice was 
then computed for each item of material, by using the totals 
found for tenses of finite and non-modal verbs and verb- 
phrases, as a basis from which the number of passives was 
subtracted. 
Aotive 87.2% 
  Dracram XV.—Showing proportion of active and of passive voices used in all 
material and in adult writings. 
On this calculation, 12.8 per cent of all verbs were found 
in the passive voice, and 87.2 per cent in the active voice. 
In the adult material, the proportion of passives is exactly 
the same. The proportions are shown in Diagram XV. 
Adult Usage of Active and Passive Voice——We find a wide 
range of variation in the matter of voice. In some writings 
we find every fourth or fifth verb in the passive voice; at the 
other extreme only one of every 25 verbs is in the passive. 
Newspaper material, whether in straight news matter or 
in the work of special writers, as well as the narratives of 
Macaulay and of Wright, make the largest use of the passive. 
Conversational material in fiction and the women’s letters 
make least use of this voice. The details are shown in Table 
61.

          School Usage of Active and Passive Voices.—Table 62, which 
shows the passive voice in relation to the active voice in school 
compositions, indicates the need of language exercises to 
develop a freer use of the passive. There is a marked 
deficiency in most of the grade material when compared with 
the adult average. Much of the high-school material shows 
a slight excess over the adult standard. But the fact that 
the university compositions again show quite a deficiency, 
indicates that subject matter must play some part. 
The decided and regular increase in the use of the active 
voice must be interpreted in view of the fact that this voice 
constitutes at least 80 per cent of all verbs, and that the 
apparent development shown in Table 62 is, therefore, largely 
the result of increasing freedom in the use of verbs.!

Mood in Verbs.—Little need be said in regard to the subject 
of mood. The subjunctive and imperative occur so infre- 
quently that the whole matter of variation in adult material 
and of development in school writing is shown by a single 
table for each dealing with the indicative mood.! Of all 
finite verbs only .7 of one per cent are subjunctives, and 1.3 
per cent imperative. 
Judging on the basis of frequency of usage alone, there is 
perhaps too much emphasis placed on the matter of subjunc-

tives. It may fairly be questioned whether the distinction, 
which calls for the subjunctive in a few constructions, is not 
too subtle for the grade pupil or even the high-school pupil 
to comprehend. Persistent disregard for the niceties of form 
in adult usage may never justify a sanction of the less exact

    _ form. But it may be doubted whether the learning of com- 
plete paradigms for the subjunctive is the best method of 
developing a sense of the correct form in such a construction 
as a “condition contrary to fact.” 
In reading Tables 63 and 64 we must keep in mind the fact 
that the indicative mood represents 98 per cent of all verbs. 
The extremes in adult usage of the indicative (see Table 63), 
therefore, are practically determined by the respective ratios 
of all verbs per sentence. And what appears to be a striking 
development in school compositions in the increase of indica- 
tives is really only an indication of the regular and decided 
development in the use of verb forms throughout the school 
period. Table 64, which represents the trend in school
-P-A-G-E-126

material for the indicative mood, should be compared with 
Diagram XIV, page 122, which shows the developmental 
trend for the total of finite verbs and verb phrases used. 
In school compositions we find a quite regular development 
in the use of verbs to about the adult average by the close 
of the high-school period, and some excess over this standard

in the university students’ writings. (See Table 64.) Mood 
usage is almost entirely confined to the indicative. Practi- 
cally no use is made of the subjunctive and very little of the 
imperative, and none below the eighth grade. It must be 
noted that this means the chance for a subjunctive, whether 
the proper form was used or not, is very slight in school 
composition. The apparent developmental trend in the use 
of the indicative shown in Table 64 must again be considered 
in connection with the development in the use of all verbs. 
Tense of Verbs and Verb Phrases.—In the analysis a record 
was kept of eight tense forms. Six of these,—present, past,   
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
Verb Forms 129 
future, present perfect, past perfect, and future perfect,'— 
are commonly used in most grammars as the basis of paradigms 
and in the discussion of the meaning of tense. A few 
grammars add the past future and past future perfect forms, 
and a separate record was therefore made of these. 
In all the material examined these tenses occurred in the 
proportions shown in Table 65.

  Adult Usage of Tenses—Without exception, all adult 
material uses the present and past tenses for from 85 to 90 per 
cent of all verbs. The average (See Table 65) is about 88 per 
cent for these two tenses combined, and the fluctuation of the 
total is but slight either way. 
But the range within the present tense is all the way from 28 
to 80 per cent of the total, and in the past tense from 11 to 60

per cent, with every ten percentile represented in several 
types of writing for both present and past tenses. This is, 
of course, the best indication that, so far as these two frequently 
used tenses are concerned, the usage is almost wholly deter- 
mined by the nature of the subject-matter. Narrative prefers 
the past tense, to the present, in the ratio of three to one; in 
correspondence we find the present six to seven times to one 
of the past; expository writing uses the present about three 
times as frequently as the past tense. 
The details of adult usage of these two important tenses are 
shown in conspectus in Table 66.

  The accidents of subject-matter so evidently determine the 
extremes in adult usage that there is nothing to be gained from 
a presentation of the facts in detailed tables for the several 
tenses. With the establishment of the adult standards we 
shall be in a position to make a more detailed analysis of the 
variations in the writing of school children. 
Variations in Tense Usage in School Compositions.—Tables 
67 and 68 show the variations in school usage in the more com- 
mon tenses. In general we might expect the two most 
common tenses, present and past, to follow the same general 
line of development shown for verbs, i.e. a steady increase 
throughout the grades and early high-school period. But
-P-A-G-E-130

while this is true to some extent for the present tense, the 
character of subject matter is seen clearly to be the dominant 
element when we note the variations in present and past 
tenses, taken together, in Table 67.

Table 68 seems to show that pupils are unable to use the 
future tense in the grades, but after the use has once been 
mastered early in the high-school period, the variation becomes 
so irregular as to show again that the demands of subject 
matter control the usage. 
So far as we can judge from the limited use of the present 
perfect tense, there appears to be a marked mastery of this 
form at about the beginning of the high-school period. (See. 
Table 18.)

The remaining tenses are so infrequently used in any type of

developmental conclusions. Diagrams or tables for these

        Emphasis in Teaching Tense.—Six or eight distinct forms of 
tense are taught when grammatical study consists in classi- 
fication exercises. But both adult usage and the develop- 
mental trends in school compositions indicate that this type of 
work involves drill on rarely used forms, some of which are 
very infrequently found in pupils’ every-day usage. 
Frequency of usage indicates the necessity of functional 
drill on past tense forms. The present tense being the primi- 
tive form of a given verb, especially of those that are irregular 
in their principal parts, the relative importance in the teach- 
ing of this tense on the basis of frequency may be modified by 
the unlikelihood of error, which fact is confirmed by the studies
-P-A-G-E-132
  134 How Much English Grammar? 
of errors that have been made and that will be referred to in a 
later chapter. On the other hand, the extreme importance of 
the past tense, in view of the studies of errors, is augmented by 
the apparent need for the frequent use of this tense. 
The relative infrequency of the future tense somewhat 
diminishes the emphasis apparently demanded on the basis of 
frequency of errors. The still rarer use of “shall” and “will” 
in modal, or non-future uses, shown in another connection, 
points in the same direction. 
The chance for the incorrect substitution of the past for 
the past perfect tense, a rhetorical subtlety, that even escapes 
some experienced writers, is also found too infrequently to 
demand any considerable emphasis in grammar courses. 
Person and Number of Finite Verbs.—When we come to 
consider the variations in usage of person and number of 
finite verbs,' we note a further argument against memorizing 
exercises in conjugation. The second person, especially 
in the plural, is rarely used compared with the first and third 
persons. The distribution of all finite verbs among the three 
persons, both singular and plural number, is shown in Table 69.

Verb Forms 135 
Usage of Person and Number.—Tables and diagrams were 
made for adult usage and for school compositions for each 
person and number of the finite verbs. The conclusion was 
evident, however, from all the data that variations in the use _ 
of person and number are so largely determined by the nature 
of the subject-matter that the details have been omitted. In 
the adult material, for example, the first person singular was 
in great excess in all conversational and correspondence 
material, while the third person was deficient in comparison 
with the average. In narrative and expository material 
there was a reciprocal excess of the third person and a defi- 
ciency of the first person. Similar, but less decided, trends 
were shown for the first and third persons in the plural. 
Criticism of Grammar Course in View of Usage.—1. The 
whole subject of verbs, because of conjugational complexities, 
warrants extended treatment in the course in grammar. 
2. Some of the forms, introduced or retained for complete- 
ness, may probably be given more summary treatment than is 
customary, if we may apply the criterion of infrequent usage. 
Labored emphasis on the subjunctive seems unwarranted, 
for this constitutes only seven-tenths of 1 per cent of the 
predicates, with about three for every two hundred sentences. 
The few forms most commonly used could be given attention 
without memorization and drill on the whole paradigm of 
the subjunctive mood. 
3. Another matter often overdone is the uses of “shall” 
and ‘‘will,” non-future. Popular usage seems determined to 
over-rule the grammatical niceties here, and, after all, there 
is little occasion for the quarrel. The non-future uses of 
“shall” and “will” occur about once in every two hundred 
and fifty sentences; the future tense uses constitute 4.5 per 
cent of all tense forms. We find a future tense only every 
tenth sentence, and the future perfects are very rare. 
4, Emphasis on the different tense forms should not be 
equally distributed; the present and past forms should receive 
chief attention. 
5. The recitation of the paradigms must have some value 
in fixing the proper combination of pronoun and verb forms.
-P-A-G-E-134
  136 How Much English Grammar? 
But the relative infrequency of some person and number 
forms raises a doubt as to the value of having pupils recite 
the complete paradigms. While the third person singular 
and plural together comprise 81 per cent of all finite verbs, 
the second person singular comprises only 4.8 per cent of the 
total, and the second person plural only four-tenth of 1 per cent. 
A reasonable modification of the complete conjugation type 
of exercise would be the extension of the voice, mood, and tense 
formations with the person and number changes in subjects 
into sentences that would give a true context sense and would 
associate the proper syntactical combinations more naturally 
than is done with the customary conjugation drill. 
6. Studies of errors made in school compositions have shown 
that one of the commonest faults is the use of the wrong form 
of such irregular verbs as “‘sit,” “set,” “lay,” “lie” ete. 
In a previous section! it was shown that all possible irregular 
forms occur about one-half as often as regular verbs. It 
must be admitted, however, that among the irregular verbs 
a few are probably more frequently used than any individual 
regular verb. This could be demonstrated only by extended 
vocabulary studies. But the prominence given a few common 
irregular verbs in the error studies that have been made 
constitutes the only quantitative evidence we have relating 
to the matter. 
The question is, therefore, not whether irregular verbs are 
to be given a prominent place in language work; it is rather 
a matter of method of attack. Shall we try to overcome the 
errors indirectly by having pupils memorize the principal 
parts of the whole list of irregular verbs, or shall we employ 
the method of drill on the few forms and contexts for the 
particular irregular verbs known to be frequently used errone- 
ously? Is it not a problem of training the ear to the correct 
usage by having the right form heard in school exercises 
more often than the wrong form is heard in out-of-school 
associations?

CHAPTER VIII 
THE EMPHASIS IN THE USE OF ADJECTIVES AND 
ADVERBS 
The Use of Adjectives.—Adjectives constitute 20.9 per cent 
of all words and are next to nouns in importance from the 
point of view of frequency. (See Table 28.) Adjectives 
exceed verbs by a slight margin, the relative proportion of 
the latter in all words being 20.1 per cent. The figure given 
for the adjectives includes the articles, however, and this 
group alone constitutes 44.5 per cent of all the adjectives. 
Classes of Adjectives—The relative proportion of the various 
classes of adjectives! in all material is shown in Table 70.

Adult Usage of Adjectives—We have already noted,—in 
Chapter V, Table 28—the adult extremes in the use of adjectives 
in relation to the total number of words. 
The ratios of adjectives per sentence in various types of 
adult writing are shown in Table 71. Stevenson uses fully 
50 per cent more adjectives than most other writers; the 
newspaper material is near the average; and in conversational 
writing the number of adjectives used is about one-half the 
average. 
However, since this general use of all adjectives includes 
such a large proportion of articles, we shall get a clearer idea 
of usage and development if we analyze each of the classes in 
turn.

The different classes of adjectives are presented in two 
tables. 
Table 72 presents the ratios per sentence of the more 
important classes—the articles and the common and proper 
adjectives—for some of the greatest extremes, both in excess 
and in deficiency, in comparison with adult averages. Table 
73 presents the same facts for the pronominal adjectives, the 
cardinal and ordinal numerals, and adjectives used as nouns.

Adult Usage of Articles—The extremes in adult usage of 
articles are striking. There are 18,045 articles, nearly two to 
every sentence. The range is wide. The extremes are found  
-P-A-G-E-138
  
140 How Much English Grammar? 
in the same book; in the purely narrative portions of Wright’s 
novel fully four times as many articles are used as in the con- 
yersational sections. This contrast between narrative and 
conversational matter is emphasized by some of the other 
extreme items also. 
Adult Usage of Common and Proper Adjectives—From an 
examination of Table 72 it is again apparent that the adjec- 
tive is least used in conversational material. Of all the 
classes of adjectives, we usually think of the common adjec- 
tives as most affected by the personality of the writer and as 
one of the most important of all grammatical elements in 
regard to stylistic value. We are not surprised to find 
Macaulay, with his strain of oratorical floridness, near the top 
of the excess column in Table 72. We also expect Stevenson’s 
finish and color to put him near the top. In the case of the 
other two writers showing an excess over the adult average 
in the use of common adjectives (Wright in the narrative 
sections, and R. H. Little’s dramatic reviews) their work is 
easily recognized as being of a type striving for effect by 
“fine” writing. Business correspondence and most newspaper 
material avoid the use of the adjective. Straight news also 
is sparing in the use of the adjective, as is the editorial work 
of writers like Hard and Brisbane, both of whom achieve much 
of their stylistic effect by simplicity and staccato directness 
in sentence and paragraph structure. 
In the matter of the use of proper adjectives it is quite 
apparent that subject matter has an important influence. 
(See Table 72.) 
Other Classes of Adjectives in Adult Usage——Table 73 
presents the extremes of adult usage of the pronominal 
adjectives and cardinal numerals. With the exception of 
the striking excess in the use of such adjectives by Stevenson, 
nearly double the adult average, and the fact that conversa- 
tional material is at the deficiency extreme, Table 73 presents 
no occasion for comment. 
We would expect an excess of cardinal numerals in the 
newspaper material and business correspondence. (See Table 
73.)
-P-A-G-E-139
  Adjectives and Adverbs 141 
The ordinal numeral is found too infrequently, even in 
material excessive over the average, to indicate any clear 
tendencies even in relation to subject-matter. A record of 
adjectives used as nouns was kept merely to make the classifi- 
cation of all parts of speech complete, and with a view to 
showing whether the topic is of sufficient importance to war- 
rant the attention given to it in some texts. Both of these 
classes involve no grammatical difficulties and occur so infre- 
quently that we find but little reason for assigning them a 
place in the school course as topics needing emphasis. Tables 
and diagrams for these were therefore omitted.

        School Usage of Adjectives——-We have already noted in 
Chapter V the trend in school material as to the proportionate 
number of adjectives in the total number of words. It was
-P-A-G-E-140

shown that adjectives generally stand next to nouns in impor- 
tance from the point of view of frequency. The ratios of 
adjectives per sentence at different school levels are shown in

        1 Compare Table 30, page 75. The apparent slight discrepancy between the 
tables is due to the fact that not every word could be classed as a “‘part of 
speech,” e.g. the expletive there and the sign of the infinitive to. 
While most of the school compositions at different levels 
employ just about as many adjectives as the average adult 
in proportion to the total number of words used, there is a” 
marked deficiency of adjectives in nearly all school writing 
when the comparison is made on the basis of ratios of adjec- 
tives per sentence. The adult average is reached near the 
close of the high-school period, and the variations for the more 
advanced material indicate that subject matter may play a 
small part. The regular development in the grades and high 
school is marked, however. (See Table 74.)

the articles and the common and proper adjectives. Table 
76 presents the same facts for the pronominal adjectives 
and the cardinal numerals. 
In Table 75 we see the variations in the use of articles in 
school compositions. There is a development in their use 
from a decided deficiency in the grades to about the adult 
average after the second year of the high school. The varia-  
-P-A-G-E-142

tions are sufficiently irregular, however, to show that subject 
matter plays a considerable part. 
Deficiencies in Common and Proper Adjectives——The 
development in the use of common adjectives is quite regular 
and gradual. (See Table 75.) The material is all below the 
adult average except that from the University upper classes.

phase of language mastery, was shown in connection with 
their use by adults. There is, therefore, an evident need of 
constructive exercises to stimulate an earlier and easier control 
over common adjectives. Both vocabulary studies and 
sentence completion exercises, with possibly condensation of 
phrase and clause modifiers into single adjectives, are suggested 
as methods of overcoming the deficiency.
-P-A-G-E-143
Adjectives and Adverbs 145 
In adult writings it was found that the use of proper adjec- 
tives was strongly influenced by subject-matter. This is 
again apparent in the irregular variations in their use in school 
writings. (See Table 75.) But the persistent deficiency must 
have some significance. The avoidance of this class because 
of the capitalization difficulty is possible, but hardly probable, 
as the most reasonable substitution, a prepositional phrase, 
would still involve a proper noun. It is more likely that the 
substitution is resorted to because of spelling difficulties often 
involved in transforming a proper noun into a proper adjec- 
tive; or the lack of practice in changing proper nouns to adjec- 
tives may be responsible. 
Teaching Pronominal Adjectives—The use of pronominal 
adjectives in school compositions is open to two widely 
variant explanations. There is a decided deficiency along 
this line in grade pupils’ writings. Above the eighth grade 
there are two marked excesses, with all the rest of the material 
at about the adult average. (See Table 76.) This may 
mean merely that subject-matter is the dominant factor and 
possibly the only one. Or it may mean that the mastery of 
these forms is a valuable phase of language control. A careful 
consideration of the precision and variety as well as the brevity 
made possible by a use of pronominal adjectives would incline 
one to the latter explanation. 
The striking excess over the adult average found in Steven- 
son and the examination of a few of his sentences with these 
facts in mind will emphasize the significance of this explana- 
tion. (See Table 73.) 
For teaching purposes it is probably advisable to take 
this point of view and to urge that exercises should be given 
in the upper grades to stimulate the use of pronominal adjec- 
tives or ‘‘adjective pronouns,” as many of the grammarians 
prefer to call them. 
School Use of Numerals—The erratic variations in school 
compositions in the use of cardinal numerals bears out the 
conclusions drawn from adult usage. The use is probably 
wholly determined by subject-matter. Mastery of numbers 
early in the grades is sufficiently complete to lead us to expect
-P-A-G-E-144
  146 How Much English Grammar? 
no developmental trend in their use in expression. The 
ordinal numeral usage is too infrequent to show any trends. 
The fact that most of the school material equals or exceeds 
the adult average would indicate quite clearly that subject- 
matter is the important factor here also. 
With two striking exceptions, the use of adjectives as 
nouns is on the deficiency side of the adult average. Since 
this usage, at its freest, is inconsiderable, the irregular varia- 
tions are not worth analyzing, but we may say that the 
probability is that subject-matter is a prominent factor in 
determining frequency of use. The tables for the last two 
classes were, therefore, omitted. 
Comparison of Adjectives.—A more important topic in the 
grammar of adjectives is comparison, especially of the irregu- 
lars.! This topic has always been given considerable emphasis 
in the text-books, and its importance has not been minimized 
by the studies that have been made of common errors of 
expression. 
The distinction between the two modes of comparison for 
regular adjectives was not considered of sufficient importance 
to warrant keeping a separate record. Neither was a record 
kept of the frequencies with which the three degrees of regular 
adjectives occurred. But such a record was kept for the 
irregular adjectives. Indeclinable common adjectives were 
included in the count of regular adjectives. 
Of all common adjectives 87.5 per cent are regular, and 
12.5 per cent irregular. In adult material the proportion of 
1TIlustrations of regular and irregular adjectives in different degrees 
of comparison 
(a) Regular Positive-—He saw the cold and sullen stare of defiance rise. 
(b) Regular Comparative-—He knew the soul was colder and more 
sullen than the eye could show. 
(c) Regular Superlative-—It was the coldest and most sullen soul of all 
his foes. 
(d) Irregular Positive—It was bad to go, but worse to stay. 
(e) Irregular Comparative—It was bad to go, but worse to stay. 
(f) Irregular Superlative-—To show hesitation would be worst of all. 
(g) Indeclinable Adjectives—His only route was past the octagonal 
house.
-P-A-G-E-145
Adjectives and Adverbs 147 
regular adjectives is slightly larger, 88.6 per cent. In adult 
writing regular adjectives occur in a ratio of 1.32 per sentence 
and the irregular .17 per sentence. In connection with this 
comparison we must consider, however, that there are only a 
very few irregular adjectives in our English vocabulary. 
Also, since these few irregulars are in such common use, general 
development in language ability will result in a gradual 
increase in the use of regular adjectives. 
* Adult Use of the Irregular Adjectives——A further analysis 
of the adult usage of the irregular adjectives is shown in Table 
77. Perhaps the most important fact is the proportions in 
Taste 77.—Usz or THE DrGREES OF COMPARISON OF IRREGULAR

  which the three degrees are used. In all the material there 
were 1,712 irregular adjectives. Of these 50.8 per cent were 
in the positive degree; 26.5 per cent in the comparative; 
and 22.7 per cent in the superlative. In adult material, 
48.5 per cent of the irregular forms were positive, 28.2 per 
cent comparative, and 23.3 per cent superlative. 
When we take these facts into consideration along with 
the proportion of irregular adjectives in the total number of 
adjectives used, it appears that fully 6 per cent of all adjec- 
tives used are the troublesome irregular comparatives and 
superlatives. 
School Use of Regular and Irregular Adjectives—Not until 
after the freshman year of the university do we find the 
adult average use of regular adjectives equalled. In the 
compositions of the university upper-class students we find 
this average slightly exceeded. (See Table 78.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  148 How Much English Grammar? 
The use of irregular adjectives seems largely dependent on 
the demands of subject matter. (See Table 78.) The varia- 
tions in comparison with the adult average are erratic. But 
in only two of the groups is the adult average exceeded, the

high-school freshmen and the university freshmen. This 
bears out the facts we noted in connection with adult usage. 
The few irregular adjectives are all words in common use and 
come into the child’s vocabulary early. 
We get a slightly different view of the matter in the second 
and fourth columns of the table. There the proportion of 
regular and irregular adjectives used at each school level is 
shown in relation to the combined usage in ratios of adjectives
-P-A-G-E-147
Adjectives and Adverbs 149 
per sentence. It is significant that in only two of the groups 
does the proportion of irregulars used fall below the proportion 
in the adult average. 
The inference for teaching is plain. There are two general 
problems for the language course. We must have one line 
of work to increase the adjective vocabulary and another, 
probably in the nature of drill exercises, to overcome tendencies 
to error in connection with the small group of irregular 
adjectives. 
Degrees of Irregular Adjectives in School Writings—Table 
79 shows the use in school compositions of the three degrees 
of the irregular adjectives. We may recall, in this connection, 
that in adult usage over six per cent of all adjectives used were 
the troublesome irregulars in the comparative and superlative 
degrees. 
With the exception of two groups, the fourth grade pupils 
and the high-school juniors, the use of irregular adjectives 
in the positive degree exceeded adult usage. But with the

exception of the university material, there are so few cases 
involved that no reliable conclusions can be drawn. This 
was further shown by the erratic variations in the different 
percentage columns made out, but which need not be repro- 
duced here. If any generalization is warranted, it is that there 
may be a tendency to avoid the difficulties involved in the use 
of the irregular comparatives and superlatives. 
The school use of the positive degree was 57.7 per cent of 
all irregulars as against 48.5 per cent in adult practice; for the 
comparative degree the school usage was 22.3 per cent, while
-P-A-G-E-148
  150 How Much English Grammar? 
adult usage was 28.2 per cent; the percentage of superlatives 
in school writing was 20.0, in adult usage, 23.3. The facts 
for school usage are shown in Table 79. This may be com- 
pared with the adult usage shown in Table 77. 
Because there are relatively so few irregular adjectives 
involved, the trends shown for each degree of comparison 
have too little value to warrant their reproduction. In general 
it may be said that in the control of both the comparative 
and superlative degrees the trends move very gradually to 
the adult standard, which is reached at about the close of 
the high-school period. 
Teaching the Classes of Adjectives—We may now summarize 
and extend some of the implications that were made by the 
way in regard to the teaching of adjectives. 
The most obvious conclusion is that derived from our 
study of the classification of adjectives. In the older text- 
books, exercises in classification of articles, common and 
proper adjectives, pronominal adjectives (treated as adjective 
pronouns in some texts), and the cardinal and ordinal numerals 
were given a prominent place. This is probably one of the 
best illustrations of a tendency to systematize our grammar 
on classical models. The identification of none of these 
classes, except proper adjectives, serves any practical purpose. 
Inflectional difficulties are nowhere involved. Some of the 
classes are of infrequent occurrence, and the abandonment 
of the classification exercises in the more recent language 
texts is warranted. 
The distinction between the definite and indefinite articles, 
and especially the alternative forms of the latter before vowel 
or consonant, need some attention. 
A more important matter is the need for exercises to develop 
a freer use of common, proper, and pronominal adjectives. 
The extent of the deficiencies, the slow development in mastery 
of these forms, and their value as indicated by the data from 
the standard prose analyzed, have been shown in detail in 
connection with the discussion of each of these classes.1 
1See pages 144, and 145.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
Adjectives and Adverbs 151 
The implications as to method of teaching were also pointed 
out. The exercises in vocabulary and sentence completion 
are urged as a substitution for mere barren classification or 
parsing drill. 
Teaching the Comparison of Adjectives——The teaching of 
adjectives so far as comparison is concerned involves the 
following distinct problems: 
1. Some spelling difficulties in adding the regular suffixes 
for comparatives and superlatives. 
2. Selection as to the proper form for comparison of some 
adjectives,—whether the suffixes or the adverbs “more” 
and “most” should be used. 
3. The fault of using double comparatives. 
4, The mastery of the comparative and superlative forms 
of the irregular adjectives. 
The first of these problems lies outside the field of this 
study. 
There is no adequate basis for a reasonable attack on the 
second problem. More intensive studies of error will have to 
be made in order to reveal the adjectives that give difficulty 
along this line; but it is probable that the list of such adjectives 
is too small to warrant the laborious investigation that would 
need to be made. But until it is made, exercises for practice 
cannot be neglected. Perhaps the niceties of usage will have 
to be acquired by incidental contacts with good models, 
especially in reading. 
Double comparisons are too infrequent to demand much 
emphasis in a language course. The general principle involved 
can easily be understood, and the “barbarism” is too patent 
to be persistent. 
Teaching Irregular Comparatives and Superlatives—The 
ten or twelve irregular adjectives, whose comparison is usually 
memorized in connection with grammar lessons, involve the 
use of a few common comparatives and superlatives which are 
responsible for a fairly important group of errors. 
This is probably another type of error that could be more 
successfully combated by training the ear to proper contextual 
relations than by the mere memorizing of a table of compari-  
-P-A-G-E-150
  
152s How Much English Grammar? 
sons. Drill exercises involving the proper contexts for com- 
paratives and superlatives, like “worse” and “worst,” 
“better” and “best,” “more” and “most,” “less” and 
“least,’”’ will prove most effective in developing an under- 
standing of the practical value of these forms, and will give 
a feeling for the proper word to use. 
The Use of Adverbs.—Adverbs constitute one of the more 
important groups of words from the point of view of frequency, 
but their use involves so little modification in form to meet 
the needs of syntax that they do not require to be emphasized 
in the school course. However, it may be of some value 
to compare their treatment in grammar text books with our 
criteria of use and need. 
In the 10,000 sentences examined there were 13,263 adverbs, 
a ratio of 1.33 per sentence. Of these, 11,826, practically 
89 per cent, were common adverbs, as distinguished from 
conjunctive adverbs,! of which there were 1,437. 
On the basis of the estimated total number of words, we 
found? that 6.6 per cent of all words were adverbs, this part of 
speech ranking sixth in the list of eight on the basis of fre- 
quency of use. 
There are only three topics we need to take up in connection 
with adverbs: (1) the frequency of common adverbs in adult 
and school usage; (2) the use of conjunctive adverbs; and 
(3) the problems involved in the comparison of irregular 
adverbs. 
Examining Table 80 we find both Stevenson and Macaulay 
on the excess side of the average. On the other hand, the 
greatest deficiency appears in the practical material, the 
Associated Press dispatches and the Business Letters. Con- 
versational material is also on the deficiency side of the 
average. Table 80 gives the data for all adverbs. 
The analysis of values should rather be based on the rela- 
tive uses of common and conjunctive adverbs considered 
separately. This is shown in Table 81.

    In Table 81 we see the extreme variations in different adult 
writings in the use of common and conjunctive adverbs in 
terms of ratio per sentence. The average adult usage of 
common adverbs is 1.24 per sentence. There is quite a wide 
range in individual usage, with excess in the more literary 
material and women’s letters, and a deficiency in the more 
practical every-day writings. Stevenson uses nearly twice 
the adult average, while in business letters there is about 
one-half the average number of adverbs. 
In the matter of conjunctive adverbs, the adult average 
usage is fifteen to one-hundred sentences. Stevenson and the 
women’s letters use about 50 per cent in excess of this number, 
while in several of the writers we find only from one-half to one- 
third of the average usage. (See Table 81.)

Adult Use of Irregular Adverbs.—Since the positive form of 
irregular adverbs gives no occasion for error, no inflectional 
form being involved, no separate record was kept of the irreg- 
ular adverbs except in the comparative and superlative 
degrees.!_ These inflected forms are used very infrequently. 
In adult material the average frequency for the comparative 
degree was about three to one-hundred sentences. A few 
extreme variations were found on the excess side. Stevenson 
uses about eight in every hundred sentences, and in the 
Herald editorials five are found to each hundred sentences.

(b) Irregular Superlative-—He was the best prepared, but did it worst 
of all the school.

In the superlative degree, the adult average shows two to 
every hundred sentences, and we find only a slight excess — 
over this average in the writings of a few men. Stevenson 
again exceeds the average adult usage, with four to one- 
hundred sentences; and Macaulay and Hard each use three 
irregular superlatives in one-hundred sentences. 
The usage may be seen readily by a glance at Table 82.

    Common and Conjunctive Adverbs in School Compositions.— 
In Chapter V, Table 30, the trend in school compositions as 
to the proportionate number of adverbs in the total number 
of words was referred to. 
We do not find the adult average attained in the use of 
common adverbs in any of the grades or high-school years, 
but university students exceed the average. The variations 
are irregular, however, with the lowest ratio a little over one- 
half the adult average. (See Table 83.) 
School usage of conjunctive adverbs shows greater extreme 
variations. (See Table 83.) The average usage is equalled 
or exceeded even in some of the grade compositions, and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-154
  
156 How Much English Grammar? 
whole range of school writings shows that the use of the con- 
junctive adverb is probably determined more by the nature 
of the subject matter than by the school level reached by the 
writer.

Irregular Adverbs in School Compositions—Tables are 
unnecessary to present the simple facts about the use in 
school writings of the comparative and superlative degrees 
of irregular adverbs. A separate record of these forms was 
not kept for the university upper-class or the eighth grade 
material. In all the rest of the school material, only thirty- 
three irregular adverbs were found in the comparative and 
forty-three in the superlative degree. The use of such forms, 
which often results in errors in composition, is very rare in
-P-A-G-E-155
  Adjectives and Adverbs 157 
high-school and grade work. Over one-half of the above 
total—twenty cases—in the comparatives, and about one- 
third of the total—fifteen cases—in the superlatives, were 
in university freshman compositions. We have already noted 
the infrequency of these irregular forms in the adult material. 
Of all common adverbs 2.5 per cent were irregular compara- 
tives, and 1.8 per cent irregular superlatives. 
The Teaching of Adverbs—Infrequent usage and the fact 
that few inflectional difficulties are involved in the use of 
adverbs make this part of speech one of the least important 
in the language course. 
The only evidence we have from the analysis of usage that 
offers a constructive suggestion is the need of some work to 
stimulate an easier use of adverbs in school writings. The 
deficiency in comparison with adult standards was shown to 
be striking. The excess over the adult average in the best 
standard prose analyzed suggests the value of increasing the 
pupils’ control over the use of adverbs. 
The irregular adverbs are found too infrequently to demand 
much attention. The frequencies found were very largely 
connected with the use of ‘‘more,” “most,” and ‘“‘less,’”’ as 
modifiers of adjectives or other adverbs. Their use involves 
little chance for error. 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-156
CHAPTER IX 
THE FREQUENCY OF MINOR PARTS OF SPEECH 
The Use of Prepositions.—There are three minor parts of 
speech that have not been taken up separately,—prepositions 
conjunctions, and interjections. 
The first of these has been discussed to some extent in 
Chapter IV in connection with prepositional phrases. 
Because the record was kept of these phrases, and because 
practically all of the problems connected with this part of 
speech are involved in the phrase construction, the prepositions 
as such require little additional discussion. The frequencies 
of prepositions, their proportion in the total number of words 
and ratios per sentence, in both adult and school usage, were 
dealt with in the above connection. 
Use of Wrong Prepositions——One matter concerning the 
teaching of prepositions remains to be noticed here. 
Whatever chance for error there is in connection with the 
prepositional phrases lies, not in difficulties of construction, 
but in diction faults in the use of wrong or superfluous preposi- 
tions. The total number of prepositional phrases, or their 
ratio per sentence, has no direct bearing on this matter, 
since only a few of the many prepositions that can be used 
are commonly subject to incorrect use. Further investigation 
in the matter of usage of prepositions would seem to lie in 
the direction of tabulating the frequencies of those prepositions 
often used incorrectly. That such a study in diction habits 
would be worth while is shown by the fact that even in the 
university upper-class compositions we find the use of the 
wrong preposition to be one of the most persistent errors. 
The Infrequent Use of Interjections.—Interjections may 
also be disposed of very briefly. 
- 158 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  Minor Parts of Speech 159 
We have already noted, in Chapter V, the infrequent use 
of interjections in relation to the total number of words in 
adult writings. In the same connection the trend in school 
material as to the proportionate number of interjections in 
the total number of words was presented. 
The conclusion is evident, that this part of speech occurs 
so seldom that it would get no notice in language work if it 
were not for a special requirement in punctuation. But 
even the use of the exclamation point is often optional. 
The fact that occasion for this rule does not arise before 
the high-school years should properly relegate its discussion 
to the later rhetoric-and composition courses. 
Use of Conjunctions.—In Chapter V, pp. 72 and 73, 
data were presented showing the adult extremes in the use 
of conjunctions in relation to the total number of words. In 
the same connection, pp. 75 and 76, the trend in school 
material as to the proportionate number of conjunctions in 
the total number of words was presented. 
We may now glance at the distribution of the use of con- 
junctions in adult writings among the three classes. Refer- 
ence to Table 84 will show that fully three-fourths of the 
conjunctions are co-ordinate, about one-fifth subordinate, and 
about one-twentieth correlative.!

Adult usage of conjunctions shows a wide range at the 
extremes. (See Table 85.) Stevenson uses twice as many as 
1 Illustrations of classes of conjunctions. 
(a) Co-ordinate-—John and Charles walked, but the rest rode. 
(b) Subordinate—They got out when they arrived. 
(c) Correlative.—Kither he is sick, or he has met with some accident.

  160 How Much English Grammar? 
the adult average. His masterly use of the compound and 
complex-compound sentence has already been referred to in 
Chapter II. At the other extreme, we find the fiction writers 
and Brisbane using about two-thirds of the adult average.

Classes of Conjunctions in Adult Usage.—The variations 
in adult use of the three classes of conjunctions are shown in 
Table 86. Stevenson’s use of double the adult average holds 
true for both the co-ordinate and the subordinate groups, 
but in the use of correlatives he is exceeded by the balanced 
style of Macaulay, who ranks second in the other two classes, 
but in these he is considerably below Stevenson. The con- 
versational passages in Wright and Oppenheim are approxi- 
mately at one-half the adult average in the use of co-ordinate 
conjunctions but quite near the average in the use of 
subordinates. 
Aside from the extremes—Macaulay, Stevenson, and the 
business letters on the excess side, and Brisbane and Hard 
on the deficiency side—there is probably little significance 
to be attached to the facts présented in Table 86, as far as adult 
use of correlatives is concerned.

Deficiency of Conjunctions in School Writings.—Perhaps 
the most significant fact in connection with the matter of 
conjunctions is the consistent deficiency in the school com- 
positions. This is not in accord with the common observa- 
tion of the “and” fault in the speech of children, and the 
common violation of sentence unity by combining two or 
more complete sentences into one. But it must be borne in 
mind that the number of co-ordinate conjunctions also includes 
the connectives between co-ordinate members within clauses, 
such as compound subjects, predicates, and modifiers. It is 
more likely that the deficiency in conjunctions in school 
writings lies here. The question involves values that would 
warrant a more detailed analysis along these lines, both of 
adult practice and school usage. 
The facts about school usage are shown in Tables 87 and 
88. In Table 87 it appears that, so far as all conjunctions
-P-A-G-E-160
  
ey 
162 How Much English Grammar? 
are concerned, only the university students come near attain- 
ing the adult average usage. With the exception of the 
extreme deficiency in the sixth-grade material, we may say 
that, in general, grade pupils use about two-thirds the adult 
average number of conjunctions, and high-school pupils about 
four-fifths.

In the matter of co-ordinate conjunctions there is evidence 
of a rather regular development, although the freest use of 
this part of speech on the part of any school group is still 
considerably on the deficiency side. (See Table 88.) 
The variations from the adult average are quite erratic 
in the matter of subordinate conjunctions, and several of the 
groups above the grades exceed the adult average. (See 
Table 88.) 
As it stands, Table 88 shows quite a regular development 
in the use of correlative conjunctions. But there are too
-P-A-G-E-161

few cases involved in any of the school groups to make this

              The Teaching of Conjunctions.—We find striking evidence 
of the value of a real mastery of conjunctions. This is true 
for all three classes,—co-ordinate, subordinate, and correlative. 
Our basis for this is the usage in the best prose that was 
analyzed. 
We also find striking evidence of a deficiency in the use of 
conjunctions‘ in school writings, notably in the matter of 
co-ordinate conjunctions. 
On the basis of our common observation and experience, 
it will probably be necessary to continue correcting the ‘‘and”’ 
error in oral composition work, and the faults in sentence 
unity due to compounding sentences.

But on the constructive side, it must be admitted that the 
evidence calls for a freer control of conjunctions, even the 
co-ordinates. If we recognize the common faults mentioned 
above in regard to certain excessive uses, it appears all the 
more important to develop control of such conjunctions in 
connection with parallel subject, predicate, object, and 
modifier elements within clauses. Special exercises for the 
mastery of such series will at the same time furnish oppor- 
tunity for overcoming the error in the use of the comma in 
a series, which is one of the most common mistakes in 
punctuation.

CHAPTER X 
THE RELATION BETWEEN USE AND ERROR IN 
LANGUAGE COURSES 
Supplementary Error Studies Made.—While the chief 
purpose of the present study has been to establish the relative 
importance of the various topics in grammar on the basis of 
usage, such a study would not-be complete without comparing 
“the results ‘reached with the results of studies of errors in 
grammatical usage. With this end in view, somesupplemen- 
tary studies have been made, as follows:— 
1. All the school compositions that were analyzed for 
frequencies of use, except those of the fourth grade, were 
examined also for errors, so that we have a study of errors in 
a body of material ranging from that of university upper-class 
and freshmen students, through the four years of high school, 
and the three upper grades of the elementary school. 
2. Because of the wide range of this material it will be 
possible to present comparisons showing variations or persis- 
tency in the various types of error for a wider field of school 
work than has been shown in any single previous study of 
errors. 
3. Comparisons were made with some of these earlier error 
studies, and an attempt was made to relate the frequencies of 
error to frequencies of use, by means of “error quotients.” 
Error Studies Compared.—The present study deals with 
288 separate compositions, containing 3,150 sentences, with 
a total of about 58,196 words. 
In order to make the study comparable with that of other 
studies in error and at the same time related to the study of 
usage, the categories of error used in the studies of Charters

and Miller,! Lyman,? and Johnson,’ were followed in the main, 
especially that common to the two last named, with such 
modifications as would adapt them to the material and the 
purposes outlined above. 
Guide List of Errors Used.—On the pages next following 
is given the ‘Guide List of Errors,” (see Table 89) with the 
numerical and literal designations which are used for con- 
venience in presenting the tabulation of errors.

For the sake of convenience in comparison with other studies, 
the device of giving error categories the group numbers 
and the individual numbers used in the Lyman and the 
Johnson studies is followed. In the tables following, the 
categories are given in such a way that all the Roman numerals 
correspond to the same groups of error as in the Lyman and 
the Johnson studies. Similarly, the main divisions of these 
larger groups, designated by Arabic figures, again correspond. 
But the subdivisions of these, designated by letters, do not 
appear in the other studies. Most of these subdivisions were 
introduced for the sake of making possible a more detailed com- 
parison of errors with the chances for error, or the frequencies 
of usage. 
Summary Tabulation of Errors Found.—The original tabula- 
tions showed for each of the school classes and the categories 
of error: (1) the number of errors, (2) the frequencies of use, 
or chances for error, where these could be determined, and 
(3) the error quotients derived by dividing the number of 
errors by the number of chances. 
But of the 74 separate categories it was found possible to 
compute or count the chances for error in only 33 of the items 
in the list. 
Since the tables are too extended and cumbersome to be 
reproduced in their original form, and since the majority of 
the items would be blank in the “chance” and ‘error quo- 
tient”? columns, it will, perhaps, be more feasible to present 
the error tabulations first and then the data about “error 
quotients.” 
The actual number of errors found are shown in Tables 90a 
90b, 90c. The first (90a) shows the errors in the main groups 
I to V, the second (90b) in groups VI to VIII, and the third 
(90c) in groups IX to XIV of the list given in Table 89.

adding the horizontal rows, not the vertical columns.

Totals for Error Groups.—The tabulation of errors has been 
presented so that totals are shown for each of the categories 
at the right of Tables 90a, 90b, 90c. and the totals are also 
shown for each general group, which are again footed up in 
such a way as to show the grand total of errors for each school 
level. 
It may be stated here in a general way, in regard to the 
totals in Tables 90, 90a, 90b, and 90c, that the number of 
errors in the different general categories, when ranked for the 
various school levels that were comparable with the other 
studies of errors correlate from nearly +.7 to nearly +.9.

  material will give quite an accurate index of the relative 
importance of the various errors for any particular group. 
The total results of judging the importance of the various 
types of error by the ranking method is presented in Table 91, 
for each of the school levels and for the totals taken from the 
last column of Table 90. The comparisons of some of these 
rankings with comparable groups in the other studies are 
presented in Table 92, and in connection with this the various 
coefficients of correlation are given. 
1In an elaborate investigation of the errors of the sixth and seventh 
grades of the Kansas City Schools, Charters and Miller collected all the 
material in the form of written exercises handed in by the pupils during 
one month. After the study was completed, however, they stated that 
a single paper of 150 words from each pupil would have been sufficient 
to determine dependable conclusions. (University of Missouri Bulletin, 
Vol. 16, No. 2 Education Series, 9.)
-P-A-G-E-173
Relation between Use and Error 175 
Error Quotients.—The chances for error and, consequently, 
the error quotients could neither be tallied nor derived from 
the tables of frequency in a number of the error categories. 
In a few cases, perhaps, some explanation as to the omission 
in the “chances” column ought to be given. 
Categories 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18a, 18b, 19, 20, 22, 
23a-d, 24, 25, 26a-f, 32h, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42b, 47a, and 47b, 
it is apparent, were not subject to record in the “chance” 
column. (See Table 89 for names of categories.) 
The chances for category 8a, ‘‘Disagreement of Verb and 
Subject,” might have been presented by giving the total 
number of predicates from the “‘frequency of use” tables, but 
evidently this would have been an unreasonable exaggeration 
from a practical point of view. The chances for category 23a, 
“Subject of Sentence Omitted,” might similarly have been 
presented, but this again would seem to be unreasonable. 
The chances for category 5, “Disagreement between Pro- 
noun and Its Antecedent,” and for ‘Failure to Use a Capital 
at the Beginning of a Quotation,” 37b, could have been tallied, © 
but were overlooked in planning the tables at the beginning 
of the work. 
The chances for 45, ‘‘Mispelled Words,” might have been 
entered as the total number of words, but again this appears 
unreasonable. An alternative would have been to go through 
all the material again after the list of errors had been secured, 
and then record the frequency with which these particular 
words occurred either in the work of any given group or in 
the work of the individual who made the error. This would 
have been quite outside the scope of a study in grammar errors 
and usage. 
Comparison with the Johnson and the Lyman Studies.— 
As a result of the limitations in getting “chances” for a 
number of the errors, the results of the investigation are 
not as satisfactory as might have been desired for purposes 
of comparison. 
However, we may approach the matter of comparisons 
with the other studies, first by comparing the results of Table 
91 on the basis of the ranks of the various error groups, with 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  176 How Much English Grammar? 
similar ranks made in the Lyman and the Johnson studies. 
This is done by presenting the totals for each error group and 
for each school level in Table 91, and then by selecting those 
columns of Table 91 for comparison with the totals and ranks 
of similar school levels presented in the other studies. These 
are then shown in Table 92. 
Johnson presents the results on error tabulation of the 
freshmen in four Kansas City high schools, comprising 132 
exercises with 50,371 words, and 66 exercises of freshmen of 
the Kansas City Junior College, comprising 32,693. words. 
Lyman’s study presents an error tabulation for 322 high-school 
freshmen exercises, comprising 59,516 words. Four high 
schools were included, New Trier (at Winnetka, Ill.) Blooming- 
ton, Ill., University of Chicago High, and Vinton, Iowa. The 
material in the present study compared with this is from the 
Freeport, Ill., high school, and from the University of Illinois 
freshmen.

The number of themes and running words involved in the 
material of the Freeport high-school freshmen is so small a 
part of the whole number in the present study that further 
comparisons may have only limited significance. 
However, we may mention some details: 
1. Punctuation ranks first in all schools in the Lyman 
study and in the present study. Spelling ranks highest in 
number of errors in the Kansas City study. There would 
not be much significance in the ranking of the freshmen in 
this study if it were not for the fact that this category of 
error gets first rank by a big margin at every school level, as 
shown by Table 91. The punctuation errors are from two 
to five times as great as the number of spelling mistakes at 
different school levels. The total punctuation errors for all 
the high-school pupils in this study are three times the number 
of mistakes in spelling. In general the same excess is shown 
in the tables of all of the four high schools studied by Lyman. 
Correlations of the Different Studies—Table 92 presents 
these various comparable groups in contiguous columns, with 
the corresponding ranks for each of the main categories of 
error. 
In the high-school freshmen group there are three compa- 
rable columns. The correlations may be of some interest: 
For the high-school freshmen the coefficients of correlation 
follow: 
Johnson’s study and Lyman’s, +.80 
Lyman’s study and the present study, +.88 
Johnson’s study and the present study, +.69 
For the college freshmen we have the correlation between 
Johnson’s study and the present one, +.68 
The totals of the present study and Lyman’s totals have a 
correlation of +.84 
The totals of the present study and Johnson’s high-school 
totals have a correlation of +.69. 
The correlation between the ranks of error groups for the 
grade totals of this study and Charters and Miller’s study 
of errors in grade written material is +.61. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  178 How Much English Grammar? 
Persistency of Errors at Various School Levels——We may 
at this point make a further study of Tables 91 and 92 for the 
purpose of tracing the developmental phase, or what may 
be designated as the relative persistency of various types 
of error at the various schoollevels. Category VIII, “Mistakes 
in Punctuation,” holds first place in the ranking through all 
school levels. Category XII, “Mistakes in Spelling,” holds 
second or third place throughout. Category VII, “Failure to 
Express Clear Meaning,” which is third in the totals, holds 
second or third place at all levels except with the high-school 
sophomores and the seventh grade, and is fourth in rank in 
these. The group ranking fourth in the totals, No. X, 
“Mistakes in Capitalization,” quite consistently holds fourth or 
fifth place throughout, until the University upper-class level 
is reached, when it drops to eleventh place. 
It is a striking fact that among the three leading error 
groups we are not dealing with distinctively grammatical 
elements, although a number of the rules for punctuation, 
the worst group in the matter of error, involves several 
grammatical applications. 
We might trace all of the categories through as we have 
done, but we would find practically the same persistency in 
ranking, with possibly a single exception, category XIV. 
In the number of miscellaneous grammatical and rhetorical 
errors, which constitute a small part of the total, there is a 
general improvement from lower to higher levels 
Ratio of Errors to Number of Words.—Perhaps the matter 
ought to be approached from a different point of view in order 
to reveal the true situation. The material representing 
the different groups varies considerably in bulk, as can be 
seen by the number of themes, sentences, and words given 
at the bottom of the columns in Table 91. It will be proper 
to reduce the total of errors at the foot of these columns to 
the number of errors per sentence and the ratio of errors to 
number of words. This is done in Table 93. 
The ratio of errors to the number of sentences may perhaps 
be represented more clearly by reading the ratios given above 
on the basis of ten sentences, as, University upper classes
-P-A-G-E-177
  
Relation between Use and Error 179 
and freshmen made nine errors in every ten sentences, the 
High-school seniors eleven errors in every ten sentences, and 
so on. While these ratios show no great variation and no 
distinct trend in the overcoming of errors, the second column, 
the ratio of errors to number of words, does show this develop- 
ment very decidedly. The latter, no doubt, is the more 
serviceable representation of facts.

When we take the developmental control of error for the 
different levels of school into consideration with the fact that 
the ranks in the various categories of error are practically 
constant, we reach the conclusion in connection with the whole 
matter of composition errors, that, while there are practically 
twice as many errors at the lower school level as at the upper, 
the fact is explained by improvement from year to year in all 
the various categories, rather than by the elimination of any 
particular types of error. 
Tables 90 and 91 may again be scanned with this principle 
inmind. It is perhaps best to take some of the more common 
errors and read the error-frequencies for the different school 
levels, either from left to right, or from right to left. Cate- 
gory VIII, the one on punctuation, presents the best field  
-P-A-G-E-178
  180 How Much English Grammar? 
for such an examination, and it readily appears that the above 
principle holds true in practically every one of the subdivisions. 
Comparison with Charters’ Studies.—The first important 
study of grammatical errors was made by Dr. W. W. Charters, 
then Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of 
Missouri, and Edith Miller, Teacher of English at the Soldan 
High School, St. Louis. The results of their study were 
first published in ‘‘The University of Missouri Bulletin,” 
Vol. 16, No. 2, under the title ‘‘ A Course of Study in Grammar, 
Based upon the Grammatical Errors of School Children of 
Kansas City, Missouri.” The Bulletin was published in 
January, 1915. 
The reason given for undertaking the study is stated in 
the opening paragraph, as follows: ‘‘Certain criticisms are 
urged persistently against the course of study in grammar in 
the upper grades of the elementary school. The most prom- 
inent of these bases its claims upon the theory that the func- 
tion of grammar in the grades is to serve as an aid to correct 
oral and written expression, and asserts that many of the rules 
of grammar taught are not broken by children and ought not, 
therefore, to be included in the course of study’’ (page 3). 
The purpose of the Charters-Miller investigation was 
“to find (1) what errors in the use of oral and written language 
forms violating rules of grammar, were made by the children 
of the Kansas City elementary schools, (2) what rules in 
grammar were necessary in order to include and understand 
these items, and (3) what items in the present course of study 
in Kansas City were included but unnecessary, and what 
items should be included but were omitted’’ (page 3). 
The authors declare that their ‘‘ purpose is merely to indicate 
how closely the Kansas City course of study corresponds to 
one constructed upon the basis of errors.” The practical 
value of the results was immediately recognized as having 
more than mere local significance, especially when an extension 
of the method of the study of grammatical errors was under- 
taken in a number of other cities, which confirmed the general 
conclusions of the original study, without adding anything 
of significance to the original list of essentials and non-essen-
-P-A-G-E-179
Relation between Use and Error 181 
tials. The authors recognized the need of approaching the 
problem from other points of view and by other methods, for 
they said,—‘‘It is neither claimed nor asserted in this study 
that a course of study in grammar should be based exculsively 
upon errors. Other methods of selection are frequently 
advocated, and the relative validity needs to be investigated 
with care.” 
Comparison of Results.—As a basis for the comparison of 
the results of this study in the errors found in the grade 
material with that of the Charters-Miller investigation, 
two of their summary tables, designated by them as ‘Table 
A” and ‘“‘Table E,” with some explanatory quotations to 
make clear the meaning of the tables are reproduced in the 
following pages. 
“InTableA, . . . theresultsof the tabulations are summed 
up. On the left is a statement of the errors . . . Next, to 
the right, is found the total number of errors reported by all 
the teachers, and on the extreme right is given the percentage 
of errors approximated to the nearest integer and obtained by 
dividing the numbers in the ‘total errors’ column by 6,000 
instead of 5,883,’ 
“The percentage column [Table A] has some interesting 
figures. The largest single item, 24 per cent, is the confusion 
of the past tense and the past participle. This comprises 
one quarter of the errors reported. The next largest 14 per 
cent, is the failure of the verb to agree with its subject in person 
and number. The errors in the use of the verb (errors number 
8 to 13) constitute 57 per cent of the total errors. Mistakes 
in the use of case, particularly in pronouns, (errors number 
1 to 3) comprise 7 per cent of the total. The confusions of 
the adjective forms with each other and with the adverb 
(errors number 14, 15 and 17), total 5 per cent. Double 
negatives occur in 11 per cent of the errors, and syntactical 
redundance (error number 20) includes 10 per cent. When 
to these there is added 3 per cent for the confusion of the 
demonstrative adjective with the personal pronoun, the

due to the failure to have stenographic reports of oral speech. 
For instance, it is obvious that children, in talking, confuse 
dependent and independent clauses, but no such errors were 
reported by the teachers, who, intent upon errors in the use 
of parts of speech and hurried by school duties in jotting down 
the errors, paid little attention to the longer clauses. Errors 
due to faulty sentence structure, unless particularly flagrant, 
are likely to escape the attention until seen in cold print. 
“In Table E, the errors, the numbers on the left, the 
illustrations, and the totals are self-explanatory. The left 
hand percentage list takes into account all errors tabulated 
and shows the errors of punctuation to be the most frequent. 
The right hand list shows the relative percentages of those 
items which are listed under oral errors in Tables A, C, and 
D.”! (Only the first is used here.) 
Comparable Error Groups——With the Charters-Miller 
study we have points of comparison for twenty-two of the 
twenty-seven error categories in their “Table E.” These 
are all practically identical. To facilitate comparison the 
numbered error groups of their study with their respective per- 
centages, the ranks of the total errors, the equivalent cate- 
gories of the present study, and new designations for the groups 
are given in Table 94. These comparable groups are then 
further compared in Table 95. 
The correlation of the ranks with those of the Charters- 
Miller study is high. As has been previously noted, Charters 
and Miller placed a high measure of reliability in a compara- 
tively small body of material. Their opinion may be quoted 
in full in this connection. 
“All the types of error tabulated were found in the first 
school studied; and consequently, when other schools were 
studied, the only change in the tabulation that occurred was 
in the relative percentages of error among the different 
classes. The study of the last half dozen schools did not 
affect the results and served chiefly as a check upon the 
work.

It is unfortunate that the principle of ‘error quotients” 
cannot be applied for all the comparable groups in Table 95.

errors, notably that which ranks first in most of the error 
studies, seems worth noting. The omission of the period at 
the end of a sentence drops to fourth place on this principle. 
The omission of the apostrophe to denote possession shows 
up as an error that is made in 41.5 per cent of the chances, and 
the interrogation mark is omitted in 37.5 per cent of the 
chances. The period error has dropped to 3.7 per cent of 
the chances. There seems to be rather striking evidence on 
this basis that the two former are errors due to incomplete 
training, while the last may be set down as a matter of simple 
carelessness. To remedy the latter difficulty, we would

adopt an entirely different method from that which we would 
employ to overcome errors due to inadequate or wrong 
training. 
The Use of Error Quotients.—At this point it will be proper 
to refer to Table 90 and present in brief the results of the 
attempt to establish “error quotients.” The limitations of 
this method, due to the fact that chances for error could not 
be determined for many of the categories, have already been 
pointed out.1. The data made available where “error quo- 
tients” could be derived may be summarized as a basis for 
showing the need of some method of weighting the actual 
number of errors found. 
Some of the error quotients based on the totals may be 
presented first and then a few illustrations may be shown as 
typical of developmental trends. 
In Group I, Mistakes in the Case of Pronouns, the figures 
are as follows:

1. Subject or object of verb in wrong case. 5 4,480 -001

We may interpret these figures by saying that in school 
compositions pupils will put the subject or object of a verb 
in the wrong case once out of 1,000 chances. They will put 
the object in the wrong case form six times out of 1,000 
chances. The predicate nominative will be put in the wrong 
case twice in 100 chances. The wrong case will be used with 
the gerund four times in every ten chances. Some mistake

The various items may now be rearranged in the order of 
their importance on the basis of the error quotients. In each 
case the figure following the item would be an index of the 
proportionate number of times the error would probably 
be made in school writings in 1,000 chances. 
Similar error quotients might be computed for all of these 
items for each of the various school levels. This should 
probably be attempted as an independent study with a larger 
body of material for each of the grades represented. The 
purpose in working out the above table was to illustrate 
the method of computing error quotients, and to show that 
the relative frequency of any error in a total number is a 
method of weighting open to objections on the basis of empha- 
sis. The practical value would rather lie in having schools or 
teachers compute such tables for their own classes. 
Validity of Error Studies as a Basis for the Grammar Course. 
There are certain considerations which weigh against the 
value of error studies as guides in determining the curriculum 
in grammar. 
1. One who makes such a study is influenced by the personal 
factor in judging whether or not to include certain errors. 
Different tabulators will observe different standards. That 
this is an important factor in some categories may be illus- 
trated. In Category VII, “Failure to Express Clear Meaning,”’ 
the ranks are considerably higher in Dr. Lyman’s and 
in this study than in Johnson’s study. Table 92 shows 
rank 5 and rank 8 for these in the high-school studies as 
compared with rank 12 in Johnson’s study. In the same 
category University of Illinois freshmen rank third and 
Kansas City pupils twelfth. The present study ranks this 
error third, while Dr. Lyman’s gives it a ranking of fifth. 
2. The studies of error, even with large masses of material, 
present only a limited indication as to the relative value of 
the various topics that might be included in a grammar 
course. Such studies may point out some of the important 
items for drill. But the topics usually gleaned from such a 
list include only a small part of the material we must evaluate, 
if we are to make a thorough-going review of the whole
-P-A-G-E-191
  Relation between Use and Error 193 
content of the subject. The Charters-Miller list of oral 
errors mentions twenty-one topics that should be given 
attention, and the list of written errors twenty-seven topics. 
3. The positive value of error studies is not to be minimized, 
but traditional grammar courses in English have labored 
under such a heavy burden of classical adaptations that 
we must know what to eliminate,—what we may safely 
eliminate. Only by a study of frequency of use as well as of, 
frequency of error can we find a basis for a revision of the 
course of study in grammar.

  CHAPTER XI 
PRESENT-DAY SCHOOL PRACTICE AND THE PLAN 
FOR REVISION 
Textbooks the Basis of School Language Courses.—~- 
Keeping in mind the standards we have derived from our 
study of grammatical usage and errors, we may now proceed 
to evaulate the course of study in common use in the schools 
by comparing the relative importance given various topics 
in the grammar text books in general use with the values we 
have established as a result of our studies in use and error. 
The average course of study is mapped out for teachers in 
terms of the number of pages in a designated text to be covered 
in a year or a semester. Few teachers are permitted to 
deviate greatly from such routine assignments. 
Analysis of Ten Leading Textbooks.—In carrying out this 
method of analysis of text books, a selection of ten was made 
from a large list. Most of the texts selected are very widely 
used at the present time. 
The Texts Selected —The texts selected for analysis with the 
date of copyright are listed below. The title pages are repro- 
duced in full in Appendix A, for the identification of the par- 
ticular volume ina series, or the particulareditionexamined. It 
was the aim to select such as were designed for use in the upper 
grades, where grammar is usually given its principal emphasis 
and technical elaboration. 
The texts examined were as follows: 
. Whitney: ‘Essentials of English Grammar” (1877). 
. Baskerville and Sewell: ‘An English Grammar’ (1895). 
- Maxwell: ‘School Grammar” (1907). 
. Blount and Northup: ‘‘An Elementary English Grammar” (1911). 
. Manly and Bailey: ‘Lessons in the Speaking and Writing of 
English,” Book Two (1912).

1917). 
‘ Seipes Jeschke, and Gillet: “Oral and Written English,” Book 
Two (1917), 
10. Driggs: ‘Live Language Lessons,” Third Book (1918). 
Method of Analysis——The comparison of the texts was made 
as nearly as possible in respect to the same topics that were 
investigated in the study of usage, i.e., the N. E. A. termi- 
nology. But it was found that provision had to be made for 
a considerable number of topics treated exclusively in one 
or another of the books, as well as others that were treated in 
several but not in all texts. 
In order to make the record as objective as possible, and 
to reduce the comparison to the finest degree practicable, 
the number of lines devoted to each topic was tallied. A 
number of arbitrary regulations in making the record had to 
be laid down at the outset, as follows: 
1. Size of type was disregarded. This would make some 
difference in the total contents of a book, but little difference 
in the relative amount of space devoted to each topic. 
2. All parts of lines were counted as full lines. 
3. Illustrations used in text or exercises were estimated 
at about their equivalent in lines. 
4. A separate record was kept of “text” and ‘‘exercises.” 
In the former were included all rules, explanations and 
examples; in the latter all sentences for practice in analysis, 
diagraming, parsing, etc., and the directions as to what was 
to be done with them. 
5. Material dealing with two or more topics at the same 
time, usually in a comparative discussion, was divided equally 
between the topics. 
6. Some topics were treated so distinctively in one connec- 
tion, e.g. punctuation with the constructions involved, that 
it was not tabulated under both topics that were involved. 
General Trends in Language Work.—It is impracticable to 
reproduce here the detailed tabulation that was made. In 
   
-P-A-G-E-194
    196 How Much English Grammar? 
dealing with the sentence as a whole and with phrases, there 
was a table involving 29 different topics, with separate columns 
of “‘text”’ and ‘‘exercises’”’ for each of the books. Clauses 
were dealt with under 18 topics; nouns, 17; pronouns, 20; 
case uses, 25; verbs, 49; adjectives, 13; adverbs, 8; preposi- 
tions, 5; conjunctions, 7; and interjections, 1. 
From these detailed tables devoted to the various topics 
that were taken account of in the analysis, it is apparent at 
first glance that there is no consistent principle underlying 
the making of grammar textbooks or the planning of grammar 
courses. 
Some of the detailed facts in the tabulations may be used 
as concrete illustrations of these two propositions: 
1. There is the widest variation among the different texts 
in the treatment of the same topic. 
2. There are marked inconsistencies in most of the texts 
in the relative importance attached to different phases of a 
general topic. 
Wide Variations in Emphasis——The most impressive fact 
in all of the tables is the wide variation in the total number 
of lines devoted to the large, general topics enumerated a 
few paragraphs back. 
The material dealing with ‘‘The Sentence” as a whole 
ranges all the way from 370 lines of text to 1,878 lines, while 
in the matter of exercises on the sentence the range is all the 
way from 381 to 1,449 lines. “Sentence Analysis” may be 
‘taken as an illustration of the variation between texts. Two 
of the recent books (the Elson and the Aldine) give no explana- 
tion of sentence analysis, while most of the texts devote in 
the neighborhood of 70 to 80 lines to this topic. 
The table dealing with nouns may be taken as another 
illustration of variation in emphasis. The total number of 
lines devoted to nouns ranges all the way from 145 to 1,084. 
On pronouns we find one book (the Driggs) giving only 
190 lines of discussion and explanation with 359 lines of 
exercises, while all other texts range higher in the matter of 
explanation, up to 1,205 in the highest (the Baskerville and 
Sewell), and only one text (the Pearson-Kirchwey) exceeds
-P-A-G-E-195
Present-day Practice and Plan for Revision 197 
the first named (the Driggs) in number of lines of 
exercises. 
Case forms of pronouns, which on the basis of usage and 
error we judged to be a rather important topic, is given no 
explanation in two of the most recent texts, and very little 
in two of the others, while three of the older texts devote 
from 125 to 150 lines to the subject. 
The more recent when compared with some of the older 
texts, give scant attention »to the explanation of case uses 
but give as much or more to exercises on the subject. 
Some Marked Inconsistencies.—A few items from the table 
that was made on “‘Case Uses’’ may serve to illustrate some of 
the inconsistencies of grammar-text making. The relative 
amount of attention given to the different constructions of 
the genitive case is one of the best illustrations. Our previous 
analyses have shown that the genitive of connection outranks 
the possessive use, and both far exceed the use of genitives 
with the gerund. On the basis of use and error combined, the 
relative importance of these three constructions would be 
similar to that founded on usage alone. 
One grammar (Baskerville-Sewell) devotes 45 lines to the 
genitive case as a whole, with no special attention to the uses 
of possession and connection, while 61 lines are devoted to 
the treatment of the genitive with the gerund. Another 
text (the Pearson-Kirchwey) deals with the genitive case 
uses by devoting 2 lines to the genitive in general, 5 to the 
genitive of possession, 7 to the genitive of connection, and 
16 to the genitive with a gerund. One of the most surprising 
discoveries in the analysis of different texts was to find that 
one text, a recent, very popular, and, on the whole, most 
excellent text, has not a single line on any of these topics, 
—possessive modifiers, genitive case of nouns, genitive case of 
pronouns, or on any phase of the uses of the genitive case. 
This text has entirely omitted any mention of one of the most 
important and difficult phases of written expression. 
Another important topic, and recognized as such by a 
number of grammarians, is that of “number” in nouns. One  
-P-A-G-E-196
198 How Much English Grammar? 
of the texts devotes 51 lines to the topic, another six times 
that number. 
The topic of tense forms may be taken as an illustration 
of both principles of variation and inconsistency. The num- 
ber of lines devoted to tense forms varies all the way from 31 
to 140 in the explanatory sections. The inconsistencies appear 
in the few lines devoted to the more important tenses, present 
and past, and the relatively large amounts to tenses not 
frequently used,—(notably in the Elson and in the Potter, 
Jeschke, and Gillet texts). 
The discussion of mood again illustrates the traditional 
evaluation, often so inconsistent with the principle of usage. 
Seven of the texts devote the major part of their discussions 
on mood to the subjunctive. All but one of these give the 
indicative mood but slight attention. 
The treatment of adjectives serves as a good illustration 
of variation in the attention given to a single large topic. One 
text (the Driggs) gives adjectives 194 lines of discussion, 
with 234 lines of exercises. Another (the Baskerville-Sewell) 
has 1,220 lines of discussion and 160 of exercises. In the 
classification of adjectives and in the discussion of degree 
there is the widest possible range. Some texts devote several 
hundred lines to topics not touched on at all in others, and 
texts giving extended discussions to certain topics completely 
disregard their own evaluation of them in the space devoted 
to exercises. 
' The treatment of prepositions shows again how one topic 
may receive excessive discussion when compared with all the 
others. Six of the most popular texts devote less than 100 
lines each to the discussion of prepositions, while one text 
(the Baskerville-Sewell) has 693. 
A separate table kept on the ‘‘Uses of the Infinitive” 
shows that a few text-book writers have had the courage to 
eliminate some of the topics which were shown in our study 
of usage to be comparatively worthless. Two of the recent 
texts (the Aldine and the Driggs) give no discussion or exer- 
cises on the uses of the infinitive. One of the earlier texts 
(the Whitney) devotes 203 lines of discussion and 51 of exercises
-P-A-G-E-197
Present-day Practice and Plan for Revision 199 
while another older text (the Baskerville-Sewell) devotes 121 
lines of explanation, and 31 of exercises to this topic. Three 
more recent books (the Blount-Northup, the Manly-Bailey, and 
the Pearson-Kirchwey) give 112, 163, and 122 lines of ‘“‘text”’ 
and 89, 45, and 108 lines of exercises respectively. 
Developments in the Language Course-—The results of the 
detailed tabulation were analyzed in a comparative way. 
Some of these results may be presented in condensed tabular 
summaries, which will reveal the broad outlines of modern 
tendencies in the language-grammar course.

From these tables it must seem quite clear that two general 
preliminary statements in regard to the course of study in 
grammar in the elementary schools may safely be made:— 
1. That no subject in the elementary curriculum has under- 
gone so much change and revision in Nee years as the course 
in grammar. 
2. That for none of the subjects in the elementary curric- 
ulum has there been so little basis in careful investigation 
for the changes that have been made.

Reduction in Amount of Technical Grammar.—The former of 
these statements can easily be verified by reference to several 
or all of the succeeding summary tables. 
The first of these, Table 98, shows that there has been a 
reduction of 50 per cent in the amount of technical grammar 
in the text-books during the last forty years. Most of this 
reduction has occurred during the last twenty years, if the 
texts selected may be judged to be fairly representative.

of the books as between “text,” devoted to rules, definitions, 
and explanations of grammatical technique on the one hand, 
and ‘exercises’ on the other. It will be seen that there has 
been a remarkable transition from the mere memoriza- 
tion of text material to the application of rules in practice 
work. The percentage of space devoted to exercises increases 
from 17 per cent in the Whitney grammar to approximately 
three times that amount in the more recent books. 
Composition and Rhetoric in the Grades.—Next we note the 
introduction of material in the grammar texts along lines of
-P-A-G-E-199
Present-day Practice and Plan for Revision 201 
composition and rhetoric to such an extent that in many cases 
the importance of the newer element is justified by the selection 
of a title for the text-book that does not feature the idea of 
technical “grammar,” but rather indicates the tendency to 
have the work considered as “language”? work. Such titles 
as “The Mother Tongue,” ‘Studies in English,” etc. indicate 
the tendency. The analysis of the contents of these texts 
shows (see Table 100) that the amount devoted to composi- 
tion and rhetoric material in the language-grammar books for 
the upper grades ranges from zero in the earlier texts to one- 
third or more of the total number of pages in the more recent 
books. 
Literature in the Language Texts——A fourth tendency con- 
cerns the introduction of material devoted to the study of 
literature. The amount of such material included in the 
language-grammar books is not by any means a complete 
indication of the movement for the modification of the course 
of study in “English” in the upper grades. A great deal 
of this sort of work has been introduced with the use of 
English classics similar to, but of a simpler kind than, those 
used in the English courses in the high school. Taking the 
figures as they stand, however, in the language texts them- 
selves, it may be seen that there is a considerable use of this 
sort of material, and that in one text it constitutes fully one- 
fourth of the book. It is pertinent to remark in this connec- 
tion that such material is introduced in the elementary schools 
with a double purpose in mind far more clearly than is the case 
with the high school. In the latter, the study of English 
classics is more frankly devoted to a development of apprecia- 
tion; but in the elementary schools, in addition to this cultural 
aim, there is the aim of using the material for the purpose of 
influencing the pupils’ language habits. (See Table 100.) 
Two other elements must be noted to make the broad 
analysis of grammar texts complete. 
Some of the books deal with punctuation in such a way that 
a record could be kept of the varying amounts given to this 
topic. The facts are shown in Table 101.

In the same table are given the number of lines of ‘“distine- 
tive material” found in each text. In some of the language 
books, there are many topics not concerned with technical 
grammar, composition, rhetoric, or literature, as, for instance: 
Spelling Difficulties, Homonyms, The History of the English 
Language, Idioms and Slang, The Meaning and Use of 
Grammar, The Divisions of Grammar, Etymology, The Use of 
Italics, Small Capitals, Explanations of Inflection and 
Syntax, ete. 
Suggestions for Revision of Language Courses.—From the 
studies that have been made, both of developmental trends 
in language usage and of errors in speech and composition, 
it seems within bounds to say that the last few years of the 
elementary school and the early high-school years constitute 
the critical period for language mastery. These years corre- 
spond roughly to the period during which the most intensive 
work in technical grammar drill has heretofore been carried on. 
It is only in connection with the recent modification of this 
strictly technical course that language texts have been adopted 
for the lower grades as a part of a series of so-called graded 
lessons. No effort was made in the present study to trace 
this development in the elementary school curriculum, for 
the general situation is well-known to those familiar with the 
history of courses of study. 
In our analysis of the text books, perhaps the most striking 
fact shown is the transition from parsing, classification, 
analysis, and drill on rules and definitions to the type of 
exercise that compels expression, or functional application 
of grammatical technique. The increased emphasis on “‘exer- 
cises”’ in recent years might mean nothing by itself. But 
when the spirit of many of the “exercises” is examined care- 
fully and is taken in connection with the rapid extension of 
“composition” work in the books, the trend toward functional 
language work must be recognized as a decided improve- 
ment in the school courses. If the emphasis put on the over- 
coming of common errors in the last five years is also 
considered, we will recognize more than a desire to meet the 
actual needs; we will discern some progress in the direction 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
  204 How Much English Grammar? 
that will have to be followed in continuing our revision of 
school courses in language and grammar. 
Drastic Eliminations Needed.—The first need in grammatical 
revision is a thorough-going elimination of all but the ele- 
ments of technical grammar. The revelations of the Kansas 
City and other error studies showed the need for drill on only 
a few critical forms. The conclusions from the present 
study should reinforce the suggestions growing out of the 
error studies. If we must have a complete ‘résumé of tech- 
nical grammar, with its rules, definitions and classifications, 
convenient for occasional reference, this might easily be con- 
densed into a compact outline of a few pages to be relegated 
to an appendix in a language book for the upper grades or 
the junior high school, so that teachers would have the slight- 
est possible temptation to use it for ‘‘recitation” purposes. 
This would leave the main body of the text book free for 
constructive exercises in the use of the most common and the 
most needed elements, which have been pointed out in the 
summaries of the successive chapters. 
Developmental Trends Must Be Stimulated.—The present 
study brings out neéds in the development of language mastery 
that have not been recognized heretofore, either in the earlier 
technical treatment or even in recent reforms based on error 
studies. By establishing adult standards of usage, and by 
comparing usage in school compositions, often in the form 
of clearly-marked developmental trends, with the adult 
standards, two valuable principles were impressed: 
1. Constructions helpful in securing precision, simplicity, 
or variety in expression are not developed rapidly and uni- 
formly enough for effective language mastery. 
2. Some of the more valuable grammatical devices seem 
to be consciously avoided for several years when there is 
probably a growing need for help to overcome language 
difficulties. 
Every one of the constructions and devices that appeared 
to be of this nature from an analysis of the statistics was 
pointed out in its proper connection. It only remains here 
to repeat in a general way the constructive values that can
-P-A-G-E-203
Present-day Practice and Plan for Revision 205 
be gained from introducing in the language work exercises, 
even though they be artificial, which shall so familiarize the 
pupil with these constructions as to make their use easy and 
ready as a substitute for the more clumsy circumlocutions 
that are commonly used. On the basis of these developmental 
trends toward the adult standard, we have the cue for an 
enrichment of the content and an improvement of the method 
in language courses that should prove most valuable in the 
pupils’ language control. 
Basis for Revision of Grammar Texts.—We may now, in 
conclusion, compare in summary form the evidence for revi- 
sion and elimination in grammar texts in the light of our 
criteria of adult usage and common errors. The specific 
topics discovered for emphasis or elimination in the revised 
language course were pointed out in detail in connection with 
each of the main divisions of grammar taken up in Chapters 
II to XI. Important phases of development in language 
mastery were also described in connection with the various 
tables and diagrams relating to school usage. 
It only remains, therefore, to recapitulate, in a very general 
way, the principles of the grammar curriculum that have 
been presented in the summary sections of each of the chapters. 
I. Much of the traditional course in grammar may safely 
be relegated to an appendix in the text book. We have atleast 
two scientific criteria, frequency of usage and frequency of 
error, to show what refinements of logical technique have no 
place in a course which has such an important function as 
the inculcating of correct habits of speech and writing, and 
which has so largely failed in its outcome because the time 
devoted to the subject has not been profitably employed. So 
much time has been taken on non-essentials in classification, 
analysis, and parsing that the important functional values 
could not be adequately emphasized. 
II. The fundamental method of determining the content of 
an English grammar course must be, with only occasional 
exceptions, the relative frequencies of usage. 
(a) This method is more complete in its analysis than the 
only other scientific method that has been applied,—the fre-  
-P-A-G-E-204
  206 How Much English Grammar? 
quency of error. Every item of technical grammar can be 
considered and given its relative value. 
(b) This method must precede the analysis of error. 
While the latter may serve to modify in some cases the findings 
according to frequency of usage, it can only draw conclusions, 
if employed by itself, from the relative frequency of individual 
types of error, either on a basis of percentages of the whole 
number of errors, as was done in the Charters-Miller study, 
or on a basis of ranking, as was done in the Lyman and Johnson 
studies. While in some cases, these bases of comparison and 
evaluation yield valuable results, still it was shown clearly in 
Chapter X that exaggerated importance may be given to 
one type of error; or an undervaluation of the seriousness of 
the error may result in other cases. Other methods of weight- 
ing the errors must be experimented with, but the ‘error 
quotient,” wherever it can be determined, can never be 
disregarded. An error which occurs five times in five chances 
is far more important to deal with than one that occurs ten 
times in a hundred chances. The latter must be attacked 
from an entirely different angle. It is not an error of igno- 
rance, as the former probably is. It is not a knowledge of 
grammar we have to impart in the case of errors which fre- 
quency of usage shows to be a matter of mere carelessness, 
even if such errors may outnumber others in any given body 
of material. 
III. However, as a complementary principle to the fore- 
going, it is also true that frequency of usage cannot alone be 
taken as a criterion of grammatical teaching. It has been 
pointed out in detail, in the summaries, that there are a number 
of grammatical phenomena which occur very frequently. 
But, since they seem to offer no opportunity for error, their 
relative importance on the basis of frequency in use must be 
modified. Other constructions present such evidence of com- 
mon violation that they must be emphasized out of proportion 
to their relative frequency of use. 
On the basis of these two complementary principles of 
usage and error, what topics should be emphasized in the 
English grammar course and what topics may be eliminated
-P-A-G-E-205
    Present-day Practice and Plan for Revision 207 
will now be stated in a summary list, the detailed facts for the 
reasons given for such evaluation having been presented in 
the discussion in Chapters II to XI. 
1. THE SENTENCE, ITS FORM AND STRUCTURE. 
(a) The distinction between simple, compound, and com- 
plex sentences is fundamental. The correct use of clauses 
hinges on the understanding of the distinction between 
complex sentences and the other two types. Violations of 
sentence completeness often hinge on the lack of clear under 
standing between the principal and dependent: clause dis- 
tinctions. Important rules of punctuation hinge on both the 
compound and complex sentence structure. Refinements of 
classification, such as compound-complex and complex-com- 
pound, are unwarranted on the basis of usage. 
(b) The emphasis on the distinctions according to mean- 
ing,—the declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclama- 
tory forms,—seems far less important; on the basis of usage, 
the distinction warrants no emphasis. The chances for error 
in punctuation of the interrogative and exclamatory sentences 
are so rare that this principle can give very little basis for 
endless exercises in classification. 
2. CLAUSES. 
(a) The three types of clauses,—adverbial, adjectival and 
substantive,—are practically of equal importance so far as 
frequency of usage is concerned. The drill on classification 
exercises seems unwarranted, however, since the functional 
distinctions serve no purpose in sentence control. 
(6) The distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive 
adjectival clauses should be emphasized. The rule for the 
comma, with non-restrictive clauses, so often violated and 
usually so important for clearness, occurs frequently enough 
to receive attention. 
(c) The entire sections on the uses or constructions of. sub- 
stantive clauses and on the distinction of adverbial clauses as 
to meaning might be eliminated. These have been over- 
worked phases of the analytical grammars, but the distinctions 
serve no purpose in English speech control.
-P-A-G-E-206
  208 How Much English Grammar? 
3. PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES. 
This section should receive attention, so far as frequency 
of use is concerned; but error studies show the difficulty here 
is not one of a grammatical nature. Word studies, in a 
language course, may well put emphasis on diction faults in 
the use of the wrong prepositions or on types often confused. 
4, THE NON-MODAL VERB FORMS. : 
(a) The infinitives, participles, and gerunds, are all quite 
important so far as frequency of use is concerned. Error. 
studies emphasize this importance. 
(b) But: the type of material presented in the course in 
grammar should be quite different from that now commonly 
taught. Much of the material on non-modal forms in the 
texts, except in a few of the more recent books, deals with the 
uses of the infinitive and the constructions of the substantive 
infinitive. The criteria of both use and error advise that 
such material should be eliminated; material having reference 
to such topics as ‘“‘split infinitives,” the genitive case use with 
the gerund, and especially the confusion of past participle and 
past tense forms, would prove far more helpful. 
5. PARTS OF SPEECH. 
We have a general, fundamental guide as to the relative 
importance of the various parts of speech and the treatment 
each should be given, in the relative percentage of each in the 
total number of words. This has already been presented in the 
summary discussion in Chapter V, and need not be repeated 
here. We will take up the parts of speech in succession and 
state the topics for emphasis and elimination in connection 
with each. 
6. NOUNS. 
(a) Declension should be simplified and the time devoted 
to it should be reduced. 
(6) One case, the genitive, demands considerable emphasis; 
probably all the attention that is given to declension might be 
devoted to this case, considered on the basis of frequency of 
error rather than on the basis of frequency of use. However,
-P-A-G-E-207
  
  
  Present-day Practice and Plan for Revision 209 
this is a striking illustration of the need of weighting error by 
usage: In the Charters-Miller list, the errors in possessive 
cases rank fifth. Computation according to “error quotients”’ 
shows that this is probably the most important of all grammat- 
ical errors outside of those involving punctuations. 
(c) Along with the simplification of declension should go 
simplification of the case constructions of nouns, at least the 
nominative, dative, and accusative. A few exceptions, per- 
haps, should be made for the nominative of address, or excla- 
mation, because of punctuation difficulties, but these need not 
be taught in connection with the technique of inflection. 
Similarly, a simple treatment of appositives is necessary, but 
not for each of the cases as construction forms. 
(d) Frequency of use also indicates that a different inter- 
pretation should be put on the genitive case. Its use to 
express ‘‘connection” far exceeds its use to express ‘‘posses- 
sion.” The change in nomenclature from “possessive case’’ to 
“genitive case” is fully warranted. 
(e) The puzzling exercises so often used in the parsing of 
nouns as to their classification as common, abstract, ete., 
serve no useful purpose. The whole section might be elimi- 
nated, except the identification of proper nouns for the sake of 
capitalization. Both frequency and error criteria emphasize 
this view. 
7. PRONOUNS. 
(a) The declension of pronouns as an important topic 
in grammar is fully warranted both by the criterion of usage 
and that of error. But on the same grounds, some of 
the constructions in the various cases may either be eliminated 
or treated very briefly. In the nominative case, the construc- 
tions of “address,” “exclamation,” and “absolute with a 
participle’? may be slighted. In the accusative case all con- 
structions except the direct object, object of a preposition 
and subject of an infinite clause may safely be eliminated. 
About 95 per cent of the cases are included in these three 
constructions. 
(b) A matter relating to pronouns which was not recorded 
in connection with the frequency of usage, and for which 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  210 How Much English Grammar? 
chances could not be tallied in the study of errors, but which 
is shown to be of considerable importance by the frequencies 
of error, has to do with the agreement of pronouns with their 
antecedents. This involves both personal and relative pro- 
nouns. Considerable emphasis upon this phase of the study 
of pronouns is warranted. 
(c) Sections of grammar devoted to the division of 
pronouns into classes—personal, relative, etc.—have been too 
extended and the refinement carried too far for the sake of 
completeness. Reciprocal, intensive, identifying, and even 
interrogative pronouns are infrequent, and may be slighted. 
Whatever attention is given to the others should relate to 
case forms and construction, rather than to class distinctions 
in parsing exercises. 
8. ADJECTIVES. 
(a) For the sake of capitalization the topic of proper adjec- 
tives must be emphasized. While frequency of usage does 
not show a great need for emphasis, the criterion of error 
possibilities advises emphasis. 
(6) In the matter of comparison of irregular adjectives, 
frequency of usage warrants considerable emphasis, and fre- 
quency of error demands it. 
(c) The same refinement of classification made in pronouns 
is often carried over in the text books to the classification of 
pronominal adjectives. The classification of pronominal adjec- 
tives serves no useful purpose. The time devoted to this 
should rather be given to a few characteristic errors, like the 
substitution of a personal pronoun for a demonstrative pro- 
nominal adjective, for instance. The error can be attacked 
without wasting time on the classification. Constructive 
exercises to stimulate a freer use of pronominal adjectives 
should also be employed. 
(d) Articles constitute a large factor in one’s vocabulary. 
However, they offer such a small field for error,—the use of 
the wrong indefinite article——that attention need be given 
only to this matter.
-P-A-G-E-209
  
  Present-day Practice and Plan for Revision 211 
(e) While a separate record was kept of the numerals, 
there seems to be no reason why they should be given more 
than slight attention as a possible subdivision of the adjective. 
9. ADVERBS. 
Adverbs constitute a minor part of the total vocabulary 
and present little occasion for error. The irregular adverbs 
are mostly the “‘more” and “most” modifiers of adjectives in 
comparisons, with occasional use of these, or others of the 
irregular adjective forms, in adverbial functions. The whole 
matter can be taken care of almost entirely in connection 
with the subject of comparison of adjectives, although a 
review of the irregular forms in the new connection would 
not be out of place. 
10. CoNJUNCTIONS. 
As separate parts of speech, the conjunctions require but 
little discussion. The place for their treatment will be in 
their functional connections with compound and complex 
sentences. 
11. VERBS. 5 
(a) The whole matter of verbs, because of conjugational 
complexities, warrants extended treatment in the course in 
grammar. 
(b) Some of the forms, introduced or retained for complete- 
ness, may probably be given more summary treatment than is 
customary, following the criterion of infrequent usage. Labored 
emphasis on subjunctive forms seems unwarranted. We find 
these constitute only eight-tenths of 1 per cent of the predi- 
cates, with about three for every 200 sentences. The few 
forms most commonly used should be given attention without 
memorization and drill on the whole paradigm of the subjunc- 
tive mood. 
(c) Another matter often overdone is the uses of “shall” 
and ‘‘will,” non-future. Popular usage seems determined to 
over-rule the grammatical niceties here, and, after all, judging 
by infrequency of usage, there is little occasion for the quarrel. 
The non-future uses of “shall”? and “will” occur about once 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
212 How Much English Grammar? 
in every 250 sentences; the future tense uses constitute 4.5 
per cent of all tense forms. We find a future tense in only 
every tenth sentence, and the future perfects are very rare. 
(d) Emphasis on the different tense forms should be far 
from equally distributed, with the present and past forms 
receiving the largest part of the attention. 
VY. Present-day school practice in the teaching of grammar, 
in view of the objective studies in both usage and error, must, 
then, be quite radically revised. It is especially evident that 
extensive eliminations of technical grammar are advisable, 
while the retention of a number of topics isequally indispensible. 
VI. The relative importance of the various remaining 
essential topics can be determined. This has been fully 
outlined in Section IV. 
VII. Previous studies in the matter of errors will have to 
be revised by some system of weighting. Several are sug- 
gested. That of ‘Error Quotients” was attempted, but the 
results cannot be considered highly satisfactory. A weighting 
according to judgments as to relative “heinousness” is also 
suggested. 
VIII. Different standards of content can and should be 
determined for different levels of school work. There is such 
clear evidence of development in grammatical usage from the 
grammar-school stage to maturity that instruction in language 
work can be graded quite accurately with reference to needs at 
almost every stage of advancement. The material in such 
a course is quite generally graded in practice now, as an 
examination of the texts and of superintendents’ manuals 
shows. But the grading is largely a matter of guess work, 
or a distribution of material on logical considerations. There 
are two definite, objective modes of approach to scientific 
grading,—different usage at different levels, and persistence of 
errors at different ages. Even if we were to admit that the 
study of technical grammar functions in language mastery, our 
‘present methods of grammar teaching and our selection of 
subject-matter are seriously at fault in teaching a large body 
of technique long before it is needed, or before the child has a 
working knowledge of the distinctions involved. Scientific
-P-A-G-E-211
  
  Present-day Practice and Plan for Revision 213 
principles of language mastery can be deduced from psycholog- 
ical principles of language usage, supplemented by con- 
siderations of errors, their frequency, persistence and social 
seriousness. All of these factors can be quantitatively 
determined.

PREFACE 
Wurtz the socialized recitation is no solution for 
all the problems of teaching, much less a cure-all for 
the evils of society in general, it offers such great 
possibilities for the development of the individual 
pupil and the realization of the social purpose of the 
school that it deserves the attention of all progressive 
teachers. 
It is the purpose of this little volume to show the 
place which the socialized recitation may have in the 
modern school, to emphasize its possibilities in the 
mastery of subject matter as well as in the cultivation 
of social ideals and practices on the part of the chil- 
dren in our schools, to present enough concrete material 
to make the technique clear to the teacher who wishes 
to use the method, to give a vivid view of the dangers 
to be avoided, and to show in some detail the qualities 
which need to be cultivated, 
The thanks of the author are due especially to Dr. 
Ernest Horn for helpful suggestions after reading the 
manuscript and for supplying the stenographic report 
of one of the lessons presented in Chapter IV; and 
to Miss Bessie L. Pierce of the University (of Iowa) 
High School for similar service.

THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 
CHAPTER I 
WEAKNESS OF THE INDIVIDUALISTIC RECITATION 
Meaning of Recitation. — The term recitation has 
come to mean not merely the activity involved in 
re-citing to a teacher facts which the pupil has gathered 
by studying his textbook, but rather'any and all ac- 
tivities that take place in the class period.) In ordinary 
procedure the teacher assigns work, the pupil studies, 
and then appears for a recitation in which he goes over 
the material upon which he has been concentrating his 
intellectual efforts. Where mere mastery of subject 
matter is the aim of teacher and pupil, it would seem 
that such a method of procedure would be not only 
natural but adequate. However, in these days of 
growing democracy and increasing effort toward social- 
ization, there has grown up a feeling that studying and 
reciting do not provide all that is desirable in an ade- 
quate scheme of education. 
For the sake of understanding the growing movement 
toward some more adequate process of socialization, 
such as is seen in the various forms of the socialized 
recitation, it may be well to examine the origin and 
nature of the process which is now deemed less than 
adequate.

2 The Socialized Recitation 
Origin of the Class Method. — The universal method 
of imparting knowledge is from individual to individ- 
ual. The mother instructs her child; the master trains 
his apprentice; the artist develops his pupil; the re- 
ligious worker gives personal attention to the convert. 
Yet the economy of handling students in groups for 
the work of instruction is so obvious that it is not 
strange that from very early times-we find teachers 
presenting materials of education to larger or smaller 
groups. In contrast with this economy, however, 
stands the loss of time when, in the process of re- 
citing, a dozen or a score of pupils stand or sit doing 
nothing while some individual pours forth what has 
been poured in or absorbed. In earlier times every 
teacher believed firmly what few believe now: that 
if mastery is to be gained, it is necessary that every 
pupil recite all of every lesson. For this reason we 
find that class instruction grew up before class reci- 
tation. 
We also find that when the device of the class reci- 
tation was introduced, it had a background of the 
individualistic idea. The social significance of group- 
ing pupils seems to have had no connection with the 
introduction of the class idea. Indeed, the class was 
little more than an aggregation of individuals,-each of 
whom was expected to do the same work as every 
other. ‘Hach for himself” was the motto of the 
individuals in the so-called class, just as truly as it 
would have been had each been instructed by a tutor 
at home. 
Development of the Class Method. — Whatever 
may have been the origin of the idea of class recitation, 
4
-P-A-G-E-13

it seems that the spread of the monitorial school idea 
had much to do with popularizing the practice in this 
country. With its division into groups, with its ar- 
rangement to have work for all done by various moni- 
tors, but with its emphasis upon individualism in the 
actual treatment of subject matter, it may be char- 
acterized as having the form of social organization 
“but denying the power thereof.” Each pupil was 
expected to fit into his little groove; but that groove 
was of the same character as that of every other pupil. 
The success of the scheme depended more upon the 
idea of non-interference with others than upon that 
of actual codperation in the accomplishment of work 
of common interest. 
As the free school idea spread and as attendance 
grew, it became necessary to use the system of class 
organization even where there was no desire to adopt 
the monitorial idea. The solution of the problem of 
popular education was to be found only in a form of 
organization which made it possible for a single teacher 
to give instruction to a large number of pupils. People 
were not accustomed to spending much money for 
education. Consequently the only kind of education 
which it was possible to introduce was one which 
showed a high degree of economy. 
Especially in this country did school attendance 
develop to an extent far beyond the dreams of early 
advocates of popular education. The development 
of the technique of class management (rather than 
individual treatment) necessarily had to parallel the 
expansion of the school population. But when the 
small district school developed into the larger town
-P-A-G-E-14
    4 The Socialized Recitation 
school, there still remained vestiges of the old days 
when each pupil was a class unto himself, when the 
chief virtue of the student (from the teacher’s point of 
view) was to let his neighbors work in peace and quiet. 
A most obvious relic of the individualistic days is to be 
seen in the unfortunate rural school in which there 
are six pupils and about thirty classes ! 
Thus there developed an individualistic rather than a 
social method, but one with social by-products. It is 
not to be inferred that a group of active children could 
be kept in hermetically sealed cells during a recitation 
period. In so far as subject matter was concerned, 
that state of isolation practically existed; for each 
student was concerned only with his own tasks — 
even though they were exactly the same as those of 
other students. There were, however, certain social 
by-products not connected directly with the material 
of instruction. These grew out of the scholastic 
warfare between teacher and taught, the pupils fre- 
quently uniting in a common feeling of antagonism 
toward the one person who was looked upon as the 
natural enemy of all, — the teacher. 
Thus it often came about that pupils learned the 
social virtue of codperation through joining together 
in order to practice a kind of intellectual sabotage at 
the apparent expense’ of the teacher. In order to 
“kill time” the crafty pupil learned to coéperate 
with his fellows in getting through work with as little 
speed as possible. Getting the teacher to talk on 
some favorite topic was a frequent method of con- 
cealing the fact that the members of the class were 
not prepared on the material which had been assigned.
-P-A-G-E-15
  Weakness of the Individualistic Recitation 5 
Rambling off into various bypaths was an obvious 
method of filling in time without the drudgery of 
mastering the day’s tasks. Any method of “ throwing 
sand into the works” was esteemed commendable 
from the point of view of the pupils. Thus on the 
plane of the intellectual work of the school the students 
were merely isolated individuals; but on the plane 
of anti-teacher activities they were united by a common 
bond. 
So far as conscious recognition and planning by the 
school were concerned, pupils were merely individuals ; 
but human nature continually asserted itself in mani- 
festations-of the inborn capacity and desire to work 
together. The figure of speech by which the school 
was likened to a race course failed to apply, because 
the children insisted on stopping to play by the wayside 
instead of running each along his definitely marked 
course. i 
From the preceding characterization it might appear 
to one not familiar with our schools that there is in 
the ordinary class no possibility of social activity 
on the plane of subject matter. Such, however, is far 
from being the case; for there has been a growing 
recognition of the fact that wherever several persons 
are gathered together for the pursuit of any common 
object a certain amount of mutual help is not only 
possible but desirable. 
Where subject matter is relatively simple and me- 
chanical, as in spelling or in the fundamental processes 
of arithmetic, the amount of codperation is generally 
slight. But in those more complex and more intellec- 
tual subjects in which interpretation, forming of judg-
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 The Socialized Recitation 
ments, and discussion are essential to mastery, the 
pupil suffers an actual loss if he is not permitted to 
receive the benefit of the intellectual struggles of his 
fellow students. His own development is made much 
more difficult and slow if he is not permitted to express 
his ideas to others and receive the benefit of theirs. 
Thus it has happened that without conscious recog- 
nition of the principle of the socialized recitation many 
thoughtful teachers of such subjects as history, geog- 
raphy, literature, and composition have been tending 
in the direction of increasing codperation and intel- 
lectual fellowship among pupils. It has been dis- 
covered that the mastery of certain kinds of subject 
matter by the individual is made easier and more 
certain by a certain amount of activity that can be 
characterized as social. It even seems to be true that 
the mere physical presence of others is an aid to in- 
dividual effort. Consequently we have seen in recent 
years a growing socialization of school work — cur- 
riculum, methods, and organization — even where the 
ideal continues to be individualistic. 
Common Directs 
Theordinary class recitation, however, is likely to have 
certain defects, a knowledge of which may be helpful in 
the development of the socialized recitation by serving 
to prevent their being carried over from the old into the 
new, or, if they are inherent in all forms of social activity, 
by making it possible to minimize their evil results. 
The monopoly of activities by a few is one of 
the commonest defects. In almost every class, no 
matter how conscientious and skillful the teacher,
-P-A-G-E-17
  Weakness of the Individualistic Recitation 7 
it is likely to happen that a few brighter and more 
energetic pupils will monopolize most of the time of 
the class period. The result is that the duller, slower, 
or more diffident pupils fail to receive the benefit 
which comes from activity in reciting, discussing, and 
questioning. If the teacher attempts to remedy 
this defect by giving attention to the weak in propor- 
tion to their need, the stronger pupils are likely to 
feel that they are paying a penalty for the presence 
of those who are not their equals, or, more likely, to 
welcome the retarded pace of the class as an oppor- 
tunity to take a short vacation. 
The defect here lies in human nature; and no scheme 
of organization can render all pupils equally intelligent, 
industrious, conscientious, or skillful. In the ordinary 
recitation, however, there is often considerable loss 
because of a failure to do so much as recognize the 
existence of such difficulties as have been mentioned. 
Dr. Ernest Horn has published a monograph in 
which he gives the results of a study of “ The Distribu- 
tion of Opportunity for Participation among the 
Various Pupils in Class-room Recitations,” based upon 
ay investigation of ‘the classes of 229 teachers in 
twenty-two different schools in nineteen different 
systems, in eleven different states.” He found that 
“ the fourth of the class doing most reciting participate 
about four times as much as the fourth of the class 
doing least reciting.” In addition to the element 
of differences in ability he believes that other factors 
contribute to bring about this increase, — among them 
being initiative, aggressiveness, talkativeness, and 
attractiveness of personality.
-P-A-G-E-18
The Socialized Recitation 
  Although the inequality between the highest fourth 
and the lowest fourth (measured in terms of any given 
quality) is less than is commonly supposed, the amount 
of reciting done by the fourth of the class ranking 
highest in the quality is greater than that done by the 
lowest fourth. He further found that pupils who 
are ranked highest in all-round ability by the teacher 
participate more in the activities of the school than do 
those who are ranked lower, —the best fourth doing 
about 40 per cent more reciting than the poorest fourth. 
Dr. Horn explains such inequality as exists by the 
following factors: ‘1. Pupils who are most compe- 
tent, in general, desire most to participate. 2. Those 
who most wish to participate tend to get to do it. 
8. The teacher feels the necessity of getting things 
done and so accepts the more ready and satisfac- 
tory answers of the bright pupils. 4. Human nature 
avoids error if possible, z.e. it is more pleasant to 
receive adequate contributions from pupils than those 
which are inadequate or incorrect.” 
Another interesting conclusion presented in this 
study is that there is an increase of inequality with 
advance in grade, —a condition which may be due 
to the fact that the teacher is more interested in subject 
matter and less in method of class procedure than is 
the teacher in lower grades, and to the further fact 
that pupils, being more mature, are more able to 
control class procedure. 
Lack of codperation is another common defect of 
the ordinary recitation. It is largely the outgrowth 
of the feeling that each pupil is pitted against every 
other in a more or less friendly race. To a certain
-P-A-G-E-19
  Weakness of the Individualistic Recitation 9 
extent this is true; but if it is carried very far it results 
in a group of Ishmaelites, with every pupil’s ‘ hand 
raised against ” his fellows. If this attitude should 
be carried from the school into later life it would mean 
such a condition of extreme individualism as would 
make coéperation in community or nation exceedingly 
difficult. Fortunately it does not seem that such 
transfer of characteristics from one field to another 
takes place with any degree of certainty. But whether 
or not the attitude of the Ishmaelite may be carried 
over frorn the school to later relationships, it is cer- 
tainly true that a class itself suffers if there is a very 
large amount of the spirit that regards every pupil as 
a rival rather than as a possible neighbor. 
The defect of lack of codperation is often the result 
of the attitude taken by the teacher, especially if he 
takes literally the figure of speech which likens school 
work to a race. If that be the case he is certain to 
frown on any tendency toward codperation, his frown 
possibly representing his disapproval of what he con- 
siders fundamentally immoral. If he has had proper 
religious training he is likely to fall back upon the 
suggestion of St. Paul that the runner is “‘ not crowned 
unless he strive lawfully,’ — lawfully being interpreted 
as meaning without assistance from others. When the 
teacher assumes such an attitude the whole process of 
socialization is likely to be hindered in his classes, as it 
always is among those whose philosophy of life is 
“ Hach for himself. Devil take the hindmost! ” 
Possibly the greatest defect in the ordinary recita- 
tion is the distorted sense of responsibility felt alike 
by teacher and pupils. It is to the teacher that pupils  
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 The Socialized Recitation 
are responsible in all matters. The teacher is respons- 
ible to some one else ; and so on to the top of the hier- 
archy. Jn a certain sense there is some truth in the 
conception that the teacher is a servant of society, 
Pe onable indincgl to aeckty Basach the medium 
of some person chosen to assist in the administration of 
education. It is also true that in the same sense the 
pupils are responsible to the teacher for the accomplish- 
ment of work which is to be done. 
In contrast with this incomplete view of the situation 
is the fact that the teacher is also responsible to the 
pupils as a guide in their social development; that the 
pupils are responsible to one another and to their group 
for the accomplishment of the most and the best 
possible; that they are also responsible to the people 
who maintain the school and thus make it possible 
for them to come into close contact with the means of 
individual development. Any view which makes it 
seem that the teacher is the chief or only source of 
responsibility is hopelessly distorted. Such a concep- 
tion places the teacher on the throne as a little autocrat 
who is monarch of all he surveys. 
Where the ideal of education is merely to “ pound 
in” a certain amount of subject matter, where the 
pupil is considered clay in the hands of the potter, 
where society is regarded as a mass of individuals 
reduced or elevated to a certain uniform level, the idea~ 
of the teacher as autocrat may not seem discordant 
with the generally accepted social views. But where 
the ideal of education is individual development, where 
pupils are regarded as personalities on their way to 
increasing freedom and responsibility, where the social “
-P-A-G-E-21
  Weakness of the Individualistic Recitation 11 
ideal is genuine codperation among individuals varied 
in capacity but equal in rights, the autocrat must give 
place to the guide. 
The tendency toward formalism or perfunctoriness 
is frequently characteristic of the ordinary recitation. 
Pupils often go through the motions of intellectual 
work without any very great attention to the signifi- 
cance of what they are doing —the natural conse- 
quence of a situation from which the social element is 
eliminated as much as possible. Where all the pupils 
are reciting the same thing to the teacher, where repeti- 
tion often occurs simply to see that different individuals 
have mastered the same subject matter, it is not 
strange that both the pupils who know and those who 
do not know shall come to regard the process of hearing 
the recitation as a rather formal matter. The pupil 
knows that he is making no contribution to the teacher’s 
knowledge; he also realizes that he is making as little 
to the members of his class. Consequently the tend- 
ency is often toward the formal — vital social stimulus 
being lacking. 
Plenty of ridicule has been heaped upon the oral read- 
ing lesson in which the pupils read paragraph by para- 
graph aselection with which all are familiar and in which 
the sole motive for staying awake is to discover mis- 
takes, the reward being the pleasure of saying, ‘‘ He 
said pin for pen.’’ But high school work in literature, 
mathematics, and foreign language may be just as 
deadly when the formal presentation of material by 
individuals takes the place of vital effort to satisfy a 
social motive. 
The ordinary class recitation is a mixture of strength
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 The Socialized Recitation 
and weakness. It is probably never without some of 
the aspects of social activity, although the amount 
may often be very small. In reality we find that the 
degree of socialization ranges between two limits: 
zero as a minimum and 100 per cent as a maximum. 
To the extent that the recitation secures individual 
activity and development it is good; but to the extent 
that it fails to secure social (that is, group) activity and 
the development of the social aspects of individuality 
it is weak. 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  CHAPTER II 
WHAT THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION TRIES TO 
ACCOMPLISH 
It is of course obvious that the purpose back of the 
socialized recitation lies deeper than the mere surface 
activities of a group of pupils composing a class. The 
fundamental aim goes to the very depths of the spirit 
of the age, the desire for a more adequate democracy) 
Consequently we may take it for granted that the 
socialization sought in this modified form of the recita- 
tion is not the type which might be acceptable under 
an autocracy, but rather that which the more liberal 
countries are now trying to realize completely in gov- 
ernment and partly at least in industry. 
What then is meant by socialization? 
Tue Nature or SoctauizaTion 
In the first place it means the creation and develop- 
ment of a feeling which binds the members of a group 
in such a way as to make them a unit. It is the 
feeling which makes the individual regard himself a 
real part of the group and which causes him to identify 
his interest with group interests while he looks upon 
the common motives, purposes, and activities as ours 
rather than as mine. Its presence makes the boy gang, 
the baseball club, the basket-ball team, the fraternity, 
the family, the church, and even the state. Its 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 The Socialized Recitation 
absence means the failure of any kind of athletic team, 
the disruption of the family, the weakening of the 
church and the downfall of the state. The lack of this 
“we-feeling ’’ means one class of citizens arrayed 
against another, church fighting church, section antag- 
onizing section, and even labor group combating labor 
group. The growth of the feeling in such a way as to 
make every American regard all his fellow citizens as 
members of one great “‘ we-group ”’ is our one hope of 
keeping the Republic from the disruption that has 
marked the downfall of other great nations. The 
cultivation of the group feeling in school is similarly 
a means of solving those problems of discipline and 
method which grow out of the heterogeneous elements 
which compose the school population. 
Good will is an essential accompaniment of the 
feeling of oneness. Indeed it may seem that the 
presence of the “ we-feeling ” is of itself a guarantee 
that good will will also exist. Such, however, is not the 
case, — not always, at any rate. Among the ancient 
Greeks there was a more or less persistent feeling of 
the oneness of all the Greeks; but only rarely was 
there that good will which bound them together for 
effective codperation in large groups. Unity of action 
was mote likely to be the result of the menace of a 
common enemy than the outcome of a feeling of good 
will among the different elements of the Hellenic world. 
In efforts to coérdinate various educational, recrea- 
tional, and cultural activities in American communities 
a tremendous handicap is often discovered in existing 
suspicion and ill will affecting various individuals and 
groups. The process of socialization is delayed until a 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
What Socialized Recitation Accomplishes 15 
feeling of good will can be generated and diffused among 
the elements of the community or group. What is 
true of the community in this particular is also true of 
the class in school. There can be little progress in 
socialization unless pupils who feel that this is “ our 
group”’ likewise have a strong feeling of good will for 
one another. 
A further implication of socialization is the presence 
of common interests and purposes. Even a group 
like the family, bound together by ties of blood, by the 
feeling of ‘‘ our family,” by propinquity, and by early 
associations, will, unless there are common interests, 
gradually break into various elements wandering off 
from the original family circle. When other interests 
arise different from those which originally held them 
together, the members of almost any kind of group 
gradually fall apart and coalesce with other groups. 
The enormous importance of common interests and 
purposes in the process of socialization is further shown 
in the present movement toward the regeneration of a 
rapidly disappearing community life. It is only when 
common interests are present and discovered and when 
purposes become common to the large community group 
that the growth of a “ center ” is possible. 
Mere interest is not enough, however. It must be 
supplemented by activities in which it is possible for all 
to participate. A church, membership in which be- 
gins through the presence of a great religious interest 
but which does not provide for activities which call 
forth the efforts of individual members, cannot long 
remain a living organization. Likewise a fraternity, a 
lodge, any kind of voluntary social group will find 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
16 The Socialized Recitation 
interest decaying, the ‘‘ we-fecling’’ disappearing, 
unless there is frequent opportunity for the members 
of the group to participate in activities that are related 
to their common interests and purposes. 
A feeling of responsibility to the group may be 
mentioned as a final essential in the process of social- 
ization. This applies to both activities and achieve- 
ment, no mere random participation without socially 
desirable results being tolerable. Without this feeling 
of responsibility to the group it is almost certain that 
various antisocial practices will be characteristic of the 
actions of individuals. Instead of feeling the binding 
force of law as an expression of the will of his group, 
the antisocial individual is likely to have a certain 
amount of satisfaction in outwitting the police or 
hoodwinking the judge. In the smaller group, the 
school, the pupil who has not risen to a very high level 
of socialization is quite certain to find more delight 
in creating disorder behind the teacher’s back than in 
plain hard work as an outcome of his feeling of 
responsibility to the whole group. 
Socialization is a process in which the ‘“ we-feeling,’” 
good will, common interests and purposes, actual parti- 
cipation, and a feeling of responsibility to the group 
are essential elements. Through them the individual 
is transformed from potential membership into par- 
ticipating fellowship. In this transformation he ceases

What Socialized Recitation Accomplishes 17 
For the sake of being absolutely certain to avoid 
the common fallacy of assuming that all the char- 
acteristics which are read into the meaning of a general 
idea are equally true of each of the phases of experience 
which come under that generalization, it is well to note 
that while socialization is a term which is used to denote 
a type of human activity in which certain elements 
are characteristic, the process takes place on various 
planes and in various circles. We should be careful 
not to assume that because an individual is highly 
socialized in so far as the family circle is concerned he is 
equally socialized with respect to any other group. We 
should not even assume that socialization upon the 
community level means a corresponding result upon 
the plane of national life. 
It is ‘only a figure of speech to say that all humanity 
is but one large family, or that the nation is but one 
great community. Such a figure is helpful and .in- 
spiring; but, if taken literally, it is a great handicap 
to clear thinking. Socialization is an ever widening 
process in which much of the progress on lower levels 
undoubtedly enters into development on higher planes, 
but in which each higher stage or wider circle has its 
own characteristic elements, which cannot be supplied 
by other forms of socialization. 
Aims or THE SocrauizeD ReciTation 
The foregoing paragraphs indicate the general char- 
acter of the process of socialization, that is, the funda- 
mental aim of the socialized recitation. We now turn 
to the more immediate aims, those which it is necessary 
to have in mind in order to realize the fundamental
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 The Socialized Recitation 
purpose of the whole work. In this connection it will 
be necessary to discuss the following proximate aims: 
(1) providing a stimulating social setting for class work ; 
(2) finding satisfying activities; (3) providing the 
fundamentals of character development ; (4) preparing 
for larger social participation; (5) encouraging initia- 
tive; and (6) miscellaneous aims. 
Providing a stimulating social setting is the first 
proximate aim of the socialized recitation. The 
class then which wishes to transform itself from the 
ordinary formal type into a more highly socialized 
group has first of all the problem of finding a proper 
background, one that will provide a stimulating part 
of the environment. This means that a large part, if 
not all, of the stimulus should come from the various 
elements that go to make up the total setting as con- 
sidered from the internal rather than the external point 
of view. There should be stimulus from within the - 
group rather than compulsion from without. Pride 
in the success of the group or the experiment, desire 
to be helpful to others, an enlarging sense of responsibil- 
ity, the-wish for greater freedom, interest in investigat- 
ing a field of knowledge or solving some important 
problem, even the mere activity of others — all may be 
used to aid in providing that stimulating environment 
which is necessary to the success of any phase of 
socialization. To make this stimulating appeal is the 
first thing to be attempted; the manner in which it 
may be done is taken up in the next chapter. 
Finding satisfying activities is a second important 
aim. In the discussion of the nature of socialization 
it was emphasized that the success of any group depends
-P-A-G-E-29
  What Socialized Recitation Accomplishes 19 
in large measure upon the possibility of engaging in. 
the same or similar activities. It seems obvious that 
if the socialized recitation is to work out successfully 
there must be adequate provision for kinds of work 
that are clearly felt as satisfactory. Mere routine 
with no other object than satisfying thé teacher or 
meeting the requirements for graduation cannot 
provide that satisfying feeling that is essential in the 
process of socialization. Merely re-citing or re-hashing 
material which is in the textbook cannot serve the 
purpose. 
Almost any form of instruction has in it the possibility 
of providing a certain amount of satisfying activity, 
even when the feeling of satisfaction comes from nothing 
more than success in accomplishing a prescribed task. 
It is the work of the socialized recitation, however, to 
add other satisfactions, especially those of a social 
nature. An attempt is therefore made to provide 
activities which will contribute no less to the good of 
the individual, but which will also give that lively 
feeling of satisfaction which comes from contributing 
to the good of the group. 
Providing the fundamentals of character develop- 
ment is a very characteristic purpose of the socialized 
recitation. As the elements of moral character are 
essentially social, character being more the product 
of social action and reaction than of isolated individual 
activity, the socialized recitation attempts to provide 
an opportunity for the development of certain funda- 
mentals, such as good will, consideration for others, 
responsibility for honest effort, responsibility to the 
group rather than to an autocrat, aggressiveness in
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 The Socialized Recitation 
carrying on worthy work, willingness to give and take 
criticism. Although it is not believed that every trait 
of character which is cultivated in the socialized class 
will in some magic way carry over to every phase of 
life in school and out, it is hoped that such beginitings 
as are made will be influential in spheres wider than 
class or school. It is hoped that learning to codperate 
with others in a small way will be useful in activities 
which demand coéperation in a larger way, that learn- 
ing to receive criticism without resentment will have 
its effect upon home life, that loyalty to a small group 
will furnish some slight element in the development of 
larger loyalty. In the fact that the pupil becomes an 
actor rather than a mere absorber, a doer rather than 
a mere hearer, there is a beginning for character 
building. 
Preparing for larger social participation is an aim 
which must be kept continually in the foreground. 
In the conduct of the recitation in the old-fashioned 
way, the individual pupil had little opportunity to 
engage in any activity that was social in an adequate 
sense. Througli his re-citing to the teacher he [might 
contribute some fragment of knowledge to another 
pupil. His mistakes might warn against certain evils. 
But opportunities for group action were almost entirely 
lacking. Where school work is merely lesson-learning, 
it provides practically no training for those numerous 
phases of life out of school that demand participation 
upon the basis of membership in a codperating group- 
The socialized recitation attempts to remedy this 
defect by affording continual opportunity for social 
participation. iF
-P-A-G-E-31
  What Socialized Recitation Accomplishes 21 
In his attempts to master the subject matter of the 
school the pupil learns to participate in a social enter- 
prise, just as he will have to do later when he joins 
with others in the pursuit of any common purpose. 
As a member of society he will be expected to partici- 
pate in the affairs of the church, the fraternity, the 
lodge, the labor organization; as a pupil he learns to 
take ,his part in a social enterprise, the pursuit of 
knowledge, the carrying out of projects, the solution of 
problems, The socialized recitation thus gives him 
some opportunity to do in school the kind of thing that. 
fe wall he exnecied to doin. everyday life. 
neouraging initiative is as important as develop- 
ing social control. In the ordinary routine of school 
work, as in the army, the individual is told what to do, 
when to do it, and even how to do it. Under the 
conception of education as a pouring-in process or a 
clay-in-the-hands-of-the-potter affair, there could be 
no objection to a type of training which placed all 
responsibility for beginning, carrying on, and ending 
activities in the hands of a teacher. But when the 
aim of education is understood as socialization with a 
democratic life as its background, it begins to appear 
that mere pouring in or shaping is not enough. 
In order to secure real socialization it is necessary to 
encourage pupils to look forward to objectives the worth 
of which they appreciate, to codperate in making 
plans for the attainment of at least some of these 
objectives, and to have some freedom in the execution 
of their plans. As this idea is applied in the socialized 
recitation it means that pupils, instead of being flogged’ 
along the road to knowledge, initiate ways of getting
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 The Socialized Recitation 
over the road. As the idea actually works out those 
pupils who have some capacity for leadership have the 
opportunity to exercise it. Whatever initiative there 
is in a class is encouraged to come forth from any 
corner in which it may be lurking. 
Miscellaneous Details of Aim. — As the great defect 
of the ordinary recitation is the preponderance of 
the teacher, the socialized recitation aims to magnify 
the importance of pupil-activity. The monopolizing 
teacher-is replaced by group-activity. Furthermore, 
the formalism which often characterizes the work of 
the class as generally conducted is broken up by the 
freedom which is: necessary in the socialized class. 
The codperative pursuit of common purposes is used 
as a means of removing the lifelessness of the recitation 
of the cut-and-dried variety. 
Incidentally another end sought is that of solving the 
problem of discipline, especially as it exists in a situation 
where the pupils as a group and the teacher as the 
representative of external authority are mutually seen 
as antagonistic forces. Finally it may be said that 
a real rather than a seeming mastery of subject matter 
is sought, —a mastery which-is-to-be-madethe more 
‘certain because the pupil is striving not to satisfy the 
demands of external authority but to meet the needs 
of inner compulsion and to satisfy the expectation of 
his group. .

CHAPTER III 
HOW TO ORGANIZE THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 
- FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES 
A Process Suited to Needs. — In socializing children 
through the recitation, the purpose in view, the ma- 
terials available, and the wishes of the persons involved 
determine what form the organization shall take. In 
this matter the school may well emulate the attempts 
of other institutions to adjust organization to work to 
be done. We see that the national and state govern- 
ments have a fairly uniform scheme of organization 
with executive, legislative, and judicial branches quite 
clearly defined. Sometimes a similar form is adopted 
by the smaller units of government; but such a varia- 
tion as the commission plan of city government shows 
an attempt to make organization fit the actual needs 
of the unit concerned. 
In the various churches we have forms of organiza- 
tion adapted to the work to be done and the ideas of 
the people who form these institutions. Similarly in 
fraternities, lodges, literary societies, clubs, commercial 
enterprises, and philanthropic societies, we have varying 
forms of organization more or less suited to the various 
elements that form the situation calling forth the 
activities which demand some kind of machinery for 
their accomplishment. In like manner the organiza- 
23
-P-A-G-E-34
  QA The Socialized Recitation 
tion for the socialized recitation may and should vary 
according to the changing needs of the pupils con- 
cerned, the subject matter to be handled, and the 
ideals to be realized. No single form of organization 
can be considered the “only original and genuine 
article.” The first and most fundamental principle of 
organization is that of adaptation to the needs, condi- 
tions, and purposes of the persons concerned. 
To emphasize an idea so obvious as the principle 
expressed in the preceding paragraph may seem a waste 
of effort ; but already in the spread of the idea of social- 
izing the recitation there has begun to appear that 
blind following of precedent that is certain to make 
the whole movement unsatisfactory if not ridiculous. 
The teacher who tries to take over a ready-made plan 
from some other teacher without careful consideration 
of the conditions involved and the adaptability of the 
method of organization and administration to the class 
which is to be served is guilty of more than stupidity. 
He is guilty of criminal carelessness. 
Pupils who in trying to find a plan or organization 
that suits their ideas of codperative class action take 
over a ready-made scheme without much consideration 
and with no modifications to suit their peculiar needs 
may be forgiven on account of their lack of experience. 
The success of the socialized recitation, however, de- 
pends fundamentally upon working out a form of organ- 
ization which will meet the situation as it exists in the 
character of the pupils, the nature of subject matter, the 
essentials of the process of socialization, and the skill 
of the teacher. 
But the principle should be laid down that organiza- 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  How to Organize Socialized Recitation 25 
tion is not sacred. The selection of any particular 
plan at any time should not prevent modification, 
readjustment, or replacement when change promises 
to serve needs better. The effect will be bad in the 
long run if teacher or pupils fall into the clutches of 
any single form of organization. Actual service is 
the thing demanded of machinery. As long as that 
test is met, there is no need of change. When it is not 
met, the momentum of a system in operation should 
not be permitted to prevent readjustment. 
Simplicity. — A corollary of the idea of adaptability 
is that of simplicity. In general, the experience of all 
persons engaged: in coéperative enterprises has em- 
phasized the fact that the less machinery there is, the 
better. In political government we have been growing 
away from the practice of electing some one to elect 
some one else to do something or to see that it is done. 
In school administration the general result of too 
much machinery is too little work. Even in voluntary 
organizations it is generally the case that the fewer 
officers and committees the better will be the work. 
Children are likely to have the idea that too often takes 
possession of adults, — that the bigger and more com- 
plicated the machine, the greater and better will be 
the results. The natural outcome of this may be a 
form of organization, wonderful because of its com- 
plex grotesqueness, — wheels within wheels, committees 
beyond number, officers and assistants for every 
imaginable activity. 
I once knew an organization of young people which 
had so many committees that there were hardly mem- 
bers enough to go around; and the reader has probably
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 The Socialized Recitation 
had experience with the same phenomenon. Yet the 
way to effectiveness -of organization is through simplic- 
ity. Structure should be based upon actual needs in 
the way of work that needs to be done; and it is poor 
policy to arrange for committees or officers who really 
have nothing to do, merely with the idea that holding 
office will give some sense of responsibility and that 
perhaps those who are chosen will of themselves find 
something to do. 
Spontaneity.— Whatever the nature and amount 
of administrative machinery, it should emphasize 
the idea of spontaneity. Activities, instead of being 
somewhat compulsory, as in the usual form of the 
recitation, or instead of being the perfunctory per- 
formance of a duty devolving on a cog in the adminis- 
trative machine, should be as free as possible. Where 
the socialized recitation proceeds as if everything 
were cut and dried, it is no better than any other 
formalized recitation procedure. 
It must be made emphatic that spontaneity does not 
mean_aimlessness, lack of control, doing work on the 
spur_of the moment, or confusion. Unfortunately 
this fact has been sufficiently overlooked to cause the 
skeptical to feel that when a class is “ socialized ” 
the fact may be recognized by the aimlessness, noise, 
and confusion that characterize its activities. The 
essence of true spontaneity in class work is none of the 
defects just mentioned ; it is rather a feeling of freedom 
to make contribution. tothe—progress of the class,

    the duty.) It means freedom 
from repression on the one hand, freedom from com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
How to Organize Socialized Recitation 27 
pulsion on the other, — both interpreted in a relative 
rather than in an absolute sense. 
Opportunity for Codperation.— As mutual help is 
one of the essentials in the process of socialization, it 
follows that the form of organization chosen should 
give great place to the idea of codperation. Indeed 
the purpose of organization is to make codperation 
possible; although the idea sometimes obtains that 
the sole purpose is to save labor. Any scheme of 
organization which substitutes the activity of a few 
(chairman, committee, or teacher) for the codperative 
activity of the group is bound to fail as an instrument 
of socialization. 
If the principle of codéperation is interpreted as 
applying to the whole group, as indeed it should apply, 
it follows that every pupil should be given his fair 
chance to work, to develop, to express his views, to lead, 
to follow, to approve, to criticize, to help in determining 
policies. The normal tendency will be in school just 
what it is outside: a few of the more enthusiastic, 
energetic, conscientious, or talkative persons will tend 
to monopolize the class period. Unless the form of 
organization reduces this to a minimum, a large number 
of pupils might better be in a class which follows the 
usual routine; for they would then be more likely 
to engage in profitable activities. 
It becomes obvious in practice that there is a con- 
tradiction between the principle of spontaneous action 
and that of adequate participation by every member 
of the class. This is due to an inconsistency in human 
nature: the more the individual needs activity for his 
development, the less likely he is to seek that activity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
28 The Socialized Recitation 
However, as the school is not engaged in the process of 
letting nature take her course, but rather in a work of 
supplementing and modifying natural endowment, 
it is to be expected that the process of education will 
make particular provision for those who are likely to 
lose their birthright to development-bringing activities 
on account of their diffidence, laziness, or lack of zeal. 
Consequently the socialized recitation, characterized 
as it is by great freedom on the part of pupils, must 
be so organized as to overcome the very natural 
tendency for spontaneity to lead to an intellectual 
monopoly in the possession of a few energetic or 
talkative pupils. 
Place of the Teacher. — The place of the teacher in 
the administration of the socialized recitation calls 
for most careful consideration. “At the one extreme 
is the practice of making the teacher an outsider, a 
mere spectator; at the other is the situation in the 
ordinary school procedure, the teacher being an 
autocrat who determines and controls practically 
everything. In actual practice it is necessary to pro- 
ceed more or less slowly from the condition which is 
characteristic of most schools toward a more rational 
conception of the place and function of the teacher. 
So far as the actual machinery is concerned, the 
teacher may very well be left out, —not being mentioned 
at all as officer or member of a committee. Actually, 
however, the teacher cannot be left out. Indeed the 
indirect control exerted by the teacher through sug- 
gestion of ideas is perhaps the crucial matter in the 
success or failure of the socialized recitation. The 
organization, however, must make it obvious to the
-P-A-G-E-39
How to Organize Socialized Recitation 29 
pupils that the work of the class is theirs, the re- 
sponsibility for success is theirs, the benefit of success 
is theirs. The teacher will then become a more 
effective but less noticeable force. 
Forms of Organization. — In the actual application 
of the idea of the socialized recitation several forms 
of organization have been used. These range from 
the practically unorganized group to the imitation of 
some complex phase of governmental organization 
such as senate or city council. For the purpose of 
convenience we may distinguish three levels of organiza- 
tion: first, the codperative group in which each par- 
ticipates as he will, little or no conscious division of 
labor or choice of leaders or servants being noticeable ; 
second, the group organized in imitation of some insti- 
tution found in the world outside the school; third, 
the formation of a type of codperative society designed 
to meet the needs of the occasion, without conscious 
imitation of any form of organization in school or out. 
The first of these forms demands comparatively 
little of the pupils and may be put into operation so 
easily and gradually as to make transition from the 
ordinary teacher-pupil type of class work hardly notice- 
able. The last. demands a high degree of interest, 
zeal, and intelligence on the part of the pupils. Be- 
tween the two extremes there may be practically all 
degrees of development. On the lowest level we may 
find children just beginning to rise above selfish in- 
dividualism ; on the highest we a conscious practice 
of social oaeals. 
The Informal Group. — When the class is small it is 
frequently possible to weld the members into a true
-P-A-G-E-40
  30 The Socialized Recitation 
social group through the introduction of such forms of 
activity as will demand coéperation instead of the 
usual type of strictly individual achievement. Such 
forms of activity are possible all the way from kinder- 
garten to university. In the lower grades, where 
the mastery of fundamental processes is of great 
importance, pupils may learn to work together to 
secure that practice which is essential in attaining the 
speed and accuracy necessary. 
Number games, spelling drill, oral reading, in fact any 
kind of drill work may be carried on coéperatively, that 
is, through mutual helpfulness in using correct forms, 
eliminating mistakes, and securing speed. Even the 
deadly oral reading lesson in which each pupil reads 
what everybody else knows and nobody wishes to 
hear may be transformed by making the group a little 
coéperative body in which each pupil can contribute 
to others through reading aloud. 
To illustrate, we may take drill in addition. Combi- 
nation cards may be distributed ; after which each pupil 
may display his card, call upon anyone he will, and 
have the correctness of the result checked by the 
whole group. The pupil who is called upon then 
repeats the process. The teacher remains in the back- 
ground and sees that no errors go unchecked and that 
no pupil is neglected. A variation may be introduced 
by having each pupil make a problem in addition and 
call upon some member of the group to give the sum, 
the accuracy of the response being checked by the 
‘group just as is the case when number cards are used. 
In oral reading or story telling, the class may become 
in imagination a family group, Canterbury Pilgrims,
-P-A-G-E-41
  How to Organize Socialized Recitation 31 
mariners shipwrecked upon a desert island, or any 
sort of group who may be entertained by the art of the 
reader or story teller. Each pupil may then make his 
contribution to the general good by reading aloud or 
telling something which he thinks will entertain the 
others. He will then have a real reason for reading 
aloud or for story telling; and social pressure will tend 
to make him try to do his best to give pleasure to 
others. If it seems necessary to introduce drill for 
any purpose, the plan suggested for arithmetic drill 
may be adapted to the needs of the reading lesson. 
In such work as this, if there is to be a real socializa- 
tion and not merely a formal imitation, there must be 
a feeling of friendliness, a desire to be helpful to others, 
operation of the group stimulus, and a feeling that-it 
is the group as well as the individual that is making 
progress. Having one pupil call upon another and 
passing the privilege around to all the members of the 
class is a mere detail of technique. It is not the form 
but the spirit that animates which counts. a 
. The Institutionalized Group. — Pupils in the upper 
grades and in high school are frequently attracted by 
the idea of conducting class activities as a phase of 
the work of some institution of importance in the 
lives of adult citizens, — the city council, the senate 
or house of representatives, a court, a dramatic club, 
a literary society, and a business house being good 
examples of the possibilities. When the members 
of a class decide to imitate the activities of some social 
institution, the plan of procedure is relatively simple, 
involving as it does only a study of how to organize 
and operate that which is already in existence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 The Socialized Recitation 
Suppose that the members of a class in community 
civics are taken with the idea of organizing a city 
council for the purpose of carrying on their study more 
effectively. The first thing to be done is to get a 
clear understanding of the nature of the organization 
which is to be imitated. The next step is to choose 
various members of the class to fill the necessary 
official positions. Then comes the difficult task of 
operating the machinery. The introduction of mea- 
sures that need attention, study of essential details, 
debate in regard to policies of administration, and 
conforming to the plan of the imitated organization 
while actually carrying on systematic school work— 
all make a difficult but attractive problem. The 
working of committees, the investigations of experts, 
the consideration of needs, methods of prozedure, 
possible limits of achievement, mastery of details 
by all members of the council, and voting upon pro- 
posed plans give a setting of great possibilities. 
The fact that a piece of social machinery is to be 
created means that in the process of organization the 
teacher has a great responsibility in the matter of 
making clear the consequences of organization and 
the need of officers who can do their work effectively. 
Any tendency to think that the “ council’ will run 
itself without intelligent effort on the part of all its 
members must be removed. Back of the whole effort 
there must be a social spirit which will exert its pressure 
upon all the members of the group but particularly 
upon those who have the added responsibility of official 
position. 
In addition to this social pressure there must be
-P-A-G-E-43
How to Organize Socialized Recitation 33 
study by the pupils that they may understand what is 
essential in the performance of their duties as members 
of a council or as its officers. Furthermore the teacher 
must continually give attention to the training of pu- 
pils to render service to the group. A good presiding 
officer is not to be picked up at random in every class. 
Even if it were possible to find a good pupil leader, it 
would not be good policy to give this child a monopoly 
of the development that comes from such position of 
leadership. For the teacher the work of organization 
is continuous, interpreted in the sense of training 
pupils to serve in varying capacities. For the pupils 
a similar condition should be true, — participation in 
different phases of group activity rather than falling 
into the groove of action in a single capacity only. 
No one should always be presiding officer; no one 
should always be secretary; not even the most timid 
should be permitted to remain continually in the back- 
ground unseen and unheard. Organization ought to 
be a matter of such frequent readjustment as to give 
great opportunity for participation in different capa- 
cities; but the extreme of shifting so frequently as 
to give no one a chance to progress well toward mastery 
should be carefully avoided. 
What has been said concerning the imitation of a 
city council may be applied to practically any other 
form of organization which is taken over from the 
life of adults. There are certain steps which must 
inevitably be taken: creation of a group desire to 
codperate in the enterprise, study of the organization 
suggested, choice of officers, continual exertion of 
social pressure to secure efficiency, training of members 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
    34 The Socialized Recitation 
and especially officers through study of situations as 
they arise and through practice in carrying out plans, 
shifting of officers, and continual training of members 
in new duties. In outward form the organization will 
be like the institution imitated; in its inner working 
and spirit it will be chiefly an educational device, 
varying from day to day to meet the needs of training 
different pupils for new tasks. 
The Self-directing Group. — As in government the 
highest form of evolution is the self-determining, self- 
directing democracy, so in the process of socializing 
through the recitation the highest stage is reached 
when pupils rise to that level where they study their 
own needs, plan suitable forms of organization, and 
put their plans into successful operation. It is a level 
that is to be reached only through hard work, frequent 
failure, steadfastness of purpose, and great zeal, — 
all supported by a sympathetic and understanding 
teacher. 
It is not to be expected that a satisfactory form of 
organization will be hit upon at the very first trial. 
If intelligent adults, experienced in politics, were 
unable to devise a federation of American states 
without transition from Articles of Confederation to 
a new constitution and without frequent modification 
of that constitution through court decision, civil war, 
and amendment, it hardly seems reasonable to expect 
children to make a perfect success of any plan of 
organization which they devise to meet what they 
consider their needs. Consequently it is to be expected 
that organization upon the plane here considered 
will undergo frequent adjustments as new conditions
-P-A-G-E-45
  How to Organize Socialized Recitation 35 
arise and as understanding is increased through 
experience and study. 
The problem of supreme importance is that of 
devising a kind of organization which will insure 
steadfast progress toward the desired goal. In trying 
to solve this problem the pupils will be confronted 
with a dilemma which resembles that of nations: a 
very high degree of centralization (practically autoc- 
racy) is likely to insure’steadfastness and consistency ; 
while a thoroughly decentralized organization is likely 
to be unstable and inconsistent. The former secures 
unification of effort at the price of dictatorship; while 
the latter may have to pay the penalty of inefficiency 
for the sake of democracy. ‘To find a way out of this 
dilemma is the permanent problem of democratic 
peoples. 
It is also the problem of the group of pupils who are 
consciously striving to work out forms of organization 
which will meet their needs. In ordinary class pro- 
cedure the dictator is provided — the teacher. In the 
self-determining group it is necessary to find some 
substitute for this dictatorship. The first natural 
tendency is to try to have the direction of events 
governed by the whole class. Unless conditions are 
very exceptional this attempted solution will merely 
reveal the fact that such a form of direction is wasteful 
of time and energy ; that it has a tendency to produce 
friction; that it leads to much talk and little accom- 
plishment; that it may operate successfully on this 
occasion or that, but that it does not adapt itself to 
that consistent course of action which is necessary to 
progress.
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 The Socialized Recitation 
It consequently becomes clear that it is necessary 
to substitute a definite directive force for the random 
discussions and conclusions of the entire group. The 
needs of the class may be served by a director or 
president or by an executive committee. Under the 
guidance of the teacher through question and sugges- 
tion the class will gradually progress toward the idea 
of efficient accomplishment through delegated powers 
in the hands of responsible officers. The president 
or the executive committee must understand the obliga- 
tion to go ahead, to plan, to direct; but must also 
appreciate the fact that ultimate control is a prerogative 
of the entire group. 
The remainder of the group must appreciate the 
duty of codperating, of judging plans, and of con- 
tributing ideas to modify the policies of the directing 
officer or committee. If at any time there appears a 
gulf between the plans of the directing officers and the 
activities of the class the process of socialization is at 
a standstill and readjustment is necessary. The prob- 
lem of adapting the plans for progress to the wishes 
of the group must be attacked anew; and it may 
be necessary to attack the old dilemma of autoc- 
racy and democracy, of efficiency and poorly directed 
activity. 
‘A second problem that demands some kind of 
organization or system is that of securing equalization 
of opportunity to engage in profitable activities; or 
from another point of view it is the problem of making 
proper distribution of work so that none will sink into 
idleness or slackness while others are overburdened. 
In a small group of energetic and enthusiastic pupils
-P-A-G-E-47
  How to Organize Socialized Recitation 37 
this is really so very insignificant a problem that the 
volunteer system may operate successfully. If friction 
arises because of inability to secure proper division of 
work (too many pupils insisting on doing the same 
thing) it may become necessary to devise some form of 
organization to remedy the evil. 
A similar need is certain to arise in a large group 
regardless of willingness to codperate. The pupils 
have then the problem of devising a plan which will 
result in equitable division of labor. As in the case 
of the first problem (that of insuring steadfast progress 
toward the desired goal), this question of equalizing 
opportunity or dividing work leads to placing respon- 
sibility in the hands of an individual or small committee. 
In the solution of both the foregoing problems, a 
peculiar tendency is likely to arise. It is that of making 
the directing officer or committee a substitute for the 
teacher. It is obvious that such an officer or committee 
must really represent the group if real socialization 
is to take place. It is not merely having a leader that 
is important—the teacher would suffice. It is 
developing responsible leadership and codperation 
that socializes. 
As the work progresses a third problem may arise. 
It is likely to become evident that matters are being 
left at loose ends, that what is contributed by any 
individual for the benefit of the group is not really 
gained by the group. This condition is especially 
likely to arise when the subject matter handled is 
history, community civics, and the like. To bring 
the loose ends together it may seem good to choose 
a member of the class to act as summarizer. It will 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
38 The Socialized Recitation 
be his duty to organize the materials presented and 
assist his fellow students to grasp the parts in their 
relationships to one another and to the whole problem 
or topic. As this is a kind of work that demands a 
high degree of skill it is likely to be quite difficult to 
train even the very good pupils to render the service 
successfully. 
In the beginning it is usually better to permit the 
duties of summarizer to remain with a single individual 
for some little time. so that he may develop and also 
that the idea may develop among the other members of 
the class. It is poor policy in the long run to make it 
seem that a single member of the class is responsible 
for the systematic organization of materials presented 
to the class. It is possible after considerable training 
to reach a stage where the choosing of a summarizer 
may be left until all the contributions have been made. 
By this method responsibility for summarizing and 
organizing is placed upon every member of the class. 
Somewhat similar to the work of summarizing is 
that of checking up or judging. While it is obvious 
that the teacher must continually be a critic and 
guide, it is true that the process of socialization has 
not reached its highest stage as long as the members 
of the group have not become conscious of the need 
- of judging their own efforts or of dividing their labor in 
such a way as to make such criticism the function of 
some member of the group. This process of judging 
has two aspects: in the first place, it is directed to the 
contributions of individuals; in the second, it has 
to do with the accomplishment of the group itself. 
For the first of these functions it may be necessary to
-P-A-G-E-49
  
How to Organize Socialized Recitation 39 
have no modification of organization, the matter of 
criticism being left to the voluntary participation of 
individuals as occasion arises, that is, as they discover 
mistakes, defects, and inconsistencies in materials as 
they are presented. 
Judging the group as a whole is a more difficult 
matter. Before any adjustment of organization is 
made, the problem must be clearly seen by the group 
and the need appreciated. Then two courses are pos- 
sible. The group may decide to employ an expert 
from outside — probably the teacher; or they may 
think it better to select a fellow member or a com- 
mittee. Organization thus follows the recognition of 
function. In either case the guidance of the teacher is 
particularly necessary because of the fact that the 
attention of the pupils will be directed more to the 
actual accomplishment of the work at hand than to the 
judging of class activities. Children, like adults, are 
likely to be so absorbed in mere doing that they do 
not rise to the level of judging the worth or success of 
their efforts. 
Finally, the operation of the group may lead to such a 
degree of seriousness that there will be a demand for 
some adequate measurement of achievement. In a 
crude way this need may be met by having members 
give their opinion in regard to their own progress: and 
that of the group. In reality, this can hardly be sat- 
isfactory even though the pupils themselves enumerate 
various details of improvement and achievement. If 
possible the teacher should stimulate the group to 
desire to have a more adequate measurement made. 
This means calling in an expert. Where they are
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 The Socialized Recitation 
available, standard tests or scales should be used in 
order that comparisons may be made with other 
groups. Where such tests and scales are not to be 
had, the class may be satisfied with tests made by the 
teacher or principal. : 
The essential thing, however, is that the pupils 
rise to that consciousness of need for measurement of 
progress which will lead them to demand testing by 
someone outside the group who is capable of rendering 
a judgment based upon discovered facts rather than 
mere opinion. A group which has gained the idea of 
making use of expert service has reached a stage of 
socialization which makes it worthy of emulation by 
the large community outside the school. 
In some groups it may seem desirable to have a record 
of proceedings kept for future reference. This may 
take the form of a set of minutes showing assignments 
of work, reports, and other activities; or it may be 
more after the order of a record of the progress of the 
group considered as such. In the former case the 
class will need a secretary; in the latter, a historian. 
Neither is essential in every group ; but either may seem 
of sufficient importance to lead to adapting the organ- 
ization to the idea. 
In French schools it is quite generally the custom 
to keep a kind of class record book showing the ac- 
tivities from day to day,—the pupils taking turns 
in filling in the items. Although the purpose of this 
work is to provide definite material for the eyes of 
the inspector, the idea might be taken over and made 
part of the work of the socialized class. When divested 
of the feeling that the purpose concerns an outsider, it
-P-A-G-E-51
  How to Organize Socialized Recitation 41 
might serve to spur the members of the class to a kind of 
codperative effort which would make the mastery of 
details more certain. It would at least serve to remove 
the uncertainty and disagreement that sometimes arise 
concerning what the class is really supposed to have 
accomplished.

  CHAPTER IV 
ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS 
In this chapter will ‘be given two stenographic 
reports of lessons in which the socialized method of 
procedure was used. Nothing has been done to make 
them other than they actually were. All mistakes in 
matters of fact, all crudities of speech, and all evidences 
of lack of complete socialization have been retained 
just as they were taken down by the stenographer. 
This procedure will have a tendency to make the 
defects of the work stand out too prominently; but 
to overcome that condition there is given first a sten- 
ographic report of a lesson conducted by the usual 
method of question and answer. By comparing this 
lesson with the others the reader will be able to discover 
many contrasts that are not altogether unfavorable 
to the socialized method.

REPORT OF A LESSON CONDUCTED IN THE USUAL 
MANNER! 
(This lesson was not selected because it was par- 
ticularly bad; indeed it is probably better than the 
average. The pupils were alert and attentive. The

ical Outlook of May, 1920, and are reproduced here through

teacher was more vigorous, more»interested in the 
work, and more zealous for the progress of the pupils 
than is the usual case. The ordinary observer would 
-have come away from this class with the feeling that 
he had seen a very good teacher and at least a fair 
class. The reason for this probably lies in the fact 
that the whole recitation moved along rapidly and 
with only slight breaks even when pupils were found 
to be deficient in preparation. In studying this lesson, 
note especially the amount of talking done by the 
teacher in comparison with that done by the pupils.) 
Topic. Emigration to America. 
Class. Eighth Grade. 
Book. Bagley and Beard, A History of the American 
People. 
Teacher. To-day our lesson discusses emigration to 
America. Can you tell me something about that in regard 
to land, ete., Clarence? 
Pupil. Don’t know anything about that. 
T. Don’t know anything about that, and it is the first 
thing in our lesson? 
P. Made land more valuable. 
T. Anything to add, Louis? 
P. They had heard stories about gold and silver, and they 
were afgaid their children would be kidnapped. 
P. They told tales of wonderful riches, gold chains and 
silver, ornaments of gold and silver, and wonderful things 
they could find, so they started to emigrate fast. They 
found many things to be untrue, so many others did not 
come. They advertised in the papers, sent hand bills, some 
ship owners tried to get rich. They charged three hundred 
to five hundred dollars for each passenger. They made 
offices at the ports. They tried to make people go. They 
would show a few things at port which they hadfound. They 
said there was plenty of land.
-P-A-G-E-55
Tllustrative Lessons 45 
P. Afterwards they didn’t believe the stories about the 
gold, and they came to get land. 
T. How about to-day? Do real estate agents use the 
same practices? Did you ever read one of their ads in the 
paper about land? How they make it sound one thing, when 
it is not really true? How much did it cost to make the trip? 
P. About two or three hundred dollars. 
All. Aw — Three to five hundred. 
T. Tell about religious causes. What about the Puri- 
tans? How about the different denominations or religions? 
Tell about their character and life. 
P. When they came over here, they had to go to church, 
they were punished if they didn’t, their hands and feet were 
tied, the boys were whipped, they had to think of death and 
go to church regular, and they thought it was wicked to go 
to see a show. 
T. Where did they settle? 
P. Massachusetts. 
T. Show me on the map where Massachusetts is. (Pupil 
shows on map location of Massachusetts.) Yes. 
T. Do you remember some descendants of these people? 
The names of any prominent persons? 
P. Some writers and historians, Longfellow, Bryant. 
Don’t remember any others. 
T. We will come to some of them later, Henry Wads- 
worth Longfellow, John Adams, John Hancock, who took 
part in the Revolution. What about the Quakers? what 
kind of people were they, and who were they? 
P. They came with Penn and didn’t they settle in 
Massachusetts? (Pause.) 
T. Go ahead. 
P. They came over here to have their own church. 
T. Where did they settle? 
P. In Pennsylvania. They were more tolerant than 
others. 
T. Yes, they were more tolerant, they permitted more 
participation in government. Do you remember the book 
said something about the Dunkards? Who remembers
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 The Socialized Recitation 
what the book said about the Dunkards? (Pause.) Didn’t 
anybody look that up? (Pause.) They were a sect who 
came over from Germany. There were Lutherans also 
and the Baptists in Pennsylvania. How about the Presby- 
terians in Scotland and Ireland? 
P. Some of these religious people came from Ireland to 
New York, but stayed there; later the Scots came to Ireland 
and then there was religious feeling against the two religions. 
T. Anything to add to the Scotch-Irish? 
P. InTreland a general there was very cruel and drove the 
Scots out of Ireland. In this way the Scots settled where they 
were driven out and came to America. 
T. What famous general was that? 
P. Cromwell. 
T. Yes, Cromwell. He was the leader of the Puritans in 
England. When the Puritans became the leaders, Cromwell 
led a faction against the Royalists or Cavaliers. The land they 
held was turned over to the Scotch immigrants. They emi- 
grated about 1650. Later the English government was almost 
as severe to them as they had been to the Catholics and they left 
England and settled in Scotland and Pennsylvania in order to 
have place to worship. The book said about one sixth at the 
outbreak of Revolution were of Scotch-Irish descent. 
P. A bunch of people went to England and settled there 
but were crowded out. 
T. Anything else about the Scotch-Irish? In Ireland 
to-day the Scotch Presbyterian element in the north has 
caused trouble of Home Rule. Tell me something of the 
Catholies in America. 
P. Don’t know anything about that. 
T. Who was leader? 
P. Lord Baltimore. 
T. Tell me about him. 
P. Well, all I know is that the King gave him land in 
America. 
P. He went there and called it Maryland. It did not 
have any religion but were mostly Catholics. He laid out 
the city of Baltimore.
-P-A-G-E-57
  Tllustrative Lessons 47 
T. Show me the city of Baltimore on the map. What 
famous provision did Lord Baltimore make in regard to 
religion? 
P. Anyone who believed in Christ could live there. 
T. Who was excluded? 
P. Jews. 
T. Yes, the Jews. The book mentioned the Royalists 
or Cavaliers. Who were they? 
P. They were proprietors who owned tracts of land and 
got people to settle on them. 
T. Who were the Cavaliers? 
P. They were supporters of the King when Cromwell 
drove the King out and beheaded him. They came to 
America and settled in Virginia. They feared the King. 
T. Yes, they feared the King and they came to America 
and settled in Virginia. What famous Cavalier came over 
here? 
P. George Washington’s ancestors. 
T. The really noble class of English were the Cavaliers. 
Another cause of emigration was poverty. Tell me some- 
thing about that. 
P. The better class in America (stenographer’s notes de- 
fective) bond servants get land, start anew and have more 
chance. 
T. Do you remember about how many came over for 
religion or poverty? 
P. More came over on account of poverty than religion. 
T. General cause or reason, don’t you think? How 
about to-day? Do people come here because of their religion 
or to better their condition? Many came from religious 
principles. Thrown in prison for minor things the burden was 
on the poor. The peasants had a hard time. What about 
kidnapping of people, etc.? 
P. They kidnapped people of the poorer class and sold 
them as slaves, they had to work barefoot, they had no 
clothes, and not anything to eat. They kidnapped them 
on the streets at night. 
P. They lay for them at night. They had to work like
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 The Socialized Recitation 
slaves, both the women and children had to work as hard as 
men, and they had no shelter. 
T. Itsaid in the book they carried off about 10,000 a year. 
Yes, about 10,000 in one year. Anything else? 
P. Men, women, boys and girls of all ages were kid- 
napped. 
T. Yes, men, women were kidnapped, and some were sold 
to landowners. The men were bound out as servants. We'll 
read about it later. Did you notice anything in the book 
about the Mennonites? Didn’t anyone find anything? 
You have seen some of them around Iowa City, very plain 
people wearing a strange dress and hood. 
P. Amish? 
T. Yes, Amish or Mennonites. Now for to-morrow, 
we'll take a shorter lesson than usual, I’ll return your papers, 
and you look them over and correct them, so you will not have 
such a long lesson in the book. To-day we took to bond serv- 
ants, find out about their life, how they were treated, and 
low they became free. Take to the top of page 78 where 
it says the French explore the Mississippi. Most of this will 
be review, only three pages in advance. Any questions?

A LESSON BY A SOCIALIZED CLASS IN HISTORY 
Class. Eleventh Grade. University (of Iowa) High 
School. 
Topic. The Articles of Confederation and the Con- 
stitutional Convention. 
Material. Various reference works. See assignment 
at close of this lesson. 
Teacher. Miss Bessie L. Pierce. 
(In studying this report, note the following details: 
1. The pupils do most of the talking ; 
2. The reports show variability in reading, adapted 
to the capacity and interests of the pupils; 
   
-P-A-G-E-59
  Tilustrative Lessons 49 
3. There is nothing to keep the brightest pupil from 
working up to his capacity; nothing to prevent even 
the dullest from making a reasonable contribution to 
the work of the class ; 
4, The teacher remains in the background, although 
she is alertly directing proceedings and participates 
whenever it seems necessary ; 
5. The pupils evidently feel as much responsibility 
for the correction of mistakes as the teacher ; 
6. The pupils have the ability to rise from the level 
of studying a single text to that of handling materials 
in standard works on the subject.) : 
Teacher. We will take up our work now. 
Marshall. To-day we are taking up the Articles of Con- 
federation and the Constitutional Convention. 
The Articles of Confederation were the first form of gov- 
ernment after the Civil War. They were not strict enough. 
They did not have power over individuals nor did the govern- 
ment have power to collect taxes. It could ask for things 
put could not enforce its wishes. Before the Articles of Con- 
federation were ratified the states were fighting for their 
rights to the public lands which they held under their charters. 
Maryland asked all the states to withdraw their claims. New 
York, then Massachusetts, then the other states having 
claims withdrew, so that a form of government might be 
established. 
This form of government lasted for eight years. The 
power was in control of a Congress. There were a group of 
delegates from each state, from two to seven in number. 
The states had trouble between themselves and each state 
was entitled to one vote. This enmity between the states 
had been carried over from the British Colonies, when there 
was so much jealousy. During this time Great Britain re- 
fused to conclude a commercial treaty though trade went on 
between the two countries. The fact that the thirteen states
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 The Socialized Recitation 
could do about as they pleased without reference to the re 
government did not get respect for us. 
When the United States, in order to get a ooitinertial 
treaty with Spain which would allow United States ships to 
trade in Spanish ports, proposed to give up her claim to the 
free navigation of the mouth of the Mississippi,? Kentucky was 
very angry and threatened to secede and Congress gave up 
the proposed treaty. The western counties of North Carolina 
asked admission to the Union under an independent state 
of Franklin. There were revolts also in Rhode Island and 
Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, Shays’s Rebellion took 
place because paper money was not allowed to be issued 
and the people wished it and so grew violent. 
} Cornelia. He said Civil War instead of Revolutionary 
War. He didn’t start quite at the beginning. Even before 
the Articles of Confederation, the states organized. Some 
of the states kept their old charters like Connecticut and 
Rhode Island, and substituted ‘‘the people”? for ‘ the 
king.” All kept the colonial governor and legislature in 
which nearly always there were two houses. 
The Articles of Confederation provided a centralized form 
of government. States sent their delegates to a Congress 
of one house. The states told them how to vote. The 
government chose state courts to try cases of felony and 
piracy on the high seas. Nor did the government have power 
to raise money for their debt, — this is a deficiency of the 
government. 
Teacher. Mamie. 
Mamie. People stood the Articles of Confederation for 
a while, but in 1785 Maryland and Virginia met at Mt. Vernon 
to decide about the navigation of the Potomac. They real- 
ized that it was necessary for more states to get together, 
so Virginia invited all to come next year to Annapolis, 
Maryland, to consider a commercial policy for the nation. 
Five states came and Alexander Hamilton suggested that a 
convention assemble at Philadelphia in 1887 to consider 
the needs of making a government that could accomplish 
things. 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  Illustrative Lessons 51 
Teacher. What was the time then of the meeting of the 
Constitutional Convention? 
Mamie. 1887. 
Philip. 1787. 
Teacher. Ruth. 
Ruth. Hamilton proposed a plan based on the theory 
that the British government was the best in the world. 
Teacher. What about the Senate in Hamilton’s plan? 
Constance. The Senate was to serve for life. 
Philip. It compared to the House of Lords in England. 
The chief executive was also to be chosen for life. The 
Senate was to name state governors and could unseat them. 
Teacher. The power of the central government to dismiss 
state governors from office indicated what? 
Marshall. That Hamilton was hoping for a strongly cen- 
tralized government, with little power for the states. 
Ruth. Washington was the presiding officer at the con- 
vention. Another plan than Hamilton’s was the Virginia 
plan. It proposed two houses in the legislature, the House 
of Representatives being selected by the people and a Senate 
chosen by the House. There was also to be a judicial and 
also an executive department. John Adams, Washington, 
Pinckney, Ellsworth, and Franklin were some of the delegates. 
Teacher. That’s very well done, Ruth, but some one 
should have noticed a mistake. 
Pupil. Was her plan all right? 
Teacher. Yes. She had John Adams as a delegate when 
he was in Europe. Some one should have noticed that. 
Lucy. Another plan was called the New Jersey plan or 
Paterson’s plan. It was to amend the Articles of Confedera- — 
tion by allowing Congress to control commerce and to give 
Congress power to collect taxes. There were to be an execu- 
tive and a judicial department too. All states were to have 
the same number of delegates. 
Wallace. None of the plans were accepted. They had 
to compromise. 
Teacher. Give the compromises, 
Wallace. I can’t.
-P-A-G-E-62
    52 The Socialized Recitation 
Teacher. Very well, then, Guy. 
Guy. There were to be two houses in the legislative divi- 
sion. One house was to have two from each state; the other 
according to population. In making up the population 
three fifths of the negroes were to count. This was for the 
South. An electoral college was to select the president, who 
was to be commander in chief of the army and navy. We 
also have a vice-president who takes the president’s place 
if he can’t serve. Congress can levy taxes, grant copyrights 
and do such things. 
Thomas. Another compromise said that Congress could 
levy a tax not to exceed ten dollars a head on slaves imported 
and could not stop the slave trade till 1808. No duties were 
to be levied on exports. 
Teacher. In what ways can you notice a difference in the 
form of government under the Constitution and under the 
Articles of Confederation, Melva? 
Melva. I don’t know. 
Pupil. The government was more centralized than under 
the Articles. 
Teacher. What about the legislative branch? 
Ella. It had two houses. 
Teacher. What form is it called? 
Bicameral. Don’t forget the word. B-i-c-a-m-e-r-a-l. 
What is the advantage of two houses in the legislature? 
Marshall. It takes longer to put things through. One 
house can’t pass crazy things without the other letting it. 
Ford. Under the Articles of Confederation there really 
was no executive. We have a president now. Individuals 
can be made to do things now, but they couldn’t under the 
Articles. The Articles did not provide for a third branch 
called the judiciary either. 
Teacher. Very well. For to-morrow’s lesson, we shall 
consider how machinery was provided to run the new govern- 
ment established and how Washington helped in getting our 
government started. Find out about his fitness for his task, 
just what his tasks were, and how he met them. Among them 
you will notice, first, how to organize a government — the

ernment. Look up Hamilton’s financial measures. Use your 
texts and the following suggested outside readings : 
Bogart, Economic History ;

Thompson, History of United States ; 
and also refer to American Nation Series. ' 
Any questions?

A LESSON BY A SOCIALIZED CLASS IN 
GEOGRAPHY! 
Class. Sixth Grade, Speyer School of Teachers 
College, Golumbia University. 
Topic. The problem of discovering whether or not 
there is cotton manufacturing in any part of the 
United Kingdom except England. 
Material. Various reference works and_ school 
texts, indicated in the body of the report. 
(In considering this lesson, note that 
1. The teacher is the leader ; 
2. The pupils have carried on quite a wide search 
for materials ; 
3. There is great freedom in expressing ideas ; 
4. The lesson begins with a problem and ends with 
a summary which gives a definite statement of the 
solution ; 
5. The pupils are led to consider carefully all state- 
ments made by those making reports ; 
1This lesson is furnished through the courtesy of Dr. 
Ernest Horn of the State University of Iowa.

6. In spite of wide reading, the pupils stick to the 
main point with remarkable tenacity ; 
7. There is no evidence that the pupils study or 
recite merely to satisfy the teacher.) 
Teacher. What was the question we were to answer in 
our lesson to-day? 
Margaret. We want to find out is there any other cotton 
manufacturing done in any other part of the United Kingdom. 
-Teacher. Say that again, please. 
Margaret. We want to find out is there any other cotton 
manufacturing done in any other part of the United Kingdom. 
Teacher. Besides —? 
Margaret. England. 
Teacher. We will let Reginald tell us what he found out. 
Reginald. I only found out they only manufacture flax 
in Ireland and they don’t manufacture cotton, and they do 
all the manufacturing on the eastern side because that was 
where the coal was, and I thought they would have the coal 
on the same side England has it. 
Teacher. Does anyone want to ask Reginald a question? 
Parker. What has that got to do with it? If they don’t 
manufacture cotton, why talk about flax? Why don’t you 
say they don’t manufacture cotton and let it go at that? 
Marion. In Ireland they haven’t got enough coal. 
Teacher. Do you want to take side with the boys? Does 
anyone? 
Lillian. I think Reginald wasn’t talking to the point. 
We weren’t talking about flax. We were talking about 
cotton. 
Teacher. What do you think Reginald should have said? 
Lillian. I think he should have said they don’t manu- 
facture cotton in Ireland. 
Teacher. Now, what have you found out, Elly? 
Elly. I found they only manufacture flax. 
Teacher. Will you say that again? 
Elly. I didn’t find out somuch. TI only found what Regi- 
nald said — that Ireland only manufactured flax. 
   
-P-A-G-E-65
  Tilustrative Lessons 55 
Elsie. I found out the same thing, and Scotland, they 
manufacture cotton there. 
Parker. The city of Glasgow on the Clyde River is the 
largest cotton manufacturing city in Scotland, and I think 
there was over 4000 people engaged in the manufacture of 
cotton. 
Teacher. What do you want to prove by that? 
Parker. There is cotton manufacturing in Scotland. 
Teacher. Did any other people find the same thing? 
Then we will agree. What else did you find? Grace? 
Grace. That is what I found out about Scotland. 
Teacher. Stand up and tell about it. 
Grace. I found Scotland manufactured cotton and Ireland 
didn’t. 
Teacher. Did you find where in Scotland? 
Grace. In—TI don’t know how to say it. 
Teacher. There was a word you couldn’t handle. What 
should you have done? 
Grace. Looked it up. 
Teacher. Did you find it on the map? Where is it? 
Grace. In Scotland. 
Teacher. You are showing that you haven’t made much 
preparation for the lesson. Grace is talking about Dublin. 
She thinks it is in Scotland. 
Jessie. I thought they didn’t manufacture any cotton 
in Ireland and in Glasgow they just manufacture a little 
cotton. 
Hugh. I found that much cotton is manufactured in 
Glasgow and Paisley. In the latter a great amount is thread. 
That was from Winslow’s Europe, page 36. And in Car- 
penter’s Europe some of Scotch towns are in it for their cotton, 
and in Tarr and McMurry’s, page 343, I found Central Eng- 
land, including Scotland, is the center of cotton manufactur- 
ing. 
Teacher. Do you want to speak to Hugh? 
Donald. I thought it was western England. 
Hugh. I think it was. 
Teacher. In what part of England is manufacturing done?
-P-A-G-E-66
  
  56 The Socialized Recitation 
Hugh. In the western part. “ 
Cornelia. I want to speak to Hugh. I got that same 
point; but it says the central portion of Great Britain. The 
central portion of Great Britain including southern Scotland 
is the site of the greatest textile industry. 
Marion. If he said ‘“‘ England,” he shouldn’t say “ in- 
cluding Scotland.” 
Hugh. I said “including Scotland ” because England is 
one part of Great Britain. I should have said, ‘“ Central 
Great Britain” and I said, “‘ Central England including 
southern Scotland.” 
Teacher. You should have said —? 
Hugh. The central part of Great Britain. 
Teacher. I think some one might have said that Hugh 
made a nice recitation. He used three authorities. That 
was rather nice, I think, Hugh. Rose, can you tell anything? 
Rose. That’s all I found out. All I found out was that 
there was no manufacturing of cotton in Ireland. 
Teacher. Did you find that? 
Rose. No, I found flax was manufactured and I found in 
the southern part of Scotland cotton was manufactured. 
Teacher. Who else has something? 
Donald. I found out in Tarr & MeMurry, page 347, many 
millions of people are employed in manufacturing and other 
industries in the British Isles. They produce lots of cotton 
cloth. They import much wool and cotton from the United 
States. 
Teacher. What is your point? 
Donald. In the British Isles they manufacture these 
things. 
Teacher. And where are the British Isles? 
Donald. That’s what I would like to know. 
Lillian. England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. 
Cornelia. I have forgotten who said Glasgow didn’t 
manufacture much cotton; but I want to say I found in 
Carpenter’s, page 35, that shiploads of our cotton is sent to 
Glasgow to be made into cloth. I want to make the point 
there is a whole lot of cotton manufacturing.
-P-A-G-E-67
  Illustrative Lessons 57 
Teacher. Has anyone a fact he wants to give us on that 
topic? 
Reginald. It said in Tarr & MeMurry all over the 
British Isles cotton was manufactured. That would include 
Ireland. 
Teacher. What. did you say? 
Reginald. In Tarr & McMurry — I forget the page. 
Teacher. Are we going to attach much importance to a 
statement like that? When he finds an interesting fact, he 
should make note of the page. 
Wilda. Cornelia said she found out that Glasgow manu- 
factures a lot of cotton. I think they manufacture wool, 
but not cotton. 
Cornelia. It is on page 35 in Carpenter. 
Hugh. And in this book I get ‘‘ Much cotton is manu- 
factured in Glasgow.” 
Teacher. Now tell us what ‘‘ this book ” is. 
Hugh. This is Europe, by I. O. Winslow. 
Teacher. Has anyone else another point? 
Jack. I found right directly over the mountains between 
England and Scotland there is a lot of cotton. 
Teacher. What is there between England and Scotland? 
Jack. Mountains. 
Teacher. But if you go out of England you go into Scot- 
land. You are either in Scotland or England. 
Jack. As soon as you get into Scotland there is cotton. 
Margaret. Even if they were half in England and half 
in Scotland, they wouldn’t be in between them. 
Hugh. Much cotton is manufactured both in Glasgow and 
Paisley. A great amount of cotton thread is made in the 
latter city. 
Teacher. Now, what would you think would be the answer | 
to our question to-day? Is there much cotton manufactured 
outside of England? 
Marion. No. 
Teacher. Can you explain anything about it? 
Marion: In Ireland there is no cotton manufactured at 
all, and there is a lot in Scotland.  
-P-A-G-E-68
  
58 The Socialized Recitation 
Teacher. Then do you want to give the answer you gave? 
Now go back again. Is there cotton manufacturing in the 
United Kingdom outside of England? 
Marion. Yes, in Scotland. 
Teacher. Especially —? 
Marion. Especially in Glasgow. 
Teacher. Give the full statement. 
Marion. There is cotton manufacturing outside of Eng- 
land in Scotland, in the city of Glasgow. 
Teacher. Let me see what sources you used to-day. 
Besides Tarr & McMurry and Carpenter’s, four of the girls 
wanted Dodge’s Geography. Did you find anything in 
that? Hugh had his own authority, which he brought from 
home. There are other things we could have used. There 
is always the encyclopedia. We could have looked there. 
What topic would you have looked under? 
Rose. For ‘“‘ Cotton”? first. 
Teacher. Could you have looked in any other place 
besides ‘‘ Cotton ”’? 
Jack. In the “ British Isles ” or the “‘ United Kingdom.” 
Teacher. Or you could have looked under “ Great 
Britain.” Then don’t forget we have this school atlas by 
Bartholomew. This is an English atlas, so it is rather inter- 
esting. This yellow represents textiles. What do we mean 
by that? 
Elsie. Cloth. 
Teacher. What kind of cloth? 
Elsie. Linen, cotton, wool, and silk. 
Teacher. Yes. This yellow represents textile making. 
This represents England and this is a bit of Ireland here. 
Now, do you see any textile manufacturing in Ireland? 
Pupil. A little bit. 
Teacher. According to the report you gave, what textiles 
did you find? 
Pupil. Linen. 
Teacher. Now down where there are little dots in the 
yellow it means cotton. Plus signs mean wool; and these 
little x’s mean linen; and if there is a little square it means

silk. But when we look carefully over in Ireland, we find 
one place there are little dots showing cotton. Now tell us, 
Althea, using a full sentence. 
Althea. Which shows there is.a little cotton manufactur- 
ing in Ireland. 
Teacher. Then we found in the southern part of Scotland 
that there is cotton manufacturing. So what is the conclu- 
sion we must come to? 
Jack. That little cotton is manufactured in any other 
country in the United Kingdom except England. 
Teacher. Can anyone name them? 
Pupil. Scotland and Ireland and Wales. 
Teacher. And can you put in the word “ but”? 
Elly. But a good deal of it is manufactured in England. 
Teacher. Can you use stronger language? 
Margaret. Most of it. 
Teacher. Now, Margaret, would you like to make a full 
summary? 
Margaret. Most of the cotton manufacturing is done in 
England; but outside there is a little textile manufacturing. 
Teacher. Now that is a clear, nice summary. Who else 
can make one? . 
Jessie. Most of the cotton manufacturing is done in 
England. Some is done in the southern part of Scotland. 
Teacher. And what about Ireland? 
Jessie. Just a little bit. 
Teacher. Every time I must say part of it. Can some- 
one carry it through? 
Rose. There isn’t much cotton manufacturing in — 
there is a great deal of cotton manufacturing in England ; 
but there isn’t much cotton manufacturing outside except 
a little in Scotland. There isn’t much in Ireland or Wales. 
Parker. There is some cotton manufacturing outside of 
England in the United Kingdom. Most of it is done in the 
city of Glasgow, and just a little is done on the eastern side 
of Ireland. 
Teacher. Don’t you want to use a little conjunction — 
but?

Parker. But most of the cotton is manufactured in Eng- 
land. 
Teacher. Could he make it any more definite than just 
England? 
Althea. Near Manchester. 
Teacher. Can you make the complete statement now? 
Althea. There isn’t much cotton manufacturing done 
outside of the United Kingdom, except a little in Scotland 
and some in Ireland; but England manufactures most of the 
cotton, especially near Manchester. 
Teacher. Now, I think to-morrow, which will be Monday 
for us, we had better spend the class period getting a summary 
ready for our notebooks.

CHAPTER V 
DANGERS TO AVOID 
Every innovation in schoolroom practice is quite 
certain to be accompanied by a group of evils which 
threaten to nullify the improvement that is sought. 
The object lesson of Pestalozzi carried with it the 
continual possibility of giving more attention to words 
than to things and ideas. In fact, even in his own 
practice, the Swiss reformer frequently seemed to fall 
into a routine of word drill which obscured his funda- 
mental idea of Sense training. The use of projects 
in school work may result in more effort to satisfy 
the requirements for credit than to derive the educa- 
tional value involved. Or the intense desire to make 
a “success” of the work may lead to methods of 
accomplishment that are devious, if not to ways that 
are vain. 
In such matters the school is not different from the 
rest of the world, as we may see when we consider the 
dangers that accompany such innovations as the direct 
primary, the enlargement of the electorate, the com- 
munity center, the organization of the American 
Legion, or nation-wide campaigns to secure funds for 
philanthropic purposes. 
In this chapter certain dangers and evils will be 
pointed out with the idea of promoting the success 
61
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 The Socialized Recitation 
of the socialized recitation through the negative process 
of showing what not to do. 
Interest in Process Rather than in the Real Aim. — 
The idea of the socialized recitation is so attractive 
‘that there is some danger that the enthusiastic teacher 
may become more interested in the device itself than 
in the fundamental processes of class work — more 
interested in the machine than in the product.) He 
would be a foolish farmer who became so interested 
in the machinery of a thresher that he paid no attention 
to what went into the machine or what came out. He 
would be a ridiculous gardener who became so en- 
grossed in digging, raking, and fertilizing that he had 
no concern for what was planted in his garden. Yet 
neither would be more absurd than the teacher whose 
interest is more in the technique of the socialized 
recitation than in the essential educational results that 
are the reason for the existence of the school. Such 
a teacher would find a parallel only in a surgeon who 
is more interested in the operation than in the recovery 
of the patient. | 
Whatever the type of the socialized recitation may be, 
there must be no deviation from the fundamental 
requirements which society sets up for the school 
system as a whole, — that is, socialization through the 
content of studies pursued. What the pupil learns 
from the procedure of the socialized recitation is part 
of that content to be sure; but it is not a substitute for 
other subject matter. £ 
Counterfeit Socialization — Substituting Pupil for 
Teacher. — Although the socialized recitation means 
increased freedom and greater activity for the pupil,   
   
-P-A-G-E-73
Dangers to Avoid 63 
it seems obvious that these conditions are not to be 
gained merely by attempting to have some pupil 
chosen to act as teacher. Where the mistaken notion 
prevails that having a pupil occupy the teacher’s chair 
transforms the class into a socialized group, it is 
obvious that what really exists is only the usual form of 
recitation with an untrained, inexperienced person 
taking the place of one who is supposedly well trained 
and adequately prepared. In some circuinstances 
there may be some value in permitting a member of 
the class to conduct part of the work; but to have a 
pupil ask formal questions, to call upon members of 
the class, to follow the routine of the ordinary recitation, 
is taking no step in the direction of the socialized 
recitation. It is merely .to disguise the old form by 
putting a younger autocrat in the seat of authority. 
In the process of socializing the recitation there will 
be an enlargement of pupil leadership; but that 
leadership will be very different from the vested 
authority of the teacher, — whose legal powers make 
him practically an absolute monarch in the classroom. 
It will grow out of the ability and willingness to render 
some effective kind of service to the group in the pursuit 
of common purposes of worth. Any other kind of 
leadership will prove to be counterfeit. 
The Officious and Domineering Pupil.— In almost 
any group of human beings, however few in number, 
it is generally easy to discover some one person who 
’ is either officious or domineering. In the boys’ base- 
ball club, Johnny This or Jimmy That wants to be 
everything, do everything, control everything. In 
the ladies’ sewing circle Mrs. Someone or Miss Some-
-P-A-G-E-74
64 The Socialized Reaithition 
bodyelse attempts to assume a place of importance 
that is not altogether governed by her ability or even 
by the wishes of her fellow members. Even in the 
church, domination of policies and activities is some- 
times found in the hands of a single person or small 
group. One of the dangers of any form of socialized 
activity among children is that the evils and weaknesses 
that are found in the coéperative efforts of adults may 
destroy the educational value of the work attempted. 
™ Sometimes the attempt to monopolize! affairs is 
due less to the desire to magnify self than to a sincere 
wish to promote the welfare of the group together with 
a settled conviction that no one else can render service 
quite as valuable as the young egotist himself. The 
results are about the same as where self-interest rather 
than desire for group welfare is the cause: lack of 
harmony, bitterness of feeling, and loss of ability to 
work together. 
Shirking Individual Responsibility.—In contrast 
with the pupil who wishes to be all and do all there are 
those who are naturally slow, dull, diffident, or lazy. 
Because of this fact the socialized recitation is subject 
to a danger which has been mentioned as characteristic 
of the usual plan of conducting the recitation, — the 
neglect of a larger or smaller fraction of the class. 
While it is true that the operation of the process of 
socialization tends to promote equality of opportunity, 
to exert social pressure on the lazy, and to stimulate the 
diffident, it is likewise true that there is continual

Teachers College Record, Sept., 1919, pp. 328-331. 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
Dangers to Avoid 65 
danger that some members of the class will be able 
to hide in a dark corner just beyond the light of so- 
cialization. 
The dull pupil is likely to be discouraged by the 
peculiar smile that greets his efforts at participation ; 
the slow is likely to be left behind in the pursuit led 
_ by the more capable; the lazy may find frequent op- 
portunity to shift intellectual burdens to more willing 
shoulders. Thus one feels the force of the truth: 
“To-him that hath shall be given; but from him that 
hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” 
To counterbalance this normal tendency the group in 
process of socialization must learn to practice that demo- 
cratic ideal of giving to every one according to his need 
and demanding from every one according to his ability. 
Intellectual Rambling and Futile Discussion. — 
From the earliest days of the class method of recitation 
it has probably been the delight of the intellectual 
“sabeat ” to lead class and teacher into a time-con- 
suming discussion of irrelevant matters with the idea 
of limiting the amount of work required. Even among 
the conscientious it frequently happens that a tem- 
porary loss of the sense of values leads to futile discus- 
sion of topics, even important topics; or lively interest 
may lead to a rambling pursuit of some idea of little 
significance. Disagreement in regard to a fact of 
greater or less importance may bring about a five- 
minute discussion of something that may easily be 
settled in thirty seconds by an appeal to an authorita- 
tive reference work. Argument and counter-argument 
merely serve to arouse the feeling of rivalry instead of 
leading to a common-sense effort to discover the truth.
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 The Socialized Recitation 
The general tendency of the socialized recitation is 
to destroy the sentiment expressed by the pupil who 
says: ‘I didn’t get my lesson for to-day. Let’s start 
a discussion.” But the larger freedom given students 
in the conduct of the recitation frequently leads to the 
same result in actual practice. It is essential therefore 
that teacher and pupils learn from the beginning to 
be on their guard against the normal human tendency 
to wander, — a tendency that is to be observed all the 
way from the United States Senate to the literary 
society at Three Corners. 
Lack of Thoroughness. — The first objection to the 
socialized recitation is likely to be that it offers a plan 
of conducting work without much assurance of adequate 
mastery of subject matter. To one who has not seen 
the actual conduct of a good class under the socialized 
method it is almost certain to seem that codperation 
means such a division of labor as to make mastery of 
more than a fragment extremely unlikely. If this be 
true it offers an almost insurmountable obstacle to the 
success of the new method; for it is largely through 
subject matter that the individual can be socialized. 
If the pupil does not gain these ideas of history, of 
civics, of individual and public health, and of the 
mother tongue which society through the school offers, 
the most fundamental aims of education are lost. 
Learning to codperate with other members of a small 
group (a class), however valuable it may be, cannot 
compensate for a failure to gain the essentials of the 
content of school work. 
That the dangers indicated in the foregoing para- 
graph are real cannot be doubted. Moreover, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
Dangers to Avoid 67 
obvious that such dangers are continually present. 
However, the analogy of division of labor in class 
work with that involved in making a watch or a pair 
of shoes does not fit. In the making of a watch, for 
example, the various workers contribute individually 
to the making of a product which is for none of them, 
but for some prospective buyer; while in the case of 
the socialized recitation, or any recitation for that 
matter, all the contributions are to a product that is 
to be the possession of every member of the class. 
Furthermore, where there is constant insistence on the 
ideal of thoroughness, the results show that codperation 
may become an actual aid rather than an obstacle. 
Antisocial Feelings and Conduct. — Of the peculiar 
contradictions in human nature none is more worthy 
of note than that’ which produces the antisocial from 
the social. It is a matter of everyday observation 
that social pressure impels many to motives and acts 
which are harmful to society. The approval that 
society gives to the professions leads to their over- 
crowding. The social value of place or of possession 
often leads to acts that are not mildly antisocial but 
positively criminal. Among children similar contra- 
dictions between the social and the antisocial are to 
be observed. What is called school spirit may lead to 
acts that are unworthy, whether from the social or from 
the individual point of view. The desire to please 
the group may lead to conduct which is injurious to 
others, — as when the boy gang or team sanctions vari- 
ous kinds of depredations or unsportsmanlike conduct. 
In the socialized recitation the pressure of group 
feeling may lead to a feeling of bitterness that is a
-P-A-G-E-78
  
68 The Socialized Recitation 
hindrance to proper group conduct and development. . 
Rivalry (a feeling social in its essence) may possibly 
be carried beyond proper bounds. Comparison of self 
with others may result in a type of complacency or 
conceit that is particularly annoying. The socialized 
recitation is indeed exposed to the same dangers as 
society itself in these matters of feelings, motives, and 
conduct.) 
In this same connection an abuse is likely to arise 
from mere excess of enthusiasm — so much noise and 
confusion as to be antisocial in its results. Indeed 
some of the critics of the socialized recitation seem 
convinced that the outstanding characteristic of the 
method is confusion. It must be admitted that there 
is a real danger here; but it is the danger that ac- 
companies all freedom. Furthermore, as a matter 
of actual fact, much that appears as confusion to the 
person accustomed to the clasped-hands-on-desk type 
of recitation is in no way confusing to the pupils who 
are actively engaged in the discussion of a topic so 
interesting that it is hard for each to wait his proper 
time to speak. The true criterion of confusion is what 
is going on in the minds of the pupils. Judged by this 
standard, much that would be regarded as confusion 
by the strict-military-discipline type of teacher is 
nothing more than the sign of keen interest and urgent 
desire to participate in class activities. 
Perfunctory Routine. — Almost any kind of human 
activity is likely to develop a tendency toward formal- 
ism or perfunctoriness. No matter how vital the 
beginnings may be there often develops a machine-like 
procedure which nullifies the fundamental purposes of
-P-A-G-E-79
  Dangers to Avoid 69 
the original idea. This has been a tendency in religion, 
as we may see exemplified in the formalism which 
followed the Reformation. It may be seen in the great 
amount of perfunctory service on the part of public 
officials. The school offers various notable examples, 
such as the formalizing of the Pestalozzian method, 
of the kindergarten, of the Herbartian method of 
instruction, of instruction in hygiene, morals, and 
religion. 
Although the socialized recitation is fundamentally 
a form of conducting class work in such a way as to 
make a strong appeal to motives of great force, there 
occasionally appears a tendency to run along in a groove 
of perfunctoriness. Thus in an English class in whicha 
study of current events is the basis of part of the work, 
there are days on which pupils make their respective 
contributions just about as the secretary of an adult 
organization reads the minutes of the last meeting 
when such reading is a pure formality to which no one 
gives attention. 
It is no uncommon thing for a similar situation to 
arise in the socialized class in history, especially when 
the material under consideration makes no strong 
appeal. If the materials are too difficult to handle or 
too easy, the life is likely to go out of the work and the 
class procedure has a tendency to degenerate into mere 
routine grinding that is endured not in the hope of 
any intellectual reward but merely as a part of that 
dullness which fate has made a part of school work.) 
Excessive Social Pressure.— As a rule there is 
much more danger that a certain kind of social pressure 
will be excessive in the socialized recitation than there
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 The Socialized Recitation 
is that proceedings will degenerate into lifeless routine. 
Pride in accomplishment in the presence of others, 
keen competition between individuals, desire for group 
excellence, impatience with those who retard the group 
or who interfere with planned activities, contempt 
for those who do not rise to the level of excellence 
demanded by.the class, —all are operative in varying 
degrees. 
For average children there is little danger of these 
factors working to the detriment of intellectual work. 
But for those who are more than usually slow or diffi- 
dent there is considerable danger. The slow pupil 
often needs some one to encourage him and commend 
him for what he achieves; but a frequent tendency 
of the group, whether of children or adults, is to show 
impatience or scorn. Thus the one who needs patience 
and appreciation feels forced to remain in a state of 
inactivity because of his unwillingness to submit to 
the pressure that comes from the group. The sensitive 
pupil, even though he is of more than average ability, 
finds himself in a similar situation. The pressure of 
adverse group opinion is quite sure to be a continual 
source of fear to him, the result being that he cannot 
participate and develop as he should. 
Failure to Comprehend the Real Meaning of the 
Socialized Recitation. — Practically all the defects 
and dangers pointed out in this chapter arise from a 
failure on the part of teacher and pupils to understand 
just what socialization is and why the socialized reci- 
tation is introduced. Just as in our government a 
lack of understanding of what democracy is leads to 
such failures as have marked our progress in democracy,
-P-A-G-E-81
  Dangers to Avoid 71 
lack of comprehension may lead to defects in the 
application of the idea of the socialized recitation. 
Indeed a very large part of the work involved in this 
method of conducting class work and a great part of 
its value lie in educating pupils into such an under- 
standing of social relationships as will prevent or remove 
the dangers which have been enumerated. 
From even a cursory glance at the defects mentioned 
in this chapter it is plain that such evils as ‘‘ bossing ” 
by the officious, shirking responsibility, wasting time 
by rambling discussion, failure to secure mastery, the 
operation of antisocial motives, and failure to consider 
the feelings of others will all be minimized or removed 
by a thorough understanding of what it means to be 
socially minded. 
Whatever may be thought of the possibility of finding 
human beings, adults, or children, in whom antisocial 
forces are not at work, it is true that the socialized 
recitation generally offers a surer means of combating 
them than does the usual individualistic method of 
class work. The reason for this is that the teacher 
does not have to depend solely upon his own personal 
force and intelligence. He has to assist him the 
combined force of all social motives of his pupils — 
all directed not toward circumventing his plans but 
guided in such a way as to bring to realization the best 
that he can devise for the improvement of his pupils. 
Instead of suppressing the officious by sarcasm, reproof, 
punishment, he has the possibility of leading all (in- 
cluding the offenders) to an intelligent consideration 
of the situation and to such modification of conduct 
as will remove the offense. 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
72 The Socialized Recitation 
A similar remedy is at hand for waste of time what- 
ever the form, or for antisocial motives and conduct, 
or for superficial work. Indeed, whatever the defect 
or evil, normal children are not slow to comprehend 
the social loss that follows; nor are they uncertain in 
directing their united forces to the removal of the 
weakness when once they understand and feel that 
the group, not merely the teacher, suffers from the 
situation. It is this fact that makes the socialized 
recitation possible and insures its successful working 
under the guidance of a skillful teacher.

  CHAPTER VJ] 
QUALITIES TO DEVELOP 
Tur school has always been considered a place for 
accomplishing something more than mastery of certain 
intellectual elements of education. That something 
more consists of a large group of ideals, attitudes, 
practices, and habits, which, combined with the intel- 
lectual, aid in bringing the educative process to a suc- 
cessful outcome. Because it promises much for the 
development of essential ideals, attitudes, practices, 
and habits the socialized recitation is attracting an 
increasing amount of attention on the part of those 
teachers who give serious thought to the real purposes 
of education as seen in the developing characters of 
boys and girls. It is the purpose of this chapter to 
discuss some of the more important of the qualities 
which the teacher must continually have in mind in 
order to give adequate guidance to the process of 
socialization. These characteristics will be considered 
from two points of view : — 
(1) Work ideas, attitudes, and practices; and 
(2) Attitudes, ideals, and conduct concerned with 
others. 
Work Ipnas, Arrrrupes, AND PRACTICES 
Ideals of high-class intellectual work must stand 
out clearly as the foremost characteristic in any 
successful form of class work. No kind of teaching 
device can be satisfactory if it attracts more attention 
73
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 The Socialized Recitation 
to itself than to the quality of the work that is actually 
accomplished. )In the history of the doctrine of 
interest we can see how an important and essential 
idea has been distorted because of a failure to consider 
the real purpose of the doctrine. Frequently the idea, 
essential as it is to successful teaching, that effective 
effort grows out of worthy interest, has been the cause 
of much waste of time through trivial activities and 
mere entertainment, the reason being that the teacher 
(so-called) had more interest in interest than in the 
work which should have been the outcome of genuine 
interest properly used. 
From this fact, which is known to all students of 
modern history of education, teachers who try to 
introduce socialized methods should take warning. 
A zeal for the process of socialization which leads to 
neglect of intense intellectual effort is certain to fail even 
as socialization. If the subject matter has been prop- 
erly selected, it has in itself the materials which are 
essential to socialization, the materials which the social 
life of the present (including all that the present has 
of the past) provides for the development of the future. 
Although the idea of the proper selection of subject 
matter and its assimilation by pupils is one of the most 
elementary and fundamental principles of social 
education, we might disregard it and still be faced 
with the necessity of magnifying the importance of 
zeal for the highest quality of intellectual work. ‘The 
reason for this lies in the very constitution of the normal 
human being, child or adult; genuine satisfaction 
comes only from a sense of real achievement. 
This means that for normal pupils and teachers the
-P-A-G-E-85
  Qualities to Develop 15 
success of the socialized recitation is inseparably con- 
nected with a degree of accomplishment that arouses 
the feeling of satisfaction because of its excellence. 
Children and adults do sometimes become idlers, 
dawdlers, time-killers; but this condition is usually 
the result of maleducation operating against the normal 
tendency to find satisfaction in the worthy accomplish- 
ment of real work. 
The foundation then of the socialized recitation, as of 
every other teaching method, ‘is a feeling of the im- 
portance of doing real work of real merit, of building up 
in an orderly way a definite body of ideas, of stead- 
fastness in doing hard work.) Without this foundation 
the socialized recitation rests upon the sands of impulse 
and caprice; with it the method is founded upon a 
rock of adequate purpose. 
Willingness to assume class tasks or burdens is 
a second very essential attitude. In the class of low 
morale about the only reason for undertaking even 
a minimum of prescribed work is the desire to avoid 
the punishment of failure, — failure being measured 
not by lack of individual accomplishment or by neglect 
to contribute to the welfare of the group, but by the 
reaction of the teacher. If the teacher is half satisfied 
the pupil is wholly content. It is obvious that the 
socialized recitation cannot proceed for a single moment 
unless a very different spirit exists. 
P6rtunately the whole tendency of the process of 
socialization is to create such a feeling of regard for 
the opinion of the group and such a desire for the 
welfare of all that the satisfaction of contributing to 
the codperative effort of the class is sufficient to create
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 The Socialized Recitation 
an intense desire to participate in whatever work is to 
be done. Pupils who in ordinary circumstances 
might be content to sit back and wait until teacher 
compulsion produced effort are likely to become not 
merely willing, but enthusiastic, participants in class 
activities. I have seen the force of social environment 
cause diffident pupils to lose their self-conscious fears 
and the lazy to shake off sloth. Such is the social 
pressure that must be created if the socialized recita- 
tion is to operate successfully, — a force that vitalizes 
and encourages to mutually helpful effort. 
Pupils should be encouraged to find or make 
means necessary to carrying work forward. /Initia- 
tive and originality in formulating projects for the 
class or for the individual himself should stand high 
on the approved list of ideals and attitudes. There 
are many aspects of class work where it is possible for 
the teacher to permit pupils to make suggestions in 
regard to how to proceed. The situation may be as 
simple as settling a disagreement over the average 
size of farms in Iowa; or it may be as complex as the 
problem of discovering the causes of poverty. 
In either case much is gained if the pupils feel that 
they have the responsibility for finding out how to 
proceed, that they have freedom to go ahead without 
being moved like chessmen by the teacher. Even 
though the suggestions made by pupils have finally 
to be rejected for more economical methods known to 
the teacher only, it is worth while to give opportunity 
for thought concerning methods of procedure and for 
suggestions in regard to those methods. 
There are two good reasons for the practice suggested
-P-A-G-E-87
Qualities to Develop 77 
in the preceding paragraph. In the first place, the 
general spirit of the American people and the commonly 
accepted aim of education lead to a demand for a kind 
of education which is different from the type known as 
Prussian, which prepares children for obedience only. 
Every consideration tends to emphasize the idea that, 
while the virtue of obedience is not to be neglected, it 
is not to be carried to such a degree as to destroy the 
equally needed virtues of initiative, aggressiveness, and 
originality. 
Then in the second place, interest in school work and 
the feeling that it is worth while are increased by the 
practice of permitting pupils to make suggestions in 
regard to methods of carrying out class projects, or, 
better, by the practice of making pupils feel that they 
are responsible for part of the task of finding or making 
the means necessary to carrying work forward) In 
degrees varying with the advancement of the chil- 
dren this idea applies to practically all grades of the 
school. 
The active quest of materials bearing upon the 
work under discussion is one of the most essential 
characteristics of the socialized recitation. That pas- 
sive or indifferent attitude of pupils which permits 
them to accept without question any form of words 
presented is deadly in its effect upon class work; and 
yet it characterizes a great deal of what goes on under 
the title of recitation in elementary school, high school, 
and even college. The defect lies in the lack of vitality 
which is a characteristic of much of the material of 
the school. In contrast with this condition is the 
alertness or eagerness which characterizes the really 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 The Socialized Recitation 
socialized recitation, in which there is no passive 
acceptance of recitations by other pupils or of instruc- 
tion by the teacher. 
To illustrate I may cite an incident from a sixth- 
grade recitation in which the differences between 
English and American farming were under discussion. 
A member of the class was making a short report in 
which he stated that in one country the farming was 
intensive, in the other extensive. Immediately an 
alert pupil who was puzzled by the terms used inquired, 
“What do you mean by intensive and extensive?” 
The pupil who was leading the discussion unfortunately 
had learned the words but had neglected to study their 
meaning. His attempt to explain was unsatisfactory. 
No one in the class understood the real meaning. 
This gave the teacher an excellent opportunity (which 
she used) to impress upon the children the idea that 
in making a report it is very necessary to get real 
meanings, ideas, not merely to present words. 
In the quest of materials pupils may be trained and 
should be trained to seek supplementary materials in 
works at their command, even though there may be 
no definite assignment of certain details. The situa- 
tion which exists in the socialized recitation places a 
premium upon doing this, since it gives the pupil an 
appreciative audience for his contribution and gives 
him the immediate reward of satisfying the desire of 
others for knowledge. The study of supplementary and 
collateral materials thus comes to have a significance 
which does not exist where the chief aim of the class 
must be that of satisfying the teacher through the 
mastery of prescribed material. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  Qualities to Develop 79 
The practice of taking up new work when that 
assigned is finished should be built up through 
continual attention. Here is one of the hardest tests 
of the morale of a class or school. As indicated in 
the beginning of this chapter, the success of the socializ- 
ing method is to be judged very largely by the creation 
and development of the work attitude. In the matter 
of taking up new work instead of dawdling and wasting 
time we find that socialization is revealed in two ways: 
in conduct that shows a sense of the obligation to 
consider others, especially as they are engaged in 
work; and in that kind of pressure which makes it 
appear clearly that the school is a place of conscientious 
effort rather than an institution in which to spend 
several more or less unhappy hours a day. 
Often the child who has finished an assignment will 
find nothing better to do than to make himself mildly 
obnoxious to other pupils who have work still to do. 
Under the guidance of a good teacher the force of the 
socialized class may be turned in the direction of 
making it “good form” not merely to keep from 
interfering with others, but much more to engage in 
activities that are profitable to the individual or to the 
class even though assigned work has been finished. 
In doing this the individual pupil is making his slight 
contribution toward social relations that are harmo- 
nious; he is also laying the foundation for that type of 
character that in later life will know how to utilize 
leisure. 
The cultivation of a sense of values is absolutely 
essential in the operation of the socialized method. 
The ability to guard against the irrelevant and trivial
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 The Socialized Recitation 
and to judge between the important and the unimpor- 
tant ought always to be carefully cherished. Or per- 
haps it would be better to express the idea as the ability 
to select from a mass of materials that which is valuable 
and essential and to cleave to that which is really 
important. As the tendency of the socialized recita- 
tion is to increase the amount of freedom which pupils 
exercise in handling material as well as in matters of 
conduct and discipline, it is apparent that wise use of 
such freedom demands an increasing ability to exercise 
judgment in regard to values, — that success must be 
determined in large part by progress in this matter. 
The natural tendency of the immature mind is to be 
led astray by details which are entertaining, bizarre, 
trivial. It may seem more interesting to read the 
details of Lloyd George’s game of golf after a stormy 
session of parliament than to study how the govern- 
ment dealt with the great railway strike of 1919; or 
tales of court life in the days of the Grand Monarch 
may be much more fascinating than an attempt to get 
an appreciation of the economic situation of those days. 
But if the purpose of a class is to gain some real com- 
prehension of the world of events to-day or to under- 
stand the real history of France, the sense of values 
must operate in such a manner as to magnify the 
important and minimize the trivial. It may be added 
that it is only through the use of a significant purpose 
that such selection is possible ; for the basis of selection 
must be not feeling but judgment. 
A corollary of the principle of selection upon the 
basis of value contributing to the purpose at hand is 
the idea of comprehending the relation of the details
-P-A-G-E-91
Qualities to Develop 81 
to the whole. Without such selection the net result 
of class work is likely to be a poorly assorted conglom- 
eration of ideas, important in themselves perhaps but 
practically valueless as a foundation of real understand- 
ing. This principle is of special importance in such 
subjects as history, community civics, economics, and 
natural science, — subjects in which masses of uncon- 
nected ideas are practically valueless. 
Ipmats AND Practices ReLatine To OTHERS 
Good will toward others is the very foundation of 
socialization. ‘Within the past few years we have 
seen this idea exemplified on a stupendous scale. All 
the numerous efforts to codperate in voluntary activ- 
ities for promoting the welfare of soldiers and sailors 
show the value of a foundation of good will for such 
codperation. Before the war the Salvation Army, for 
example, had been looked upon with a certain amount 
of rather tolerant amusement by the masses of our 
citizens. The very first thing in preparing the public 
to contribute largely to its support was building up a 
feeling of good will toward the organization, — good 
will growing out of an intelligent conception of what 
the organization was actually doing for the men at 
the front. 
Attempts to secure codperation through force where 
good will did not exist led to much bitterness in some 
campaigns for raising funds for worthy purposes and 
did a kind of harm the evil effects of which will be felt 
in some neighborhoods for years, —as in those cases 
where yellow paint was used as a means of coercing 
persons suspected of sympathy for the German cause.
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 The Socialized Recitation 
On a much smaller scale we find that in groups made 
up of few members the feeling of good will is the very 
most fundamental factor in successful codperation. 
In professional baseball a single person who has a 
feeling of hostility against manager or team mates 
ean cause irreparable damage. In college and high 
school sports the existence of good will among the 
members of the team is a first essential. The organiza- 
tion which harbors feelings of jealousy or ill will is 
doomed to failure if it meets players of equal ability 
who are animated by a different spirit. 
In the socialized recitation the relationships are so 
immediately personal, the possibilities of friction are 
so great, that without a foundation of good will the 
possibility of effective work is very greatly decreased. 
On the other hand, when there is a feeling of harmony, 
when each pupil desires the good of his fellows, efforts 
to master subject matter and attempts to produce 
improvement are almost inevitably sure of success; 
for the natural outcome of good will is mutual helpful- 
ness in matters of concern to members of the group. 
Courtesy is an essential accompaniment of good 
will. It is an essential lubricant for the decreasing of 
the friction which close personal relationships easily 
generate. In the ordinary recitation there are certain 
. to arise disagreements in regard to facts, interpretations, 
and inferences. The normal human tendency is for 
the individual to believe that he is right, to believe 
that those in disagreement are stupid or silly, and to 
express both the belief and the feeling. The usual 
result is resentment and a reciprocal expression of 
sentiment with added force. Most of us learn with
-P-A-G-E-93
  Qualities to Develop 83 
more or less difficulty that the road to successful work 
lies along the line of harmonious relationships with our 
fellow workers. It is very hard for children to learn 
this lesson without great cost. 
There are many opportunities for the exercise of 
courtesy in any kind of recitation where there is freedom 
of expression and discussion. ‘The first thing for pupils 
to learn is to give an attentive hearing to others, to 
cultivate a feeling of respect for the opinions of others.’ 
A step in advance is taken when the child learns to be 
courteous to those who are not in agreement with him. 
Especially for children who have not been well trained 
at home is it difficult to keep from some such reaction 
as, “If you had a particle of sense, you wouldn’t dis- 
agree with me.” To learn to listen open-mindedly 
and courteously and to say, “ Perhaps you are right, 
what is your reason or authority?” is to make a tre- 
mendous gain in the process of becoming socialized. 
Sometimes it is necessary to eradicate coarseness and 
crudities of speech which reflect the language of the 
street or perhaps of the home. As courtesy grows, its 
application to various matters becomes clearer, as, 
for example, in such matters as engaging in forms of 
activity that are annoying to others, — whispering, 
writing notes, and various other forms of disorder. 
In a higher form it may rise to the level of a sincere 
effort to cultivate pleasing personality, less for the 
purpose of magnifying the self than for the sake of 
giving pleasure to others. 
It is no uncommon thing for the teacher who begins 
the work of socializing a class to find that the increased 
freedom, the greater opportunity for finding real values
-P-A-G-E-94
  
  84 The Socialized Recitation 
in work, and the operation of strong social pressure 
make pupils so enthusiastic and so tremendously 
earnest that a great deal of heat is occasionally gen- 
erated. The result is likely to be various forms of 
conduct that interfere with work. Consequently it 
becomes necessary to devote a great deal of attention 
to little matters of courtesy, consideration of others, 
to the end that pupils may learn to give and to receive 
criticism properly, to repress exclamations that may 
create bitterness, and to show continually that desire 
for mutual helpfulness that is the outcome of good will 
and the basis of true courtesy. 
It may be worth while to point out that courtesy 
does not mean mere acquiescence in all matters merely 
for the sake of avoiding disagreement. That is not 
true courtesy which pretends agreement while doubtful 
or unconvinced. The courteous pupil will learn to 
defend his own ideas vigorously, but without giving 
unnecessary offense. Out of respect to himself and 
to the mental integrity of others he will adhere to what 
he believes right until good reasons to the contrary 
are given. He will learn to admit mistakes and per- 
haps even to feel grateful to the critic who helps free 
his mind from error. In all this he will, under skillful 
training, develop that kind of tact which enables him 
to do the proper thing at the proper time without giving 
needless offense. 
The socialized recitation demands the develop- 
ment of the feeling of codperativeness. It is very 
necessary to have a spirit of helpfulness in guiding 
class activities to good ends, an eagerness to be of 
help to others. Through this feeling each is led to
-P-A-G-E-95
  
Qualities to Develop 85 
assume his fair share of burdens when labor is divided, 
to take his part in class discussions, to “‘ hold up his 
end.”’ As the ideal of coéperativeness is contrary to 
the spirit that characterizes a great deal of school work, 
giving or receiving help being scholastic lése-majesté, 
the teacher who introduces the socialized method 
is almost certain to have more or less difficulty in 
developing the right spirit. On the one hand is the 
extreme of officious interference in the name of help- 
fulness; on the other, is mere independence of action, 
valuable as one phase of development, but not a sub- 
stitute for codperation. 
But as soon as pupils become thoroughly convinced 
that the teacher is in earnest in introducing the social 
spirit as well as the form of social action into class work, 
the normal human tendency to like to work together 
with others asserts itself. Gradually there disappears 
the feeling of unwillingness to accept suggestions from 
others and the unwillingness to give others the benefit 
of ideas that niay be of mutual advantage; or rather, 
the old practice of doing these things surreptitiously 
becomes the new coéperation, a kind of “‘ new freedom.” 
When the spirit of mutual helpfulness that often has to 
work in secret can work freely in the open a great deal 
of socialization has been accomplished. 
The feeling of obligation to contribute to class 
work or group activity is a necessary accompaniment 
of the desire to be helpful.\ The feeling of codpera- 
tiveness is often sufficient to secure the necessary 
activities; but as an ever ready assistant it should 
have a growing sense of responsibility, a kind of school 
conscience which will force the individual to profitable .
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 The Socialized Recitation 
activity even when his instinctive liking for working 
with others sinks into eclipse. This feeling of respon- 
sibility gains power by being related to the pressure of 
the group rather than the mere autocratic will of the 
teacher. It is remarkable how pupils who are inclined 
to lag, to be content with an intellectual status that 
shows accomplishment just a little below what is con- 
sidered a satisfactory level, respond to this feeling of 
responsibility to the group. To the laggard the group 
says: “ This is our group. We want to keep our work 
right up. You get to work and do your share.” 
To this class attitude the slow or lazy or irresponsible 
pupil is pretty certain to respond. It touches a spot 
that urging by the teacher does not reach.) But if 
for any reason it is impossible to arouse a feeling of 
responsibility for the success of group activities, the 
teacher may understand that the process of socializa- 
tion has been blocked or that it has not yet begun; 
for this feeling is one of the fundamentals of social 
progress whether in school or outside. 
The sacrifice of personal wishes for the good of 
the class is a virtue which pupils need to learn early 
in the process of socialization. In terms of positive 
activity rather than sacrifice this is to be interpreted 
as adapting the individual’s own work to the good of 
the class or to the wishes of the majority. As not 
every one can have his own will all the time when there 
is a conflict of wishes, it is very necessary for every 
pupil to cultivate the ideal of being a “ good loser ” 
on those occasions when he must bow to the will of the 
majority. To learn not to sulk when his own ends are 
not gained, to master the tendency to become angry
-P-A-G-E-97
Qualities to Develop 87 
when disappointed, these are two of the most essential 
characteristics of any person who hopes to live com- 
fortably among his fellows. 
Another way in which the idea of personal subordina- 
tion to the good of the group appears is in the suppres- 
sion (voluntary, if possible) of the desire of a few 
students to monopolize the center of the stage. They 
are known to every teacher, known but not appreciated 
at their own conception of value. There arises, 
because of them, the very delicate problem of keeping 
their ambitions within due bounds without causing 
them to feel offended or discouraged. Very often 
they are the “ life of the class ’’ ; and to suppress them 
harshly is to put a damper on class spirit, to run the 
risk of crushing much of the spontaneity that should 
properly characterize the work of the socialized class. 
However, if they are not properly controlled, their 
tendency to monopolize class activities results in the 
suppression of other members of the class who are not 
so eager to appear in the limelight. Whatever can 
be done to help pupils develop an unassuming attitude 
toward their fellows is a valuable contribution to the 
future happiness of all concerned. 
A feeling of freedom is another very desirable 
characteristic. The absence of spontaneity at once 
creates the suspicion that the process of socialization 
has not proceeded far; but on the contrary the mere 
presence of spontaneity is not in itself sufficient evidence 
that real socialization of the right kind is taking place. 
Teachers who lack insight are too likely to believe 
that a mere condition of sprightliness and volunteering 
to recite is the end sought. In contrast with this is the
-P-A-G-E-98
88 The Socialized Recitation 
truth of the matter: freedom is but a means of promot- 
ing the work of developing essential social virtues and 
of securing effective mastery of subject matter. This 
is but a paraphrase of the idea that development must 
come through self-activity rather than through repres- 
sion and compulsion. 
Unless a feeling of freedom exists there is little oppor- 
tunity for the development of real courtesy ; for little 
can happen that can possibly call forth courteous action. 
Similarly the codperative spirit is likely to languish 
unless it is sustained by the possibility of spontaneous 
activity. Even the feeling of obligation to contribute 
to class activity is almost certain to lack vitality if it 
is not accompanied by that freedom which gives 
responsibility significance; for the obligation to be a 
participating member of the group loses its internal 
compulsion unless the pupil feels free to make his con- 
tribution unhindered by repression. 
A sense of the value of time is of tremendous 
importance in the socialized recitation. As a rule 
the method requires more time than is the case where 
the teacher rushes matters through. It cannot be 
denied that when the process of socialization is added 
to that of mastering subject matter there is need for 
great economy of time during the class period. Other- 
wise each day will find the class handicapped because of 
failure to cover the materials that properly belonged 
to that day’s work. The need of developing a sense of 
the value of time is further emphasized by the fact 
that in any kind of group activity, individual waste is 
multiplied by the number in the group. When the 
individual is alone and wastes five minutes, the loss  
-P-A-G-E-99
  Qualities to Develop © 89 
is just that. But if in a class of twenty he wastes five 
minutes of class time, the total is twenty times five. 
Fortunately the normal child responds to the idea of 
multiple loss of time,—as indeed he responds to 
almost every kind of social pressure. The individual 
who is perfectly willing to suffer a loss that affects him 
alone is likely to be deterred by the idea that others 
have to pay the penalty of his wrong conduct or care- 
lessness. What a contrast between this kind of conduct 
and that in which the pupil works, avoids intellectual 
rambling or time-killing, and refrains from interfering 
with others because of the personal domination of the 
teacher ! 
In those classes in which there is division of labor 
and materials are assigned for individual study and 
reports, it may be rather difficult in the beginning to 
get pupils to realize the importance of promptness 
in the preparation of their work. The diffident pupil 
is likely to be “not quite ready ” and the careless 
child is likely to have forgotten that he was to make 
a special report. The result is that there is a gap in 
the development of subject matter and for the time 
being the machinery breaks down. Here as elsewhere 
the teacher should refrain from assuming the attitude 
that lack of promptness is a personal offense against 
his majesty as teacher, but should show clearly that the 
failure to be ready means loss of time to all the members 
of the class. 
Finally, the cultivation of adequate expression 
contributes very largely to the success of the social- 
ized recitation. In the form of recitation which 
makes little or no use of the social idea (if such can  
-P-A-G-E-100
90 The Socialized Recitation 
possibly exist) expression involves little of the idea of 
communication, — the pupil merely pouring out some- 
thing which the other members of the class already 
know or think they know and which the teacher also 
knows. Hence the only persons really concerned are 
the teacher and the pupil reciting. No one who hasever 
seen a socialized recitation can have failed to note the 
degree of attention which members of the class give the 
one who happens to be making his contribution or to 
notice the effort which the pupil who has the floor makes 
to convey his ideas to his listeners. 
Here is the opportunity of the teacher to place stress 
upon such ideas as clear enunciation, addressing class 
rather than teacher, clearness and coherence of ideas, 
—indeed all the qualities that characterize good 
form in oral communication. A detail which frequently 
has to receive attention is that of having children make 
reports in their own words rather than “ rattle off” 
material from text or reference work verbatim. The 
need here is especially noticeable in the case of those 
pupils who have good verbal memory. The remedy 
is continual insistence upon ideas rather than mere 
words.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE/PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHER 
Tuer casual observer of a well-conducted socialized 
recitation is likely to come away thinking, “‘ This is 
certainly easy for the teacher; for he turns all the 
work over to the pupils.” There is a certain amount of 
truth in this view: the teacher does refrain from doing 
work which the pupils ought to do; he carefully 
deprives himself of the pleasure of reciting for them 
and spares himself the torture of pumping out fragments 
of topics studied. He keeps himself in the background 
and gives his pupils the center of the stage. Yet noth- 
ing could be farther from the truth than the idea that 
the teacher is having an easy time. Indeed the proper 
application of the socialized recitation idea means 
greatly increased work for the teacher, — or at the very 
least an exchange of work of one kind for an equal 
amount of a different kind. 
In the ordinary recitation the teacher can manipulate 
matters'in such a way as to conceal the fact that he 
has but a meager stock of subject matter; but in the 
socialized type of work, it is necessary that he be 
familiar with a great deal of material and with the 
sources from which it may be obtained. Otherwise 
his guidance of the class will show very evident defects. 
In the second place, there is likely to be greater demand 
for guidance in the actual preparation of materials, 
91
-P-A-G-E-102
    
92 The Socialized Recitation 
— a deeper feeling of need for real supervision of study. 
And in the third place the teacher must attend continu- 
ally to the varying phases of the process of socialization. 
Without this attention on his part the success of the 
class has to depend upon the mere chance that the 
pupils — immature as they are — will have the wisdom 
to do what adults find great difficulty in doing, — 
to plan and execute ideas that will result in the social 
welfare of the group. The increased demand for 
thorough familiarity with subject matter, the necessity 
of superior guidance in the preparation of lessons, 
and the constant need of attention to the development 
of social qualities make it evident that the socialized 
recitation is no labor-saving device for the teacher. 
While all the preceding chapters may be considered 
as laying out the work which the teacher has to do, 
it is the purpose of this final chapter to discuss the 
teacher’s problems from a slightly different point of 
view. Here we shall consider what the teacher has 
to be under the following heads: (1) as spectator and 
student of class affairs; (2) as guide in planning and 
executing work; (3) as counselor in matters of social 
significance — conduct; (4) as judge of work and 
development; (5) as a socializing force. 
The Teacher as Onlooker and Student of Class 
Problems. — The first demand of every teacher is 
that he be a careful student of the problems of his 
work. In ready-made methods of teaching this fact 
is concealed behind the machinery which character- 
izes the work. Indeed, many such methods have been 
devised because of the fact that teachers were unable 
or unwilling to make careful study of their prob-  
-P-A-G-E-103
  
The Problems of the Teacher 93 
lems. Even Pestalozzi believed that it was necessary 
to devise a method as simple as A B C which any 
teacher could put into successful operation. Be- 
cause of the immaturity of a very large part of the 
teaching population of to-day and also because of the 
fact that teaching in elementary schools is a very 
transitory kind of career, ending before inexperience 
has ceased to be a marked characteristic of the teacher, 
there is still much search for a pedagogical philosopher’s 
stone which will transmute all teaching into educational 
gold. In spite of all this there can be no doubt that the 
real teacher is the one who continually feels the need 
of making teaching problems his constant study. 
If the foregoing facts apply to the ordinary process 
of teaching, they apply with double force to the work 
of any one who is trying to conduct a class by the 
socialized method. Here is a new field in which 
there is as yet no single ready-made plan for carrying 
on the work, — in which it is to be hoped that there 
never will be such a process of mechanizing. Every 
pupil who is in the socialized class offers special prob- 
lems, not merely as an intellect striving to master cer- 
tain materials, but as a person whose individuality is to 
be realized chiefly through his relationships with others. 
Every individual and all these relationships demand 
patient study on the part of any person — parent or 
teacher — who aspires to the honor of being a real 
educator. All that has been said in preceding chapters 
in regard to dangers to avoid and qualities to cultivate 
further emphasizes the scope of the field for study by 
the teacher who undertakes to conduct the socialized 
recitation. It must therefore be clear that the teacher
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 The Socialized Recitation 
is no mere idle onlooker, but must continually be a 
student occupied with a great variety of matters which 
contribute to the success of the method. $ 
The Teacher as Guide.— In any kind of school 
work it is taken for granted that the teacher will mark 
out the path that the pupil is to pursue and will take 
pains to see that he does not wander much from the way. 
In the ordinary recitation the teacher accomplishes 
this by keeping every phase of the process of reciting 
—if not of studying — under his immediate super- 
vision. In the socialized recitation, however, more 
freedom being allowed the pupils, guidance becomes 
a different matter. The teacher cannot be a kind of 
intellectual mule driver armed with a sharp goad to 
keep the wanderer in the path and the lazy on the 
move. He becomes rather a kind of Alpine guide, 
who, familiar with all the paths and bypaths himself, 
places himself at the service of others who wish to make 
their way to the pleasant grottoes and the inspiring 
heights. 
It must be admitted that the task of guiding pupils 
in the selection and mastery of subject matter demands 
much more skill than the mere work of prescribing 
certain lessons and demanding thorough study of them. 
In the lower grades where a group of pupils engage in 
socialized work for mere drill in certain fundamental 
mechanical processes there is comparatively little for 
the teacher to do; but in the fields, such as history or 
geography, where the amount of material is very great, 
the task of guiding pupils into something more than a 
mere memorizing of details in a given text becomes a 
difficult problem for the teacher.
-P-A-G-E-105
  The Problems of the Teacher 95 
Neither pupils nor teacher can be happy in the work 
if it is confined to such narrow limits that individual 
pupils of initiative and ambition are deprived of the 
satisfaction of contributing to the class such materials 
as supplement and enrich the central outline of the 
lesson. It is here that the function of the teacher as 
guide becomes evident. Pupils need help in selecting 
topics for investigation, in searching for materials 
relevant to the ideas which they hope to present for 
the benefit of their fellow students, and often in arrang- 
ing those materials for effective presentation. 
In connection with the study of the problems in- 
volved in the opening up of the West, for example, 
some pupil may, of his own initiative or at the sugges- 
tion of the teacher, desire to investigate the special 
problems of navigating Western rivers such as the 
Missouri or Kansas. Unless the teacher is familiar 
enough with the materials to give the pupil guidance 
in his search there is likely to be considerable loss of 
time or perhaps complete disappointment and failure. 
As such voluntary investigations are a frequent hap- 
pening in the conduct of the socialized recitation, 
indeed as they are a characteristic which is definitely 
cultivated by the teacher, it is evident that guidance 
for the pupil is of highest importance. 
The Teacher as Counselor.—In the preceding 
section the point of view was that of mastery of subject 
matter. Here we turn to problems of conduct. Too 
often in the routine of school work the teacher feels 
called upon to give counsel in matters of conduct only 
when some abuse needs to be remedied. The process 
is negative rather than positive ; a fault is to be removed
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 The Socialized Recitation 
rather than a virtue built up. As long as matters run 
smoothly without any evident offenses against the 
ordinary rules governing class conduct, it is likely to 
seem that there is no occasion for special attention to 
such qualities as are enumerated in Chapter VI. But 
when the teacher comprehends the spirit and purpose of 
the socialized recitation, it is evident at once that in 
every pupil there are latent possibilities of development 
which need frequent sympathetic attention. 
It is hardly to be expected in ordinary cases that the 
pupils will of themselves see the need of taking counsel 
with some older person in order to secure the means of 
development. It is the teacher rather who must take 
the initiative. Although this is a matter of extreme 
difficulty, which adds greatly to the work of the 
teacher, it is just the kind of work that raises teaching 
from the level of monotonous repetition of subject 
matter long familiar to the teacher to the plane of 
developing personalities, the plane which all good 
teachers have always sought to reach. 
How to help the diffident rise to self-reliant participa- 
tion in class activities, how to give the unduly aggressive 
a proper appreciation of the rights of others, how to 
teach the selfish the art of giving to others as well as 
receiving from them, what means to use in transform- 
ing the lazy and indifferent into the industrious and 
enthusiastic, when to concentrate social pressure and 
when to relax its force, where to lay the hand of re- 
straint and where to allow widest liberty, — all these 
and many others are problems which demand that the 
teacher develop the art of giving counsel in the most 
effective manner.
-P-A-G-E-107
  The Problems of the Teacher 97 
In all these matters the teacher must learn to secure 
through suggestion and other indirect means that 
attitude on the part of the pupils which will lead them 
to appreciate the need of making him an effective 
member of the group — effective because of his par- 
ticipation in building up those qualities which make 
school and life the most efficient type of social living. 
The Teacher as Judge of Progress. — From time 
to time it is necessary to apply some systematic method 
of judging work accomplished, —a method more 
thorough than the ordinary day to day reflection of 
opinion in regard to achievement. Unless there is a 
systematic judging of achievement, progress is likely 
to be spasmodic, uncertain, or altogether lacking. 
The necessity of such judging is taken for granted 
in the ordinary recitation, in which the teacher gen- 
erally makes frequent use of the question as a means 
of finding out how well pupils have mastered the work ; 
but in the socialized recitation, the teacher being 
somewhat in the background, there is often a tendency 
to neglect the work of measuring progress — unless 
(as should be the case) the organization of the class 
makes provision for the office of student-critic. Even 
where the class has risen to the level of attempting to 
judge its own work, it is necessary that the teacher 
continue to act as critic, measurer, judge — whether 
in a noticeable way or not. 
In the first place it is necessary to pay heed to the 
extent to which subject matter is mastered. As 
emphasized repeatedly in these pages, if the socialized 
recitation cannot or does not secure that degree of 
excellence which is demanded by supervisors and 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 The Socialized Recitation 
patrons, there is no place for it in our scheme of educa- 
tion. This mastery of content must be interpreted : 
(1) as applying to the materials that are taken up 
day by day; (2) as relating to the task of covering 
the field that is prescribed’as the work for a given unit 
of time —a semester or year. This means that the 
teacher must be a continual judge of daily mastery on 
the one hand and of advancement on the other. 
In the second place, as may be inferred from the 
chapter on qualities to develop, the teacher has also 
the obligation to judge various personal characteristics 
in order that abuses may not arise or continue and that 
the desirable aspects of personality may have opportu- 
nity to develop. Itis not to be assumed that in judging 
various matters that pertain to conduct the teacher 
will measure in the same way as in estimating progress 
in the learning of a vocabulary or in acquiring skill in 
typewriting. The result is the same, however: a 
definite judgment in regard to the condition that 
actually exists is used as the basis of guidance in future 
development. 
The Teacher as a Socializing Force. — Everything 
that has been said in the preceding sections of this 
chapter is based upon the idea that the great work of 
the teacher is to aid in the process of developing the 
latent social possibilities of children. A further idea 
needs emphasis, however: this work is not to be ad- 
vanced in an impersonal manner as if the teacher were 
merely a biped textbook; but it can be accomplished 
only through actual mental contacts. 
In the development of social work in the large cities, 
it has frequently happened that a great gap has arisen
-P-A-G-E-109
  The Problems of the Teacher 99 
between those who have charge of the work and those 
for whose benefit it is attempted. The machinery is 
all set up and in operation; but the actual feeling of 
personal interest and personal contact is too often 
lacking. The poor are treated as if they were no more 
human than the cards which contain their records, with 
the result that most of the social possibilities of relief 
work are lost. 
Similarly an abuse has occasionally arisen in the 
administration of the work of vocational guidance. 
The person seeking guidance is recorded, indexed, and 
filed as if he were a specimen for preservation in a 
museum. His existence as a human being with certain 
social possibilities is forgotten. Rare as these abuses 
are in social work, they suggest a danger that is to be 
found in the school as well as in charity organizations 
and vocational guidance bureaus. 
! “However smoothly the machinery of the socialized 
recitation may run, it is not accomplishing its real 
purpose unless the teacher is able to put into effective 
operation that intangible something which humanizes 
the work. The young and inexperienced teacher is 
likely to fear to let his personality shine — either 
because of diffidence or because of the suspicion that 
unless he remains aloof and impersonal his pupils will 
take advantage of him. The experienced teacher may 
have fallen into a type of routine which has the same 
general effect. In either case it is absolutely necessary 
to open up the channels through which personal influ- 
ence may flow. It is only in this way that the teacher 
can really be a socializing force.
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 The Socialized Recitation 
A Last Worp 
With many teachers the question will rise: “Can I 
manipulate the machinery of the socialized recitation 
in such a way as to secure better results than with my 
present method?” The answer must be conditional, 
as this is not a bow for every man to shoot. There 
can be no good reason, however, for any teacher’s 
failing to make greater and greater efforts to carry on 
the actual work of socialization, regardless of class 
method. It is for this purpose — socialization — that 
the school exists; it is for this that the teacher has a 
place in the social structure ; it is to this same end that 
all the great forces of progress and of culture continually 
contribute. 
The measure of the teacher’s success, then, is to be 
found in the degree to which he carries on the work of 
socializing his pupils. If he accomplishes this in 
spirit and in truth, regardless of the form which his 
class work may take, he is making a contribution to 
society which is beyond all price. To help him make 
this contribution is the sole purpose of the socialized 
recitation.

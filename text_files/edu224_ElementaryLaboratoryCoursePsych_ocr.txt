  INTRODUCTION 
Ir has been our aim in preparing this manual to describe the 
experiments in such a manner that students who have had only 
an introductory course in psychology may be able to perform 
them without further assistance. With this in mind we have tried 
to give full and minute descriptions even to the point of explain- 
ing what may seem obvious to many. We have also given exact 
directions in regard to the recording of results, even to the extent 
of supplying models for the tables when necessary, for we consider 
that training in the systematic arrangement of results is one of the 
purposes of an experimental course. 
The selection of the experiments has been conditioned by the 
following practical and theoretical requirements: — 
x. It should be possible to perform all the experiments in a half- 
course of five hours a week. 
. It should be possible to perform the experiments with very 
simple and inexpensive instruments. In most instances when 
complicated instruments have been employed an additional 
experiment with simple apparatus has been described. Two 
or three experiments, owing to their importance, have been 
included which demand special instruments. These experi- 
ments have been starred. 
3. It is necessary in most institutions that the experiments be 
performed by the entire class in one room. It is obvious, 
therefore, that some experiments in audition, vision, etc., 
had to be omitted. ; 
4. The experiments should not be too difficult for students be- 
ginning psychology. In fact it is hoped that the book may 
prove useful not only for class work, but for private students 
who desire an introductory knowledge of experimental psy- 
chology. vs 
1Zo0R7.

    iv INTRODUCTION 
5. The experiments should present the most essential features 
in method and the important facts of psychology. 
6. It should be possible to obtain clean-cut results and they 
should be capable of treatment by the student. 
7. The experiments should not be too fatiguing as would be a 
complete verification of Weber’s Law, nor disagreeable as 
are many of the taste and smell experiments. 
In order to meet these conditions, compromises had to be made, 
and for one reason or another some experiments have been 
omitted which appear in standard textbooks. On the other hand, 
new experiments, arranged to cover what seemed to us important 
facts, have been included. 
Questions have been appended to each experiment. These 
have been carefully arranged to direct the student’s attention to 
the main purpose of the experiment, to the reasons for the various 
stages in the method, to the connection between the results of the 
various experiments, to the facts and theories, both physiological 
and psychological, connected with the experiment, and to the 
practical application of the results. The difficult questions have 
been starred and may be omitted if deemed advisable. 
Most of the experiments are to be performed by the students 
working in pairs. One student acts as subject, the other as 
experimenter. A few experiments, entitled “ Individual Experi- 
ment ”’ are performed by each student upon himself. Some im- 
portant experiments, however, could not be arranged to be per- 
formed by each pair of students separately. These are entitlec 
“Class Experiment.” In these the instructor or one of the stu- 
dents acts as experimenter and the class as a whole acts as 
subject. 
It is advisable to tabulate as far as possible the results of all 
the members of the class for a comparison of the individual rec- 
ords, and also to obtain averages for large groups. Directions for 
doing this have been given in a number of experiments. If the 
class is very large, however, this must be omitted, unless the class 
can be divided into small sections.

  INTRODUCTION v 
We must acknowledge our indebtedness to Professor E. B. 
Titchener’s Experimental Psychology. As the influence of this book 
is felt in every corner of the psychological laboratory of to-day, 
an attempt to make specific acknowledgments to him would, we 
fear, involve grave omissions. We have also profited from An 
Experimental Study of Sensation, by Professors E. B. Holt and 
R. M. Yerkes. We used this book at Harvard for a number of 
years and have received numerous suggestions from it. One of 
the experiments on “Attention” was devised by Professor Miin- 
sterberg, and we have to thank him for his permission to use it as 
well as for his valuable advice. We also wish to thank Professor 
E. B. Holt for his aid in several important decisions, and Profes- 
sor W. F. Dearborn for suggestions regarding some of the problems 
of perception.

FOREWORD TO THE STUDENT 
At the beginning of the course you are to select a congenial 
partner with whom to work. It is advisable that this partnership 
remain unchanged throughout the semester. One member of the 
pair acts as subject and the other as experimenter. These posi- 
tions must be reversed in the successive experiments, the subject 
in one experiment being the experimenter in the next. Some ex- 
periments, however, are repeated so that each member shall have 
the experience both of experimenter and of subject. The work is 
done at small tables, the subject being seated opposite the experi- 
menter. 
It is the aim of experimental psychology, as it is of every other 
science, to be exact. You are therefore to take the greatest care 
in the arrangement of the experiment, so that the mind of the sub- 
ject can be studied under known conditions. The observations 
must also be most conscientiously made and the results accurately 
recorded. 
You must realize the importance of these requirements from the 
start. Remember that it is an ideal of science that experiments 
shall be capable of repetition at some future time under the same 
conditions. If these conditions are not accurately known, there 
is small possibility of verifying the results, and without such veri- 
fication the results will have very little if any scientific value. 
The experimenter is able to control and describe the outer con- 
ditions of the experiment; the subject must control and describe as 
far as possible his own states of mind. This observation of his 
mental states is known as ‘ introspection,’ and in all the experi- 
ments the subject is called on to report upon these states. The 
records must contain both the so-called ‘subjective’ and ‘ objec- 
tive ’ conditions and results, of the experiment.

  viii FOREWORD TO THE STUDENT 
Provide yourself with a notebook containing detachable sheets 
of cross-section paper divided into one half centimeter squares. 
Write only on one side. It is suggested that the experiments be 
arranged in the notebook in the following manner: —

FOREWORD TO THE STUDENT ix 
Place the questions on a separate sheet. The method of the 
experiment should be described in your own language and with 
such completeness that any one reading your notebook would 
know how the experiment had been performed. Any peculiar con- 
ditions of the experiment, such as a headache of the subject, should 
be noted. The subject will have to obtain the records for his note- 
book from the experimenter. 
Before starting an experiment, always read the entire descrip- 
tion including the questions. 
In order the better to understand the methods and results, as 
well as to obtain knowledge of further experiments, the following 
books are suggested: E. B. Titchener’s Experimental Psychology, 
G. M. Whipple’s Manual of Mental and Physical Tests, C. E. Sea- 
shore’s Elementary Experiments in Psychology, and E. C. San- 
ford’s A Course in Experimental Psychology. 
Answer the questions fully, giving them careful thought. You 
will be well repaid for the time spent upon them by the better in- 
sight you will obtain into the purpose and implications of the 
experiment. The following books will aid you in answering the 
questions: For the physiological facts, C. J. Herrick’s An Intro- 
duction to Neurology, K. Dunlap’s An Outline of Psychobiology, 
E. A. Schaefer’s A Textbook of Physiology, W. H. Howell’s Text- 
book of Physiology ; for the facts and theories of psychology, G. T. 
Ladd and R. S. Woodworth’s Elements of Physiological Psychology, 
C.S.Myers’s A Textbook of Experimental Psychology, E. B. Titch- 
ener’s A Textbook of Psychology, H. Miinsterberg’s Psychology, 
General and Applied, J. R. Angell’s Psychology, J. B. Watson’s 
Psychology from the Standpoint of a Behaviorist, and H.C. Warren’s 
Human Psychology.

of the left eye and the colored disc in front of the right. Close 
the left eye and fixate the black dot with the right. Move the card 
toward you and away from you, still keeping the right eye fixated 
on the black dot, until the colored disc disappears. Note the 
appearance of the background after the disc has disappeared. 
Repeat, using each of the other cards. 
Record: (1) For card no. 1: State the approximate distance from 
the eye at which the disc disappears. 
(2) For cards nos. 2, 3, and 4: Present drawings and descriptions 
indicating the appearance of the background with special reference 
to that part from which the disc has disappeared. 
(3) For card no. 2: Describe any change in size which may occur 
in the yellow background. 
(4) State whether the disc can be made to disappear only at a 
certain point, or whether it remains blotted out during a certain 
movement of the card toward you and away from you. If the 
latter, record the extent of this movement in inches. 
Be careful to keep the eye fixated on the black dot. 
Questions: 1. Describe a method suggested by the results of 
this experiment for ascertaining the size of the blind spot. 
2. Explain a possible method for mapping out the shape of the 
blind spot. 
3. Give at least two reasons why we are not conscious of the 
blind spot in reading.

  RETINAL INDUCTION 3 
2. Retinal Induction (Simultaneous Contrast) : (2) 
(Individual experiment) 
Materials: Two one-inch squares of the same medium gray paper. 
Three-inch squares of black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow 
paper. A six-inch square of white tissue paper. 
Method: A. Brightness Induction. — Place the black and the 
white squares side by side, and on each, one of the gray squares. 
Cover these with the tissue paper. Note the change in the relative 
brightness of the two grays. 
B. Color Induction. — Place a gray square on the red square and 
cover with tissue. Note the change which occurs in the gray square. 
Repeat, using the other colors. 
Record: Write a description of the changes which occurred in the 
gray under the different conditions. 
Questions: 1. Give a physiological explanation of retinal induction. 
2. How may the phenomenon of retinal induction be made to 
serve esthetic purposes? 
3. Describe instances of retinal induction which have occurred 
in your observation of nature.

3. Negative After Images (3) 
Materials: Three pieces of cardboard six inches square: — black, 
white, and medium gray. A two-inch square of black paper. One- 
inch squares of the following colors: — white, red, green, blue, 
yellow, and violet. 
Method: The experimenter places the square of black paper on 
the gray card and the square of white paper on the black paper. 
The subject fixates the middle of the white square for fifteen 
seconds. The black and white paper squares are then quickly re- 
moved while the subject holds his fixation point constant. He notes 
the quality of the resulting after image. The after image may not 
appear at once; the subject should continue to fixate until it appears. 
With a slight amount of practice it will be readily observed. 
Repeat this procedure, using the black and white cards in turn 
as backgrounds, i.e., in place of the gray card. 
Now proceed as before with the red square, placing it in turn on 
each of the three backgrounds. Treat each of the other colors in 
the same manner. The large black square of paper is not used in 
connection with the colors. The subject observes the changes in 
hue. He notes also the differences in brightness and saturation 
(amount of color) of the after images on the three backgrounds, 
expressing the degrees of brightness and saturation separately on 
an arbitrary scale of one (least) to three (greatest). Temporal as- 
pects such as duration and intermittent appearance of the after 
image are also to be observed. 
Record: (1) For black and white. (a) Give a comparison of the 
after image obtained in the first procedure, with the original paper 
squares. (b) Compare also the three after images on the three dif- 
ferent backgrounds in regard to differences of brightness. (c) De- 
scribe the effect of the movement of the eyes on the after image. 
(2) For colors. The results should be tabulated as shown in the 
table. 
Questions: 1. Was there a fringe of color or brightness about 
the paper squares? If so, describe and explain it.

4. Retinal Color Fusion (Method of Positive After Image) (4) 
Materials: Color-wheel.! Discs of red, green, blue, yellow, violet, 
and orange. Measuring disc graduated in degrees. 
Method: (1) The experimenter places a blue and a yellow disc in- 
terlapped on the color-wheel. He regulates the amounts of each 
until on turning the wheel a smooth pure gray is obtained. The 
wheel must be revolved with sufficient rapidity to eliminate flicker. 
The subject indicates when the desired gray has been attained. 
Measure the amount of each color in degrees. Repeat, using red and 
green. 
A pure gray will not result from the red and green. An addition 
of blue will, therefore, be needed. 
Find the hues and their proportions which are necessary to add 
to violet and to orange respectively in order to produce gray. 
(2) Determine the result of mixing blue and green, and of mix- 
ing blue and red. : { 
Record: For 1. (a) Tabulate the proportions of colors necessary 
in each case to produce gray. (6) State the hues and their propor- 
tions which can be said to be “‘ complementary ” to orange and to 
violet respectively. 
For 2. Name the hues resulting from the mixture of the colors 
given. [The pairs used in (2) are called “ non-complementaries.”’] 
Questions: 1. From the results of your experiment formulate 
the laws of retinal color fusion. 
2. Why do the colors fuse when the wheel is revolved? 
1 The Milton-Bradley color tops and paper discs may be used instead of the 
color-wheel.

5. Retinal Color Fusion (Method of Negative After Image) (5) 
(Individual experiment) 
Materials: One-inch paper squares of red, green, blue, yellow, 
black, and white. Background of medium gray cardboard. 
Method: (1) Place the red square on the gray background and 
fixate its center for fifteen seconds. Fixate immediately thereafter 
the upper right-hand corner of the red square. Note the changes 
which may occur in any part of the colored square, or in the back- 
ground. Proceed in the same manner, using each of the other colors 
and also the black and white. 
(2) Now fixate the red on the gray background for twenty sec- 
onds. Remove it quickly and place a blue square in its place, fixat- 
ing the upper right-hand corner. Note the changes which occur in 
the blue square. Repeat, using a blue and then a green square in 
the same manner. Make one more trial, using a red and then a 
yellow. 
Record: Sketch and describe what you see for each of the six 
after images in part 1, and in the three observations in part 2. 
Questions: 1. Do the results of this experiment confirm the 
laws of color fusion you gave in the last experiment? If so, how? 
2, Explain the difference in principle between this experiment 
and the preceding? E

6. Relation of Brightness to Retinal Fusion (6) 
Materials: Color-wheel.! Discs of black, white, red, green, blue, 
and yellow. Measuring disc. 
Method: The experimenter places a black and a white disc in- 
terlapped on the color-wheel in such a way that 180° of each is ex- 
posed. Revolve the wheel at a rate that is just sufficient to elimi- 
nate all flicker. Count the number of revolutions of the handle of 
the instrument at this rate for ten seconds, and compute the aver- 
age number per second. Repeat the experiment, using in turn the 
following pairs of colors: red-blue, green-blue, yellow-green, and 
yellow-red. 
Record: Tabulate the rate required for fusion in the case of black 
and white, and for the different color pairs respectively. 
Questions: 1. From your results what law can you formulate con- 
cerning the relation between brightness difference and the rate of 
revolution required for fusion? 
2. It is difficult accurately to compare two colors in regard to 
brightness. This is owing to the difference in hue. Describe an 
indirect method of making such a comparison, using this experi- 
ment as a basis. 
3. At a low rate of speed of the wheel you observed a rough flicker. 
Why was it necessary to increase the speed in order to produce a 
smooth surface? 
*24 Does the center of the wheel fuse at a slower rate of revolu- 
tion than the periphery? If so, explain why. 
1 Tf only one color-wheel is available, this may be performed as a class experi- 
ment in which the instructor operates the instrument and the class judges when the 
flicker disappears. 
2 Especially difficult questions are starred, to be omitted at the discretion of the 
instructor.

COLOR ZONES OF THE RETINA 9 
7. Color Zones of the Retina (7) 
Materials: Perimeter. Small squares of red, green, blue, and 
yellow paper. 
Method: While making the judgments required in this experiment 
the subject rests his chin on the chin-rest of the perimeter, closes his 
left eye, and with the right fixates the white fixation point. The 
right eye is used throughout. With the perimeter arc in the horizon- 
tal position the experimenter places a square of red in the holder 
and starting at the extreme right end of the arc moves the holder 
gradually toward the center until the paper square is seen by the 
subject. Note down this point in degrees. Continue to move the 
holder toward the center until the paper is seen as red. Make a note 
of any color changes which occur before the red is seen. Note 
down the degree at which the color is first seen as red. 
Next starting from the center move the holder outward toward 
the right until the red disappears — either turning to gray or ap- 
pearing as some other color. Note the degree at which the red dis- 
appears. Continue moving outward and note the degree at which 
the paper itself disappears. At no time should the subject’s eye 
leave the central fixation point. 
Repeat the procedure, moving out and in on the left side of the 
perimeter arc. 
Now adjust the arc in a vertical position and make correspond- 
ing measurements going in and out in the half above the fixation 
point, and the same in the half below the fixation point. Sixteen 
measurements will now have been obtained. 
The same method is followed for each of the other colors, omit- 
ting however the measurement of the points at which the paper 
itself disappears, and noting only the degrees at which the color 
appears or disappears. For record, etc., see below.

Simplified method 
Materials: A sheet of white cardboard approximately 14 x 24 
inches. Colored paper squares as in the foregoing method. Ruler. 
Method: Place the cardboard with the long edge horizontal to 
the subject. Draw two lines, one bisecting the card vertically, the 
other bisecting it horizontally, and place a dot at their intersection. 
The subject leans well over the paper resting his chin on his two 
fists, one of which is placed on top of the other. His left eye should 
be closed and his right eye directly over the black dot, which he 
fixates during the various trials. 
The experimenter moves the colors severally in and out in the 
four directions indicated by the intersecting lines. That is, the colors 
are to be moved along the lines on the right, on the left, above, and 
below the fixation point respectively. , 
The procedure to be used was described under the foregoing 
method. Place small marks at the points where the subject re- 
ports the various changes in the colors. Rests are to be allowed to 
offset fatigue. 
Record: (x) Tabulate the measurements according to the table 
given below. [It should be borne in mind that since the rays of light 
cross after entering the eye, a point to the right of the fixation point 
will fall on the left or nasal half of the retina of the right eye; and a

point to the left of the fixation point will fall on the right or tem- 
poral half. Similarly the lower part of the perimeter (or card- 
board) will correspond to the superior half of the retina, and 
the upper part to the inferior half.] If the perimeter is used, the 
results. will be recorded in degrees. If the simplified method is used 
the distances will be expressed as centimeters measured from the 
central dot. 
(2) Express as centimeters the degrees of the average measure- 
ments in the four directions for each of the four colors and for the 
limits of the visual field. For example, ten degrees are represented 
graphically as ten centimeters. Lay out these numbers in a con- 
venient scale on a map representing the horizontal and vertical axes. 
If the simplified method was used the results will be already in 
centimeters, but will probably require reduction to a convenient 
scale. Connect the points which you have laid out for the several 
colors by means of curves, as shown in figure 2. Indicate which 
color zone each curve circumscribes. It is possible that the curves 
you obtain may cross each other.

  BINOCULAR INHIBITION AND FUSION 13 
8. Binocular Inhibition and Fusion (8) 
Materials: Stereoscope.! Piece of cardboard cut to fit the holder 
of the stereoscope. Squares of red, green, blue, yellow, white, and 
black, cut one half the size of the cardboard so that one can be 
placed in each field of vision. Two pieces of white cardboard cut 
the same size as the paper squares, each bisected by a black stripe 
one quarter inch in width. 
Method: Place the two striped cardboards in the stereoscope, one 
with the stripe horizontal, the other with the stripe vertical. The 
subject looks through the stereoscope and notes the changes which 
occur for one minute. The larger piece of cardboard may be used in 
this and the following steps for a supporting background. 
Place the following pairs of colors in turn in the stereoscope, 
with a separate color for each eye: red-green, blue-yellow, red- 
yellow, black-white. The subject observes each pair for one 
minute. 
Record: Present in tabular form a report of the occurrence of the 
following possible phenomena for each pair. 
x. Number of times the image of the right eye was inhibited. 
2. Number of times the image of the left eye was inhibited. 
3. Approximate length of time both images were seen occupy- 
ing the same space. Record accurately the different ways in 
which this combined image appeared. In the case of the black 
stripes note especially what is seen at the place where the stripes 
cross.

lowing points: 
(a) The bearing of the complementary relation of colors on the 
rate of alternation. 
(b) The bearing of the brightness relation of colors on the rate of 
alternation. 
1 If stereoscopes are not available the phenomena of inhibition and fusion of colors 
may be observed by placing pieces of colored glass close to the eyes. Put one color (as 
indicated in the method) close in front of one eye, and the other color in front of the 
other eye.

  ABSOLUTE THRESHOLD FOR COLOR 15 
9. Absolute Threshold for Color (9) 
Materials: Color-wheel.! Large discs of white, red, yellow, blue, 
and green. Small disc of white. Measuring disc. 
Method: The purpose of this experiment is to find the least 
amount of color that can be seen. The experimenter places a red 
disc and the large white disc interlapped upon the color-wheel, and 
upon these the small white disc. Arrange the large discs so that a 
very small amount (about one half of a degree) of red is exposed. 
Revolve the wheel at a rate sufficient to produce a uniform surface. 
The subject reports whether he sees a difference in hue (color) be- 
tween the inner and the outer discs. If no difference is observed, 
slightly increase the amount of red and repeat. Continue this pro- 
cedure until the subject, by comparing the inner and outer discs 
as they revolve, can detect the presence of red in the outer disc. 
Measure in degrees the amount of red required. 
Now add an amount of red sufficient to make the hues of the two 
discs plainly different. Decrease the red until the subject reports 
that the two discs seem identical. Measure the amount of red 
which remains exposed. 
Repeat each procedure five times. 
The threshold is now found in a similar manner for the other 
three colors. 
Record: For each color the averages of the five trials with in- 
creasing color, and the five trials with decreasing color are taken 
separately. The average of these two averages then gives the abso- 
lute threshold for the color used.

a. Lower Threshold for Sound (10) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Watch. Measuring tape. 
Method: The subject sits erect in a straight-backed chair and 
keeps his head in a constant position throughout the experiment. 
Beginning one foot from his left ear move the watch very slowly 
and noiselessly away until the subject no longer hears its ticking. 
The distance of the watch from the ear is then measured. 
The watch is then held five feet beyond this point and moved 
slowly and noiselessly nearer until the subject hears it. The dis- 
tance is again measured. Repeat these two procedures, using the 
other ear. In all trials the ear not used should be closed. 
Care should be taken to keep the face of the watch turned 
squarely toward the subject’s ear. After the threshold is obtained, 
hold the watch still at a point slightly within the threshold. The 
subject notes whether he hears any fluctuations in the intensity 
of the sound. The experiment should be performed on as many 
members of the class as time will permit. 
Record: (a) Present in tabular form the “in” and “ out” thresh- 
olds and their average for each ear, and for the different subjects 
chosen. 
(6) Give a rough estimation of the time and period of the fluctua- 
tions of intensity, together with a statement of whether this rate 
seems to be correlated with the rate of the subject’s respiration.

range of normal individual variability in the lower threshold for 
sound? 
2. What are the possible causes for the fluctuations in intensity 
which you observed? 
3. Would you call the tick of a watch a tone, or a noise, or both? 
Give several examples of auditory perceptions commonly called 
“noise,” but in which tones are distinguishable.

2. Differential Threshold for Pitch (12) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Two tuning forks of the same pitch, set on resonance 
boxes. Rubber hammer. Beeswax. Small cardboard screen. 
Watch with second hand. 
Method: The tuning forks are concealed from the class behind 
the screen. The experimenter strikes the two forks successively 
to familiarize the subjects with their quality. The subjects note 
that the forks are of equal pitch. The experimenter then places 
a very small piece of wax on one prong of one of the forks near the 
top. The forks are again struck successively with equal intensity, 
and the students indicate by show of hands: (1) the number of sub- 
jects who judged the two sounds equal in pitch; (2) the number who 
judged the second sound lower; and (3) the number who judged the 
second sound higher. Small quantities of wax are added as required, 
thus further lowering the pitch, until, when the forks are struck 
successively, seventy per cent of the subjects give the correct judg- 
ment as to the difference in pitch of the forks. 
Sometimes the loaded fork is struck first, and sometimes the 
other, in no regular order. In all the trials the first fork is allowed 
to sound for two seconds, and then dampened by placing the hand 
over the prongs.! Then after an interval of two seconds the 
other fork is struck and allowed to vibrate for the same length 
of time. 
After the seventy per cent of correct judgments have been given 
the forks are struck in quick succession without dampening. They 
will then beat: that is, there will be a rising and falling in the inten- 
sity of the sound. The number of these beats per second depends 
upon the difference in number of vibrations per second between 
the forks. For example, five beats per second indicates a difference 
in pitch of five vibrations per second. 
In order to find the threshold of difference for pitch the beats are 
1 To prevent rusting the steel avoid touching the fork with the bare hand. It is ad- 
visable to wear a glove or hold a cloth in the hand.

DIFFERENTIAL THRESHOLD FOR PITCH 19 
counted for five seconds by the class. The count of ten members 
of the class is taken. 
The variable fork is now weighted sufficiently to produce more 
than the just noticeable difference in pitch, and the forks struck 
as at the beginning. The wax is then diminished until less than 
seventy per cent of the class give correct judgments as to the differ- 
ence in pitch. When this point is reached the beats are counted as 
before. 
If time permits, the threshold can be found using forks of con- 
siderably higher or lower pitch than those used in this experiment. 
These thresholds at the different pitches can then be compared with 
the results obtained later under XI (‘‘ The Psychophysical Law”’). 
Record: Tabulate the beat counts of the ten members of the class 
for five seconds and take the average. Divide this again by five to 
obtain the average number of beats per second. 
This is to be done separately for the two procedures, one of rais- 
ing, and the other of lowering, the variable fork. The final average 
is then taken. This average is the threshold for difference in pitch 
at the pitch of the forks used. 
Questions: 1. What individual factors can you think of which 
might influence the threshold for pitch difference? 
2. What analysis can you give from your introspection of the 
method of comparison by which you judged the equality and differ- 
ence of the two tones?

*13, Tonal Fusion - (12) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Pianoforte or organ; or two sets of tuning forks each 
set consisting of a root, major second, major third, fourth, fifth, 
major seventh, and octave. For example, such a set might com- 
prise the tones c, d, e, f, g, b, and ¢ (octave). If tuning forks are 
used, they should be hidden by a screen from the subjects. Two 
rubber hammers are required for striking the forks. 
Method: The experimenter strikes the various intervals in such a 
way that the class cannot see the operation. The students indicate 
by show of hands those who can distinguish the two tones of the 
chord. The judgment should be made, not as to whether it sounds 
like an interval, but as to whether the two tones are heard as dis- 
tinct. Occasionally the experimenter strikes only one tone, but 
somewhat louder, as a test of the reliability of the judgments. The 
number of students who do not hear the two tones as separate, in 
other words, who experience complete fusion, is noted down after 
each interval. The intervals are given in irregular order, repeating 
until each has been sounded five times. 
Care should be taken to strike the two notes of the interval with 
equal force. If pairs of forks are used they must be sounded simul- 
taneously with the two hammers. They should rest on fairly firm 
bases.

4. Binaural Pitch Difference (13) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Two tuning forks of equal pitch, such as C2 or Ay. 
Beeswax. Rubber hammer. 
Method: The subject sits in a chair and closes his eyes. The ex- 
perimenter has an assistant hold the two forks opposite and close 
to the two ears of the subject at equal distances. He then strikes 
one of the forks and after three seconds dampens it by placing his 
hand across the top of the two prongs, The other ear is closed. 
The tuning forks are to be held with their prongs parallel to the 
side of the head. Immediately after dampening the first fork, the 
experimenter strikes the other with as nearly as possible the same 
force, and dampens it after three seconds. The subject judges 
whether the two forks seem of equal or of different pitch. This is 
repeated until there is no doubt of the correctness of the judgment. 
Repeat this preliminary experiment on as many members of 
the class as time allows. 
Now select the subject who notices most decidedly a differ- 
ence. Strike the tuning forks as before, the subject indicating 
which sounds the higher. Place a small piece of wax on one of the 
prongs of this fork near the top. The forks are now sounded again 
and the judgment given. If the altered fork still sounds higher to 
the subject, add more wax; if lower, remove a small amount, 
until the two forks seem of equal pitch. 
It is now necessary to find the objective pitch difference of the 
forks. The experimenter sounds them together and the class counts 
the beats for five seconds, starting at an even second mark. The 
counts obtained by five members of the class are taken and 
averaged. 
Record: (a) Present a table of the subjects experimented upon 
indicating whether their two ears were of the same or different 
pitch.

five seconds, the average of these five counts, and finally the aver-

Questions: *1. What fraction of a musical whole tone (major 
second) does this pitch difference represent? Compute this from 
the vibration rate of the unloaded fork, and the rate of its major 
second which may be obtained by using the ratio given in the pre- 
ceding experiment. [C2 has 528 v. per second. A; has 440.] 
2. Judging from what you have already done in obtaining thresh- 
olds of sensation, would you say that this method for measuring 
the pitch difference is complete? If not, how would you proceed 
further? 
3. How may the esthetic pleasure of the subject be affected by 
his binaural pitch difference? Are all individuals having pitch dif- 
ference thus affected? If not, why?

1. Exhaustion and Recuperation (24) 
Materials: Small bottles of tincture of iodine and spirits of cam- 
phor. Watch with second hand. Wide bottles should be used so 
that about one square inch of the liquid surface is exposed. 
Method: The subject holds one nostril closed and, holding the 
bottle of iodine about a quarter of an inch from the other nostril, 
inhales evenly and rapidly and exhales through the mouth. Con- 
tinue until the odor can no longer be smelled. The experimenter 
notes the time required for this exhaustion. A thirty second rest 
period is now allowed with both nostrils open. The subject then 
smells the odor as before through the same nostril until the organ 
is again completely exhausted. The time is again noted. Continue 
this process of exhaustion and recuperation until no odor can be 
detected after the half minute rest period. 
Using the other nostril, repeat the eee with spirits of 
camphor. 
Record: Tabulate the series of successive exhaustion times for 
camphor, and the series for iodine.

oil of camphor, eau de cologne, oil of turpentine, oil of lavender, oil 
of bergamot, or any other compound odors which yield different 
olfactory qualities if smelled for some time. A watch with second 
hand. 
Method: The subject smells the odor until the nostril used is com- 
pletely exhausted, and notices any changes which occur in the 
quality of the odor. The experimenter notes down these qualities 
and takes the time at which the changes occur. Repeat the ex- 
periment, using the other two odors.

Method: With one nostril closed, the subject smells successively 
of the last five odors (as named above) and estimates the intensity 
of each one separately on a subjective scale of five, — one being the 
lowest in intensity, five the highest. A general idea of the range of 
this scale should be obtained by smelling each of the odors briefly 
with one nostril before beginning the experiment. The estimation 
of the five odors is made three times. 
The subject now exhausts the same nostril for iodine, and smells 
the five odors again in the same order, estimating their intensities in 
three trials as before. 
Repeat the experiment with the other nostril, using spirits of 
camphor for the exhausting odor.

HAND glass locate any hairs within the 
stamped area, and after indicating 
their location on each of the three 
notebook maps by crosses, cut them 
away close to the skin. 
Select a bristle of such length and 
thickness that when applied verti- 
cally to the skin, it will just give a 
touch sensation. If the end is split, it 
must be cut off squarely. By means 
  P= a . eee os of sealing wax fasten the thicker end 
ee of the bristle to the blunt end of the 
Se i skewer in such a way that the bristle 
and skewer form a right angle. 
With eyes closed the subject rests the forearm, palmar side up, 
comfortably on the table. The experimenter touches the dots 
lightly and with uniform pressure, holding the bristle in a position

vertical to the skin. He explores the map, starting at the radial 
end of the most proximal row of dots, and taking the rows succes- 
sively, beginning always at the radial side. Allow about two sec- 
onds between successive stimulations. Whenever the subject feels 
a touch sensation he gives a signal. Locate these ‘touch spots’ 
on the first of the three notebook maps, using a circle to signify 
the usual touch sensations and a square to denote those which 
are especially vivid. 
This procedure is repeated, the experimenter moving from prox- 
imal to distal on each row and taking the rows successively from 
the radial to the ulnar side. Locate the spots found in the second 
map. The experimenter should exercise care not to touch the sub- 
-ject’s hand with his own while stimulating the dots. 
The student must understand that the method of stimulating 
only dots is purely arbitrary and for convenience. It is possible 
that there are touch organs between these dots, so that the number 
of touch organs located is only an approximation. 
Record: Present the two maps already described, and a third 
map on which should be indicated by small triangles the verified 
touch spots, that is, those which yielded touch sensations in each 
of the two previous maps. 
Figure 5 shows the arrangement of the three maps (for the right 
forearm) together with a sample record. The arrow indicates the 
direction of stimulation.

basis of touch? 
4. What biological reason can you give for the fact that touch 
spots are more numerous on mobile extremities of the body than 
elsewhere?

2. After Image (x9) 
Materials: A wooden skewer. “Watch with second hand. 
Method: The experimenter taps the subject’s forehead smartly 
with the blunt end of the skewer. The subject attends to the throbs 
or resurgences which follow the first touch sensation. These are the 
so-called after images. Their number, quality, and total duration 
are noted. 
Record: (1) State the total time of the duration of the series of 
after images, and the rate (approximately) of their recurrence. 
(2) Give a comparison of the intensity, spacial extent, and dura- 
tion of the succeeding after images with these aspects of the original 
sensation. State also any other qualitative differences that may 
be noticed. 
Questions: *t. What explanation can you offer for this intermit- 
tent after-sensation? 
2. Where have you previously noticed such intermittent sensory 
phenomena?

EXHAUSTION 33 
3. Exhaustion (20) 
Materials: Skewer with bristle attached as in the first touch ex- 
periment. 
Method: The experimenter explores the back of the subject’s 
hand with the bristle until a well-defined and rather isolated touch 
spot is found. It should not be too near a hair. This spot is then 
enclosed with an ink circle about one millimeter in diameter. The 
subject closes his eyes, and the experimenter touches the spot 
squarely and rhythmically with equal pressure, and rapidly enough 
to prevent recovery of the end organ between stimulations. This 
is continued until the subject no longer feels a touch sensation. The 
number of touches required is noted. Be careful always to touch 
the exact center of the circle. 
Record: (1) State the number of stimulations many! to ex- 
haust the touch organ. 
(2) Write a general description of any changes in intensity which 
the subject experienced during the stimulation. 
Questions: 1. How do you explain any fluctuations in inten- 
sity which you may have noticed? 
2. What possible sources of error can you point out in your ex- 
periment?

4. Adaptation (21) 
Materials: Two equal weights of about 50 grams. A lighter 
weight of about 15 grams, and a heavier weight of about 100 grams. 
The materials of experiment XI, 2, may very well be used in this 
experiment. 
Method: The subject closes his eyes and extends his two hands 
palms up on the table. The experimenter places the two equal 
weights simultaneously on the hands of the subject, who notes that 
they appear equal in weight. The two unequal weights (light and 
heavy) are then placed simultaneously, one on each palm. They 
are raised and lowered by the experimenter on the same spot of 
their respective hands twenty-five times. 
The experimenter now quickly replaces the two equal weights, 
one on each palm. The subject indicates whether they still seem 
equal. 
Record: Give a comparison of the feeling of the two equal 
weights before and after the application of the unequal weights. 
Questions: 1. What effect does adaptation to pressure have on 
the estimation of a weight? 
*2. What is a possible physiological basis of this change in judg- 
ment? 
3. Give several examples of the effect of adaptation upon the 
judgment of the stimulus.

VI. WARMTH 
1. Location of Warm End Organs (22) 
Materials: Metal rods about six inches in length with points 
which are slightly rounded. These rods can be made from round 
brass rod five thirty-seconds of an inch in diameter. Tumblers. 
Very soft pencil. Facilities for heating water. 
Method: The rods are to be kept in a glass of very hot water 
which should be repeatedly renewed as it cools. Preliminarily to 
the experiment, the experimenter touches the subject’s forearm in 
different places with the point of the heated rod, in order to enable 
the subject to distinguish between the sensations of warmth, heat, 
and pain. 
The subject’s arm is now extended palm up with the fingers 
toward the experimenter. With the aid of a ruler and a very soft 
and fairly sharp-pointed pencil a line six inches long is drawn 
lengthwise on the palmar surface of the subject’s forearm. With 
the point of a heated rod the experimenter stimulates the skin along 
the line in the distal direction by making successive applications 
about one millimeter apart and with an interval of two seconds 
between stimulations. 
The subject indicates when he feels sensations of warmth or heat, 
and the experimenter marks the exact location of these sensitive 
spots by small dots along the line. Place the dots for warm sensa- 
tions on the right, and those for heat on the left of the line. Spots 
yielding cold sensations should be especially designated. This last 
is known as ‘paradoxical cold sensation.’ 
Throughout the experiment the rods should be kept warm 
enough to give a temperature sensation when applied lightly to the 
skin, but not so hot as to produce the sensations of burning or pain. 
Always see that the point of the rod is dry before touching it to the 
skin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  36 WARMTH 
| Repeat the experiment, stimulating ‘the line in the proximal di- 
rection, and marking the spots that give temperature sensations as 
before. This time place the dots a little further out from the line 
so they will not be confused with the row already made. ' 
Record: (1) Transfer the line with the rows of dots to the note- 
book, indicating with arrows the directions of stimulation of the 
rows, and designating the proximal and distal ends. 
(2) Make a second line in the notebook, putting in those tempera- 
ture spots which were found to coincide when working in the two 
directions. Almost identical spots may be considered as coinciding. 
Questions: 1. Were any sensations of cold experienced? How 
would you explain cold sensations obtained in this experiment? 
2. Judging from your introspection, is the sensation of heat a 
more intense warmth sensation, ora fusion of different qualities? 
If the latter, what qualities?
-P-A-G-E-55
  LOCAL VARIATIONS IN SENSITIVITY 37 
2. Local Variations in Sensitivity (23) 
Materials: Metal rods and hot water as in the preceding ex- 
periment. 
Method: With the blunt end of the heated rod the experimenter 
stimulates the subject’s palm and the back of his hand in such 
quick succession that the rod will not have time to cool between the 
two stimulations. Heating the rod as before, stimulate in quick suc- 
cession the palm and the center of the forehead; then the center and 
side of the forehead; then the nose and chin. The subject indicates 
the intensity of each sensation on a scale of one to five. 
Record: Tabulate the degree of intensity of the warmth sensa- 
tion for each location, arranging the regions stimulated in decreas- 
ing order of their sensitivity. 
Questions: 1. How do you explain the fact that the same in- 
tensity of stimulus feels warmer in one place than in another? 
2. What ordinary experiences relate to the facts of this experi- 
ment?
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 WARMTH 
3. Adaptation (24) 
Materials: Tumblers of hot, cold, and lukewarm water. A sup- 
ply of hot water. 
Method: The subject holds the right index finger in the cold 
water and the left index finger in the hot water simultaneously 
for two minutes. He observes the change in the temperature sensa- 
tions of the two fingers during two minutes’ adaptation. He then 
places the two index fingers quickly in the lukewarm water and 
notes the difference in the temperature sensations of the two fingers. 
Repeat the experiment, using the right and left middle fingers, 
but holding them in the hot and cold water this time for only one 
minute. The time is kept by the experimenter. 
Record: (1) Describe and compare the changes in temperature 
sensations as the right and left index fingers become adapted to the 
hot and cold water. 
(2) Describe the temperature sensations experienced by the two 
index fingers when placed in the lukewarm water. 
(3) Compare approximately the effect of the one-minute with 
that of the two-minute period of adaptation when the fingers were 
placed in the lukewarm water. State whether the increase in con- 
trast seemed proportional to the increase in length of adaptation. 
Questions: 1. Why do we call this experiment adaptation rather 
than exhaustion? 
2. Compare this phenomenon to a similar one we have studied, 
showing the similarity and the difference. 
3. Give several examples of adaptation to warmth in everyday 
life.
-P-A-G-E-57
VII. COLD 
1. Location of Cold End Organs (25) 
Materials: Metal rods. Tumbler of ice water. Ruler. Soft 
pencil. 
Method: Using rods cooled in the ice water follow the same pro- 
cedure as in the location of warmth end organs (VI, 1). The line 
should be as nearly as possible identical with the line used in that 
experiment. Use one side of the line to locate the cold spots for the 
distal direction of stimulation, and the other side for the proximal. 
Unusually vivid cold spots and spots giving paradoxical warmth 
sensations (that is, a warmth sensation arising from a cold stimu- 
lation) should be especially designated. 
Record: Transfer the line to the notebook and make a verifica- 
tion line, as in the experiment in warmth. 
Questions: 1. What is the ratio of warmth to cold spots in the 
region you have investigated? 
2. What are the probable sources of error in this experiment? 
! 3. Give an explanation for any especially vivid cold sensations 
you may have found. 
4. Do your results in the last few experiments support the theory 
that heat is a combination of warmth and cold? 
5. From your introspection compare the qualities of warmth and 
cold.

2. After Image (26) 
Materials: Pennies. Tumbler of ice water. 
Method: The experimenter cools a coin in the ice water, and then 
dries it thoroughly and holds it for three seconds against the 
subject’s forehead. The subject attends to the resurgences which 
follow the first cold sensation. The number, quality, and total 
duration of these after images are noted. Care should be taken to 
distinguish between the after images of cold and touch. 
Record: (x) State the total time of the duration of the series of 
after images, and the rate of their recurrence. 
(2) Compare the intensity, spacial extent, and duration of the 
succeeding after images with these aspects of the original sensation. 
Describe any other qualitative differences which may be noticed. 
Questions: 1. How does the relation of intensity of after image 
to intensity of sensation in this eaeeireye cope with that in 
the after image of touch?: = 4 
2. Although the coin is thoroughly dry the after image is often 
described as wet. How do you account for this? ©

INHIBITION OF COLD AND WARMTH 41 
3. Inhibition of Cold and Warmth (27) 
Materials: Metal rods. Tumblers of hot and cold water. | 
Method: A. Successive. Stimulate the back of the subject’s hand 
with a cold rod, and three seconds afterward with a heated rod at a 
distance of about six centimeters (two and one half inches) from 
the first stimulation. Note the effect of the second stimulus. Re- 
peat, reversing the order of cold and warmth stimulations. 
B. Simultaneous. Apply the warm and cold stimuli at the same 
time and at a distance of about six centimeters. The subject ob- 
serves the resulting sensation. 
Record: For A, state the effect of the one stimulation on the sen- 
sation from the other. For B, describe the sensation which results 
from the simultaneous stimulation of warmth and cold. 
Questions: 1. In A, if the last stimulation always inhibits the 
first, what is the reason? 
2. In B is there a tendency for one temperature sensation to in- 
hibit the other? If so, how do you account for it? 
*3. In B what would you have said, a priori, were all the possi- 
ble results of such simultaneous stimulation? 
4. How do you explain inhibition in the temperature senses?

4. Latent Period (28) 
Materials: Metal rods. Needle. Tumblers of hot and cold water. 
Method: With a cooled metal rod the experimenter finds a well- 
defined cold spot on the subject’s hand. As he stimulates it the 
subject notices, with closed eyes, whether touch or cold is felt first. 
Similarly, with a heated rod find whether touch or warmth 
appears first; and with a needle whether touch or pain. The 
subject observes also the latent periods of warmth, cold, and pain 
as compared with each other. [Latent period is that time which 
elapses between a stimulation and the resulting sensation.] 
Record: (x) State the comparison of the latent period of touch 
with the other three senses separately. 
(2) Arrange warmth, cold, pain, and touch as accurately as you 
can in decreasing order of the length of their respective latent 
periods. 
Questions: 1. How do you account for these differences in latent 
period? 
2. Do we commonly notice these dual sensations resulting from 
single stimulations in ordinary experience? If not, why?
-P-A-G-E-61
VIII. PAIN 
1. Location of Pain End Organs (29) 
Materials: Needles. Rubber stamp and ink pad as in the exper- 
iment on location of touch spots (V, 1). = 
Method: Make an impression of the stamp on the under side of the 
subject’s forearm and stimulate the dots in the same manner as you 
did in the location of touch end organs, except that a sterilized 
needle is used instead of a bristle. The experimenter must make 
sure that the point of the needle has not been blunted. The needle 
is applied slantingly to the skin and with sufficient pressure to in- 
dent the skin but not to pierce it. 
Record: The spots sensitive to pain are to be given on three 
maps in a manner similar to that for touch end organs. 
Questions: 1. In this experiment does the sensation of pain ever 
occur without that of touch? What are the possible explanations? 
2. From an introspective analysis tell how a pain sensation 
differs from a touch sensation. 
3. How does the numerical ratio of touch and pain end organs 
as found in your experiment compare with the ratio as reported in 
the literature? How can you account for any disagreement you 
may find?

  " IX. LABYRINTHINE SENSE : 
1. Sensations of Bodily Rotation : (30) 
Method: The subject with eyes closed revolves six or eight times 
on the ball of his foot, gradually increasing and then gradually de- 
creasing his speed. He observes any change in the apparent direc- 
tion of movement during and after rotation. This is repeated with 
eyes open, and the experimenter notes the eye movements of the 
subject during and after rotation. [The eye moves slowly in one 
direction and jerks back quickly.] The subject takes note of the 
directions in which he and the surroundings seem to move during 
and after rotation. 
The rotation is again repeated with the eyes open, the subject 
fixating the eyes at the end of their slow movement, thus inhibiting 
the quick forward movement (which alone can be inhibited). Note 
that there is no sensation of dizziness. 
Record: State in tabular form: 
(1) The various apparent directions of rotation with eyes closed. 
(2) The various apparent directions of rotation and movement 
of the surroundings with eyes open. 
(3) The eye movements during and after rotation. 
Questions: 1. Explain physiologically the variations in the ap- 
parent direction of rotation with eyes closed. 
2. Give an explanation of the apparent movements of the sur- 
roundings with eyes open. 
3. What do you judge from your experiment to be the cause of 
dizziness? 
4. You have doubtless had the experience when objects were 
moving past you that you were yourself moving, although your 
body was stationary. Describe two such instances and explain 
them from what you have learned in this experiment. 
5. Name the factors by which you perceive motion of the body 
in a straight line with eyes closed.

X. KINASTHETIC SENSE 
1. Sensations of Active and Passive Movement (31) 
Materials: A piece of white cardboard about two feet square. 
Method: On the sheet of cardboard the experimenter draws a 
quadrant whose radius is the distance from the subject’s elbow to 
the tip of his middle finger. He then 
lays off the degrees of the arc in steps 
of ten, as shown in figure 6. 
A. Passive Movement. The sub- 
ject places his arm on the arc with 
his elbow at the center and his middle 
finger at zero°. He then lookscare- 1; 
fully at the arc to fix in mind the 9 
positions of the different degrees. {posmon 
After this is accomplished he closes Or SPRUE CDS 
his eyes and relaxes the muscles of ee 
thearm. Using the elbow as a pivot the experimenter moves the 
subject’s arm by the wrist through a certain arc of the quadrant, 
stopping with the middle finger pointing to one of the degree 
marks. The subject with his eyes still closed judges the distance 
moved in degrees. The experimenter makes a note of the actual 
and the estimated amount of the movement. 
This is done ten times over varying distances, the subject being 
kept in ignorance of his errors. The subject is to note the quality of 
the kinesthetic sensations. 
B. Active Movement. This procedure is the same, except that the 
subject moves his own arm a certain distance and before opening 
his eyes estimates the movement in degrees. He should not have in 
mind beforehand a definite degree at which he is to stop. Again he 
notes the quality of the movement sensations. The experimenter 
notes down the actual and estimated movement as before. The ARC FOR ©

XI. THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL LAW (WEBER’S LAW) 
1. The Method in Vision (32) 
Materials: Color-wheel.! Black and white discs of two sizes. 
Measuring disc. 
Method: The experimenter places a large black and a large white 
disc interlapped upon the color-wheel, and upon these a small black 
and a small white disc interlapped. He adjusts both pairs of discs so 
that 90° of black and 270° of white are exposed. The wheel is re- 
volved to make sure that the two grays (inner and outer) are of the 
same brightness. 
The experimenter now adds a small amount of white to the outer 
discs and revolves the wheel. [The inner disc remains unchanged 
as a standard throughout the experiment.] The subject reports 
whether he sees a difference in brightness between the outer and 
the inner discs. If necessary, continue to add white to the outer 
disc until a difference is observed upon rotation. Measure the 
amount of white which has been added. 
Starting with the outer disc plainly brighter than the inner, de- 
crease the amount of white until subjective equality is obtained. 
Note in degrees the difference of the white in the inner and outer 
discs. 
Now starting as at first with the outer and inner discs equal, 
decrease the amount of white in the outer until a difference is just 
perceptible. Note the number of degrees difference as before. 
Finally starting with the outer disc plainly darker than the inner, 
increase the white until subjective equality is reached. Take the 
measurement as before. 
Follow out this entire procedure three times, obtaining in all 
twelve measurements. 
1 The Milton-Bradley color tops and discs may be used.

  48 THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL LAW 
The experiment is now repeated, using as a standard (in the inner 
disc) 180° of white and 180° of black.

  THE METHOD IN TOUCH 49 
2. The Method in Touch (33) 
Materials: Balance or letter scale. One hundred no. 3 black 
burrs (or washers) as shown in figure 7, having the diameter of the 
hole one quarter inch and the outer diameter five 
eighths inch. Two holders made from wooden 
skewers or round sticks, less in diameter than the 
hole of the burr and about 5 inches in length, to 
each of which is tacked a disc of stiff cardboard 13 
inches in diameter, as shown in figure 8. Weigh 
the holders on the scale or balance and, if they are not exactly 
equal, whittle one of 
the handles down un- 
til they are of equal 
weight. 
Method: ‘Find the 
approximate weight of 
a holder in terms of 
number of burrs. The 
experimenter slips five 
burrs on each holder 
and proceeds to find 
the number of burrs 
which he must add to 
one of the holders in 
order that the subject 
may feel a difference be- 
tween the two weights. 
That is, he is to find the threshold of difference for pressure hav- 
ing as a standard the weight of five burrs plus the weight of the 
holder in terms of burrs. If the holder is equal in weight to 
three burrs, the standard is in this instance eight burrs. 
This standard weight is kept constant throughout the experi- 
ment. The other is called the comparison weight. The subject, 
with eyes closed, now rests his open hand comfortably on the table, Fic. 7.

palm upward. If desired, he may support it on several books. 
The experimenter places one burr more on the comparison holder 
and then rests the holders alternately on the open palm. The 
holder should be allowed to rest on the hand for two seconds and 
removed, and then an interval of two seconds allowed before the 
other holder is applied. Rest the holder always on the same part 
of the palm, and avoid dropping or pressing it against the hand. 
The subject says whether the second weight feels lighter or heavier 
than the first. 
After about five seconds a second trial is made and the subject 
reports as before. Continue this procedure for ten trials, placing 
sometimes the heavier, and sometimes the lighter holder on the 
hand first, in no definite order. If seven out of ten of the subject’s 
judgments are correct, you may infer that the threshold of differ- 
ence has been reached. [Seven out of ten is considered a sufficient 
proportion to eliminate the possibility of chance.] If more than 
three errors are made, add another burr to the comparison holder 
and proceed as before. If necessary add still another burr and 
repeat the ten trials a second time, and so on until the subject is 
able correctly to detect the difference in seven trials out of ten. 
The experimenter then notes the threshold of difference in terms 
of burrs. 
The experimenter now makes the comparison holder three burrs 
heavier than this threshold and applies the holders to the hand as 
before, the subject judging each time whether the second weight 
is heavier or lighter. If more than seventy per cent of his answers 
are correct, the experimenter removes one burr and repeats. Con- 
tinue this procedure until the weight is reached at which three or 
more incorrect judgments are made in the ten trials. The thresh- 
old of difference as obtained by this method is noted. 
The entire experiment is now repeated with the constant holder 
containing twenty-five instead of five burrs. The standard will 
in this case be considered as twenty-five plus that number of burrs 
which are equal in weight to the holder. 
At no time during the experiment should the subject be allowed

set fatigue. The subject may open his eyes occasionally between 
trials. 
Record: (1) State the average of the two thresholds at the lower 
standard, obtained by “coming in” toward the standard and by 
“going out” away from the standard respectively. Give the aver- 
age also of the thresholds at the higher standard. 
(2) Present the ratios of these final thresholds of difference to 
their respective standard weights. 
Questions: 1. Do your results conform to Weber’s law? If not, 
give reasons why. 
2. In what two ways does the method used in this experiment 
differ from that of the preceding? Which of the two experiments 
do you consider more accurate? Why? 
3. Why was it necessary to allow an interval between the appli- 
cations of the standard and the comparison weight? 
4. What was the purpose of presenting the standard and com- 
parison weights in “no regular order ” in the successive trials? 
This involves the so-called “‘ time error.” What would be meant

XII. PERCEPTION OF SPACE 
A. LocatizaTION 
1. Localization of Sound (one sound) (34) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: A sound cage. A telephone receiver in series with a 
battery and telegraph key.! The sound cage should be constructed 
as in figure 9. The horizontal rim of the cage is divided on the 
inside into steps of twenty de- 
grees beginning with zero° and 
proceeding to 180° on both right 
and left sides. 
Method: The horizontal rim 
is adjusted to the level of the 
ears of the subject, who sits 
with his eyes closed and his ears 
directly in the center of the rim. 
He faces the zero mark. The 
experimenter holds the tele- 
phone receiver at the various 
degrees of the rim, on both right and left sides, in no regular 
order. An assistant presses the key for each location, and the 
subject each time judges the location of the click by pointing. 
The actual and estimated locations are recorded for each trial. 
The receiver should be moved slowly and noiselessly from one 
location to another. The ,subject introspects on his method of 
localizing the sound. 
  Fic. 9. 
1 Tf the sound cage and telephone receiver are not available, the main facts of this 
experiment can be brought out by the use of a tuning fork, snapper, or other source 
of sound. The sound is made at various places around the subject’s head, and the 
direction, both actual and judged, roughly estimated and tabulated.

*2. Localization of Sound (two sounds) (35) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Sound cage. Two telephone receivers wired in par- 
allel, with a rheostat in series with one receiver. Two receivers 
should be selected which give the same quality of sound. 
Method: The subject is seated with closed eyes as before. The 
receivers are sounded successively, varying the resistance until the 
subject reports that the two clicks seem of equal intensity. The 
assistant now holds one receiver at 45° on the left side of the sub- 
ject, while the experimenter places the other at the various de- 
grees of the right side and sounds the key. The subject states 
whether he hears one sound or two. If one, he localizes it by point- 
ing. The experimenter now holds his receiver at 45° while the 
assistant places his at the various degrees of the left side. Use 
either the “ make ” or the “ break ” for the sound stimulus. The 
subject should not be given any clue as to the movement of the 
receivers. { 
When two sounds are heard the subject should introspect upon 
the nature of the resulting spacial perception. 
Repeat the experiment, using as many subjects as time allows.

3. Localization of Touch (36) 
Materials: Two wooden skewers. Metric rule. Soft pencil. 
Method: The subject closes his eyes and extends his left forearm 
palm upward. The experimenter draws with a fairly sharp-pointed 
soft pencil a longitudinal and a transverse line (ruled), intersect- 
ing at right angles, on the under side of the subject’s forearm. The 
lines should be about six centimeters in length and should bisect 
each other. The transverse axis is to be called «, and the longi- 
tudinal y. 
The experimenter now makes a copy of the two axes on cross 
section paper indicating the four directions: proximal, distal, 
radial, and ulnar. The subject, with his eyes closed, holds the 
skewer, near its point, in his right hand which should rest upon 
his knee. The experimenter with the other skewer touches the 
point of intersection of the two axes. Immediately after the ex- 
perimenter’s skewer is removed the subject tries to touch the point 
stimulated with his skewer, holding the skewer down at the first 
point he touches. i 
The experimenter measures in millimeters (disregarding frac- 
tions) the perpendicular distances from « and from y of the sub- 
ject’s localization, and with these measurements locates accurately 
in the notebook map the point touched by the subject. Measure- 
ments to the right of y are + ; those to the left are —; above x, +; 
below x, —. The measurements should also be set down numeri- 
cally in a table as shown below. 
Twenty localizations are to be made and recorded in this man- 
ner. In each trial the subject should begin with his right hand 
resting on his knee. He should observe the various factors by the 
aid of which he makes his localization. The number of the trial 
should be placed above the dot in the notebook map. The sub- 
ject may be allowed to rest and to open his eyes from time to time 
during the experiment, provided he is careful to turn his wrist over 
so as not to see the lines.

B. Two DIMENSIONAL SPACE 
1. Kinesthetic Perception of Horizontal Linear Space (37) 
Materials: A yardstick. 
Method: A. Reproduction after Visual Perception. 
Place the yardstick on the table horizontally before the subject 
with the inches reading from left to right. The subject, sitting 
equidistant between the two ends, selects and names a certain inch 
mark, e.g. 25, and notes carefully its location on the stick. He then 
closes his eyes and starting at the left end of the stick runs his right 
forefinger along the edge until he thinks he has just reached the 
mark chosen. The experimenter notes down the mark selected and 
the amount of error, indicating its direction from the mark by + 
if it is overestimated and by —if underestimated. Before open- 
ing his eyes the subject should remove his finger. He should re- 
main in ignorance of both the amount and the direction of his 
error until the experiment is completed. 
This procedure is repeated ten times, the subject selecting the 
inch marks in no definite order. Three precautions are necessary: 
(x) The subject must keep his head directed squarely in front 
while running his finger along the edge. (2) He must maintain 
a constant speed. (3) The first point at which he stops is to be 
taken as the result of the trial. No corrections are to be allowed. 
B. Reproduction after Visual and Kinesthetic Perception. 
Method A is followed except that the subject, instead of merely 
looking at the inch marks, draws his finger slowly along the edge 
with his eyes open until a desired mark is reached. He then repro- 
duces the movement with eyes closed as before. The same precau- 
tions are to be observed.

2. Discuss the relation of length of distance chosen to the accu- 
racy of reproduction. 
3. Do your results indicate any effect of practice? How might

of practice in reproducing one distance can be transferred to the 
reproduction of distances in general?

2. Kinesthetic Perception of Vertical Linear Space? (38) 
Materials: A yardstick. 
Method: The procedures A and B are used as in the preceding 
experiment, except that the yardstick is now held by the experi- 
menter in an upright position before the subject, with the one 
inch mark at the bottom. The subject reproduces the distances by 
beginning at the bottom and moving his finger upward along the 
edge of the stick. 
Record: The results are tabulated as in the preceding experi- 
ment. 
Questions: 1. Is the reproduction of vertical space more or less 
accurate than that of horizontal? Give an explanation. 
2. How do horizontal and vertical reproductions compare in 
regard to tendencies for (a) overestimating the movement, (d) 
underestimating the movement? Answer this question from a 
survey of both the number of plus and minus errors, and their re- 
spective percentile averages. 
3. Give an explanation for these tendencies. 
*4. Describe a simple modification of this experiment to show 
whether the error of reproduction is of visual or of kinesthetic 
origin.

  KINESTHETIC PERCEPTION OF SIZE 61 
3. Kinzesthetic Perception of Size (39) 
Materials: A wooden stick between 12 and 24 inches in length. 
Method: The stick should not be seen by the subject until the 
experiment is finished. With eyes closed the subject holds the stick 
endwise between the palms of his hands, noting kinesthetically 
the distance by which the hands are separated. The experimenter 
removes the stick, and the subject then places his hands in his lap 
for five seconds. With eyes closed he now reproduces the distance, 
holding his hands as nearly as possible at the same distance apart 
as when holding the stick. The experimenter measures the error. 
Ten trials are made, the stick being presented before each trial. 
The subject must be kept in ignorance throughout of the amount 
and direction of his errors. He should introspect upon the method 
of reproduction. 
Record: Tabulate the amounts and the directions of the errors, 
and find the averages of the plus and the minus errors separately. 
Questions: 1. State and give reasons for any tendency shown in 
the direction of the errors. 
2. State and explain the effect of practice in the successive es- 
timations. 
3. Give an introspective account of the criteria involved in the 
estimation.

4. Tactual, Kinzsthetic, and Visual Perception of Form (40) 
Materials: Three figures about three-fourths inch in diameter, 
cut from sheet metal or stiff bristol board. They should be of 
graded complexity, such as a round disc, a diamond, and a star. 
Method: The exact shapes chosen must be concealed from the 
subject until parts A and B of the method are completed. 
A. The subject closes his eyes and extends his left hand palm 
up. The experimenter places the simplest figure in the middle of 
the palm and presses it gently so that its edges touch at all points. 
The figure is then removed and the subject opens his eyes and 
draws the form as he perceived it. 
B. The experimenter now replaces the figure and holds it in 
place with a pencil. The subject with eyes closed runs his fore- 
finger around the edge. The figure is then removed and the subject 
draws its apparent shape as before. 
C. The subject now looks at the figure and draws it as accu- 
rately as possible. 
These three procedures are followed with the other forms. 
Record: Present the drawings of the different forms under the 
various conditions. 
Questions: 1. What differences do you find in the drawings 
under A, B, and C? Discuss the causes of these differences. 
2. Describe all that introspection affords in perceiving the form 
by running the finger about the edge of the figure. 
3. What evidence have we that practice can improve the tac- 
tual and kinesthetic perception of form?

TACTUAL PERCEPTION OF DISTANCE 63 
5. Tactual Perception of Distance (41) 
Materials: An ethesiometer, or a pair of dividers to which 
should be attached bluntly pointed wooden tips. A metric rule. 
Method: An ink dot is placed on the under side of the subject’s 
forearm about three inches above the wrist. Starting with the 
points of the dividers set one half a centimeter apart, the experi- 
menter stimulates the subject’s forearm. The two points are ap- 
plied with equal and constant pressure, lengthwise of the arm, one 
on either side of the ink dot. The subject, with his eyes closed, 
states whether he feels one or two points. This is repeated five 
times. Occasionally only one point is applied in order to test the 
carefulness of the judgment. 
The experimenter proceeds as before, increasing the distance 
between the points, as required, by small amounts until three or 
more of the five stimulations yield discrimination of two points. 
This distance is noted. 
Starting with the points somewhat further apart than this 
threshold, the experimenter gradually decreases the distance until 
three out of five trials give one point judgments. Note the distance” 
as before. 
Make another trial, repeating both “in” and “out” proced- 
ures. 
One often ‘“‘knows” that there are two points because he feels 
a blunt or extended sensation. The subject must not base judg- 
ments of two points on this criterion, but must actually perceive 
the “ twoness ” of the points. 
The entire experiment is now repeated with the points placed 
crosswise of the arm on either side of the ink dot.

tactual space sensations, made as shown in 
figures 11 and 12. In card (a) the distance 
between the points of the two end teeth is 
2 inches. Card (6) which consists of a 
movable strip with a tooth (z) inserted 
under the two loops of another toothed 
card (2), should be so constructed that the 
two teeth can be placed as near together 
as one inch and as far apart as 2% inches. 
The two figures given may be used as pat- 
terns. Metric rule. 
Method: The subject closes his eyes and 
extends his forearm palm up. Card (0) 
should be set so that the distance between 
the movable and fixed points is the same as 
that between the two end points of card (a). 
The experimenter now takes card (a) and 
presses the teeth longitudinally against the 
forearm about two inches above the wrist. 
All the teeth should touch the skin. Im- 
mediately thereafter he stimulates the wrist (b) 
with card (6) about one centimeter to one Fic. 12.

side of the first stimulation. Be sure that the two points touch 
the arm with the same pressure. The subject judges whether 
the distance between the two points seems equal to, or greater or 
less than, the entire length of the row of teeth in card (a). If they 
do not seem equal, the distance between the points of card (6) 
is altered until upon successive applications to the wrist the sub- 
ject reports equality in the seeming length of the two stimuli. 
The unfilled distance is then measured and noted, the subject 
being kept in ignorance of the nature of his error. 
Six such trials are made, the experimenter using sometimes the 
‘ out,’ and sometimes the ‘ in,’ direction of procedure as followed 
in former experiments.

  STEREOSCOPIC VISION 71 
C. THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE 
1. Stereoscopic Vision (44) 
(Individual experiment) 
Materials: A hand stereoscope; or two cardboard mailing tubes 
of the same size (approximately 1 inch in diameter and 12 inches 
long), white translucent paper, and mucilage. Ruler. 
Method: A. Analysis. 
An object which has three dimensions will cast upon the two 
retinas slightly dissimilar images. This is because the eyes see the 
object at slightly different angles. It is the fusion of these two 
images in the higher nerve centers that gives us our perception of 
the solid character of the object. 
To begin with the simplest condition of three dimensional space, 
we may take two points, a and 6, whose position in space is such 
that b is to the right of and behind a. A diagram, as in figure 15, 
shows how these points strike the 
two retinas. The rays may be 
represented as crossing at 0. The 
eyes are focused on point a, so 
that a’s image falls on the fovee of 
the right and left eyes at a? and a! 
respectively. It will be seen that 5 
falls nearer to a in the left than in 
the right eye, and that the two 
images, b'a1 and 67a?, are conse- 
quently dissimilar. It is this dis- 
similarity as mentioned above 
which gives us the perception of 5 
as back of a. 
Ina similar manner we can draw the diagram of three or more 
points placed in any relative position, keeping in mind that each 
eye receives its own image of the entire group of points. We can 
- also reverse the procedure and from the two retinal images, 61a1 
and b7a?, locate the two points, a and 6, in space. 
  Fic. 15.

  72 PERCEPTION OF SPACE 
Work out the following exercises, keeping a as the focal point. 
Problem 1. Draw a diagram, similar to figure 15, but so that 
6 is to the left of and in front of a in space. 
Problem 2. With the retinal distance between b! and a! greater 
than that between 6? and a, draw a diagram showing the loca- 
tion of points a and 6 in space. 
Problem 3. With the retinal distance 61a! equal to 6a*, draw 
a diagram locating a and 6 as before. 
Problem 4. Draw a diagram showing a bar in the horizontal 
plane before the eyes, with the left end further away than the 
right, and with the focus upon the nearer end. 
B. Synthesis. 
Instead of having the two eyes converge upon a single solid ob- 
ject in space, stereoscopic vision may be obtained by taking the 
two images as given to the right and left eyes respectively, and 
after separating artificially the field of vision of the right eye from 
that of the left, placing them before the right and left eyes. Each 
eye thus sees only its own image 
of the object. It is possible to de- 
termine these two pictures, called 
astereogram, by means of diagrams 
similar to those you have drawn. 
Suppose three points a, b, and c, 
are given, with 6 between and 
nearer to the eyes than a and c. 
The diagram of these three points 
is shown in figure 16. The stereo- 
gram necessary to produce a, b, 
and c, stereoscopically, when its 
two pictures are held before their 
fh La corresponding eyes, is shown in 
Fic, 16. figure 17. It will be seen that the 
three points have the same spacial 
relation in the right and left pictures of the stereogram as on 
the right and left retinas respectively of the diagram, except a c 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  STEREOSCOPIC VISION 73 
that, since the rays cross in the eye, the order of points a, 6, and 
c is in the stereogram the reverse of their order on the retinas. 
  Fic. 17.} 
Draw diagrams and stereograms according to the following 
problems. These stereograms are to be verified in the stereoscope. 
[If stereoscopes are not available, draw the two figures of each 
stereogram in ink on translucent paper and fasten them with 
mucilage across the ends of the two mailing tubes. Now look 
through the tubes toward the light, being careful to hold the right 
eye’s picture before the right eye and the left before the left eye. 
Alter the distance between the outer ends of the tubes until 
the figures fuse.] In the conditions of the following problems let 
the eyes fixate the nearest point of the figures. 
Problem 5. A triangular prism standing upright with one edge 
squarely in front of the two eyes. 
Problem 6. A quadrilateral pyramid with the apex pointing

  XIII. PERCEPTION OF TIME 
1. Estimation of Time Intervals (48 
Materials: Watch with second hand. 
Method: The experimenter taps with a pencil to mark the be- 
ginning and end of an interval of approximately a half minute. 
The exact length of the interval should not be known by the sub- 
ject. The subject sits passively attending to this interval. Imme- 
diately afterward the subject reproduces the interval as accu- 
rately as possible by a tap at the beginning and end of the interval. 
The error of the reproduced interval (plus or minus) is noted down 
by the experimenter. This is repeated ten times. The subject 
should use no deliberate criteria such as counting, but should per- 
ceive the time interval directly. 
Repeat the entire procedure, using an interval of twice the length 
of the first. The subject should remain in ignorance of the nature 
of his error throughout the experiment. 
Record: Give the two lists of time estimations with the average 
error (regardless of signs) and the constant error (regarding signs) 
for each list. 
Questions: 1. Judging from your results what law can you for- 
mulate to express the relation of length of interval to accuracy of 
time perception? Consult also the results of the other members 
of the class. 
2. What effects of practice are seen in your results? 
3. Give an account of the subject’s introspection of his method 
of estimating time intervals. 
4. Give an explanation of any tendency you may find in the 
direction of the errors.

  76 PERCEPTION OF TIME 
2. Perception of Filled and Unfilled Time (46) 
Materials: Watch with second hand. Metronome. 
Method: The metronome is started at its slowest rate, and the 
subjects of the class listen passively for a few minutes until they 
become adjusted to the rhythm of the beats. The instructor 
then measures a time interval of between 60 and go seconds by 
tapping at its beginning and end. The subject (in each pair of 
students) listens passively during this interval to the ticking of the 
metronome. He should not, however, see the instrument nor count 
its beats. The experimenter (in each pair) carefully times the 
interval given by the instructor. As soon as the second tap is 
given the metronome is silenced, and the subject reproduces the 
interval as accurately as possible, not by tapping, but by a move- 
ment of the index finger at the beginning and end of his estimated 
interval. The error of reproduction (plus or minus) is noted by 
the experimenter. Ten such trials are made. 
The entire procedure is repeated four times, using four other 
speeds of the metronome, including its highest speed, but keeping 
the same standard time interval. 
= Record: Tabulate the five lists (of ten reproduction errors each) 
for the five speeds of the metronome. Give the average and the 
constant error for each list. 
Questions: 1. Judging from your results what can you say con- 
cerning the difference in constant error and in accuracy between 
filled and unfilled time perceptions? 
{: 2. How would you explain these differences? 
3. What effect has the variation of the speed of the metronome 
on the estimation of the filled time interval? How do you account 
for this effect? 
4. State several situations from everyday life in which the per- 
ception of filled and unfilled time conforms to the results of your 
experiment.

  PERCEPTION OF FILLED AND UNFILLED TIME 77 
3. Perception of Filled and Unfilled Time (Alternative Method) (47) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Watch with second hand. An interesting short story. 
Method: The experimenter measures by tapping an empty time 
interval of over five minutes. The subjects sit passively with their 
minds as little occupied as possible, and at the end of the interval 
estimate its length and note it down. Immediately thereafter the 
experimenter reads the story for an interval of between three and 
eight minutes. The subjects give full attention to the story, and 
at the end of the reading write down their estimations of the 
length of this interval. The experimenter keeps a record of the 
two original intervals. 
The class makes three such estimations, the original filled and 
unfilled intervals being varied in the successive trials. 
Record: The duration of the three original pairs of intervals is 
now given, and each subject computes the per cent (plus or minus) 
of his error for each pair of filled and unfilled intervals. 
Tabulate the three percentile errors for the filled, and the three 
for the unfilled, intervals. Compute the constant error for each 
form of interval. 
Questions: Answer questions 1, 2, and 4 under the preceding 
experiment.

4. Perception of Subjective Temporal Rhythm (48) 
(Individual experiment) 
Materials: Metronome. Piece of felt. 
Method: The metronome is placed in the middle of the back part 
of the room. It should rest on a piece of felt. The instructor starts 
the metronome at its slowest speed. The subjects listen passively 
to the ticking for a minute. They should not look at the metro- 
nome nor count the beats. Introspection should be made and 
note taken of the manner of perceiving the beats, especially in re- 
gard to grouping and accentuation. 
Repeat the procedure using four other rates of the metronome, 
including the highest speed, with two minute intervals of rest be- 
tween the successive rates. 
Record: Make a graphic representation of the perception of 
rhythm for each of the five rates, showing how the sounds were 
grouped, etc. 
Questions: 1. What relation exists between the rate of the metro- 
nome and the rhythm perceived? i 
2. From a survey of the results of other subjects state whether 
there are any general tendencies in the perception of the rhythms 
of different speeds. 
3. Describe from your introspection the sensory processes in- 
volved in the perception of rhythm. 
4. Give an instance of the perception of subjective rhythm from 
everyday experience.

Materials: Tachistoscope.! If regular tachistoscopes cannot be 
obtained, they may be constructed from cardboard according to 
the following directions: 
In the construction of the tachistoscope three main parts are 
involved: a back piece, shown in figure 18; a front piece, shown 
in figure 19; and a middle piece, or shutter, the back and front views 
of which are shown in figures 20 and 21. These parts are to be 
cut with a sharp knife from stiff cardboard (about 8 ply) with a 
glazed white surface. 
It is necessary that 
the parts have the 
same proportions as 
shown in the draw- 
ings; and they should 
be made at least dou- 
ble the size shown. 
The figures may be 
used as patterns, the 
measurements as 
taken from them being 
always doubled.

figures 20 and 21. The window (c) is the same size as in the 
front and back pieces; 
and when the shutter is

shutter, shown in figure 21, 
is glued a small piece of 
cardboard as shown at h. 
The parts are now to be 
fitted together. The shut- 
ter is pivoted onto the back 
piece at ¢, as shown in fig- 
ure 22, by a small carpet 
tack which, on the under SHUTTER (REVERSE SIDE) 
side of the back piece, is Wee 
passed through a card- 
board washer and riveted. It should not be fastened too tightly, 
for the shutter must swing with the least friction possible. 
Through one of the 
small holes (g) a rub- 
ber band is passed and 
looped through itself 
as shown, with its 
‘other end secured by 
the notches in the lower 
left-hand corner of the 
back piece. A thin and 
rather yielding rubber 
band should beselected, 
but one which is free 
from flaws. Parts a 
now serve as stops for 
the shutter, and also 
give it room to swing 
freely when the front 
piece is placed on top. 
Now place the front 
piece in position over 
the back piece and shutter as they are shown in figure 22. The 
left-hand edge of the front piece should coincide with the left-

hand edge of the back piece; and the ‘ trigger’ (7) should project 
a little to the right of the front piece, as shown in figure 23. The 
front and back pieces are fastened together by four small brass 
paper fasteners placed as in figure 23. They are thrust through 
small slits (not holes) 
cut through the layers 
of cardboard with the 
point of a knife. The 
essential requirement 
i in fitting the front piece 
is that the position of 
its window should coin- 
cide with that of the 
window of the back 
piece. 
From the back the 
tachistoscope appears 
as shown in figure 24 
A and B. Over the 
window of the back 
piece is glued a rec- 
tangular piece of card- 
FRONT (FINISHED) board (7), as shown in 
Fic. 23. A. The glue is applied 
not in the middle part 
of j, but only at the ends, outside the dotted lines (k). This 
forms a holder through which a slip of paper may be passed and 
moved up or down across the window of the back piece. Atl a 
small aperture is cut which should be at the center of the win- 
dow of the back piece. 
In figure 24 A the shutter is ‘down.’ Its outline is shown by a 
dotted line. A small hole about the size of a match stick should 
now be put through the shutter and front piece as shown at f: and 
jz. They should be so placed that when the window of the shutter 
is open (ie, when the shutter is rotated until its window coin-

cides with the windows of the front and back pieces), the two holes 
also will coincide. 
Figure 24.B shows the shutter ‘up,’ that is, with the small 
piece (2) caught on the trigger (i). 
The principle of this tachistoscope is as follows: when the shut- 
ter is up, and the tachistoscope ‘set,’ as in figure 24 B, the lower 
part of the cardboard shutter obstructs the window (c) as seen 
from the front, as in figure 23. The exposure material inserted in 
the holder (figure 24 A /) is therefore concealed. When the trigger 
(i) is bent backward slightly the shutter is released and is pulled 
quickly by the tension of the rubber band across the coinciding 
windows of the back and front pieces. As its window crosses this 
window the stimulus is exposed for a brief interval. For work in 
perception this interval should be a little less than one tenth of a 
second. If the move- 
ment of the shutter is 
too rapid or too slow 
to permit a single act 
of perception, the rub- 
ber band may be either 
changed or placed in 
one of the other holes 
provided near the lower 
edge of the shutter. 
The shutter window 
passes across the open- 
ing of back and front 
pieces closing it again, 
and is stopped by the 
piece as, shown in fig- 
ure 18. 
The exposure mate- 
rial is printed or written in rows on a strip of paper, and in- 
serted in the holder, as shown in figure 25. On the reverse side 
of the paper, directly behind each row of stimuli, is placed a

conspicuous mark which appears at the small aperture (/) as the 
slip is pulled through, thus informing the experimenter when the 
stimulus is in its proper position at the window. 
Certain experiments in perception may require a pointer for 
use in the window. This can be cut from fairly stiff paper, as 
shown in figure 26. The tip is blackened in order to be conspicu- 
  Fic. 26. 
ous. The pointer is inserted between the back and front pieces, 
and can be directed to any part of the window desired. 
Work in memory requires an open shutter. This can be pro- 
vided by placing the two holes (f:), and (f2) in figure 24 A, so that 
they coincide, and locking them in this position by a piece of 
match stick. : 
A few directions are helpful for the operation of the tachistoscope.

of his left forefinger 
(having the hand palm

of the shutter (at g in 
figure 24.4), and pushes 
the shutter upward, 
slipping it under the 
trigger (i). When its 
cardboard catch comes 
above the trigger it will 
spring back, locking the 
shutter as infigure 24 B. 
The stimulus is then ar- 
ranged as desired, and 
the tachistoscope held 
fairly close to the sub- 
ject and in good light. 
To release the shutter 
the experimenter, still 
holding the instrument 
in his right hand near 
the bottom, pulls back 
slightly the trigger (7)

the case of the crosses. Care must be taken that the subject does 
not see any of the lists until they are presented in the tachistoscope. 
Starting with the top line, which is the smallest series, the ex- 
perimenter gives a preparatory signal, and after two seconds re- 
leases the shutter, exposing the stimulus for less than one tenth 
of a second. The subject states as accurately and fully as pos- 
sible what he has perceived. If this is correct the experimenter 
continues as before, using the successive lines in turn until the 
subject is unable correctly to repeat the stimulus. Since the first 
mistake may be accidental, try one or two longer series before 
finally noting the span of perception for this type of stimulus. 
This procedure is carried out for each of the six classes of ex- 
posure material. 
Record: Tabulate the largest group of units which can be com- 
bined into a single act of perception for each of the six types of 
stimuli.

  XV. PERCEPTION OF WORDS AND MEANING 
1. Synthesis of Successive Perceptions (50) 
Materials: Tachistoscope as in preceding experiment. Expo- 
sure material as described under method. 
Method: Five unfamiliar words, considerably longer than the 
span of perception for unfamiliar words, as determined in the 
preceding experiment, are prepared for exposure in the tachisto- 
scope. An example of such a word is ‘cytoreticulum.’ Inasmuch 
as the subject must not see the word before its exposure, the ex- 
perimenter must use his judgment as to whether the word is un- 
familiar to the subject. 
The experimenter presents the first word in the tachistoscope, 
giving a brief exposure, as in the preceding experiment. The sub- 
ject notes down the letters he was able to perceive. The exposures 
are repeated until the subject can grasp all the letters of the word 
at one time, noting for each exposure the group of letters seen. 
Repeat this procedure, using the other four words. 
Record: Tabulate the successive perceptions of the five words 
in the form suggested below. The successive perceptions of ‘ cy-

Questions: 1. From an examination of your results and from the 
subject’s introspection what general tendencies, if any, would 
you say the subject shows in synthesizing the successive percep- 
tions of words?

Materials: Tachistoscope with a movable pointer to direct 
attention to definite parts of the exposure window. Five long un- 
familiar words selected and prepared as in the preceding experi- 
ment. 
Method: The experimenter exposes the words in the tachisto- 
scope as in the preceding experiment, repeating until the subject 
can grasp the entire word. In doing this, however, the following 
variation from the former experiment is used: For the first ex- 
posure the pointer is placed at the middle of the first syllable 
of the word, for the second exposure it is placed at the middle 
of the word, and for the third toward the end of the word. The 
subject notes down his successive perceptions as before. Repeat 
this procedure, if necessary, until the entire word is seen as a 
whole. Vary the position of the pointer as the case requires. 
Record: Tabulate the successive perceptions of the five different 
words with the various positions of the pointer, as indicated in 
the table.

six three-letter words. One of these lists is composed entirely of 
words with line letters, the other of words whose first and last 
letters extend above or below the line. These lists are written 
instead of printed. Each of the two lists is written in a line, with 
the words sufficiently small and close together so that all six can 
be exposed in the window of the tachistoscope at the same time.

Method: The experimenter prepares three lists of skeleton words, 
formed from familiar five-letter words, using the following scheme 
of omissions as a model in each list. (Fig. 
30.) The lists are written on slips for use 
pe fee ca in the tachistoscope. 
The corresponding words of figure 30

Tee vy house. The experimenter exposes the 
Ga words, one at a time in the tachistoscope 
“~~ with the shutter left open. The subject 
forms a word as quickly as possible, sub- 
stituting letters for the blanks. The ex- 
b i : perimenter notes the time required for 
a gi each word. Any sense word the subject 
may give, which properly fills the blanks, 
is acceptable. All eighteen words are exposed in this way. 
The subject should introspect on his method of perception. 
Record: Tabulate as shown below the skeleton words, the words 
formed by the subject, the time required for each word, and the 
average time for the six types of omission. gory eer Seer, ee

Method: The experimenter prints for exposure in the tachisto- 
scope three lists of seven words each whose letters are transposed. 
The words in the first list should be unrelated. In the second 
list they should all belong to the same category; for example, the 
category in the list given below is that of articles to be found in 
a schoolroom. The third list should be composed of words all re- 
lated to one of the leading interests of the subject, such as foot- 
ball, tennis, music, etc. The subject must not know the category 
of either the second or third list. 
The letters of the words should be so transposed that the initial 
letter of the original word does not come first, nor should any two

  DETERMINING TENDENCY 97 
The lists are exposed, one word at a time, with the shutter open. 
The subject speaks the word, whose transposed letters are given, 
as soon as he ‘sees’ it. The time required for the correct per- 
ception of each word is noted by the experimenter. A short rest 
should be given between the lists. The subject introspects on his 
manner of finding the words. 
Record: Tabulate for each list the transposed words, the orig- 
inal words, and the times required by the subject for perceiving 
the words. Present the average time for each of the three lists. 
Questions: 1. Give reasons for any differences you find in the 
average times of the three lists. 
2. Why is this experiment called ‘determining tendency’? 
3. Give reasons for any extreme variations from the average. 
4. Judging from the subject’s introspection, do you think the 
category played a conscious or an unconscious part in perceiving 
the word? 
5. If used as a mental test, what ability or abilities do you 
think this experiment could measure?

  98 _ PERCEPTION OF WORDS AND MEANING 
6. Errors of Perception (Neglect of Misspelling) (55) 
Materials: Tachistoscope. Exposure material as described under 
method. 
Method: The experimenter prints a list of twelve words slightly 
shorter than the threshold span, six of which are slightly mis- 
spelled: — for example, STRENGH, BELEIVE, BYCICLE, etc. The 
misspelling should consist merely of the change of one or two 
letters; the general form of the word should not be altered. 
These words are presented by the experimenter in the tachisto- 
scope. They are given one at a time and for the usual quick ex- 
posure interval. After each word the subject writes down what he 
has seen. He must, of course, not know beforehand which words 
are misspelled. 
Record: Present the two lists (the original and the one produced 
by the subject) side by side. Underline all cases of oversight of 
misspelling and any other perceptual errors which may appear. 
Questions: 1. Why do we overlook the misspelling of common 
words? 
2. Show how this type of erroneous perception must be taken 
into account in different occupations. 
, 3- How can it be overcome? 
*4, Judging from your own experience, what effect do emotional 
states have on the accuracy of perception? Give examples.

Method: Beginning at the beginning of Test I, the subject un- 
derlines as rapidly as possible all groups of consecutive letters 
which make words, for example ‘eye’ and ‘cat’ in the first 
line. One-letter words, such as ‘a,’ are not to be underlined. 
Sometimes more than one word can be formed from a group of 
letters as s-t-o-n-e, which gives stone, tone, one, to, etc. The experi- 
menter takes the time required to underline all the words in the 
series. He should not, however, see the words himself. 
In Test II the successive pairs of figures which when added make 
nine are underlined; for example, 8 1 and 4 5 near the beginning of 
the first line. Sequences like 636 are marked twice. 
The experiment is now repeated with the experimenter and sub- 
ject interchanged. 
Record: Make the following tabulations of the results: 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  STRENGTH OF ATTENTION IOI 
(1) Individual record: State your own time required for each of 
the tests, and the number of omissions which you made in each. 
A mistake in underlining should be counted as an omission; and 
such errors, if made, should not be erased nor rectified. 
(2) Group record:! For Test I, state the average time required 
and the average number of omissions for the class. 
For Test II, arrange in a table the names of the various mem- 
bers of the class in increasing order of their respective times re- 
quired for completion of the figure test. Put down the time for 
each. Find the average, and then in a column to the right, place 
the deviation of each of the individuals from this average. To do 
this simply subtract the individual time from the average, or 
the average from the individual as the case may require, omitting 
algebraic signs. Find the average of all these individual devia- 
tions. This average is called the ‘mean variation ’ (m.v.). 
Make another table arranging the members in increasing order 
of the number of omissions made in the series. Compute the aver- 
age, the individual deviations, and 
the mean variation as before. 
A third table is now made con- 
taining the names of the mem- 
bers of the class’ in increasing 
order of time required as in the 
first table, and the numbers indi- 
cating their respective positions in 
the group in regard to omissions, 
as shown in the second table. This 
table, as shown in the accompany- 
ing figure, presents a direct com- 
parison of the efficiency of the 
subjects in speed with their effi- 
ciency in quality of work. In making the table, if two subjects 
are tied for the same place, give to each a rank intermediate be- 
tween the place for which they tie and the next lower place. For. 
1 Group records can be most conveniently worked out on the blackboard. 3rd TABLE

example, if two subjects are tied for third place, give to each 3} 
and count the next place to be occupied as 5. If three are tied for 
third place, rank each as 4 and count the next place 6, —and so on. 
Questions: 1. How did your record in Test I compare with the 
class average? 
2. From the results of Test II as shown in the third table, 
discuss the relation between speed and accuracy in work which 
requires close attention. The extent to which two such charac- 
teristics occur together is known as the degree of correlation. In 
other words then, does there seem to be a certain correlation be- 
tween speed and accuracy? 
[The degree of correlation may be expressed numerically by 
using the following formula: 
62(@) 
n (n* = x)   r=1- 
Or if fractions occur the following formula may be used: 
_ 62 (2d)? 
4n(n? —1)

d=difference in rank of the subject in regard to the two traits 
correlated, That is, if subject A ranks fourth in speed and eighth 
in accuracy, d would equal 4. =(d) then is the sum of these differ- 
ences for the various subjects. 
n=number of pairs of measurements. 
It is possible for.r to range between +1 and —1. When r=o, 
the two traits have no correlation.’ When r=1, there is perfect 
correlation; that is, each subject has the same rank under both 
traits. Whenr= —1, there is perfect inverse correlation; that is, 
every subject who ranks high in one trait ranks correspondingly 
low in the other.] ]

  XVII. FLUCTUATIONS OF ATTENTION (57) 
Materials: A card six inches square on which is drawn a picture 
in reversible perspective. This picture is that of a cube, as shown 
in figure 32, which should be drawn almost the size of the card. 
a ec The letters are to be omitted in the card 
ec | 7] used. Watch with second hand. 
Method: The card is placed in a stable, 
upright position before the subject. The 
q subject fixates the line ad and tries to see 
t pt the cube with the side abcd nearer than the 
Fre. 32 side efgh. He then fixates gh and tries to 
. reverse the figure bringing efgh nearer. 
When he has gained the ability by practice to reverse the figure 
at will, he is ready to proceed with the experiment. 
A. The subject looks at the figure for one minute (time kept by 
experimenter) with passive attention, allowing his eyes to roam 
at will over the figure. He tries neither to make nor to inhibit 
reversals. He counts silently the number of reversals which do 
occur, and at the end of the minute gives the result to the experi- 
menter. Three such trials are made. 
B. Proceed as in method A except that the subject strives to 
make as many reversals as possible by looking at ab and gh alter- 
nately as in the practice period. The results for three one minute 
tests are noted as before. 
C. Proceed as before except that this time the subject fixates 
the dot o and strives to hold the figure in one position. The num- 
ber of reversals which occur in spite of his effort is noted in three 
one minute trials as before. The subject notices any eye move- 
ments which may occur, and their relation to the reversals of the 
figure. 
If time permits, repeat the experiment with subject and experi-

menter interchanged. In each of the three methods of looking at 
the figure a rest of one half minute should be given between the 
successive trials. Five minutes rest should be allowed between the 
three methods. 
Record: (1) Present a table of the number of reversals for the 
three different methods, A, B, and C, with the average for each 
method. 
(2) Give a statement, from the subject’s introspection of any 
eye movements or any unusual variations in the appearance of 
the figure which he observed in method C. 
Questions: *1. Explain the phenomenon of reversal as seen in 
method A. 
2. Judging from your introspection how would you say the 
rapid reversals of method B were obtained? 
3. What do you consider the cause or causes of the reversals in 
method C. 
4. State the extremes of ability, that is, the poorest and best 
records in the class, for the form of attention employed in method 
B, and also in method C. 
5. From a comparison of the three methods and their results, 
what can you say in regard to the fluctuations of your attention?

  MOTOR PROCESSES 
XVIII. VOLUNTARY ACTION 
1. The Simple Reaction (Motor, Sensory, and Mixed) (58) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Chronoscope. Batteries. Telegraph keys. Wiring. 
Method: The chronoscope, batteries, and one telegraph key are 
wired in series so that the release of the key breaks the circuit and 
starts the clock. Across the binding posts of this key are shunted 
in series as many keys as there are students. The closing of all 
these keys closes the circuit and stops the clock. The keys are 
so spaced in wiring that each student has one in front of him on his 
table. 
A. Sensory Reaction. The experimenter releases the single key 
which is in direct series with the chronoscope, thus starting the 
clock. The subject nearest the experimenter presses down his 
key as soon as he sees the experimenter’s finger move. His neigh- 
bor presses his key as soon as he is certain that he hears the click 
of the first subject’s key. He is to react to the sound of the key, 
and should have his attention upon the perception of the signal 
rather than upon carrying out the movement. He should also 
have his head turned away from the first subject so that he reacts 
to the sound of the click, and not to the perception of the move- 
ment of the first subject’s hand. 
The next subject reacts in the same manner, and then the next, 
and so on until all the subjects have pressed their keys. Each sub- 
ject must hold down his key until the last subject has reacted and the 
clock stops. The time required for the entire reaction is read from 
the clock and noted down. Ten trials are made in this manner. 
B. Motor Reaction. Proceed as before except that now the 
subjects’ attention is fixed on the act of closing their keys as 
quickly as possible rather than on the perception of the stimulus.
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE SIMPLE REACTION 107 
C. Mixed Reaction. This procedure is the same as the others 
except that the subjects now assume a less consciously directed 
attitude, the attention being distributed between the perception 
of the stimulus and the carrying out of the action. 
In all three types of reaction the attitude of the subjects as de- 
scribed above should be maintained throughout the ten trials. 
If time permits, the experiment may be repeated using a visual 
stimulus, viz. the movement of the hand in pressing the key, in- 
stead of the sound. 
Simplified Method 
Materials: Stop watch. 
Method: The subjects and experimenter form a chain, each one 
within touching distance of his neighbor. After a preparatory sig- 
nal the experimenter touches the right shoulder of the first sub- 
ject on his left, at the same time starting the stop watch. As soon 
as that subject feels the tap he taps his left-hand neighbor on the 
right shoulder. This subject taps the next, and so on until the last 
subject has been tapped. The watch is stopped as soon as the last 
touch is made. 
The three types of simple reaction are performed as in the pre- 
ceding method, the stimulus in each type being the feel of the tap, 
and the reaction the arm movement involved in tapping the next 
subject. Ten trials are made for each of the three types. 
Record: Tabulate the group reaction time for the ten trials under 
each of the three methods, and compute the average time and the 
m.v. for each of the three types of simple reaction. 
Questions: 1. Which type of reaction was the most rapid? Which 
the slowest? How do you explain this? 
2. Which type gave the greatest m.v.? Which the smallest? 
Explain. 
3. What evidences are there of practice effect? 
4. Name five practical activities in which a knowledge of re- 
action types would prove useful. Show how that knowledge would 
be of use in each case.

  108 VOLUNTARY ACTION 
2. The Discrimination Reaction (59) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Chronoscope, batteries, etc., wired as in the preced- 
ing experiment. 
Method: In this experiment the visual stimulus of the movement 
of the neighbor’s hand gives each subject his cue for reaction. The 
subject places both his hands near his telegraph key and presses 
the key with the opposite hand from that used by his neighbor, as 
explained below. 
To start the reaction the experimenter presses his key with 
either the right or the left hand (varying the hand used through- 
out the ten trials). If the first subject used his right hand, the 
second will react with his left, and the third with his right, and so 
on. The time is noted for the complete closing of the circuit. Ten 
trials are made. The subject should introspect on his ‘set’ to- 
ward the reaction? 
Simplified Method 
Materials: Stop watch. 
Method: The subjects are arranged in a chain, each with his 
back toward the preceding subject. The experimenter starts the 
reaction by tapping either the right or the left shoulder of the first 
subject. If the right shoulder is tapped, this subject taps the left 
shoulder of the next subject with his left hand. This last subject 
taps the right shoulder of the third subject with his right hand; 
and so on until all have reacted and the time has been taken. Ten 
trials are made, varying the shoulder touched by the experimenter 
in the successive trials. The subjects introspect on their attitude 
toward their reactions. 
Record: The group reaction times of the ten trials are to be tab- 
ulated, and the average and m.v. computed. 
Questions: 1. How does the average reaction time compare with 
that in the various simple reactions? Give an explanation for the 
difference.

4. There may have been certain individuals in the class who 
made many mistakes. For what occupations would they be un- 
fitted? Why?

  ASSOCIATION 
XIX. FREE CHAIN ASSOCIATION (60) 
Materials: Ruled paper providing space for one hundred words 
written in columns. Stop watch or watch with second hand. 
Method: The experimenter places a common word, such as ‘ win- 
dow,’ at the top of the prepared sheet of paper. The paper is 
then placed before the subject who, at a signal from the experi- 
menter, looks at the word and proceeds to write as rapidly as pos- 
sible all the words that occur to him, the first suggestion being 
given by the word at the top of the page. No sentences are to be 
formed. This is continued for three minutes, the time being kept 
by the experimenter. 
The subject, as soon as stopped by the experimenter, underlines 
all the words which seem to be connected with his personal expe- 
rience, that is, ‘ individualistic’ or ‘ ego-centric’ associations, 
such as music — joy; boy — street — accident; etc. 
He also marks with a cross all words which seem to have arisen 
in the mind without any recognizable connection with the preced- 
ing words. All the other words in the list might be said to be ob- 
jectively associated. These associations might have been formed 
by any of the other members of the class. Examples are cases of 
rhymes, and such associations as face — hand; barn — door; right 
— wrong; night — dark; etc. 
The subject now writes an introspective account, as far as he 
can remember, of all that was in mind in forming the associations, 
paying special attention to conscious suppressions and other in- 
termediate links between the words written. 
Record: Present the list of words marked as directed, together 
with their number, and the introspective account of the subject. 
Questions: 1. State the possible reasons for the variation of the

different subjects of the class in the number of words given in 
three minutes. 
2. Give an explanation of the arousal of words which seem to 
have no associational connection with the words they follow. 
3. Judging from the record would you say the subject is of an 
ego-centric or of an objective type? 
4. What practical applications can be made of this experiment?

XX. DETECTION OF SUPPRESSED IDEAS BY THE 
ASSOCIATION METHOD (61) 
(Class experiment) af 
Materials: Chronoscope in circuit with two sound keys, or stop 
watch. 
Method: This experiment studies one of the problems in the 
application of psychology to the detection of crime. Its object 
is to find out which of two people is guilty of a certain deed, by 
means of the analysis of association reaction times and the qual- 
ity of words associated. The commission of the ‘crime’ is ar- 
ranged after the following manner: Two subjects are selected, and 
are given a sealed envelope containing instructions for the crime. 
The two subjects leave the room and decide between themselves 
which is to play the criminal. The ‘innocent’ subject waits in 
the hall or in an adjoining room until he is called. 
The ‘criminal’ now opens the envelope and follows the in- 
structions given. It is important that the innocent person should 
know nothing about the crime, and that no one but the two sub- 
jects should know which one is guilty. The crime, which should 
be arranged beforehand by the experimenter, should preferably 
be one which arouses a certain degree of ‘criminal consciousness.’ 
The following is given as a model for the instruction in the envelope. 
“Go into room —, and there you will find in the desk drawer 
a sealed letter addressed to one of the members of the class. Open 
it, tearing the envelope as little as possible, and read the contents 
carefully. Then replace the letter in the envelope and, with the aid 
of the mucilage you will find on the desk, reseal the flap of the 
envelope neatly so as to avoid detection. Then put the letter back 
in its original place in the drawer. 
“ When you are called into the classroom for the experiment use 
all your ingenuity to conceal your guilty knowledge of the crime.”
-P-A-G-E-131
  DETECTION OF SUPPRESSED IDEAS 113 
In a crime of this sort the letter should reveal some very per- 
sonal, though fictitious affair of the student to whom it was ad- 
dressed, such as financial difficulties or a paternal reprimand for 
debts and extravagance, etc. 
After the instructions have been carried out, the ‘criminal’ 
joins the ‘innocent’ subject and awaits summons from the 
‘court.’ 
In the meantime the experimenter informs the class of the details 
of the crime. A list of fifty common words has been prepared be- 
forehand by the experimenter. Of these words twenty-five are 
closely related to the details of the crime. Such words are called 
“crucial words.’ The crucial words should be distributed through- 
out the list, some occurring singly, others in groups of from three 
to five. A partial list is given below as an illustration, supposing 
the crime to have been the one described (though actually a to- 
tally different crime must be prepared): 
  chair disk church 
hat black fork 
horse supper coffee 
man broom mucilage 
dinner pencil drawer 
keys letter money 
watch open expense 
window debts etc; 
envelope tree 
telephone school 
One of the subjects is now called in and seated facing the class. 
The experimenter speaks the first word of the list distinctly, and 
the subject replies as quickly as possible with the first word 
that comes into his mind. If chronoscope and sound keys are 
used, the words are spoken by each into their respective sound 
keys, the experimenter thus starting and the subject stopping the 
chronoscope.  
-P-A-G-E-132
II4 DETECTION OF SUPPRESSED IDEAS 
  If a stop watch is used the experimenter starts it as he says the 
stimulus word, and stops it as the subject speaks the reaction word. 
The class writes down the stimulus words and the reaction words, 
with their respective reaction times, as they are given.' After the 
fifty words have been presented to this subject he leaves the room. 
The other subject is then called in and the list repeated in the same 
manner to him. The members of the class are not to laugh nor 
otherwise disturb the subject. 
{If time allows repeat the list to the two subjects as before. If 
a physician’s sphygmomanometer (blood pressure apparatus) can 
be obtained, it will be interesting to compare the blood pressure 
curves of the guilty and innocent subjects.]

Give also the difference between the average crucial and the 
average non-crucial reaction times for each subject, and express 
it asa per cent of the average of the subject’s non-crucial reaction

Next state the difference between the mean variation for the 
crucial and non-crucial words for each subject. 
Finally, write down the name of the person whom you consider 
guilty, and make a summary of your reasons. The following points 
are to be considered as possible evidences of guilt: 
(1) Greater crucial difference than that of the other subject. 
(2) Greater mean variation in reaction time to the crucial than 
to the non-crucial words. 
(3) Occurrence of unusually long reaction time in isolated cases. 
(4) Reaction words connected with details of the crime. 
(5) Unysual associations. 
(6) Misunderstanding of the stimulus word. 
(7) Association of nonsense words. 
(8) Complete inhibition of reaction word so that no response is 
given. 
(9) Evidence of a plan of reaction pre-arranged by the subject. 
The verdict must be based on the entire mass of psychological 
evidence, and not on one or two criteria alone. 
If a reproduction of the list is made, make another table, 
starring all the reactions to crucial words which differ from the 
reaction word given in the first test. Find the crucial difference 
and mean variation difference as before. The reproduction tests 
may furnish the following further evidences of the subject’s 
guilt: 
(x) Greater crucial difference than that of the other subject. 
(2) Greater mean variation for crucial than for non-crucial words. 
(3) Failure to reproduce the original words given in the first 
test as reactions to the crucial words. 
[If the blood pressure is taken it is probable that the curve of 
the guilty subject will show greater irregularities than that of the 
innocent. For example, some experiments have shown that a sense 
of guilt produces a high blood pressure just before the reaction ex- 
periment, which drops gradually during the course of the test.] 
Questions: 1. Explain all the phenomena noted in your record 
under the nine possibilities mentioned above as evidences of guilt.
-P-A-G-E-134

statement with the objective record obtained. 
3. Explain the advantage of presenting some of the crucial 
words in groups rather than singly.

MEMORY 
XXI. ROTE MEMORY 
1. Memory Span for Digits (62) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: (To be prepared by the experimenter.) Strips of 
cardboard three inches wide, on which are pasted gummed paper 
digits about 13 inches in height. The digits may also be stamped 
or printed. The cardboard strips are to contain respectively 
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, 
fourteen, and fifteen digits. The digits are placed in a row on each 
card, and are so chosen that on a single card no two digits occur in 
their usual numerical order, nor is any digit repeated until all have 
been used from 1 to 9. 
Four such series of twelve cards each should be made. Two of 
the series, however (those for methods A and D following) may be 
merely written on a sheet of paper instead of prepared on cards. 
The four series should differ in the arrangement of digits in the 
successive cards or rows. 
Method: A. Auditory Perception. The experimenter reads aloud, 
slowly and distinctly, the four digit row of one of the series writ- 
ten on paper. There should be an interval of one second between 
the reading of the digits. Immediately thereafter the subjects 
write down the digits as remembered by them. This is repeated 
with rows of increasing length until the number of digits is reached 
which no student is able exactly to reproduce. Each subject con- 
tinues the test to the end even though he has failed in the repro- 
duction. 
B. Visual Perception. The experimenter proceeds as in A ex- 
cept that, instead of reading the rows aloud, he holds the cards 
up successively before the subjects who read the digits silently. 
The subjects again write down the rows as they are remembered.

C. Auditory, Visual, and Kinesthetic Perception. This time

unison. 
D. Auditory, Visual, and Motor Perception. The experimenter 
now reads the other series written on paper as in method A. The 
subjects write them down as they are being read. Immediately 
thereafter each subject turns his paper over and writes them down 
as he remembers them. 
A different series is used for each of the four methods. The rows 
of digits are now reread for each series, and the students examine 
their work, placing a cross after the row containing the highest 
number of digits which they reproduced fully and in their cor- 
rect order in each of the four methods. 
Record: Present the series as you have written them down, with 
the cross marks as directed above. 
Questions: 1. Rank your memory spans in the order of their 
length for the four methods used, and give reasons for the position 
of the different methods in this rank. 
2. From a survey of the records of the class, which form of per- 
ception would you consider the most conducive to remembering? 
3. State practical applications of the facts disclosed by this ex- 
periment.

MEMORY SPAN FOR NONSENSE AND SENSE WORDS IIQ 
2. Memory Span for Nonsense and Sense Words (63) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: (To be prepared by the experimenter.) Seven lists 
of syllables without meaning, the successive lists having an in- 
creasing number of syllables, from four in the first list to ten in 
the seventh. These syllables are to be composed of three letters 
each, a vowel between two consonants, and are to be devised 
according to the following rules. In a single list: 
(t) No consecutive syllables should make a sense word. 
(2) The same vowel should not occur in two consecutive syllables. 
(3) Notwo consecutive syllables should begin with the same letter. 
(4) No two syllables should have two letters identical. 
(5) The final letter of one syllable should not be the initial letter 
of the next. 
Eight lists of sense words also are to be made, containing re- 
spectively four, five, six, seven, etc., up to twelve words. Each 
word is to consist of a vowel between two consonants. The words 
in each list are selected so as to fulfill the five rules given above for 
nonsense syllables. 
Method: The nonsense lists are read aloud by the experimenter, 
as the digits were read in method A of the preceding experiment, 
the subjects writing down what they remember after the reading 
of each list. This is followed after a short rest by a similar presen- 
tation of the lists of sense words. The results are checked as be- 
fore, each student starring the longest sense list and the longest 
nonsense list which he reproduced without omission. It is not re- 
quired that the spelling of the nonsense syllables be exact. 
Record: Present the lists as you have written them, with those 
starred which indicate your memory span. 
Questions: 1. State numerically your memory span for sense 
and for nonsense lists, and explain the reason for the difference. 
2. Is your variation from the class average in span for sense 
words approximately the same as your variation in span for non- 
sense syllables? If not, give reasons for the difference.
-P-A-G-E-138
XXII. LOGICAL MEMORY 
1. Comparison of Rote and Logical Memory (64) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: Two lists, each containing fifteen monosyllabic sense 
words, are prepared by the experimenter. In one of the lists the 
words are unrelated, in the other they are related to some central 
idea, such as skating, as in the sample lists given below: 
ball 
tree 
house 
fox 
book 
fence 
sieve 
black 
thin 
sky 
pipe 
trip 
song 
spoon 
wire ice 
pond 
cold 
skate 
race 
edge 
snow 
smooth 
stars 
wind 
steel 
thin 
crack 
glide 
sharp Method: The experimenter reads 
the unrelated list distinctly, at 
the rate of one word per second. 
The subjects immediately there- 
after write down as many of the 
words as they can remember, re- 
gardless of order. This is re- 
peated, using the related words. 
Record: Present the two lists 
as remembered by you. 
Questions: 1. Give reasons for 
the difference in the length of the 
two lists remembered, and de- 
scribe what went on in your con- 
sciousness during the hearing and 
the recalling of the words. 
2. State and account for the probable effect of reading the lists 
at a more rapid rate. 
3. Explain the practical importance of the individual differ- 
ences you may find in the class in regard to the comparative grasp 
of related and unrelated words.
-P-A-G-E-139
  REPRODUCTION OF CONNECTED IDEAS 121 
2. Reproduction of Connected Ideas (65) 
(Class experiment) 
Materials: A literary description of about one hundred words, 
and containing a large number of concrete details, is selected by 
the experimenter. He indicates the distinct ideas by underlining 
each concrete object and each distinct word or phrase which quali- 
fies an object, as in the following example: 
.The day is steeped in the haze of summer merging into autumn;   
a distinct bloom of atmosphere, like the ruddy tints of a peach,   
settles over hill and valley, mingled with the rich yellow hues 
of dust and golden sunshine, while innumerable purple clusters 
of ripening grapes glimmer richly amidst the shriveled leaves 
of the vineyards. A fair land extends beyond the opening valleys   
  
  
  
with the city and sea sparkling below. In season, chestnut, oak,   
and willow trees have budded; and in the spring, almond, peach,   
and cherry have bloomed in clouds of rosy and snowy blossoms. 
Method: The experimenter reads the description slowly and dis- 
tinctly. The class listens attentively and at the end of the reading 
each subject writes as exact a reproduction of it as he can. When 
they have finished, the description is re-read and the various ideas 
indicated by pauses in the reading. The subjects underline the 
ideas which they have reproduced in their descriptions. Ideas 
are underlined which are given either in the original words, or in 
words equivalent in meaning. It is not required that the details 
be reproduced in their exact original order. 
Record: Present the reproduced description, underlined as de- 
scribed, and give the number of separately underlined ideas. 
Questions: 1. From a comparison of your results with the class 
averages, do you rank higher in the class in your rote memory or 
in your logical memory? 
2. Compare the mental factors involved in this experiment with 
those involved in hearing and recalling the second list of the pre- 
ceding experiment. 
3. What parts of the description were best remembered? Why?

  XXIII. MEMORY AND THE LEARNING PROCESS 
1. Effect of Length of Series on Learning and Retention (66) 
Materials: Tachistoscope with shutter open. If this has not been 
obtained or made, a piece of cardboard 5 x 8 inches, with a slit 2 
inches long and one half inch wide, can be used. Metronome. 
Four lists of three-letter nonsense syllables are made by the 
experimenter, following in the construction of each list the rules 
given under the second experiment in rote memory. Two of these 
lists are to be of eight syllables, and two of fourteen. The same 
syllable must not occur twice throughout the entire four lists; and 
it is well to have the lists as dissimilar as possible. The experi- 
menter prints the lists on strips of paper in the usual way for use 
in the tachistoscope. It is important that the subject does not see 
any of the syllables until they are presented. 
Method: A. Learning. The experimenter places an eight-syllable 
list in the tachistoscope (or behind the window of the cardboard) 
in such a way that the first syllable only is exposed. The metro- 
nome is set for the class at 60, and the experimenter pulls the list 
gradually across the opening, exposing one syllable at every second 
click of the metronome. If a metronome is not available, he may 
use an estimated interval of two seconds between syllables. 
As each syllable comes into view the subject reads it in a very low 
voice, until all have been exposed. The list is then repeated and 
the subject reads as before. He should, however, try as far as he 
is able to recall each syllable before its appearance at the window. 
The list is repeated in this manner until learned, that is, until the 
subject can recall in the same repetition every syllable correctly 
before its appearance. 
The number of repetitions required, not including the first one 
correctly anticipating the list, is noted by the experimenter. The 
experiment is repeated for the other lists, learning first one of the
-P-A-G-E-141
LENGTH OF SERIES AND LEARNING 123 
fourteen-syllable lists, then the other fourteen, and finally the other 
eight-syllable list. 
B. Retention. (Saving Method.) After the experiment de- 
scribed above, the lists should be kept by the experimenter, and 
the subject should neither see them nor think of the syllables. 
At the next meeting of the course the subject relearns the lists in 
the same order, and in the same manner as before. The number 
of required repetitions is noted. 
Record: Present the nonsense lists used. For A give the aver- 
age number of repetitions required for the two eight-syllable lists, 
and the average for the two fourteen lists. Express the ratio of 
these averages to the number of syllables in the lists respectively. 
For B find the average saving of repetitions in relearning the 
eight-syllable lists, and the average saving in the fourteen-syllable 
lists. Express these savings as per cents of the average number 
of repetitions required in the original learning of the lists respec- 
tively. 
Questions: 1. Discuss your results under A, giving reasons for 
the difference in the ratios obtained. 
2. Did practice have any effect on the learning of the lists? If 
so, what? Is there also practice effect shown in the relearning? 
3. In your results under B, if the percentages differ, give rea- 
sons for the difference. Do you think overlearning might have 
played a part here? If so, how? 
4. Why were nonsense syllables used in this experiment? 
*o. What other methods of investigating memory with non- 
sense syllables are used in experimental psychology?
-P-A-G-E-142
  
  124 MEMORY AND THE LEARNING PROCESS 
2. Unconscious Associations (67) 
Materials: Exposure apparatus as in the preceding experiment. 
Two lists of fourteen, three-letter nonsense syllables devised as 
before. 
Method: The subject learns the two lists as in method A of the 
preceding experiment. The number of repetitions required is noted. 
The experimenter now rearranges these syllables, forming two 
other lists as follows: The first list should contain the first, third, 
fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth syllables of each 
original list. The second should contain the second, fourth, sixth, 
eighth, tenth, twelfth and fourteenth of each original list. For 
example, if the two original lists are respectively I, I, I, I, I, etc. 
and II, II, I, I, II, etc., the derived lists will be as follows: 
Gist Aw lselgMlenl, To Aer Ny, LL, LL, shi Ue 
Dist Beds D6 ts Lode, U1, ey Wal, f ll, 
List A is now learned by the subject in the usual manner, and 
the number of repetitions noted. 
It is possible that in this learning the intermediate syllables, 
I, I, etc., as learned in the original list, were unconsciously 
“stirred up.’ To prove this the subject now learns list B which is 
composed of these intermediate syllables, in order to find whether 
this requires fewer repetitions than A. In other words, this will 
show whether while learning list A he has been unconsciously 
strengthening the memory of list B. 
Record: Present the four lists with the number of repetitions re- 
quired for each. 
Questions: 1. What is meant by ‘remote association,’ and how 
may it have played a part in this experiment? 
2. What other factor may have aided in making it possible to 
learn B with fewer repetitions than A? 
*3. What method might be used to test the memory value for 
syllables intrinsically, that is individually and apart from associa- 
tional connection? 
4. Describe a method for testing the memory value of various 
degrees of remote associations.

BERBER ERE ES REE ES Ease 
Method: The members of the class are to study the process of 
learning by translating into the wireless code a given text for defi- 
nite periods each day throughout two weeks. A text should be 
chosen from any book accessible to the whole class. In translat- 
ing, instead of making, for example, a short and a long dash, make 
a short perpendicular line and a long dash. Thus C would be 
written —- | —— | By using short perpendicular marks instead 
of short dashes confusion of long and short dashes is avoided. 
One half of the class should work ten minutes in the morning 
of each day; the other half five minutes in the morning and five 
minutes in the afternoon of each day. Work always at your high- 
est speed in order to make as good a record as possible. Be care- 
ful to leave a space between the different groups of dots and 
dashes representing letters. After each period of work count and 
note the number of letters translated. Put down also the date 
and hour of working.
-P-A-G-E-144
  126 MEMORY AND THE LEARNING PROCESS 
Record: Present the results in the form of a curve, the horizon- 
tal axis indicating the successive days, and the vertical axis the 
number of letters translated. 
The group of subjects who work twice daily should plot two 
curves, one for morning and the other for afternoon work. These 
curves should be plotted on the same axes, the one in red, the 
other in black. Figure 33 is an example of two such curves. 
Since you will doubtless translate more than fifty letters in the 
first five minutes, it will be well to start with 50 as the first point 
on the vertical axis. The succeeding points may be arranged in 
steps of five.

Questions: 1. Give an explanation of the variations in the ascent 
of your learning curve, together with an introspective account of 
your method of learning and applying the code. 
Curves showing the learning process in typewriting, etc., have
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE LEARNING CURVE 127 
contained ‘ plateaus,’ that is, intervals during which there was 
no progress. These periods are generally followed by a decided 
rise. If such plateaus occur in your. curve, include these in your 
explanation. 
2. Those students who have worked twice daily are to com- 
pare the ascent of their morning and afternoon curves, and to 
state which half of the day they consider most favorable for mem- 
orizing. They are to discuss also the various factors which may 
account for the differences in the curves. 
3. From a comparison of the class record of attainment of those 
who worked twice daily with the attainment of those who worked 
only once daily, what can you suggest in regard to the most effi- 
cacious methods of learning in general?

  XXIV. RECOGNITION AND DISCRIMINATION IN 
MEMORY 
1. Recognition (69) 
Materials: Watch with second hand. Twenty lists of ten dissyl- 
labic words each are prepared by the experimenter. Each list is 
written very plainly on a separate slip of paper, and the lists are 
to be arranged in ten pairs, A, A,, B, B,, etc., according to the 
following scheme: The second list of each pair is to have one word 
identical, except for one letter, with the word which occupies the 
same position in the first list. The other nine words of the second 
list are to be entirely different from those of the first. An example 
  of one of the ten pairs of lists, showing the arrangement of the 
words, is given in figure 34. The fourth word in the first row pre- 
sents the similarity mentioned. 
All ten pairs of lists are made in this manner, except that the 
position of the similar word is changed in each pair, using each of 
the ten positions. Further examples of such similar words are: 
retort, report ; wander, wonder ; shiver, shaver ; etc. 
Method: The experimenter places the first member of one of the 
pairs of lists, covered with a paper, on the table before the subject. 
After a preparatory signal, ‘ now,’ he removes the paper and al- 
lows the subject to scrutinize the list for six seconds. The second
-P-A-G-E-147
  RECOGNITION 129 
list is then exposed in like manner for six seconds. The subject 
examines this second list trying to find the word which is similar 
to a word in the first list. If he succeeds, he names this word and 
also, if possible, the corresponding word in the first list. These 
words are noted down by the experimenter. 
The procedure is repeated using the other nine pairs of lists, 
allowing a short rest between pairs. 
Record: Present the words of the second lists which the subject 
recognized as similar to words in the respective first lists, and 
opposite each the word of the first list if it was correctly recalled. 
Indicate also the position in its list of each of the similar words 
recognized. 
Questions: 1. It has been asserted that in order to recognize 
similarity and difference we must have both the objects in mind 
for comparison. Criticize this statement from your results, and 
state what various degrees of completeness in the recognition of 
likeness and difference are possible. 
2. Give examples from everyday life of these different degrees 
of recognition. 
3. What positions seem especially to favor recognition? What 
practical applications can be made of this fact? 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
I30 RECOGNITION AND DISCRIMINATION IN MEMORY 
2. Discrimination (70) 
Materials: Watch with second hand. Ten pairs of lists of ten 
dissyllabic words each are prepared by the experimenter. They 
are written on slips of paper as in the preceding experiment. This 
time, however, the second list of each pair is identical with the 
first list, except for one word which is altered by changing one 
letter. The position of the altered word should be different in each 
pair of lists. 
Method: The method is the same as that in the preceding experi- 
ment, except that this time the subject is to look in the second list 
for the word which has been changed, and is to try to discover 
what the change is. The experimenter notes the results as before. 
Record: As in the preceding experiment present the words dis- 
criminated by the subject, with the original word in each case if 
correctly recalled, and their positions in the lists. 
Questions: 1. From the results of these last two experiments 
state whether you find it easier to recall a similarity when the 
surroundings are different, or to discriminate a difference when 
the surroundings are identical. 
*2, What other attitude might the subject take toward the lists 
in this experiment? 
3. From the introspection and results in this experiment what 
can you offer further in regard to the statement made in the first 
question of the preceding experiment?

IMAGERY 
XXV. KINDS AND VIVIDNESS OF IMAGERY (71) 
(Individual experiment) 
Method: The purpose of this experiment is to ascertain whether 
you can call to mind various sensory experiences of the different 
senses, and if so, in what terms (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, etc.) 
and how vividly. These reproduced sensory experiences of the vari- 
ous senses are called ‘centrally aroused sensations,’ or ‘ imagery.’ 
Sit quietly and try to imagine the following experiences. Grade 
the vividness of each image on a scale ranging from one (a very 
dim or weak image) to five (an image as vivid as in actual per- 
ception). In the first group try to have your imagery purely in 
visual terms, for in this group only the visual imagery is to be 
graded. In the second group try to produce purely auditory imag- 
ery, and grade for the auditory form; and so on.

association give similar evidence to support your ranking of the 
various forms of imagery? 
2. How might you make practical use of your results in this 
experiment? 
3. If in the free chain association experiment you were to find 
a predominance of verbs, what explanation could you give?

tory or visual? Test this by finding how many distinct and un- 
related images you can form in one half minute for each of these

  XXVI. IMAGINAL TYPES (72) 
(Individual experiment) 
Method: Each subject is to solve mentally the following prob- 
lem, paying attention to the kind of imagery he uses. 
Imagine a three-inch cube painted green on all sides. Suppose 
this cube were to be cut into small cubes of one inch each. Imagine 
how this division of the cube would be made. How many of the 
small cubes now formed have paint on three sides; how many 
on two sides; how many on one; and how many not at all? 
Record: Give your solution and an introspective account of the 
imagery involved in solving the problem. 
Questions: 1. From a survey of the class records, into what 
imaginal types would you say the individuals may be grouped? 
Which type predominates, and which type gave the most cor- 
rect answers? 
2. How many of the class could not solve the problem? How 
do you account for their failure? 
3. Name three practical situations in which you would use the 
same kind of imagery as in this experiment.
-P-A-G-E-153
  
XXVII. IMAGERY AND VOLUNTARY SUPPRESSION (73) 
Method: The subject is to count aloud up to twenty-five, omit- 
ting five numbers which are to be previously designated by the 
experimenter. For example, the experimenter says: ‘“‘ Count from 
one to twenty-five, omitting four, nine, twelve, seventeen, and 
twenty-three.” The subject follows the instructions, counting 
in a low voice, and introspecting on all the imagery involved. 
For this purpose he divides the introspection into three periods, 
— that for the fore period, the main period, and the after period. 
The fore period is that immediately following the instruction, and 
in which he becomes ‘ set’ for the task; the main period is the 
actual counting; the after period is that immediately following the 
counting. 
In the fore period the subject pays attention to the form in 
which he holds the instruction in mind, and to the manner in which 
he prepares to perform the task. In the main period he observes 
whether the numbers to be inhibited come to consciousness, and 
if so, in what form. In the after period he notes any imagery in- 
volved in his consciousness of the success or failure of the task. 
The experimenter notes down the introspection as given by the 
subject. 
The experiment is now repeated using the letters of the alphabet, 
omitting five letters as directed by the experimenter. Introspec- 
tion is obtained as in the preceding task. 
Repeat the experiment again having the subject count back- 
ward from twenty-five, omitting five numbers which should be 
different from those omitted in the first exercise. 
Record: (x) Present the three series with numbers and letters 
omitted, indicating any failures that may have occurred. 
(2) For each of the three tasks, give the three introspective

accounts (for fore period, main period, and after period), as re- 
ported by the subject. 
Questions: (1) From a study of your results discuss the functional 
value of imagery in the voluntary suppression of ideas. 
(2) Describe the imagery involved in a muscular act of ‘ will,’ 
such as throwing a ball at a mark.

  AFFECTION 
XXVIII. METHOD OF IMPRESSION 
1. Comparative Affective Value of Single Colors (74) 
Materials: Ten one-inch squares of paper of the following colors: 
(fully saturated) red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple; (unsat- 
urated) pink, light green, light blue, light violet. 
A piece of neutral gray cardboard six inches square in which are 
cut two windows three quarters of an inch square, placed side by 
side about one inch apart. 
Method: The purpose of this experiment is to find the order of 
preference for a series of colors. To do this the subject must com- 
pare separately each color with every other color. The experi- 
menter places the red square behind the left window of the card- 
board which rests flat on the table. He places an orange square 
behind the right window. When he signals ‘ready’ the subject 
looks at the two colors and decides which is the more pleasant. 
The experimenter notes this preference by making a mark oppo- 
site the name of the preferred color in a table of all the colors. 
Red is then compared in the same way with each of the other 
colors, and the preferences noted as before. The subject rests — 
closed eyes between the comparisons. 
Orange is now compared in the same manner with every other 
color except red; yellow is compared with every other color except 
red and orange; and so on until all possible comparisons have 
been made. This is knownas the method of ‘ paired comparison.’ 
The entire experiment is now repeated, the experimenter this 
time placing the standard color always behind the right window, 
and the comparison color behind the left. By reversing the posi- 
tions of standard and comparison colors which obtained in the 
first procedure we thus offset the space error, — that is, the tend-
-P-A-G-E-156
  138 METHOD OF IMPRESSION 
ency to judge the color to the right (or to the left) always as the 
more pleasant. The marks for preferences are placed in the same 
table as in the first procedure. 
The subject introspects throughout the experiment upon the 
factors which influence his judgments of preference. 
Record: A. Individual. Present the table with the marks indi- 
cating color preferences in the two methods of presentation. Count 
the number of marks for each color, and place the numbers in their 
proper places in the table. Paste the colors in the notebook in 
order of preference as indicated by the respective preference to- 
tals. [If the subject uses the colors for his notebook, the experi- 
menter may simply write the names of the calls in the preference 
order.] 
            
  
  
  
  
      B. Class. The order of preference of the colors for the class as

from D, etc. Orange received first place from both A and B, third 
place from C, ninth from D, and so on. It is evident that the 
smaller the sum given at the right of the table for any color, the 
higher that color stands in the order of class preference. 
The names of the colors are now listed in the order of preference, 
the first color being that which received the smallest sum, the last 
being that which received the largest sum. 
Questions: 1. From the results, individual and class, state the 
relation which exists between the affective value of colors and — 
(a) their hue; 
(b) their degree of saturation; 
(c) their degree of brightness. 
2. From the subject’s introspection state the subjective fac- 
tors which influence preference, such as — 
(a) ‘ dirty ’ appearance of colors; 
(b) ‘ coldness’ or ‘ warmth’; 
(c) associations, such as dark green calling up a pleasant trip 
on water, etc.; 
(d) personal characteristics suggested by the color, such as 
jealousy, innocence, dignity, etc. 
3. From the subject’s introspection give also an account of 
physiological states which may have been produced by the affec- 
tive reaction. Examples of such states are quickened pulse, al- 
tered respiration, empathic movements, etc. 
4. You have arranged the colors in the order of your preference. 
Is the series as a whole the most pleasing arrangement possible? 
Discuss this. 
5. As far as possible account for the differences you find be- 
tween your order of preference and that of the class.

2. Comparative Affective Value of Color Combinations (78) 
Materials: Five one-inch squares of each of the following colors: 
(saturated) red, yellow, green, blue; (unsaturated) light pink, 
light blue. Two cards with windows, similar to the card used in 
the preceding experiment. 
Method: The experimenter lays out the colors in pairs, in a 
convenient place out of the subject’s sight, making all possible 
combinations, each pair consisting of two different colors. There 
will be fifteen pairs. Write the names or initials of the colors as 
combined in the respective pairs in a table. For example: 
RY 
RG 
RB 
etc. 
The experimenter places the two cardboards side by side on the 
table, putting one pair of colors beneath the windows of the right- 
hand card, and another pair beneath the windows of the left. 
Each color pair is to be compared with every other color pair in 
the same manner as the single colors were compared, and the pref- 
erences noted in each comparison by a mark in the table. 
If time is limited, this experiment need not be repeated with 
changed relative positions of the standard and comparison pairs, 
as was done previously with single colors to eliminate space 
error. 
Record: (x) Present the table of the subject’s preferences, with 
the number of marks for each pair counted and recorded. 
(2) The color combinations are pasted in the notebook in the 
order of the subject’s preference. 
Questions: 1. Can you show from your results that the affective 
value of color combinations is dependent on the relative hues of 
the colors combined? On the relative brightness? On the relative 
saturation? If so, what laws can you formulate to cover these 
points?
-P-A-G-E-159
  AFFECTIVE VALUE OF COLOR COMBINATIONS I41 
2. Does your preference for single colors appear to affect your 
preferences in the combinations? If so, how? 
3. From introspection give reasons for your preferences for some 
of the color combinations. 
Note: If time permits, further comparative affective values may be studied, using 
series of odors, or of tastes, or a series of tactual stimuli consisting of sample textures 
such as wool, sandpaper, tin, silk, etc., glued to the bottoms of small boxes.

3. Affective Value of the Relative Position of Colors [Apparent 
Heaviness of Colors] (76) 
(Individual experiment) 
Materials: Colored papers: red, green, dark blue, yellow. 
Method: Cut out four triangles 14 inches high, each formed of 
two colors in the proportions shown in figure 35. In the four tri- 
angles the colors are as follows: 
Triangle no. 1. Lower half ‘yellow, upper 
half blue. 
Triangle no. 2. Lower half blue, upper 
half yellow. 
Triangle no. 3. Lower half green, upper 
half red. 
Triangle no. 4. Lower half red, upper half 
green. 
In each triangle the altitudes of the up- 
per and lower sections are $ and § inch 
respectively. 
Paste the triangles in the notebook, (1) and (2) side by side, 
and (3) and (4) side by side. Hold them up vertically before you 
and judge which arrangement is the more pleasing in each of the 
two pairs. 
If time permits repeat the experiment using other pairs of figures 
as shown in figure 36. Try to account for the presence or the ab- 
sence of the phenomenon in each pair.

Record: Indicate your preference in the notebook for each pair 
of triangles, and state which pair offered the greatest difference in 
affective value between its two triangles. 
Questions: 1. From your results formulate a law covering the 
phenomenon of apparent heaviness of colors.

AFFECTIVE VALUE OF RELATIVE POSITION OF COLORS 143 
2. From your introspection state the reason for your preference 
in each pair. 
3. What applications can be made of this phenomenon? 
4. Does the affective value change with associative interpre- 
tations of the figures? Test this by imagining that one of the 
squares shown in figure 36 represents a window with the shade 
halfway down, or the horizon at sea, etc. 
5. Do you think that this phenomenon depends on the rela- 
tive brightness, relative saturation, or relative hues of the colors?

4. Comparative Affective Value of Linear Proportions (77) 
Materials: A set of six cards, each 12 X 2 inches, is prepared as 
follows by the experimenter. Each card contains a line 943 inches 
long, and each of these lines is divided into two parts. The divi- 
sion occurs at a different point on each card. A sample of one of 
re 
Fic. 37. 
these cards is shown (reduced size) in figure 37. The six lines are 
to be divided as follows: 
Card 1. Bisection. 
Card 2. The division mark two thirds of the distance from the 
left end. 
Card 3. The division mark three quarters of the distance from 
the left end. 
Card 4. The division mark 6g inches from the left end. 
Card 5. The division mark one quarter of an inch to the left of 
that in card 4. 
Card 6. The division mark one quarter of an inch to the right 
of that in card 4. 
The division of card 4 represents approximately the Golden Sec- 
tion. That is, the smaller part is to the larger as the larger is to the 
whole line. The actual proportion here is 3$:675 = 6q5:944. 
The cards are lettered from (a) to (f), but not in the order here 
given, for the subject must not know which proportions are desig- 
nated by the different letters. 
Method: The six different divisions of the same line are to be 
arranged by the subject in order of preference, using the method 
of paired comparison. The experimenter presents each card in 
turn with every other card, and the subject indicates his prefer- 
ence as in the experiment with colors. The preferences are noted 
by marks in a table containing the letters of the cards.

erence marks and their sum for each line division. Give also the 
arrangement of the six cards in order of the subject’s preference 
(from the table), stating in the case of each card what proportions 
the division represents. 
B. Class. The results of the class’s first and second choices are 
to be arranged in the following tabular form. As each of the di- 
visions is called, the subjects indicate by a show of hands how 
many gave it the first, and how many the second position. In this 
table the cards are numbered as they are under ‘materials.’

XXIX. METHOD OF EXPRESSION 
1. Feeling Tone and Motor Activity (78) 
Materials: A metric rule. Unruled paper. 
Method: The subject brings to mind a rather strong emotional 
situation, preferably one he has experienced. This emotional state 
must have a decidedly pleasant feeling tone. Still thinking of this 
pleasant situation he draws free-hand a horizontal line of any length 
on the unruled paper. The experimenter then removes the paper 
and gives the subject a similar sheet on which he draws a line 
which seems to him to be of the same length as the first line. This 
time, however, he thinks of an emotional situation which has a 
decidedly unpleasant feeling tone. 
Now the subject thinks first of an unpleasant situation and draws 
a line as before. The same unpleasant situation as was employed 
in the first pair of lines may be used, provided it does not lose its 
emotional strength by repetition. He then reproduces this line, 
thinking of a pleasant situation which also may be the same as 
that used in the first trial unless it has lost its strength. 
Ten such pairs of lines are drawn, with short rests between 
pairs. They should be alternated so that if in the one pair the 
‘unpleasant’ line comes first, in the next pair the ‘ pleasant’ 
line is the one first drawn. The lines should vary in length from 
four to ten inches. 
The emotional states should be kept vividly in mind by the 
subject while drawing the lines. He should in each case think of 
the situation for a short time before drawing the line, in order to 
“work up ’ the affective state. Care should be taken that he does 
not know the amount nor direction of his errors until the experi- 
ment is finished. He should not even form an opinion of the direc- 
tion in which his errors tend. 
To avoid confusion it will be well for the experimenter to label
-P-A-G-E-165
  
.FEELING TONE AND MOTOR ACTIVITY 147 
the successive pairs of lines as they are made. A convenient method 
of labeling is: A:, unpleasant; Az, pleasant. B:, pleasant; B2, un- 
pleasant; C:, unpleasant; C2, pleasant, — etc. 
Record: Present in the form of the table shown the length of the 
pleasant and unpleasant lines and the amount of their difference, 
in centimeters, for each trial. For each pair give also the per cent 
of the difference in terms of the length of the first line drawn in 
the pair.

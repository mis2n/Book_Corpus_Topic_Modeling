DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
To His Excellency, Gov. M. R. Patierson: 
‘The chief function of an annual report is to furnish as nearly 
as possible a correct standard of measurement for ascertaining 
our educational progress. 
The present biennial report in many respects furnishes unmis- 
takable evidence of rapid and substantial educational advance- 
ment during the past two years. 
THE GENERAL Epucation Biww. 
The General Education Bill passed by the last legislature 
unifies the school system, and provides for the growth and expan- 
sion of all its different parts. The State is interested alike in the 
full and harmonious development of all its schools. 
Tue ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
The function of the elementary school is to banish illiteracy 
from the State, and to prepare all the children of the State for 
good citizenship by giving them at least a rudimentary education. 
A large majority of our children never go beyond the elementary 
school, and for that reason the efforts of the Stafe Department 
have been very largely directed toward the improvement of the 
elementary rural schools. This can be more clearly shown by 
the following: 
In 1900 there were only 23. counties itt the State levying as 
much as 40 cents on the $100.00 worth of property for elementary 
schools; in 1905 there were 40 counties levying as much a 40 
cents school tax on the $100.00 worth property; in 1910 there are 
89 counties levying as much as 40 cents school tax on the $100.00 
worth of property. This shows a consistent and substantial 
growth in school interest for the past ten years. A similar growth 
is shown in the increase of the value of school property, teach- 
ers’ salaries, length of term.

The above tables, taken from the records, indicate more ex- 
plicitly what is being done for the elementary schools of the 
State than many written descriptive pages. 
The elementary schools are at present undergoing an evolu- 
tion; they are vet to be thoroughly and closely organized. A 
State graded course of study has been prepared, (a copy of which 
appeats elsewhere in this report), but no course of study is of 
much avail till it is understood, appreciated, and felt in every 
fiber of the public school teacher. 
County HicH ScHoots. 
Chapter 279 of the Acts of 1899 empowers the County Court. 
“to provide for establishing and maintaining one or more County 
High Schools for the instruction of the children of the County’, 
with a further proviso that a special high school tax may be 
levied in addition to other taxes for schools, not to exceed fifteen 
cents on the $100.00 worth of property. This Act made the high 
school strictly a Courity institution, operated and maintained 
wholly by the county, with practically no regulation or restric- 
tion as to what the cotrse of study should be. It could have 
been made only a secondary school, or if the Board of Education 
so willed, it might have a course of study co-extensive with the 
college. 
In order to define and limit its field, and to standardize and 
systematize the work, and to encourage counties to establish 
and maintain a system of high schools, Chapter 264 of the Acts 
of 1909 provides that: 
“It shall be the duty of the State Board of Education to grade 
ail high schools now established and maintained, or that in the 
future may be established and maintained under the provisions 
of the County High School Law; to prescribe their minimum 
courses of study, requiring the elements of agriculture and home
-P-A-G-E-63
— 45 — 
“economics to be taught in all schools; and to classify them as 
high schools of the first, second and third class.” 
Acting in conjunction with the State High School Inspector, 
all high schools have been classified by the State Board of Educa- 
tion, and furnished proper courses of study to meet the require- 
ments of the above Act. 
(A full statement of the High School work, prepared by the 
State High School Inspector, will be found elsewhere in this 
report.) o 
The function of the High School is to offer, free of cost, to 
every child an education that will fit the individual for good citi- 
zenship by better preparation for the various activities of life; 
to furnish the connecting link between the elementary school 
and the college or university; to perfect and unify the County - 
system of schools; to furnish better prepared rural teachers; to 
stimulate the elementary school by giving opportunity and en- 
couragement to the individual to go-higher, thus prolonging the 
period of school life. 
Stare NorMaL ScHOOLS. 
Section 7, Chapter 264, Acts 1909, provides: 
“That thirteen per cent of the General Education Fund pro- 
vided by this Act may be used for the establishment and main- 
tenance of Normal Schools solely for the education and profes- 
sional training of teachers for the elementary schools. of the State 
as herein provided. One Normal School for the education and 
professional training of white teachers shall be established and 
maintained in each Grand Division of the State, and shall be open 
and free alike to white males and females resident in the State 
of Tennessee; and one Agricultural and Industrial Normal School 
for the industrial education of negroes and for preparing negro 
teachers for common schools shall be established and main- 
tained, and shall be open and free alike to negro males and fe- 
males resident in the State of Tennessee; but no person shall be 
admitted to either of these schools who is under sixteen years of 
age and who has not finished at least the elementary school 
course prescribed for public schools of the State; nor shall any 
person be admitted to either of the Normal schools for white 
teachers who does not first sign a pledge to teach in the public or
-P-A-G-E-64
— 46 — 
private schools of the State of “Tennessee, within the next six” 
years after leaving the school, at least as long as he or she has 
attended said school. 
Each school established and maintained under the provis- 
ions of this section of this Act shall have connected with it one or 
_ tore practice and observation schools, in which shall be taught at 
least all the subjects prescribed for the primary schools of the State; 
and the County Boards of Education of any county, or the Dis- 
trict Directors of any school district, or the Board of Education 
of any incorporated city or town having a special school. system 
under the provisions of its charter may, and the same is hereby 
empowered to, contract with the State Board of Education to 
provide for the teaching of children of public-school age in such 
practice and observation scliools, and to pay to the said Normal 
“school all or any portion of the public school funa belonging to 
such county, district, or incorporated city or town, as agreed. 
upon by the school authorities of said county, school district, or 
incotporated city or town, and the State Board of Education, as 
in the case of consolidated schools under the provisions of the 
State school law. 
The principals and instructors in the Normal schools for the 
education and training ‘of white teachers may be required to 
assist in conducting Teachers’ Institutes in any of the counties 
of the Grand Division of the State in which said school is located. 
Provided, that no principal or instructor may thus be required 
to assist in institutes more than six weeks in any one year. 
Provided, further,.that no more than two inembers of the . 
faculty of any Normal school may be required to be absent from 
- the school for this purpose at the time. 
And, provided, further, that all such service shall be per- 
formed without additional pay, except that necessary traveling 
. expenses and hotel ‘bills while engaged in this service shall be 
paid out of the funds of the Normal school. 
_. A certificate of graduation from any one of the said Normal 
schools shall entitle the holder thereof to teach in any of the 
public schools.of the State without further examination for a 
-period of four years from the date of such certificate. Any such 
graduate: who completes within the said period of four years 
such additional courses of reading and study as may be prescribed 
- “by the State Board of Education and shall pass the required ex- ~

aminations in the same and has proven his ability as a teacher 
by teaching acceptably not less than fifteen months within this ° 
period may, upon application, be granted a permanent license to 
teach in any of the public elementary schools of the State. 
The course of study and the rules and regulations shall be 
the same for all the said Normal schools, with such minor modi- 
fications for any school as may be required by local conditions; 
provided, that such courses of study shall include instruction in 
ordinary English branches, in vocal music,. drawing, domestic 
science, manual training; elements of chemistry, physics, and 
biology; the elementary principles of agriculture, horticulture, 
and home economics; and in the history, principles, and. methods 
of education; and, provided, further, that the courses of study 
for the Agricultural and Industrial. Normal School for negroes 
shall be of such practical nature as to fit the conditions and needs 
of their race. 
‘The general management and control of all Normal schools 
established and maintained under the provisions of this section 
of this Act shall be vested in the State Board of Education; and 
the said State Board of Education shall have power to employ 
a bookkeeper, whose duty it shall be to keep the accounts of the 
Normal school funds as directed by the Board, and the salary 
shall be fixed by the Board and paid out of the Normal school 
fund herein provided before its apportionment to the several 
schools on the warrant of the Comptroller. All schools estab- 
lished under the provisions of this. section of this Act shall eb 
located by the State Board of Education; and in making such 
locations, said Board shall take into consideration accessibility, 
centrainess of position, healthfulness of location, cheapness. of 
living, opportunities for arranging for suitable practice and ob- 
servation of this Act, looking to the location and establishment 
of these schools, and to the opening of, the same at the earliest 
date practicable. 
All disbursements of money under the provisions of this sec- 
tion of this Act shall be made on the certificate of the President 
and Secretary of the State Board of Education, by the Comp- 
troller of the Treasury, in the manner prescribed by law for the 
disbursement of money to charitable institutions. 
Sec. 8. Be it further enacted, That for the year one thous- 
and nine hundred and nine and annually thereafter seven per cent
-P-A-G-E-66
— 48 — 
of the General Education Fund provided by this Act shall be, 
* and the-same is hereby, appropriated to the University of Tennes- 
see, to be used for the maintenance and improvement of the same, 
as the head of the public school system of the State, as the General 
Assembly of the State may from time to time direct by resolu- 
tion or enactment, or as the Board of Trustees of said University 
may elect. 
Provided, That ten per cent, but not less than ten thousand 
dollars ($10,000) annually, of the amount herein apportioned to 
the University of Tennessee shall be used for the maintenance 
of the Agricultural and Horticultural Experiment Station and 
Model Farm, located in West Tennessee; and five per cent, but 
not less than five thousand dollars annually, for the maintenance 
of co-operative agricultural experiments in Middle Tennessee. 
Provided, further, that an amount not exceeding five per 
cent of the sum apportioned annually to the University may be 
used to pay the traveling expenses of young men and women of 
Tennessee attending the University, under such rules and regu- 
lations. as the Board of Trustees of said University may adopt, 
but the traveling expenses of no student shall be paid who does 
not remain through the entire school year, nor shall the expenses 
of any student be paid more than once each way in. any year. . 
It will be seen that the above Act. does not furnish suffi- 
cient funds for the erection and equipment of buildings for the 
Normal schools, hence, an additional Act was passed, Chapter 
580, Acts 1909, whereby any county or municipality in Tennes- 
see may issue bonds to the amount of $100,000 for the purpose of 
erecting and equipping buildings. Twenty-one places submitted 
propositions for the location of one of the schools. 
In East Tennnessee the following towns and counties sub- 
mitted propositions: Johnson City and Washington County; 
Sweetwater and Monroe County; Cleveland and Bradley County; 
Dayton and Rhea County; Athens and McMinn County. 
In Middle Tennessee the following :towns and counties sub- 
mitted propositions: Winchester and Franklin County; Tulla- 
homa and Coffee County; Fayetteville and Lincoln County; 
Columbia and Maury County; Cookeville and Putnam County; 
Murfreesboro and Rutherford County; Clarksville and Montgom- 
ery County; Shelbyville and Bedford County; Monterey and 
Putnam County.
-P-A-G-E-67
In West Tennessee the following towns and counties submit- 
ted propositions: Huntingdon and Carroll County; Jackson and 
Madison County; McKenzie and Carroll County; Covington and 
Tipton County; Memphis and Shelby County; Humboldt and 
Gibson County. The towns of Trenton and Milan submitted 
propositions, but later withdrew in favor of Humboldt. 
The above towns and Counties all together submitted in 
money, lands and bonds more than three and a quarter millions 
of dollars. 
The Board set a date for visiting all competitive places. At 
every point large delegations of the best citizens of the town and 
county met the Board, and speeches were made by local repre- 
sentatives, setting forth the specific advantages of each place 
from the standpoint of its accessibility, centralness of location, 
healthfulness, moral tone of the community, and donations of- 
fered, etc. In addition to the arguments presented by the speak- 
ers, briefs were filed with the Board for their reference and guid- 
ance when the location was to be definitely determined. : 
After having visited all the places and studying carefully the 
advantages and disadvantages of each place, the Board in regular 
session, December 2, 1909, by a majority vote, decided on the 
following places: For East Tennessee, Johnson City; for Middle 
Tennessee, Murfreesboro; for West Tennessee, Memphis. 
Johnson City appropriated $150,000 in bonds, free lights and 
water and other valuable considerations, such as ‘building a street 
railway to the school and providing granolithic sidewalks. Mr. 
George L. Carter donated to the Board a valuable site worth 
perhaps $60,000. 
Murfreesboro appropriated $180,000 in bonds, and a free site 
of 80 acres, worth $20,000 was provided for. 
Memphis appropriated $350,000 in bonds arid a free site of 
48 acres was provided for. 
Following the location of schools, the State Superintendent 
sent out circular of information for the use of architects who de- 
sired to submit competitive plans for any or all the buildings. 
Open competition was invited and twenty-one different plans 
wete submitted. The State Board of Education examined all 
of the different plans submitted by the competing architects, 
and after mature deliberation accepted the plan of Baumann 
Brothers, Knoxville, for the Hast Tennessee Normal School’
-P-A-G-E-68
o~ 50. 
.K. Colley, Nashville, for the Middle Tennessee Normal School; 
B.C. Alsup, of Memphis, and Adams & Alsup, Chattanooga, for 
the West Tennessee Normal School. | 
After the plans -were accepted and specifications prepared, 
matter advertising for bids was sent to all the leading construc- 
tion companies in this State and all companies with whom the 
Secretary of the Board could come in touch outside of the State. 
The Board at a-specified date received bids, and contracts 
“were awarded to the lowest bidder in each case. James Alexan- 
der was awarded the contract for the West Tennessee Normal 
School plant; Beaumont Company was awarded the contract for 
‘the East. Tennessee Normal; George Moore & Sons, Nashville, 
‘were awarded the contract for the Middle Tennessee Normal. 
Owing to the fact that the validity of the bond issue Act was 
attacked in the courts, and the constitutionality of the Act had 
to be tested, the bond issue was long delayed. However, to date 
all the bonds have been sold for the Middle and East Tennessee 
Nonmals, and Shelby County has sold a part of its bonds for the 
West Tennessee Normal, and it is hoped that early in the year 
1911 all the funds for the construction of the West Tennessee 
“Normal will be: available. 
Strate UNIVERSITY. 
The State University, standing as it does at the head of the 
Public School system,’ merits: the support of the entire people 
of the State in its efforts to expand and grow. Through its welt 
organized departments and its extension work it is touching 
every activity of the State.. A complete report of this institu 
tion is found elsewhere in this report. 
_ Scoot Lrprariss. 
‘The last Legislature passed an Act providing: 
. “That one per cent of the General Education Fund provided. 
by this Act shall be used to encourage and assist in the establish- 
ment and maintenance of libraries in the public schools as herein 
* -provided.. 
“Whenever the patrons and friends of any public school in 
. amy county of the State shall raise by private subscription or other- 
‘wise and tender to the County Trustee, through the County Super-"
-P-A-G-E-69
intendent of Public Instruction, the sum of twenty dollars ($20) 
or-more for the establishment and maintenance of a library for 
that school, said County Superintendent shall notify the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and, upon the certificate 
of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Comptrol+ 
ler of the Treasury shall pay to the Trustee of said county, out 
of the fund herein provided, a sum. equal ‘to half that raised by 
private subscription or otherwise, to be added to the library fund 
of said school; and whenevér ten dollars ($10) or mote shall be 
raised by private subscription or otherwise to supplement %& li- 
brary already established under the provisions of this section of 
this Act, said library may in like manner receive from the fund 
herein provided a sum equal to half the sum so raised. 
“Provided, that no school shall receive in any one year from 
this fund more than twenty dollars ($20) for the establishment 
of a new library, or more than ten dollars ($10) to assist in supple- 
menting a library already established. 
“Provided, further, that in distributing. the funds under the 
provisions of this section of this Act preference shall be given to 
applications coming from counties which have not previously 
received their proportionate part of this fund according to scho- 
lastic population. : 
“And, provided, further, that preference shall be given to 
applications for assistance to establish new libraries rather than 
applications to assist in supplementing libraries already estab- 
lished. 
“Tt shall be the duty of the State Board of Education to make 
and cause to be published through the office of the. State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction rules and regulations for libra- 
ties established under the provisions of this section of this Act, 
issue approved lists of books from which purchases for said libra- 
ties may be made with money received from the State as herein 
provided, and arrange for the purchase of such books at the low- 
est possible prices. All libraries receiving assistance from. this 
fund shall comply with all the regulations made by the State 
Board of Education, as herein provided. All money. received 
from the State to assist in establishing or supplementing a library- 
under the provisions of this section shall be used to purchase 
books on the approved lists aforesaid, and no books shall be pur- 
chased at a higher price than the price in said approved lists.
-P-A-G-E-70
— 52 — 
All purchases of books shall be reported to the County Superin- 
tendent, and a list of the same shall be attached to the warrant 
issued in payment of the same; and no commission shall be al- 
lowed the County Trustee on library funds. 
“One-fifth of the amount accruing. annually for school libra- 
ries under the provisions of this Act may be used for the purchase 
and maintenance of circulating libraries for the public schools of 
the State under the joint direction of the State Library and the 
Department of Public Instruction.” 
Under the provisions of this law about five hundred public 
school libraries have been established. More definite informa- 
tion as to the library work will be found elsewhere in this Report. 
To sun up briefly the progress that has been made, it might 
’ be stated: 
Ist. That the school system of the State has been unified 
and systematized, making one harmonious system. 
2d. The elementary schools have been graded. 
3d. State aid has been given to the establishment of High 
Schools, and the High Schools have been standardized and classi- 
fied by the State Board of Education under the direction of the 
High School Inspector. 
4th. Normal schools have been provided for, and nearly a 
million dollars donated to the State for the purpose of locating 
and equipping buildings. 
5th. State aid has been provided for the establishment of 
tural school libraries. 
6th. Provision has been made for more adequate salaries for 
County Superintendents, thereby insuring better supervision. 
7th. The State University has been recognized by law as a 
part of the public school system. 
8th. A change in method of school administration from the 
district to the county system whereby the old district. director 
system was abolished and the County Board system substituted. 
For all these improved conditions the school people of the 
State have worked as a, unit, and to each and all I tender my 
deepest thanks.

ever stood loyal by this department in all of its efforts for the im- 
provement of the schools of the State, avd to you no small share 
of credit is due for the rapid advancement made in educational 
growth during your administration.

SUMMARIES, 
The following summaries show the operations of all the pub- 
lic schools of the State for the years ending June 30, 1909 and 
June 30, 1910. 
-An-effort has been made to divorce the statistics of the coun- 
try schools from the statistics of the city schools with a view to 
noting the growth respectively in each system. 
In order that a report may be of value, the matter on which 
the statistics is gathered must be uniform so that the progress 
made. along any particular line can be meastired by a compari- 
son of what had formerly been done with what is being done at 
- the present. These tables have been compiled with tare and the 
accuracy of the whole is determined solely by the accuracy of 
the individual reports. 
There has been a very slight increase in the scholastic popu- 
lation within the last four years, and while the increase in enroll- 
ment and daily attendance has not been as rapid as friends of 
education would desire, yet from year to year there has been a 
substantial growth. Possibly the most gratifying thing in the 
teport is shown in the larger enrollment in the upper grades. 
‘This shows an increase in the efficiency of the schools; and from 
year to year as the school system is developed the number in at- 
tendance in the more advanced grades will steadily grow. This 
has been influenced, in my opinion, very largely by the estab- 
lishment of County High Schools, which have exerted a very 
wholesome effect on the elementary school below. 
Possibly the largest gain during the past two years has been 
in the material improvement. As school interest grows there is 
a stronger demand created for better school houses and better 
equipment; and during the past two years, in round numbers, 
there has been spent more than one million dollars for school 
buildings. This, however, has had the effect of shortening the 
scholastic terms, and the school term has not increased so rap- 
idly as the amount of funds would indicate that it should, but 
when we bear in mind that out of the school fund must be paid
-P-A-G-E-78
— 58 — 
not only teachers’ salaries. but the erection and equipment of 
school houses as well, it can be readily seen that a considerable 
portion of the fund is necessarily spent for material equipmient. 
There has been, however, a gradual increase in the scholas- 
tic term, and at the same time au increase in teachers’ salaries. 
The term is yet too short and the teachers’ salaries too smal to 
command the best talent. The children of the State need an’ 
eight months’ tern ‘taught by competent teachers, whose servi- 
ces could not be secured at a salary of $30 per month, and some. 
public school teachers receive even less. . 
The increase in the revenues of the State for the scholastic 
year ending June 30, 1910, over the preceding year is very 
largely due to the large bond issues of the cities and some of the 
Counties of the Staté for school purposes.

Sir: I herewith submit my first annual report of the Pub- 
lic High Schools of Tennesse, the same _being for the scholastic 
year ending June 30, 1910. 
Owing to the fact that this is the first general report attempted, 
it has been impossible to make every item complete, for some 
-principals and superintendents found their records had not been 
kept in accord with the forms used for this report. However, 
the items reported are not estimates, but facts taken from rec- 
ords. 
Most respectfully,.

State High School Inspector.

SYNOPSIS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL LAW. 
The County Courts are authorized (1) to levy a County High’ 
School tax not exceeding fifteen cents on the hundred dollars, 
or (2) to make-an appropriation out of the county funds: other’ 
than the. school funds, and (3) to elect a County High School 
Board of Education consisting of six members and the County 
Superintendent, not more than one member of the ‘board: to 
be elected from the same school district. 
The County High School Board of Education, after orga. 
ization, is required (1). to locate, establish and manage one or 
more High Schools, (2) to employ and make contracts with 
teachers holding a license to teach in the County High Schools,. 
(3) to draw all warrants on the County Trustee on account of © 
the High School fund, and (4) to keep a complete record of all 
business transacted. 
The State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State 
High School Inspector, and the County Superintendents have 
general supervision of the organization and management of all 
County High Schools. 
County Trustees are required to keep a separate and accurate 
account of all High School money collected by them and to pay 
it out only on the warrants of the County High School Board 
_ of their respective counties, 
The State Board of Education is given authority (1) to clas- 
sify all County High Schools, (2) to prescribe the minimum course 
of study, and (3) to make tegulations for the distribution of the 
State High School funds. 
For more than a quarter of a century. after the ‘enactment of 
a law providing for common ‘schools, the State did nothing for 
the higher education of the children living in the rural districts. 
Even in the wealthiest counties that levied a tax sufficient to 
run first-class elementary schools and able to maintain first- 
class high. schools, the people were not allowed the privilege of 
taxing themselves:for high schools. It was not thus in the cities. 
Under their charters, they could levy sufficient tax to erect 
puildings and to run first class elementary schools and first class 
high schools ten nionths in the year. That is, under the system 
referred to, the children of the cities were given a thorough ele- 
mentary and high schcol education, prepared for college entrance’
-P-A-G-E-283
— 257 — 
or for some useful vocation, while the childien of the rural com- 
munities. were denied all but a simple elementary education. 
‘If:the country children wanted to go to college they were forced 
to spend four years in a preparatory school, where they paid 
both board and tuition, before they could enter. If they wanted 
to prepare themselves for a vocation, they had to leave home and 
pay board and tuition. : 
It was not until 1889 that the State allowed any county to 
levy a high school tax for country children, and that law not 
only offered no help from the State but gave so little encourage- 
ment that but few counties took advantage of its provisions. 
The county court of Lake county was the first to levy a tax and 
start a high school. During the ten years following the passage 
of this law little progress was made. There was no uniformity 
in the course of study or management of schools, and in most 
places little work was done above the elementary course. 
With so great a difference in the educational advantages of 
the city over the country, it is not at all surprising that those 
who were ambitious for the success of their children were moving 
to the city to educate them, a thing that meant decay of the farm 
and of country institutions and the decline of country life.. 
These facts were so apparent that the legislaturé of 1909 
amended the high school law so that the opportunity of the 
country child might be the equal of that of the city child, and 
that every county might have one or more high schools that 
would meet the needs of All the people of every class. 
High schools are divided into three classes. ‘The counties 
having least taxable property may run a third class school or 
one whose course of study extends over two years, but the pupils 
who complete this course are not prepared for college. The 
second class school has a three-year course of study and those 
who complete it may enter the State University under certain 
conditions which the faithful student may remove. ‘The first 
class high school admits pupils who have completed an elemen- 
tary course equivalent to eight years of eight months. each, solid 
time, and gives them a thorough training in any one of the. four 
prescribed courses. Graduates of the first-class school are. ad- 
mitted to the regular courses in the State University free -of. all 
conditions. The first class school offers (1) an. academic course 
for the pupils who are to go to college, (2) a course in agricul-
-P-A-G-E-284
-— 258 — 
ture for farmer boys, (3) a course in home economics for the girls, 
(4) a commercial course for pupils desiring to take bookkeeping, 
stenography and typewriting. Some of the high schools are 
doing excellent work in all these courses, and one, Central High 
School of Hamiiton County, is doing, in addition to the foregoing, 
first class manual training, having a new brick building for its 
shops, and it well equipped for work in wood and iron. Fount- 
ain City High School of Knox County is also doing splendid work 
in all departments. A number of others are rimming courses in 
business, agriculture, home économics, and shorthand and type- 
writing. 
At the beginning of the year, thirty-six counties bad high 
schools; but the county courts of Carter, Hardin, and Overton 
did not make the levy for 1910, leaving thirty three. During the 
year, however, there were eleven counties, Claiborne, Greene, 
James, McNairy, Marion, Maury, Montgomery, Polk, Ruther- 
ford; Tipton and Williamson to levy the tax for the first time, 
and all except one are now running their schools. Hence, at the 
close of the year, forty-four counties are offering their children 
the advantages of a high school education. 
The general education law of 1910. provides (1) that the State 
shall pay to every county that levies the high school tax or makes 
an “appropriation out of the county funds for high schools one~ 
third as mich money as the county produces up to one-fiftieth 
of the total State high school fund; (2) that all high schools be 
graded and that the minimum course ‘of study be fixed; (3) that 
all teachers be licensed before they are eligible to teach in the 
high schools; and (4) that a high school inspector be employed - 
to supervise the work. 
(1) In December, 1909, the first distribution of the State 
high school fund was made, each county receiving one-third as 
much as it had produced up to the maximum, which was fifteen 
hundred dollars. 
(2) The State Superintendent, the Professor of Education 
in the University of Tennessee and the High School Inspector, 
after a conference with county and city superintendents, high 
school principals, and representatives of the leading colleges, 
carefully stiidied the conditions in every section and. prepared 
two courses of study for schools of the third class, three courses
-P-A-G-E-285
— 259 — 
for schools of the second class, and four courses for schools of the 
first class. These courses which appear elsewhere in this. report - 
are intended to meet the needs of the people whether they. live 
in the country or city, and are to be used in all schools run wholly 
or in part by the high school funds. : 
(3) When the general education law went into effect in July, 
1909, the ‘high school boards had already elected their teachers 
for the ensuing year, and it was too late to arrange for an exami- 
nation to test the qualification of teachers. But plans were then 
made to carry out this provision of the law, and in .June, 1910, 
three State examinations were conducted: one at Jackson for West 
Tennessee, one at Nashville for Middle Tennessee, and one at 
Knoxville for East Tennessee. ‘The questions were uniform and 
made by the High School Inspector, and the papers were graded 
under his directions. All persons passing this examination 
were given certificates to teach in any high school of any county 
in the State. On the same days these State examinations were 
held, and with the same questions, county examinations were 
held in each county in which one or more high schools were run. 
Ttiese examinations were conducted by committees composed of 
the County Superintendent and two other members selected by’ 
the county high school boards. ‘These committees graded the pa- 
pers and reported the same to the High School Inspector and 
certificates, good for the county in which the examination was 
held, were issued ror a term of two years. In addition to these 
certificates, under the direction of the State Board of Education 
high school certificates were issued to teachers holding a bache- 
“for’s diploma’ from a college requiring fourteen units for ad- 
mission and maintaining a four-year college course. The ‘latter, - 
however, is no permanent arrangement and may be modified or 
rescinded at any time. At this time all regularly elected high 
school teachers hold regular licenses. 
(4) The High School Inspector was charged with (a) the su- 
pervision of schools already established, (b) going before county 
courts in the interest of high school tax levies, (c) assist in the 
organization of new schools, (d) prepare questions and conduct 
examinations of applicants for high school certificates, (e) and 
such other related duties as may be assigned. 
Since the inspection of high schools requires so much time,
-P-A-G-E-286
  — 260 — 
the Inspector has not been able to keep up with the office duties 
as closely as should be done. The offices has been closed many 
days when it should be open and the Inspector has beet comt- 
pelled to give much time to clerical work when his time was 
needed more elsewhere. Hence, all the work could be done more 
promptly and more satisfactorily if the Inspector were allowed 
a clerk who could keep the office open every day as well as to 
keep up all clerical work. An arrangement of this kind would 
make the department much more efficient. 
On account of the different dates of closing high schools, it 
was impossible to arrange for uniform examinations for pupils 
completing the course. Hence, it was required that the prin- 
cipals prepare questions for their respective schools, conduct 
the examination under uniform requirements, grade the papers 
and report to the Inspector the names of graduates, and diplo- 
mas were then sent from the State Department. The follow- 
ing regulations were observed : 
Pupils completing all the branches of any course of study 
prescribed for the high schools of the first or second class, making 
a-general average of 80 in a written examination, not falling 
below 65 in any subject of the course taken, will be given a diplo- 
. ma showing that such work has been satisfactorily done. These 
diplomas will be signed by the principal, the secretary of. the 
local high school board, the State Superintendent, and the High 
School Inspector. 
Diplomas given pupils who complete the course in a first 
class high school will entitle the holders to enter the University 
of Tennessee in the regular Freshman.Class. Diplomas from ° 
pupils who have completed their course in a second class high 
school will admit them on condition for a limited time and if 
there is no first class high school in their county, to the Subfresh- 
man Class. 
After final examination, the principal will report for perma- 
nent record: the full name, address, and examination grades made 
by each graduate. Diplomas will be sent when ordered by the 
principal of the school or the county superintendent. 
By order of the State Board of Education, this the 30th day 
of March, 1910. , 
. The following courses of study were prepared and adopted 
for all high schools receiving county and State aid:

   NOTES ON COURSES OF STUDY AND 
GRADUATION. 
‘The English courses are intended for pupils who do. not ex- . 
pect to enter college at any time or those who expect: to take in 
college a course that does not require a foreign language.-.The 
Latin course should be taken by pupils who expect'to take a 
college course requiring foreign: languages. 
Bach pupil is expected to take the regular subje b 
exercises, and to have as many forty-minute recitations a- week 
as. are indicated by the number opposite each branch of: study, 
except Spelling which may not require forty minutes a day. 
It is not intended that a separate book on composition be 
studied, but that a written composition be required each Friday 
and that the composition and teachers’ criticism be such as to 
test the work in Grammar, Rhetoric or Literature studied during 
the week. 
The first year’s work in Latin should include the thotough 
study of a standard beginner’s book. In the second, year four 
books of Cesar; the third, six orations of Cicero; and the fourth, 
six books of Virgil, ‘The Grammar and Composition should be 
followed through the entire course as carefully as time. permits. 
If possible a special teacher should be employed to teach 
* Drawing, Vocal music and Writing, all of which have their credits, 
when properly taught. : 
‘As much as possible, Agriculture and Home Economics should 
be taught from the standpoint of practical life in the home and 
on the farm, standard texts are to be used. 
‘The work in Arithmetic intended is a thorough review of com- 
mon and decimal fractions and percentage, in all its applica- 
tions, based upon a standard High School text book. 
In the Foreign Language course no school is expected to 
teach more than one other foreign language besides Latin, which 
must be Greek, German, French or Spanish. This selection is 
made by the Principal and Board of Education and the pupil 
may not elect any other than the one thus adopted. 
The Commercial course includes all the standard branches. 
needed to prepare one for his commercial duties. No pupil should 
be. permitted to take bookkeeping, stenography or typewriting 
without taking the other branches of the course at the same time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
— 269 — 
All four-year courses are so planned as to make the required. 
number of units for college entrance, a unit being equivalent 
to the work of a year of not less than thirty-two weeks, five forty - 
minute periods a week, in each branch of study. 
Pupils completing the course of study for third class high 
schools ‘will be given a certificate, signed by the President and 
Secretary of the High School Board and the Principal of the 
School, showing that the required work has been done. 
Diplomas signed by the State Superintendent, the High School 
Inspector, the Chairman and Secretary of the High School Board 
and the Principal of the School, and containing an impression 
of the seal of the State will be given pupils who complete the 
course of study prescribed for High Schools of the first and sec- 
ond classes. 
No pupil should be allowed to graduate, or receive a diploma, 
who has not thoroughly mastered the course of study taken. 
Principals of High Schools are especially requested to see that 
every one who receives a diploma is fully entitled to it. A high 
standard of work must be maintained. 
All superintendents and principals should make their reports 
promptly, and all reports should be mathematically accurate.

In conclusion, I-beg to make the following recommendations: 
(1) That on and after the next change of members of county 
school boards, either by election or appointment, the county 
boards and county high school boards be one and the same 
board.
-P-A-G-E-297
— 271 — 
(2) That the high school law be amerided so that every county 
in the State will be required to levy a tax to establish and main- 
tain one or more high schools, so that all counties may have as 
nearly as possible an equal start that the State system may de- 
velop as a State system. 
(3) That the High School Inspector or some other official 
be given authority to examine school accounts of any county to 
see that the funds are expended as the law directs, and when 
not properly used to require the same done according to law. 
Most respectfully, 
Pp. L. HARNED, © 
High School Inspector.

MILAN STATE INSTITUTE, 
  
As conductor of the State Institute at Milan I desire. to make 
the following report: 
The town of Milan is well located and in every way an excel- 
lent place for holding a State Institute. The buildings and 
accommodations are commodious and comfortable. ‘The ar- 
rangements for examinations were especially good. The people 
of the town and especially the committees on arrangements 
were atteritive and careful, and did all in their power to make 
the institute a success. Prof. H, H. Ellis, superintendent of the 
Milan Public School, is one of the best hosts in Tennessee. Every 
member of the faculty and the institute as well, will long remem- 
ber his kindness and helpfulness. I have not known an institute 
better cared for. 
The institute was largely attended, our enrollment being 340. 
The personnel of the institute was hardly up to the standard, as 
- the records below will show; many of the members were too 
young to teach, and were not well prepared for the examination. 
Too many of the schools of Tennessee have been taught by boys 
and girls, who are not fitted for the work either by age or quali- 
fications. Two-thirds or three-fourths of the members of Ten- 
nessee State Institutes come from these small schools, taught by 
young and imcompetent teachers, who are not qualified them- 
selves and hence cannot prepare others for the work. This, in 
a large measure, accounts for the number of failures. It is there- 
fore well that the great State of Tennessee has decided to have 
its own Normal Schools, where its teachers may be better trained. 
The examinations prepared and furnished by the State De- 
partment of Public Instruction were eminently fair and sound 
in every particular. The papers handed in were graded with 
the greatest care and labor I’ve seen put on examination papers. 
Every answer on every paper was_carefully noted and. graded. 
The grades were as liberal as could be asked, and yet, notwith- 
standing this fairness and this liberality, practically only ten 
per cent of the primaries and twenty-five per cent of the seconda-
-P-A-G-E-346
— 320 — 
ties passed. The fault was not with the questions given for the 
examinations nor with the grading of the papers. 
: I desire to thank you for giving me as co-workers Supt. J. B. 
Cummings and Supt. C. W. Anderson. They were always ready 
and willing and labored dilligently for the good of the institute. 
Their work was of a high order and their wise counsel always 
helpful. 
The primary work by Miss Mattie Butler was good and while 
teachers do not take the interest in primary methods that they 
Should, I believe good was done. - 
‘The address by Supt. P. L. Harned, who represented the 
State Superintendent was timely, practical and helpful and was 
appreciated by the institute. 
T. B. Loccins, ; 
Conductor. 
The institute closed the course of lectures and examinations 
“on Thursday, July 1, 1909. 
After chapel exercises on Thursday morning, the following 
resolutions were unanimously adopted: 
RESOLUTIONS. 
We, the directors and teachers, members of the Milan Insti- 
“tute, desire to express our hearty appreciation of the kindness 
‘‘and hospitality that the people of Milan have extended to us 
‘during our stay with them. Their homes have been our homes 
in every sense of the word, and their sympathy and co-operation 
have been an inspiration to us. We feel that we are especially 
indebted to the Committee on Homes for this happy reception. 
We desire to extend especial thanks to Superintendent Ellis 
for his timely and unstinted assistance during the entire term of 
the Institute. We ‘have learned to know him as an invaluable 
coadjutor and incomparable host. 
We desire to thank the Rev. _R. L. Norris, of the Milan Bap- 
tist. Church, for his frequent presence and aid. 
We would thank Mr. John Denny of the Milan Banking Co., 
for valuable assistance in many ways. 
We heartily appreciate the many favors extended by the 
merchants and business men of the city, and shall ever remem- 
ber their many kindnesses.
-P-A-G-E-347
— 321 — 
We. would recommend Milan as suitable in every way for 
entertaining the State Institute, and in view of the eminently 
successful service rendered in the last two terms, we would 
heartily endorse a petition that the institute be placed here 
again next year. , ‘

WAVERLY STATE INSTITUTE. 
I herewith transmit my report of the State Institute held at 
Waverly from June 7th to July 2d, 1909, to your office. , 
The good citizens of Waverly had made all necessary arrange- 
‘ments to accommodate the institute. The Board of Education 
turned over to us their splendid school building in which to hold 
the sessions of the institute. We had a large assembly hall, 
seated with new desks, well lighted and supplied with electric 
fans. Se 
Supt. Tubb had his forces well organized, and he spared 
nothing to provide for the comfort and convenience of the insti- 
tute. He is an untiring worker and has a strong hold upon his 
teachers and people. He had every teacher in his county in at- 
tendance at the institute. This speaks well for the efficient 
management of the school affairs of Humphreys County. The 
faculty of the institute is deeply indebted to Supt. Tubb for the 
keen interest he took in the work, and for the valuable assistance 
rendered by him. , 
The instructors were faithful in the discharge of their duties. 
Miss Virginia P. Moore addressed the teachers in the interest of 
“the School Improvement Association. The teachers seemed to 
appreciate the work Miss Moore is doing along this line and a 
large number of them promised to take up the matter of im- 
proving their grounds and buildings. 
‘I desire to compliment you on the strong and forceful ad- 
dress you delivered before the institute. It aroused the teach- 
ers to a higher conception of their duties and responsibilities, 
opened up new avenues of thought, and inspired them to a greater 
endeavor to become strong, living teachers. Prof. J. H. Bayer,. 
of Huntingdon, also made a splendid address to our teachers. 
Prof. A. C. Webb, of Nashville, taught drawing two weeks for us. 
The teachers became deeply interested in his work. Miss Eliza- 
beth Oehmig’s work in primary methods was well received. She 
is an exceptionally strong teacher. She taught the teachers in 
her first lesson and held them until the close. I regard the pri- 
‘mary work as the vital part of the institute course.
-P-A-G-E-350
— 324 — 
We had a splendid body of teachers. They were sincere and 
’ earnest in their efforts to improve themselves. They’ cheer- 
fully complied with every regulation of the institute. 
We desire to acknowledge our appreciation of the courtesies 
extended to us by the good citizens of Waverly, and especially 
to the Board of Education and Supt. Tubb. 
Your examination schedule was carried out. The division 
of the work was as follows:

I herewith submit report of State Institute held at. Murfrees- 
boro, beginning June 7th and closing July 3d. The enrollment 
- was gratifying. The average daily attendance satisfactory and 
the interest on the part of the teachers very good. I wish to

shall not particularize on the work done, but each instructor is

displayed that same wise judgment that characterizes all your 
actions. 
Strong resolutions were passed by the teachers thanking 
Supt. Jones for again locating the State Institute at Murfreesboro, 
and commending the work of the faculty. Thanks were tendered 
all visitors and friends who contribute to the success of the work.

SPARTA STATE INSTITUTE. 
Please accept our sincere thanks for locating one of the State 
Institutes at Sparta, and for the honor you have conferred on 
me as conductor. 
Our enrollment reached 218, fifteen counties were represented, 
and much interest was manifested by all concerned. The people 
of the town were especially kind and hospitable, using much 
effort to make the stay of the teachers among them as pleasant 
as possible. The instructors were all able and efficient workers, 
who showed themselves to be experts in giving instruction in 
their special lines. I have never met, in ten years of Institute 
work a more successful teacher of primary methods than Mrs. 
Fannie Phillips. Miss Wheeler and Prof. Webb certainly made 
the subject of drawing very interesting. Profs. Sipple and Lau- 
rey handled their subjects with much ease and dexterity. Many 
excellent lectures were delivered by visiting teachers, such as 
Supts. Webber, L. S. Gillentine, W. B. Boyd, S. Houston Proffitt, 
yourself and others.

JONESBORO STATE INSTITUTE. 
I herewith submit the report of the first State Institute held 
at Jonesboro, June-July, 1909. 
This institute while comparatively small in point of numbers 
was one of the best ones with which I have ever been connected: 
This can be seen from a glance at the daily attendance, the large 
- “number of male teachers enrolled, and the large number of those 
who received certificates, when compared with the number of 
those who took the examinations. 
: The comparatively small number enrolled can be accounted 
for by the very bad state of the weather, the fact that adjoining 
“counties had arranged for their institutes before the place of the 
“State Institute was settled, and by the fact that no one was 
* enrolled who was not a bona fide teacher and was there for ‘the 
work. 
The citizens of the historic town of Jonesboro spared no pains 
to make the institute a success. Especial thanks are due the 
Board of Trade for their interest in everything which was for the 
best interests of the teachers. All were enthusiastic over the 
work and hope fora return of the State Institute next year. 
Supt. Estes of Washington County deserves great praise for his 
untiring efforts to keep things moving smoothly. 
~T believe that my colleagues furnished as strong a-corps of 
" instructors.as could be found in the State. Principals Darrah, 
of the County Central High School, Chattanooga, Fooschee,. of 
the Rhea County High School, Dayton, Clark, of Dibrell College, 
and: Mrs... M. Russell of Chattanooga are among the most: pro- 
gressive and enthusiastic teachers in the State. Their work is 
along the lines of true development and their labors were abund- 
antly rewarded in the interest and efforts of the teachers under 
. their charge. The work was divided as follows:

STATE INSTITUTES FOR 1910, 
FAYETTEVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
I herewith submit report of State Institute, held at Fayette- 
ville, from June 6 to July 2, 1910. . 
The attendance from the beginning was good and the interest 
on the part of the teachers was the greatest I have ever seen. 
It was noticeable from the beginning that they had come for 
business, and that spirit was manifest throughout the entire time 
I deem it unnecessary to particularize upon the work of each 
member of the faculty, suffice to say that the work done by each 
was entirely satisfactory to every one connected with the institute. 
However, since the introduction of the Library Work was some- 
thing entirely new to practically all the teachers, I fee) that I 
cannot afford to fail to make special mention of it. Mrs. 
Pearl Kelley endeared herself to all the teachers by her timely 
and helpful suggestions regarding the selection of books for a 
public school library and the further instruction of how to direct 
the reading of these books. We feel we are under special obli- 
gations to her for the efficient services given us. 
The scientific instruction given in agriculture by Prof. Lane 
was also a drawing card for the institute. Very.soon the farmers 
of the county began to take advantage of his lectures and his class 
grew from day to day until the close.

About 200 teachers took the examination; of that number 
something like 40 per cent received certificates. 
During the session we were favored with lectures from many 
of the leading educators of the State. At the close strong reso- 
lutions were passed endorsing the adininistration of Superin- 
tendent Jones, and especially thanking him for locating the insti- 
tute at Fayetteville. Thanks were also tendered the people of 
Fayctteville for the many favors shown the visiting teachers. 
The County Court met in its July term about the close of the 
- institute and made a further appropriation of $200 for the State 
institute for the year 1911. In addition to this, the teachers of 
Lincoln County, together with the County Board of Education, 
extended a strong invitation for the institute next year. 
The hearty co-operation of County Superintendent Reynolds 
added very materially in making the institute a success. _ He left 
nothing undone that was in his power to do in order, that every- 
thing might be pleasant. I can but feel that a great impetus 
has-been given to the cause of education here by the work done 
during the institute.

JONESBORO STATE INSTITUTE. 
Hon. R. L. Jones, Siate Superintendent of Public Instruction: 
Dear Srr—According to your regulations the State Institute 
opened at Jonesboro, Tenn., Monday, June 6, and continued until 
the morning of July 1. , 
The faculty was composed as follows: Conductor, W. E. 
Miller, United States History, Saulsbury’s Theory of Teaching, 
and Civics; Superintendent Oscar M. Duggar, of Greeneville, 
Tompkin’s "School Management, Geography, School Law, and 
Arithmetic; Superintendent R. H. Lankford, of Jonesboro, 
Rhetoric, Physics, and Geometry; Miss Nellie Cooper, of Park 
City, Primary Methods, and Dr. Schaeffer, of the University. of 
Tennessee, Biology and Nature Study and Physiology, his work 
continuing two weeks. In addition, Superintendent Estes, of 
Jonesboro, gave some lectures on Tennessee History; Mr. An- 
drews, of Nashville, some talks on writing, and Miss Ella Hayes 
some special instruction in Wheeler’s Primer. 
The institute was accorded a hearty welcome by the good 
people of Jonesboro, and both faculty and teachers were the re- 
cipients of many courtesies from them. 
The institute was favored with a visit from ‘State Superin- 
tendent Jones, Superintendent Gilbraith, and Superintendent Fra- 
zier, all of whom delivered inspiring and timely addresses which 
were enthusiastically received. 
As will be seen from the table below, the enrollment ‘was 
considerably ahead of that of last year. Superintendent Oscar 
Duggar, of Greene County, and his teachers are deserving of 
much commendation ‘for their excellent showing, both in attend- 
ance and interest manifested. 
Superintendent Oscar M. Duggar was selected Secretary of 
the faculty and Mr. Dean Chase and Miss Mary* Jenkins were 
elected respectively Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the 
institute. They both discharged their duties in an unusually 
efficient manner.
-P-A-G-E-364
— 338 — 
Mr. S. T. Wilcox and Misses Ethel Walker and Mary Smith 
were appointed a Committee on Resolutions, which were re- 
ported and adopted at the close of the institute. In their report 
athong other. items they recommended unqualified approval of

WAVERLY STATE INSTITUTE. 
  
‘I herewith transmit my report of the State Institute held at 
Waverly from June 6 to July 1, 1910. 
This session of the Waverly Institute was well attended. The 
spirit of the teachers was all that could be desired. They were 
very deeply interested in the work. 
This was the second institute held in this county and a marked 
‘ improvement was observed in the teaching force. The work of 
' the instructors was satisfactorily done. They most -cordially 
complied with every demand of the Conductor. 
We had only one session each day. However, the instructors 
Spent a good portion of every afternoon in doing some special 
work for the teachers. It was a busy time around the institute 
from tarly morning till late in the afternoon. 
The citizens took special interest in entertaining the teachers 
and making their stay pleasant. All pronounced Waverly a good 
institute town. Much is due Superintendent Tubbs for his untir- 
ing efforts to make the session a great success. All regret to 
learn that he will not stand for re-election. He has done a splen- 
did work in Humphreys County. 
The work done in agriculture and in primary methods de- 
- serves special mention. The teachers received great inspiration 
from each of these instructors. 
The very able address of Hon. R. L. Jones was specially in- 
spiring and instructive. 
The examination schedules were strictly carried out.

SPARTA STATE INSTITUTE. 
Yesterday we closed at Sparta the second State Institute held 
at this place. The attendance this year was larger than last year 
and much more interest manifested on the part of the teachers. 
In fact in my ten years of State Institute work I have never seen 
a better institute than we had this year. 
The citizens of Sparta and the people of White and surround- 
ing counties seemed to be deeply interested and attefded our 
public meetings in large numbers and gave us every encourage- 
ment they possibly could. The good citizens of Sparta generously 
threw open their doors and entertained the teachers in a most - 
hospitable manner. I am sure they have not forgotten that this 
is Superintendent Jones’ native county, and they show that they 
appreciate the great and noble work which he is accomplishing. 
We had the following faculty of well qualified, industrious, 
working teachers: N. N. Billingsley, Conductor; Prof. J. B. 
Clark of Dibrell Normal; Prof. G. C. Sipple of White County 
High School; W. M. Brown, Instructor in Agriculture; Miss 
Priscilla Polk, Primary Instructor; Miss Pearl Williams Kelley, 
Library Instructor, and Prof. A. C. Webb, Penmanship and 
Drawing. 
The following distinguished gentlemen visited the institute 
and delivered most excellent lectures: Superintendent R. L. 
Jones, President Sidney D. Gilbeath of the East Tennessee State 
Normal, Fred B. Frazier, Inspector of Elementary Schools, and 
others. 
Our tabulated report will show more accurately the result 
of the work done. But I must say that I never saw a body of 
teachers or a faculty seemingly more interested or doing better 
work. 
I take this opportunity to express to Superintendent Jones 
our most sincere and heartfelt thanks for having given us two 
State Institutes at Sparta.
-P-A-G-E-370

I am sure that the cause of education in this entire section 
has been greatly benefited by the work of the State Institute.

DYERSBURG STATE INSTITUTE. 
  
The teachers in attendance showed great interest, the in- 
structors whom you sent to assist me were able and efficient and 
ever ready to co-operate with me in all things that pertained 
to the success of the institute, and the citizens of Dyersburg 
seemed to appreciate our work and presence among them and 
extended to us many tokens of hospitality. 
If I were not the conductor, I should say that we have had 
one of the most successful institutes ever held in the State, and 
should you decide to have State institutes again next year, I 
believe Dyersburg should be chosen for one of the places.

PARIS STATE iNSTITUTE. 
Str—As conductor of the 1910 State Institute, held at Paris. 
I desire to'make the following report. 
The location of the institute was superb. Paris, with its 
splendid school facilities, is well equipped with everything rieeded 
for the work of State institutes. The arrangements for the daily 
sessions of the institute were complete in every detail and the 
accommodations for examinations were unsurpassed. The people 
of the town, under the splendid leadership of Supt. Sherrill and 
Prof, Wright, were alert to every interest of the institute, and 
did all in their power for the success of the work and also for 
the comfort, convenience and pleasure of the visiting teachers. 
The teachers were well provided for and well cared for in the 
very best homes of the city. Professors Sherill and Wright had 
planned so wisely and carried out their plans so skillfully and 
had such united co-operation from their people, that the man- 
agement of the institute was-a pleasure and our stay in Paris 
will long be remembered by every member of the institute. 
The personnel of the institute was quite an improvement over 
that of last year. The teachers were more mature and seemed 
more in earnest. It was a splendid body of working teachers, 
eager to learn and to improve themselves, that they might. do 
better service for the public. While quite a large per cent failed 
on éxaminations, the institute was better in this respect also 
than a year ago. 
I wish to commend most highly my co- -workers, Messrs. 
Sherrill, Wright and Bright. They were true, loyal and efficient. 
The management of, an institute with such assistants is an easy 
matter. Miss Arthur did most excellent work as instructor in 
primary methods. She held the institute as I’ve seen no one else 
do with this work, and I’m sure good was done. 
Supt. Joe Routon was with us frequently and added much to 
the institute,
-P-A-G-E-375
— 349 — 
The teachers very much enjoyed the splendid address of our 
always welcome and popular State Superintendent. 
At the last session of the institute the following resolutions , 
were passed by unanimous vote of the teachers: : 
“WeEreas, We, the teachers attending the State Institute 
at Paris, from June 6 to July 1, 1910, have been so hospitably 
entertained during our stay in Paris, we desire to return our 
sincere thanks to the good people of the town for their many 
favors and their excellent care. We also wish to thank Pro- 
fessors Sherrill and Wright for their forethought and for the 
splendid manner in which they planned for the accommodation 
and entertainment of the institute. 
“We Turther desire to thank the Paris Post-Intelligencer for 
its favors in distributing to us each week, free of cost, copies 
of the paper.”

SELMER STATE INSTITUTE, 
I hereby submit my annual report as Conductor of the State 
Institute held at Selmer, June 6 to July 1, 1910. There was a 
manifest improvement in the spirit and personnel of the student 
body over the preceding year. 
The goéod people of Selmer gave us their hearty co-operation 
and sympathy, opening their homes to the teachers, thus giving 
a home-like touch to the life of the institute. 
I have never seen a body of teachers do better work or take” 
more interest in the instruction given. A new spirit came over 
the School Board of Selmer between July,1909, and June, 1910. 
Conditions. and environments were entirely changed and that 
for the better. : 
The faculty—-C. P. Jester, C. B. Ijams, Miss Mary Herron, 
and W. J. Forbes, representing the University of Tennessee, in 
Agriculture—did splendid work that will be felt in the develop- 
ment of the rural schools for years to come. 
I must not fail to mention the work of Horry Hodges in the 
subject of English History. He was a star every day and shone 
brighter day by day. 
Terry Abernathy, County Superintendent, gave valuable 
assistance, and his special work in penmanship was highly enjoyed 
by the teaching body: 
On the whole I beg to say, sir, that the institute was a great 
success and I give my splendid faculty the credit.

STATE INSTITUTE FOR COLORED TEACHERS, 1909. 
KNOXVILLE STATE INSTITUTE, 
  
The institute for colored teachers held in Knoxville was in 
every respect a success. The faculty appointed by you did 
splendid work. 
ATTENDANCE. 
The public took kindly to our faculty and teachers. Fathers, 
mothers and children of high school were with us from day to 
day throughout the session. At no time has the community 
been so thoroughly alive to the importance of education as was 
manifested at this institute. 
THE Work. 
Realizing that there would be but few pupils taking the 
high school course, both County and City Superintendents urged 
the faculty to concentrate attention on primary work. Possi- 
bly this course assisted materially in increasing attendance. 
New ideas, new plans, new methods, helpful devices were brought 
to bear at various stages of development. In this manner sen- 
timent was crystalized and best results secured. 
SUPERVISORS. 
In your absence we gladly availed ourselves of the helpful 
advice of Prof. E. R. Cate, Superintendnet of Knox County 
schools, and Prof. S. A. Mynders, Superintendent of city schools, 
Knoxville. Although called upon often they were never too 
busy to grant us a respectful hearing and adjudicate our claims. 
THE PRESS. 
Mr. Fritz Cansler, as reporter for the Journal and Tribune, 
very ably presented the important features of the institute. 
This is a very important feature of institute work and deserves 
more than passing mention. Jas. G. Beck gathered information 
for the Knoxville Sentinel and Knoxville Review.
-P-A-G-E-384

ADDRESSES. 
We were honored with addresses from Prof. 5. A. Mynders, 
Mr. W. G. S. McCampbell, Prof. J. R. Lowry, Dr. E. Routvahn 
and Prof. E. R. Cate. These addresses were instructive and 
inspiring, embodying ideas that were eminently practical and 
_ suited for-the work. 
SCHOLARSHIP. 
: .The proximity of Knoxville College, the excellent system of 
public schools of Knoxville, the influence of Maryville and Mor- 
tistown as well as Swift Memorial College have raised the scholastic 
attainments of the average individual beyond the ordinary. 
Hence Krioxville, Knox County and adjoining counties have 
many well qualified teachers.

ConcLusion.. 
It is but fitting that I should refer to the kindly consideration 
that you have manifested in our welfare. Mere words and empty 
phrases would but betray human weakness, and add little to the 
heartfelt gratitude manifested by myself and faculty. 
Rest assured, sir, that -if we have failed to give entire satis- 
faction in the discharge of our duties, the error is not due to a 
Jack of zeal. . °

NASHVILLE STATE INSTITUTE, 
I have the honor to submit to you herewith my report of the 
State Institute just closed. I feel that I cannot commend too 
highly the earnest work of the teachers. A new spirit seemed to 
actuate them and they went at their work with a will. This 
interest continued throughout the meeting and there were many 
regrets when the institute closed. I am anticipating a great 
improvement in the teaching ability of those who were present. 
Just here, I would like to say a word in commendation of Hewett’s 
Pedagogy. This is a splendid little book and should be in the 
hands of every teacher in the State. I think the thoughts and 
instruction contained in this book are responsible in a large 
measure for the great and active interest manifested by the teach- 
ers. It gave them a better conception of their duties and re- 
sponsibility. . 
The instruction given by the different members of the faculty 
was not only up to the standard, but a little better than any 
previously given. This shows progress and is just what ought 
to be expected in a wide-awake, progressive body of teachers. 
The addition of Dr. J. P. Crawford to our faculty was a decided 
advantage. We needed more help, as the work had become too 
heavy for three teachers, and I wish to thank you for giving 
us such a conipetent assistant. It was the aim of the faculty 
to make the institute effective, both in reviewing the subjects 
that were taught and in giving the best methods by which sub- 
jects were to be presented. The institute was visited by many 
prominent citizens, ministers, lawyers and doctors, all of whom 
gave their hearty endorsement to the work that they saw. “At 
the close of the institute suitable resolutions were read.and adopted 
endorsing the faculty. Thanking you for the institute, and ex- 
pressing gratitude to the Board of Education for the use of the 
public school building. A vote of thanks was also extended 
Prof. W. C. Anderson for the support and personal interest in the 
work and success of the institute.

STATE INSTITUTES FOR COLORED TEACHERS, 1910: 
‘LANE COLLEGE STATE INSTITUTE. 
Sir—I beg to submit herewith my report of the work of the 
State Institute for Colored Teachers, held at Lane Gollege, 
Jackson, Tenn., June 13 to July 8, igro. woe 
For the past few years this institute work has been carried 
on in conjunction with the Lane College Summer School. Al- 
.though the attendance this year was smaller than that of last 
year, the work was conducted with as much interest and enthu- 
siasm. The total enrollment was 121. All of these were in 
attendance upon the recitations and lectures. from time to time. 
In behalf of the institute work, the following schedule was 
carried out:

It has been our ambition to make the Institute and Summer 
School a “model” one, serving as an object lesson in all. that 
pertains to school management. I am much pleased to be able 
to report progress each year in this respect. 
All of the members of the faculty are of college rank, and in 
addition to their general training, they have had years of expe- 
rience in the school room as teachers, They did very efficient 
service, and I am satisfied their instruction was a source of inspi- 
The. Reading Circle Course of Study as adopted by the State 
Board of Education is of great pedagogical value. The teachers 
are beginning to have clearer notions of the real work of the 
school room, and the true meaning of education. They appre-- 
ciate fully the interest which the State. School Commissioner 
has taken in the educational welfare of the people of Tennessee, 
and renew their pledge to give him their unreserved support in 
carrying out the measures inaugurated by him to reach all.of 
the people. Appropriate resolutions were passed to that effect.

REPORTS OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
In accordance with your request for a written report on the 
progress of Anderson County schools, I am sending you the fol- 
lowing: ~ 
Just after the Legislature incorporated the library. provision 
in the general Education Bill and passed the same, we inaugu- 
rated a library crusade in Anderson County, which is still going 
on, and which met with unparalleled success throughout East 
Tennessee. $1,053 worth of library. books have been added to 
the cotinty schools, through State aid, up to the present writing. 
In addition to this, six traveling libraries have been furnished 
us by the State library; so that approximately half of our schools 
have been furnished with excellent libraries since the Legislature 
enacted this law. Pupils and patrons are reading them with - 
enthusiasm, and they are now one of the most important educa- 
tional factors in our county. 
With the library plan well on foot, we took up the idea of school 
improvement associations, and they are now spreading with 
success in the rural schools of the county, and some valuable 
improvements are being made on many of the school buildings 
and grounds. The county organization has a library of 549. 
volumes, and the money is now on hand to make a valuable 
addition. A large number of local organizations have been made, 
and. the idea is spreading at a healthy rate. We don’t expect 
all these reforms to mature suddenly, and an occasional failure 
does not cause us to give up the struggle. We. realize that the 
battle against ignorance isa real “‘battle,” and that illiteracy does 
not surrender without a fight. It is only a question of time 
until all our schools are organized. 
About five one-room school buildings, with modern apparatus 
to furnish same, have been erected during the last eighteen 
months, but-I am not in sympathy with the one-room idea. 
Hence, I am not very proud of this part of the report. In.every
-P-A-G-E-398
\ 
— 372 — 
case I urged the Board and people to consolidate, but they do 
not take to this idea as well as some others that I have urged. 
I believe that every county in Tennessee has as many school 
buildings of the kind as it. needs, and a deplorably few consoli- 
dated ones. I attribute this lack of sympathy with the consoli- 
dated schools to ideas that have been inherited from an older 
generation, and to a false love of the patron for his child, which 
causes him to fear that his child will have a little distance to walk, 
forgetting the advantages, both mentally and physically, gained 
in the same. . 
As to county high schools, we have one of the best central 
schools, judged from the standpoint of thoroughness, that is 
found in the State. Our only drawback is lack of funds. When 
our court comes to a deeper appreciation of the function of the 
high school, I am sure that this perplexing problem will be solved. 
When I came into office, the school was endeavoring to exist on the 
pitiful sum of $900 a year. Of course, the results were disappointing. 
The court then increased the appropriation to $2,000, including 
$500 State aid. This enabled us to secure a Principal at $900 
and give other places in the county high school advantages. Last 
January, the court further extended its aid by a 5 cént tax, 
which, including State aid, will yield us about $2,400. This is 
certainly an improvement, but I haven’t got near what I want 
yet. I want the City of Clinton to donate its school property 
to the county for a central high school. Then I want the court 
to appropriate $5,000 per annum to equip and maintain it. I 
want it equipped with apparatus for teaching manual training, - 
domestic science, drawing, home economics, bookkeeping, stenog- 
raphy, agriculture, etc., a real high school in action as well as 
in name. We used about $1,800, or will use this amount to pay 
for instruction in the central school this year, and the remainder 
towards extending high school privileges to other parts of the 
county. In. consideration of the extra outlay used to improve 
the central school, the City Board of Education have agreed to 
erect and give us permanent use of a dormitory, the estimated 
cost of which is $2,500. This is to be ready for occupancy. by 
the first.of the year. When our people appreciate the real func- 
tion and value of the high school, the above conditions will be 
secured. I would have them now, if I could; but I am a repre- 
sentative and not a dictator, and must patiently labor and hope
-P-A-G-E-399
— 873 — 
for the time when these demands will be made by the people. 
In the meantime, I cannot but comply with their wishes and en- 
deavor to bring them into an appreciation of the ideas here set 
forth. , 
At present our tax for the support of the e'ementary schools, 
including the State tax of fifteen cents, is forty cents on the 
hundred dollars. This is not sufficient, and I believe the full 
amount allowed by law ought to be levied. The poll tax, in- 
cluding the State levy, is $2.00. Some provision ought to be 
made for erecting and repairing school buildings without having 
to depend on the elementary school fund for it. We ought to 
have an elementary school fund sufficient to run the elementary 
schools. nine months in the year. In order to secure greater 
efficiency in the school instructing force, while the rural schoo's 
are only five or six months in length, I believe it is a good idea 
for one- teacher to teach two schools. This will secure him con- 
stant employment, so that his heart and time can be devoted 
to the work. . 
We had a compulsory school law enacted, but we found it 
defective in many particulars; so that an attempt to enforce 
it, while materially increasing the attendance, did not meet with 
the approval expected. ‘The trial has made us doubtful about 
the wisdom of forcing ideas on people, for which they are unpre- 
pared. Public sympathy does not yet favor the enactment of 
such a law; and with the masses antagonistic to it, its enforce- 
ment is very difficult, if not impossible. 
On the whole, however, the public is becoming more en- 
lightened and more in sympathy with progressive ideas. With 
continual agitation of educational uplift, these ideas will gradually 
be absorbed by the public mind. With such a change in the at- 
titude of the public mind, educat’onal reforms will be demanded, 
and persuasion will be a thing of the past. ©

BEDFORD COUNTY. ~ 
Complying with your request for a general report of the 
public school interests of Bedford County, I beg leave to submit 
the following: 
Libraries—Bedford County has a good teachers’ library with 
five or six hundred volumes of good books, which are fairly welt 
read by our teachers. This library is to be supplemented very 
soon by the addition of a goodly number of first class books. 
The county has three Public School Libraries with good 
substantial cases and a good selection of books. We hope to 
have several others established soon. There are a number of 
private school libraries in the county. 
While considerable attention has been given to school improve- 
ment, and many school rooms are showing the results in their ap- 
pearance, no school improvement associations have been organized. 
Three thousand dollars have been spent this year for new 
houses, improvements on old ones, apparatus, etc. More must 
be spent before all our houses are comfortable. 
In some sections of the county there is an imperative need 
of consolidation in order to make the schools more interesting 
and efficient. Better roads would add immensely to the welfare 
of our county schools. 
No county high schools have been provided for. Bedford 
County has good city public schools and training schools at 
Shelbyville, Bell Buckle and Wartrace, with high grade secondary 
schools at Normandy, Unionville, Flat Creek, Hilltop, and other: 
points. This supply of advanced schools seems to militate: 
against the establishing of county high schools rather than in: ° 
favor of it. : 
Our school tax, State and county, is 40 cents on the hundred 
dollars. No special tax has been levied for school purposes.
-P-A-G-E-402
— 376 — 
, ‘There has been an improvement in the daily attendance of 
many of our schools, but this improvement does not appear in 
others, and is not sufficiently marked in those where it exists. 
Sentiment for a mild compulsory law is growing in the county, 
and teachers who are certainly the best judges, are outspoken 
in their demands for relief from this annoying irregularity in 
attendance. . 
The County Board of Education has declared by resolution 
that the teachers’ salary shall depend, in part, upon the general 
interest manifested in the cause of education as shown by at- 
tendance upon annual institutes, monthly teachers’ meetings, 
etc., a record of which is required of the superintendent. This 
has a salutory influence in securing the attendance of lukewarm 
teachers.

One $60 school library has been establishe~ this year, receiving 
$20 from the State Library Fund. In‘ ~'. has been aroused 
in the work which promises fair to result in s-veral more libraries 
soon. 
ScHooL IMPROVEMENT. 
A strong county organization has beén effected. Miss Moore 
started the work June 14th and alr ‘ every teacher in the
-P-A-G-E-404
> — 378 — 
county is now an active member of the County Association. 
Local associations have been organized in a number of communi- 
ties and have resulted in an increased school interest in every 
case. One splendid rural school house has been built, painted, 
and equipped mainly through the efforts of a local S. I. A., and 
the library mentioned above was secured through the same 
agency. The Camden local association is planning a campaign 
for a new brick school building in the near future. Grounds. 
have been improved, buildings repaired, pictures hung and sani- 
tary conditions generally improved throughout the county by 
. the efforts of the associations. 
MATERIAL, EQUIPMENT, HOUSES, ETc. 
Three new houses were built the past year and one is now 
in process of erection. The County Board of Education pur- 
chased desks for each house in the county last year. 
Some few globes, charts, and blackboards have been added. 
Efforts are being made to consolidate schools where possible and 
build good housés. The school patrons are asked to assist in 
the erection of houses so as to take less public money and give 
a longer school term. They have responded liberally in almost 
every case, . 
. County HicH ScHOOLS. 
' There is a growing sentiment in favor of a County High 
School, though as yet nothing definite has been accomplished. 
Loca TAXasTIon. 
The county tax rate now is twenty-five cents on the hundred 
dollars, property, and one dollar poll. This on. the assessed 
valuation does ndt-yield sufficient revenue for an adequate term. 
ATTENDANCE. 
This is our greatest problem in the rural schools. Much 
has been done through the School Improvement Association and 
through the individual efforts of the teachers to better conditions 
along this line. It has been a topic in every teachers’ meeting 
this year and plans are discussed relative to the subject in order. 
to help the teacher with the problem. A compulsory law would 
possibly be the key tothe situation. 
There is a growing demand in the county for better trained
-P-A-G-E-405

teachers, comfortable school houses, and adequate equipment 
and grounds which will surely result in better conditions in the 
rural schools of the future.

As per your appointment I went to East Tennessee to assist 
Superintendent C. O. Chisam in holding his institute. I arrived ~ 
at Pikeville on Monday evening. 
Superintendent Chisam had, during the day, met with his 
teachers and made out the program—putting me on the Read- 
ing Circle work, Grammar, Physiology, U. S. History and Geol- 
ogy of Tennessee. I found the teachers very well up on the 
Reading Circle but grossly ignorant of grammar and history. I 
had an uphill pull with those subjects the whole time. 
Superintendent Chisam gave instructions in mathematics and 
_physics. They seem to be better up on this line’of work than 
they were on language. 
There were thirty-eight teachers who took the examination, 
quite a number of them failing to make the required average. 
‘But the Superintendent assured me that he would have to 
use every one of them and others too, if he could get them The 
institute closed July 1. Superintendent Chisam kept the roll and 
record and will report in detail. 
Yours respectfully, 
W. E. SHocKkLey.

The school work of our county is getting better from year to 
year.. The school sentiment is growing stronger and the people 
are demanding better qualified teachers, better and more con- 
venient houses, better equipment and all that tends towards 
bringing good school results.
-P-A-G-E-407

We have no School Improvement Association, but the school 
grounds are being cleaned and cared for in a way that deserves’ 
mention. The houses also are well cared for on the inside, being 
made attractive and homelike with pictures, flowers and other 
decorations. The sanitary conditions are also better looked 
after by those in charge. There is yet much to do to make the 
country school houses what they should be for the comfort and 
welfare of the children. 
During the last year six new school houses have been built. 
These are all good houses and well equipped for work. Many of 
out houses are not yet supplied with good desks, but this is being 
done as rapidly as we can manage to get to it. We hope to soon 
have our county well supplied with good houses, well equipped 
for work. mc , 
We have not succeeded in getting a high school tax levy. 
It is badly needed and, therefore, we will try, try, again. 
The court has been very liberal in its tax levy for school 
purposes in this county. The court is in sympathy with the 
elementary school and is ever ready to help. 
We have a compulsory school Jaw in the county, and while 
it has not proved altogether satisfactory, it has brought good 
results. 
Many children were the last year in school, from twelve to 
sixteen years of age, who had never attended school. The attend- 
ance in many of our schools during the busy months on the farm 
was more than doubled by the compulsory law. 
The majority of our people are in sympathy with the law and 
are standing by it, while some, in defiance of the law, refuse 
to send to school. “The provisions of the law are not just what 
they should be for a rural community like ours. With some 
changes in the law, to a great extent, the attendance problem 
will be solved. :

BRADLEY COUNTY. 
_ While our schools in some respects have not made the progress 
I had hoped for at the beginning of the year, in others they have 
surpassed my greatest expectations. 
Our teachers have become interested in the library movement 
so that it is hoped by the end of this year there will be libraries 
in every school in the county. At present we have libraries in 
about one-half of the schools. : . 
There have been no School Improvement Clubs organized as 
yet. This is due to my being physically unable to put the energy 
in the movement to arouse the necessary interest. . 
Our greatest progress has been in the way of new buildings 
and equipments. For the first time we have begun the building 
of real school houses and have quit the building of boxes as of 
old, and we are putting in real school desks. While we put up 
but one of the new model school houses, built according to the 
State plan book, it has caused a complete revolution of the mode 
of school buildings in this county. The County Board of Educa- 
tion is planning to put up several more good buildings in the near 
future. During the past year there has been a great deal done in 
remodeling and adding to old buildings. Until this year we had 
not begun the use of single desks, which I think is one of our 
greatest improvements. We put in something over three hun- 
dred of these. 
Our greatest drawback is the lack of qualified teachers: It 
seems impossible to get enough teachers to take up our schools, 
so we have to do the best we can. Almost one-third of our teach- 
‘ers this year are first year teachers taken from the young boys 
- and girls of the county. About one-half of these always make 
failures and have to quit before the term is out or drag along with- 
out any school, and a large part of the others marry or leave 
the county, so we have the same thing to go over again at our 
next election of teachers.

CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
I wish to say in connection with my annual report that we 
have secured State aid for four school libraries, and before the 
present term is out we will secure about thirty more libraries. 
Our greatest difficulty seems to be in getting the patrons to take 
the proper interest. 
We organized a School Improvement Association last year 
but ‘nothing material was accomplished, but for the present 
year we are making our work count for something. Through 
the courtesy of the faculty of Lincoln Memorial University, I . 
was able to offer a free scholarship in that institution to the 
teacher accomplishing the most in the way of improvements. 
A number of teachers are striving to obtain this scholarship. 
During the past two years about $100.00 have been spent 
for new buildings arid equipments, giving comfortable surround- 
ings for nearly every school in the county. 
We have five high schools in Campbell County, two second 
class and three third class schools. Last year we spent more than 
$7,000 for high school purposes and enrolled 355 students. 
The local school tax is 35 cents, of which 10 cents is for high 
school purposes. This tax with the 15 cents levied by the State 
yields about $30,000 advalorem tax. From all sources we re- 
ceive about $50,000 school funds. 
The attendance for last year was better than for any preceding 
year. More interest was taken and better work done than ever 
before. 
The maximum salary paid for teachers last year was $60.00, 
and the minimum salary $40.00. While this is a considerable 
raise in the salaries, still we are compelled to pay it in order to | 
hold our best teachers. 
My strongest efforts have been centered on grading and sys- 
tematizing the schools of the county, and I feel gratified to know 
that with the very excellent course of study prepared by Superin- 
tendent Jones I have succeeded.

CARROLL COUNTY. oo 
Following are a few of the school conditions of my county: 
During the past year nine libraries were installed at’an ag- 
. gregate cost of $331.57, containing about eight hundred volumes, 
with prospects encouraging for others during this year..: Since 
less than two years ago, the teachers have installed a Jibrary 
of about 300 volumes in the .Superintendent’s office for .their 
special tse; paid one-half on a new Oliver Typewriter No. 5, and 
also put in the Superintendent’s office globes, maps, ete., for’ their 
reference and use. 
There have been a few School Improvement Associations 
organized in the county with very satisfactory results. 
We have built several new houses and placed in them and 
others of the old ones a number of ne w desks and other equipment, 
We have systematized and so improved the work of the-pri- 
mary and secondary schools that we find ourselves seriously 
in need of the County High School, but we do not have it and no 
immediate prospect of getting it. : 
- Our county tax for public schools is not sufficient to maintain 
our schools in the rural districts as long as they should run. We 
get only 40 cents from both State and county. 
As a result of greater harmony of action between the County 
Superintendent and the teachers of the county, through the 
County Teachers’ Association, we have been able to raise the 
daily attendance 5 per cent, and the number who can read and 
write 9 per cent. 
By means of a weekly report (copy of which I enclose for your 
inspection), which the teachers fill out, a greater amount of sani- 
tary work has been accomplished during the two summer months 
of school than has been accomplished during any two previous 
years.

CARTER COUNTY. 
During the past two years Carter County has made some 
progress along educational lines. The public sentiment for 
having better school houses, better equipment and better schools, 
is growing slowly but steadily. Several new houses have been 
built and quite a number of houses have been supplied with good 
desks. We need several new school houses, and sorry to say, 
only about one-half of the schools in the county are supplied 
with desks, but we hope in a few years to have a good, well equip- 
ped school house for every school in the county. 
Last year six public school libraries were established in the 
county. This will be a nucleus to establish more the coming 
year. . 
During our County Institute in June last, the teachers of the 
county established a library for teachers, and also organized a 
County School Improvement Association. 
Carter County has a compulsory attendance school law which 
increased both the enrollment and the attendance of the schools. 
In the year 1908-09 the enrollment was 5,095, the average daily 
attendance 2,602, while in the year 1909-10 the enrollment was 
5,487, the average daily attendance 3,802. 
The school officers enforced the law, and it has brought good 
results. We certainly hope that this law will be a permanent one. 
The County Board of Education has established a system for 
‘the gradation of teachers’ salaries, which we hope will help to 
keep the good teachers in the work and help to eliminate those 
who do not intend to make teaching a profession. 
Some of our teachers are not very well trained in the modern 
methods of teaching, but they are making some improvement 
each year. 
In the year 1909-10 we had more teachers who were college 
graduates than ever before. The Reading Citcle Course has 
caused a considerable awakening among the teachers, arousing 
them to the importance of proper training, and causing research 
for knowledge in a broader sense.

It was the impression of many of the older teachers of. the 
county that this institute was the best ever held in Carter County. 
‘The teachers showed interest from the first day; they took 
part in the discussions and seemed to appreciate any information 
given them. Before the institute closed, many teachers said 
they had been benefited a great deal. 
We owe the success of the institute largely to our excellent 
_ conductor, Prof. Geo. C. Simmuns.

County Superintendent. 
CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
During the past two years the people and teachers of this 
county have become accustomed to the new system of having 
the schools administered by a Board’ of Education instead of 
Boards of District Directors. Since the new order of things 
has become understood general satisfaction has prevailed. 
"It has been necessary to enlarge a number of our buildings, 
and in many places where formerly one teacher was used, we 
now have two. The school equipment has been improved in 
every district in the county by supplying blackboards, desks 
and other needed furniture. A number of new buildings upon 
the most approved plans have been erected in the county. In 
many instances the people of the vicinity of the school contri- 
buted substantially to the cost of the new house. In most of 
the cases the patrons of the school furnished the rough lumber 
and did the work, leaving only the finishing material to be sup- 
plied by the Board of Education. 
Our teachers and patrons are becoming interested in the matter 
of school libraries. Several orders have been placed, and it is
-P-A-G-E-417
~ 391 — 
probable by the end of another year, there will be a library in 
practically every school in the county. 
Owing to the fact that the usual sites procured by the old 
Board of Directors for the schools were quite small, and the further 
fact that the land all around them has in most cases been cleared 
up and put in cultivation, our Board has been under the necessity, 
in many cases, of buying additional land at considerable cost. 
But this has been found necessary in order to provide sufficient 
room for the schools. We have also been able to make a sub- 
stantial increase in the average salary paid our teachers. 
Our people are beginning to look upon the question of the 
schools as a business matter. Only a few years ago the estab- 
lishment of a County High School met with considerable oppo- 
sition, but all this has ceased, the High School is a permanent 
addition to our county system, and has been doing excellent 
work, and much benefit has been the result. 
P. H. Duxz, : 
County Superintendent. 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
The schools of Chester County for the past two years have 
made some progress along most linés. We have maintained a 
40 cents tax rate and have been able to give five months each 
year. Our houses are respectable and most of them comfortable 
and adequate to the present demand. Our citizens, as a whole, 
do not take the interest they should in the work and therefore 
rerider the duties of the County Board more difficult. 
Our greatest hindrance, as I see it, is the lack of an efficient 
corps of teachers. We have a new set each session and our 
more experienced ones pass to more permanent and more lucra- 
tive fields. As our report will show, the salaries have been in- 
creased each year and it is questionable whether better work 
is done than heretofore. The county is looking forward and is 
hopeful that a better day will dawn upon ‘the children within 
her. borders.

CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
- The public schools of this county have made wonderful 
progress within the last two years. 
We have now a term of five and one-half months; before this 
we had only three or four months. 
We have had a month’s normal school each of the two past 
years, which I feel sure has proven to be the best work for our 
teachers. 
Each year our County Court has appropriated money to hold 
these normals and the teachers have all taken advantage of 
them, attended well and studied hard. So that our teachers 
as a whole’are 50 per cent better equipped for their work, and have 
increased their salaries at least 25 per cent. Before we had only 
one week for this kind of work ard no experienced teachers, 
with two of these devoted to examinations; so that almost no 
‘benefits were derived from them that would in any way help 
our teachers. 
Our county has levied a high school tax and established a 
County High School, which opened the first of September with 
a good enrollment and has grown very rapidly since. Our high 
school building is nearing completion and we hope to have it 
ready to occupy after the holidays. It is a brick building, 
60x90, with eight recitation rooms. 
A large number of our school houses have been equipped with 
modern desks and blackboards. We have added ten new build- 
ings to our list within the last two years, and some weak schools 
have been thrown together and made strong central schools. 
This, I believe, is one of the best moves a county can make to 
improve its schools. 
Our county has a 25 cent levy in addition to the 15 cent levy 
by the State; then we have a 10 cent levy for the high school, 
making in sum total about $26,000 to our county for public 
school purposes. 
We have ninety-four free schools, eighty-eight white and six 
colored. ‘The Lincoln Memorial University is located in our 
county. It has yearly about 300 students. 
Our attendance is not what it should be by any means. There 
is. riot over 60 per cent of our pupils in school, notwithstanding 
we have a local compulsory school law; there is nearly one-third 
who don’t enroll.
-P-A-G-E-419
— 393 — 
Monthly institutes are held over the county for the benefit 
of the teachers and patrons. The former get good results and 
are greatly strengthened, while the latter fail to attend very much. 
We had hoped this year to better the attendance by getting 
the patrons out to these meetings and arousing them up to some 
extent. In some places much has been done in this way while 
in other places not so much has been done.

CLAY COUNTY. 
We had no libraries in Clay County until this year, but we 
have established fourteen this fall, and everything looks as though 
we will have one in each school of the county in the near future. 
We have four school improvement associations in our county 
and they are doing much good work. We observed arbor day 
last year and planted trees and flowers on the school grounds 
that did not already have good shade. Our grounds have been 
improved much this year. . 
We have built eight new houses this year at a cost of about 
$600 each. We now have an up-to-date framed house in every 
section of our county where school is taught. oo 
We have also bought five hundred single desks. A number 
of our teachers have bought maps and globes. : 
We have no high school, and it seems that the majority of 
our citizens are opposed to the county high school, but I think 
_we will have at least one in the future. 
' The attendance is fifteen per cent better than ever before in 
the history of the county; ninety-eight per cent of the scholas- 
tic population was enrolled this year. 
Great has been the progress in educational matters in Clay 
County, yet only a beginning has been made toward the educa- 
ting ofall the people of tlie county. For these changes and ad-

COCKE COUNTY. 
The schools of Cocke County are progressing in every way 
with two exceptions, and those are as follows: We have no 
school improvement association, and our local tax is very small. 
Next year our local tax will be increased from five cents to 
fifteen or twenty cents, and we are going to make an effort for 
twenty-five cents. 
We expect to organize at least a few improvement associa- 
tions the coming year. Our schools are short, and from this 
fact it is rather difficult to interest our teachers, as most all im- 
provements made would vanish before the next term. 
We have nine libraries in the county, including the city 
school library. Two years ago the county had two, so we aré 
making slow but steady growth. The State aid for libraries 
has been a stimulus to some communities. 
Our county has built three houses this year, costing from 
$625 to $825 each, and the fourth is under contract. We have 
placed over one hundred patent desks in our rural schools the 
past year, a thing which had not been done during ten years 
previous. We find that nothing pleases the patrons better than 
to give them a good house well equipped.
-P-A-G-E-423
— 397 ~ 
There is but one school in the county that has any appara- 
tus, and it is a very meager supply. 
We have three County High Schools, two of which are in 
operation, and the third will open first of January. These 
schools are a great help to our county and are doing excellent 
work. 
The average attendance has been considerably increased 
during the year, which I attribute mostly to our local compul- 
sory law. 
The year before the compulsory law went into effect the 
average daily attendance of the scholastic population was 40 
per cent, and the average daily attendance of the enrollment 
was 54 per cent; after the law was put into force the average 
daily attendance of the scholastic population is 63 per cent, and 
the average daily attendance of the enrollment is 73 per cent, 
which shows that the compulsory law begets good results.

COFFEE COUNTY. 
I am glad that we have had a considerable advancement 
along educational lines in Coffee County, and there are many 
things yet to be done in order that the future conditions be what 
are necessary. With regard to libraries, Coffee County has, or 
will have by the time the available funds are sent in, libraries 
for over half of the county schools, or about thirty in all. ‘These 
libraries are being used and the schools are certainly benefited 
thereby. In some places in the county the school improvement. 
interest has been splendid and the teachers are awakening, to 
the fact that this department should receive special attention. 
.Three new school buildings have been erected this year and sev- 
eral schools have been supplied with new desks. We need ‘more 
consolidations in Coffee County. The Coffee County High School
-P-A-G-E-425
— 399 — 
located at Manchester, is well attended and the benefits derived 
from such institution is already felt. 
. We have a school tax now of 774 cents. Seventeen and one- 
half cents however, is a special tax for the completion of the 
high school building. Our attendance this year is an increase 
over the last of about 10 per cent. We have regular monthly 
Reading Circle meetings and they are well attended. ,

CROCKETT COUNTY. 
It has been said : ‘‘As is the teacher, so is the school.” Judging 
by this rule, the schools of Crockett County have certainly made 
wonderful progress for good during the last two years. Our 
two last summer institutes were very interesting and profitable. 
The spirit of advancement is by no means confined to the teachers, 
but’ our people generally manifest more interest in educating 
their children than ever. By a visit to our schools one can find. 
better discipline, better study, better recitations, and a higher 
grade of teaching. I attribute much of this improvement in our - 
schools to the educational campaigns that have been waged in 
our State for the last two years. But everything has not been 
lovely during the last two years. Several of our school houses 
have been burned. Whether this was the result of accident, 
or the work of incendiarism, we are unable to say. 
New and substantial buildings have been erected on the same 
ground in all these cases except the Maury City school house, 
which was the last to burn. This was a good building in which 
was being taught one of the best schools in the county. We hope 
Maury City will soon have another good building that her children 
may be in school again. 
Our court has always been liberal in its dealings with our 
schools. With the 15 cents levied by the State, our school tax 
is 45 cents on the hundred dollars worth of property, besides the 
poll tax and tax on privileges. In only a few instances has this 
fund been misapplied. As you know, our county is working 
under the District Unit System. Of course, this is not as it 
should be. We are hoping that this may not always be the case. 
In a few cases our directors have made mistakes. In one case, 
the District Board advanced the wages of their teacher without 
consulting the teacher. She was already getting fully as much as
-P-A-G-E-427
— 401 .— } 
the school was worth. In another case the directors agreed to 
erect a school house where there was very little need for it. It 
stands now without a school, and may never have a school in it. 
But as a rule our directors are very careful in making expenses 
where not needed. 
Our schools are in session about six months in the year. 
Any boy or gitl who has the advantage of a good public school 
for six months in the year, and can’t finish the public school 
course in twelve years, ought to retire from school and-try te 
do something in the world that doesn’t require much knowledge 
of books, _ 
All things considered we think we have done well during the 
last tw6 years and are now in fine condition.

    Our annual institute for Crockett County began. at Alamo,

CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
Cumberland County was the first county in the State. to 
organize a County High School. Under the present law a tax 
was levied, teachers employed and the school started in the 
Academy building at Crossville in conjunction with the Crossville 
~ Public School, but as the school was a new thing, the tax being 
pretty high and the people not being educated up to it, and besides 
- not having a home of its own in suitable buildings and dormitories, 
the opposition succeeded in having the County Court refuse’to 
levy a tax for the support of the school and for six years it lay 
dormant. Meanwhile public spirited and influential men: in- 
duced the County Court to levy a tax to build a home forthe 
school and to furnish it. A splendid stone building was erected 
with eight rooms, including a large auditorium or study room, 
auu turmuusnea wich single desks and recitation seats. A ‘tax 
_-- was levied for the support of the school, and last July, by way of 
~ dnaugurating it, the County High School Board furnished the .
-P-A-G-E-429
—~ 403 — 
building and funds to run a summer school for my teachers for 
six weeks. A year ago each teacher paid five dollars tuition 
for the six weeks’ school that I conducted for them. This year 
they got the same work free of tuition under the auspices of the 
High School Board. The enrollment was 104 and the session 
most interesting and productive of good. 
Last October the High School proper was started with myself 
as principal and with an enrollment of eighty-six students, The 
session closed the day before Christmas for one week’s vacation, 
and on the third of this month was resumed with an enrollment 
of 157 students, many of them teachers and others preparing 
to teach. For five months this term will continue, and: consid- 
ering the enthusiasm, both of the instructors and students, the 
outlook presages a most successful year in the high school work. 
About eight years ago I began a crusade for libraries in the 
county school and succeeded in placing a fairly good one in 
about two-thirds of the schools of the county.. In some instances 
the then local boards purchased the books and cases, in others 
the schools held entertainments, box suppers, etc., and secured 
the funds. Under the recent law we have not yet made applica- 
tion for libraries, but hope ere long to do so. : : 
About the same time eight years ago I graded the schools 
of Cumberland County, furnishing each clerk of the district a 
printed copy, besides printing the course in tablet form, and at- 
taching to a board and: hanging up in every school house in the 
county. Since then I have insisted on the teachers complying 
with this graded course, putting the pupils into the grade as closely 
as possible; promoting from grade to grade by examination 
until they enter the County High School. 
Of the work as outliried by the School Improvement Associa- 
tion we have not done much as yet, but we have organized a 
local association with Mrs. L. D. Hill, President; Miss Beatrice 
Sabim, Secretary, and Geo. P. Burnett, Treasurer, and are ready 
for. work along these lines. 
We are, however, building better school houses, seating them 
‘with patent desks, putting mottoes and pictures on the walls, 
planting trees and fencing the grounds and thus making some 
little advancement: along the line as laid down by the association. 
‘The demands of the teachers’ Reading Circle are carried out 
_ in our high school work, and as nearly all our teachers attend
-P-A-G-E-430
— 404 — 
this school, the most of them get the benefit of direct instructions 
in. this line. 
Cumberland County is one of the few counties in the State 
that has a compulsory system of education in operation, and 
although in its infancy, it has had a marked effect upon the 
attendance in the county schools. 
For twenty years Cumberland County has been one of the 
most cosmopolitian counties in the state. And the spirit the schools 
partakes largely of this cosmopolitian spirit and have thus been 
near the top in method and enthusiasm, but each year I think 
I can see a distinct advance as we add little by little to the store 
we have and steadily pursue our course along definite lines of 
practical improvement. :

DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
In this county twenty (20) schools have applied for State 
aid in establishing public school libraries, expending for books 
$690. ‘The intelligent use of these books not only supplements 
text book work, but also creates a desire for good literature, a 
want seldom gratified in the average country home. 
We have but few regularly organized School Improvement 
Associations, but in all, our school teachers and pupils recognize 
the value of attractive surroundings. Almost without exception, 
yards and floors are kept clean, mottoes and pictures are on the 
- walls, and a special effort is made to provide for the health and 
comfort of our ptpils. 
A marked impetus has been given this work on account of 
the fact that many of our school houses are new. Within the last 
year thirteen (13) buildings have been erected at a cost of nearly 
$20,000. For the fall term of 1910 two other buildings will be 
completed, costing about $3,000 each. 
We need five or six additional houses of this class in order 
to have well graded secondary schools, convenient to all parts 
of the county. Davidson County has no High School, nor is it
-P-A-G-E-432
— 406 — 
desirable to erect one, if satisfactory terms can be made with the. . 
city of Nashville for county pupils to attend the new City High 
‘ School when completed. At least four-fifths of our county pupils 
would find this High School more convenient than one located 
elsewhere. At the July term of the County Court the tax levy 
for schools was raised from 3 mills to 4 mills. This increase’ to- 
gether with a distinct advance in taxable values, will enable our 
schools to enjoy a uniform term of nine (9) months, and also 
increase teachers’ salaries. tas 
The average salary at present is $46 per month. In the north- 
ern part of. olir county, a region of orchard and berry farms, 
schools open and close one month earlier than in the central basin, 
thereby securing better attendance for the latter part of the ses- 
sion. : / 
‘This plan interferes somewhat with uniform examinations 
for promotion, but its practical results have been satisfactory. 
The county unit plan of school government is constantly growing. 
in favor, and its good results are seen in longer terms and more 
‘efficient work. /

DECATUR COUNTY. 
I beg te submit the following report: 
There was a great improvement during the past two years 
in the educational conditions of our county. Through the efforts 
of J. C. Duck and myself, a public library was established at
-P-A-G-E-434
— 408 — 
Parsons, and I am using my efforts to have others established 
soon. 
The teachers taught better schools during the past year than 
ever before. But for the want of more money and longer terms, 
our best teachers are continually leaving us, going where the 
school term is longer or seeking other professions. 
There has been, since the passage of the late school law, an 
agitation for the election of a County Superintendent who will 
devote his entire time to the duties of his office. This we feel will 
be done at the January term of court, and we feel that it will 
do a great deal toward increasing the educational interest of the 
county. . °

  R. E. CorLEw, : 
County Superintendent. 
DYER COUNTY. 
I submit the following report for Dyer County for the school 
year ending June 30, 1910: 
At the beginning of the year we had only one school library 
worth mentioning. Now we have four very good ones; five 
schools have almost raised the necessary sums for new libraries, 
_and more are working hard on their library funds. Most of our 
schools were dismissed early in September, and will not begin 
again until January. We hope to have at least twenty more 
begin work on library funds before next February. 
The number of School Improvement Associations is small, as 
so few of the schools are in session, but most of the teachers seem 
to be very enthusiastic, and we hope for great things later. The 
teachers, directors and Superintendent have done a great deal 
of work in improving the heating, lighting, ventilation and general 
appearance of the schools, whether in session or not. One hour 
will be given to the work of the county and local associations 
at each of the monthly teachers’ meetings. 
Since our county was put back under the three directors’ 
system no new school houses have been built and very little 
furniture and apparatus has been bought. Our chief need is 
. apparatus, as the County Board built new houses where they 
were badly needed, and also put in nearly five thousand dollars 
worth of desks and blackboards. 
Our County Court, by a small majority, refused to levy a high 
school tax. We are now at work to get the levy at the April, 
1911, court. The citizens of Dyersburg propose to build a dor- 
mitory for the students if one of the high schools is located in 
Dyersburg. 
At the April term of County Court five cents was added to the 
school tax, making it forty cents on the hundred dollars. This 
is especially encouraging as an indication of the change of senti-
-P-A-G-E-439
— 413 — 
ment toward education, as all motions for a higher tax have been 
promptly voted down by former courts. It is principally because - 
of this encouragement that we fee) so sure of getting a high school 
tax levied next April. | 
There is a strong sentiment in this county for a compulsory 
attendance law. Our attendance problem has been partially 
solved by giving the children more comfortable and attractive 
surroundings, by the employment of more and better teachers 
and the improvement of methods and grading, by having each 
school select colors and get a school banner (this seems to make 
the children realize that the school is really theirs more than 
anything we have ever tried), and by calling the parents together 
at the school once a month to talk over local school affairs. 
We always have the monthly reachers’ meetings at some 
school or country church. All the people for miles around come 
and spend the day. They come to spend the day, have a good 
time and eat dinner on the grounds and they hear school matters 
discussed and talk about them, if they feel like it, and their interest 
is awakened. 
The teachers, directors and superintendent always make it a 
point to secure, whenever possible, the approval and co-operation 
of the patrons in all school matters. 
Juuia D. WALKER, 
County Superintendent. 
FAYETTE COUNTY. 
We held no County Institute this summer for the following 
reason: We arranged with our County High School to provide 
a hurried review on the Public School branches and add courses 
in the State Reading Circle and other professional branches for 
the last six weeks of the term. As our primary schools had 
closed before this course began, and many of our secondary 
schools closed in time for a part of this course, we induced 
almost all of our teachers to attend this course, which was fol- 
lowed by the teachers’ examinations. Our County Board had 
offered a slight increase in salary to our young teachers who 
would take this course, and pass satisfactorily. As our High 
School teachers are experienced and skilled as well as earnest,
-P-A-G-E-440
— 4414 — 
  we consider this a rare opportunity for our experiencedyfeacHers. 
- Then, too, it takes the benefits of the County High schookto the 
remhotest parts of the County at once. 
Fayette County High School has closed its first year and has 
succeeded far beyond our most sanguine expectations.” .Many 
who opposed its establishment are now its loyal supporters. 
The second year has opened with an enrollment and can en- 
thusiasism of which we had not dreamed. : 
We are grateful to the State authorities for six circulating 
libraries from the State. These have gone into the schools and 
ate being received with the highest appreciation. 
Some of otr schools have accepted the offer of aid from the 
State in establishing and increasing libraries, and Iam pleased 
to note that our people are waking up to this opportunity in real 
earnest. There are now more such libraries in process of establish- 
ment than have been established during the last year. 
Many of our schools now have School Improvement Asso- 
ciations which are doing good work. 
We are now experimenting with small school gaxdens for 
schools where teachers and pupils seem interested. Our County 
Board has agreed to furnish the woven wire for the fence, where 
the school will do the rest. These gardens are for flowers and 
such other plants as the teacher may select. 
Since your last report our county has increased the county 
tax for general school purposes by fifteen cents, as well as given 
us sufficient High School tax to maintain one of the ‘best ‘first- 
class High Schools in the State. With the increased funds it 
has now’ become the fixed policy of the County Board to make 
substantial and permanent improvements in the school houses 
of the county. The houses built during the last year have been 
of a much better and more enduring character than those form-. 
erly built. One was a modern school house of concrete. 
The County Board has given to the Superintendent the 
privilege of ordering any school, in charge of an inexperienced 
teacher, closed for one day, and the teacher to spend the entire 
day with such other school as the Superintendent may designate, 
and observe carefully the work as done there. With the noti- 
fication a return card is sent on which the visiting teacher is 
asked to report on stich observations as she thinks will be of 
help to her in her future work. When. the report is made the 
   
-P-A-G-E-441
— 415 — 
teacher receives her pay just as if she had taught. Of course 
the Superintendent is careful to send teachers where they will 
see skillful work done. Post . 
While our county system has by no means reached our ideal 
we feel that we are making progress. - :

FENTRESS COUNTY. 
Within the past three years Fentress County has built houses 
for about one-half the schools, and within the next two or three 
years comfortable houses will be had for every school in the

Nearly all the schools are now supplied with desks. These 
‘are made of wood, but they serve our purposes fairly well; much 
better than the benches, sometimes made of split logs, that 
were in use before the desks were put in. . 
We now have two County High Schools. They are both 
doing good work. The grades of the teachers have been raised 
as a result of these schools, and too, they have helped to bring 
up the number of teachers until we have several more teachers 
than schools. . . 
Twenty-five cents is levied for the elementary schools, be- 
sides the full amount allowed by law on privileges and polls. 
Fifteen cents is levied for the High schools.. Taxpayers are 
willing to pay as much money for schools as they believe to be 
well spent. If it were not for the building of so many houses, 
schools might now run six months each year. 
The attendance is much better now than it was two years — 
ago. - People take a greater interest in education, and the com- 
pulsory law has caused many children to attend school who 
before the passage of the law were kept out. No one has yet 
been prosecuted for violation of this law, but there will be several’ 
suits brought the first of the year 1911. . 
‘The people are not satisfied with present conditions, but 
"they are satisfied with the progress made, and hope to reach a 
satisfactory condition in the near future.

FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
The schools of Franklin County are doing reasonably well. 
Our enrollment is larger than any previous year, and our daily - 
attendance is good. Communities seem to be more interested in 
school work, and in many places are doing much toward school 
improvement--such as beautifying school grounds and making 
our buildings more comfortable. . 
We have built and finished six new buildings, besides painting 
and recovering four or five others. Our new buildings are up- 
to-date, costing from $800 to $1,500. We have also bought 
about 300 single desks. 
We are expecting to build four or five new houses year 
in which we will be able to consolidate some of o&x schools. . 
‘The communities in which these new houses are located ate pay- 
ing one-half the expenses. 
We have not done what I feel should have been done towards 
our libraries, but hope to do more soon. 
‘The High School is doing well under the management of 
Prof. A. B. Armstrong. We have had this year the largest at- 
tendance the school has ever had, and are expecting an increase 
next term. The greatest hindrance to our High School is the 
lack of money. I hope to get a raise in taxation at our January 
term of County Court. 
Our entire school tax is 40 cents for Public Schools, and 5 
cents per $100 for High Schoo]. This we feel is too low, and 
hope to get it to 60 cents at our next court.

J. W. TEMPLETON, 
County Superintendent. 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
We have been delayed about making this report owing to the 
fact that it was impossible for us to obtain full and accurate 
statistics from some of our city schools. 
From some of these schools we have not yet received. reports, 
in consequence of which you will observe in this report a defi-
-P-A-G-E-445
— 419 — 
ciency in the enrollment and average daily attendance of the’ 
cities, also in the enrollment in each branch of study, otherwise: 
our report is complete and accurate. 
In consideration of the fact that we have always had more 
or less trouble in securing reports from the city schools, we are 
lead to conclude that all warrants for teachers, both city and 
county, should be required to be approved by the County Super- 
intendent before they are payable by the trustee. If this were 
mandatory the Superintendent could demand that all reports 
shall be filed with him before he would approve any city school 
warrant payable by the County Trustee out of State and County 
funds. 
Under the cld District Board Law when the directors of. 
country schools issued all school warrants for teaching, County 
Superintendents had the same trouble about getting reports 
from the country schools that they now have with city schools, 
since they had rio means of forcing any teacher to file with them 
mothly reports or term abstracts. 
Under this system the County Superintendent’s annual re- 
port to the State Superintendent was a mere farce and abso- 
lutely worthless except as to the financial statistics obtained from 
the County Trustee’s books. 
The County Board Law obviates this trouble in so far as the 
schools under the supervision of the County Boards are concerned, 
since the County Superintendent, Secretary ex-officio of said ~ 
County Board, issues every warrant and can withhold a teacher’s 
warrant till all reports and abstracts are filed with him. 
We have on file a full and complete report of every school un- 
der the supervision of the County Board of Education. From 
these data the records of the Secretary of the County Board, and 
the County Trustee’s books we are able to make a full and com- — 
plete report as to all schools in the county except the city schools. 
City Superintendents often feel that they are under no obli- 
gations to make reports to the County Superintendent and in 
some instances act accordingly. 
We have had very good interest in our schools the past year, 
most of our-schools continuing 140 days. Our teachers have 
manifested more interest in their school work than hitherto. 
The average length of term has been lessened only one day by 
reason of the fact that four of our school houses burned during.
-P-A-G-E-446
— 420 — 
the winter, and in some neighborhoods we had an epidemic of 
measles and whooping cough. 
Our finances have been somewhat straitened from the opin- 
ion rendered by the Attorney-General that the schools were not 
entitled to the entire 25 per cent of the gross revenues of the 
State, and that our County School tax was decreased ten cents 
on the hundred dollars with the view that the decrease would be 
replaced by the increase on property. assessments. 
‘You will also observe that the average salary of teachers this 
year is $45.36 as against $35.85 last year. 
Much interest has been aroused by the Superintendent in 
the schools in agricultural education. We have organized a 
County School Boys’ Corn Contest Club of 425: school boys, the 
Jargest in the entire South. Each of these boys agreed to plant 
and cultivate one acre of corn. We have over 400 acres of fine 
corn grown by these schools. The Government furnished these 
boys free bulletins on the cultivation, fertilization and growing 
of corn, This has been a practical means in the education of 
these boys in the theory and practice of intelligent and scientific 
farming. 
Our teachers are beginning to wake up to the importance of 
establishing school libraries in their respective schools. 
Our people are becoming interested in school improvement 
work. ‘They ate clamoring for better houses, better equipments, 
and more attractive school environments. 
Our County Board at its last meeting agreed to inaugurate 
a county campaign for more funds, and a stronger school spirit 
of progress. 
The future for our schools seems very hopeful and promising. 
Herewith I submit my Institute report for white teachers, 
held at Trenton, Gibson County, Tennessee. 
This proved to be one of the best County Institutes ever held 
in the county. 
The teachers were more interested than ever before at an 
institute. The instructors with one or two exceptions did better 
teaching than is usually done. ‘The teachers did better and 
made better grades on examinations than ever before. We ac- 
count for this on the fact that we had generally excellent in- 
struction, and better and harder work was done on the part of 
the teachers themselves.
-P-A-G-E-447

I am highly pleased with the work done in the institute this 
year; I am sure this institute will produce good results in the 
work of our schools this year. 
On a separate sheet we are sending you a report of our col- 
ored Institute held at the same time under the immediate super- 
vision of Profs. I. M. Stegall, J. F. Booker and P. H. Watson. 
This institute made an enviable record, showing excellent work, 
good attendance and great interest. We are expecting great 
things of our rural schools this year. :

The County Institute for 1910 was characterized by the best 
attendance and hardest work ever seen here. I cannot say too 
much for those who aided me: Each instructor had the line 
of work for which he or she was especially fitted, and no one 
teacher had over two subjects a day. On these special prepa- 
ration was required. Result—no dragging nor uninteresting.: 
periods. Program arranged to give time for preparation each 
day. I am delighted with results, and like the plan far better 
_ than two or four instructors.

was well attended by teachers, students and citizens. The in-

The public schools of Grainger County are improving each 
year. The people are now more interested in the schools and 
in the education of their children in Grainger County than at 
any time heretofore. All the people are well pleased with the 
compulsory school law that applies to Grainger County, and 
many seem to think it would be better to extend it to the age of 
sixteen. 
We are well pleased with the graded course of study for the 
elementary schools, which has just been furnished the teachers 
by the State. Superintendent.

GREENE COUNTY. 
Greene County teachers have just begun to interest them- 
selves in the work of securing libraries for the rural schools. So 
far only two:schools have taken advantage of the liberal appro- 
priation made by the State for the purpose of encouraging the 
establishment of libraries, but I have assurances that others 
will make application before the close of the present school 
term. : 
The schoot improvement spirit is really more in evidence in 
some of the communities here than the work of the School Im- 
provement Association would indicate. In one school, in par- 
ticular, the grounds had the appearance of being under the care 
of a landscape gardener when I visited the school in the month 
of August. There were fifty-seven varieties of beautiful flowers 
growing on the lawn. Walks were laid off. The space between 
the walks was in blue grass and on the borders were flowers and 
evergreens. 
In other schools the buildings have been painted and the
-P-A-G-E-453
— 427 — 
grounds beautified through the efforts of those interested:in the 
work of the Association. 
Finding that many of the school buildings were poorly seated, 
I recommended that new desks should be furnished to take the 
place of the benches and other makeshifts with which many. of 
the school buildings had been provided. The County - Board 
concurred in my recommendation and we have already placed 
new double and single desks in nearly all schools’ where they 
had not been previously supplied. 
We have established a central County High School by com- 
bining with the Greeneville High School. The work is pro- 
gressing nicely, although the appropriation was not secured 
from the County Court until the April, 1910, term. The course 
of study has been adopted and a contract entered into between 
_the County and City High School Boards, providing for the ac- 
commodation of all the pupils who may desire to enter from 
this county. 
We have.a school tax of 40 cents on the $100 of taxable prop- 
“erty for public schools, 5 cents for High schools and $2 poll tax. 
We have no compulsory attendance Jaw in this county, yet 
one is very much needed. The question of getting the children 
in school and keeping them there every day of the school term 
is one that should command the attention of the educators of 
this State. We need a compulsory attendance law that will be 
effective, and a satisfactory solution of the attendance problem 
will not be made until such a law is placed upon our statute 
books. 
We have erected five 3-room, three 2-room, and four 1-room 
school buildings, all after the plans furnished by the State Super- 
intendent, the total cost of, the twelve buildings being about 
$14,000. Half of this money was furnished by the patrons under 
the plans which I adopted in the matter of consolidating and 
improving the public schools. 
We have many problems that are yet to be solved. But we 
have in Greene County a citizenship which places education in 
the front rank of the things that should have consideration. 
And, while there may be, for a time, a halt in the onward march 
toward better things for the Greéne County schools, I am sure 
that nothing will be permitted to retard their progress for any 
greater length of time than it will require for-the people to dis-

a way for their removal will be found.

GRUNDY COUNTY. 
Complying with your request of November 8 will state that 
the educational progress of Grundy County for the past two 
years is very marked. The people have grown more in favor of 
consolidation, thus paving the way for fewer and better schools. 
ScHoo, LIBRARIES. 
Some few of our teachers are, by way of public entertainments 
making progress towards establishing public libraries in the rural 
districts. One great trouble in insisting on the teachers to take 
an active part in the establishing of these libraries, is the State 
furnishes too little of the funds. 
ScHoo, IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS. 
We have no School Improvement Associations in our county. 
The teachers and patrons look too much to the County Board 
of Education for all necessary improvements. We need more 
money for equipment, such as new houses, apparatus, etc. We 
are consolidating our schools, building modern school houses, 
furnishing them with single patent desks, and eliminating as fast 
as we can the old-fashioned crayon, using in its stead dustless 
crayon and talc.
-P-A-G-E-456
—~ 430 — 
County Hic SCHOOL. 
So far we have not established a County High School. We 
have two or three sécondary schools in each district. ‘These 
secondary schools are so located as to accommodate all pupils 
finishing primary schools in their districts. 
Qur County Court is becoming more interested in the County 
High School subject. It is a matter of only a short time when 
Grundy County will keep pace with the best school counties in _ 
the State. 
ATTENDANCE, ETC. 
The attendance is not what it should be. The attendance 
for 1909 was better than it has been in 1910. In 1909, in visiting 
the schools, I impressed the children with the fact that the com- 
pulsory school law applied to Grundy County. They seem to 
think this year that there is not much in just the kind of com- 
pulsory law we have. I would like to add—the children are 
tight. Our attendance will never be what it should be until 
we have a State compulsory school law. My desire is that the 
next legislature will pass just such a bill. 
Locay TaxaTIon. 
“The poll tax is $1.00. The property tax is forty cents on the 
hundred dollars’ worth. I am pleased to state that our County - 
Court is growing more-in favor of a better property tax.

HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
Since the passage of the General Educational Bill we have 
procured three school libraries for our rural schools, one of which 
was lost by fire. We have several schools that are working to 
raise funds for libraries. Last spring we organized our county
-P-A-G-E-458
— 432 — 
into a School Improvement Association, but as yet we have 
but few local organizations. 
We are slowly equipping ourselves with better houses and 
apparatus. We have built one new house this year and have 
purchased 150 new desks. 
We lost one of our best houses last April by fire. We lost 
in this building 100 desks, a large library and one piano. 
Last April our County Court increased our school tax by a 
levy of 10 cents extra on the $100. This will give us a very good 
school fund. We hope to have money enough now to run our 
schools seven months. 
The attendance of our schools is better than last year, but still 
we are not satisfied, but hope to have better attendance. 
The County High School question was brought up at the 
January court, but failed to pass. The County High School 
is coming in a very few years, for now I can see that there is a 
sentiment growing in its favor.

HAMILTON COUNTY. 
LIBRARIES. 
The school library movement has greatly profited by the im- 
petus given it under the provisions of the General Education 
Bill, Acts of 1909, State General Assembly. Hamilton County 
now has forty-five school libraries“ with approximately 3,000 
copies,’ valued at about $2,000. 
Preparations are under way for a material increase in this | 
number within the present year. 
Scuoo, IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS. 
There have been organized thirty-three School Improvement 
Associations—twenty-five white and eight colored, that are
-P-A-G-E-460
— 434 — 
doing some very commendable work in grading and fencing 
school grounds, repairing, painting and decorating school build- 
ings, furnishing pianos, adding school fixtures, encouraging 
library development and in general looking after the welfare of 
the whole school. The County Chairman, Prof. J. A. Setliff, 
and his associates have aided very materially the work of the local 
organization. 
New BulLpincs. 
During the past year Hamilton County has built nine school 
houses at an approximate cost of $75,000. ‘These schools are of 
the modern type in arrangement, in heating, lighting and venti- 
lation and have been equipped with modern desks, chairs, teachers’ 
desks, and in the larger schools chairs for the auditoriums. 
- HicH ScHoo.s. 
Hamilton County has a system of five high schools erected 
and equipped at an approximate cost of $150,000. 
Central, the suburban high school, maintains the following 
departments: Classical, Scientific, Manual Training, Domestic 
Arts, Normal Training, Commercial, Expression and Music. 
The four rural high schools each maintain the Classical, 
Scientific and Agricultural Departments and three of these Do- 
' mestic Art Departments. 
Central has a faculty of seventeen teachers and each of the 
four rural schools a faculty of three. 
The entire high school enrollment for the county is 710. 
In every way these schools have been a great boon to the 
educational interests of our county. 
Loca, Tax Levy. 
‘The local tax levy for grammar school purposes is 27 cents on 
the $100. The levy for high schools is 8 cents on the $100. The 
total amount received for school purposes from local tax, from 
the State and all other sources, aggregates $205,000 for grammar 
schools and $33,000 for high schools. 
For the use of schools exclusive of the city, $125,000 for gram- 
mar schools and $33,000 for high schools. 
ComPULSORY ScHooL Law. 
Hamilton County has no compulsory school attendance law.
-P-A-G-E-461
— 435 — 
However, the attendance has been considerably augmented by 
the systematic campaign teachers have made among the parents 
of their respective communities. The needs of children of in- 
digent parents have been referred to the School Improvement 
Associations for their immediate attention. As a result of these 
campaigns the schools now stand in greater favor with the im- 
provident classes than ever before. 
County INSTITUTE. 
The Hamilton County Institute opened May. 30, 1910, and 
closed June 24. The faculty consisted of fifteen members which 
enabled us to review the major portion of subjects required to be 
taught in grammar and high schools and in addition to do special 
work in Agriculture, Domestic Arts, Manual Training and Primary 
Methods. The State Reading Circle work marks a special feature 
of our Institute, the interest taken not being excelled by any 
other work. Special lectures on literature and education were _ 
delivered by Dr. Lincoln Hulley, of John B. Stetson University.

HANCOCK COUNTY. 
In compliance with your request I hereby submit a report 
of the school system of my county for the years 1909-1910. 
It gives me much pleasure to report continued advancement 
in the standard of teachers and schools of Hancock County. 
The era of progress that dawned a few years ago is still moving 
steadily onward and bearing much good fruit, to-day finds us 
possessed of a public school spirit unsurpassed by any county 
in the State. However, we have much yet to accomplish, but 
with a people whose greatest desire is the advancement of their 
children, we expect to move steadily onward towards the goal. 
Our people seem to have realized that no school: can do effi- 
cient work without at least a small library, containing books 
suitable to the different periods of the child’s life. When I 
made my report in 1908 there was not a school in the county that 
could boast of-a library, but now we have twenty-one libraries, 
containing in all 1,021 good wholesome books valued at $485.
-P-A-G-E-463
— 437 — 
The greater number of our books was secured by private dona- 
tions, the total cost to the patrons and State being only $215. 
In addition to the above our County Association established a 
library in the County Superintendent’s office in 1908 and it now 
has more than $200 worth of pedagogical literature -in it.. I 
find the teachers’ library one of the greatest factors in the im- 
provement of school ideas and conditions. 
Four years ago the teachers of our county organized a local 
association styled the Claxton Education Association of Han- 
cock County. The association has done much to create the good 
school sentiment that we have now. The educational campaigns 
waged by the association have done much towards arousing the 
people to the great need of better houses and equipment. 
We have erected and purchased during the last two years 
seven splendid school buildings (value $5,950) at a cost to the 
county of $2,300, the remainder being raised by popular sub- 
setiption. Last year we bought $1,200 worth of school desks 
at a cost of only $500 to the county. 
-Provisions for the establishment of a County High School 
were made by the County Court at its July session in 1909. Being 
without funds with which to erect and equip a suitable building, 
-the board decided to offer the school to the community making 
the best .offer, provided due consideration be given central 
location. After hearing the various offers the board accepted 
the offer made by Sneedville, consisting of the splendid building 
and equipment of the Sneedville Central Mission school, valued 
at $4,000. The school opened August 29, 1910, with a splendid 
corps of teachers in charge. ‘The school has a large enrollment 
and bids fair to be one of the best of its class in the State. 
We have an excellent County Court that is ever ready to meet 
any demands that look to the betterment of our county schools. 
We levy fifteen cents for High School, forty for common schools, 
and two dollars poll. 
Now, let us see if a compulsory school law is worth anything. 
In 1908 the total enrollment for the county was 3,361, with an 
average daily attendance of only 1,431. In 1909, under the com- 
pulsory law, the total enrollment was 3,233 with an average daily 
attendance of 2,139. This shows that for the whole term the 
law kept a daily average attendance of more than 700 increase, 
for the whole term, over the former year, or an increase of 334
-P-A-G-E-464
—~ 438 — 
per cent. Doesn’t this look like the proper method of driving 
the greatest curse—illiteracy—out of Tennessee? 
While these have been glorious years in our county, and Ten- 
nessee in general, the work is just well under way. We must 
double the energy we have heretofore put in the work. ‘This 
great educational crusade must go on. There is no time to lose, 
we must convince the patrons that the future destiny of their _ 
boys depends upon the home school. 
The farmer must be educated. We cannot develop the country 
until we educate its citizens. The farmer must read farm papers 
and build on the progress of his fellow men. 
What we as superintendents in Tennessee need most is pluck 
and plod. We are all too weak-kneed to make the success that 
is ours for the going after. Let us all make a united pull and 
Tennessee will blossom as a rose. Then, indeed, will the dream 
of our fathers come into glorious frutage. Not only will our 
homes be filled with plenty, good society and splendid churches, 
good roads and bridges, fine stock and fat acres greet the eyes 
of an awakened people, but every industry and institution known 
to our land will grow with renewed energy as if fresh blood had 
been poured into its veins. Let us determine to make the next 
two years far better than the past two. :

HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
The educational outlook for Hardeman County is encouraging. 
At last the people seem to be aroused. We now have a 40 per 
cent tax levy, and the County High School is sure to come.
-P-A-G-E-466
— 440 — 
There are two new school libraries now in the county, and 
we will have several more in the near future. 
Three schools have just organized a School Improvement 
Association, and the teachers will extend their work over the 
entire county. . 
Five new school houses are now in course of construction. 
These are rural houses and wili be furnished with patent desks, 
and other necessary apparatus. 
We have a nine months’ free school in every district except 
one, and one central school to which all public school pupils of 
the county may go without charge. On the whole we feel en- 
couraged in Hardeman. :

HARDIN COUNTY. 
The biggest, livest, and most profitable business in the isolated 
county of Hardin is the school business. 
' The educational progress in this county for the past two 
years has been very marked along many lines. Through our 
regular teachers’ meetings, from reading course work, and by . 
means of tigid examinations our teachers are becoming better 
equipped for their profession. 
The organized association meets regularly each month for 
study and exchange of ideas on school topics. A large per cent 
‘of the teaching force make a special study of the reading course 
texts. At the monthly meetings, which are well attended 
throughout the year, vital school topics are studied and discussed 
with a view to making the schools more efficient.
-P-A-G-E-468
— 442 — 
Many localities have libraries, but these are insufficient to 
meet the demands of the day. The county is being campaigned 
and awakened in the interest of more libraries and better ones, 
and we believe it will be but a short time till a number of places 
will ask for aid from the State fund. 
The enrollment and attendance last school year was the best 
in the history of the county. This is but the natural result of 
an annual campaign through the several districts. The people 
are awake, enthusiastic and at work along educational lines. 
The outlook is very hopeful.

HAWKINS COUNTY. 
I am sending you herewith my annual report for the year 
ending June 30th, 1910. It is with a great deal of pleasure 
that I report a substantial degree of progress for the schools of 
this county. 
The enrollment in our schools last year increased from 6,088 
to 6,986. The average daily attendance increased from 4,168 
to 4,983. This increase in enrollment and attendance was due 
mainly.to the compulsory school law in effect in this county. 
The scholastic population of the rural districts is 8,429. The 
number who can read and write, 7,178. 
We have been hampered by a lack of funds. Small counties, 
even though they levy a high rate of taxation, cannot raise 
school funds sufficient to accomplish any vast improvement in 
the way of modern buildings and at the same time maintain the 
school terms of a reasonable length. However, we still keep at 
work building school houses and buying patent desks. Two 
new railroads have just been completed, which traverse the county
-P-A-G-E-470
— 444 — 
a distance of forty-five (45) miles. The taxation for- schools 
from these railroads will run our schools about one month longer. 
‘The County Board system is working admirably in this coun- 
ty. Our school work is in better condition than I have ever seen 
it before. We get reports from teachers promptly at the end 
* of the month, and by visiting the schools and looking over re- 
ports we know much more of school conditions here than for- 
merly. 
. COUNTY INSTITUTE. 
Our county institute was a very successful one this. year. 
Prof. J. W. Trotter of Moses School, Knoxville, did excellent 
work. You could not have sent us an instructor more acceptable. 
Our teachers manifested unusual interest in institute work.

HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
The public schools of Haywood County have shown marked 
improvement all along the line during the past two years. There 
have been few school libraries in this county, but many teachers 
are now at work raising money with which to supply their schools 
with libraries. : 
The material equipment of our schools during the past year 
has been unusual. A number of good buildings have been erected, 
and many old ones have been improved; first-class desks have 
been placed in nearly all of the school buildings of the county; 
blackboards have been furnished where needed; in fact our 
School Board has done everything in its power to render the
-P-A-G-E-472
— 446 — 
school buildings of the county thoroughly comfortable and fit 
for first-class work. 
Haywood County has no County High School at this time, 
but steps are now being taken to secure for the county one of 
the best equipped high schools in the State. 
We believe a local compulsory law would be good for the 
children of this county. Many parents stop their children from 
school at certain seasons of the year to work, when they might 
arrange for the work without interfering with the child’s edu- 
cation. However, there are many people here who could not 
well do without their children during cotton picking time. 
The Superintendent has organized the teachers of the county 
into a study circle, which meets once a month during the school 
year. Teachers who are regular in attendance, and who make 
an average grade of 85 per cent on the work done during the year, 
get their certificates fenewed without further examination, pro- 
. vided their work along other lines is satisfactory. ‘These monthly 
meetings have been well attended during the past year. The 
teachers have taken an interest in the work and have shown 
marked improvement. 
We believe that from every viewpoint the schools of Hay- 
wood County have shown more improvement during the past 
year than we have ever seen before in the county. 
We congratulate our most excellent State Superintendent 
on what appears to us as the best year in the history of the pub- 
lic schools in the State. 
FR. Ocivig, 
County Superintendent. 
HENDERSON COUNTY. 
J am glad to report the schools in Henderson County in better 
condition from every point of view than they have ever been 
since I have known them. 
The teachers are taking a greater interest in schools and 
school work than they have heretofore, attending institutes 
and teachers’ associations, reading more books on teaching, and 
doing better work in general. 
The County Court is taking more interest in education. ‘The 
court has raised the tax levy for school purposes, so that the
-P-A-G-E-473
— 447 — 
term has increased about 45 per cent in the last four years; be- 
sides raising a tax for High School purposes, so that we may 
have two High Schools in Henderson County where any person 
in the county may attend who may be ready for such line of in- 
struction. 
We expect to take steps by another year towards organizing 
corn clubs. We have one in the county this year that has done 
fine work. 
COUNTY INSTITUTE. 
I am glad to report that we had the best County Institute 
ever held in this county in its history, both from a standpoint 
of attendance, and interest of county teachers, and the matter 
of instruction by the faculty.

HENRY COUNTY. 
A most important feature of the educational work of the year, 
and one which was highly pleasing to all the people, particularly 
to the warm friends of education, was the State Institute held 
at the Lee School at Paris. Conductor T. B. Loggins and his 
assistants, Profs. Sherrill, Wright, Bright and Miss Arthur, not 
only gave unbounded satisfaction to all concerned, but really 
captivated the student teachers and others in attendance. We 
feel very grateful to Superintendent Jones for the courtesy of 
placing the institute at Paris. . 
Our people do not seen to appreciate the importance of ac- 
cepting the offer of the State to aid in the establishment of school 
libraries, only four schools of the county having so far taken ad- © 
vantage of it. . 
We have a flourishing County School Improvement Asso- 
ciation and local associations are being organized. 
There has been very little increase in material equipment, 
owing mostly to lack of means. 
The E. W. Grove County High School, one of the best in the 
State, is progressing nicely. Recently there has ‘been built a 
substantial dormitory for girls, and an agricultural department
-P-A-G-E-475
— 449 — 
with an experiment farm, is a new feature in which much interest 
is apparent. . :

HICKMAN COUNTY. 
We are working under the Montgomery County law in Hick- 
man County. Our people are better pleased with this law than 
with the County Board law. Our grade of teachers is much 
better than ever before. We are paying better salaries and 
securing longer terms, and keep better qualified and more ex- 
perienced teachers in our schools. We have inaugurated a report 
and grading system in Hickman County that I think will revo- 
lutionize our schools.

Our school term will be shortened one month this year, which 
we regret very much. This is due to the shortage from the State. 
We think now that within the next year we can establish 
a County High School, which will add greatly to the interest and 
progress of education in this county. . 
We hope to make the coming year one of much and lasting 
good. :

HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
This year closes my fourth and last year as County Superin- 
tendent of Humphreys County, and I herewith submit a brief 
statement of the progress of the county’s edcuational interests 
during these four years. , 
Under the old director system before I was elected, some of 
our public schools were run for three months, some for three 
and one-half, some for four, and some for five and a few for a 
longer length of time, but for the past four years every school 
in the county was run for the same length of time and we have 
had a five months term for each of the four years, and teachers’ 
salaries have been increased on an average of at least 30 per cent. 
We have built three new frame school houses which, including 
the lands on which they were built, which was donated, are worth 
about five thousand dollars or more. The board has purchased 
something like four or five hundred dollars’ worth of new desks, 
and new talc blackboards have been placed in several houses 
to take the place of the old chalk boards. 
At the beginning of my term of office there were about a 
dozen school libraries in the rural schools, which were purchased 
and paid for out of the public funds at a cost of about $1,100. 
For the past.two years, we have raised in the rural schools, not 
including the towns to this writing, from the people $202.35, 
which entitles us to $100 from the State. With this money we 
are purchasing more books and better suited books for our school 
libraries than we formerly paid $1,100 for, and they have not 
cost the public school treasury of the county one cent. Consider- 
able work has been done by the teachers and some money has 
been raised for the improvement of school houses and grounds, ° 
and making them more comfortable and attractive. But just 
how much has been done along this line it is hard to estimate. 
We have been fortunate in having a State Institute for the 
past two years located with us. We have more qualified teachers 
in the county this year than we have ever had. They are taking 
a good interest in their work. 
Our county pays a 40 cents property tax and a $2. 00: poll tax 
for public schools. There is a better interest in public education 
in the county at this time than we have ever had heretofore. 
At the beginning of my term there was no teachers’ library.
-P-A-G-E-478
— 452 — 
We now have a library of about one hundred volumes which 
cost about $125. Most of the teachers accessible to this library 
take advantage of it. 
Four years ago a County High School was not thought of, and 
many did not know what one was, and it was thought to be an 
impossibility, but now there is considerable sentiment for such 
a school, and we hope it will not be a great while until our county 
will be to the front on this line. 
On the whole we consider the greatest thing accomplished is 
the increased growth of sentiment among our people generally 
for better school houses and grounds, better equipment, increased 
efficiency in the teaching force, longer terms, and higher educa- 
tion. The continued cultivation of this sentiment among any 
people will eventually mean much. 
Our public school in Waverly is doing fine work, and is the 
best school we have ever had here. Manual training has been 
introduced and some splendid work was done in this department 
last year. . 
Over two hundred dollars was raised for library and school 
improvement work. 
I have never had a report from the McEwen School, but sup- 
pose that will be reported by its own Superintendent.

Six houses have been erected during the two years just ended, 
costing at least $3,600. Furniture, etc., $1,200. 
HicH ScHOOL. 
County High School established 1909—buildings and grounds 
$10,000. 
We have sixty-four schools, including High School for whites, 
and nine for the negroes. We employ 100 teachers now; 66% per’ 
cent of them are women. 
Our institutes are attended by 50 per cent of the teachers so 
far. We are hoping from recent action of the Board that a full 
attendance will soon be had. We have endeavored to secure 
strong and permanent organization that our teachers may enjoy 
the benefits of mutual helpfulness. Progress is _ being had, 
although not so fast as we wish. 
_ County teachers and officials are organized into the School 
Improvement Association. Considerable interest is being mani- 
fested to make it a permanent movement. Four school com- 
munities have already organized local organizations. and are 
taking considerable interest toward improvements generally. 
The outlook is very promising for wonderful, betterment in 
houses, grounds, equipments, etc.
-P-A-G-E-482
— 456 — 
More than half dozen schools are to have libraries soon. 
Others are endeavoring to raise the money. These schools will 
each raise not less than $20 for this great purpose and need. 
One school deserves especial mention. The boys and girls are 
raising some of the money by their own efforts. Such splendid, 
effort will surely be emulated by other schools. : 
We are striving to present the claims of our schools to the 
minds and consciences of the parents of every community. Have 
had many parents to meet with us. 
We are planning centralization in some sections of the county, 
where under district management schools are almost in sight of 
each other. 
Many communities are much interested in the plan for an 
eight months’ term of school and are getting ready to supplement 
funds to secure it. This.is one thing we have advocated in every 
school community of the county. irl 
We shall have much to indicate progress along the several 
lines to submit next year.

JOHNSON COUNTY. 
We have established two libraries in this county during this 
year and there are good prospects for the establishment of more 
soon. Where the work was put before the patrons of a school 
they responded cheerfully. 
We have only one School Improvement Association in the 
county and it is not very active. This is a want that needs 
pushing in our county. 
We have built two new school houses during the year and 
seated them with new single desks. We have also made improve- 
ments on several other houses, put in new blackboards and im- 
proved the grounds of several. : 
We have one County High School. This one is doing real 
good work and is giving satisfaction. ‘The Principal of our high 
School is an able school man and the attendance and interest 
is increasing all the time. 
Our compulsory law has increased the daily attendance in
-P-A-G-E-483

the county over 700. The law needs some improvement and then 
it will be a great blessing to the children of our county. 
The teaching force of our county has been much strengthened 
in the last two years, which is fast bringing the schools of Johnson 
County to the front.

F. C. DouGHERTY, 
County Superintendent. 
KNOX COUNTY. 
In connection with the statistical report from Knox County, 
I wish to make a statement in regard to a few of the things to 
which we have given special attention. 
‘TEACHERS. 
Believing an intelligent, enthusiastic teacher to be the most 
important factor in a successful school; we have continued to 
give attention to the teaching’ force. 
We have offered greater inducements to the efficient, success- 
ful teacher to remain in the work and less inducement to the 
inexperienced to enter the work. The salaries in our common 
schools now range from $25.00 per month to $80.00 per month. 
Realizing the former inefficiency of primary work, we have 
offered inducements to some of the lady teachers to make special 
preparations to do first grade work. As a result we have some 
' primary rooms that will compare favorably with any work of 
the kind in the best city schools. We have been gradually in- 
. creasing the salaries of skillful teachers. 
Almost all the teachers of the county attend the Summer 
School of the South, our enterprising County Court paying the 
admission fee for all teachers. 
As another means of improving the teachers, we select special- 
ists as instructors in the Reading Circle course. 
At present we have as instructors in this work three members 
of the faculty of the University of Tennessee and one ex-college 
president, each selected because of his special ability to do the 
work assigned him. 
Through these and other means we are trying to hold the 
‘ most successful teachers and to incite enthusiasm in the minds 
of ali the teachers.
-P-A-G-E-485
— 459 — 
Houses AND GROUNDS. 
We found many of the houses, because of poor construction, 
of unsightly appearance, poor equipments and inappropriate 
names, a bar to interest on the part of the children; and many 
of the school sites, because of undesirable location, insufficient 
area and lack of proper attention, a menace to the health of the 
pupils. 
We have sought to improve all these things. Every new 
house has been built on a desirable site of sufficient area and has 
been constructed in accordance with plans of an architect." Some 
of the old houses have been removed. One building was removed 
from one half acre of swampy land to an elevated site consisting 
of a beautiful grove of three acres and the suggestive name 
“Mud Flats” was changed to “High Bluff.” 
Another was taken from a triangular lot of about one fourth 
of an acre bounded on two sides by a barbed wire fence and on 
the third side by a sluggish branch, an attractive two room house 
was erected some distance away on a site of two and one-half 
acres, overlooking a beautiful valley through which the historic 
Holston wends its way, while in one direction the horizon is 
formed by the meeting of the sky and the beautiful Clinch Mount- 
ains. The appropriate name Sand Branche was changed to 
“Ramsey,” the latter name being given in memory of Doctor 
J. M. G. Ramsey. : 
Water SuPPLy. 
‘We found the schools, in both suburban and rural sections, 
securing water wheresoever they could get it and of whatever 
character they could find. Very little attention was ‘given to 
the condition of water buckets or to drinking cups. 
We have extended water mains, secured right of way to springs, 
made wells, and introduced in many of the schools the individual 
drinking cups. * 
Pure Ar. 
Teachers and pupils have been given an intelligent idea of 
the value of pure air. The way has been prepared for the in- 
troduction of some modern heating and ventilating systems. 
LIBRARIES. 
‘The nucleus of a library has ‘been placed in every school in 
the county. Not only the pupils, but the patrons have found 
™
-P-A-G-E-486
— 460 — 
the libraries interesting and helpful. The keeping and handling 
of the libraries has not been well systematized. 
IMPROVEMENT LEAGUES. 
Many leagues for the improvement of. schools have been 
organized and these organizations have resulted in much good. 
Some of these organizations have helped to make school condi- 
tions in their respective communities almost ideal. Much re- 
mains to be done in this respect. 
HicH ScHOoL. 
Knox County has two first class high schools, the Central 
High School at Fountain City, and Farragutt High School near 
Concord. At each of these schools we have good, commodious 
brick_ buildings. Each school is well equipped with cheinical 
and physical apparatus, and in each is taught Domestic Science 
and Manual Training. Each school has a splendid water system 
and all modern conveniences. 
In the Central High School there is a Business Department 
in which are taught penmanship, bookkeeping, short hand, 
typewriting and commercial law. ‘The Manual Training Depart- 
ment in this school is equipped with 20 work benches with indi- 
vidual sets of tools, a tool room with general tools, ten iron turning 
lathes of the latest pattern with all necessary tools, combined 
rip and cross saw, band saw and five-horse power motor. 
Agriculture is emphasized at the Farragutt High School. 
There is in connection with this school a farm of twelve acres on 
which crops are grown and experiments are conducted. 
The Farragutt High School stands for a. better agriculture, 
more comfortable farm homes, and the highest: ideals of country 
life. Both the high schools are well attended and the work 
in each is characterized by the highest enthusiasm. 
ATTENDANCE. 
We have an attendance this year of about 13,000 pupils. 
Our experience leads us to believe that if school conditions are 
made inviting the attendance will be good. 
E. R. Carte, 
County Superintendent. sh

LAKE COUNTY. 
I have the honor to submit herewith my annual statistical 
report. Supplementing this report I will add that conditions 
in my county, while not ideal, are about as good as could be 
expected under the circumstances. The County Board system 
has now been in operation for three years with us, and time has 
demonstrated the wisdom of its adoption. Out of chaos order 
has been resolved. The finances and general school adminis- 
tration are on a business basis. School terms have been made 
uniform and the average length of term increased more than 
two years. ‘Rotten boro” schools have been eliminated and 
district lines have been disregarded in locating and consoli- 
dating schools. While school conditions are decidedly better 
they have been brought about by a smaller expenditure of money 
than under the old system. With a few changes the present 
system can be made nearly perfect. 
Owing to the fact that a State Institute was held in the neigh- 
boring town of Dyersburg, no County Institute was held in this 
County. 
R. C. DonaLpson, 
County Superintendent. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
The school year just closed has been one of general satis- 
faction and possibly one of some improvements. The most 
prominent change that has been made during the year is that 
of placing all the schools in the county into one general county 
system. Neither district boundaries nor corporation lines are 
any longer considered. By this we have the same course of 
study, the same plan of grading, and uniformity in promoting, 
thus making it possible for pupils to pass from grade to grade or 
for pupils and teacher to change schools with practically no loss 
to any one. The system shows other advantages also. 
There is now being completed a splendid school building at 
Henning and one at Gates. These will make, in the county, 
five up-to-date brick buildings with all the modern p-ovisions 
for comfort and convenience.

_ Of the seventy-six white teachers in the county, eleven are 
. university graduates, and all the others except nine hold state 
certificates. The least salary paid any of these teachers is $40 
per month; the largest, $200 per month. 
The general interest throughout the county is good, and the 
attendance larger than ever before, though there has. been no 
recent increase in the scholastic population. The consolidated 
schools are doing by far the greater part of the real work; they 
continue to increase in number, to grow in attendance, and to 
ain in popularity. 
gan it Popumy G. G. McLeop, 
County Superintendent. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. ~ 
The institute was well attended, and a better interest has not 
before been shown in Lawrence County. In fact, all the teachers 
claim that this was the best county institute ever held in the 
- county. The teachers of Lawrence County showed a marked 
interest in all the work and especially in primary methods. They 
have awakened to the fact that the “how” is as much necessa- 
ry to know in order to be successful as the ‘‘what.” 
The teachers seem to realize that if they do not prepare them- 
selves better in the profession as professional teachers, that 
they must drop out of the work. 
: They have shown, by their actions, in this institute, that 
they are. willing to sacrifice means if necessary, and devote more 
time to the study of teaching from a systematic standpoint. 
I must say that I am well pleased with the work of the teach- 
ers. Their work marks a great progress in education. : 
We have had a wonderful increase in our libraries. In 1908 
we had 200 libraries, and at the close of this past year, June 30, 
1910, our libraries number 500. © 
Our School Improvement Association has done much in the 
way of beautifying our school grounds and school houses, thus 
making the schools more attractive, resulting in better attendance. 
The increase in our school buildings is very gratifying, it being 
twenty-eight new frame buildings, ranging in value from $500 
to $1,500 each. We have also equipped our school houses with 
patent desks, blackboards, maps, charts, and libraries to the
-P-A-G-E-489
— 463 — 
value of $10,000. While we have not sufficient buildings through- 
out the county, we are putting every effort forth to that end. 
- We feel sure by two more years we will have almost finished 
our school buildings in every part of our county. 
We have one County High School building equipped with 
everything necessary to make the school one of the best in the 
State. We have at present one hundred and thirty-eight pupils 
enrolled in the high school, against ninety-six last year at the 
same time—an increase of forty-two pupils for this term. We 
had six to complete the high school course the last term, ending | 
June.30, 1910. We look with pride to the great work which i is 
being done in the Lawrence County High School. 
Our County Court is awakening to the interest of our public 
schools, and is doing everything in its power to promote the in- 
terest of our schoois. 
i Knowing that the interest of our schools must be aroused 
byjthe teachers, and to a great extent the increase in attendance 
‘depends upon the work of the teacher, we have insisted upon 
the teachers familiarizing themselves with the disadvantages 
in their schools, and to find out why any pupils do not attend 
and remedy such cause if possible. The teachers are working under 
such instructions and working to make the schools more attractive, 
in connection with better qualifying themselves by taking special 
teachers’ training school courses. The teachers have succeeded 
in making a great increase in attendance. / 
The last two years in Lawrence County mark a great improve- 
merit along the educational line.

LEWIS COUNTY. 
Although the limited resources of our county cette ui ‘us to 
practice rigid economy, and we are further embarrassed by‘having . 
a small scholastic population scattered over a rather jarge ter. 
ritory, yet, our schools have made remarkable Progress a 
the past two years. 
The school at Hohenwald was among ‘the. first in the State 
to ask the maximum amount allowed by the State for ‘libraries: 
At present this school has a library of some four or five hundred 
choice books, and as soon as the county is able to provide the 
‘rural districts with good buildings, we will find that those schools _ 
will begin to collect books for the children to read. 
School Improvement Associations have been talked about 
in this county, but have never been successfully organized. An 
effort to get the patrons of each school to fence in the school 
grounds is meeting with success in some communities, and it 
is hoped that the teachers will take hold of the school improve- 
ment associations when they are convinced that their labors 
along this line are backed up by public ‘sentiment, and that — 
all will not be brought to naught by the conduct of unruly boys, 
or by domestic animals. occupying the school house during va- 
cation. | 
In the construction of school houses, it has been the policy 
of the Board of Education to build well, to complete each house 
undertaken, rather than to make small apportionments to all 
of the houses in the county. As can be readily seen, the Board 
will in due time build good houses in all the districts, whereas 
should they undertake the patching-up process, only temporary 
needs would be met, and no permanent good done. You will 
find a photograph of the new building at Napier’ inclosed with 
this report. This building cost $850.00, $400.00 of which was 
‘paid out of the County School fund, and the balance was paid 
by Mr. W. R, Cole, President of the Napier Iron Works. Wherever 
school houses are built in this county, at least half the money 
for building has been raised among the people for whom the 
house was built. 
‘The tax rate for school purposes in this county last year was 
50 ‘cents, and it is the intention of the present Superintendent 
to ask for a ten cent levy for the purpose of seating school houses 
at the next term of the court. If we may judge from the general    
of
-P-A-G-E-492
—— 466 — 
approval that this move has met with so far, the measure will 
pass without opposition. 
Our county has enforced the law that requires an average daily 
attendance of ten pupils, and while this has seemingly worked 
a hardship on some schools, the effect on the whole has been to 
secure better attendance, and to create sentiment for a com- 
pulsory school law, since it makes neighbors dependent on each 
other for the continuance of the school.

LINCOLN COUNTY. 
There were three new school libraries established in Lincoln 
County last year. A county school improvement association 
was organized at the annual institute, and several local associ- 
ations have since been organized from which some beneficial 
results have already been accomplished. : 
There have been eleven new school houses erected during the 
year, which will average $1,000.00 in value, and about one-half 
of the money was raised by the citizens by subscription. The 
County Board bought over $1,000.00 worth of patent desks for 
these new houses, besides blackboards and other fixtures. 
Our County High School has had a very successful year, 
having enrolled 177 pupils, with three teachers, and an equip. 
ment valued at $20,000.00, most of which was donated by citizens. 
Our tax rate is 40 cents for common schools and 5 cents for 
high school. 
J. T. RENNOLDS, 
County Superintendent. 
LOUDON COUNTY. 
The year 1909-10 has been a very successful one so far as the 
schools of Loudon County are concerned. 
The enrollment has been much larger, the average attendance 
much greater, and the work done of a far superior kind. 
These things can be accounted for, partly because of the fact 
that we had compulsory attendance, and partly because ‘our

The education spirit is gradually taking hold of all our people. 
Allare becoming interested, and in the outlying nooks of our county

there is a demand for better school houses, better teachers, and 
longer school terms. 
These are favorable signs, and ought to be heeded by the 
powers that be. 
There are now several first class school houses in our county, 
but there are still many that area disgrace to the 20th century, to 
Tennessee, and to Loudon County. I am opposed to arson in 
every shape and form, but if a “blast from heaven” should re- 
move some of these houses out of Loudon County, I would shed 
no tears, but would rather feel inclined to say, ‘Praise God from 
whom all blessings flow.” If this be treason make the most of it: 
This was the first year of the compulsory law and it worked 
well. We were greatly handicapped by lack of accommodation, 
but it placed many in the school that would never have been 
there. 
It is a good and a beneficial law. 
« he educational rally, instituted during the administration 
of Superintendent Mynders, and continued during that of Super- 
intendent Jones, has done incalculable good. It has had a uni- 
fying influence. It has enthused the entire body of the -people. 
It has given them right ideas of education. It has educated 
them and brought them to see that the future of the State, the 
success of the State, the salvation of the State, depends upon 
an educated childhood. 
Let the good work go on. Let the Educational Rally become 
an annual State, an annual county institution. 
The County High School came late, but it is here, andy we re- 
joice. It still has its opponents among those who are not familiar 
with educational subjects, and who are not in sympathy with 
‘twentieth century progress, but their number is becoming smaller 
and smaller, as the darkness is dispelled by the light. Heaven 
hasten the time when the 15th century shall have no representa- 
tive in the twentieth, especially. on the public boards of our 
counties! : 
The establishment of the State normals will fill our cup of 
rejoicing. It is the climax of great events in Tennessee. We 
now see the beginning of the consummation. 
With first class school houses, every child in school at least 
nine months a year, taught by a first class, normal trained teacher, 
and an excellent County High School within reach of every child

in every county in Tennessee, surely the millenninm, wail: have 
dawned. 
Anyhow, and without any fears of contradiction; “Leiidon 
County has started towards it, and she is not going ‘to stop ‘until 
she reaches it. : 
We congratulate you, Superintendent Jones, 0 on tte c spend 
sticcess of your administration. oo 
  CoLORED SCHOOLS. 
This year I do what I have never done before. f send youa 
separate report of the colored schools, and I do this because of 
the fact that I believe, that in 1909 and 1910, the colored schools 
of Loudon County made a splendid record, and one that will 
be hard to beat. / : 
In two districts, with a scholastic colored population of 
225, the enrollment was equal to the population and the average 
attendance was 85 per cent of the enrollment. Had I desired 
to prosecute because of non-attendance there was no one to 
prosecute. : 
I attribute this state of affairs entifely to the work of the 
two principals of these districts, Rev. W. R. Stephens and W. D. 
Edington. 
_In the other districts, also, the enrollment and attendance 
were excellent. About 90 per cent of the colored scholastic 
population were enrolled, and of the enrollment over 80 per cent 
were in daily attendance. 
‘Two of our colored teachers opened night schools for the older 
people, with the result that there are now in our county’a consid- 
erable number of colored men and women who can read their 
Bibles, who, a year ago, could not do so. They taught: these 
night schools ‘free gratis and for nothing.”’ . 
They also produced a regular cleaning up among the negroes 
of persons, children, homes and: yards. All in all the colored 
schools and the colored people made splendid progress, and I 
thought it was only giving them and their teachers a ‘‘fair deal” 
to note the fact. : 
Besides, Superintendent Jones, I think it is something to the 
eredit of Loudon County, and not only so but it seems to me it 
is something to the credit of your administration. 
I hope, sir, you will find room for this special report in your 
annual report.

MACON COUNTY. 
Within the last two years there has been an increased interest 
in public education in Macon County. This was caused by an 
increase in the salary of teachers, the erecting of new school build- 
ings, and better qualified teachers. 
The County Board of Education and general public are to be 
congratulated upon the great work accomplished. 
With the aid and attention given us by the State, together 
with local reform, Macon County has made greater progress in 
educational interest within the last two years than in any other 
period of her history. 
On account of various diseases being prevalent in our county 
last year, we had only one teacher’s meeting, but this year, in- 
cluding the educational rally ordered by Superintendent R. L. 
Jones, we have had four and much good results from the same. 
- For the last two years we have erected nine new school houses, 
enlarged one, and repaired many, bought the college building 
and land at Red Boiling Springs and bought 500 double school 
desks. 
We are still in need of more new buildings, and desks, but- 
will be compelled to wait a while longer on account of money. 
We need more school funds to pay better salaries, hence 
secure better teachers, and run longer terms.
-P-A-G-E-498
— 472 — 
In erecting the nine school houses we have made three con- 
solidations, hence eliminated three schools. 
We held four days in institute work this year, and examined 
on one subject each day, therefore held a better daily attendance 
- of teachers. 
The institute was the most interesting one of our history. 
The roll of attendance were all teachers. Of course, we had a 
good audience besides our teachers, but I did not enroll any but 
teachers. _ 
The teachers adopted a resolution to have a tri-county in- 
stitute next year, composed of the three counties of Macon, 
Trousdale and Sumner. 
The teachers.and patrons are better satisfied with the county 
Board system than at first. For the last two years the schools 
except two, have run the same number of days. This has never 
been done before. 
There is now a greater effort on the part of the teacher to make 
himself better qualified for his work than ever. before. 
There has been a movement made to organize School Improve- 
ment Associations and establish libraries. 
The people are more interested in education than ever before.

We have five libraries in the county, but have not received 
any county or State aid along that line. 
The county has made wonderful improvement the past two 
years in buildings and equipments, so much so that the school 
term this year was shortened, the money being used for buildings, 
etc. : 
We have a County High School, with two consolidated schools, 
in which high school pupils are taught. They are also taught 
in the two city schools. 
Our county levied last year a High School tax.of 12 cents, 
for common schools 32 cents, and poll $2.00, State and county.

County Superintendent. 
McNAIRY COUNTY. 
In connection with my statistical report, 1 herewith submit 
a brief report of the work accomplished in McNairy County. 
I am sorry to report that we have not done much in the way 
of establishing school libraries, but a great many of the teachers 
are interested on the subject, and I am sure several libraries will 
be put in this year. 
We have a County Improvement Association, and it has ac- 
complished splendid results. Many plans have been announced 
for the year. Already the appearance of the grounds and the 
houses shows the wisdom of establishing the association. 
Within the last four years about thirty-five school houses 
have been erected at a cost of about $20,000. Almost as.many 
have been repaired and made comfortable. Over $2,000 have 
been spent for patent seats, and more will be spent this year. 
It is our aim to have a white school house and modern equip- 
ment in every district within the next two years. 
A County High School has been established, and has been 
in session since September. It is located at Selmer, the county 
seat. By a special town tax of twenty-five cents, and the funds 
derived from State and county sources, we are enabled to employ 
four teachers, and run eight months. The school is free for all 
the grades, beginning in the primary department, to any person’ 
of school age in the county. 
The attendance of the schools is not what it should be, being 
about, on enrollment, 80 per cent of the scholastic population, 
and on average, daily attendance about 60 per cent. We have 
no local compulsory law. 
I have made a thorough canvass of the county, holding about 
twenty-five rallies. At these meetings I addressed ‘thousands 
of people. I was aided in the work by local outside help. I 
am sure these rallies will bear fruit.
-P-A-G-E-502
—— 476. — 
Our term is five months. We have increased this in nearly 
all the districts one week, by offering an additional week where 
the wood was furnished without cost to the county. Under this 
plan, $1,000 is saved on our wood bill. 
I have devised a weekly report blank, and believe that it 
has been the means of stimulating the teachers, besides it en-" 
ables me to keep in closer touch with them. ‘The report’is as 
follows:

In conclusion, on behalf of my county, I desire to thank pro- 
foundly our worthy State Superintendent for the interest he 
has shown in our welfare. ‘The two State institutes held here, 
our County High School, our Teachers’ Association, our Improve- 
ment Association, and our extended school term, were made 
‘ possible by the policies he outlined, and for which he has given 
four years of unselfish service.

" MARION COUNTY. 
I am submitting herein a report of matters pertaining to the - 
growth, or development of. the public school work in Marion 
County; being evidences of an improvement with reference to 
which the figures of an annual report are silent. 
As yet, there have been no school libraries placed in the county. 
However, there are at present two schools in the county actively 
engaged in raising funds with which to place a library in their 
schools, and they expect to accomplish this before the expiration 
of the present school term. In these two schools the work is 
being undertaken by the School Improvement Associations, and 
their work in this direction has been delayed on account of the 
associations first giving attention to the improvement of the 
buildings and grounds. ‘There are a number of other schools of 
the county which have signified their intention of securing a 
library as soon as they have finished needed improvements in 
the condition of their buildings and grounds. 
As to the School Improvement Associations, there are fifteen 
working organizations in the county, but every school in the 
county has felt the uplift of the movement, and whether with, or 
without organized effort, every school is doing school .improve-
-P-A-G-E-504
— 478 — 
tment work. A large number of teachers report that local ‘con- 
ditions are such that it is practically impossible, at present, to 
maintain an organization of this character. The attention of 
the teachers to the need of this work is insisted upon by the 
Board of Education, and the appearance and healthfulness of 
the school buildings in the county have been wonderfully: én- 
hanced by the new interest aroused in these matters by this 
movement. 
One new brick building costing, $12,000.00 has been erected 
in the county, and three new frame buildings have been con- 
structed, and one old brick building has been thoroughly over- 
hauled and stuccoed. All buildings have been erected by aid 
of private subscription, the new brick building having in it — 
$6,000.00 donated by local parties, and local aid was extended 
in the erection of the other buildings. We have now under way 
two new frame buildings, one-third of the cost of which will be 
met by private subscription. The people have had preached 
to them the necessity of good buildings, and the poverty of the 
School Board, until they are ready to aid us in putting up build- 
ings, and those communities offering us such aid received first 
attention. . 
Marion County has within the past year established one 
High School, to support which the County Court has levied 
a tax of 15 cents. The High School Board has acquired the 
Pryor Institute school property from the Methodist Church for 
$6,500.00. This property is worth $35,000.00, and we think 
that there is no better high school property outside the larger 
counties, in the State of Tennessee. It is located at the county 
seat in the center of population of the county. 
At the same term which established the County High School, 
the court increased the levy for the benefit of the elementary 
schools from 40 to 50 cents on the $100. ‘The Court seems to 
be in the mood to take care of the financial interest of the schools, ° 
and their improvement seems to be up to the school officials. 
We have a compulsory attendance law which does not have 
the desired effect. The trouble seems to lie in the tendency of 
the trial courts to excuse these offences, and the success of the 
lawyers for the defense in impressing upon the court the in- 
sufficiency of the records in the County Superintendents’ office 
as proof to sustain a conviction. It seems the Act should specifi-
-P-A-G-E-505
— 479 — 
cally provide that these records be sufficient proof for this purpose, 
unless overcome. 
All the schools of the county have been graded according to 
the course of study adopted by the State Superintendent.

MARSHALL COUNTY. 
In submitting my annual report I feel that much might be | 
said concerning the progress we have made along educational 
lines during the past year. We have consolidated a: number 
of schools; improved many buildings; raised the standard of 
efficiency of our teachers, and are having a seven months’ school 
term. 
While we have no - county high schools we have the advan- 
tages of several training schools, which rank with the leading 
training or preparatory schools of the State. 
Every teacher in the county reads one or more educational 
journals, and is studying the books adopted by the State’ Read- 
ing Circle Committee. 
Our people are for no backward step along educational lines, 
and we trust that we shall continue to have their hearty co-oper- 
ation, and that our efforts will be crowned with achievements 
far greater than we have been able to accomplish for the better- 
ment of the condition of our public schools. 
J. G. Stinson,

MAURY COUNTY. 
Since the enactment of the law giving State Aid to help es- 
tablish public school libraries, eighteen schools have met the 
conditions laid down in the law and now have publi¢ school li-
-P-A-G-E-507

braries. In addition four schools have supplemented their libra- 
ries by meeting the conditions in the law. Other schools have 
part of their money raised and wifl secure libraries before. the 
close of the year. 
' ScHooL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION. i 
We have a county organization composed of thirty teachers. 
Several schools in the county have local organizations,, One 
half hour at the beginning of each monthly Teachers’ Meeting is 
given to the school improvement work. The reports of what lias, 
been done during the month by the schools have been very stim- 
ulating to all the teachers, non-members as well as members. 
Our libraries and several other improvements are largely due to 
the influence of the School Improvement Association. 
INCREASE IN Materia, EQuipMEnT. 
The County Board of Education has spent more than five 
thousand dollars during the past year in building mew houses, 
buying desks and school apparatus. Sometimes the Board pays 
for all the improvements, but frequently the communities pay for _ ° 
part. 
HicH ScHOOLS. 
We have one County and City High School combined enter- 
ing upon its second year as a combined school. This school has 
a faculty of five teachers and more than two hundred pupils. It 
is doing the work of.a first class high school in the English, Science, 
and Latin Courses. The school is fast gaining in popularity 
with the people of the county. The schdol is in need of an up- 
to-date building and equipment. This will come by and by 
when more of the people learn to appreciate what the. school 
means for the masses. : 
TAXATION, 
Our county this year levied a sixteen-cent tax for common’ 
school purposes which is ati increase of four cents. It levied 
a three-cent tax for high school purposes, the first tax: ever levied 
in this county for such purpose. In addition the county levies 
a poll tax of one dollar and a privilege tax of fifteen cents. 
ATTENDANCE. 
My last report shows an increased enrollinent over the pre-
-P-A-G-E-508
— 482 — 
ceding year of 359, also an increase in the average daily attend- 
ance of 424. 
The attendance was the largest at a county summer institute 
‘ within the memory of the teachers present. ‘There was a large 
number of young teachers most of whom had finished a Train- 
ing School Course or had graduated from the county high school. 
The outlook for a strong corps of teachers from this source is 
bright. There was less noise and more hard work and genuine 
school interest in the work this year than formerly. Every 
subject had its hour and instructor, and nothing was allowed to 
inteffere with the well planned program.

also provided three houses with desks. Some small additions 
“have been made to two libraries for public schools, also a few 
dollars have been subscribed to start a teachers’ library. :

‘The most important thing done for education in the county. 
was the raise of the High School fund from five to fifteen cents 
on the $100. 
While our scholastic enumeration was 64 fewer than the pre- 
vious year, the enrollment was 20 fewer, but the average daily 
attendance was 50 greater, thus raising the per cenit7of attendance 
three and two-tenths per cent. 
At that rate of increase we shall have perfect attendari¢e in 
thirteen years. Sawada!

MONROE COUNTY. 
Not much has been done in our county along the line of li- 
brary work. The question was discussed and some enthusiasm 
aroused and a number of teachers have begun to raise funds for 
a library. Our teachers have a very nice professional library 
to which they contributed about $45.00 last year, and they pro- 
pose to add to it from time to time. : / : 
A number of our teachers do their very best to improve their 
school houses and grounds. Last year one young Jady bought 
paint and painted the inside of her school house with the aid 
of her pupils. When I visited the school rooms I found it one of 
the most beautiful school rooms that I was ever in. I called the 
attention of the Board of Education to the matter and they 
very readily paid for the paint. About half of our teachers ob- 
serve Arbor Day, set trees, clean up the premises, burn brush and 
decorate the house in various ways. One young lady is now 
raising money to buy an organ for her school. 
During the summer we bought about $1,200 worth of desks 
for our country schools, built six new houses and repaired eight. 
In building new houses we observe the suggestions of the State 
Superintendent in regard to light, heat and ventilation. We 
have some real nice new school buildings. 
The Monroe County High School has entered upon its third 
year’s work, and is moving along with all the grace of an old-time 
institution. Last year we had one graduate; this year there is 
quite a Jarge senior class. During the past year we built and 
equipped a girls’ boarding hall at a cost of $6,000, and we mean 
to add other buildings as time and. means will permit. 
There is not now any material objection to our tax rate. We
-P-A-G-E-512
— 486 — 
collect a 40 per cent property tax for common schools, 7 cents 
for High School and polls and privileges as required by law. 
The compulsory school law increased our enrollment about 
500 for the county. During the fifty days of the application of 
“the law the attendance was fine, after that time it dropped back 
to the usual conditions. One party who was fined last year for 
not sending, sold out and moved into another county where the 
law does not apply. Another party was so anxious to send this 
year that he sent to another school till his school commenced. 
I think our county is making reasonably good advancement 
along educational lines. ° .

MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
This has been altogether a reasonably satisfactory year along 
some lines. Our work for libraries does not show up so well, 
but we have reasons for this. Our school houses are usually 
left open, or broken open during the summer months, and our — 
work this year has been to create a sentiment against this abuse 
of school property. We have made very good progress, and this 
advance is due the energy and earnestness displayed by members. 
of the Improvement Associations. We spent more than $3,000, 
building and repairing school houses; $1,300 for furniture. We' 
have a High School tax of 10 cents on the hundred dollars, and 
a well equipped school is running in Clarksville, which will have 
an income of nearly $9,000 per year. This should secure for us 
a good school. : : 
The taxation for other schools remains the same; 40 cents 
on the hundred dollars, and two dollar poll and 40 cents privileges. 
The attendance is still a problem with us. Yet with an en- 
rollment of fewer pupils than the year before, our daily attend- 
ance was 260 more than that year. We had no Institute, as one 
was held in an adjoining county, which was attended by some 
of our teachers. Our county meetings were better attended 
than ever before, and the State reading course was studied and 
discussed by competent instructors from among the teachers.
-P-A-G-E-514

We expect to have better things to report for the present 
school year, for already some unprecedented work has been done. 
J. G. RoLtow, 
County Superintendent. 
MOORE COUNTY. 
Two libraries have been established in my county under the 
library law, one last year, and one this year. I hope the time is 
near when all schools will provide for a library. 
At our annual institute we organized a County School Im- 
provement Association, and a few teachers have organized local 
associations.. We have accomplished a few things along this 
line, as clearing the rubbish from the school grounds, scrubbing 
the floors, walls, etc., and procuring pictures for the walls, white 
linen covers for the teachers’ table, and flowers for the same; 
growing plants for the windows, and awnings for the same, to 
keep out the morning or evening sun when falling upon the stu- 
dents’ desks. 
Waste baskets for refuse paper; dustless crayon for the com- 
mon, inferior crayon generally used; better lamps for lighting 
the building, repair buildings or supply furniture, and to secure 
libraries. The teachers seem to be taking interest in this work, 
considering we have had no organizer or lecturer to assist or en- 
courage us. 
We are hoping Miss Moore can pay us a visit next year at our 
annual institute. 
We have no County High School. However, we are sadly 
in need of one. The teachers are generally educated in the 
county, and some do not go higher than the procuring of a teach- 
er’s primary certificate, but every teacher should possess at 
least a high school education; the county owes its teachers this 
much. 
We pay a tax of 40 cents, but this is not sufficient. We 
should increase the tax for the common school at least 10 cents, 
to get longer terms, and levy a 10 cents tax for county high 
school purposes. 
We need a mild compulsory school law and its enforcement. 
Some children of school age do not enter school at all. Money

Cora Wiseman, Conductor, was assisted by Prof. F. M. Bow: 
ling, of Murfreesboro, who was sent here by our kind State Super- 
intendent R. L. Jones. The institute was well attended each 
day, considering we lost some of our teachers, who attended the 
State Institute at Fayetteville, or the Summer School at Knox- 
ville. _ Instructors: Cora Wiseman, Reading; Jas. M. Bick-

MORGAN COUNTY. 
The Institute which began June 6, 1910, and closed June 17, 
1910, is considered the best ever held in Morgan County. 
We employed six instructors and divided the work into de- 
partments which proved much more interesting than former 
methods. We devoted the last three days to written examina- 
tions, which were very thorough, and as a result 20 per cent of 
our applicants failed to secure passing grades, but this secured 
for our schools only those teachers who were entirely fortified to 
give good instruction. 
The Compulsory School Law is working like a charm, and our 
schools are doing better work than ever. Our great need now is 
more money in order that the boys and girls may have better 
school houses, more comfortable furniture, better paid teachers 
and longer term of schools.

OBION COUNTY. 
The schools of Obion County show an improvement over last 
year in some particulars; in others there is a loss. The popu- 
lation is not so much, but this is due to the close scrutiny now 
given to the population schedules to prevent double listing. 
We have established eight libraries under the new law, repre- 
senting an expenditure of $240.00, and 588 books. Obion County 
has the honor of making the first requisition for money under this 
-new law. Miss Sudie Caruthers gave an ice cream supper and 
raised the neat sum of $42.50 for this purpose. Since June 30, 
of this year we have purchased three more libraries, representing 
$75.00, and 157 books. More libraries will be established this 
year. : 
Miss Virginia P. Moore organized the county into a School 
Improvement Association at our County Institute, but not much 
‘work has been done, I am sorry to say. A few schools have or- 
ganized. There are a great many of the schools doing improve- 
ment work, but not under the auspices of the association. 
‘The increase in equipment is about $16,000 for the county, 
and $4,000 for the city. There has been one new house erected 
and several remodeled. 
We have no County High School, but hope to have some day 
in the near future. 
Obion County levies a tax of 45 cents, including the State 
tax for schools; besides this the town of Obion levies a special 
tax of 50 cents, and Union City 30 cents. 
The attendance problem is a problem in this county, as there 
is no compulsory law applying to this county. The boys are

kept at home to do the farm labor, and this is done’so much in 
some sections of the county where cotton is grown that the schools, 
are suspended for four or six weeks.

  The work this year seemed good. The teachers were very 
much interested. I wish to make special mention of a talk given 
by Superintendent A. C. Nute, of Union City, and the work of 
Miss Virginia P. Moore. Miss Moore organized the county into 
a School Improvement Association, and we expect much from 
this department. The'work of Miss Josephine Tardiff, in Primary 
Methods, was one of the best features of the institute. Miss 
Tardiff was with us last year, and I have had occasion to note 
the efforts of her work in the schools the past year. It has 
borne fruit. © 
The attendaice at the County Institute must not be con- 
sidered as all the attendance at institutes. Obion County had 
18 or 20, at Dyersburg, a large number at Paris, and 14 at the 
Summer School of the South at Knoxville. The last is very en- 
couraging. I hope to see more next year. oe

PERRY COUNTY. 
It can safely be said that our schools are improving. The 
thoughtful people realize the fact that our future citizenship 
demands an education for our boys and girls. 
Lack of money causes. our schools and buildings to be not 
what we desire, but the people are discussing plans of securing 
more money by taxation. There is at present a tax of 25 cents 
on $100, and our County Court has raised the salary of Super- 
intendent, that the county may receive aid from the State, and 
procure his entire time. 
We have no libraries or high school, but some of our schools 
are striving for libraries, and a good per cent of our citizens are 
in favor of high schools. 
The Superintendent, assisted by J. W. Seaton, conducted a 
four weeks’ Normal, for benefit of teachers, which was attended 
by almost all who expected to teach. . . 
‘The teachers are working, and express a strong desire to be- 
come more efficient.

PICKETT COUNTY.. 
There have been no radical changes effected in the school 
system of Pickett County during the two years past. Perhaps 
there has been a slow advancement, but it is too slow to be marked. 
No school libraries have as yet been established, but it is 
hoped that some may be established during the coming year; 
We have no county high school, but our people are becoming 
interested to some extent along that line. It is hoped that our 
condition may be such that we may have one or more such schools 
in the near future. : 
We have built one new house this year and one last year, 
and will continue to build one new house each year until we 
have good houses in each district. 
We held two very interesting Teachers’ Institutes this year, 
they were well attended by the teachers and the general public. 
Last year we held four meetings, but they were not so well at- 
tended as the two we had this year. One great drawback to our 
system is a lack of experienced teachers; this, of course, can not 
be helped until we have more money. About one third of our 
teachers are new each year, and this will ever be the same, so 
long as we have so little money to expend on schools. Teachers 
as soon as they have gained some knowledge and a little expe- 
rience will look for more remunerative employment than is of- 
fered in our schools. 
The attendance has been a little better that usual the past 
two years, but still falls far short of what it should be.

‘PUTNAM COUNTY. 
Our County Institute for white teachers, which was held in 
the public school building in Cookeville, from June 20 to 25, was 
probably the best in the history of the county. 
The colored teachers had an interesting and successful in- 
stitute. Their institute was conducted at the same time as the 
institute for white teachers, but in the colored public school 
building. Their instructors did very creditable work.
-P-A-G-E-527

We hold monthly teachers’ institutes and educational rallies 
at different points throughout the county, while the schools are 
in session. These meetings have been a wonderful stimulus to 
the educational interests of the county. 
I have endeavored incessantly for eight years to thoroughly 
grade the schools of the county, and the good results of grading 
the schools are now very manifest. Practically all of the teach- 
ers of the county adhere strictly to the grade schedule and course 
of study. 
Every teacher in the county reads one or more educational 
journals, and all are studying the books adopted by the State 
Reading Circle Committee. | 
The people of Putnam County, asa rule, are thoroughly in- 
terested in the cause of public education, and each year marks - 
an improvement in the educational conditions of the county. 
The personnel and qualifications of the teaching force of the 
county upon the whole, grows better each year. ‘ 
The public schools of Putnam County have, no doubt, made 
as marked progress during the past two years as has been made 
in any other county in the State.

RHEA COUNTY. 
. During the biennial period, designated in your recent com- 
munication, ending June 30, 1910, the following facilities for 
education have obtained in Rhea County. Forty-six common 
schools, primary and secondary, located in various parts of the 
county; one High School located in Dayton, with a four ‘years’ 
course, called ‘The Rhea County High School;” two city schools— 
one for white and one for colored pupils—located in Dayton, 
the course of study including eight grades; one church school 
located in Graysville, called ‘“‘The Southern Ttaining School;” 
one church school located at Grandview, known as Grandview 
Normal. In addition to these schools occasional Private schools 
are taught. 
During these two years pupils from this county have attended 
Peabody Normal, Vanderbilt University, Bible School, Ward 
Seminary, and other Nashville schools. Some have attended 
Emory and Henry College, Martha Washington College of Vir- 
ginia, some have attended schools in North Carolina, Keritucky 
and Georgia. University of Tennessee has had her share of 
those patronizing schools beyond county limits, seeking pro- 
fessional and other higher education. 
‘The teachers for the white schools have been meeting in month- 
ly session during these two years, with a per cent of attendance 
of about 99. It is out of the ordinary when more than one 
teacher is absent from institute sessions. 
The colored teachers are attentive on their monthly institute 
‘work this year. :
-P-A-G-E-530
— 504 — 
As there were so few of them, they did not organize last year. 
They held, however, two weeks’ summer institutes during period. 
The first summer normal of the period for whites was of two 
weeks’ duration, county, with State aid; the second was of four 
weeks’ duration, State with county aid. 
The Board of Education makes it a sina qua non that teach- 
ers shall attend these summer Normals, or sutmmer school of 
the South at Knoxville, or summer schoo! at Peabody Normal, 
Nashville, or schools where similar work is done. 
The school terms for the period has been six months per 
year. It is the intention of the Board of Education to lengthen 
present school year-to seven months. 
The School Board in the recent past, not having heard the 
laconic expression you are wont to use, ‘Don’t Put Your School 
Money in Bricks and Mortar,” but by bond issue, or some other 
way, provide money for the erection of your school houses, put 
more money in the school buildings than the funds at their com- 
mand would allow without shortening the terms of schools. 
The length of term of Rhea County High School has been 
eight and nine months respectively the last two years. 
The number of graduates, year ending June 30, 1909, 13; June 
30, 1910, 20. 
Many of the High School graduates are teaching in the county. 
Others go to school elsewhere; as, University of Tennessee, Mary~- 
ville College, Emory and Henry College, Martha’ Washington 
College, and other schools. 
The enrollment by branches of study last year will indicate 
the kind of work that is being done in the High School. Spelling,

ROANE COUNTY. 
Without question the schools of Roane County are progressing. 
‘The progress is a gradual, healthy growth in efficiency. It mani- 
fests itself in better qualifications of teachers, better grading of 
schools, better attendance, and to some extent better equipments. 
As a rule our teachers have been studying either at home or 
by attending high school during the winter. Our examinations 
have been practical, but a little more rigid each succeeding year. 
Papers have been graded for, just what they were worth, no more, 
no less. Salaries have gradually advanced, so that we are ap- 
proaching the point where the best. teachers can be kept in the 
work. without hunting more lucrative fields. However, the ad- 
vance in salaries and the cost of new buildings and desks have 
prevented an increase in the length of our terms. For the past 
two years and the present year our terms have been and are 
uniformly only five months. We need more money. 
It has been difficult in many cases to get our teachers of pri- 
mary schools out of the old five grade system into the eight grade 
system, but we hope to have every school this year properly 
graded. 
Two things have contributed to a better attendance of pupils. 
First, the general awakening of most parents to the importance 
of a better education. Second, the enforcement of our county 
compulsory law. It is gratifying to know that very few of our 
people oppose this law. We often hear men and women of twenty 
to thirty years of age say, “I wish this law had been enacted 
many years ago; it would have been better for me.” This law 
has been in force only a year, but already it has done its part 
toward increasing the per cent of children in the county who can 
read and write. 
Perhaps a mistake has been made by our County Board in 
yielding to the importunities of citizens in certain districts more 
than two and a half miles froma school building. A few schools 
have been established and some houses erected where it would 
be better to assist them in some way, if it could be done lawfully, 
in attending the schools already established. We need consoli- 
dations rather than multiplication. 
Our four weeks’ summer institutes have been for several 
years growing ‘more interesting and profitable. This year it
-P-A-G-E-532
— 506° — 
was universally conceded that we had the best in our history, 
although compelled to rely upon our best local teachers for in- 
- structors. They were very practical and almost to a unit the 
teachers were real students during the whole term. We had 
several eminent visitors from outside our county who pronounced 
ours the best institute they had visited. 
We have but four public school libraries, one in each of our 
two county high schools, one in the Harriman city schools, and 
a juvenile library of over a hundred volumes at the County Su- 
perintendent’s office for loaning to the rural schools. These 
four libraries aggregate approximately one thosuand volumes. 
There has also been established recently a Carnegie Library in 
Harriman, which promises much good to that city. Funds were 
raised to start a library at one of our rural schools, but owing to 
the accidental burning of the school building it was temporarily 
abandoned. 
We have no School Improvement Association. I regard this 
as one of the most important organizations for school advance- 
ment, but it is perhaps one of the most difficult to start. 
During the last two scholastic years, ending June 30, 1910, 
we erected six new school buildings, one of which was a two- 
room building, modeled after the plans sent out by. the State 
Superintendent, and costing nearly two thousand dollars. 
Since June 30 we have erected four other new buildings. The 
cost of these buildings approximated $6,000. During the time 
mentioned about $2,500 has been expended for new patent 
desks and other furnishings. 
Our two county high schools are well patronized and doing 
good work. There are now in attendance about. seventy-five 
strictly high school pupils. After the holidays, when the rural 
schools have closed, the high school patronage will increase 
fifty to seventy-five per cent, as many of the higher grade pupils 
are now attending their home schools, and many of the teachers 
themselves will then resume their studies in the high schools. 
About sixty per cent of our white teachers have been patrons—- 
some of them graduates—of our county high schools. Both 
schools are graded as first class... The one at Kingston, one of the 
oldest in the State, has recently added several subjects to its 
curriculum. During the present year it will enjoy the highest 
patronage of its history. The other is located at Wheat in a
-P-A-G-E-533
— 507 — 
wealthy rural settlement. It is now in its third year. It sup- 
planted Roane College, which had existed there for thirty odd 
years. It also has a healthy growth. These high schools are: 
chiefly supported by a local tax of.8 cents per $100 ‘on ‘a proper 
value of nearly five million. The tax rate for our rural schools 
is much too low, as our county schools run only five months,” 
Our local compulsory law has had one year’s test. It applies CES 
to children from eight to sixteen years, four months a year. — 
It has increased the attendance about fifteen per.cent, and.con- 
sequently, the per cent of children who can read and write from 
about 70 to 80 per cent; all this in only one year. Comparatively.” : 
few of the parents oppose the law, though a few prosecutiens for ©. 
violating the law had to be made. To make the greatest success, .. 
all violators should be prosecuted by the sheriffs or constables 
immediately on being notified of the offence by the Secretary of 
the County Board, as provided for by the law. But ‘the officers 
were loth to be the prosecutors. Hence, prosecutions had to be 
postponed till end of term and then made, as provided further 
- by the law, by the County Board. I do not believe that a ma- 
jority of the parents would be willing to return to the non-com- 
pulsory system. : :

ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
For the past four years I have studied the educational prob- 
lems and interests of my people from the standpoint of an official. 
For eight years previous to this time I studied these conditions 
from the standpoint of a teacher in the ranks. In both posi- 
tions I have been able to detect weaknesses of our system—a 
lack of well equipped, professionally trained, and skilled teachers; 
public sentiment; comfortable, attractive, and conveniently
-P-A-G-E-535
— 509 — 
arranged buildings, and last but not least, a more effective system 
of school business—and by untiring industry, and through the 
hearty co-operation of my teachers to strengthen these weak- 
nesses we are glad to give you the facts below which speak for 
themselves. 
Houses AND GROUNDS. 
Four years ago the total estimated value of all school property 
including houses, grounds, furniture and fixtures, and all improve- 
ments was not over $35,000, and of the 108 buildings for white 
and colored children there were not over twenty comfortable 
and well arranged buildings in the county. Practically. 80 per 
cent of the buildings were defective either in heating and lighting, 
or comfort and convenience. Many of them were unpainted, 
furnished with rude furniture, and the ground upon which they 
were built was not properly deeded. 
Today our school property is conservatively estimated at 
$52,000. Many of the old, unsightly, poorly furnished buildings 
have been torn away and new ones, more attractive, better 
furnished—and in arrangement health and comfort have been 
considered—have been erected in their places. ‘The old dusty 
blackboard that was found in atmost every school building in the 
county has been removed and in its stead a good talc board 
has been placed. In 1906 the County paid $555.51 for furniture, 
fixtures and apparatus. Each year since that date an average 
of more than $1,000 has been expended for this purpose. During 
the scholastic year ending June 30, 1910, more than $3,500 was 
expended in new buildings which represented only one-half the 
total amount or cost of buildings. Many of our old buildings 
have been painted and repainted and remodeled. During the 
last three months three new frame buildings for the colored children 
have been built, and three additions to one-room school buildings 
for white children have been made and two teachers are employed 
where only one was formerly necessary. , 
This movement to improve our buildings has only begun. 
And, too, our people are not content now with just an ordinary 
little frame box with a window on each side, one door in the end 
and a big stove in the middle of the room, but a later model 
must be used or none.
-P-A-G-E-536

-LIBRARIES. 
Until last year there was not a single library in any of the 
colored schools. A teachers’ library consisting of about two 
hundred volumes was kept in the Superintendent’s office. From 
this library and through the effort of the Superintendent to get 
more literature and better literature into the hands of the boys 
and girls of the county a movement, having its beginning prior 
to the enactment of the present library measure, was started. 
This movement has borne fruit. We took this matter up with 
our most progressive teachers with the result that a number was 
readily established. ‘This result gave others the inspiration to 
try, and at the end of the scholastic year 1908-1909 twenty-four 
rural school libraries were established. Since this five more have 
been established, making in all twenty-nine public school libraries 
_ in the Robertson County schools. We are figuring on establishing 
eleven more before the present scholastic year ends, which will 
give us libraries in 50 per cent of our white schools. 
But merely establishing these libraries is not the goal of our 
ambition. We take special pains to see that these books are 
. properly used, and as a result we have a better sentiment for all 
school enterprises. The patrons’ are even reading these books 
with delight and are reporting favorably of the progress made 
by their children. Next to the teacher, we consider the library 
one of the strongest factors in the public school work. 
TAXATION. 
The school tax has been raised from 20 cents on the htindred 
dollars to 30 cents. This has materially increased our facilities. 
Our policy has been never to ask the court to raise the levy until 
it is satisfied that the amount already levied and expended was 
done judiciously and effectively. And we have never asked for a 
raise that it was not granted. 
SALARIES OF THACHERS. 
The teachers of my county were paid, formerly, ‘a uniform 
salary regardless of scholarship, experience, good or bad, pro- 
fessional training, or grade of school. ‘The average salary under . 
the director system during its last days of existence was about 
$37 per month, and the average term was 100 days. Under 
the County Board system our teachers are paid on a basis of
-P-A-G-E-537
  — 511 — 
scholarship, experience, skill, etc., or rather a scale i is. s made out 
whereby a teacher may be able to get recognition for’ 
and the progress she makes. This year the average 
our teachers per month is $47.75 and an average term of 120-days.. 
    State READING CiRCLE COURSE. 
    My teachers are encouraged to take up this course as eatly. 
as it is adopted and begin the study at once. And in order to 
  get every teacher to try and study the course thé-Board of Educa- » 
tion usually makes a proposition to the teachers who will begin : 
the reading early in the fall of the year.’ The Board will furnish. - : 
the course at 50 per cent of the actual cost to every teacher” 
who will get the course by a certain fixed date. -This has been: 
the means of getting all of our teachers to study the course and 
at the same time to get the practical value of the work. 
County THaCHERS’ ASSOCIATION. * - 
We have a County Teachers’ Association which meets once 
amonth. ‘This association has been the means of bringing about 
much interest and effective school work. The motto of the 1910 
association is: Better schools, and better roads. Both phases 
of this subject are discussed at each meeting and we are now get~ 
ting results in the school work and a sentiment for better roads. 
The united effort of the teachers of atry county can, when they 
are in the right, accomplish any undertaking. We are going 
to have better roads and better schools, too. 
SUMMER INSTITUTE. 
A detailed report of the Robertson County Summer Institute, 
which was held in Springfield in June, 1910, was filed with the 
State Superintendent at the close of the institute. 
By. comparison we can truly say that this institute was far. 
more effective in point of interest, attendance, work and general - 
results, than any that has been held in the county for many 
years. We make this statement from statistics and from the 
qualified statement of others who were in attendance. 
The institute was in session‘only ten days, but during the 
entire time every department was actively engaged in work. 
The faculty consisted of four of the best institute men that could 
be had, together with the County.Superintendent and local teachers:
-P-A-G-E-538
— 512 — 
The work attempted was rather of the professional nature since 
this faculty actually organized classes and taught many of the 
elementary subjects, not for the subject matter contained, but 
simply to show the untrained beginner how to teach and what 
to teach. Asa result we are having better and more systematic 
teaching in our schools. Every teacher in the County was either 
in attendance on this institute or in some State Institute. 
GRADED CouRSE oF STUDY. 
I have worked diligently to get the schools graded, and am 
glad to report that after having prepared two very comprehensive 
and full courses of study, which we have used for the past four 
years, that every school is reasonably well graded. Each teacher 
is following this specific outline, is classifying, promoting and 
grading pupils according to this course. We are also issuing 
certificates of promotion to pupils in each grade. These promo- 
tions are made according to strict rules and regulations. 
CoNCcLUSION. 
The greatest impediment to the progress of Robertson County 
schools is the lack of funds. But we realize that a revolution 
cannot be wrought in a day in educational affairs, hence we are 
content to labor and wait. , 
COUNTY INSTITUTE. 
Fifty-eight Third Grade certificates were issued as the result 
of the examinations in which 75 applicants participated. At, 
the close of the White Institute, 75 certificates, including renewals, 
State certificates and Peabody Diplomas have been issued in all. 
The attendance and interest on the part of my teachers in 
the county work this year has been very gratifying. We think 
_that we aré justified in saying that our institute has done more 
for the teachers than any ever held in the county. ‘There is a 
better spirit and interest among the teachers than I have ever — 
before observed. I have yet ten or twelve places in my schools 
not filled, but hope to qualify enough in the August examination 
to meet the demand. 
The Colored Institute was by far the best attended that I 
have ever had. We were able to qualify a sufficient number at the 
close of this Institute to fill all our places. We have many things
-P-A-G-E-539
— 518 — 
to make us hopeful for the future in this county. Among other 
things the high school proposition will, I believe, receive favor- 
able consideration in the near future. Our libraries ‘have “been 
raised this year and the best teachers retained.

SCOTT COUNTY. 
The educational conditions in Scott County are better than 
ever before. The school term has been lengthened, many new 
houses built, patent desks placed in more than half of the rural 
schools, salaries increased, and teachers better prepared for 
their work. I am exerting every possible effort to increase the 
efficiency of the schools of the county by eliminating indifferent 
“and incompetent teachers. Our schools all begin on the same 
day, and run the same number of days. The salaries of teachers 
are fixed according to grade. These two movements on the part 
of the County Board have done a great deal toward stimulating 
our teachers to greater efforts. 
A number of school libraries have been established in our 
larger and better schools, but our progress in this work is all too 
slow. Little has been done in the way of establishing School 
Improvement Associations, but we hope to make considerable 
progress in this line of work next year. 
We have three County High Schools making fair progress, 
but they are not what they should be by any means. In my 
judgment one good County High School with our entire fund
-P-A-G-E-541
—.515 — 
devoted to its maintenance, would give more efficient service 
than the three. 
The compulsory attendance law in effect in this county is 
not popular with the people, but has worked well and served to 
increase the attendance in the rural districts. The penalty of 
our present law is too severe and should be modified, so as to 
make the fine for the first offense two dollars instead of ten. 
My administration has witnessed the establishment and 
equipment of an office for the County Superintendent. Here- 
tofore the County Superintendent has had no office, but kept his 
books and papers pigeon-holed in his private residence, but 
now, for the first time in the history of the county, we can boast 
of a first-class up-to-date office. 
During the past two years the educational work of Scott 
County has made much progress. The schools are better organ- 
ized than they ever were. The school term has been increased 
from five months to six months, and for the first time in the his- 
tory of the county, the school term has been equalized, and the 
salary of the teachers fixed on a graded basis. We have placed 
800 new patent desks in the county schools, in place of wooden 
benches. Twelve new buildings have been erected, painted, 
and equipped with good furniture. The graded course of study 
for elementary schools, furnished by the State Superintendent, | 
has been placed in the hands of every teacher in the county, and 
the schools are being graded according to this course, though the 
work is only partly done at this time. 
The attendance in the County schools has been better during 
the past two years than ever before, owing to the enforcement 
of our Compulsory School law, which is very unpopular with the 
patrons of the school, but is favored by the teachers as a good 
and wholesome law. Our present law contains many loop- 
holes by which, under one pretext and another, these who violate 
its provisions can escape. These defects should be cured by 
amendment.

SEVIER COUNTY. 
We believe our county progresses with the education of its 
citizens. We believe a thorough education depends upon the 
early habits of the child, and these habits are moulded largely 
by environment; hence, it behooves to furnish good books, com- 
fortable houses, pleasant surroundings and sufficient equipment 
for our public schools. 
During the past year fourteen school libraries have been 
founded, three school houses have been built and six houses have 
been supplied with patent desks in our county. A few school 
houses have peen painted, and the bills paid with funds raised 
by the teachers and pupils and many houses have been beautified 
through the efforts of the school itself. 
We have no high school, but are expecting to have one or more 
within the next year or so. Our present tax rate is two dollars 
on the hundred, which is a barrier to a high school tax, but I 
hope we may not shut the door of opportunity to the boys and 
girls of our county by depriving them longer of the advantages 
brought by a high school. 
A local compulsory law was enacted for our county in 1909. 
The effect was to raise our average attendance nine hundred, 
three above the previous year. A large majority of the citizens 
are well pleased with the law, and hope it may be made to ex- 
tend a period of four months.

SMITH COUNTY. 
In this report I can not do the good people, and the teachers 
of ‘my county justice, as the results are found in the interest of 
the people manifested in our public schools, and in the qualifi- 
cation and work of our teachers. 
Our scholastic population is not as large now as reported 
two years ago, yet our average daily attendance has increased 
about 1,000. The average salary of teachers has increased 
about 25 per cent. This increase in salary is giving our county 
a better class of teachers. In a few of our best schools the salary 
has increased about 40 per cent; in one school 100 per cent. 
The public is demanding a graded system of schools, and with 
the uniform graded course of study, and with the untiring 
efforts of our teachers, we are fulfilling their demands. 
The school improvement work has done much in bettering 
the sanitary conditions, and giving to us more attractive school 
houses and school grounds. . Two new schools have been erected 
at a cost of $1,500, also several schools have been furnished with 
patent desks. 
We need at least one strong County High School to help the 
excellent public schools of the county to prepare, and better 
qualify the young teachers. : 
In our monthly teachers’ meetings we have 75 per cent of 
our entire teaching force present, thereby showing to the pub- 
lic that our teachers are interested in self improvement. 
‘The services of Prof. M. L. Caneer, as Conductor of the Sum- 
mer Institute were invaluable, and we thank you for sending 
him. 
The institute was, without doubt, the very best and the 
most successful ever held in the county. The attendance was 
large and the punctuality almost perfect. ‘The time was mainly 
spent on methods, and we feel sure that the splendid work done 
here will tell for good in the teaching this fall. In the Colored 
Teachers’ Institute we had an enrollment of 30. The institute 
was conducted by Dr. W. H. Ballard (colored). The work done 
was very satisfactory to the colored teachers and the Superinten- 
dent.

STEWART COUNTY. 
While our schools are far from what they ought to be, they 
have made marked progress for the.last two years. Parents are 
becoming more interested and there is less friction throughout 
the county than was ever known before. 
There are two things we stand badly in need of. The first 
is a County High School, and the second is that of a uniform 
system of licensing teachers. Until we get that system, we 
will have more or less inferior teachers. 
The schools are all graded fairly well, and we hope to have 
uniform examinations throughout the county, for the purpose 
of promoting pupils. 
I have the honor to submit the following on the progress of 
the schools of Stewart County: First, as to school libraries, 
will say that both patrons and teachers are waking up to the 
necessity of having a select lot of books to supplement the eurric- 
ulum, and thereby get the choicest literature into the grades.
-P-A-G-E-549
— 523 — 
Only recently we started a movement to raise library funds, and 
already some eight or nine have turned in nice funds to be sup- 
plemented by the State aid. The good work continues, each 
teacher vieing with the other in her efforts to raise a fund sufficient 
for a nucleus to build to. This work has just begun, but we 
intend to continue to push it until each school has a good library- 
I regard the Jaw appropriating funds for library purposes as 
one of the most advanced steps taken in recent years to improve 
the condition of rural schools. : 
Second, as to School Improvement: This work has been in 
charge of the County Teachers’ Association. Much good has 
been accomplished in the way of improving the sanitary con- 
ditions, as well as beautifying the premises. Every effort is 
being made to make the school more comfortable and homelike. 
Each year old houses are torn away to be replaced by one 
more commodious and more comfortable and attractive. Several 
new houses have been built in the last two years, and many more 
have been supplied with the patent desk.. However, many 
houses are still seated with the straight-backed benches with 
no desk. ‘These conditions are being overcome as fast as funds 
will permit. 
The condition of the schools is about as good as we could 
expect with the funds we have, unless we had the high school 
to complete our system and serve as an incentive for girls and 
boys to strive to advance higher. The merits of the high school 
are too well understood for any one not to recognize its value 
and place in our school system, and it only remains for our County 
Court to recognize this long felt need by establishing one or 
more high schools in the county. This we confidently hope for 
in the near future. 
The local, or county tax, consists of 25 cents advalorem, 
and the $1.00 poll with the varied privileges, This enables the 
county to share the $50,000 to aid the counties that have not 
sufficient funds to run a lengthy term. We are thus enabled 
to run a six months’ term. 
COUNTY INSTITUTE. 
We have closed one of the most successful institutes ever 
held in Stewart County. In point of attendance it surpasses all 
previous institutes held in, the county.
-P-A-G-E-550
— 524 — 
The teachers took active part in discussing the different sub- 
jects and every one did all he could to accomplish the greatest 
good out of the work. 
The State Superintendent has been generous towards our 
county in furnishing us State aid, and as a result our institutes 
have grown in both attendance and interest. 
One feature of very great interest was the able manner in 
which Miss Noble Martin presented her primary plans each af 
ternoon. : 
Prof. T. O. Brooks, who came upon the part of the. State, and 
Prof. Robt. O’Neal who came for the county, handled their sub- 
jects in a masterly manner and at the same time in that practical 
way which brings forth thefbest jresults. 1) aS 
Through the institute the greatest and best methods are 
carried into the most humble rural schools and the results are 
shown in the improved condition of the schools. We look for- 
ward for a greater institute in 1911. :

SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
In addition to my statistical report, I have little to add. Much 
credit is due our County Educational Board for faithful, in- 
telligent and systematic efforts to raise our educational stand- 
ards. Salaries are fixed on merits, and teachers, as a rule, ju- 
diciously located. School houses and school furniture unfit 
for school purposes are being relegated to the background. 
Attractive school grounds and school rooms are coming to the 
front. 
We have a well organized teachers’ association and frequent 
meetings are held.

- SUMNER COUNTY. 
The public schools of Sumner County have made a marked 
progress during the past two years. 
The average salary for teachers has materially increased. 
The County Court levied an additional 10 cents school tax, 
making our school tax 40 cents. : 
A number of new school buildings have been erected. The 
County Board of Education, in every instance where the com- 
munity would put up by public subscription one-half of the 
money, has given one-half to erect modern school buildings, 
and to furnish the buildings with modern equipment. 
Our teachers have taken a great interest in establishing
-P-A-G-E-554
— 528 — 
school libraries which they report very helpful in interesting 
pupils. 
We have an enthusiastic teachers’ association which holds 
its meetings regularly each month at the county seat. The as- 
sociation devotes a portion of its meetings to the study of Read- 
ing Circle texts—all of our teachers are required to study, and 
be examined in the Reading Circle Course. 
The County Board of Education is pushing as rapidly as pos- 
sible the consolidating of our schools. We have put in the Water- 
man-Waterbury heating and ventilating system in a number of 
our schools and find it very satisfactory. 
Our teachers are doing everything in their power to build up 
and perpetuate a “better school” spirit in every community, 
and our patrons are interested as never before. In many school 
communities they have made up the money to put in new furni- 
ture, including talc boards and individual seats. 
During the summer and fall, we held Educational rallies in 
different parts of the county, which have been successful this 
year as never before, in interesting our people in what our schools 
are trying to accomplish. 
Our boys are interested in the Corn Club, and the School Im- 
provement Associations have been sources of help wherever 
organized. The practical idea in education appeals to people 
in rural schools more than anything else, and we are striving 
in Sumner to make our schools meet the need of the every day © 
life of our people.

I have the honor to submit herewith my twentieth annual

Our court levied 15 cents for High School purposes at the July 
term, and we have established two High Schools in the County. 
Covington, to secure one of the schools gives $15,000. The other 
point gave $1,500. The court also made an additional levy of 
10 cents for the common schools. This gives us for the common 
schools including the levy for the State, 50 cents. 
The greatest proof I have of the satisfaction of the patrons of 
the public schools and their good will toward the present School 
Board, and their approval of its management is the fact that but 
little effort was made on August the 4th to defeat any of the 
members of the Board, notwithstanding the political unrest that 
existed in this county at the time of the election, Another 
proof is that the Court was almost unanimous in raising the levy 
for the common schools. 
After making an average of 111 days for all the schools in the 
- county, we have to the credit of the General School Account, 
$3,401.70. 
I believe this gives a bird’s eye view of the situation of affairs 
in my county.

TROUSDALE COUNTY. 
In looking over the schools of Trousdale County, I am glad 
to say that there has been some improvement in the last two 
years. The attendance has gradually increased. I think the 
County Board system a great improvement over the district 
' director system, and believe that much good work in the way 
of school improvement, etc., may be done by them. Several 
schools have been consolidated, and several more should be. 
There are four secondary schools in the county, and an interest 
is being aroused in the establishment of a High School. There 
are too many small schools with barely the requisite number . 
of pupils and most of the buildings are in bad condition. They 
need patent desks, and even necessary conveniences are lacking. 
‘The Board is very liberal under the circumstances, but too rigid 
economy seems unnecessary. 
Last year the school term was seven months, but owing to 
the money spent for necessities, and the increase of salaries, the 
term was shortened this year to four months. There is much 
to be done and I feel that with untiring efforts on my part, and 
the assistance of the board, I shall be able to make a much im- 
proved report two years from now. 
Epna ROBERTSON, 
County Superintendent. 
UNICOI COUNTY. 
In regard to the educational interest and the condition of 
the schools of Unicoi County, in addition to my annual report, 
I beg to submit the following: 
I verily believe that the schools of the county have been 
the best, dusing the year embraced in my report, that we have 
had in the history of the county. The attendance has been 
better, the standard of efficiency of the teachers has been raised, 
and the per cent of illiteracy has been reduced eighteen per cent. 
The reports furnished me for the year ending June 30, 1909, 
showed the per cent of illiteracy of the scholastic population to be
-P-A-G-E-557
   _ 531 _ 
         
        nearly twenty-eight, whereas the reports for ‘the: ¥ 
June 30, last, show that this illiteracy has been Fedtiged 
per cent. 
Of this marvelous advancement we feel proud, yet 
not content with present. conditions, and confidently hi 
make great progress the present year. 
Our greatest need is better school houses, and more neat. and 
attractive grounds. We hope to have these by the close of 5 an- 
other year. 
We have no County High School, as the County Court by: a 
majority of two refused to vote the necessary” funds for its sup- 
port. 
The per cent of illiteracy has been reduced from -40 per cent. 
to less than 9 per cent. This marvelous progress-is due perhaps, 
at least partly, to incorrect reports for the year immediately pre- 
ceding the one embraced in this report. But this great improve- 
ment is chiefly accounted for by reason of a greater-attendance in 
the schools, and better teaching. 
All teachers of the county are required to attend the insti- 
tute and teachers’ meetings; study and pass on examinations 
on the prescribed books for teachers, and read one or more ed- 
ucational journals. : 
Our greatest need is better school houses, furnished and 
equipped, and neat and attractive grounds.

UNION COUNTY. 
Te oR Oo 
With pleasure I can report that Union County has made 
progress in many ways.
-P-A-G-E-559
— 3533 — 
The greatest problem we have had, has been the building 
of good, comfortable houses. 
We now have a number of our schools seated with patent 
desks, and the people are lending a helping hand in all our school 
work. 
We are glad to note that the County Board of Education has 
been a great help to us in looking after the interests of the county. 
We have a compulsory school law, but it does not compel. 
We need a law that makes it the special duty of some one to 
prosecute the parents or guardians for not sending to school. 
Then again, we need a law that has an imprisonment attached 
if no fine can be collected. 
The attendance is good for the first month or two, and then 
the people take their children out to work on the farm, and after 
the busy season is over they never all get back in school. 
We now have more in school than ever before, but we have 
some that we cannot reach in any way. 
Union County was one of the first to have a compulsory 
school Jaw, but there has never been a single parent prosecuted, 
yet children are staying out of school. What is the matter? 
This is the trouble: That which is everybody’s business is 
nobody’s business. 
We are going to look to the next Legislature to give us a law 
that will put the children in school and keep them there. 
There has never been a time in our history when the teachers 
have tried harder to prepare themselves for their work. All 
attend school, with a few exceptions, after their schools close. 
We need a high school to help the teachers, and by helping 
them they in return could do better work in their schools. 
We hope to be able, in the near future, to say that Union 
County stands among the highest along all lines of education.

prevailed and the usual advances have been made.in every de- 
partment of work. 
I have visited all the schools of the county during the school 
term, and have been pleased in the main with what I have seen 
and heard. 
I regret to say that I visited a few schools that could not 
succeed owing to the lack of proper room and equipment. 
It is certainly very gratifying to know that at least 95 per 
cent of our schools are taught by conscientious men and women, 
who are making reasonable progress in honest efforts to popularize 
true education from the position of a real teacher. 
Among improvements that merit special mention are im- 
proved discipline and methods of teaching. In these particulars 
most of our schools have been good all the time, but we have 
' certainly attained to a greater unity of opinion as to what good 
school management and methods are, and have become more 
unanimous in our efforts to employ them. Our teachers’ associ- 
ation meets monthly, and more interest is being manifested now 
than ever before. 
Nearly all of our teachers attended the State Institute held 
at Sparta during the month of June, 1910. 
Some others attended the summer school at Knoxville. 1 
mention this as it shows how much our teachers are interested 
in their profession. 
We have begun to establish libraries in different localities 
of the county. ‘These libraries are proving to be of great value. 
But one obstacle to educational progress in this county is 
the disposition on the part of some of our directors to reduce 
the salaries of teachers. The result is that our best teachers, 
when they have acquired a little experience, go to new fields 
where the remuneration is more satisfactory, thus robbing our 
_ schools of the skill and efficiency which they have in a great meas- 
ure created. 
Yet we have 99 teachers in our county, and I have better hopes 
for the future of the schools than ever before.

WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
We believe that the school system of Washington County 
is becoming more efficient year by year. Each yeat we try to 
profit by previous mistakes and are gradually working to the 
point when we will have a thorough system of graded schools 
in our county. Most of our schools are now secondary, as we 
have reached the point that it is necessary to employ two teachers. 
This not only gives all students who have completed the primary 
course an opportunity to continue their work, but gives to all 
students in the school better advantages for instruction. 
We have five rural high schools in addition to those of Jones- 
boro and Johnson City. While this may not be. best in some 
respects we feel that we have done the best we could under 
present conditions. They are doing some excellent work, both 
in the cities and in the country. 
During the past two years we have erected four new school 
buildings. In two of these we have combined two schools, thus 
decreasing the number of schools and giving to the students 
the advantage of better instruction. We are seating our school 
buildings as rapidly as our funds will allow with up-to-date desks. 
This gives the students better advantages and enables them to 
do better work. We hope in a few more years to have all our 
houses properly seated. 
We have in our county about twenty school libraries and are 
working to take advantage of State aid to secure more. 
In Johnson City and Jonesboro we have regularly organized 
School Improvement Associations and are working to extend the 
work into the rural districts. 
Our County Court has raised the local tax levy to almost 
the limit of the statute. Each year our school fund is increasing
-P-A-G-E-565
—- 539 — 
and we hope that in a few more years our funds will enable.us 
to employ trained teachers for every school in our county. 
Our attendance is gradually increasing” year “byyeat Bi 
feel that it will be many years before it will be what 
be. ‘The compulsory law has had a decided effect in-many ‘of 
schools. The County Board have this year ordered its, , eafeeat: 
ment. What success we will meet with remains to be seen, 
we hope to gradually educate our people to the importance of 
sending their children to school so that in a majority of. cases: 
we will need no compulsion. 
In conclusion we feel that our schools are gradually growing : 
better. We are trying to make the supervision more efficient. 
year by year. During the past year we visited every school 4 ine 
the county except two of the city schools. Many-of them we 
visited two or three times. Our aim is to continue to work until 
we can feel that we are making a true statement:#hen we say, 
“We have a school system in Washington County.” ~

WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
Below you will find a brief report of the schools of ‘Weakley 
County. We have put in about fifteen libraries up to this time, 
with the prospects good for eight or ten more right soon. “We 
have not been able to accomplish as much along this line of work 
as we hoped for. The schools that are now using the-libraries 
are well pleased with the books and are doing more satisfactory 
work than they have ever done before. I am having the spbject 
of school libraries discussed at the teachers’ meetings, showing the 
many advantages that a school with a well selected library has 
over a school without a library, even if all the school facilities 
are equal in all other respects. 
In my visits I am laying special stress upon the importance 
of libraries, School Improvement Associations, and the graded 
course of study put out by the State. With a well. selected 
library the teacher and pupils are enabled to do better and more 
thorough work in all grades. The pupil’s horizon of knowledge 
is enlarged, his interest increased to such extent that he- will 
not be satisfied with anything short of a high school or: uni- 
versity course. : 
With a wide-awake School Improvement Association, the 
local conditions will soon be such as will give the pupil a com- 
fortable school building, well ventilated and heated. As I see 
it, if any very great improvements are ever made on our present 
school condition, in the way of houses and grounds, it must come 
through the influence exerted by the School Improvement As- 
sociation. Again the course of study-has much to do with the 
development of the child intellectually, and for this reason I 
heartily indorse the graded course of study put out by the State. 
We have built six new buildings this year and seated them with 
the best desks we could buy. We have many school buildings 
that are not at all suitable for school buildings, many of them being 
entirely too small, and in addition to this they are poorly lighted, 
heated and ventilated. We have one hundred and twenty-four 
schools in the county, and at least thirty or forty of this number 
not being able to make a daily average of more than fifteen or twen- 
ty. With this great number of small schools, we can never make 
the progress that we could if we had only eighty schools. With 
sod many small primary schools, we are compelled to use many
-P-A-G-E-569
— 543 — 
primary teachers at a small salary, as otir County Board of Edu- 
cation does not think it good economy to pay a good secondary 
teacher a good salary to teach a school that cannot make an 
average of more than fifteen or twenty in daily attendance. If 
we could reduce our number of schools to eighty, we would not 
have a single little primary school in the County, but upon the 
other hand we would have eighty good strong secondary’ schools 
taught by teachers who are qualified to do the work. Con- 
solidation is our greatest need. 
We think the High School interest is growing in this county, 
but so far we have not been able to get a high school tax. Nearly 
all our towns have good public schools that carry pupils through 
the tenth grade and are not suffering so much as the rural 
districts for lack of County High Schools. I think we . 
would have no trouble in getting a High School tax if we could 
insure the County Court that the High Schools would be located 
in the rural districts. However, at the proper time we are going 
to put the matter before the Court for their consideration. 
In addition to the twenty-five cents levied by the county and 
State, Greenfield, Gleason and Martin have levied a special tax 
and run their schools nine months in the year. . Dresden and 
Sharon also run nine months in the year, but do not do it by. 
local taxation. 
We have a five hundred dollar library in my office at Dresden 
for teachers. This I think will greatly raise the standard of 
our teachers. 
We have held a school rally in each civil district in the county 
in which we had discussed consolidated schools, School .Im- 
provement Associations, the State course of study, libraries 
and other subjects suitable to local conditions. We hope we . 
have a greater interest along these lines than we have ever had 
before. COUNTY INSTITUTE. |

WHITE COUNTY. 
White County has made some progress in establishing and 
supplementing libraries. 
Since this time last year twenty orders for books for public 
school libraries have been made by this courity at a cost of more 
than $500.00. I think there will be several more orders before 
long. , 
We have a county organization for school improvement 
work, and a number of local organizations. 
‘Two new school houses in addition to one high school building 
have been erected at a cost of $1,300 this year, and $300 has been 
spent for school furniture. 
You have a report elsewhere of our High School and State 
Institute. 
‘The High School seating and equipment has cost ‘about $1,000. 
‘The State levy for common schools is 15 cents on the $100 worth 
of property. The county levy is 25 cents; the High School 
levy is 12 cents; poll tax, $2.00. 
-The attendance problem is the next in importance to finances 
and fully as difficult of solution. Our Board has acted in favor 
of building sanitary schools next year.

WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
_ Our County Court levied a tax for High School purposes last 
April, and we are expecting the establishment of high schools’
-P-A-G-E-572

to raise the scholarship of our teaching force, and to increase 
teachers’ salaries. 
We have an eight months’ graded school term. 
We have our regular monthly teachers’ meetings, and the 
Reading Circle books are discussed monthly. 
_ I enclose statistical reports of our county institutes (white 
and colored). 
The attendance was good, although a large number of my 
teachers attended State Institute at Fayetteville, and the Sum- 
mer School of the South. 
Our instructors did most excellent work, and a deep interest 
was manifested by our teachers. 
We are urging the purchase of a library for every school in 
the county. 
Miss Virginia P. Mooxe’s efforts for better school houses, and 
more sanitary surroundings, have helped our school greatly. 
We again commend most heartily your very earnest and most 
persistent labors in the interest of the public schools of our State.

REPORTS FROM STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
  
TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
  
‘Hon, R. L. Jones, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—I have the honor of submitting for the Tennessee 
Deaf and Dumb School the following report for the past two 
years. The institution has been conducted as heretofore in two 
separate departments, the department for white pupils contain- 
ing 89 per cent of the total attendance, and located in the City 
of Knoxville, and the department for colored pupils situated two 
miles east of the city on the institution dairy farm. The total 
enrollment for the biennial period has been 346, 185 males and 
161 females. Seventy-nine counties have been represented, only 
seventeen counties, viz.: Cannon, Clay, Fayette, Grundy, Hardin, 
Henderson, Houston, James, Johnson, McMinn, Marshall, 
Pickett, Rhea, Stewart, Trousdale, Van Buren and Williamson 
being unrepresented by pupils. 
There are doubtless quite a number of uneducated deaf 
children in the counties mentioned, as well as in other counties 
which have representatives in the institution, who ought to be 
in school, and I desire to avail myself again of the opportunity 
offered by the biennial report to beg the co-operation of teachers 
of the public schools throughout the State in our effort to collect 
information in regard to such children and to secure their attend- 
ance upon the school. Public school teachers have exceptionat 
opportunities to learn of these children through their hearing 
brothers and sisters. 
The State has provided here facilities for giving the deaf 
children of Tennessee of normal mental capacity a good common 
school education and thus to equip them with a knowledge of the 
world in which they live and the means of communication with 
their fellowman. The school also aims to prepare pupils to take 
their places in the busy world as useful, self-respecting and - 
respected men and women by training them in ways of industry,
-P-A-G-E-578
— 552 — 
neatness, manners and morals. Printing, shoemaking, carpentry, 
dressmaking, etc., are parts of the required curriculum. 
The general health of the school has been good during the past 
two years, but one death having occurred. This record for an 
institution having a constant attendance of about 250 affords 
cause for gratulation and thankfulness. 
The main school premises have been much improved by the 
building of a sightly and substantial stone wall along the east . 
and south lines of our grounds, thus completing their entire 
enclosure with such wall, and by the construction of comcrete 
pavements at a cost of $5,000 for both improvements. The ex- 
penditure of $2,500 additional for inside paving, painting. and 
general repairs has served to keep up and improve the condition 
of our premises. 
As heretofore, what is known as the combined system of 
instruction has been followed. Those pupils promising best 
results under our oral methods have been taught speech and in- 
structed through speech and lip-reading, others being taught 
by manual methods. 
Very respectfully, 
Tuomas L. Mosss, 
Superintendent.

TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND, 
  
Hon. R. L. Jones, State Superintendent of Public Instruction: 
Dear Str—It again becomes my duty and my pleasure to set 
forth the history of another period in the life of the school, a 
period of unqualified success and progress. 
The number of pupils enrolled during the session of 1908-09, 
white, 202; colored, 39; total, 241. There were 50 new pupils 
enrolled. 
Enrollment of 1909-10, white, 199; colored, 44; total, 243; 
new pupils enrolled, 58. The number of pupils in attendance 
this term was the largest since 1905, and in breeding and char- 
acter the children were somewhat above the average. 
Twenty were sent home with sufficient vision to attend the 
public schools. One mentally undeveloped was sent home. 
We have three quarterly examinations each year. Sixty- 
five per cent is the line of promotion. Those reaching 90 per cent 
and above are on the honor roll. 
In 1908-9 there were 88 in the Primary Department, 120 in 
the Grammar School Department, and 33 in the High School 
Department. Total, 241. There were 35 on the honor roll and 
6 fell below 65 per cent, the promotion line. 
There were 7 taking lessons on the organ, 130 on the piano 
and 22 taking individual voice lessons. There were in Expres- 
sion and Physical Culture 129, and 241 in Manual Training. / 
In 1909-10 there were 80 in the Primary Department, 131 
in the Grammar School Department, and 32 in the High School 
Department. Total, 243. 
There were 31 on the honor roll and 16 fell below the 
promotion line, 65 per cent. . 
There were 7 taking lessons on organ, 135 on the piano and 
22 individual voice lessons. 
All pupils received vocal training in chorus classes. 
There were 133 in Expression and Physical. Culture “and 
243 in Manual Training. In the Manual Training Department
-P-A-G-E-580
— 554 — 
boys are taught to make brooms, mops, mattresses, hammocks, 
to cane chairs and pianoforte tuning. 
The girls are taught to sew, to cut and make dresses, to knit, 
crochet and to do other fancy work. 
There were 6 graduates in June, 1909, 4 receiving Grammar 
School certificates and 2 High School diplomas. One received 
a medal for proficiency in music. 
In June, 1910, there were 8 graduates, three receiving Gram- 
mar School certificates and 5 High School diplomas. One re- 
ceived a medal for proficiency in music. 
It has been my effort for years to instill in the minds of 
our pupils a love for learning and for all things refining and 
ennobling, and I feel that my labors have not been entirely in 
vain, as during this period the older pupils and many of the 
middle size ones have shown much improvement in their be- 
havior and have been very studious, and have shown much 
eagerness for knowledge. <A spirit of kindness and good fellow- 
ship has prevailed and has permeated the atmosphere of the 
entire household. 
The health of the household for the entire period has been 
very good. We have had, however, a number of cases of mumps, 
chickenpox and other ailments common to children. 
There was one death at the colored school, that of a little 
girl, Jessie Scales, age ten years, due to heart trouble. 
In accordance with our custom the literary teachers visited 
the public schools of the city, giving special attention to the 
subjects and studies along their own line of work. They did this 
visiting in turns, so that only one teacher at a time was absent | 
from school duties. When their visits were finished and they 
had completed their reports, a meeting was held and their papers 
were read. They spoke of the discipline, of the alertness and 
intelligence of the children as compared to ours and of the general 
work of the school. In many respects we are equal, but the 
advanced classes cover more ground in a given time and -can 
prepare longer lessons, but are not more thorough. Another 
difference they remarked was that in the advanced classes the 
pupils were younger than in ours. The reports were inter- 
esting, showing close observation and careful thought, proving 
that the blind and the seeing, under like conditions, are equal
-P-A-G-E-581
— 555 — 
mentally, but that the progress of the blind, owing to thei in- 
firmity, is somewhat slower. 
In the two years over 3,000 reports of the school and circular 
letters have been mailed to individuals and newspapers in all 
parts of the State, and one of our teachers has traveled in the 
interest of the blind, during the vacation months, 9,851 miles. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Joun V. ARMSTRONG, 
Superintendent.

Hon, R. L. Jones, Superintendent of Public Instruction of Ten- 
nessee: 
Dear Sir—In accordance with your request, I take great 
pleasure in submitting the twenty-third annual report of the 
organization and work of the Tennessee Industrial School for 
the year ending December 19, 1909. 
So many methods of approved excellence for ameliorating the 
conditions of the unfortunate and retrogressive communities have 
presented themselves that no one method can be arbitrarily se- 
lected as the best. But that the moral, mental and physical train- 
ing and development of the youth plays no little part in deter- 
mining the character of the adult and in creating and stimulating 
the standards of progressiveness, is a truth of so wide acceptance 
as to admit of no argument. In recognition of this and to assist 
in the erection of a barrier sufficiently strong to stem the tide that 
is leading to the destruction of the young in our Commonwealth, _ 
the Tennessee Industrial School was established twenty-three 
years ago. This institution particularly desires to assist and. 
honor the homeless boy or girl whose unfortunate condition of 
life bids fair to deny him the training, care and education required 
to develop Christian manhood and intelligent citizenship. The 
results of residence in our institution are immediate and visible. 
The child is placed under a firm, but kind and gentle discipline 
that meets all his true necessities ; he is taught to be a Christian, 
educated to be a practical, intelligent working man; his health 
is protected, proper amusements are provided, and the constant 
desire of the management is to make the institution -so home~ 
like and attractive as to render repugnant the temptations and 
evil influences of the street. 
Under present organization three departments exist—the 
Boys’, Girls’, and Colored Departments. In each of these all 
pupils are given general educational advantages, combined with 
special training in commercial and industrial pursuits, all of which 
are well adapted to arrange their lives on true lines of the most 
useful citizenship. These departments are maintained separate
-P-A-G-E-583

and distinct from each other to meet. the requirements of the 
statutes of the State, which direct, “That the children of the 
white and colored races which may be committed to. said school 
shall be kept entirely separate and apart from each other in 
every way, and they shall not be associated together on any 
pretense whatever, and the sexes shall have separate apartments.” 
It is, in no sense of the word, the intention of the management 
to make of this institution a money-making investment for the 
State, but to use its entire income for the development and educa- 
tion of the children. No child has ever left this school who has 
not been made to feel and understand that he had left a home, 
to which he could always return should adversity overtake him 
in fiis race of life, and many have time and again availed them- 
selves of this privilege. We would be glad for every citizen of 
Tennessee, who can do so, to avail himself of an opportunity 
of visiting the school at such time as will suit his convenience, 
and see himself the manner in which it is conducted. 
The centralization of the higher education problem has, to 
some extent, had its influence over the pupils of this institution, 
and through its potency many a young worthy life has been fired. 
by ambitions he could not attain on account of existing poverty 
in his family relations. Therefore, we suggest that some pro- 
vision be made whereby the bright, deserving boy may continue 
his education and training at the State University, where he 
could satisfy his laudable ambitions. Such provision would 
enable us to exhibit the full fruition of the work begun here. 
However, it is not our desire that all pupils of this populous 
institution should become college graduates. There should be 
workers in the vineyard, and whether we plough, sow and reap 
in the harvest field, or make and mend in volume of mechanical 
resource, if well done, we are equal in governing power over 
the inertia that spurns effort and application. _ 
During the year the health of the pupils has been excep- 
tionally good, and the physician’s report was indeed most grati- 
fying. As to be supposed, there were a number of minor ail- 
ments—colds, coughs and similar affections, but only on rare 
occasions anything more serious, 
The deportment of the young people committed to our care, 
as a rule, has furnished food for many pleasureable conclusions.
-P-A-G-E-584
— 558 — 
The boy or girl who learns in early life the rudiments of obe- 
dience, and due respect for the will of superiors, and does the 
thing that he does not like to do, cheerfully and persistently, has 
laid the foundation for the successful manipulation of educa- 
tional problems, Along the line of our special work there exists 
a unity of desire, with all the benefits naturally accruing to the 
pupil. If by careful, suggestive bearing and kindly spirit, and 
without talking too much, the boy or girl of morose and obsti- 
nate temperament, of inflated selfishness, or idle habits, can be 
impressed with a clearer and more sensible view of life and its 
needs, and what can be accomplished, how and when, the deport- 
ment question has been properly and intelligently solved with 
pleasing remembrances and results to both teacher and pupil. 
Our work-shops and manual training features have proven 
exceedingly beneficial to the pupils, and they have, as a rule, 
been interested in their various duties along the several lines of 
education, taught. The ambition to master the work of the 
department, to which they -have been assigned, has been note- 
worthy. Those who studiously applied themselves to the dif- 
ferent branches of work assigned them—and we are pleased to 
state that comparatively few have not—have been able to find 
steady remunerative employment after their dismissal from the 
institution. A gratifying number of these have attained success 
in many of the foremost trades and professions. The following 
trades and industries have been taught in connection with the 
literary training, extending through the eleventh grade: 
Architectural and mechanical drawing, blacksmithing, barber 
shop work, bookkeeping, bread-making, broom-making, cabinet- 
making, care of steam boilers, care of stock, farming, furniture 
finishing, floriculture, harness and shoe-making, painting, print- 
ing, plumbing, stenography, steam laundering, store-keeping, 
tailoring, telegraphy, typewriting, vegetable gardening, wood 
carving, work in machine shops, work in hotbeds and cold frames, 
work'in barn and care of stock. Many of these departments 
are not only helpful to the pupils, but of unquestioned economical 
value to the institution. Many of the shoes are made by the 
pupils and all repairing is done by them. Most of the clothing, 
furniture, brooms, etc., consumed and used by the institution are’ 
made by the children. We raise most of our vegetables, do a
-P-A-G-E-585
bos — 559 — . 
good deal of the printing, carpentering, painting and general pipe- 
laying repairs. 
Our farm has been fairly productive during the past two 
years, We have raised nearly all our vegetables, We have not 
used any special class of workers in conducting this important 
branch of industry, but have been impressed with the importance 
of teaching as many of the pupils as possible something of 
intensive farming. We believe it well for every boy to know 
something of planting and sowing, of fencing and Hoeing, of the 
principle involved in crop-raising, of the work necessary to 
its success. It would be a fallacy and impotent education that 
permitted a boy or girl to gather an education at the expense 
of the State of Tennessee, who, when it was obtained, would look 
upon the farmer and working taxpayer as inferior, or smite the 
hand that worked for its future possibilities. 
In the school work the children have done well, and here- 
with is appended the grades, limits and system of grading. Gen- 
eral examinations for promotion are held after each session of 
ten months. The children are about equally divided in numbers. 
One-half attend school in the morning, work in the afternoon; 
those going to school in the afternoon, work in the morning. 
This system made possible, by its adoption, the constant opera~ 
tion of both branches of education at the same time, and leaves 
no drones in the hive during school and work hours. 
The music departments continue to be directed by skilled and 
competent teachers. The military band, composed of boys be- 
tween 8 and 18 years of age, enjoys the reputation of being the 
best musical organization of its kind in this State. The won- 
derful execution of these little musical geniuses never fails to 
elicit the most enthusiastic appreciation. All pupils are accorded 
the privilege of studying misic. The power and influence of this 
art enkindles within the fibres of the average boys noble inspira- 
tions and a deep sense of appreciation for culture and refinement: 
We have received from all sources since the opening of the 
institution, December 15, 1886, to December 19, 1909, 5,409 pu- 
pils. Of this number, 4,187 were white boys, 958 white girls, 249 
colored boys, and 15 colored girls. During this same period of 
time, 4,632 pupils have been dismissed, of whom 3,643 were 
white boys, 753 white girls, 226 colored boys, and 10 colored girls.
-P-A-G-E-586
— 560 — 
      
         
    There were remaining in school at the close of the fiseal-year, 
December 19, 1909, 544 white boys, 205 white girls, aid 22 
colored boys, and 6 colored girls, making a total of 777: pupils, 
who were being paid for as follows:

Colored boys 
Colored girls 
   
    White boys 
White girls oe 
Colored boys ........ cece cece een eee eee 
At the close of the fiscal year, December 19, 1908, the date 
of the last biennial report, we had in school 752 pupils. During 
the past year we have received 394 pupils and dismissed 369. ° 
Of this number reecived, 129 were white boys, 41 white girls, 
4 colored boys, and 5 colored girls, committed from the several 
counties of the State of Tennessee to be paid for by the State. 
The remaining 182 white boys, 27 white girls, 5 colored boys, 
and 1 colored girl, were sent to us, to be paid for by Davidson 
County, Maury County, and parents, guardians and friends. 
The Fifty-sixth General Assembly of Tennessee recognized 
the urgency of our need for a pure and abundant water supply, 
and a sanitary, as well as an economical, method of disposing of 
our refuse and excrementitious matter; upon investigation it was 
also made plain to them that our hospitals were not only unsatis- 
factorily located for the isolation of contagious diseases, but were 
entirely inadequate for our needs, Accordingly they appropriated 
$21,000.00 for a water and sewerage system, and $5,000.00 for 
a detached hospital, and for which we shall always feel deeply 
grateful. We have installed an adequate water and sewerage 
system and necessary connections, A six-inch private water main 
was laid, giving us direct connection with the water of the City 
of Nashville, and a twelve-inch sewer was laid from this insti- 
tution to Brown’s Creek. These imperative improvements have
-P-A-G-E-587
— 561 — 
relieved the institution from serious conditions which havé: been 
rightly considered a menace to health and sanitation. We added 
to the $5,000.00 appropriation a donation of. $1,300.00,. and- by 
utilizing the skill and labor of our own people, we-were able to 
construct a substantial brick hospital for contagious diseases, 
and equip it with all modern conveniences, and also enlarge our - 
boys’ hospital to more than twice its accommodations, together 
with installing modern heating appliances and re-equipping it with 
all necessary furnishings. After the completion of the hospitals, 
they were examined by members of the medical fraternity, who 
pronounced them as being correct and applicable in their appoint- 
ments. Our hospital arrangements are such as to enable us to 
take care of practically any emergency or epidémic to which the 
human flesh falls heir. :

UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
  
To the Honorable Superintendent of Public Instruction of Ten- 
nessee: 
Dear Sir: I take great pleasure in submitting my report 
of the organization and work of the University of Tennessee for 
the biennial period of 1908 and 1910. 
_ The encouraging report of progress which I was able to make 
two years ago indicated that the University was making rapid 
Progress in the esteem and confidence of the people of the State, 
as shown both by the influx of students and the generosity of 
the Legislature in providing for a better housing and.a more 
liberal adequate support for its work. The building and equip- 
ment then provided for by the Legislature have been of continued 
and increasing usefulness and will stand as permanent assets 
of the State for an indefinite time. They have, in fact, worked 
a revolution in the methods and scope of the University’s work 
along many lines of extreme importance to the State. . 
The unsatisfactory conditions existing in any institution that 
is uncertain of regular State support is a matter of general knowl- 
edge. It therefore seemed desirable to this Board that it should 
join hands with other educational interests in an effort to have 
the whole State educational system, including the University 
as its head, placed on a permanent basis, both as to its organiza- 
tion and the State’s provision for its support. As a result of 
the united efforts of the friends of public education, the passage 
of House Bill No. 242 (the General Education Bill) was secured. 
The general results of this bill are most excellent for all parts of 
the public school system, from the kindergarten to the University. 
Especially gratifying, of course, is the formal recognition of the 
University as the head of the public school system of the State, 
and the provision of a regular support for it by the provision 
that it shall annually receive, to be used for its maintenance and 
improvement and for the maintenance and improvement of its 
agricultural stations, the amount of seven per cent of the General 
Education Fund provided by House Bill No. 242, being one and 
three quarters per cent of the gross revenue of the State. The -
-P-A-G-E-597

permanent provision for the support of the University in this 
way means much for its future. A great university is the result 
of a definite policy steadily pursued for a long time. With the 
assurance of continuous and increasing State support thus given, 
the Board can follow out a consistent and catefully elaborated 
plan that it believes will lead to results satisfactory to all. 
Tue Boarp. 
For more than one hundred years the members of the Board 
of Trustees of the University were appointed under the provisions 
of the original charter, new members being, as a rule, nominated 
by the Board to the General Assembly and confirmed by it. 
‘The origirial charter provided for a life tenure of the office of 
trustee and did not prescribe a definite geographical or other 
distribution of the members of the Board. Certain minor changes 
in the law had been made from time to time by legislative action, 
which changes had been carefully observed in the selection .of 
new members. The Board became convinced, however, that a 
somewhat more radical reorganization would be to the advantage- 
of the University, and acting under this belief they introduced 
into the Legislature of 1909 a bill to amend the charter of the 
University so as to make certain desired changes in the number, 
geographical distribution, political affiliation, and term of office 
of its members. ‘The act was duly passed and, in accordance with 
it, the Board met and proceeded to reorganize itself along the 
new lines. The perfect harmony that prevailed throughout 
the proceedings for reorganization showed that while in theory 
the old charter was defective, it had in practice lead to the se- 
lection of men who had the true interest of the University at 
heart at all times. Eighteen out of a total of thirty members were 
dropped from the Board at this time, but each one of them felt 
entirely satisfied that the action taken was for the best interest 
of the University. 
By the terms of the amended charter the Board of ‘Trustees 
of the University consists of two members from the City of Knox- 
ville, who may serve as a local advisory cominittee, and one 
member from each Congressional District in the State, making 
twelve members, as the State is now apportioned, and the Gov- 
ernor, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Commissioner of Agri- 
culture, and the President of the University, who are ex-officio |
-P-A-G-E-598
— 572 —- 
members of the Board. Each appointed member serves for 
twelve years, two members dropping out every two years, their 
successors being appointed by the Governor, subject to confirma- 
tion by the Senate. In this way and by other provisions of the 
charter amendment there is an equal distribution of trustees 
from all parts of the State, and many advantages over the old 
arrangement are secured. 
The first Board, as reorganized under the charter was as 
follows: 
His Excellency, the Governor of Tennessee, ex-officio.

While this report was in prepration the hand of the grim 
reaper was laid upon one of the most prominent members of our 
faculty—-a man who for twenty-one years had served the State 
and the University with a rare fidelity. We can not better ex- 
press our high appreciation of his service and his scholarship 
than by quoting from a published tribute by a former colleague 
and friend of many years, Dr. George F. Mellen: 
“Remembering all the golden hours now silent.” 
“In the death of Professor Cooper D, Schmitt, the University 
of Tennessee suffers an almost irreparable loss. The city of 
Knoxville and the State of Tennessee are deeply bereaved. Such 
men are all too rare in an institution, in a community, and in 
a State. Take him as a scholar, an instructor or an individual, 
he was the very embodiment of thoroughness, inspiration and 
genuineness. In the lecture room he put up with no shams,
-P-A-G-E-600
— 574 — 
no makeshifts. In the standards he marked out he required 
nothing short of the highest attainable. In the illustration of 
high civic ideals, his daily life was an unvarying object. lesson. 
As professor of mathematics he did not strive to shine by. the 
endowments and skill so universally recognized. As dean of the 
University he did not care to manifest unusual art in the manage- 
ment of young people. As a citizen he was ready without osten- 
tation to contribute his share to the elevation of society. As a 
religionist he was willing that his precept and exmaple should 
count for their true value without any parade of his professions. 
He was simply content to do his work and to live his life without 
regard to the praise of any man. All of his services and labors 
were rendered in all good conscience and in sincerity. Loyal to 
his high ideals and governed by noble impulses, he was the per- 
sonification of that virtue which shines with a steady light and 
of that religion which is pure and undefiled. 
“The writer of this tribute knew him long and intimately. 
He knew him to have come of a sturdy stock that struck its roots 
deep in a rich soil, He knew him to have had around him the 
influences conducive to the development of a rounded manhood. 
He knew the fidelity with which he made use of opportunity in 
school, college and university. He knew the enthusiasm with 
which he entered upon his vocation as teacher. He knew and 
saw much of the fruits of his careful training of the students 
- that sat under him. The religious family, the church college, 
the broader university, the privileges of the class room—each 
had been utilized to the full extent for preparation and achieve- 
ment, 
“Long after his body has returned to the dust whence it sprang, 
Cooper D. Schmitt’s spirit will survive in the institution and the 
State to which he gave more than twenty years of devoted ser- 
vice. Young men and young women will continue to feel his 
guiding touch and will cherish in their memories the fact that 
they came under so beneficent an influence. A superior teacher, 
a fast friend, a good citizen, the grave will not cover up his in- 
spiring force, while it receives his mortal remains. To his be- 
reaved family and to his afflicted friends he has bequeathed the 
priceless legacy of a stainless name, and of a richly fruitful life.”

The growth of the University reported in the biennial report 
for 1909 has continued during the past two years. Inthe session 
of 1908-09 there was an increase of attendance in the depart- 
ments “‘on the Hill” at Knoxville of 115 over the preceding year, 
making the number of students enrolled in all courses 667. In 
the Medical and Dental Departments at Nashville the enrollment 
was 256, and in the Industrial Department it was 182, making
-P-A-G-E-603
— 577 -— 
a total of regularly matriculated students 1,097. If we include 
the persons in attendance at short courses given under the auspicies 
of the University in different parts of the State, the total reached 
1,577. During the session of 1909-10 there has been a falling 
off in numbers in some courses due to a radical advance in stand- 
ards to adapt our work to the improved work of the high schools 
of the State. This falling off is only temporary and is more 
creditable than a continued increase on the lower standard. 
For purposes of comparison we present again a tabulated 
statement of the attendance in different years made out on Octo- 
ber 23 of the respective years, a day on which it has been cus- 
tomary to make out a statement. The last column includes 
the students of the Industrial Department and of the Medical 
and Dental Departments at Nashville.

  ADVANCE IN STANDARDS. 
The general advance in the standards of education throughout 
the country has necessitated an advance in the standards of 
teaching in higher institutions. The University of Tennessee, 
in common with its sister institutions of the South, has advanced 
its standards for admission as rapidly as the work of public and 
other high schools of the State has heretofore justified. It will 
however, be careful that its requirements are not made so diffi- 
cult as to be beyond the reach of students from schools of good

high school grade. It would, of course, be a waste of the money 
of the State for the University to do the work that properly 
belongs to the high schools and such policy would be discouraging 
to the high school principals and superintendents who are trying 
to build wp the schools to the proper standard. It is important, 
however, that the standards and plans of the University shall 
accord with those of the best state institutions in all parts of the 
country. / 
There is at the present time a general movement to standardize 
colleges and universities and to correlate their work closely and 
logically to the work of the high schools. ‘The high school has 
already been standardized in a large part of the country, the 
‘standard high school comprising four years of work, beginning 
with the ninth grade of the school system. The college, therefore, 
should assume the work of the four year high school as completed 
by the student before his entrance on the standard college course. 
Following this idea, the Association of Colleges and Preparatory 
Schools of the Southern States, of which the University of Ten- 
nessee is a member, has decided that beginning with the session 
of 1910-11 the colleges of that association shall require for full 
admission to the Freshman Class in the College of Liberal Arts 
the equivalent of 14 units, on the system described on page 
23 of the University catalogue. In order to meet this standard of 
‘the association, the University of Tennessee had advanced its 
requirements for admission to the Freshman Class in the College 
of Liberal Arts to 14 units. 
It has established a sub-freshman class, into which it will 
receive students from three-year high schools and other schools 
clearly unable to furnish the 14 unit preparation to be required 
for full college admission. By resolution of the faculty of the 
University, this class is established for the period of five years, 
after which time it is hoped and believed that the high school 
system of Tennessee will have so advanced that the class may be 
discontinued. 
The requirements for admission to the Freshman class in the 
Colleges of Engineering and of Agriculture has been placed at 
12 units, which seems to be as high a requirement as can be 
genuinely met at present by the high schools of the State in 
courses not including Latin. It is hoped, however, that this 
standard can be raised within the next two years to 14 units,
-P-A-G-E-605
—- 579 — 
which may be regarded as the national standard for college 
admission. 
Free TUITION. 
The making of tuition in the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Engi- 
neering and Agriculture free to all Tennesseans and the payment 
of traveling expenses of students by the State has brought the 
University with all its advantages within the reach of the poorest 
boy or girl. The loan funds, by which a worthy student may be 
assisted, and the opportunities for self-help also contribute to 
this end. There is no valid reason why any boy or girl of charac- 
ter and purpose who really desires a higher or professional educa-~ 
tion can not sectire it at the University. In all these respects 
the advantages of the University are not surpassed anywhere. 
INCREASE IN MATERIAL EQuipMENT. 
In our last report we gave an extended account of improve- 
ments in material equipment during the preceding six years. 
Many of the most marked of these were made in the biennial 
period covered in that report. Owing to the smaller revenue 
of the University from the State during the past two years we 
have not been able to carry out as many improvements of this 
kind, but there have been some, as follows: 
A considerable amount of new equipment has been added 
to the various scientific and technical laboratories. In Botany, 
in Zoology, in Physics, and in Geology, especially has there been 
great improvement; while in Mechanical, Electrical, and Mining 
Engineering there have been considerable additions to the plant. 
Old College, the original building of the University, which 
was erected in 1826, has been entirely renovated and equipped 
with modern steam heating and electric lighting, so that it is 
now almost equivalent to a new building It provides quarters 
for the departments of History and Economics, Germanic and 
Romance Languages, and the Department of Law. 
Barbara Blount Hall, the women’s dormitory, has been much 
improved by new oak floors, tinting of the walls, and other re- 
pairs. . : 
Carrick Hall has had additional work of repairs and remodeling 
put upon it with the result that it is now in excellent shape to 
house the departments of Geology and Mineralogy, and of Mining
-P-A-G-E-606
— 580 — 
Engineering and Metallurgy. It also provides a local office 
for the State Geological Survey. , 
A large barn for implements and feeding experiments has 
been constructed at the Experiment Station Farm, which fills 
a long felt need. 
New concrete walks and steps have made ‘the Hiil” easier 
to climb and more attractive to the eye, and a concrete walk 
along a large part of the Cumberland Avenue frontage of the 
property has greatly improved its appearance. 
CaRNEGIE LIBRARY. 
The new library building of the University was donated by 
Mr. Andrew Carnegie on condition that an amount equal to that 
given by him—forty thousand dollars—should be provided as an 
endowment fund for the upkeep of the library. The endowment 
was furnished by the State of Tennessee, which provided a cer- 
tificate of indebtedness of the State, bearing five per cent per 
annum interest. In agreeing to the way in which his condition 
had been met, Mr. Carnegie expressed pleasure at the increasing 
liberality of the State toward the University in recent years. 
The committee secured as architects, Messrs. Patton and 
Miller, of Chicago, who have had wide experience in library con- 
struction, having planned about eighty libraries, many of which 
were built with funds donated by Mr. Carnegie. The building 
is constructed of brick and stone, as shown in the architects’ 
drawing. . 
The characteristic feature of the library is the large reading 
room, eighty-six by thirty-five feet, with eighteen foot ceiling. This 
room is beautifully lighted and ventilated and is entirely un- 
broken by partitions or columns. It accommodates one hundred 
and fifty readers at one time. In addition to the reading room, 
there is a special reading and club room for the faculty, librarian’s 
office, cataloging room, stack room with a capacity of about 
seventy-five thousand volumes, lecture room, public document 
room, four seminary rooms, unpacking room, bindery, and ap- 
propriate cloak rooms, lavatories, etc. 
It is anticipated that the building will be ready for occupancy 
before the close of the present session. 
The acquisition of this splendid building and the reorganiza~
-P-A-G-E-607
—- 581 — 
tion of the library force will work a revolution in certain phases 
of the University work. 
Joint MepicaL DEPARTMENT. 
The rapid advance in the ideals and methods of medical 
education during the past ten years has been most marked, and 
a type of medical school that was at one time almost universal 
has now become entirely out of date. Realizing the importance 
of keeping step with modern progress and the need of greater 
resources to make this possible, the trustees of the University of 
Tennessee have made a contract with the trustees of the Univer- 
sity of Nashville to combine the two medical schools under their 
respective charges and have thus brought about the establish- 
ment of the greatly strengthened and enlarged ‘Joint Medical 
Department.” , 
‘The Medical Department of the University of Nashville and 
the University of Tennessee has been formed by the union of 
two of the oldest medical schools in the South. The Medical 
Department of the University of Nashville was organized October 
11, 1850. It has graduated nearly five thousand physicians 
and surgeons. ‘he Medical Department of the University of 
Tennessee was organized in 1876. It has nearly three thousand 
alumni. The two medical schools were founded by the same 
men, the names of Doctors J. Berrien Lindsley, Paul F. Eve, 
Sr., and W. K. Bowling, being prominent in the early history of 
each, . 
The University of Nashville and the University of Tennessee 
are and always have been sister institutions. As colleges, they 
were both established by the State of Tennessee to carry out the 
purposes of an Act of Congress, which granted to the State two 
townships of public lands, which were to be sold and the proceeds 
applied to “the establishment of two colleges, one in East and one 
in West Tennessee.” Thus arose East Tennessee College and 
Cumberland College, each based on a previous foundation, Blount 
College and Davidson Academy, respectively. They have both 
been always undenominational in character. It is fitting that 
they should now be united in the service of the State and of hu- 
manity. 
The union of the medical schools of the Universities of ‘Ten-
-P-A-G-E-608
—- 582 — 
nessee and of Nashville marks a great forward step in the educa- 
tional progress of the State. Combining the faculties, the equip- 
ments, and the buildings of the two schools, and with the financial 
backing of both universities, the department is now far-stronger 
than either of the component schools separately, and every year 
will add to its substantial strength and development. It is the 
avowed purpose of both universities to co-operate to make a 
medical school of the best modern model. With this object in 
view, great stress will be laid on the splendid facilities offered 
in the fundamental scientific branches, as Physics, Chemistry, 
Anatomy, Physiology, Microscopy, Bacteriology, etc., which 
will be taught by trained specialists in perfectly equipped labora- 
tories. For the clinical instructions not only has the department 
the freest access to the public and other hospitals, but in its own 
hospital, containing more than seventy beds, unrivalled advan- 
tages are offered the student for that practical bedside instruction 
that is recognized as absolutely essential at the present time. 
The second session for the Joint Medical Department is now 
well advanced and the arrangement has been highly satisfactory. 
The students have been afforded clincial and other advantages 
never before possible in this State. : 
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION. 
The work of the agricultural experiment station connected 
with the University has gone on most successfully during the past 
two years. Certain definite lines of investigation have been 
selected and every effort is bent to get definite results on the 
problems being investigated. While the questions are of purely 
scientific nature they are selected largely because of their wide 
bearing on the economic side of agriculture in our own State. 
The work of the local station also includes the supervision, anal- 
yses, and working out of results of the co-operative experiments 
in Middle Tennessee and of the operation of the West Tennessee 
Experiment Station at Jackson. In this way the services of 
experts and facilities provided by funds received from the national 
- treasury are available for use in connection with the experi- 
mental work all over the State, which is a great advantage both 
from the standpoint of economy and of conformity in methods 
of investigation and publication of results. The work of our
-P-A-G-E-609
  — 583 — 
experiment station has attracted the most favorable attention 
throughout the civilized world—and it is looked upon by experts 
as being one of the best organized and best conducted stations 
in America. 
West ‘TENNESSEE EXPERIMENT STATION. 
This station has, since the submission of our last report, been 
brought into excellent condition. The buildings and other im- 
provements planned and carried our under the direction of the 
Commission appointed by the Governor under the Act of 1907, 
providing for the establishment of this station, have now been 
substantially completed, and where there was three years ago an 
unimproved and unproductive tract there is now one of the hand- 
somest farms in the State. ‘The barns and other buildings are of 
a uniform and pleasing style of architecture, and the general 
effect is very picturesque and satisfactory. Provision for the 
support of this station is made by an appropriation in the General 
Education Bill of an amount of ten thousand dollars per annum. 
There is opportunity for usefulness of the West Tennessee Sta- 
tion to an extent greater than can be provided for by this limited 
amount and it is hoped that provision may be soon made for an 
increase in the amount available from legislative appropriation. 
EXTENSION WorK OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
The various lines of outside activity of the members of the 
University faculty which were given in the last biennial report 
have been continued -and extended. In addition to the usual 
short courses in agriculture for farmers and the summer course 
in agriculture for teachers which are conducted at Knoxville, 
there were conducted during the fall and winter of 1909 short 
courses at. Winchester, Cookeville, Jackson, and Dickson. At 
all of these the attendance was good, reaching at two of the places 
totals of over one hundred and forty. During the fall and winter 
of 1910 these courses have been given at Columbia, Jackson,

Of these totals Tennessee furnished 412 students in 1908-00, 
and 354 in 1909-10. 
The College granted the A. B. degree to 14 candidates in 
1908-09, 4 men and 10 women; to 28 in 1909-10, 13 men and 15 
women, a total of 42 for the two years. 
In 1908-09 there were 77 graduated with the L. I. diploma, 
13 men and 64 women; there were 86 in 1909-10, 13 men and 73 
women, a total of 163 for the two years. 
Of the A. B. graduates, 23 were from Tennessee, 9 men and 
14 women; of the L. I. graduates, 100 were from Tennessee, 20 
men and 80 women. Practically all of these have engaged in

teaching, many of them in Tennessee, though financial considera- 
tions often lead them to the Southwest, in spite of patriotic feel- 
ing and of the missionary spirit, the enthusiasm for teaching, 
which is characteristic of all Peabody graduates. 
2. Since our report in 1908 the College has undergone some 
important changes. It has made a strict demarcation between its 
college work and its normal school work, raising the former to 
the standard recognized as national (14 Carnegie admission units 
followed by a four-year college course) and improving the lat- 
ter in definiteness. After long anticipation, the College has re- 
. ceived an adequate endowment for future expansion from the 
Peabody Education Fund, the State of Tennessee, the County 
of: Davidson, and the City of Nashville, and also the deed to the 
premises at present occupied by the College and formerly owned 
by the University of Nashville. These generous gifts insure a 
future for the College in which all the donors can take pride and 
feel confidence. . 
With its new era will come larger efficiency. The College will 
have a more definite sphere of work. It will aim to function as 
a college for teachers, pitching the standard of all its courses on 
the college level and putting the spirit of teaching into all its 
work. By omitting the type of curriculum now offered for the L. 
I. diploma it hopes to leave that field to the care of the various 
State normal schools. I congratulate you and Tennessee that 
you are just ready to inaugurate three such schools. Peabody 
College no longer draws annual support from Tennessee, but has 
not forgotten its past obligation and that much of its permanent 
funds are derived from that source. The changed status of the 
College has in no wise lessened its perennial interest in public, 
universal education for all classes and all ages. ; 
While you will in your normal schools work to prepare the 
general elementary teacher, Peabody will as earnestly strive to 
meet the needs of special elementary teachers, and at the same 
time take care of specific requirements for teachers in all the 
other. types of schools. Peabody and the normal schools of the 
South have at heart the accomplishment of the same results— 
education for all the people by means of better teachers, im- 
proved facilities, more intelligent aims.
-P-A-G-E-613
— 587 — 
With different spheres of effort all directed to one goal, we 
shall soon realize in Tennesse and over the entire South greater 
results from our division of labor than our section, with all its 
marvelous educational growth, has heretofore known,

REPORT OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL INSPECTOR. 
Hoa, R. L. Jones, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. 
Sir—I beg leave to submit herewith my first annual report as 
Elementary School Inspector : 
Tur ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 
Early in the spting of this year 1 was appointed to the posi- 
tion I now hold and assigned to the task of assisting in the work 
of improving the Elementary School. 
The elementary school being pre-eminently the school of the 
people in which we all receive our early training, we are all more 
or less acquainted with its condition today. Most of us know its 
needs, and had we the power and opportunity today, we could 
perhaps, at one fell stroke strike out its defects and create a 
perfect elementary school—a school which would give to every 
child, whether in the country or city, eight months of free public 
school every year; taught by a thoroughly trained and experi- 
enced teacher, in a model school building of modern type. 
T feel sure that every thinking citizen realizes that on account 
of its tremendous influence, the improvement of the elementary 
school is certainly of paramount importance to all. That school 
in which the child receives his first impressions outside the home, 
and which therefore exert a potent influence on the future life of 
the child should have the thoughtful consideration of us all. If 
when a child enters this school he finds organization and system; 
is taught discipline and punctuality, and receives other training 
which gives him a good foundation for the future, his education 
is assured. But on the other hand, if he finds little organization 
and lax discipline, he receives harmful impressions which will be 
difficult to overcome. It, therefore, seems to me that of all 
phases of our educational system, the improvement of our 
elementary schools demands our first considetation.

Course or Stupy. 
In preparing a course of study for the elementary schools in 
Tennessee we have met with some difficulties, but regardless of 
these we confidently expect every elementary school teacher will 
be using the State Course satisfactorily. Our idea in preparing a 
State Course was to promote uniformify in the State, so that each 
county will be doing practically the same work in the same way; 
and with the same guide to go by, A number of counties in the 
State have not had a course of study heretofore, and in those 
that have the courses in the different counties have been entirely 
different. We feel that the use of a uniform graded course of 
study in general use throughout the State will tend to greatly 
unify the system and result in material good to the schools. 
Section 33 of the Public School laws requires “That the 
course of study in the public schools of each county shall be grad- 
ed, and the system of promoting pupils through the different 
grades shall be prescribed by the County Superintendent under 
the general regulations of the State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction.” It was in compliance with the above that :the Course 
of Study has been prepared with a view to assisting County Su- 
perintendents in grading public schools. 
One difficulty we met with is the fact that in Tennessee 
scholastic conditions differ widely; some counties have a school 
term of nine months, while others have a term of only five 
months, hence it is impossible to prepare a course of study that 
will apply with equal fitness to all counties. However, regard- 
less of the length of term every county can use the State Course 
of Study, only the short term counties will be required to give 
longer time to the course than the long term counties. It is the 
desire of the Department of Education to have equally effective 
schools in every county, and ultimately have them all reach the 
same common high standard, and to have the short term coun- 
ties lengthen their school term to at least eight months. 
Time ReQguirep to CoMPLETE THE COURSE. 
The Course of Study as outlined embraces all of the subjects 
of the elementary schools and represents eight years’ work. a 
pupil of average ability can do a year’s scholastic work in eight -
-P-A-G-E-619
— 593 — 
months, hence a pupil may complete the elementary course of 
study in sixty-four months. A pupil entering the elementary 
school at the age of six, can, with eight months’ work each year, 
complete the course at the age of fourteen. He can then entef 
and complete the high school course at eighteen and graduate 
from the State University at the age of twenty-two. ~ 
Counties. which have a scholastic term of only five months, 
say, will not be able to do a year’s work as laid out in ‘the ele- 
mentary course of study in one term, but will be required to 
spend two years’ work of five months each on one year’ s work 
as planned in the course. 
Errect-or SHort TERM ON THE CHILD. © 
Let us notice the effect which the short term has upon the 
child. Entering the school at the age of six and spending two 
yeats of five months cach on one year’s work as laid out in the 
elementary course it requires sixteen years instead of eight to 
complete the course, and he is twenty-two years old when he com- 
pletes the’ cotirse. If he spends four years in the high school 
and four years in the State University, he is thirty years old 
when he finishes school. 
The actual effect of this is that very few pupils complete even 
the elementary course. The tendency of pupils is to leave the 
public school-at sixteen or after; especially is this so with the 
elementary school. They become disgusted or tired and quit the 
school for a position and in most cases their education is stopped 
and the High School and College is never entered. 
A pupil deserves a year’s mental growth along with its year. of 
physical growth, and a year’s mental growth cannot be accom- 
plished in a term of five months. Under these circumstances the 
education of the child suffers.: How many more of our young 
men and women in Tennessee would complete the entire school: 
course if they could finish the elementary course in due time, and 
without. having to spend two years doing what should be done in 
eight months. 
Errect or SHort Term FINANCIALLY. 
Not only does the short term school have the effect of caus- 
ing pupils to leave school without completing the elementary
-P-A-G-E-620
— 594 — 
course even, but it costs the taxpayers of the county more to 
complete the elementary school with the short course than with 
the eight months’ term. 
For instance, suppose the elementary school teacher receives 
$50.00 per month for five months each year. It requires two 
years to do one year’s work, making ten months, which costs 
$500.00. For those counties which have eight months it costs 
only $400.00, or $100.00 less. Figuring this out on a basis of one 
hundred teachers to the average county in Tennessee we have an 
actual expenditure of $10,000.00 by the counties having the five 
months’ term more than it costs those counties having eight 
months’ school annually to do identically the same work. Be- 
sides the counties having eight months do the work more effec- 
tively, accomplish better results, and carry the pupil through the 
school regularly. 
There is eight years’ work to do in-the elementary school. 
At the rate of $10,000.00 per year we find it costing these short 
term counties $80,000.00 more to complete the elementary course 
than it is those having eight months besides requiring just double 
the time in which to do it. This is figuring the salaries of teach- 
ers alone. If we add to this the increased running expenses on 
account of the additional time required, we can easily run the 
figures to $100,000.00. 
What would we think of a private individual or a corporation 
who would give $100,000.00 more to have a certain piece of work 
done than it is costing his neighbor, and at the same’ time spend 
just twice the amount of time in doing it, which his neighbor does 
and as a result of these two acts get a much inferior article? This 
is precisely what a number of counties are doing in our State to- 
day, and what they will continue to do until they so lengthen their 
terms as to give the children of the taxpayers a year’s mental 
growth along with a year’s physical growth. I have always be- 
lieved when the thinking taxpayer seriously figured these facts 
out for himself, he would demand that conditions be remedied. 
Economy does not always consist in spending the least amount 
of money for the present. We must look to the future, and it is 
with the future citizenship of our State that we are mostly con- 
cerned now.
-P-A-G-E-621
Fy — 595 — 
Our public schools will never be what they should be until we 
put ‘into their administration the same business methods which 
the successful business man puts into his own business; until 
every dollar that is spent for public education yields its net return 
to the people for whom it is spent. School business is the same as 
any other business in that business principles apply to it. 
These are some of the conditions which we had to face in 
preparing our Uniform Graded Course of Study for the Ele- 
mentary School, and which we believe when properly understood 
by the taxpayers will be remedied. Every boy and girl in the 
State, whether living in the city or county, should have equal edu- 
cational advantages, and they have the right to demand the very 
best opportunity which the State can afford, and certainly the 
State cannot afford to offer less. 
It is to be hoped that every county will soon realize the 
economy of an eight months’ term even though it sems to cost 
more for the present. 
Orver oF Work As INDICATED IN THE CouRSE OF STUDY. 
Any course of study serves as a guide to the teacher in direct- 
ing her instruction in the different subjects required to be taught 
in the public schools. In this course we have given directions 
for teaching every subject in the elementary course, and have in- 
dicated in a suggestive daily program the order in which they 
should come in each day’s work. 
The program begins with a period for “Opening Exercises.” 
Every school should have these exercises the first thing in the 
morning. They may consist of Scripture reading, song and 
prayer service or some form of practical talks by the teacher. 
They should, of course, be varied by the teacher to suit the oc- 
casion, . Ten or fifteen minutes should be spent’in these exer- 
cises. - . . 
‘After this opening period we have suggested that the next 
period be devoted to “Primary Work,” and have further sug- 
gested that the first period after each rest and the noon recess be 
devoted to this work. This period is intended for the very young 
pupils who are not far enough advanced to use text books, and 
who, therefore, are entirely dependent upon the teacher for their
-P-A-G-E-622
— 596 — 
knowledge. They have very little with which to occupy their 
time, and must depend upon the teacher to keep them busy. 
-Four periods a day is little enough for them. The work they-are 
to do should be carefully planned by the teacher, the aim being 
not only to make it instructive, but interesting’ and Pleasing as 
well. . : 
READING. 
’ The next stbject taken up is Reading. Perhaps more stréss is 
laid on the work to be done in Reading than in any other subject 
jin the course of study.’ There is a special reason fot this.” Read- 
ing we recognize as the key to all of the other’ subjects to “be 
taught. It is the key to all learning and hefice to the education 
for which we aré working. It is, therefore, of tfeméndoug im- 
portance that we learn to read well early in fife. » We have dé- 
voted more than a page to reading in the first grade alone, and 
throughout the entire course much space is devoted to the teach- 
ing of reading. . 
In the fifth year the text books in Reading are finished, and 
many teachers cease their instruction in Reading in this grade. 
This should not be done. Several hours each week should be dé- 
voted. to oral reading. :.In the course of study we have suggested 
that choice selections from good literature be. studied and- read 
from as class work. It is left to the counties to select the litera- 
ture to be studied. Memory exercises and public readings and 
recitations are recommended as valuable. : 
The first three years of the Reading exercises are devoted to 
the mechanical side of Reading. The pupil is taught the observ- 
ance of punctuation marks, pronunciation. enuriciation, etc... In 
short he is learning how to read. In the fourth year. this instrue- 
tion is given the teacher: “Place special stress upon the thought 
getting side of reading, as from now on the pupil will be‘ con- 
cerned far more with thé getting of thought than in the mechan- 
ism of reading.” The pupil heretofore has been learnifg to-read. 
He has now learned to read sufficiently to use this knowledgé as ‘a 
means toward getting information. Because of its acknowledged 
importance. Reading is placed early in the mocning and‘a second 
period is given early in afternoon.

  ARITHMETIC, 
    
   Perhaps after Reading, Arithmetic comes next in, 
It is given an early morning period also, because i 
great deal of mental effort, and should be had while the mind i is 
fresh and most retentive. Its principles should be retained in the 
mind not only as a mental exercise, but on account of their. value 
in the practical affairs of life. Much stress, therefore, should be 
placed on the study of Arithmetic in the elementary sch 
    PHYSIOLOGY.   
* Physiology follows. Reading and Arithmetic and-is “thé ‘last 
subject before the morning rest period. It is placed here because 
it is a comparatively easy subject and the work for the first morn- 
ing period has already been made rather heavy. It is different - 
fom the other subjects of this period, and while not difficulc it 
can easily be made most interesting. 
LANGUAGE. 
The subject which really follows Reading and Arithmetic in 
importance is Language. Language is a study of our spoken 
and written speech, and its study should begin early in the pupil’s 
life. The first two. years is oral work and should consist of work _ 
planned and given by the teacher. The book is not to be placed 
in the hands of the pup‘] until the third year. A great deal of in- 
teresting material for language work is to be found from the 
life of the pupil and from nature. 
Language is arranged to came in “he mid-forenoon period fol- 
lowing the morning recess, giving some time for desk study and 
outdoor work. It is of much importance that the pupil early in 
his school life be taught the proper use of our language and we 
have instructed the teacher to insist upon this not only in theory, 
but in daily conversation in both the school and.out of-it. The 
work in Language; of course, includes both the “Subjects: of 
Language and Grammar. note wos
-P-A-G-E-624
— 598 — 
SPELLING. 
Spelling follows Language, and like Language, text book is 
not to be used until the third year. Simple words from the 
Readers are recommended for use the first two years. In the 
new State Course we have varied in the work planned for this 
subject by completing the entire text in the sixth year, reviewing 
it-in the seventh and in the eighth year, suggesting that spelling 
lessons be taken from the histories, geographies and other sub- 
jects in the elementary course. The text can easily be completed 
in six years. 
The importance of spelling is universally recognized and if the 
principles underlying the subject are taught the pupil early in 
life it is easy for him to become a proficient speller. 
WRITING. 
The subject of writing follows spelling and is the last subject 
before the noon recess. At least fifteen minutes daily is recom- 
mended for this subject. Not merely for practice only, but to 
teach the principles of writing and to direct the pupil’s energies 
along these lines. No teacher should permit careless and un- 
tidy writing in the pupil’s school work, but should at all times 
insist upon careful and legible work. 
GEOGRAPHY, — 
Following the noon recess seems the most opportune time for 
Geography—the subject which appeals to and interests the imagi- 
nation. This study should be begun in the first grade as Primary 
Work. Talks and exercises on home geography should be given 
the pupils, and while the text book is not used until after the 
fourth year, this time may and should be used to give the pupil 
valuable information on the subject, and a good foundation laid 
for the future study. Upon the completion and review of this 
subject in the eighth grade the pupil should have a definite idea 
of the Geography of the world.
-P-A-G-E-625
— $99 — 
History anp Crvics. 
The last principle subject of the day’s work is the History 
period with which is alternated Civics. It is placed late in the 
afternoon because it is among the most interesting of the sub- 
jects of the course and is not so difficult as Mathematics, Gram- 
mar, and some of the other subjects. The late afternoon period 
seems to be the choice period for it. 
The text book is not used until the fifth year, but the first four 
years should be used by the teacher for historical tales, and other- 
wise interesting the pupils in the subject, as well as preparing 
them for the use of the text book. 
Civics is a companion study to History and for that period is 
made to alternate with it in the last year. 
Vocat Music. 
The day’s work is closed with Vocal Music. It is a rest sub- 
ject and tends to relieve the mind from the day’s toil. Teachers 
should always find time to devote a few minutes at the close of 
each day to singing and giving instruction to the pupils in the 
principles underlying vocal music. 
Extent or Its Use. 
Ten thousand copies of the Course of Study were printed by 
the Department of Education, and a sufficient number sent to the 
County Superintendent of cach county to supply all of the ele- 
mentary teachers. With this a circular letter was written asking 
the Superintendent and Boards of Education to insist upon its 
use. 
After the schools had been in session about three months 
the following circular was sent to the County Superintendents for 
the purpose of finding out to what extent the Course of Study 
was being used : 
Dear Str: During the summer we sent you a sufficient 
number of copies of the Graded Course of Study for Ele- 
. mentary Schools to supply all of your teachers. We did

this because we are anxious to have the new Course in 
general use throughout the State. 
Below are some question which please answer and re- 
_ turn at once to this office, indicating answers on this sheet:

the Elementary Course of Study for all of your 
Elementary teachers? .

cordance with the directions given? 
Answer 
(4) Is the method of grading outlined in this Course 
proving satisfactory in your county? 
ANSWEF cocci cece cee 
(5) What suggestion, if any, have you to offer? 
Answer 
Answers to this circular indicated that all counties have been 
supplied with the Course, copies being furnished teachers at the 
beginning of the school terms. In practically every county teach~ 
ers were reported as following the system of grading as far as 
conditions would permit, some being hindered by the short term 
and ungraded conditions of some of the schools. 
_ Every Superintendent reported the grading as satisfactory. 
However, some thought it could be improved by having fewer 
than eight grades. _ 
It is almost impossible in counties where the Superintendents 
are not employed to devote their entire time to’ supervising the 
work, to‘ know just how successful the work of gradation is 
proving. It seems, however, that an honest effort is being made 
to carry out the instructions, and in due course of time the schools 
will be substantially benefited.
-P-A-G-E-627
  Ungraded schools cannot arbitrarily be made to- conform to 
any ‘system of gradation at once. It.may. require. onestwo, ‘er: 
even three yeats to properly accomplish this .result.s..Certainly 
sufficient time should be given pupils.to.adjust:themselves,to the 
new standard in order not to neglect:any: part of:the work. :- 
I have gone with some detail into the gradation of the schools 
because I ‘have been working especially along this line. In fact, 
I have given practically my entire time to the preparation of and 
putting into operation the Courses of Study for the Elementary 
Schools. In doing this I have-had the opportunity to visit more 
than half of the counties, meeting:teachers and other citizens in 
monthly institutes and public school mass-meetings. I feel that 
the unifying and systematizing of the work in the Elementary. 
School is of highest importance, and our purpose is to accomplish 
something definite along this line before proceeding to other fea- 
tures,      
Conclusion. 
So much for the detail work of the Course of Study. If it 
results in bringing about more unity in the public school system 
of our State, and making more uniform the work in each county ; 
if it will tend to bring the taxpayers to realize the expensive- 
ness and evil results of the short term schools, and at the same - 
time to realize the advantages of the eight months’ term; if it 
will tend to help the hundreds of inexperienced teachers, who 
begin teaching each year without any guide in. grading their 
schools, we shall feel that we have been fully repaid for our labor 
in preparing this course and for our time and trouble in traveling 
over the State in order to secure its uniform adoption. 
It is our belief and hope that this course will not only be a 
guide to teachers, but will prove an incentive to students to pass. 
regularly step by step through the different grades. It should 
give parents and school officers a better opportunity to judge of. 
the work being done by the school. We hope also that. it- will 
have a tendency to bring about a closer co-operation between 
teacher and parents. For while the course will help in many ways 
to improve the school work, the burden must still rest with par- 
ent and teacher. Unless a teacher goes. into a community deter- 
mined to give value received for her services and determined as
-P-A-G-E-628
— 692 — 
well to make the community better by her having gone into it, 
she will be handicapped. On the other hand, parents should lend 
their hearty co-operation and spare no means to make the 
school a success. If the building is dirty and dilapidated, it 
should be improved. If the grounds are unsightly they should 
be beautified. This can be done in a thousand ways v which will 
suggest themselves to the wise teacher. 
It has seemed necessary to give most of my time to the Course 
of Study in order to accomplish the results we were working for. 
Tt has not been possible to do this and render much service along 
other lines of the work. There are many features of the Ele- 
mentary School work which it is necessary to improve before the 
school can attain its greatest usefulness. 
BuILpincs. 
In the rural districts the Elementary School, especially, is in 
need of better buildings and equipment. The average building 
in these communities is hardly comfortable in cold weather, and 
certainly not such as to. inspire a feeling of pride. To perform 
its greatest function the schoo! should be both the educational and 
social center of the community. Social gatherings, as well as 
school, should be held in the school house, and in other ways 
should the school building be of service to the people to whom it 
belongs. In no better way can a live interest be aroused in the 
welfare of the school. It is difficult to bring about these results 
in a county when the building is dilapidated, unsightly and un- 
comfortable, and, as is often the case, the worst house in the 
community. 
The school building should "be constructed with a view to the 
comfort and health of the child. Attention should be paid to the 
heating, lighting, ventilating and seating. It should certainly be 
made home-like and attractive, and such that the people will take 
an interest and pride in. Many Boards of Education realize this 
and desire better buildings, but are hampered by a lack of money. 
Under the present law it is necessary to use the general school 
funds for building purposes. Consequently, the building of bet- 
ter school houses results in a proportionate decrease in the length 
of school term, The building is done at the expense of the chil- 
dren.
-P-A-G-E-629
— 603 — or 
If counties were given authority to issue bonds for building 
purposes, modern buildings could be erected and equipped: wher- 
ever-needed without taking from the children or proving a bur- 
den to the taxpayer. There is a strong demand for this through- 
out the State, and I feel sure such action on the-part of the Leg- 
islature would be heartily approved by the people who are inter- 
ested in the educational welfare of our State. 
TEACHERS. . 
Along with the proper gradation of the Elementary School is 
the need for better trained teachers; teachers who have pre- 
pared themselves especially for this work, and who enter upon it 
with a view to making it their life profession instead of.a step- 
ping stone. It is impossible to secure the services of such teach- 
ers in the rural schools so long as we offer our present meagre 
salaries and otherwise uninviting conditions. In order to secure 
and retain the best talent we must make the work more lucrative 
and attractive. “ 
CoNSOLIDATION. 
The consolidated rural school represents the advanced type of 
the elementary class. In this large and centralized school is rep- 
resented the forces which heretofore were represented by three or 
four smaller schools. In these smaller schools the work done was 
inefficient and very little progress was attained. Each one repre- 
sented the same number of grades as are taught in the consolidat- 
ed school, consequently they unnecessarily duplicated each other. 
There is a marked tendency in advanced rural communities 
to consolidate these weak schools into larger ones located in the 
center of the communities affected. The average rural school is 
weak by reason of its small number of pupils and consequent lack 
of funds. In the consolidated school it is possible to secure a 
better type of building and the services of better teachers, as well 
as lengthen the term. In fact, the power of the school is material- 
ly increased in every way. 
TRANSPORTATION OF PUPILS. 
Examples of successful consolidation of rural schools may be 
found in several counties. Two, three and even four schools
-P-A-G-E-630
— 604 — 
may be abolished and a central school established without re- 
quiring the pupils to walk too great a distance. This is the usual 
way. However, Shelby County furnishes us an example in the 
transportation of pupils above the fourth and fifth grade. “In 
several communities in that county the grades above the fourth 
have been consolidated and the pupils transported to the central 
school in wagonettes. So far as I have been able to learn, it is 
proving successful and growing in popularity, this year eight new 
wagonettes having been put in operation. The cost is not neces- 
sarily decreased by the transportation of pupils to a consolidated 
school, but the advantages along other lines are very great. The 
wagonettes cost from $150.00 to $200.00, and the driver is paid 
from $40.00 to $80.00 per month for his services and. that of his 
team. 
The wagonettes will carry from twenty to fifty pupils com- 
fortably. They have closed tops and a small stove keeps the in- 
side comfortable no matter how disagreeable the outside weather 
may be. : 
Miss Mabel Williams, County Superintendent of Shelby Coun- 
ty, is giving encouragement to the transportation plan. She re- 
ports that the people of the county were formerly opposed to it, 
but after a few ‘successful attempts were made the citizens of 
other communities began asking for it. Now, the County Board 
has more petitions before it from communities wanting to be 
transported than can be granted.

GRADED COURSE OF STUDY FOR THE ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOLS OF TENNESSEE, 1910. 
GRADING, 
EXAMINATIOM AND PROMOTION OF PUPILS. 
Section 33 of the Public School Laws requires, “That the 
course of study in the public school of each County shail be graded 
and the system of promoting pupils through the several grades 
shall be prescribed by the County Superintendent thereof in ac- 
cordance with the general regulations of the State Superinten- 
dent.” In compliance with the above Act, the following Course of 
Study has been prepared with a view to assisting the County Su- 
perintendents in grading the public schools. 
Scholastic conditions in Tennessee differ widely in the differ- 
ent counties, some counties have a school term of five months, 
while others have a school term of nine months, hence it is im- 
possible to make a course of study that will apply with equal fit- 
ness to all the counties.. However, it is the desire of this Depart- 
ment to have equally effective school systems in all the counties of 
the State and to have them all reach the same common high stand- 
ard. The Course of Study as outlined embraces all the subjects of 
the elementary schools and represents eight years’ work. A pupil 
of average ability can do a year’s work in a period of eight months, 
hence a pupil may complete the elementary public school course ift 
sixty-four months. Counties that have a scholastic term of only 
five months will not be able to do the year’s work as laid out in 
this course of study, but will be required to spend two years of 
school on one year of the course. However, it is to be hoped that 
within a few years every county in the State will have a complete 
scholastic year of eight months, and that each child be permitted 
to secure a year’s mental growth along with its physical growth. 
- EXAMINATION AND PROMOTION—Examinations 
should be held at the close of each term and certificates of promo- 
tion should be granted the pupils completing each grade. Teach- 
ers should indicate at the close of the year in the school register
-P-A-G-E-634
—— 608 — 
the grade to which each pupil belongs, so that if. there is a difte1 
ent teacher the following year,-she will not be disturbed in 
making the proper classification if the student should lose his 
certificate of promotion. 
Promotions should be made from grade to grade with the 
greatest care, as no greater injury can befall a pupil than that of 
being rushed from grade to grade with little knowledge of the 
matter passed over and with an utter lack of appreciation for the 
subjects to come. Each grade has its own special work to do and 
“it i is ‘a grave mistake to promote a pupil that is unprepared, ex- 
pectiig him to make it up in the next grade, for experience 
teaches that he is worse behind in the following than in the pre- 
ceding grade. 
Under no circumstancés should the grading be crossed, except 
in schools with only one teacher, and all the eight grades or 
eight years’ work represented in the same. In such cases the 
teacher will be compelled to combine some of the classes i in order 
to have sufficient time to devote to the recitation. 
_ Pupils completing the elementary course of study as outlined 
in this booklet, will be given a Primary Certificate signed by 
the State and County Superintendents, the local School Board and 
Principal of the school. This certificate will entitle the holder to 
enter a public county high school. The final examination for the 
completion of the elementary course should be given by the Coun- 
ty Superintendent and he or a committee appointed by him should 
grade the manuscripts of the pupils. This will standardize the 
schools of the county, and prevent those who are unprepared from 
passing. 
_ Any student who can make an average of 80 per cent and not 
fall below 60 per cent in any subject should be promoted. The 
class standing of the pupils should also be considered and should 
count at least one-half in making ‘the promotion ; for instance, 
if the class average is 90 and examination is 70 the pupil is 
entitled to a rating of 80. ; 
- The support of school officials and public school teachers is 
most earnestly desired in bringing about as nearly as practicable 
a uniform system of gradation. _. Sincerely yours, ° 
woe ee ' R. L. Jones, 
State Si superintendent of Public Instruction.

COURSE OF STUDY. 
FIRST YEAR. | 
READING—Wheeler’s Primer and Hill’s First Reader. The 
best method is that which combines the word (or sentence or 
thought) method with the phonetic: method. The pupils should - 
have daily drill along two distinct lines: (1) Sight reading, (2) 
sounding single letters and groups of letters. The work should 
be from the blackboard for the first six or eight weeks and the 
reading matter should grow out of the life of the child, so that 
he feels that he is reading a record of his own experiences. The 
vocabulary: of the reader may be divided into action words, ob- 
ject words, descriptive words, etc., and the child may perform the 
actions, handle the objects, and find something that meets the de- 
scription. Filling the child’s mind with the idea in this way, be- 
fore he is permitted to read aloud, is a great aid in securing a good 
expression, which from the beginning should be one of the teach- 
er’s aims, Other aids to the expressions are (1) requiring the 
child to read only short sentences at first; (2) riever permitting 
him to read single sentences aloud until he has first read them to 
himself; (3) giving him a chance to ask for any word he does not 
know before he reads the sentence; (4) questioning him to bring 
out different thoughts, by different inflections in the same sen- 
tence; (5) furnishing him with good models in expressive read- 
ing, for imitation has its uses as well as its abuses; (6) giving 
writing directions for the child to read silently and obey. Side by 
side with his thought reading should run daily work in (1) the 
sounds of the separate letters, consonants first, vowels later, singly - 
and combined, as pl, fr, ig. These are taught at the rate of one 
sound in a lesson, all the others previously taught being daily re- 
viewed, stories and pictures of the objects that make the new 
sound aid greatly here. (2) Train in quick perception of phonetic 
blends given by the teacher’s telling a story or giving directions, 
introducing here and there a word ‘sounded instead of pro- 
nounced; that is, its successive sounds being given rapidly, but 
distinctly, and the children being required to tell the word. (3) 
Training in finding out a new word formed by sounding the let- 
ters composing it. Concert work is not good here. Each child
-P-A-G-E-636
— 610 — 
should have daily practice in calling rapidly the sounds of the 
letters making a word, and then giving the word. The child 
need not be held responsible for these words afterwards, and 
the aim being skill in the process of finding out new words by 
giving the sounds of the letters composing them. The lines of 
* work suggested above should be continued through the first year. 
Books should be placed in the hands of the pupils the first two 
months or thereabouts. The teacher should keep ahead of the 
lesson in the book, preparing the children for it by teaching them 
new words from the boards first. The phonetic work should be 
continued through the year. 
SPELLING—Words should be chosen for spelling from 
words the children know by sight in the reader. The most useful 
words, those employed most often and from which the largest 
number of sentences should be chosen. Use the phonetic knowl- 
edge acquired in the reading lesson in spelling lists of words 
having a common phonetic element. Short sentences should be 
dictated and the spelling of common idioms taught. 
WRITING—The teaching of writing should begin at the 
same time ‘as that of reading and spelling. Pupils should copy 
short sentences made of words learned in the reading lesson. 
Much board work should be done by the pupils during the first 
half of the year. . 
Simple exercises to induce free arm movement should be 
given at the board. Forms of letters may be impressed on the 
child’s mind by stories and devices. Careful attention should be 
given to position. 
NUMBERS—Jones’ Elementary Arithmetic, pages I to 25, 
is used as a basis for the work. The book should be in the hands 
of the teacher only. Children should be taught to count by ones, 
twos and threes. For material for counting use the words in the 
reading lesson. The boys and girls in the different rows of seats, 
the sunny days in the board calendar, the nature work material, 
etc. Games add interest to the work, as do construction lessons 
in cardboard. The following lessons should be given on each 
number: (1) The number as a whole, the pupils being required 
to recognize, choose and discover it; (2) the facts in that man-
-P-A-G-E-637
— 611 — 
ner; (3) measuring facts involving the number; for example, 
in connection with No. 2, teach two pints equal one quart. 
LANGUAGE—Oral lessons given by the teacher in stories, 
nature lessons, games, children of other lands, pictures, etc. 
Copying short sentences, and making original ones, employing 
words learned in reading and spelling. Careful note should be 
made by the teacher of errors in English made by the children in 
talking and the exercises given to correct those. 
VOCAL MUSIC—Singing by: note in two-part measure and 
by rote. Singing games learned by imitation. Care should be 
taken to use childlike songs, into the spirit of which the children 
can enter. : 
SECOND YEAR. 
READING—Hill’s Second Reader. The spiritual side and 
the mechanical side of the work should each receive attention. 
The thought content of the subject matter should be carefully 
brought out, and continued drill in phonetic work should be 
given. All words not in the pupil’s vocabulary should be thor- 
oughly taught as to form and meaning. A good way of accom- 
plishing this is as follows: The teacher suggests the idea of the 
word, not giving the word itself, When the pupils’ minds are 
filled with the idea suggested, the teacher writes the word on 
the board and requires the pupil to tell what it is by sounding it. 
They are then required to spell it and to use it in sentences. 
Dramatizations used in connection with the lessons adapted to 
it add much life to the reading lesson. The children may read 
the lesson silently or orally, and then plan to play the selection, 
telling the characters represented choosing the part for each 
child to play, deciding upon the material, etc. If reference to 
the book is needed so much the better.. Constant use of books 
adapted to this grade and of supplementary readers and leaflets 
adds to the efficiency of the work. 
SPELLING—Words in the reading lessons to be spelled. by 
sounds and by letters and silent letters to be named, Diacritical 
marks stressed. Oral and written spelling both to be used. 
WRITING—Copy book No. 1 used, with pencil only. Habits 
of correct position insisted upon. Form and spacing emphasized. 
Much exercise to secure good movement given.
-P-A-G-E-638
— 612 — 
ARITHMETIC—Jones’ Elementary Arithmetic, pages 25 to 
57. Book in the hands of the teacher only, who will eliminate 
such exercises as are not applicable to the grade, and add such as 
may be needed to give the necessary drill required. Construction 
work is a pleasant way of learning measurements, and is'a never- 
failing source of enjoyment to the children. Various games af- 
ford a good way of drilling on the table, the pupil being required 
to multiply his score by the number being studied. 
LANGUAGE—Advanced work along the lines suggested in 
the first grade. In written work require the child to write com- 
plete statements answering a series of questions written on the 
board by the teacher, thus forming a connected composition. 
Later he may produce these stories from a topical outline alone. 
VOCAL MUSIC—Continue the work of the first grade with 
more advanced subject matter. Teach note singing, three-part 
measure, Patriotic songs should be taught, as well as games 
adapted to the grade. 
THIRD YEAR. 
READING—Hill’s Third Reader. Give close attention to ex- 
pression and articulation, teach modulation and emphasis with 
care, drill the pupils in the ready recognition of words, thereby 
preventing halting and stammering. To insure complete mastery 
have pupils use each new word in an original sentence. The 
pauses in the reader must be thoroughly taught. Give much 
supplementary matter and a test on sight reading. 
Every pupil should read at least three books in this grade if 
possible. Reading should now serve a double purpose, viz: to de- 
velop and master the art of comprehension and expression, and 
also for general information and culture. It is a good idea to 
discuss the lesson before permitting the pupils to read it orally in 
the class. Ask such questions as, What is the lesson about? 
What characters and incidents are connected with it? Go into 
details of the story, and see that the child properly understands 
the subject. 
Frequent use should be made of the school library, and selec- 
tions from good prose and poetry should be read, studied and 
committed to memory. Use such supplementary reading as in 
the judgment of the teacher is best suited to the child.
-P-A-G-E-639
— 613 — 
SPELLING—Hunt’s Progressive Course, pages 1 to 80. In 
this grade the book is first put into the hands of the pupil. Both 
oral and written spelling should be taught, placing greater stress 
on written work. Weekly drills should be given, reviewing the 
most difficult words. Make use of the Dictation Exercises and 
note the rules of spelling. 
WRITING—Copy Book No. 2. There should be a period 
of at least fifteen minutes each day set aside for the teaching of 
writing in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth years. The form of 
letter should be critically studied, and special attention should be 
paid to spacing. Require neatness and accuracy and accept noth- 
ing but pupils’ best efforts. 
LANGUAGE—Onur Language, First Book, pages 1 to 96. 
Attention should be given to the oral expression of the pupil. 
Cultivate the habit of using correct English. In the written work 
observe closely the spelling, writing and punctuation. Oral and 
written composition should be given much attention. The readers 
and the libraries should furnish an abundance of material for 
composition, and better still, require the child to use his powers of 
observation and express on paper what he knows of the things 
he meets in every-day life. 
ARITHMETIC—Jones’ Elementary, pages 57 to 100. Book 
in the hands of the pupils. Drill in the fundamental operations. 
Strive for’ accuracy and rapidity, prohibit counting on fingers. 
The pupil should become proficient in the use of the multiplication 
table up to the tens. Practice reading and writing numbers to 
one hundred thousand. : 
VOCAL MUSIC—Rote songs. Simple vocal drills, sight 
reading from board and chart. 
FOURTH YEAR. 
READING—Hiill’s Fourth Reader, completed. Pay careful 
attention to punctuation marks, stress and emphasis. Do not pet-_ 
mit a pupil to attempt to read that which he does not understand. 
Strive to cultivate the reading habit. The teacher should be able 
to measure the capacity of each pupil and refer him to literature 
suited to his taste and advancement. If any consecutive lesson
-P-A-G-E-640
— 614 — 
should prove too difficult for the class, pass it by until the pupil’s 
advancement is sufficient to grasp it. Make frequent use of the 
school library and use such supplementary reading matter as the 
interest of the class requires. 
Place special stress upon the thought-getting side of reading, 
as from now on the pupil will be concerned far more with the 
getting of thought than in the mechanism of reading. Commit 
to memory the finer bits of literature contained in the lessons, and 
encourage the pupils to read choice selections from the library. 
WRITING—Copy Book No. 3. Special attention should be 
given to position, spacing, form and movement. 
SPELLING—Hunt’s Progressive Course, pages 80 to 113. 
Drill on the diacritical marks and accent. Attention should be 
given to articulation and oral spelling. New words in all studies 
should be spelled. 
ARITHMETIC—Jones’ Elementary, pages 100 to 155. Teach 
the symbols of operation thoroughly, drill until the pupil can per- 
form with rapidity and accuracy all the fundamental operations. 
Give special attention to common and decimal fractions. 
LANGUAGE—Our language, First Book, pages 96 to 199. 
Continue the work of the third grade, give exercises to overcome 
incorrect forms of speech, such as can for may, done for did, etc. 
Drill on the correct uses of sit, set, lie, lay, saw, seen, etc. Greater 
stress should be placed on written work during this year. For 
copying and dictation use material that illustrates the new rules 
of punctuation and capitalization learned by the pupils. In ad- 
dition to simple, original written compositions, not more than two 
or three paragraphs in each, based mainly on personal incidents or 
experiences, and on easy short descriptions and narratives, give 
careful attention to spoken language of all pupils. For additional 
instructions in regard to written work, see suggestions to teach- 
ers, pages 195-196, Teachers’ Edition, Our Language, First Book. 
PHYSIOLOGY—Lippincott’s First Book completed. Pupils 
should be taught the correct posture while sitting, standing and 
lying, the correct way of climbing stairs, the necessity of play, the 
effect of alcohol and narcotics, the need of fresh air and the value 
of outdoor sports.
-P-A-G-E-641
— 615 — 
GEOGRAPHY—Frye’s First Course, pages 1 to 87. Draw 
plan of school room to scale, locate objects on the plan, draw plan 
of school district, locating school house in order to teach children 
the purpose of a map. Study land and water forms, the action of 
water. Bring out strongly the relation existing (a) between re- 
lief and drainage; (b) relief and climate; (c) climate and pro- 
duction; (d) physical features of a country, and occupation of 
men. Map-making and reading should be thoroughly taught. 
VOCAL MUSIC—Simple songs by rote, more difficult ones 
by note. 
FIFTH YEAR. 
READING—Hill’s Fifth Reader, completed. Recitation 
three times per week, alternating with history. Encourage pupils - 
to consult the dictionary for the exact meaning of words. Con- 
tinue the memory exercises and the use of the library for sup- 
plemental reading. . 
HISTORY—Makers of American History, completed. Reci- 
tation twice a week alternating with the Reader. While History 
alternates with reading, it is not the purpose to recommend the 
reading of history as an exercise, but it should be taught as his- 
tory. Biography forms an important part of history in this 
grade, yet the great events that have shaped the destiny of the 
country should be mastered. Study the causes and results of wars 
rather than the specific details of battles. Historical games and 
plays may be used to good advantage, such as a dramatization of 
the Boston Tea Party, Bacon’s Rebellion, etc. Parallel reading 
bearing directly on the subject should be recommended by the 
teachér and furnished by the school library. 
WRITING—Copy Book No. 4. Give at least fifteen min- 
utes each day to writing exercises, giving special attention to 
form, movement and position. Continue to stress accuracy and 
neatness, giving some exercises for speed. Accept nothing but - 
the pupil’s best effort. 
SPELLING—Hunt’s Progressive Course, pages 113 to 141. 
Give frequent drills on words commonly misspelled. Stress syla- 
Dification, accent and diacritical marks. Note the rules for spell- 
_ ing and make use of the dictation exercises contained in this 
section.
-P-A-G-E-642
— 616 — 
ARITHMETIC—Jones’ Elementary, pages 155 to 216, Fre- 
quent drills in the fundamental operations to secure accuracy and 
rapidity. Common and decimal fractions should be closely cor- 
related. Have a system of weights and measures and teach com- 
pound numbers in the practical business way in which: they are 
used. 
LANGUAGE—Our Language, School Book, pages 11 to 126. 
Continue oral and written productions. Have the pupils study 
an imitate model compositions. Have pupils analyze selections 
making topical outlines, then rewrite the selections from these 
outlines, comparing their compositions with the original. For 
drill in enunciation and punctuation have pupils recite from mem- 
_ ory and write from dictation, paragraphs and stanzas. Encourage 
children to exchange letters with those in the same grade in 
another school, 
GEOGRAPHY—Frye’s First Lessons, pages 87 to 164. Give 
special attention to the climate, animal and plant life of the dif- 
ferent countries. Continue map drawing, and the location of 
important cities, giving reason for their location. 
VOCAL MUSIC—Songs, ear training, sight reading con- 
tinued. 
SIXTH YEAR. 
LITERATURE—To be selected by local authorities. 
History of Tennessee, McGee, completed. Give special at- 
tention to early settlements and the part Tennessee has taken in 
the national government. Note Tennessee’s war record, and make 
a study of her system of education. The study of Tennessee 
history should be found very interesting, and much instructive 
supplemental reading may be found on the subject which should 
be used. 
WRITING—Copy Book No. 5. See that all written work 
is carefully and neatly done. Accept only the pupil’s best effort. 
The writing habit is largely formed during the fourth, fifth and 
sixth grades, hence the greatest care should be exercised. 
_ SPELLING—Hunt’s Progressive Course, pages 141 to 176. 
Practice both oral and written spelling. Teach simple rules of
-P-A-G-E-643
— 617 — 
spelling. Have weekly reviews of words found in previous les- 
sons. 
ARITHMETIC—Jones’ Practical, pages 7 to 114. Give fre- 
quent drills on the blackboard, and monthly reviews. Have at 
least two practical problems on the board each day involving 
fundamental processes. Stress neatness of work, accuracy and 
rapidity in all arithmetical operations. It is a good exercise to 
have occasional drills to promote rapidity and accuracy in hand- 
ling figures. 
LANGUAGE—Our Language, Second Book, pages 126 to 
234. Put special stress upon the sentences; nouns and verbs. 
Continue the composition and letter writing throughout the entire 
year. At least one composition should be required of pupils every 
week from now on through the eighth grade. The memorizing 
and interpretation of choice poems and prose should be continued, 
not only through this grade, but throughout the seventh and 
eighth as well. 
GEOGRAPHY—Frye’s Higher, pages 1 to 68, inclusive. 
Pay special attention to mathematical geography, continue map 
drawing. Teach thoroughly all the agencies that modify climate. 
Show how climate affects plant and animal life. Correlate geogra- 
phy and history, and ask such questions as, “Why did the French 
build a fort at the junction of the two rivers forming the Ohio?” 
“Why were forts erected at St. Louis, Memphis?” etc. Study 
Frye’s Manual for Teaching Geography. 
PHYSIOLOGY—Lippincott’s Book 2, completed. Make a 
special study of food and its digestion. The blood and the 
nervous system. Give frequent reviews on important topics of 
the book, making use of the questions given at the end of each 
chapter. 
VOCAL MUSIC—Continue simple songs, ear training and 
sight reading. 
SEVENTH YEAR.

course, the adopted text is sufficiently simple for it to be used 
profitably the last year of the grammar school, besides Civics can 
be effectively taught only in connection with the history of our 
country. 
NOTE—(1) Every school should have an unabridged dic- 
tionary and a library containings books suitable to all grades. 
(2) Since the State furnishes aid in the establishment of public 
school libraries, it is hoped that every school that has not a library 
at present will start a nucleus for one during the present year. 
For further information on this subject the teacher may address 
the State Superintendent, Nashville.

Below are given some suggestive daily programs for schoo! 
work, The programs are necessarily general in their nature; but 
it is hoped that they may be of service, especially to inexperienced 
teachers, in pointing out a general outline for daily work. 
The teacher should select the program given below best suited 
to her school and from it work out definitely the time to be given 
to each recitation, its place in the day’s work, etc. The daily pro- 
gram should be placed in a prominent place in the school room, 
and the work therein indicated should be carefully followed each 
day. 
The opening exercises, first given on the program, may consist 
of songs, devotional exercises, quotations, etc., and a few minutes 
each morning should be given to this period. If it is made in- 
teresting and instructive, it will act as an incentive and induce 
prompt attendance. 
Primary work follows next on the program on account of its 
importance. It follows every rest period during the day because 
the pupils have no books, and all work done in this class will be 
done in the recitation. The work should be made interesting and 
instructive and should be the preparation for the future studies 
of the pupils. 
Reading is placed next because it is the key to all other 
subjects and should occupy a prominent place on the program. 
Arithmetic, because of its universally recognized importance, 
should also occupy an important place, and for that reason is 
placed on the program, while the mind of the pupil is fresh. This 
is followed by physiology, because it is an interesting and com- 
paratively easy subject. : 
If any difference is made in the work periods of the day, the 
first forenoon period may be made some longer than the others, 
because more work can be accomplished in this period than in 
any other. 
After the morning rest we have placed the Primary work, 
after which is language and spelling, both of whiclr subjects re- 
quire considerable time, but are not regarded as difficult. 
Writing is placed the last thing in the morning because this 
perhaps is the best period that could be selected for this subject.

SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT. 
Mission: Better physical surroundings, good books for all, art 
in the school-room. 
Motto: Health, Comfort, Beauty, for our schools. 
The School Improvement movement, as a part of the great 
Southern movement, is a comparatively recent one in Tennessee. 
It was September 14, 1908, that I was employed by the Southern 
Education Board, through the Co-operative Education Associa- 
tion as State organizer of the school improvement work. We 
now have seven hundred and fifty School Improvement Asso- 
ciations, 
The first three months were spent in visiting the rural schools 
of three counties, namely: Sumner, Davidson and Knox. In 
each of these counties I organized from four to thirty-five School 
Improvement Associations, while others were organized by the 
County Superintendents. 
The first “Uniform Clean- -Up Day” was called in Sumner 
County on October 9, 1908. On this day schools were dismissed 
and the whole day given to a thorough cleaning of the houses 
and grounds by the teachers, pupils, parents and friends in the 
school communities. Since that time many counties in the State 
have followed the plan of the “Clean-Up Day.” As a means of 
reaching every school in the State, County School Improvement 
Associations, with branch or local School Improvement Associa- 
tions have been organized. 
There are now sixty County School Improvement Associa- 
tions with from five to forty-five branch associations in these 
counties. Madison County stands at the head of the list with 
the number of branch or local associations, it having forty-five, 
with three thousand members. Hamilton, Montgomery, White 
and Anderson rank next in the number of local School Improve- 
ment Associations. 
With the co-operation of the county superintendents, the offi- 
cers of the County School Improvement Associations, the school
-P-A-G-E-650
— 624 — 
boards, teachers and public-spirited citizens, this work is spread- 
ing into the most remote districts. 
In the summer of 1909 I visited twenty-four counties, or- 
ganizing both county and local School Improvement Associations. 
I have spoken at county and State teachers’ associations urging 
the teachers to organize local School Improvement Associations. 
In the summers of 1909-10 one thousand seven hundred 
teachers pledged themselves to organize local School Improve- 
ment Associations. During the “Whirlwind Education Cam- 
paign” in August and September, 1910, I went into twenty coun- 
ties, and the attention of more than twenty-five thousand citizens 
was called to the child’s environment as a very potent means of 
education. 
A special conference for the Middle Tennessee. School Im- 
provement workers was called at the State Capitol in the Senate 
Chamber on March 25, 1910. Inspiring reports were made by 
thirteen Presidents of county Schoo! Improvement Associations 
in Middle Tennessee, viz: 
(rt) -Cannon County—B. N. Barton, President County 
School Improvement Association. 
(2) Coffee County--W. B. Hamilton, President’ County 
School Improvement Association. 
(3) Cheatham County—Miss Willie Belle Pardue, Presi- 
dent County School Improvement Association. : 
(4) Franklin County--Miss Nora Hessey, President of 
County School Improvement Association. 
(5) Giles County—W. B. Moore, President of County 
School Improvement Association. 
(6) Lawrence County—Mrs. Myra N. Tandy, President of 
County School Improvement Association. 
(7) Maury County—W. P. Morton, President of County 
School Improvement Association. 
(8) Montgomery County—Mrs. Frank T. Hodgson, Presi- 
dent of County School Improvement Association. 
(9) Sumner County—Prof. P. T. Kerr, President of Coun- 
ty School Improvement Association. 
(10) Smith County—M. L. Caneer, President of County 
School Improvement. Association. :
-P-A-G-E-651

(11) White County—Thos. L. Passons, President of County 
School Improvement Association, 
(12) Wilson County—Miss Stella Shryer, President of 
County School Improvement Association. 
(13) Williamson County—Miss Nelle Shea, President of 
County School Improvement Association. 
In a round table discussion interesting and helpful experiences 
were given by local presidents. 
Superintendent R. L. Jones and Dr. P. P. Claxton gave 
helpful addresses at this conference. 
I have gone into the rural schools of the mountains valleys 
and plains—into the village, town and city schools. Personal 
visits mean much to me as well as to the community, but as I 
am field agent as well as my own secretary, my time will not per- 
mit going to many places I would like to visit personally, Funds 
for this work are also limited, as the Southern Education Board 
only agreed to contribute a portion of the expenses for the past 
year, while the rest must be raised in the State. By the sale of a 
school improvement button, which was suggested by Dr. P. P. 
Claxton, and which has on it our motto—Health, Comfort, Beau- 
ty for Our Schools—we hope to raise this fund. This button 
sells for 10 cents—s cents is kept for local improvements and 
§ cents sent to the Treasurer of the Co-Operative Education Asso- 
ciation or myself. 
In February, 1909, the first S. I. A. bulletin was published, 
with a very simple constitution for the County School Improve- 
ment Association and for the branch or local school improvement 
associations. In this same bulletin were suggestions for work 
that could be done by the committees. 
The purpose of the County School Improvement Association 
is: First, to foster interest in the improvement of all the public 
schools and educational life of the county, to secure longer terms 
for the schools, and a more regular and prompt attendance; to 
improve school houses and grounds by making them more health- 
ful, comfortable and beautiful, and to establish and maintain 
school libraries and to organize a local School Improvement Asso- 
ciation in every school and community in the county; to run a 
school improvement column in the local papers, where local S. 1.

— 626 — 
A. reports are printed or anything else that will aid the various 
committees-of the local associations. 
Each teacher should be a member of the county association, 
and anyone else may become a member. 
The officers of the County Association are a president, a 
vice-president, a treasurer and a secretary. These officers, with 
the County Superintendent of Schools, constitute the Executive 
Board of the association of the county. The place of all meetings 
4s determined by the Executive Board. Many of the County 
‘School Improvement Associations meet with the monthly teach- 
‘ers’ association.

-P-A-G-E-654
— 628 — 
Our chief aim in Tennessee for the past two years has been 
to get better physical surroundings, good books for all, and art 
in the school rooms and making the school house the social center. 
People of different political and religious view points have unit- 
ed in making the child’s environment a fit place for the child to 
spend the greater part of his life during this most impression- 
able time, the formative period. The members of the School 
Improvement Association are seeing the effect their work is hav- 
ing on the child now and know what it will mean in the life of 
the future citizen. 
SOME THINGS THE COMMITTEES HAVE ACCOM- 
PLISHED. 
THE HOUSE COMMITTEE, 
The House Committees have transformed bleak, bare, barn- 
like and dirty school houses into well ordered, clean and at- 
tractive school homes for the child to spend five days out of the 
seven, 
It has helped to create a sentiment for better architecture for 
the school, the rural school especially, and raised funds for 
building school houses. - 
Walls have been tinted cheery and restful tones. 
Comfortable furniture has been furnished, old furniture re- 
paired, repainted and varnished. Globes, maps, sand-tables and 
other equipment have been furnished. 
Strong shades and white curtains have been put at the win- 
dows. 
Window boxes and palms, ferns and blooming plants have 
been added to the school room. 
Stoves and pipes have been polished and repaired, and in 
in several hundred instances school rooms have added better heat- 
ing and ventilating systems. 
White covers have been supplied the teachers for their 
desks. 
Slate blackboards have been provided and old ones have been 
repainted. 
Cloak rooms and additional rooms have been provided.
-P-A-G-E-655
— 629 — 
Sanitary ComMITTEEs. 
Hundreds of schools, that were never scrubbed since the 
houses were built, have had frequent scrubbings. 
More thought is given to fresh air in the school room, by 
teachers, pupils and parents than ever before, and the jacketed 
stove with the fresh air shaft and foul air duct has been placed 
in many rural schools, thus changing the air around each child 
with the fresh heated air and keeping an even temperature over 
the entire room. 
Tale is taking the place of the dusty crayon, which is so-ir- 
ritating to the skin, eyes, ears, nose and throat of the child. 
Dampened sawdust or some floor cleaner is scattered before 
sweeping is done, and cloths are taking the place of the feather 
duster, and in a few places there are the push brooms and the 
vacuum sweepers. ; 
Oil is used in many places on the floor, but this is not en- 
couraged, as it is unsightly and is very hard on the child’s clothes. 
Where ‘it has thus far been impossible to get an improved 
heating and ventilating system, the rooms are systematically 
flushed with fresh air and boards are placed in the windows to 
avoid the draft; fresh air is admitted, the windows are also 
lowered from the top. 
Foot scrapers and door mats have been placed at schools that 
are at first a wonder to many children who never saw such a 
thing at a school house or at home. 
Drinking fountains have been added, covered water coolers 
with faucets and individual drinking cups are being used, even 
in rural schools. One teacher received word from some of the 
more ignorant parents to this effect: ‘My child is as good as 
you and I will not get him a separate cup.” 
Wells have been bored, old ones cleaned and encased with 
cement to keep out surface water. 
Many toilets have been built where there were none, and the 
conditions are being more carefully looked after. However, 
there is a needed campaign that must be made along this fine, 
The Board of Education of White County has promised to see 
that every school in that county has a sanitary closet before the 
opening of school in rg1t. This interest was aroused by Dr.
-P-A-G-E-656
— 630 — 
Breeding, who has charge of the hookworm campaign for White 
County. 
GrounD CoMMITTEES. 
In several instances larger grounds have been bought for the 
school property. 
Gullies have been filled, grounds have been graded, plowed 
and grass seed sowed, soil limed, cowpeas sowed to enrich the 
soil and then the ground has been sowed with grass seed. 
Hundreds of stumps have been removed, also rocks, brush 
and paper. 
Trees, shrubs, vines and perennial flowers have been planted 
on hundreds of school grounds. Grouping of trees and plants 
is encouraged rather than the nursery style of planting in rows. 
Walks of gravel, crushed stone and concrete have been made 
to the school houses and outbuildings. : 
Many school children have been made happy by the play- 
grounds being supplied with tennis, croquet, basket balls, sec- 
saws and acrobatic poles, as well as ample ball grounds being 
provided. 
A child is always willing and anxious to co-operate in mak- 
ing the school grounds beautiful and attractive when he sees his 
rights are regarded. 
A few school gardens have been started. 
FINANCE AND ENTERTAINMENT COMMITTEES, 
From September, 1909, to April, 1910, thirty-five thousand 
dollars was raised without any taxation whatever by the local S. 
I. A.’s for the improvement of the schools. 
Lectures are regularly held in many schools—both city, town 
and rural. 
Social evenings are enjoyed in many rural schools. 
Again social evenings for raising funds where candy and ice 
cream are sold, oyster stippers, box parties, Hallowe’en parties, 
old-time spelling matches are popular in some communities. 
Prizes are offered by the county president or other interested 
persons in some counties for the most improvement made along 
specified lines.
-P-A-G-E-657
— 631 — 
Lisrary COMMITTEES. 
Many schools worked for getting a library before State aid 
was given in 1909. Since then there has been a great awakening. 
(See special library report.) 
Many schools that did not have a dictionary or a reference 
book, now have a $40 or $60 library, with well selected books. 
that is an inspiration to the community as well as to the school. 
Art CoMMITTEES. 
Some schools have spent as much as $100 for pictures in one 
year. 
Statuaty and beautiful vases are in some schools. 
Thought is given to good prints and to the grading of the 
pictures, : 
Large and well-selected pictures, that can be enjoyed from 
every point in the room, are taking the place of small ones hung 
in criss-cross fashion. 
ATTENDANCE COMMITTEES. 
About nine hundred children have been placed in school 
through these committees, books and clothing being supplied in 
many cases. : 
Often the homes of indifferent parents are visited to encour- 
age them to keep their children in school. 
There are thirty-two counties under compulsory law, and by 
creating a great sentiment we can have a state compulsory law 
that will be enforced. 
MempersHip COMMITTEE. 
Through the active interest of this committee many have 
joined the school improvement associations. 
In many schools circular letters have been sent to former 
pupils, who become honorary members of the association, and 
have given as much as $20 for this honor. 
Many men of prominence have become honorary members 
of the School Improvement Association at the little school where 
they were once “barefoot boys.” This stimulates “the barefoot” 
boy of today.

The Mothers’ Associations of Knoxville were organized by 
Superintendent S. A. Mynders, one of the strongest members of 
the Co-Operative Education Association. There are eleven asso- 
ciations, with a membership of 500. The object of these asso- 
ciations is to co-operate with the city school officials and in- 
structors for better educational advantages and a closer sym- 
pathy and co-operation between the home and school. They have 
accomplished wonderful results. (A detailed report can be had

PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
NasHvILte, TENN., September 10, 1909. 
To School Officials and Teachers: 
This office has prepared a booklet containing a large list of 
library books, approved by the State Board of Education, in ac- 
_ cordance with Section 6, Chapter 264, of the Acts of 1909. The 
success or failure of the library movement depends upon the co- 
operation of school officials and teachers. There is no community 
- so poor that it is not able to assist in establishing and maintaining 
a school library. In fact, the poorer the community, the greater 
the necessity for a public library. In homes of wealth a fairly 
large list of books suitable to the wants of the child may be 
found, but in the homes of the poor the list is very limited ; hence 
it is the function of the school library to furnish alike books to 
children, regardless of the reading material that may be found in 
the home. Under the provisions of the Act referred to above 
there will be about ten thousand dollars ($10,000) a year fur- 
nished by the State to assist in establishing public school libraries. 
Whether that amount is used or not depends entirely on the school 
officials and teachers. The State will give one-half as much for 
the library as the community will raise. It is hoped that the 
entire amount appropriated by the State will be taken up for li- 
brary use during the year. I most earnestly urge the hearty sup- 
port of all school people in the promotion of library work in the 
public schools of Tennessee. 
. Sincerely yours, 
R. L. Jones, 
State Superintendent. 
PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARY LAW. 
Section 6, Chapter 264, of the Acts of 1909, provides: 
“That one per cent of the General Education Fund provided 
by this Act shali be used to encourage and assist in the establish-
-P-A-G-E-673
— 647 — 
ment and maintenance of libraries in the public schools as herein 
provided. 
“Whenever the patrons and friends of any public school in 
any county of the State shall raise by private subscription or 
otherwise and tender to the County Trustee, through the County 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, the sum of twenty dollars 
($20) or more for the establishment and maintenance of a library 
for that school, said County Superintendent shall notify the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and, upon the certificate of 
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Comptroller 
of the Treasury shall pay to the Trustee of said county, out of the 
fund herein provided, a sum equal to half that raised by private 
subscription or otherwise, to be added to the library fund of said 
school; and whenever ten dollars ($10) or more shall be raised 
by private subscription or otherwise to supplement a library al- 
ready established under the provisions of this section of this Act, 
said library may in like manner receive from the fund herein 
provided a sum equal to half the sum so raised. 
“Provided, that no school shall receive in any one year from 
this fund more than twenty dollars ($20) for the establishment 
of a new library, or more than ten dollars ($10) to assist in sup- 
plementing a library already established. 
“Provided, further, that in distributing the funds under the 
provisions of this section of this Act preference shall be given to 
applications coming from counties which have not previously re- 
ceived their proportionate part of this fund according to scholas- . 
tic population. 
“And provided, further, that preference shall be given to ap- 
plications for assistance to establish new libraries rather than ap- 
plications to assist in supplementing libraries already estab- 
lished. ‘ . 
“It shall be the duty of the State Board of Education to make 
and cause to be published through the office of the State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction rules and regulations for libraries 
established under the provisions of this section of this Act, issue 
approved lists of books from which purchases for said libraries 
may be made with money received from the State as herein pro- 
vided; and arrange for the purchase of such books at the lowest 
possible prices. All libraries receiving assistance from this fund
-P-A-G-E-674
— 648 — 
shall comply with all the regulations made by the State Board of 
Education, as herein provided. All money received from the 
State to assist in establishing or supplementing a library under 
the provisions of this section shall be used to purchase books on 
the approved lists aforesaid, and no books shall be purchased at 
a higher price than the price in said approved lists. All pur- 
chases of books shall be reported to the County Superintendent, 
and a list of the same shall be attached to the warrant issued in 
payment of the same; and no commission shall be allowed the 
County Trustee on library funds. 
“One-fifth of the amount accruing annually for school li- 
braries under the provisions of this Act may be used for the pur- 
chase and maintenance of circulating libraries for the public 
schools of the State under the joint direction of the State Li- 
brary and the Department of Public Instruction.” 
NOTES. 
1. The law contemplates that each rural school in the State 
shall ultimately have a public school library, but the framers of 
the law very wisely placed a proviso that every community must 
do something for itself before the State will make any appropria- 
tion for a library. This proviso is both wise and just, for the 
community that will not do something toward securing a library 
would neither appreciate nor use one if provided wholly by the 
State. 
2. The community must raise as much as $20 for the estab- 
lishment and maintenance of a new library, or as much as $10 
for the purpose of supplementing a library already established, 
before the State will give aid; but the State will give one-half as 
much as the community; provided, that no one school shall re- 
ceive more than $20 in a single year for the establishment of a 
new library, or $10 for supplementing a library already estab- 
lished. 
3. Whenever the community or any public spirited citizen or 
citizens of the community will give as much as $20 to a new li- 
brary, or $10 to supplement a library already established, ‘this 
amount shall be turned over to the County Superintendent, who 
will place the same in the hands of the Trustee to the credit of
-P-A-G-E-675
— 649 — 
the school. The County Superintendent will then notify the 
State Superintendent that a certain school in his county has 
raised so much money for a school library, and that he has de- 
posited the same with the County Trustee; whereupon the State 
Superintendent shall issue a certificate upon the Comptroller of 
the Treasury, who will pay to the Trustee of the county, out of the 
State Library Fund, a sum equal to half that raised by private 
subscription or otherwise; provided, as sated above, that no one 
county in any one year shall receive more than $20 for the es- 
tablishment of a new library nor more than $10 to assist in sup- 
plementing a library already established. 
4. All libraries receiving assistance from the fund provided 
by the State must select books from the within approved list pre- 
pared by the State Board of Education. All purchases of books 
shall be reported to the County Superintendent, and a list of the 
same shall be attached to the warrant drawn by him upon the 
County Trustee for the entire library fund placed to the credit of 
the school. : 
Your County Superintendent will furnish blanks for ordering 
library books, and also a list of approved books, on application ; 
and it will expedite matters if the teacher or party selected by 
the local community to order the books will give to the County 
Superintendent a duplicate order of the library books at the time 
. they deposit with him the amount the community has raised to be 
placed in the hands of the Trustee to the credit of their school. 
THE VALUE OF THE LIBRARY. 
It is a recognized fact that at certain periods of a child’s life 
certain phases of literature appeal to it. If the kind of literature 
that appeals to the child is placed in his hands, he will read it, be- 
cause it feeds his hungering soul. By furnishing the proper read- 
ing matter to the young, the reading habit is thus early and per- 
manently fixed, and a taste for good, wholesome literature is 
formed. 
The library, if properly used, will exert a wholesome influence 
in the home. The parent and other members of the family will 
often read the books with interest and profit. 
The reading, if properly directed by the teacher, will also help
-P-A-G-E-676
— 650 — 
the pupil with his regular studies, If all the children are to be 
supplied with good literature, the school should be the distribut- 
ing point for all the best books published. 
HOW COMMUNITIES MAY RAISE THE LIBRARY 
FUND. 
1. By locai subscription. Almost every one is willing to con- 
tribute something for a library in which the whole community is 
permitted to share, if the matter is only properly presented. 
2. By explaining to the people the operation of the library law, 
showing that the State will help those who are willing to help 
themselves. 
3. By entertainments given by the pupils. (Have the pupils 
sell the tickets before the evening of the entertainment.) 
4. By giving ice cream festivals, box suppers, ete., and turn- 
ing the proceeds into the library fund. 
5. By leading the community to see the value of a library. 
6. By having a “book reception day” set apart one evening for 
receiving the patrons and friends of the school. Let the school 
serve tea and the invited friends contribute a library book select- 
ed from the approved list. 
THE USE OF THE LIBRARY. 
It is more difficult to use the library intelligently than it is to 
raise the money with which to purchase the books. 
1. The teacher should know both the book and the child in 
order to direct the reading intelligently. 
2. Never command that a certain book should be read, but 
rather tell a story found in the book or in some artful way arouse 
the pupil’s interest to where he will voluntarily read. 
3. If a pupil reads a book of his own volition, you may rest 
assured he understands in a measure its contents and is interested 
in it. Therefore, it is well not to be too strict in confining pupils 
to reading books supposed to be suited only for a certain grade. 
4. Promote among the pupils a discussion of the relative 
merits of the books they have read. Quite often pupils are in-
-P-A-G-E-677
— 651 — 
fluenced more by the opinion of their fellows than by the opinion 
of their teacher. 
5. Ask the pupil questions about the contents of the book read, 
and ‘ascertain his point of view in determining its value. 
6. With pupils in the higher grade, suggest parallel reading 
that bears directly on their class work. 
7. Do not permit the book to lie idly on the shelf. If good 
books are worn out by careful use, they have served their pur- 
pose well. - 
8. For the protection and preservation of the books, the local 
Board of Education should purchase out of the school fund a 
good, durable bookcase. 
Poole & Isley, 16 Trinity Avenue, Atlanta, Ga., submitted 
the lowest bid for furnishing the library books. Address all or- 
ders to them. 
The General Education Bill provided that one-fifth the 
amount accruing annually for school libraries, under the pro- 
vision of said act, may be used for the purchase and mainten- 
ance of circulating libraries for the public schools of the State 
under the joint direction of the State Library and the Department 
of Public Instruction, 
Acting under the provisions of the above, the following 
libraries have been purchased and are in circulation in the fol- 
lowing counties : 
Six libraries of 50 volumes each, Anderson County. 
Six libraries of 50 volumes each, Fayette County. 
Six libraries of 50 volumes each, Carter County. 
Six libraries of 50 volumes each, Henry County. 
Two libraries of 50 volumes each, Hickman County. 
Six libraries, of 50 volumes each, Rhea County.” 
Thus making a total of thirty-two circulating libraries with 
sixteen hundred volumes now in use. This number will be in- 
creased from time to time to meet the growing demand for li- 
braries.

The County Superintendents should give one forty-minute pe- 
riod to each subject at each County Institute, organizing the pri- 
mary teachers into one class, and the secondary teachers into. an-— 
other. The best talent the county can command should be called 
into service to instruct these classes, and instead of selecting a 
different teacher for each monthly meeting, the instructor should 
be selected for the year. The study of these subjects will be con- 
tinued in the State and County Institutes. No teacher can master 
these texts in a few days, hence all are urged to secure the books : -

STATEMENT OF THE State Text-Book COMMISSION. 
In selecting text-books for use in the public schools for the 
State, the Text-Book Commission has had before it a carefully 
prepared report of the sub-commission, which was composed of 
able and practical school men, selected by reason of their experi- 
ence in ‘school work. 
In addition to the recommendations in this report, the mem- 
bers of the commission have spent considerable time making in- 
dividual examination of the books, and in joint session with the 
sub-commision have heard discussed, by the representatives of 
the various. publishers, the relative merits of all books sub- 
mitted. 
In reaching a decision as to the value and suitability of the 
various books, we have availed ourselves of all the information 
accessible. In some cases books were offered in cloth and board 
binding, and im other cases in special or abridged editions, but 
only regular editions.in good cloth binding. were considered.
-P-A-G-E-731
It was the policy of this commission to adopt a whole, rather 
than a split series of texts, as an author of a series of books has. 
a definite plan in view, and a change from one author to another 
breaks the continuity and usually results in loss of time and prog- 
ress to the pupil. A number of books’ now in use have been 
changed, but no change has been made without good reason, and 
we believe that the gain in the character of the books will out- 
weigh the slight increase in cost of making the exchange. While 
every effort has been made to save expense, this has not been 
done at the sacrifice of merit. 
The total cost of books of the present adoption is less than the 
total cost of adoption of five years ago, and the commission: be- 
lieves that the quality of the books has been very greatly im- 
proved upon. 
No time nor pains have been spared in duly considering all 
books submitted, and in case of every change that was made the 
book adopted was taken from the highest class as found in the 
report of the sub-commission. 
In making our selections, we have had in mind the best inter- 
ests of the children of the State, and, all things considered, the 
commission feels satisfied with its work, and presents its results 
with confidence that it will meet the approval of the people.

publishers at Memphis, Clarksville, Chattanooga, and Cooke-

“ The law provides that “there shall be maintained in each 
‘county in-the State, provided the commission shall deem it ad- 
‘visable and so demand, not less than one nor more than four 
agencies for the distribution of the books to the patrons, or the 
contractor shall be permitted to make arrangements with mer- 
chants or others for the handling or distribution of the books.” 
There is not less than one book dealer in any county: andin 
some counties there are seven and eight, the number of dealers

depending on the size and topography of the county; but in the 
event there is no local dealer within convenient distance, any 
patron may order books from one.of the depositories, and_ the 
book or books so ordered shall be sent to his postoffice address, 
freight, express, postage, or other charges prepaid at the retail 
contract price, provided the price of the book-so ordered shall 
be paid in advance. All books shall be sold to the consumer at 
the retail contract price, and in each book shall be printed the 
following: “The price fixed hereon is fixed by State contract 
and any deviation therefrom shall be reported to your County 
Superintendent of Public Instruction or the State Superintendent 
at Nashville.” . 
EXCHANGE, 
Any text-book in use in the public schools of the State, which’ 
will be evidenced by the book’s containing the proper imprint 
showing that it was a State adopted book, and is in use when the 
newly adopted text-book goes into effect, may be exchanged for 
an adopted book of like grade. To illustrate: A primary geog- 
raphy may be exchanged for a primary geography and an ad- 
vanced geography for an advanced geography, etc.. Where a 
three-book series takes the place of a two-book seriés, as in 
the case of the language and grammar, the text of the two-book 
series will be accepted in exchange for the text of the three- 
book series for use in the corresponding grade. To illustrate : 
In some ‘schools Hyde’s Language was used in the third, fourth, 
and fifth grades, and Sewell’s Grammar was used in the sixth, 
severith, and eighth grades. McMurray and Norvell’s Language, 
Book'I., will be used in the third and fourth grades hence, the 
Hyde ‘Language may be exchanged for MeMurray and Norvell’s 
Book T,.Our Language, Book II. (Smith) will be used in the 
sixth grades; hence, either the Hyde Language or the 
it-Grammar could be used in exchange for Smith’s Lan- 
guage, Book II. Sewell’s Grammar would be used in exchange 
Language Grammar (Smith), which will be used in 
en and eight.

and shall have beem in actual use in some school of this State. 
The book will be received by the merchant at exchange price, 
regardless of how badly it may be mutilated, provided such book 
could have been used in the school as a text. 
The time of making the exchange is extended to September 
I, 1910. All schools that are now in session or may be in session 
before September 1, 1909, will be permitted to use the present 
books till the close of the term or scholastic year if they so de- 
- sire. Since it is always demoralizing to change books in the mid- 
dle of a school term, we would advise that all schools that open 
before September Ist use the books now on hand until the close 
of the scholastic term, and that the new books be introduced only 
as subjects are completed or as classes are promoted. If, how- 
ever, the scholastic year is divided into two terms, the exchange 
may be made at the beginning of the second term without injury 
to the best interest of the school. 
Please explaitr fully the method of making the exchange to- 
your teachers and patrons, so that the exchange of books may be 
made with as little trouble to the patrons as possible and without 
in any way disturbing the school organization. 
We ask the cordial support of all friends of education in: 
putting in effect the new adoption. 
Respectfully, 
R. L, Jones, 
State Superintendent.

Superintendent Harned asked that his subject be deferred - 
until Wednesday, which was granted. 
Under the general topic, “Tennessee’s Educational Needs,” 
Professor A. E. Darrah, of Chattanooga, read an interesting 
paper on High Schools, and was followed in discussion by Pro- 
fessor J. C. Mitchell, of Decherd, and Professor J. H. Bayer, 
of Huntingdon. 
Dr. Brown Ayres of the University of Tennessee, made an

‘ 
WepbnEspay, January 13, 1909. 
The morning session was opened with prayer by Superin- 
tendent W. E. Stephens. 
“The first subject, “Better School Supervision,” was called, 
and the leading paper was read by Superintendent Fred J. Page, 
of Franklin. This was followed by talks by J. T. Reynolds, of 
Fayetteville; P. L. Harned, Clarksville; S. E. Hill, Knoxville; 
L..E, Summers, Crossville; J. L. Hair, St. Elmo, and G. C. . 
Simmons, Lynchburg. 
‘President Frazier next introduced Superintendent S. A. 
Mynders, of Knoxville, and former State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction. Professor Mynders did not, however, speak 
on this subject, but asked to be permitted to follow Miss Virginia 
P.Moore in her excellent address on “How Community Organi- 
May Promote School Interests,” following the same line 
fouglit as taken by her. Miss Moore’s address was one of   
 
-P-A-G-E-740
— 714 — 
_ the features of the morning, being an excellent one, abounding in 
sound, practical observations and helpful suggestions. Pro- 
fessor Mynders then took up the theme where she left off, and 
followed with an able talk along the same line. 
‘State Superintendent R. L. Jones made an able address on 
“Educational Progress,” at the close of which Superintendent 
P. L. Harned offered the following resolution, which was sec- 
onded by Superintendent S. A. Mynders, and after some dis- 
cussion unanimously passed : 
Wuenreas, There is a disposition on the part of a few counties 
to repeal the law establishing a county system of public schools 
* in Tennessee, which disposition results from the failure of such 
county to carry out the purpose of the law; and, 
Wuereas, We regard the enactment of the county system 
two years ago as one of the most advanced steps Tennessee ever 
took in public school education and that its repeal would be a 
’ calamity to the public school; therefore, 
Resolved, That we, the Public School Officers of Tennessee, 
assembled, do most earnestly protest against the change of our 
school system back to the old district plan, and urge that no such 
step be taken, pledging our best efforts to the faithful service 
under the County Boards of the State. 
Major A. W. Wills and Mr. L. W. Lettin, Postmaster and 
Assistant Postmaster of Nashville, made instructive talks on 
' “The Importance of a Better Knowledge of Postal Regulations,” 
and the Association adjourned until the afternoon session. 
AFTERNOON. 
The afternoon session of the Association was called to order 
at 2 o’clock by President Frazier. 
The first subject discussed was “Domestic Science,” the first 
talk on this subject being by Miss E. Randall, of Nashville. 
Miss Randall began by explaining the necessity of a thorough 
mastery of domestic science, declaring that it meant not only 
cooking, but the proper performance of all household duties. 
The failure of the average woman to keep abreast of the changes 
in the best domestic and social life was given as one of the 
reasons: why the mother in the home has little opportunity of
-P-A-G-E-741
715 — 
training the children in domestic science, besides not having the 
time for careful training on this subject... Cooking, said the 
speaker, is a noble work, and should be studied at greater length 
than in one or two lessons a week. The proper teaching of 
domestic science enabled the pupil to receive training in many 
other things than the mere preparation of foods. Miss Randall’s 
talk was received with applause. : 
Dr. Ayres expressed his pleasure at the soundness of Miss 
Randall’s argument, and declared domestic science was one of 
the most important subjects. in the training of women, for the 
majority of women are intended by God to be home-makers. Dr. 
Ayres explained at length the incorporation.of an elaborate 
system of home economics in the University of Tennessee, and 
said the study of home economics should stand on an equal 
basis with Latin or Greek or any other subject. 
Professor Josiah Main, of Knoxville, a member of the téach- 
ing force of the Agricultural Experiment Station at Knoxville, 
next addressed the Association in a very interesting paper on 
“Agricultural Education.” The significance of “punic faith” 
was learnedly enlarged upon, and the industrial problems of the 
present day were declared to be among those soon to be solved 
. by. the proper training of the citizens in advanced industrial edu- 
cation. Citizenship was declared to be the prime purpose of 
the school, and particularly of the industrial school. Professor 
Main. was particularly urgent that the revision of education 
should be left to the hands of its friends, as “man always de- 
stroys that which he does not understand.” The goal of the 
agricultural education was declared to be better, higher citizen- 
ship; and increasing nourishment, health and happiness. 
Dr. J. A. Albright, Secretary of the State Board of Health, 
ext introduced by State Superintendent Jones, and in turn 
troduced Dr. Louis Leroy, of Memphis, whose recent work 
st tuberculosis has given him national prominence... Dr. 
took up at length the effects of the anti-tuberculosis cam- 
and the outlook. 
speaker gave a brief, but highly interesting, resume , of 
re of tuberculosis and the work that has recently. been 
zainst the dread disease. He showed that the tubercle 
ht attack any organ or part of the body, and that the     
   
   
     
       
  
-P-A-G-E-742
— 716 — 
ravages of the disease are by no means confined to the’ lungs. 
He told of the things that tend to make the body suitable soil 
for the bacilli, and declared that the popular notion of liability 
to the disease through heredity was only to a certain extent true, 
The liability, he said, was more noticeable from grandfather to 
grandchild than from father to child. Occupation was declared 
to be one of the conditions most responsible for the contraction 
of the disease, as occupation always affects limitation of respira- 
tion. : 
“The death rate in the cities,” declared Dr. Leroy, “is greater 
than the birth rate, among negroes, and the negro problem will 
in time solve itself if the ravages of tuberculosis among the 
members of that race continue as at present.” 
Among the causes of the prevalence of tuberculosis were men- 
tioned impure milk, careless expectoration, a lack of fresh air, 
etc. Dr. Leroy declared that pulmonary tuberculosis might be 
contracted through the intestinal tract. Early recognition of 
the disease was mentioned as one of the main things essential 
to a cure, and the idea that it is necessary to go “out West” is 
not so well established as the necessity of going “out doors.” 
It was declared that tuberculosis patients who sleep on the fire 
escapes of the tenements of New York do as well or better than 
those who go “out West.” The speaker condemned patent medi- 
cines and cough syrups. 
The increase of playgrounds was one of the things mentioned 
by the speaker as one of the chief reforms needed. Physical 
culture in the public schools, better ventilation, less careless 
spitting, better medical supervision, segregation of tubercular 
children were urged. “We must pay some attention, too, to the 
help in our homes. This is a great problem in Tennessee. Every 
day I see servant girls who are suffering from tuberculosis.” Dr. 
Leroy’s address was greeted with great applause. 
The subject of manual arts was next taken up, Professor 
D. Moore Andrews, of Nashville, being the first speaker. He 
urged the adoption of a course in manual arts in every school 
in the State, and declared that the question of discipline in the 
schools might be largely simplified by encouraging the training 
of pupils in manual arts. He gave an example to show where 
in one instance a boy who had formerly been unruly was made a
-P-A-G-E-743
— 717 — 
splendid pupil by being afforded proper activities in manual 
training. Prof. Andrews urged the adoption of courses in manual 
arts in every school in Tennessee. 
Superintendent Sidney G. Gilbreath, of Chattanooga, next

dent Frazier have carefully considered the same in detail. They

The Committee on Resolutions submitted the following 1 re- 
port, which was adopted: 
The Committee on Resolutions of the Public School Officers’ 
Association of Tennessee submits for consideration and recom- 
mend for adoption the following resolutions: 
First—That we heartily approve the educational policy of 
Superintendent Robert L. Jones, and that we pledge his’ admin- 
istration our hearty and active support. 
Second—That the thanks of this Association are due and are 
hereby tendered Hon. Fred B. Frazier for the fair, impartial and 
able manner in which he has discharged the duties of his posi- 
tion and that the thanks of the Association be voted Superintend- 
ent, P. L. Harned and Mr. Claude J. Bell for their efficient labors 
as Secretaries. 
' Third—Believing that the most progressive reform of recent 
years was the enactment of the County Board of Education law, 
we urge its continuance on the statutes and pledge to its enforce- 
ment our best energies, and ask that it be extended to every 
county in the State.. : 
Fourth—The one greatest need of the public schools is for 
properly trained and equipped teachers for the rural primary 
schools. To meet this imperative need normal schools should be 
provided and we recommend and earnestly urge that the present 
General Assembly provide for the establishment and support of 
three normal schools for white teachers and one for colored 
teachers, to be under the direction and control of the State Board 
of Education.
-P-A-G-E-745
— 719° — 
Fifth—-We again pledge our support to the’University of 
Tennessee, and recommend the passage of the bills now intro- 
_ duced looking to the reorganization of its Board. of Trastees and 
to its more liberal support. 
   
    Sixth—We congratulate Chancellor Porter < of 
College for Teachers on his honorable and succe dministra- 
tion, and urge that the Legislature, by appropri legislation, 
guarantee to the College the long+ Promised donation from the 
Peabody Educational Fund. 
Seventh—We recommend legislation that will secure efficient 
supervision of the rural schools and provide just and reasonable 
compensation for county Superintendents; for legislation that 
wilt encourage the establishment of County .High.Schools in 
every county in the State; and for legislation that will assist in 
the establishment and support of school libraries.   
That we call special attention to the recommendation made _ 
by Superintendent Jones in his very able address that school . 
property should be provided for by special fund, bond issue or 
otherwise, in order that school terms may not be shortened or 
teachers’ salaries lessened. 
That we again record our approval of the enactment of a com- 
pulsory school attendance law, that. children may ‘be protected 
against the ignorance of their parents, and that their tight to 
intellectiial al liberty may be assured and preserved. :

By special order, State Superintendent R. L. Jones delivered 
an address on “The Strength and Weakness of Public Schools.” 
In substance he said: 
“TE don’t think I have ever seen an Association which has 
accomplished so much, Each of you who has spoken has talked 
on your problems, and I hope you will solve them. 
“Some years ago we were humiliated that we could not levy 
a-school tax. For twenty years we fought for this, and that we 
did not get what we wanted should be a matter of pleasure. 
We now have a unit system, and we have got to fight to retain 
this.. Legislators are constantly introducing bills to defeat this 
system. 
“The district system is all wrong, for it produces bad results, 
and the county unit is the only feasible plan we can now work 
upon. 
“If any man is sclling out our schools, the wrong should. be 
corrected. I know of one case of this kind, where other men 
laid the power in one man’s hand. If any of you Superintendents
-P-A-G-E-752
— 726 — 
know of any member doing this, notify me; 1 will bring im- 
peachment proceedings. 
“In the selection of Superintendents we are strong; in-paying 
them, we are weak. In Alabama, the man who gets the most 
_votes.is chosen, regardless of qualifications. As to pay .in this 
State, there will be a better day for the Superintendents, for a 
law. may soon become effective making the minimum salary $700. 
“There are about forty-five counties that have levied a high 
school tax, and if you will go to work right, by the end of the 
April term of court we will have seventy-five counties in line. 
“It is the people you must look to, even when the County 
Courts have acted favorably. They will deal justly by you if 
you will deal candidly by them. You must gauge your County 
Court, too. 
“Another thing we need is strong leadership. . Our organiza- 
tion means much toward this end. Next year I am going to 
write every County Court to pay your expenses to this Associa- 
tion. 
“We must, for the most part, do commonplace work. Of 
our country there are ninety-five per cent doing commonplace 
work: We cannot all go into the professions, so. some of us 
will have to hew wood and draw water. With this condition, 
We must reconstruct our school system in order that all classes 
may receive benefit. 
“T want to give you an argument for a higher school tax. 
In an eight-months’ term for eight years the course can be com- 
- pleted. In many places schools are open only four, five or six 
months, and a child cannot do eight months’ work in six. You 
are robbing children by compelling them to do oné year’s. work 
in two years.” 
At the close of this address the committee reports were re- 
ceived just prior to the election of new officers. 
Election of all officers was made by single nomination and 
acclamation, with the following result: 
S. G. Gilbreath, Chattanooga, President. 
W. C. Anderson, Nashville, Vice-President. 
P. L. Harned, Clarksville, Secretary-Treasurer.

President Gilbreath was escorted to the chair, and in a a brief 
address stated that he was planning for some improvements next 
year. Principal among these was to get better railroad rates 
to the Association meeting, and to secure a larger attendance. 
Chattanooga extended an invitation to hold the next sessiori 
in that city, but on account of the Constitution fixing the place 
of meeting in Nashville, the invitation could not be accepted.

beloved State Superintendent, Hon. R. L. Jones. As the head 
of our State school system he has earned the esteem and loyalty 
of the teachers of the State and we believe his good works will 
follow him. A man of the people, he has justified popular ex- 
pectation in the discharge of the arduous duties of his high office. 
We congratulate him on his past administration and pledge him 
our full confidence and support for the future, believing that 
generations of children to come will be his debtors. 
IV. That we desire to express our appreciation to the office 
force of the Department of Education, Chief Clerk, A. L. Todd, 
Miss Hayes and Miss Stroud for courtesies extended to the 
Association during this session.

the city for their kindness and courtesy in publishing full ac- 
counts of our proceedings and we recognize the power of the 
State in furthering the cause of public education. 
VI. We return our thanks to our retiring officers for the 
zeal and efficiency with which they have carried on the affairs 
‘of the Association, and especially to our efficient President, Sup- 
erintendent Wharton S. Jones, do we express our appreciation 
of the efficient manner in which he has presided over our meet- 
ing, and of the words of wisdom in his address before our body, 
and to our efficient Secretaries, Superintendent P. L. Harned, 
and Mr. Claude J. Bell. 
VII. That we appreciate the invitation of Dr. J. I. D. Hinds 
to visit the Peabody College for Teachers and hope that Ten- 
nessee may be privileged to have the valuable services of that 
institution permanently within its borders.

“In the absence of Dr. Allen G. Hall, L. F. Chapmari welcomed 
the teachers in behalf of the Monteagle-Assembly. Mr. Chap- 
man expressed the wish that this meeting of the Association 
might do the teachers more géod than any previous meeting, and 
said that the highest compliment that could be paid to the Mont- 
eaglé Assembly was that they should be remembered pleasantly. 
Mr. J. L. Brooks, of Covington, in behalf of the teachers of 
West Tennessee, responded to the address of welcome in the place 
of Wharton S. Jones, who was ‘unavoidably kept away. He said 
it rested with the teachers of the State as to whether our children 
shall be as well trained as those of other States. He congratu- 
lated the Tennessee teachers on the splendid work they have 
already done. 
‘The response for Middle Tennessee to the address of wel- 
come was delivered by Prof. R. K. Morgan, of Fayetteville. 
His address was thoughtful and forceful, “the improvement of 
man” being the central thought in his address, saying that “thé 
méssage you deliver is what counts.” 
‘Professor W. E. Stephens, of Dayton, took the place of 
Professor J. B. Brown, of Chattanooga, in the responses, ably 
representing the Eastern part of the State. — 
Following these greetings, Vice-President S. H. Proffit took 
the chair and President W. N. Billingsly delivered the Annual 
Address, “The Next Step—What Shall It Be?” He suggested 
. thatthe. next step devolving upon the teacher be a period of 
ruction, such as houses, libraries, school furniture, a mild — 
tilsory school law, a law enabling counties to issue-bonds for 
ig modern school buildings and preparing suitable grounds.

THURSDAY MORNING, JULY 15, 1909. 
The third day’s session opened with prayer by Rev. W. P. 
Bone, of Lebanon. 
Dr. J. I. D. Hinds read a very able paper on the “Progress 
of Simplified Spelling.” The address aroused the interest of 
the teachers and a number took part in the general discussion 
which followed. 
Superintendent R. L. Jones was given second place on the 
program, and in a very able way discussed the “Progress of
-P-A-G-E-763
— 737 — 
Education During the Last Two Years.” He said that we had 
muuch to feel encouraged over, -but there is much to be done yet, 
and he urged the teachers to unite their efforts and work for 
one thing, because in this way only he felt we had been able 
to accomplish so much. , 
J. L. Brooks, Chairman of Committee on President’s Address, 
made the report for the committee and it was unanimously 
adopted. 
A change in the morning’s program came just here, when - 
Professor J. B. Brown, of Chattanooga, called State Superin- 
tendent R. L. Jones to the platform and presented a very hand- 
some loving cup to him and a costly cut-glass. vase to Mrs. Jones. 
In presenting the cup, Professor J. B. Brown said: 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen—It becomes a very 
pleasant duty for me to take part in the exercises of this hour 
in which we are to pay tribute to the worth of one of our noblest 
characters, a man who through his broad intellect, indomitable 
courage and energy, loyalty to every duty, unswerving fidelity 
to his friends, tactfulness in dealing with all men, together with 
his high sense of honor and justice has endeared himself to every 
teacher and patron of the public schools of the State. 
Born in one of the obscure mountain counties of the State, 
the academy and college gave him his education. He climbed 
from the position of a teacher in a rural school to first rank and 
later became one of the most efficient County Superintendents, 
and indeed it was this very efficiency that lost him to the county 
for the greater work of the State. With his record as State 
Superintendent ‘we are all familiar, but I feel that there are few 
who comprehend fully the magnitude of the difficulties this man 
has had to face—difficulties which had been of long standing— 
hiridrances to the educational development in the State of Ten- ~ 
and which demanded of the man who would conquer 
them a giant’s. grasp of the situation and an almost superhuman 
‘degree-of tact. That he possessed the qualities necessary for the 
ion. of the situation is attested by the recent educational 
pment and advancement in our State. The enactment of 
tiny Board of Education Law and the General Education 
to.a law will mark an epoch in the progress of education 
        
    
-P-A-G-E-764
— 738 — 
He is universally esteemed by all the teachers of the State, 
but the feeling that they have for him as compared with the 
devotion of those who by force of circumstances know him best 
is vain and. indeed insignificant. 
’ Now, Superintendent Jones, I have the very great pleasure 
of presenting to you on behalf of the teachers of Tennessee, 
this loving cup. Inscribed upon it is the following: 
“Presented to Hon. R. L. Jones, State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, by the teachers of Tennessee as: a token of 
respect. and esteem for his excellent services in behalf of better 
education. July 15, 1909.” 
Esteem it not. for its value, but because it is filled with love 
and best wishes for your continued success and happiness. 
Superintendent Jones responded as follows: 
Mr. Brown, Ladies and Gentlemen—I appreciate this token 
of friendship and esteem more than I can express. However, 
no token presented on the part of the teachers of Tennessee is 
needed to convince me of the loyalty to me or the cause of 
education of the teaching force of the State. You have stood 
by me and have stood by the schools in every pressing stage and 
in every important step that we have undertaken. I hope that 
through all your life your endeavors will be rewarded and that 
your happiness and prosperity will be commensurate with your 
loyalty and devotion to the public schools of Tennessee. 
I assure you I shall never be the recipient of any present I 
shall appreciate more than this cup, presented by my friends 
and co-workers. I sincerely thank you. 
Professor Brown, turning to Mrs. Jones, spoke as follows: 
Now in paying tribute to our worthy State Superintendent 
we have not been unmindful of that one who has at all times 
shared with him in his discouragements and trials and has re- 
joiced with him in his triumphs. .It now becomes my great 
pleasure to present to you, Mrs. Jones, on the part of the teachers 
_of the State this vase as a token of their respect and esteem for 
you, the wife of him whom we love to honor. 
Mrs. Jones tesponded as follows: 
Mr. President and Members of the Association—I am not a 
speaker and cannot express my feelings in words that will. tell
-P-A-G-E-765
—.739 — 
you. how much I appreciate. the friends of Mr. Jones and this 
token of their love and appreciation. I-assure you I shall al- 
ways prize it and shall ever hold in grateful remembrance the 
kind and loyal friends that presented it. . . 
-The regular program was then taken up and Dr. David 
Spence Hill, of Nashville, read a very interesting paper on the 
“Faults of Children.” This address appears in full in the pro- 
ceedings of this meeting. 
- The Memorial Committee made its report through the Chair- 
man, Mr. A. C. Webb, of Nashville. The report was adopted. 
‘C. B. Ijams, Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions, 
made the report for the committee and it was also adopted.

The Secretary read a letter from Mr. Claude J. Bell in which 
he expressed regret that he was unable to attend the State Teach- 
ers’ Association at this time, but was kept away on account of 
the illness of his wife. He sent his good wishes to the Associa- 
tion. The Secretary was instructed to write a letter to Mr. Bell, 
expressing the sympathy of the Association. 
The President was asked to make a suitable reply to the 
telegram from the Text-Book Sub-Commission. 
’ After prayer by the retiring President, Mr. Billingsly, the 
Association was adjourned until its next regular meeting in 1910.

S. A. Link, who was born July 28, 1866, and died June 14, 
1906, was one of the prominent educators of the State and for 
a number of years an active member of this Association, For 
many years he conducted at Ashland City an excellent private 
school. From this location’ he was called to the position of Sup-
-P-A-G-E-769
    
erintendent of the School forthe’ Blind-at Nashville: After an 
efficient service to the State in that capacity he was elected a 
teacher of English in the Nashville -High School; a position for 
which his high scolarship and ‘literary ability eminently qualified 
him. During the latter years of his life'a large portion of his 
energy was devoted to the-study of Southern ‘Literature and 
the promotion of its study is’ the schools of our country. This 
was the crowning work of his life and the results of his efforts 
in this field are already visible in the increasing interest in the 
subject so dear to his heart. : 
About five years ago he established at Thomasville, Tennes- 
see, the Link School, which he successfully conducted until fail- 
ing health forced him to discontinue the work. 
He was a conscientious teacher, a sincere friend-to the many 
youths who came under the influence of his personality, and his 
whole life was an exemplification of a high type of Christian 
character. 
In his death this Association has lost a worthy: member, the 
“State a scholarly citizen, and the South a literary light of no 
small magnitude.

that you are here to get something good to take back to your 
work. , 
In 1849 there were thousands of men who went West to seek 
their fortune. Out of all the ones who went, there were only a 
few who got rich. Those who got rich were those who went 
for the particles of gold. If a man wants to get rich he must 
go for the nugget and not try to get rich all in a single leap, but 
carefully sift the sand and stones and save the precious yellow 
dust until he has gathered together enough to be worth a great 
sum, while others are running here and there looking for the 
nuggets. So if we who are here would get rich intellectually we 
should busy ourselves in trying to follow, not one’ man, but 
should sift out from each of the addresses we hear the things 
that are worthy and take back with us.

PROCEEDINGS STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION, 1910. 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON, JULY 2g, 1910. 
The Forty-fourth Annual Meeting of the Tennessee State 
Teachers’ Association was called to order by President S. Hous- 
ton Proffit at 3:00 o’clock, in Warren Hall, Monteagle. 
Prayer was offered by Superintendent G. R. McGee, of Jack- 
son City Schools. 
Dr. Hall, who was to deliver the Address of Welcome, was. 
not able to be present, and Dr. Lincoln Hulley, at the request of 
Dr. Hall, welcomed the teachers to Monteagle. He assured the 
teachers that Dr. Hall wished this to be the very warmest wel- 
come that it could be made, and because of the noble profession 
that was represented, he said the people of Monteagle were 
glad to welcome the teachers to their buildings and grounds. 
Prof. P. A. Lyon, of Murfreesboro, made the response to the 
Address of Welcome in.behalf of the teachers of the State. 
He expressed the appreciation of the teachers for the very cordial 
welcome extended and the interest expressed in the public school 
work of the State. 
At the close of this address Vice-President Gillentine took the 
chair and President S. Houston Proffit delivered the Annual 
Address. He outlined some of the features of the educational 
campaign that has been planned for the summer and autumn and 
suggested some lines along which we might work for the improve- 
ment of our school system. 
Before the Vice-President left the chair he appointed the 
following Committee on the President’s Address: C. E. Rogers, 
Chattanooga ; H. H. Clark, Somerville; and J. H. Sikes, Nash- 
ville. 
Dr. Brown Ayres, of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 
then addressed the Association on “The Relationship of the 
“University to the School System of the Sfate.” Dr. Ayres empha- 
sized the fact that each part of the public school system has
-P-A-G-E-772
— 746 —- 
its part to play, and urged that we spend a large portion of 
our energies on making a more efficient and cultured citizenship. 
Mr. Page then called attention to the fact that several mem- 
bers of the Executive Committee were not present, and as’ some 
-business should come before that committee at once, he urged 
that the places should be filled. The following were named to 
serve on the Executive Committee: G. C. Simmons, Fayetteville, 
instead of H. C. Weber; W. N. Billingsley, Spencer, for W. E. 
Stephens ; and J. H. Bayer, Huntingdon, for C. B. Ijams. 
It had been decided to leave to a vote of the Association to 
decide whether the Association would hold a meeting on Moriday 
or have night sessions and finish the work Saturday. Upon 
motion it was decided to finish the topics on the program by 
‘having night sessions and to have a session Monday morning to 
adjourn the Association. The Executive Committee was asked 
to retire and arrange the program for the evening session. 
Prof. A..J. Brandon, of Wartrace, read a very entertaining 
paper on “Home Economics in a County High School.” This 
address contained many helpful suggestions for the High School 
teachers. This paper appears in full elsewhere in the proceed- 
ings. , 
Secretary Harned read the following resolution, which was 
made a special order for 11:30 Saturday morning: 
Whereas, The time of meeting of the Tennessee Teachers 
‘seems to be a most inconvenient season, and, whereas, the coming 
together of school folk from all sections for the consideration 
of educational work in the State would tend to unify and improve 
our schools, then 
Resolved, That the Constitution be amended as follows: 
MEETING. 
The regular meetings shall be held annually on the last 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday of November, at such place 
as the Executive Committee shall designate. 
The Executive Committee then made their report on the 
program for the evening session, and the Association adjourned 
to meet at 8:00.0’clock if Warren Hall.

SATURDAY MORNING, JULY 30, 1910. 
- The meeting was called to order by the President at 9:15

Under the topic, “The Elementary Course of Study; What 
Essentials Should be Emphasized in Grammar,” was ably dis- 
cussed by Prof. R. K. Morgan, Fayetteville. 
Prof. J. D. Jacobs, Murfreesboro, then discussed “What 
Essentials Should Be Emphasized in Geography.” The other 
_ persons who were assigned topics under this head being absent, 
this subject was passed, and the subject of “School Improvement” 
Was taken up. 
“Miss Mildred English, Dickson, read a paper on “Effect of 
Refined Surroundings on the Pupil.” She was followed by Miss . 
Virginia P. Moore, Gallatin, State Organizer of School Improve- 
ment Work in Tennessee, who talked on “How School Premises / 
€a Be Beautified at Little or No Expense.” These papers were... 
discussed by Prof. Morgan, who-endorsed what the young ladie

“Tts Past, Present and Future” was discussed by Prof. G. R. 
McGee, the only living charter member of the Association. 
As a special order the address of the State Superintendent 
was heard next, his topic being “The Future of the Schools of 
Tennessee.” Prof. Jones spoke of the Elementary Schools, con- 
trasted actual conditions with desired conditions and made a 
plea for a campaign of education that will result in creating 
sentiment sufficiently strong to guarantee enough financial sup- 
port on the part of the public to build up a strong and efficient 
system of public education in Tennessee. 
At this point the Secretary, P. L. Harned, called for the special 
order set for this hour, which was the resolution proposing to 
change the time of this Association from vacation time, which is 
not to be later than the last day of July, to the last Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday in November, Thanksgiving Day and the 
Friday and Saturday following. 
After the resolution had been read, and the Constitution re-

J. Brandon, W. E. Stephens, W. E. Rogers, J. H. Bayer, P. L. 
Harned, P. A. Lyon and A. J. Wright. 
It was finally decided to amend the Constitution, fixing the

STATE OF - TENNesses, 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., June. 10, 1909. 
To Members of County Boards of Education: 
There was a strong effort on the part’ of some ‘members of 
the recent Legislature to repeal the county board law and return 
to the old district director system. Fortunately this effort failed 
and the law was not disturbed except in its application’ to a few 
counties. It is well for school officials and friends of education 
to note the source of opposition and the cause of. complaint 
against the operations of the law, so that if it lies in their -power 
to remove all cause of complaint and assure beyond any reason- 
able doubt the permanency of the county unit system of school 
organization and school administration they may have time and 
‘opportunity to do so. 
First, I noticed a considerable part of the opposition came 
from the old boards of district directors, and was chiefly personal, 
because their powers had been largely curtailed by the change in 
the law. This gave us no concern, for time will allay this’ oppo- 
sition, besides it has only a selfish basis for its existence and can- 
not long stand before the light of reason. 
The second objection was based on the ground that central- 
izing too much power in the hands of a few men is a dangerous 
policy, as large power to do good carries with it equally large . 
power, if abused, of doing-evil, and the charge was made that 
the administration of the schools was unwise and the power of 
the County Board of Education was not always used to promote 
the public good. As an evidence of this it was cited'that in some 
counties each board member looked after the school interest in 
his own district and was left free to employ teachers, repair and 
equip buildings, etc., at his own will’ This is not only:bad school 
policy, but is an open violation of the law. The board as‘a whole 
alone can make contracts, and individual members have no more
-P-A-G-E-782
— 756 — 
authority under the law, over the schools in the district which 
elected them, than they have over the remaining districts in the 
county. 
The board member ‘should take as much interest in every 
school in the county as he takes in the one of which he may be a 
“ patron. It is not only bad school policy, but dishonest in prin- 
ciple to undertake to build up a few schools in a county at the 
expense of all the rest. A conscientious board member will 
take as much interest in all the schools of the district as he takes 
in the immediate school of his:community, and a broad-gauged 
- member. will take an. equal interest in the development of alf the 
schools of his: county. : 
The evils that would follow, if each member be given: full 
sway in his district and relinquishes‘ his authority in all. others, 
are clearly apparent, “First, it would promote extravagance. . Mr, 
A wants a new-school house in his district, and left free to erect 
such a. structure ashe desires, he spends more money than the 
school fund will justify. .Mr. B wants as good or better school 
building for his district, and as a consequence spends a little 
more than Mr. A for his building, hence a rivalry is started 
among the various members to see who can get the most of the 
public fund for his respective district. Second, it destroys unity. 
The county system of education proposes to give as nearly as 
practicable equal opportunities to all the children of the county. 
This can only be done when the schools of the county as a whole 
are considered jointly. Third, it promotes nepotism. The mem- 
ber will have enough patronage to supply all his relatives and 
friends with schools, and can use the public funds for his per- 
sonal and political advantage and to the detriment of the children. 
. No member should. be permitted to have the absolute manage- 
ment of the schools of his district, and no honest, intelligent man 
‘will assume the responsibility for the management of schools and 
surrender his interest and control to some other party. Let the 
board act as a unit and transact no business except the board 
be in regular or called session. This is the only way. in which 
business can be legally and intelligently ‘transacted. Impeachment 
protveedings should be instituted against any school board: that par- 
cels out its schools among the different members. 
Ido not wish to be understood as intimating that the county
-P-A-G-E-783
— 757 — 
board law is not a success; far from it,. More has been accom- 
plished during the past two years for the advancement of the 
schools of the State than could have been accomplished in ten 
cryears under the old district director system, but I do wish to call 
your attention to some abuses that will greatly weaken, if not 
destroy, the efficiency of the law should they become generally 
practiced. 
EMpiovment or TEACHERS. 
Too much care cannot be exercised in the employment of 
teachers. Employ no one whose qualifications you have reason to - 
doubt. The children are entitled to the best teacher that can 
possibly be had. A school board that gives employment to any 
teacher, when a more competent one can be had, commits a crime 
against childhood and against the State. You will probably not 
be able in all cases to secure a teacher of the high type you 
would like to have, but in no case employ one who is not a person 
of excellent character and good standing in the community in 
which he is to teach. 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES. 
The salary of a teacher should be measured by his efficiency. 
In determining his efficiency several elements are to be taken into 
consideration. First, scholarship. It is an admitted fact that’ 
mo one can teach that which he does not know. A teacher’s 
knowledge should be far in advance of that which he is expected 
to impart.. Second, he should have tact or aptitude for the work. 
‘Some teachers with a limited equipment teach more successfully 
than others whose education is far:more complete. . This can be 
explained only on the ground that the one is either better adapted 
to the work, is a stronger executive or more industrious than the 
‘Other. Third, the teacher must have the power of leadership. 
“If the school performs its proper function it must be the center 
of the community life. It requires superior leadership to fix and 
“hold the eyes of the community upon the school. Fourth, the 
teacher must have influence in his community. This will guar- 
vantee the confidence and support of the community and. will 
Wiereby enable him to keep up a good attendance in the school. 
‘ifth, successful experience adds very much to the work of the 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-784
— 758 — 
teacher, and should be, a large factor in determining the salary 
paid. : 
‘ After having made efficiency the standard for determining the 
teacher’s salary, and after having paid due attention to scholar- 
ship, tact, executive ‘ability, power of leadership, influence in the 
community, experience, etc., you will still have many delicate 
problems with which to deal in determining salaries in individual 
cases. To illustrate: two young men about the same age and 
with the same native ability may apply for a position; one has 
little more than a grammar school education and the other has 
‘taken a high school course; while neither has demonstrated his 
ability as a teacher, yet the one with broader training has a larger 
investment, larger possibilities, hence he should be paid a larger 
salary to begin with. © 
All successful business concerns employ people in such way 
as to stimulate effort on the part of their employes. This same 
business principle should prevail in the employment of teachers. 
Considering character, scholarship, training and native ability, 
start the young teacher at a minimum salary with the under- 
standing that if he makes good his salary will be increased at the 
beginning of the second term, and thus from year to year in- 
crease his salary until he reaches the maximum that your county 
is able to pay. This will offer greater inducement to the young 
man or woman to remain in the profession. Unquestionably the 
tendency in the past has been to offer too much inducement to 
the inexperienced and untrained young man or woman to enter 
the teaching ranks and not enough inducement to remain in the 
work after having taken it up. It would not infrequently happen 
that a young man or woman would be paid the same salary for 
their first year’s work that was being paid teachers of ten years’ 
experience. This had a tendency to discourage the experienced 
teacher and to make the young, inexperienced self-satified, thus 
the growth of both was retarded. 
Do not be too dogmatic or narrow in the gradation of teachers’ 
salaries. I know one board that’ bases the teacher’s salary en- 
tirely on the average daily attendance. This is an important 
element. Unmistakably a teacher who can have a daily attend- 
ance of 60 per cent is really worth more than twice as much as 
one who maintains a daily attendance, under the same condi-
-P-A-G-E-785
— 759 — 
tions, of 30 per cent.. But it must be borne in mind that it 
requires more skill and labor to keep up a daily attendance of 
30 per cent in some communities than-is required to secute a 
daily attendance of 60 per cent in another, so great.is the dif- 
ference in the communities themselves. I-know ‘another school 
board that bases the salary entirely on scholastic attainments, 
as shown bythe certificate presented. Certainly scholarship is 
absolutely necessary and the certificate should furnish some 
knowledge of the scholarship of the holder, yet it frequently 
thappens that the one who holds the highest mark is not the 
most efficient teacher. Take all the elements mentioned above, 
and more, in estimating your teachers’ salaries, arid consult freely 
with your County Superintendent, who: should make a study of 
both the teacher and the school. 
INSTITUTES. . 
All teachers should be encouraged to attend institutes and 
summer. schools, and boards should recognize, first, those who 
are putting forth greatest effort for individual improvement. 
ScHoot LirBaRIEs. 
The last Legislature passed an act providing State aid for 
public school libraries on the following conditions: 
. “Whenever the patrons and friends of any public school in 
any county of the State shall raise by private subscription or 
otherwise and tender to the County Trustee, through the County 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, the sum of twenty dollars 
($20) or more for the establishment and maintenance of a library 
for that school, said County Superintendent shall notify the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and, upon the certificate of 
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Comptroller 
@£-the Treasury shall pay to the Trustee of said county, out of 
s fund herein provided, a sum equal to half that raised by 
vate subscription or otherwise, to be added to the library fund 
psaid school; and whenever ten dollars ($10) or more shall be 
ed by private subscription or otherwise to stipplement a 
ty already established under the provisions of this section        
    
  
-P-A-G-E-786
— 760 — 
of this Act, said library may in like manner receive from the 
fund herein provided a'sum equal to half the sum so raised. 
“Provided, that no school shall receive in any one year from 
this fund more than twenty dollars ($20) for the establishment 
of a new library, or more than ten dollars ($10) to assist in sup- 
plementing a library already established. 
“Provided, further, that in distributing the funds under the 
provisions of this section of this Act preference shall be given to 
applications coming from counties which have not previously re- 
ceived their proportionate part of this fund according to scholastic 
population, 
“And, provided, further, that preference shall be given to 
applications for assistance to establish new libraries rather than 
applicants to assist in supplementing libraries already estab- 
lished. 
“It shall be the duty of the State Board of Education to 
make and cause to be published through the office of the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction rules and regulations for 
libraries established under the provisions of this section of this 
Act, issue approved lists of books from which purchases for 
said libraries may be made with money received from the State 
as herein provided, and arrange for the purchase of such books 
at the lowest possible prices. All libraries receiving assistance 
from this fund shall comply with all the regulations made by the 
State Board of Education, as herein provided. All money re- 
céived from the State to assist in establishing or supplementing 
a library under the provisions of this section shall be used to 
purchase books on the approved lists aforesaid, and no books shall 
be purchased at a higher price than the price in said approved 
lists. All purchases of books shall be reported to the County 
Superintendent, and a list of the same shall be attached to the 
warrant issued in payment of the same; and no commission shall 
be allowed the County Trustee on library funds.” 
There will be for distribution during the scholastic year 
1909-10 between $9,000 and $10,000 of the Library Fund. It is 
desired that the school of each county comply with the above con- 
ditions so that each may receive its proportionate part of the 
library fund. I do not believe the Board of Education would 
be justified in spending the school fund in the purchase of books,
-P-A-G-E-787
= 761 
but if the community will-secure the books I think it would be a 
owise investment for the Board of Education to purchase a case 
in which to put them, : 
Pledging you my most hearty co-operation in all your efforts 
to improve the public schools, I remain, 
‘Sincerely yours, 
R. L, Jones, 
State Superintendent, 
NASHVILLE, TENN., June 14, 1909. 
Dear Sir: The last Legislature passed a measure, known 
as the “General Education Bill,’ whereby 25 per cent of the 
gross revenues of the State are set aside as a General Education 
Fund. Ten per cent of the General Education Fund is set aside 
as a special fund to be used in more nearly equalizing the school 
terms of the various counties of the State. 
This special fund will amount to about ninety thousand 
($90,000) Dollars for the present scholastic year. 
Before, however, a county is permitted to share in the distri- 
bution of this fund, “it shall levy for public schools, including 
the school taxes levied by the State and excluding taxes for 
‘public high schools, a tax of not less than forty. cents on each 
One Hundred Dollars of taxable property, a tax of Two Dollars 
on each taxable poll, and all the privilege taxes which the laws 
of the State permit counties to levy for school purposes.” Seven- 
ty-three counties last year met the above requirements and re- 
ceived a portion of the Fifty Thousand Dollars which had pre- 
viously been set aside by legislative enactment for the purpose 
of more nearly equalizing the school terms of the State. This 
special fund prolonged the school terms in some counties almost 
amonth. Through the failure of your County Court last year to 
levy the required local tax mentioned above, your county did not 
receive a dollar of this fund. With the amount increased from 
Fifty Thousand to Ninety Thousand Dollars, you will lose a still 
larger amount the present year. I write to urge upon you the 
importance of your court’s meeting the legal requirements so 
that: you may receive the legitimate part of the State fund that is 
  
-P-A-G-E-788
— 762 — 
justly due the children of your county. If you do not make the 
levy, you merely cpntribute your proportionate part of the special 
fund to the other, .-unties meeting the legal requirements. © 
The amount the average county will receive from this fund 
will exceed One Thousand Dollars. Can you afford to lose this 
- to your children? T hope your court can see its way clear to 
place your county upon the eligible list, and that at the July term 
of the Quarterly Court you will make the necessary local tax 
levy so that your county may share in the January distribution 
of this fund. If you do not levy the tax at the July term, you will 
lose your share of the fund for the scholastic year, 1909-1910. 
Pledging you my earnest co-operation for the betterment of 
the public schools, I beg to remain, 
Sincerely yours, 
R. L. Jones, 
State Superintendent, 
NAsHviLtE, TENN., June 24, 1909. 
Dear Sir: I have mailed you package of circular matter, 
together with twenty official envelopes. I want you to mail in 
the enclosed envelopes a circular letter to the members of your 
County Court., Please do this at once, as court convenes the first 
Monday in July. . 
I trust that your county, if it has not already done so, will 
vote a high school tax, and, if it has not already levied as much 
as a 40-cent tax on the One Hundred Dollars, a $2.00 poll and 
all the privilege tax that the law will permit that you may prevail 
upon them to do so at the July term of court. 
The funds arising from the General Education Fund for the 
July distribution will amount to $650,0c0o—$65,000 of which will 
be applied for the purpose of equalizing the school terms of the 
State, $52,000 of which will go to the maintenance of county high 
schools of the State. Your county should share in both these 
funds. If I can assist you in any way, feel free to command me.

NASHVILLE, TENN., September 20, .1909.. 
My Dear Sir: It was the original purpose of the State Board 
of Education to visit-all the proposed Normal School sites and 
decide upon a location before the October term of the quarterly ~ 
County Court, so that the county securing the Normal could issue 
its bonds and thereby not delay the building. However, other 
pressing duties have rendered it impossible for the Board to visit 
and inspect all the proposed sites before the first Monday in 
October, hence I am writing you to see to it that your County 
Court, at its October term, issues the bonds in accordance with 
the provisions of Chapter 580, Acts of 1909. The county secur- 
ing the Normal can then place its bonds on the market within 
thirty days after the Normal School is located, and those coun- 
_ ties failing to secure the Normal will not-be placed to any cost 
or inconvenience by taking this action, as the bonds need not 
“be printed. 
* Some counties at the July term of court took the necessary 
legal steps in the issuance of the bonds, and this letter does not 
apply to them, but the greater number of counties merely passed 
resolutions committing the court to a bond issue in the event the 
State Board of Education should locate the Normal within their 
county. 
Iam making this request so that the erection of the Normal 
School buildings will not be delayed until,the meeting of the 
January Quarterly Court before the bonds cai be issued and 
placed upon the market. Sincerely yours,

To County and City Superintendents: 
Chapter 172, of the Acts of 1877, makes it “the duty of the 
County Superintendents of Public Schools of each county to set 
apart some day in November of each year as Arbor Day in all 
-the public schools of the county, that trees may be planted around 
the buildings, that the grounds around such buildings may be 
improved and beautified; such planting to be attended with 
appropriate and attractive ceremony, that the day may be one of 
pleasure as well as of instruction to the young, all to be under 
the supervision and direction of the teacher, who shall see that 
the trees are properly selected and set.” 
In order to secure uniformity in the observance of the day 
throughout the State, I recommend that Friday, November 19, 
be observed as Arbor Day in all of the schools of Tennessee. 
Desirous of co-operating with the State and local Boards of 
Health and all other forces engaged in the work of enlightening 
the public in regard to the spread of tuberculosis and other com- 
municable and contagious diseases that are so often developed 
and spread in the school-room, I recommend that Friday, Novem- 
‘ber 19, also be observed as Public Health Day, that the pupils 
‘may. be-informed and impressed as to the cause, prevention and
-P-A-G-E-799

cure of the dread disease  coltetniption and taught the value of

Day and for Arbor Day:~ ‘This department is indebted to Miss 
‘Virginia P. Moore, State’ Orgattizer, School Improvement Asso- 
ciations, for the suggestive program for Arbor Day. -Conditions

Arbor Day for the cleaning and beautifying of.school houses.and 
grounds. Let us do away with the school houses that look like 
side-tracked box cars by making them more attractive. Teachers, ° 
plan the work and appoint your committees for doing the work. 
Let us make this a red-letter day for the beautifying of the child’s 
surroundings. If your school grounds are already as beautiful as 
possible, give your time to the inside of the house.

When possible get trees, shrubs, and bulbs from the nursery. 
Select trees suitable for your locality. Cut off the bruised roots 
of the tree. Be sure the hole is large enough so that roots will 
not touch the sides of the hole. If the ground is fresh ao water 
need be used in the planting. The surface: soil should be care- 
fully worked: among ‘the finer roots, then covered entirély with 
the lower soil. Then make firm as possible by tramping. In 
selecting trees consider size.and symmetry of trees. If the soil 
is poor, place rich soil or fertilizer in the hole. Protect trees 
by a wire casing or boxing. Group the trees rather than plant 
in rows in the usual nursery style. The Department of Agri- 
culture, Washington, D. C., will send literature for Arbor Day 
and tree planting, upon. application. Plant vines and shrubs for 
screening. Wild grape vines, honeysuckle and other vines found 
in the woods are well suited for planting on the school grounds. 
Watxs ComMMITTEE. 
Dig out the earth at least two or three inches for the walks 
before placing gravel or crushed stone. When possible use 
concrete for walks. Let several grades select a special bulb and 
each child plant a bulb along the. walks. , 
Fence aNp- Repair CoMMITTEE. 
Build a new fence or repair the old one, repair all buildings 
in need of it, under-pin the house. School furniture and appa- 
-ratus may also be repaired. 
Water CoMMITTEE, 
Clean well. If the well is open, put in a pump. Get water 
coolers and individual drinking cups, or at least a sufficient 
supply of dippers and provide nails to hang them on. Have 
drinking fountains where it is possible. : 
The women and girls can keep busy on the inside of the 
school building.

Is-in windows for admission of fresh air. When possible 
de for adequate means for heating and ventilating. For 
--; usa Schools I suggest the Waterbury, Smith, or Grossius heat- 
    ng and ventilating systems. 
See to condition of toilets ; where there is none, build one. 
Decoration COMMITTEE. 
Paper, paint or tint the walls, latter two preferred. Never 
have a red or dark grey room. Greens or tans preferred. Choose 
a simple color scheme for the rooms, something that will har- 
monize‘with the color of furniture and woodwork. When pos- 
sible paint floors, have them darkest tone, the side walls a medium 
tone, the lightest tone on the ceiling and drop border. Muresco 
or calsimo can be put on over wall paper if the paper is hung 
tightly. Hang fresh sash curtains on wire or curtain poles. Fill 
window boxes with plants. Select a few good prints (large size). 
Heavy mats are neat, but frames are preferred. 
It is hoped that every child in the State will plant at least 
one thing. If you have no ground for planting, fill the window 
boxes and plant bulbs. It may be that you cannot accomplish all 
that is suggested above at once, but do the things that are most 
needed at your school on Arbor Day.

to be taught, a good high school will afford the means of enrich- 
: dng: the home: life and will exert-a wholesome influence ‘on the 
industrial development of the country:

of rural schools may have an opportunity for better preparing 
themselves for their work. / 
5. Experience has demonstrated that it exerts a wholesome 
influence on the attendance in the elementary schools. 
_ Every State in the Union that has anything like perfected 
a system of education has developed along with its elementary 
schools a good system of high schools: Forty counties in Ten- 
nessee have established sixty-seven high schools, and it is con- 
fidently believed that before the scholastic year ending June 30, 
1910, shall have closed, more than three-fourths of the counties 
of the State will have established one or more high schools. ” 
"Let me urge that you, as a member of the County Court, give 
the high school problem earnest consideration, for upon your 
action the educational advancement of your county depends. 
Virginia, Alabama and Louisiana—in fact, practically all our 
Southern States within the past few years have established sys- 
tems of good county high schools. Let us see to it that Tennessee 
keeps pace with her sister States in all educational advancement.

INFORMATION FOR ‘ARCHITECTS RELATIVE TO 
« .NORMAL SCHOOL BUILDINGS FOR TENNESSEE. 
The State Board of Education in regular session voted to 
adopt plans and specifications for Norma] School buildings by 
open competition, and instructed the Secretary to furnish the 
same data to all architects desiring to compete. 
The Board does not offer any premium for plans submitted 
unless the same should be accepted. The successful competitor 
will receive the usual architect’s fee, or sich amount as the Board 
and the architect may agree upon.. The plan of each architect 
must be accompanied with approximate cost of construction, and 
any contract made with the architect will be conditioned on the 
actual cost of the.building, as shown by the successful bid of the 
contractor, not exceeding the architect’s estimate more than 10 
per cent. : 
Give both the cost of fireproof and ordinary construction. 
Consider nothing but good material in estimating the cost. Stone 
or concrete will most likely be used for foundation. Brick will 
be used as material for buildings.

Main school building .................. $130,000 
Woman’s Dormitory ...............40- 50,000 
The main building should contain a.chapel with seating ca-

rooms for the manual arts; laboratories, with a-lecture room

  < of ‘observation. and ‘practice school; a library room; twelve. to 
sixteen class rooms; two or three rooms to be used for offices 
until administration building can be, obtained. 
It is the purpose of the Board to erect a separate science 
building as soon as funds can be obtained. For that reason it 
might be well to provide for the manual arts, domestic science, 
laboratories, etc., in the basement, as they would be transferred 
to the science building when erected. Arrange study hall, if 
possible, so that in the future it may be divided up into lecture 
rooms if desired. 
Woman’s dormitory should be fireproof construction and ‘so 
arranged as to accommodate as large a number of occupants:

“NASHVILLE. TENN., March 23, 1910. 
Dear Sir: I am writing to the magistrates of the State 
especially calling their attention to the necessity of providing 
adequate funds for running the public schools for a term of at 
least seven or eight months. 
I am enclosing you a copy of the Elementary Course of 
Study prepared for the public schools of the State. From this 
you will see that a child entering school at the age of six can 
complete the primary public school course at the age of fourteen 
and be able to enter the County High School. A year’s work 
cannot be successfully done with a school term much shorter 
than eight months. If the term is only five or six months, it will 
take two years for the child to do one year’s work as laid out 
in the Course of Study. This means that instead of a child 
’ completing the primary public school course at the age of four- 
teen the time is extended to the age of twenty-two, As you well 
know, the average child does not remain in school much beyond 
the age of fifteen or sixteen years, hence with our short term a 
_very small per cent of our scholastic population finish the primary 
public school course. Do, you not think. it would be the part 
of wisdom, as well-as economy, to give a full year’s work instead
-P-A-G-E-809
— 783 — 
©f taking two years of the child’s life to give it one year’s 
amental growth? It will take a child two: years of five months 
each to.do as much work as.it can do in. one year of-eight months. 
Suppose that you, pay the teacher $50 per month, in two years 
of five months each it will cost you. $500 to have the. children 
of a given community taught through one grade,. :}f you have 
an eight months’ term and pay the teacher $50 per month; you 
will have paid $400 for teaching the children through one 
gerade, thus there is a saving-of $100.and one.year of the child’s 
life by giving it a full scholastic term instead of giving it two. 
pieces. 
All the city systems of schools in Tennessee have a nine 
xmonths’ term in which the. child is to complete its, year’s. work 
‘This is none too much. I believe.the people of the country are 
just as able to educate their children and their childrens’ needs 
are just as great as those who live in the cities.

Tennessee. The East Tennessee teachers will be given an oppor- 
tunity of taking the Course in Agriculture at the Summer School 
of the South, and it is hoped that a good delegation from each 
‘county will take this course. However, the subject of Biology 
will be taught by specialists in the State Institutes of East Ten- 
nessee instead of the subject of Agriculture. Teachers from West 
‘and Middle Tennesese State Institutes who desire to take the 
Course in Agriculture at the Summer School of the South will 
excused from the State Institute at the close of the third week 
in order to reach Knoxville in time to take the entire course. 
Liprary Course For TEACHERS. 
Much of the instructional work of the modern school is done 
through the medium of the library. ‘Its books and periodicals 
-are essential in the preparation of many lessons in the various 
branches, as well as for required supplemental reading and for 
-general reading. In recognition of this fact there is an increas- 
-ing demand that public school teachers should have as a part 
of their equipment a working knowledge of library methods suf- 
ficient to enable them to organize and administer school libraries 
with success. This department feels that it is peculiarly fortunate 
“in securing the services of Mrs. Pearl Williams Kelley, who has 
had good library training, to conduct instruction in this work 
.fér one week in each of the three State Institutes in Middle 
Tennessee. ‘

Primary AND SECONDARY COURSES. 
gular courses in the Primary and Secondary Courses 
-win ue given, “The Primary Course embraces all the subjects 
required to be taught in the primary public school, and, in addi- 
- tion, the Reading Circle Course as outlined by the Reading 
Circle Committee. 
The Secondary Course, which - requires for admission the 
completion of the Primary and passing a satisfactory examina- 
tion. in- same, embraces all the subjects required to be taught in 
the secondary school, together with the Reading Circle Course 
as outlined by the Reading Circle Committee. The Reading 
Circle Course for primary teachers embraces Niver’s School 
History of England and Tompkin’s School Management; for 
secondary teachers, Parkman’s LaSalle and the Discovery of the 
Great West, and Salisbury’s Theory of Teaching. 
TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES, 
All teachers who are in attendance at least fifteen days and 
who pass a satisfactory examination in the Primary Course will 
be given a’ Third Grade Certificate, signed by the State Super- 
intendent, the Conductor, and the Secretary of the Faculty. This 
certificate will exempt the holder from any county examination 
for one year. All teachers who are in attendance at least fifteen 
days and who pass a satisfactory examination in the Secondary 
Course will be given a Roll of Honor Certificate, which will 
- exempt the holder from any county examination for a period of 
four years. 
TERMS OF RENEWAL. 
Any teacher who holds a State Primary Certificate may have 
:the same renewed by attending a State Institute fifteen days 
“a preceding the examination held at the close of the Institute, pro- 
vided the holder did not fall below 75 in any subject or subjects,
-P-A-G-E-813
— 737 — 
in which case the applicant would be requited to take an exami- 
nation on all subjects on which'a lower grade than 75 was made, 
and provided, further, that the holder of the State Certificate 
pass a satisfactory examination upon ‘the subjects embraced in 
the State Reading Circle Course. . 
If an applicant desires two years in which to take the Second- 
ary Course, he should have his Primary Certificate renewed on 
completing and taking a satisfactory examination < on four second- 
ary subjects. 
Credit will be given the following years for secondary sub- 
jects passed, and the holder may finish.the remaining secondary 
subjects and receive a Roll of Honor Certificate. Roll-of Honor 
Certificates will be renewed on the sathé conditions as those 
specified above for the renewal of Primary Certificates. 
A uniform examination ‘willbe given by the State Superin- 
tendent at the close of the Institute,

     Lo Members of County Courts: 
Chapter 279, Acts of 1899, provides “that whenever it shall 
pear to the County Court of any county that the public interest 
wires it, the said court shall have power to provide for the 
‘{Sstablishment and maintenance of one or more high schools for 
instruction of the children of-the county, to be. managed as 
inafter provided.” The law provides that “the County Court 
yy levy a special tax for high schools not to exceed 15cents on 
One Hundred Dollars of all taxable property, to be, levied 
collected as other county taxes, and the said court: shall also 
power to make appropriations out of any county funds not 
wise appropriated, except out of the public school funds: 
‘funds thus provided shall be kept separate: and ‘apart frori 
ther funds and applied exclusively to the estabfishment and 
tenance of a high school or schools.  
-P-A-G-E-814
— 788 — 
The law vests the management of the County High School in-a 
County High School Board, composed of seven members, “six 
of whom are elected by the County Court, the County Superin- 
tendent being ex-officio a member of the County High School 
Board and Secretary thereof.” Under the provisions of this 
Act twenty-five counties in the State have levied taxes and ‘have 
put into successful operation a system of high schools, but, owing 
to the small tax valuation of property in some counties, together 
with other pressing obligations resting upon the county, it, has 
been difficult to secure the high school tax levy. However, the 
‘fast Legislature passed: an Act whereby the State proposes to 
assist in maintaining a high school in each and every county:in 
the State. Under the stimulus of the probable passage of -the 
Act, whereby the State would aid in the maintenance of county 
high schoois, thirteen additional counties at the April term of 
the. County Court levied a tax for the support of high schools, 
thus making the number of counties that now have the beginning 
of a high school system thirty-eight. Since the passage of the 
Act, by. which every county in the State is guaranteed help, 
. provided it will help itself, it is earnestly believed by the friends 
of education that within a year practically every county in the 
State will have put into successful operation a system of county 
high. schools. 
The State sets aside for high schools, cight per cent of the 
. General Education Fund, as provided by Section 5, Chapter 264 
of: the Acts ‘of 1909, which will provide a fund of about Seventy- 
five Thousand Dollars. The Act reads as follows: 
“That eight per cent of the General Education Fund provided 
by this Act shall be used as a high school fund, to encourage and 
assist the counties of the State to establish and maintain public’ 
county high schools as hereinafter provided. 
“Tt shall be the duty of the State Board of Education to grade 
all: -high’ schools ‘now. established and maintained, or that in the 
future may be-established and maintained under the provisions 
of the ‘county: highschool law; to prescribe their minimum 
courses: of study, requiring the elements of agriculture and home 
econéinics| tobe taught in all schools, and to classify them as 
igh schools of the first, second and third class.     
   
-P-A-G-E-815
“789 — 
“Under such regulations as may be’prescribed by the State 
Board of Education, all qualified public county high schools may 
receive assistance from the fund provided by this Act, and this 
section of this Act, in proportion to the amount of money re- 
ceived by the several schools from other sources and expended 
annually for the payment of teachers’ salaries and incidentals, 
not including permanent improvements of grounds or buildings ; 
provided, that no county may receive in any one year more than 
one-fiftieth part of the total fund provided by this section of this 
Act for that year, and that no one school shall receive from this 
fund more than one-third the amount received from other sources 
and expended in that year for its maintenance, not including 
any amount expended. for permanent improvements. 
“All applications for assistance under the provisions of this 
section of this Act shall be made in such a way as may be pre- 
scribed by the State Board of Education, and all payment. shall 
be made on the certificate of the President and Secretary of 
said Board. 
“All teachers in the public county high schools receiving aid 
from this high school fund under the provisions of this section of 
this Act shall be examined and licensed under regulations pre- 
scribed by the State Board of Education, and said Board is 
hereby empowered and instructed to make rules and regula- 
‘tions for the examination and licensing of such teachers. The 
State Board of Education shall have the power, and the same is 
hereby authorized, to employ an Inspector of High Schools at 
such annual salary as it may determine, his salary and traveling 
expenses when engagéd in the work of high school inspection 
or the performance of other related duties assigned him by the 
State Board of Education to be paid out of the high school fund 
herein provided. Said High School Inspector shall have his 
office in the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, and shall give his time to the inspection of high schools in 
the State and such other related duties as may be assigned him 
by the State Board of Education, and shall make reports of his 
work and of the conditions of the high schools of the State as 
required and directed by said Board. 
“Any portion of the high school fund of any year provided 
by this Act and this section of this Act that cannot be appor-
-P-A-G-E-816

ioned to the public high schools of the State without exceeding 
she ratio to income of. such schools as provided in this section 
of thisAct shall revert to the school fund provided in Section 2.” 
sof this Act and be apportioned as therein provided. 
“Sec. 6. Be it further enacted, That one per cent of the Gen- 
‘eral Education Fund provided’ by this Act shall be used to en- 
  courage and assist in the establishment and maintenance of: 
libraries in the public schools as herein provided.” 
. Under the provisions of this Act the schools will be stand- 
ardized and classified by the State Board of Education, and the 
high school teachers will undergo an examination under rules 
and regulations prescribed’ by the State Board. This will guar- 
antee qualified teachers for your county high schools. As you 
see from the provisions of the Act, no county can share in the 
State appropriation unless it levies a local tax for high school 
purposes. If your county does not levy a high school tax the 
proportionate part of the general school fund that justly belongs 
to you will go to the maintenance of high schools in other coun~ 
ties. I do not believe there is a county in the State that is able 
to lose its share of this fund. The average county would receive 
am amount just a little less than one thousand dollars. 
Levy Your Tax aT THE Jury TERM oF Court. 
If you will levy your tax at the July term of court, your 
county will share in the January distribution of the State funds 
and will receive the local tax for 1909. If you fail to levy at the 
July term, you have postponed the establishment of a high school 
for-one year. I ask you to consider this matter carefully, as it 
involves the rights of your children in providing adequate means 
for their receiving a practical education, and at the same time 
it involves the right of your county to receive its proportionate 
part of the fund set aside by the State for each and every 
county, if it will only accept it. 
: Sincerely yours, 
R. L. Jongs, 
State Superintendent.

NAsuHVILLE, TENN., August 10, IgI0. 
Dear Sir: I have mailed you under separate cover a proc- 
lamation suspending the schools of your county on the day the 
educational mass-meeting is held. All teachers in attendance will 
be given their regular pay. Teachers should, if possible, bring 
their students in a body. Please publish proclamation in your 
county papers, and give all your teachers notice.. Arrange for 
an outdoor meeting if you think the size of the crowd will de- , 
. mand it. Appoint a committee on arrangement, and such other 
committees as may be of advantage to you in making the day a 
success. Call a meeting of your County Board of Education and 
enlist their active support. 
Circular matter will be sent you from this office for distribu- 
tion, and your Board of Education may send out such additional 
advertising as they think necessary. If your Board members will 
visit the schools of their respective districts the week before the 
rally and talk up the meeting, it will guarantee a magnificent 
crowd, and we are anxious to reach as many people as possible. 
Get a few good local speakers to deliver addresses of fifteen 
or twenty minutes in length. Enlist the interest of all your min- 
isters and reach as nearly as possible your whole people. These 
gentlemen, who ate making this campaign without profit to them- 
selves, or cost to the county, should have the active support of all 
good citizens in promoting the cause they represent. 
This movement embraces in its scope the entire State. The 
good it does your county will depend on the interest taken by your 
county itself. See that this is the largest and best educational 
meeting ever held in your county. 
Yours for the improvement of our schools, 
. R. L, Jones, 
P. S.—If the mass meeting for your county comes on Satur- 
' day, you may suspend schools on Friday, if necessary to meet 
the convenience of the teachers.

Dear Sir: I am sending. you under separate cover thirty 
postcards for you to mail out to leading citizens of your county 
inviting their presence at and support of your educational mass 
meeting. I would suggest that you mail out-the cards ten days 
or two weeks before the meeting is held if time will permit. If 
there is anything further this department can do to promote the 
‘success of your meeting feel free to command us. - 
I. 
Please mail to this office the names and addresses of the newly 
elected board members of your county. Also send the names and 
addresses of the High School Board members if your county has 
established high schools. 
TIT. 
There is now in the hands of the State Treasurer $9,000 school 
library funds. Some counties last year established as high as 
twenty-four libraries and secured from the State several hundred 
dollars of this fund while others secured nothing. Every county 
is entitled to share in the library fund and any teacher who will 
take up the library question in her school ought to have no trouble 
in securing enough local funds supplemented by what the State 
will aid to start a nucleus for a library. 
Yours truly, 
R. L. Jones, 
State Superintendent.

My Dear Sir: I have visited many high schools of the State, 
and upon my own observation and study of the system, am clearly 
of the opinion that none except the wealthiest counties should at- 
tempt to run more than one high school, but that enough money 
should be furnished that one to employ the best teachers and 
make the school first class in all of its departments. The State
-P-A-G-E-823
— 797 — 
does not attempt to run more than one university, but that is-of 
such efficiency, that. every hour of-the student’s time counts for 
something. Neither can a county serve the people best with a 
so-called high school on every hill top. 
One good, strong high school may not have so many pupils 
as could go to several schools located at different places, but the 
work in this first class high school is worth while and the only 
school period in the life of the children is not wasted. The first 
class high school inspires the pupil to action, the inefficient high © 
schoo] cannot lift the pupil to a higher plane. 
If your county will levy the high school tax again, concentrate 
its forces so as to do good service, you may depend-upon the 
State to supplement this fund to the amount of fifteen hundred 
dollars. Your board can then run valuable courses in agricul- 
ture, home economics and business in addition to the regular 
academic course. Your school would then be good enough for the 
rich or poor and serve all-interests of the county.’ It could be as 
good as any school anywhere. 
Trusting that Campbell County will levy the high school tax 
and become one of the leaders in high school work, I beg to re- 
main, Most respectfully, 
P. L. Harnep, 
: . . Inspector, 
P. S.—I have read this letter and fully concur in all the state- 
ments made. - RL, Jonzs, 
State Superintendent.

Dear Sir: As you have previously learned, no doubt, there 
will be a great educational mass meeting held in your county on 
September ...... , 1910. We write to urge your most earnest 
support in making this the greatest day educationally in the his- 
tory of your county. Your schools have been suspended for the 
above day that all teachers and pupils may attend. Teachers who 
attend are given their full pay for the day. Invite magistrates, 
patrons and all friends of education to attend this meeting to the 
end that your county may receive the greatest possible benefit 
from the State campaign for education, 
I would suggest that you put in a few days prior to the meet- 
ing visiting your scliools and working up the school mass meeting 
in your county. You will want to visit your schools anyway early 
in the session and you can work up your educational meeting at 
the same time. ‘Sincerely yours,

All persons applying for a County Certificate shall undergo 
an examination, except graduates of the Peabody College and 
persons holding State Certificates. A Primary State Certificate 
expires in one year and an Honor Roll Certificate expires within 
four yéars from date of issuance. State certificates. may be re- 
mewed at State Institutes, under such rules and regulations as 
-the State Superisitendent may prescribe. All applicants making 
‘ ‘an average of 85 per cent and not falling below 60 per cent on 
‘any one subject required to be taught in the primary public 
schodls shall receive a Third Grade, or Primary Certificate. The 
‘following branches are required to be taught in the primary 
wublic schools: Spelling, Reading, Writing, Mental Arithmetic, 
ritten Arithmetic, English Grammar, Geography, History of 
mnessee, History of the United States, Physiology and Hygiene 
Theory and Practice. In addition to the above named sub- 
, the applicant for a Third Grade Certificate must undergo an 
ination on all the primary subjects required in the State Read- 
Circle Course for Teachers, which for the present year embraces 
1’s School History of England, and Tompkins’ School Manage- 
The percentages made on these subjects count in making the 
ig mark just the same as other subjects. All applicants - 
ig an average of not less than 85 per cent and not falling 
60 per cent on any one subject in all the branches re-

quired to be taught in the public school course are entitled to 
receive a First Grade, or Secondary Certificate. The subjects 
- additional to'the above, or the secondary subjects, are Elementary 
Geology ‘of Tennessee, Elementary Principles of Agriculture, 
: Elements of Algebra, Elements of Plane Geometry, Elements 
of Natural Philosophy, Elementary Bookkeeping, Elements of 
Civil Government, Theory and Practice, and School Law. The 
‘State Reading Circle subjects the present year for secondary 
teachers embrace Parkman’s La Salle and The Discovery of the 
Great West, and Saulsbury’s Theory and Practice. All appli- 
cants for a secondary certificate must pass an examination on 
the State Reading Circle subjects. All applicants making an 
average of not less than 75 per cent on all subjects embraced in 
the public school, and not falling below 60 per cent on any one 
subject, are entitled to receive a Second Grade Certificate. A 
knowledge of the secondary course would presuppose a knowl- 
edge of the primary subjects, hence a First or Second Grade 
Certificate may be issued on examination in secondary subjects only. 
EXAMINATIONS. 
All examinations should be reasonable and fair, and the 
‘grading of papers should be accurate and just. Nothing is more 
demoralizing than an unreasonably rigid examination followed 
by lax, loose, indifferent examination and gradation of papers. 
All certificates should be dated from July Ist, as any certifi- 
cate dated prior to that time would expire on June 30th after the 
date of its issuance. : : 
Section 27 provides that “‘no teacher of public schools shall be 
employed or receive any pay from the public funds unless he or 
she have a certificate of qualification given to him or her by the 
County Superintendent for the county within which he or she is 
employed. No such payment shall be allowed, if made, and any 
officer who shall make or sanction it shall also be subject to a 
penalty of not less than Five nor more than Fifty Dollars.” 
The County Superintendent and the County Boards of Educa- 
tion should notify all teachers of the necessity of attending the 
first regular examination so that they may be on the eligible list 
when the Board of Education meets in July to select its teachers. 
You are requested to hold public examinations on the fol- 
| owing dates and to give no private examinations:
-P-A-G-E-827
— 801 — 
The first, the annual examination, to be held at the close of 
the County Institute. 
The second examination to be held the first Friday and Sat- 
urday in August. 
The third examination to be held the first Friday and Sat- 
urday in October. 
The fourth examination to be held the first Friday and Sat- 
urday in January. 
Require all teachers, “except those exempt as hereinbefore 
mentioned, to take the examination. 
‘The strongest teachers are always ready and willing to take 
an examination for the moral effect it may have on the weaker 
who seek to avoid examinations in every way possible. The 
County Superintendent is the sole judge of the qualifications of 
the teacher who applies for a license to teach in his county. 
If the incompetent are licensed the responsibility lies with him. 
No one should receive a license who is not worthy and well quali- 
fied for the position ‘sought. It is questionable whether it is 
not better for a school to remain untaught than to have same 
taught by an incompetent teacher. 
DUPLICATING CERTIFICATES. 
It is not a wise policy to duplicate certificates issued by Su- 
perintendents of other counties. As a rule, the teacher who 
~ . wants a certificate duplicated is one who cannot get a school in 
~ the county in which it was issued. Furthermore, if he teaches” 
-. in a given county it is his duty to attend the institute in that 
county, identify himself with the profession, learn the local con- 
ditions and take his examination in the county where he is to 
_ be employed. 
Hic Scuoo. CERTIFICATES, 
     
          Section 5, Chapter 264, Acts of 1909, provides that “all teach- 
ers in the public County High Schools receiving aid from this 
high school fund, under the provisions of this section’ of this act, 
shall be examined and licensed under regulations prescribed 
-by the State Board of Education, and said Board is hereby em-

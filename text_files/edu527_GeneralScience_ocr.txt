  PREFACE 
Tuts book is not intended to prepare for college entrance 
examinations; it will not, in fact, prepare for any of the 
present-day stock examinations in physics, chemistry, or 
hygiene, but it should prepare the thoughtful reader to meet 
wisely and actively some of life’s important problems, and 
should enable him to pass muster on the principles and 
theories underlying scientific, and therefore economic, man- 
agement, whether in the shop or in the home. 
We hear a great deal about the conservation of our natural 
resources, such as forests and waterways; it is hoped that 
this book will show the vital importance of the conservation 
of human strength and health, and the irreparable loss to 
society of energy uselessly dissipated, either in idle worry’ 
or in aimless activity. Most of us would reproach ourselves 
for lack of shrewdness if we spent for any article more than 
it was worth, yet few of us consider that we daily expend 
on domestic and business tasks an amount of energy far in 
excess of that actually required. The farmer who flails his 
grain instead of threshing it wastes time and energy; the 
housewife who washes with her hands alone and does not 
aid herself by the use of washing machine and proper bleach- 
ing agents dissipates energy sadly needed for other duties.

4 PREFACE 
The Chapter on machines is intended not only as a stimu- 
lus to the invention of further labor-saving devices, but also 
as an eye opener to those who, in the future struggle for 
existence, must perforce go to the wall unless they under- 
stand how to make use of contrivances whereby man’s limited 
physical strength is made effective for larger tasks. 
The Chapter on musical instruments is more detailed than 
seems warranted at first sight; but interest in orchestral 
instruments is real and general, and there is a persistent 
desire for intelligent information relative to musical instru- 
ments. The child of the laborer as well as the child of the 
merchant finds it possible to attend some of the weekly 
orchestral concerts, with their tiers of cheap seats, and noth- 
ing adds more to the enjoyment and instruction of such hours 
than an intimate acquaintance with the leading instruments. 
Unless this is given in the public schools, a large percentage 
of mankind is deprived of it, and it is for this reason that 
so large a share of the treatment of sound has been devoted 
to musical instruments. 
The treatment of electricity is more theoretical than that 
used in preceding Chapters, but the subject does not lend 
itself readily to popular presentation; and, moreover, it is 
assumed that the information and training acquired in the 
previous work will give the pupil power to understand the 
more advanced thought and method. 
The real value of a book depends not so much upon the 
information given as upon the permanent interest stimulated 
and the initiative aroused. The youthful mind, and indeed 
 
-P-A-G-E-5
  
  PREFACE 5 
the average adult mind as well, is singularly non-logical and 
incapable of continued concentration, and loses interest under 
too consecutive thought and sustained style. For this reason 
the author has sacrificed at times detail to general effect, 
logical development to present-day interest and facts, and 
has made use of a popular, light style of writing as well as 
of the more formal and logical style common to books of 
science. 
No claim is made to originality in subject matter. The 
actual facts, theories, and principles used are such as have 
been presented in previous textbooks of science, but the 
manner and sequence of presentation are new and, so far 
as I know, untried elsewhere. These are such as in my 
experience have aroused the greatest interest and initiative, 
and such as have at the same time given the maximum bene- 
fit from the informational standpoint. In no case, however, 
is mental training sacrificed to information; but mental de- 
velopment is sought through the student’s willing and inter- 
ested participation in the actual daily happenings of the 
home and the shop and the field, rather than through formal 
recitations and laboratory experiments. 
Practical laboratory work in connection with the study of 
this book is provided for in my Laboratory Manual in General 
Science, which contains directions for a series of experiments 
designed to make the pupil familiar with the facts and theo- 
ries discussed in the textbook. 
I have sought and have gained help from many of the 
standard textbooks, new and old. The following firms have

kindly placed cuts at my disposal, and have thus materially 
aided in the preparation of the illustrations: American Radi- 
ator Company; Commercial Museum, Philadelphia; General 
Electric Company; Hershey Chocolate Company ; Scéentific 
American; The Goulds Manufacturing Company; Victor 
Talking Machine Company. Acknowledgment is also due 
to Professor Alvin Davison for figures 19, 23, 29, 142, 
and 161. ; 
Mr. W. D. Lewis, Principal of the William Penn High 
School, has read the manuscript and has given me the benefit 
of his experience and interest. Miss Helen Hill, librarian 
of the same school, has been of invaluable service as regards 
suggestions and proof reading. Miss Droege, of the Baldwin 
School, Bryn Mawr, has also been of very great service. 
Practically all of my assistants have given of their time and 
skill to the preparation of the work, but the list is too long 
for individual mention.

CHAPTER 1 
HEAT 
1. Value of Fire. Every day, uncontrolled fire wipes out 
human lives and destroys vast amounts of property; every 
day, fire, controlled and regulated in stove and furnace, cooks 
our food and warms our houses. Fire melts ore and allows 
of the forging of iron, as in the blacksmith’s shop, and of the 
fashioning of innumerable objects serviceable to man. Heated 
boilers change water into the steam which drives our engines 
on land and sea. Heat causes rain and wind, fog and cloud; 
heat enables vegetation to grow and thus indirectly provides 
our food. Whether heat comes directly from the sun or from 
artificial sources such as coal, wood, oil, or electricity, it is 
vitally connected with our daily life, and for this reason the 
facts and theories relative to it are among the most important 
that can be studied. Heat, if properly regulated and con- 
trolled, would never be injurious to man; hence in the follow- 
ing paragraphs heat will be considered merely in its helpful 
capacity. 
2. General Effect of Heat. Expansion and Contraction. 
One of the best-known effects of heat is the change which 
it causes in the size of a substance. Every housewife knows 
that if a kettle is filled with cold water to begin with, there 
will be an overflow as soon as the water becomes heated. 
Heat causes not only water, but all other liquids, to occupy 
a
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 ' HEAT 
more space, or to éxpand, and in some cases the expansion, 
or increase in size, is surprisingly large. For example, if 
100 pints of ice water is heated in a kettle, the 100 pints 
will steadily expand until, at the boiling point, it will occupy 
as much space as 104 pints of ice water. 
The expansion of water can be easily shown by heating 
a flask (Fig. 1) filled with water and closed by a cork through 
which a narrow tube passes. As the water is 
heated, it expands and forces its way up the 
narrow tube. If the heat is removed, the liquid 
= cools, contracts, and slowly falls in the tube, 
| resuming in time its original size or volume. A 
similar observation can be made with alcohol, 
mercury, or any other convenient liquid. 
Not only liquids are affected by heat and 
cold, but solids also are subject to similar 
changes. A metal ball which when cool will

cold weather, and in winter they would snap. 
Air expands greatly when heated (Fig. 3), but since air is 
practically invisible, we are not ordinarily conscious of any 
change in it. The expansion of air can be readily shown by 
putting a drop of ink in a thin glass tube, inserting the tube

  EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION Il 
in the cork of a flask, and applying heat to the flask (Fig. 4). 
The ink is forced up the tube by the expanding air. Even 
the warmth of the hand is generally 
sufficient to cause the drop to rise 
steadily inthe tube. The rise of the 
drop of ink shows that the air in the 
flask occupies more space than for- 
merly, and since the quantity of air 
has not changed, each cubic inch of 
space must hold less warm air than 
it held of cold air; that is, one cubic | 
inch of warm air weighs less than one 
cubic inch of cold air, or warm air is 
less dense than cold air. All gases, if Fic.3.—As the air in 4 is heated,

Heat, in general, causes substances to expand 
or become less dense. 
3. Amount of Expansion and Contraction. 
While most substances expand when heated 
and contract when cooled, they are not all 
affected equally by the same changes in tem- 
perature. Alcohol expands more than water, 
and water more than mercury. Steel wire 
which measures + mile on a snowy day will 
gain 25 inches in length on a warm summer 
J day, and an aluminum wire under the same

wagon wheel is made slightly smaller than the wheel which

it is to protect; it is then put into a very hot fire and heated 
until it has expanded sufficiently to slip on the wheel. As 
the tire cools it contracts and fits the wheel closely. 
In a railroad, spaces are usually left between consecutive 
rails in order to allow for expansion during the summer. 
The unsightly cracks and humps in cement floors are some- 
times due to the expansion resulting from heat (Fig. 5). 
Cracking from this 
cause can frequently 
be avoided by cutting 
the soft cement into

portunity for expansion 
just as do the spaces between the rails of railroads. 
In the construction of long wire fences provision must be 
made for tightening the wire in summer, otherwise great sag- 
ging would occur. 
Heat plays an important part in the splitting of rocks and 
in the formation of débris. Rocks in exposed places are 
greatly affected by changes in temperature, and in regions 
where the changes in temperature are sudden, severe, and 
frequent, the rocks are not able to withstand the strain of 
expansion and contraction, and as a result crack and split. 
In the Sahara Desert much crumbling of the rock into sand 
has been caused by the intense heat of the day followed 
by the sharp frost of night. The heat of the day causes 
the rocks to expand, and the cold of night causes them to 
contract, and these two forces constantly at work loosen the 
grains of the rock and force them out of place, thus producing 
crumbling. 
The surface of the rock is the most exposed part, and 
during the day the surface, heated by the sun’s rays, expands 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION 13 
and becomes too large for 
the interior, and’ crumbling 
and splitting result from 
the strain. With the sud- 
den fall of temperature in 
the late afternoon and 
night, the surface of the 
rock becomes greatly 
chilled and colder than the 
rock beneath; the surface 
rock therefore contracts 
and shrinks more than the 
underlying rock, and again 
crumbling results (Fig. 
  6). Fic, 6.— Splitting and crumbling of rock On bare mountains, the caused by alternating heat and cold. 
heating and cooling effects of the sun are very striking (Fig. 7); 
the surface of many a 
mountain peak is cov-

or step will dislodge the 
fragments and __ start 
them down the moun- 
tain slope. The lower

5. Temperature. When an object feels hot to the touch, 
we say that it has a high temperature; when it feels cold to 
the touch, that it has a low temperature; but we are not 
accurate judges of heat. Ice water seems comparatively 
warm after eating ice cream, and yet we know that ice water 
is by no means warm. A room may seem warm to a person 
who has been walking in the cold air, while it may feel 
decidedly cold to some one who has come from a 
warmer room. If the hand is cold, lukewarm water 
feels hot, but if the hand has been in very hot water 
and is then transferred to lukewarm water, the latter 
will seem cold. We see that the sensation or feeling 
of warmth is not an accurate guide to the tempera- 
ture of a substance; and yet until 1592, one hundred 
years after the discovery of America, people relied 
solely upon their sensations for the measurement of 
temperature. Very hot substances cannot be touched 
without injury, and hence inconvenience as well as 
the necessity for accuracy led to the invention of 
the thermometer, an instrument whose operation 
depends upon the fact that most substances expand 
when heated and contract when cooled. 
6. The Thermometer. The modern thermometer 
consists of a giass tube at the lower end of which is 
a bulb filled with mercury or colored alcohol (Fig. 
8). After the bulb has been filled with the mer- Fic. 8. — eee .

Erne is heated by a Bunsen burner. As the water be- 
comes warmer and warmer the level of the mercury 
in the tube steadily rises until the water boils, when the level 
remains stationary (Fig. 9). .A scratch is made on the tube to 
indicate the point. to which the mercury rises when the bulb 
is placed in boiling water, and this point is marked 212°.
-P-A-G-E-15
  SOME USES OF A THERMOMETER 15 
The tube is then removed from the boiling water, and after 
cooling for a few minutes, it is placed in a vessel containing 
finely chopped ice (Fig. 10). The mercury 
column falls rapidly, but finally remains 
stationary, and at this level another 
scratch is made on the tube and the point 
is marked 32°. The space between these 
two points, which represent the tempera- 
tures of boiling water and of melting ice, 
is divided into 180 equal parts called de- 
grees. The thermometer in use in the 
United States is marked in this way and 
is called the Fahrenheit thermometer 
after its designer. Before the degrees 
are etched on the thermometer the open 
end of the tube is sealed. 
The Centigrade ther- Fic.9.— Determining one 
mometer, in use in foreign _ of the fixed points of a thermometer, 
countries and in all scien- 
tific work, is similar to the Fahrenheit except 
that the fixed points are’marked 100° and 0°, 
and the interval between the points is divided 
into 100 equal parts instead of into 180. 
The boiling point of water is 212° F. or 
100° C. 
The melting point of ice is 32° F. or 0° C.

7. Some Uses of a Thermometer. One of the chief values 
of a thermometer is the service it has rendered to medicine. 
If a thermometer is held for a few minutes ‘under the tongue 
of a normal, healthy person, the mercury will rise to about

98:4° F. If the temperature of the body regis- 
ters several degrees above or below this point, a 
physician should be consulted immediately. The 
temperature of the body is a trustworthy indica- 
tor of general physical condition; hence in all 
hospitals the temperature of patients is carefully 
taken at stated intervals. 
Commercially, temperature readings are ex- 
tremely important. In sugar refineries the tem- 
perature of the heated liquids is observed most 
carefully, since a difference in temperature, how- 
ever slight, affects not only the general appearance 
of sugars and sirups, but the quality as well. 
The many varieties of steel likewise show the in- 
fluence which heat may have on the nature of a 
substance. By observation and tedious experi- 
mentation it has been found that if hardened steel 
is heated to about 450° F. and quickly cooled, it 
gives the fine cutting edge of razors; if it is heated 
to about 500° F. and then cooled, the metal is much 
coarser and is suitable for shears and farm imple- 
ments; while if it is heated but 50° F. higher; 
that is, to 550° F., it gives the fine elastic steel 
of watch springs. 
A thermometer could be put to good use in every 
kitchen; the inexperienced housekeeper who can- 
not judge of the “heat” of the oven would be 
saved bad bread, etc., if the thermometer were a 
part of her equipment. The thermometer can 
also be used in detecting adulterants. Butter 
should melt at 94° F.; if it does not, you may be 
sure that it is adulterated with suet or other 
cheap fat. Olive oil should be a clear liquid
-P-A-G-E-17
METHODS OF HEATING BUILDINGS 17 
above 75° F.; if, above this temperature, it looks cloudy, 
you may be sure that it too is adulterated with fat. 
8. Methods of Heating Buildings. Open Fireplaces and 
Stoves. Before the time of stoves and furnaces, man heated 
his modest dwelling by open fires alone. The burning logs 
gave warmth to the cabin and served as a primitive cooking 
agent; and the smoke which usually accompanies burning 
bodies was carried away by means of the chimney. But in 
an open fireplace much heat escapes with the smoke 
and is lost, and only a 
small portion streams into 
the roomand gives warmth. 
When fuel is placed in 
an open fireplace (Fig. 12) 
and lighted, the air im- 
mediately surrounding the 
fire becomes warmer and, 
because of expansion, be- 
comes lighter than the cold 
air above. The cold air, be- 
ing heavier, falls and forces 
the warmer air upward, 
and along with the warm 
air goes the disagreeable 
smoke. The fall of the Fic. 12.—The open fireplace as an early 
colder and heavier air, ey 
and the rise of the warmer and hence lighter air, is similar to 
the exchange which takes place when water is poured on oil; 
the water, being heavier than oil, sinks to the bottom and 
forces the oil to the surface. The warmer air which escapes 
up the chimney carries with it the disagreeable smoke, and 
when all the smoke is got rid of in this way, the chimney is 
said to draw well.

  18 HEAT 
As the air is heated by the fire it expands, and is pushed up 
the chimney by the cold air which is constantly entering through 
loose windows and doors. Open fireplaces are very healthful 
because the air which is driven out is impure, while the air 
which rushes in is fresh and brings oxygen to the human being. 
But open fireplaces, while pleasant to look at, are not effi- 
cient for either heating or cooking. The possibilities for the 
latter are especially limited, and the invention of stoves wasa 
great advance in efficiency, economy, and comfort. A stove is 
a receptacle for fire, provided with a definite inlet for air and a 
definite outlet for smoke, and able to radiate into the room most 
of the heat produced from the fire which burns within. 
The inlet, or draft, admits enough air to cause the fire to burn 
brightly or slowly as the case may be. If we wish a hot fire, 
the draft is opened wide and enough air enters to produce a 
strong glow. If we wish a low fire, the inlet is only partially 
opened, and just enough air enters to keep the fuel smol- 
dering. 
When the fire is started, the damper should be opened 
wide in order to allow the escape of smoke; but after the 
fire is well started there is less smoke, and the damper may 
be partly closed. If the damper is kept open, coal is rapidly 
consumed, and the additional heat passes out through the 
chimney, and is lost to use. 
g. Furnaces. Hot Air. The labor involved in the care of 
numerous stoves is considerable, and hence the advent of a 
central heating stove, or furnace, was a great saving in 
strength and fuel. A furnace is a stove arranged as in 
Figure 13. The stove S, like all other stoves, has an inlet 
for air and an outlet C for smoke; but in addition, it has 
built around it a chamber in which air circulates and is 
warmed. The air warmed by the stove is forced upward by 
cold air which enters from outside. For example, cold air
-P-A-G-E-19
  HOT WATER 19 
constantly entering at Z drives the air heated by S through 
pipes and ducts to the rooms to be heated. 
The metal pipes which convey the heated air from the 
furnace to the ducts 
are sometimes covered 
with felt, asbestos, or 
other non-conducting 
material in order that 
heat may not be lost 
during transmission. 
The ducts which receive 
the heated air from the 
pipes are built in the 
non-conducting walls 
of the house, and hence 
lose practically no heat. 
The air which reaches 
halls and rooms is 
therefore warm, in 
spite of its long journey from the cellar. 
Not only houses are warmed by a central heating stove, 
but whole communities sometimes depend upon a central 
heating plant. In the latter case, pipes closely wrapped with 
a non-conducting material carry steam long distances under- 
ground to heat remote buildings. Overbrook and Radnor, 
Pa., are towns in which such a system is used. 
10. Hot-water Heating. The heated air which rises from 
furnaces is seldom hot enough to warm large buildings well ; 
hence furnace heating is being largely supplanted by hot- 
water heating. 
The principle of hot-water heating is shown by the follow- 
ing simple experiment. Two flasks and two tubes are 
arranged as in Figure 15, the upper flask containing a colored 
  FIG. 13.—A furnace. Pipes conduct hot air to the 
rooms,
-P-A-G-E-20

liquid and the lower flask clear water. If heat is applied to 
B, one can see at the end of a few seconds the downward 
  Fi, 14, — Hot-water heating,
-P-A-G-E-21

circulation of the colored liquid and the upward circulation of 
the clear water. If we represent a boiler by 4, a radiator by 
the coiled tube, and a safety tank by C, we shall have a very 
fair illustration of the principle of a hot-water heating system. 
The hot water in the radiators cools and, in cooling, gives up 
its heat to the rooms and thus warms them. 
In hot-water heating systems, fresh air is not brought to 
the rooms, for the radia- 
tors are closed pipes con- 
taining hot water. It is 
largely for this reason 
that thoughtful people 
are careful to raise win- 
dows at intervals. Some 
systems of hot-water heat- 
ing secure ventilation by 
confining the radiators to 
the basement, to which 
cold air from outside is 
constantly admitted in 
such a way that it circu- 
lates over the radiators 
and becomes _ strongly 
heated. This warm fresh 
air then passes through 
ordinary flues to the 
rooms above. = 
In Figure 16, a radiator Fic. 13.— The principle of hot-water heating. 
is shown in a_boxlike 
structure in the cellar. Fresh air from outside enters a flue 
at the right, passes the radiator, where it is warmed, and then 
makes its way to the room through a flue at the left. The 
warm air which thus enters the room is thoroughly fresh.     
 
-P-A-G-E-22
22 HEAT 
The actual labor involved in furnace heating and in hot-water 
heating is practically the same, since coal must be fed to the 
  Fic. 16,— Fresh air trom outside circulates over the radiators and then rises into the 
rooms to be heated, 
fire, and ashes must be removed; but the hot-water system 
has the advantage of economy and cleanliness. 
11. Fresh Air. Fresh air is essential to normal healthy 
living, and 2000 cubic feet of air per hour is desirable for 
each individual. Ifa gentle breeze is blowing, a barely per- 
ceptible opening of a window will give the needed amount, 
even if there are no additional drafts of fresh air into the room 
through cracks. Most houses are so loosely constructed that 
fresh air enters imperceptibly in many ways, and whether we 
will or no, we receive some fresh air. The supply is, how- 
ever, never sufficient in itself and should not be depended 
upon alone. At night, or at any other time when gas lights 
are required, the need for ventilation increases, because every 
gas light in a room uses up the same amount of air as four 
people.

24 HEAT 
In the preceding Section, we learned that many houses 
heated by hot water are supplied with fresh-air pipes which 
admit fresh air into separate rooms or into suites of rooms. 
In some cases the amount which enters is so great that the 
air in a room is changed three or four times an hour. The 
constant inflow of cold air and exit of warm air necessitates 
larger radiators and more hot water and hence more coal to 
heat the larger quantity of water, but the additional expense 
is more than compensated by the gain in health. 
12. Winds and Currents. The gentlest summer breezes 
and the fiercest blasts of winter are produced by the unequal 
heating of air. We have seen that the air nearest to a stove 
or hot object becomes hotter than the adjacent air, that it 
tends to expand and is replaced and pushed upward and 
outward by colder, heavier air falling downward. We have 
learned also that the moving liquid or gas carries with it heat 
which it gradually gives out to surrounding bodies. 
When a liquid or a gas moves away from a hot object, 
carrying heat with it, the process is called convection. 
Convection is responsible for winds and ocean currents, 
for land and sea breezes, and other daily phenomena. 
The Gulf Stream illustrates the transference of heat by 
convection. A large body of water is strongly heated at the 
equator, and then moves away, carrying heat with it to dis- 
tant regions, such as England and Norway. 
Owing to the shape of the earth and its position with 
respect to the sun, different portions of the earth are un- 
equally heated. In those portions where the earth is greatly 
heated, the air likewise will be heated; there will be a 
tendency for the air to rise, and for the cold air from sur- 
rounding regions to rush in to fill its ‘place. In this way 
winds are produced. There are many circumstances which 
modify winds and currents, and it is not always easy to ex-
-P-A-G-E-25
    
CONDUCTION 25 
plain their direction and velocity, but one very definite cause 
is the unequal heating of the surface of the earth. 
13. Conduction. A poker used in stirring a fire becomes 
hot and heats the hand grasping the poker, although only 
the opposite end of the poker has actually been in the fire. 
Heat from the fire passed into the poker, traveled along it, 
and warmed it. When heat flows in this way from a warm 
part of a body to a colder part, the process is called conduc- 
tion. A flatiron is heated by conduction, the heat from the 
warm stove passing into the cold flatiron and gradually heat- 
ing it. 
In convection, air and water circulate freely, carrying heat 
with them; in conduction, heat flows from a warm region 
toward a cold region, but there is no apparent motion of any 
kind. 
Heat travels more readily through some substances than 
through others. All metals conduct heat well; irons placed 
on the fire become heated throughout and cannot be grasped 
with the bare hand; iron utensils are frequently made with 
wooden handles, because wood is a poor conductor and 
does not allow heat from the iron to pass through it to the 
hand. For the same reason a burning match may be held 
without discomfort until the flame almost reaches the hand. 
Stoves and radiators are made of metal, because metals 
conduct heat readily, and as fast as heat is generated within 
the stove by the burning of fuel, or introduced into the 
radiator by the hot water, the heat is conducted through 
the metal and escapes into the room. 
Hot-water pipes and steam pipes are usually wrapped 
witha non-conducting substance, or insulator, such as asbestos, 
in order that the heat may not escape, but shall be retained 
within the pipes until it reaches the radiators within the 
rooms. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 HEAT 
The invention of the “ Fireless Cooker” depended in part 
upon the principle of non-conduction. Two vessels, one inside 
the other, are separated by sawdust, asbestos, or other poor con- 
ducting material (Fig. 18). Foods are heated in the usual way 
to the boiling point or to a high temperature, and are then 
placed in the inner vessel. The heat of the food cannot 
escape through the 
non-conducting mate- 
rial which surrounds 
it, and hence remains 
in the food and slowly 
cooks it. 
A very interesting 
experiment for the 
testing of the efficacy 
of non-conductors may 
be easily performed. 
: Place hot water in a 
metal vessel, and note by means of a thermometer the rapid- 
ity with which the water cools; then place water of the same 
temperature in a second metal vessel similar to the first, but 
surrounded by asbestos or other non-conducting material, - 
and note the s/owmess with which the temperature falls. 
Chemical Change, an Effect of Heat. This effect of heat 
has a vital influence on our lives, because the changes which 
take place when food is cooked are due to it. The doughy 
mass which goes into the oven, comes out a light spongy loaf ; 
the small indigestible rice grain comes out the swollen, fluffy, 
digestible grain. Were it not for the chemical changes 
brought about by heat, many of our present foods would be 
useless to man. Hundreds of common materials like glass, 
rubber, iron, aluminum, etc., are manufactured by processes 
which involve chemical action caused by heat.

CHAPTER II 
TEMPERATURE AND HEAT 
14. Temperature not a Measure of the Amount of Heat 
Present. If two similar basins containing unequal quantities 
of water are placed in the sunshine on a summer day, the 
smaller quantity of water will become quite warm in a short 
period of time, while the larger quantity will become only 
lukewarm. Both vessels receive the same amount of heat 
from the sun, but in one case the heat is utilized in heating 
to a high temperature a small quantity of water, while in the 
second case the heat is utilized in warming to a lower degree 
a larger quantity of water. Equal amounts of heat do not 
necessarily produce equivalent temperatures, and equal tem- 
peratures do not necessarily indicate equal amounts of heat. 
It takes more heat to raise a gallon of water to the boiling 
point than it does to raise a pint of water to the boiling point, 
but a thermometer would register the same temperature in 
the two cases. The temperature of boiling water is 100° C. 
whether there is a pint of it ora gallon. Temperature is in- 
dependent of the quantity of matter present; but the amount 
of heat contained in a substance at any temperature is not in- 
dependent of quantity, being greater in the larger quantity. 
- 15. The Unit of Heat. It is necessary to have a unit of 
heat just as we have a unit of length, or a unit of mass, or a 
unit of time. One unit of heat is called a calorie, and is the 
amount of heat which will change the temperature of 1 gram 
of water1°C. It is the amount of heat given out by 1 gram 
of water when its temperature falls 1°C., or the amount of 
heat absorbed by 1 gram of water when its temperature rises 
1°C. If 400 grams of water are heated from 0° to 5°C., 
27
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 TEMPERATURE AND HEAT 
the amount of heat which has entered the water is equivalent 
to 5 x 400 or 2000 calories; if 200 grams of water cool from 
25° to 20°C., the heat given out by the water is equivalent 
to 5 X 200 or 1000 calories. 
16. Some Substances Heat more readily than Others. If two 
equal quantities of water at the same temperature are exposed 
to the sun for the same length of time, their final temperatures 
will be the same. If, however, equal quantities of different sub- 
stances are exposed, the temperatures resulting from the heat- 
ing will not necessarily be the same. If a basin containing 
1 Ib. of mercury is put on the fire, side by side with a basin 
containing an equal quantity of water, the temperatures of 
the two substances will vary greatly at the end of a short 
time. The mercury will have a far higher temperature than 
the water, in spite of the fact that the amount of mercury is 
as great as the amount of water and that the heat received 
from the fire has been the same in each case. Mercury is 
not so difficult to heat as water; less heat being required to 
raise its temperature 1° than is required to raise the tempera- 
ture of an equal quantity of water 1°. In fact, mercury is 
30 times as easy to heat as water, and it requires only one 
thirtieth as much fire to heat a given quantity of mercury 1° 
as to heat the same quantity of water 1°. 
17. Specific Heat. We know that different substances are 
differently affected by heat. Some substances, like water, 
change their temperature slowly when heated; others, like 
mercury, change their temperature very rapidly when heated. 
The number of calories needed by 1 gram of a substance in 
order that its temperature may be increased 1°C. is called 
the specific heat of a substance ; or, specific heat is the num- 
ber of calories given out by 1 gram of a substance when its 
temperature falls 1°C. For experiments on the determina- 
tion of specific heat, see Laboratory Manual.
-P-A-G-E-29
  SOURCES OF HEAT ~ 29 
Water has the highest specific heat of any known sub- 
stance except hydrogen; that is, it requires more heat to 
raise the temperature of water a definite number of degrees 
than it does to raise the temperature of an equal amount of 
any other substance the same number of degrees. Practi- 
cally this same thing can be stated in another way: Water in 
cooling gives out more heat than any other substance in cool- 
ing through the same number of degrees. For this reason 
water is used in foot warmers and in hot-water bags. If 
a copper lid were used as a foot warmer, it would give the 
feet only .o95 as much heat as an equal weight of water; a 
lead weight only .0o31 as much heat as water. Flatirons are 
made of iron because of the relatively high specific heat of 
iron. The flatiron heats slowly and cools slowly, and, be- 
cause of its high specific heat, not only supplies the laundress 
with considerable heat, but eliminates for her the frequent 
changing of the flatiron. 
18. Water and Weather. About four times as much heat is 
, required to heat a given quantity of water one degree as to 
heat an equal quantity of earth. In summer, when the rocks 
and the sand along the shore are burning hot, the ocean and 
lakes are pleasantly cool, although the amount of heat pres- 
ent in the water is as great as that present in the earth. In 
winter, long after the rocks and sand have given out their 
heat and have become cold, the water continues to give out 
the vast store of heat accumulated during the summer. This 
explains why lands situated on or near large bodies of water 
usually have less variation in temperature than inland regions. 
In the summer the water cools the region; in the winter, on 
the contrary, the water heats the region, and hence extremes 
of temperature are practically unknown. 
19. Sources of Heat. Most of the heat which we enjoy 
and use we owe to the sun. The wood which blazes on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 TEMPERATURE AND HEAT 
hearth, the coal which glows in the furnace, and the oil which 
burns in the stove owe their existence to the sun. 
Without the warmth of the sun seeds could not sprout and 
develop into the mighty trees which yield firewood. Even 
coal, which lies buried thousands of feet below the earth’s 
surface, owes its existence in part to the sun. Coal is simply 
buried vegetation,— vegetation which sprouted and grew under 
the influence of the sun’s warm rays. Ages ago trees and 
bushes grew “thick and fast,” and the ground was always 
covered with a deep layer of decaying vegetable matter. In 
time some of this vast supply sank into the moist soil and 
became covered with mud. Then rock formed, and the rock 
pressed down upon the sunken vegetation. The constant 
pressure, the moisture in the ground, and heat affected the 
underground vegetable mass, and slowly changed it into coal. 
The buried forest and thickets were not all changed into 
coal. Some were changed into oil and gas. Decaying ani- 
mal matter was often mixed with the vegetable mass. When 
the mingled animal and vegetable matter sank into moist 
earth and came under the influence of pressure, it was slowly 
changed into oil and gas. 
The heat of our bodies comes from the foods which we eat. 
Fruits, grain, etc., could not’ grow without the warmth and 
the light of the sun. The animals which supply our meats 
likewise depend upon the sun for light and warmth. 
The sun, therefore, is the great source of heat; whether it 
is the heat which comes directly from the sun and warms the 
atmosphere, or the heat which comes from burning coal, 
wood, and oil.

CHAPTER III 
OTHER FACTS ABOUT HEAT 
20. Boiling. Heat absorbed in Boiling. Vf a kettle of 
water is placed above a flame, the temperature of the water 
gradually increases, and soon small bubbles form at the bot- 
tom of the kettle and begin to rise through the water. At 
first the bubbles do not get far in their ascent, but disappear 
before they reach the surface; later, as the water gets hotter 
and hotter, the bubbles become larger and more numerous, 
rise higher and higher, and finally reach the surface and 
pass from the water intothe air; steam comes from the vessel, 
and the water is said to doz/. The temperature at which a 
liquid boils is called the boiling point. 
While the water is heating, the temperature steadily rises, 
but as soon as the water begins to boil the thermometer read- 
ing becomes stationary and does not change, no matter how 
hard the water boils and in spite of the fact that heat from 
the flame is constantly passing into the water. 
If the flame is removed from the boiling water for but a 
second, the boiling ceases; if the flame is replaced, the boil- 
ing begins again immediately. Unless heat is constantly 
supplied, water at the boiling point cannot be transformed 
into steam. 
The number of calories which must be supplied to 1 gram of 
water at the boiling point in order to change it into steam at 
the same temperature ts called the heat of vaporization ; it is 
the heat necessary to change 1 gram of water at the boiling 
point into steam of the same temperature. 
31
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 OTHER FACTS ABOUT HEAT 
21. The Amount of Heat Absorbed! The amount of heat 
which must be constantly supplied to water at the boiling point 
in order to change it into steam is far greater than we realize. 
If we put a beaker of ice water (water at 0° C.) over a 
steady flame, and note (1) the time which elapses before the 
water begins to boil, and (2) the time which elapses before 
the boiling water completely boils away, we shall see that it 
takes about 5} times as long to change water into steam as it 
does to change its temperature from 0° C. to 100°C. Since, 
with a steady: flame, it takes 5} times as long to change water 
into steam as it does to change its temperature from o° C. 
to the boiling point, we conclude that it takes 5} times as 
much heat to convert water at the boiling point into steam as 
it does to raise it from the temperature of ice water to that of 
boiling water. 
The amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 
I gram of water 1° C.is equal to 1 calorie, and the amount 
necessary to raise the temperature 100° C. is equal to 100 
calories; hence the amount of heat necessary to convert 
I gram of water at the boiling point into steam at that same 
temperature is equal to approximately 525 calories. Very 
careful experiments show the exact heat of vaporization to 
be 536.1 calories. (See Laboratory Manual.) 
22. General Truths. Statements similar to the above hold 
for other liquids and for solutions. If milk. is placed upon a 
stove, the temperature rises steadily until the boiling point is 
reached ; further heating produces, not a change in tempera- 
ture, but a change of the water of the milk into steam. As 
soon as the milk, or any other liquid food, comes to a boil, 
the gas flame should be lowered until only an occasional 
bubble forms, because so long as any bubbles form the tem- 
perature is that of the boiling point, and further heat merely 
results in waste of fuel.
-P-A-G-E-33
  PRACTICAL APPLICATION 33 
We find by experiment that every liquid has its own spe- 
cific boiling point; for example, alcohol boils at 78° C. and 
brine at 103° C. Both specific heat and the heat of vaporiza- 
tion vary with the liquid used. 
23. Condensation. If one holds a cold lid in the steam of 
boiling water, drops of water gather on the lid; the steam is 
cooled by contact with the cold lid and condenses into water. 
Bottles of water brought from a cold cellar into a warm room 
become covered with a mist of fine drops of water, because 
the moisture in the air, chilled by contact with the cold 
bottles, immediately condenses into drops of water. Glasses 
filled with ice water show a similar mist. 
In Section 21, we saw that 536 calories are required to 
change 1 gram of water into steam; if, now, the steam in 
turn condenses into water, it is natural to expect a release of 
the heat used in transforming water into steam. Experiment 
shows not only that vapor gives out heat during condensation, 
but that the amount of heat thus set free is exactly equal to 
the amount absorbed during vaporization. (See Laboratory 
Manual.) 
We learn that the heat of vaporization is the same whether 
it is considered as the heat absorbed by 1 gram of water in 
its change to steam, or as the heat given out by 1 gram of 
steam during its condensation into water. 
24. Practical Application. We understand now the value of 
steam as a heating agent. Water is heated in a boiler in the 
cellar, and the steam passes through pipes which run to the 
various rooms; there the steam condenses into water in the radi- 
ators, each gram of steam setting free 536 calories of heat. 
When we consider the size of the radiators and the large num- 
ber of grams of steam which they contain, and consider fur- 
ther that each gram in condensing sets free 536 calories, we 
understand the ease with which buildings are heated by steam. 
CL, GEN, SCI. —3
-P-A-G-E-34
  34 OTHER FACTS ABOUT HEAT 
Most of us have.at times profited by the heat of condensa- 
tion. In cold weather, when there is a roaring fire in the 
range, the water frequently becomes so hot that it “steams” 
out of open faucets. If, at such times, the hot water is turned 
on in a small cold bathroom, and is allowed to run until the 
tub is well filled, vapor condenses on windows, mirrors, and 
walls, and the cold room becomes perceptibly warmer. The 
heat given out by the condensing steam passes into the sur- 
“ rounding air and warms the room. 
There is, however, another reason for the rise in tempera- 
ture. If a large pail of hot soup is placed in a larger pail of 
cold water, the soup will gradually cool and the cold water 
will gradually become warmer. A red-hot iron placed on a 
stand gradually cools, but warms the stand. A hot body 
loses heat so long as a cooler body is near it; the cold object 
is heated at the expense of the warmer object, and one loses 
heat and the other gains heat until the temperature of both is 
the same. Now the hot water in the tub gradually loses heat 
and the cold air of the room gradually gains heat by con- 
vection, but the amount given the room by convection is 
relatively small compared with the large amount set free by 
the condensing steam. 
25. Distillation. If impure, muddy water is boiled, drops 
of water will collect on a cold plate held in the path of the 
" steam, but the drops will be clear and pure. When impure 
water is boiled, the steam from it does not contain any of the 
impurities because these are left behind in the vessel. If all 
the water were allowed to boil away, a layer of mud or of 
other impurities would be found at the bottom of the vessel. 
Because of this fact, it is possible to purify water in a very 
simple way. Place over a fire a large kettle closed except for 
a spout which is long enough to reach across the stove and 
dip into a bottle. As the liquid boils, steam escapes through
-P-A-G-E-35
  EVAPORATION 35 
the spout, and on reaching the cold bottle condenses and 
drops into the bottle as pure water. The impurities remain 
behind in the kettle. Water freed from impurities in this way 
is called aéstilled water, and the process is called distillation 
(Fig. 19). By this method, the salt water of the ocean may be 
separated into pure 
drinking water and 
salt, and many of the 
large ocean liners 
distill from the briny 
deep all the drinking 
water used on their 
ocean voyages. 
Commercially, distil- 
lation is a very impor- 
tant process. Turpen- 
tine, for example, is 
  Biicensd FIG, 19.—In order that the steam which passes 
made by distilling the through the coiled tube may be quickly cooled and 
ine trees. In- condensed, cold water is made to circulate around 
nae of pine : the coil, The condensed steam escapes at w. 
cisions are cut in the 
bark of the long-leaf pine trees, and these serve as chan- 
nels for the escape of crude resin. This crude liquid is 
collected in barrels and taken to a distillery, where it is 
distilled into turpentine and rosin. The turpentine is the 
product which passes off as vapor, and the rosin is the mass 
left in the boiler after the distillation of the turpentine. 
26. Evaporation. If a stopper is left off a cologne bottle, 
the contents of the bottle will slowly evaporate; if a dish of 
water is placed out of doors on a hot day, evaporation occurs 
very rapidly. The liquids which have disappeared from the 
bottle and the dish have passed into the surrounding air in the 
form of vapor. In Section 20, we saw that water could not 
pass into vapor without the addition of heat; now the heat
-P-A-G-E-36
    36 OTHER FACTS ABOUT HEAT 
necessary for the evaporation of the cologne and water was 
taken from the air, leaving it slightly cooler. If wet hands 
are not dried with a towel, but are left to dry by evaporation, 
heat is taken from the hand in the process, leaving a sensa- 
tion of coolness. Damp clothing should never be worn, be- 
cause the moisture in it tends to evaporate at the expense of 
the bodily heat, and this undue loss of heat from the body 
produces chills. After a bath the body should be well rubbed, 
otherwise evaporation occurs at the expense of heat which 
the body cannot ordinarily afford to lose. 
Evaporation is a slow process occurring at all times; it is 
hastened during the summer, because of the large amount of 
heat present in the atmosphere. Many large cities make use 
of the cooling effect of evaporation to lower the temperature 
of the air in summer; streets are sprinkled not only to lay 
the dust, but in order that the surrounding air may be cooled 
by the evaporation of the water. 
Some thrifty housewives economize by utilizing the cooling 
effects of evaporation. Butter, cheese, and other foods sensi- 
tive to heat are placed in porous vessels wrapped in wet 
cloths. Rapid evaporation of the water from the wet cloths 
keeps the contents of the jars cool, and that without expense 
other than the muscular energy needed for wetting the cloths 
frequently. ; 
27. Rain, Snow, Frost, Dew. The heat of the sun causes 
constant evaporation of the waters of oceans, rivers, streams, 
and marshes, and the water vapor set free by evaporation 
passes into the air, which becomes charged with vapor or is 
said to be humid. Constant, unceasing evaporation of our 
lakes, streams, and pools would mean a steady decrease in 
the supply of water available for daily use, if the escaped water 
were all retained by the atmosphere and lost to the earth. 
But although the escaped vapor mingles with the atmosphere,
-P-A-G-E-37
  
  RAIN, SNOW, FROST, DEW 37 
hovering near the earth’s surface, or rising far above the 
level of the mountains, it does not remain there permanently. 
When this vapor meets a cold wind or is chilled in any way, 
condensation takes place, and a mass of tiny drops of water 
or of small particles of snow is formed. When these drops 
or particles become large enough, they fall to the earth as 
rain or snow, and in this way the earth is compensated for 
the great loss of moisture due to evaporation. Fog is formed 
when vapor condenses near the surface of the earth, and when 
the drops are so small that they do not fall but hover in the 
air, the fog is said “not to lift” or “not to clear.” 
If ice water is poured into a glass, a mist will form on the 
outside of the glass. This is because the water vapor in the 
air becomes chilled by contact with the glass and condenses. 
Often leaves and grass and sidewalks are so cold that the 
water vapor in the atmosphere condenses on them, and we 
say a heavy dew has formed. If the temperature of the air 
falls to the freezing point while the dew is forming, the vapor 
is frozen and frost is seen instead of dew. 
The daily evaporation of moisture into the atmosphere 
keeps the atmosphere more or less full of water vapor; but 
the atmosphere can hold only a definite amount of vapor at 
a given temperature, and as soonas it contains the maximum 
amount for that temperature, further evaporation ceases. If 
clothes are hung out on a damp, murky day they do not 
dry, because the air contains all the moisture it can hold, 
and the moisture in the clothes has no chance to evaporate. 
When the air contains all the moisture it can hold, it is said 
to be saturated, and if a slight fall in temperature occurs 
when the air is saturated, condensation immediately begins 
in the form of rain, snow, or fog. If, however, the air is 
not saturated, a fall in temperature may occur without 
producing precipitation. The temperature at which air is  
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 OTHER FACTS ABOUT HEAT 
saturated and condensation begins is called the dew 
point. 
28. How Chills are Caused. The discomfort we feel in an 
overcrowded room is partly due to an excess of moisture in 
the air, resulting from the breathing and perspiration of 
many persons. The air soon becomes saturated with vapor 
and cannot take away the perspiration from our bodies, and 
our clothing becomes moist and our skin tender. _When we 
leave the crowded “tea” or lecture and pass into the colder, 
drier, outside air, clothes and skin give up their load of mois- 
ture through sudden evaporation. But evaporation requires 
heat, and this heat is taken from our bodies, and a chill results. 
Proper ventilation would eliminate much of the physical 
danger of social events; fresh, dry air should be constantly 
admitted to crowded rooms in order to replace the air satu- 
rated by the breath and perspiration of the occupants. 
29. Weather Forecasts. When the air is near the satura- 
tion point, the weather is oppressive and is said to be very 
humid. For comfort and health, the air should be about 
two thirds saturated. The presence of some water vapor in 
the air is absolutely necessary to animal and plant life. In 
desert regions where vapor is scarce the air is so dry that 
throat trouble accompanied by disagreeable tickling is preva- 
lent; fallen leaves become so dry that they crumble to dust; 
plants lose their freshness and beauty. 
The likelihood of rain or frost is often determined by tem- 
perature and humidity. If the air is near saturation and the 
temperature is falling, it is safe to predict bad weather, be- 
cause the fall of temperature will probably cause rapid con- 
densation, and hence rain. If, however, the air is not near 
the saturation point, a fall in temperature will not necessarily 
produce bad weather. 
The measurement of humidity is of far wider importance
-P-A-G-E-39
  HEAT NEEDED TO MELT SUBSTANCES 39 
than the mere forecasting of local weather conditions. The 
close relation between humidity and health has led many 
institutions, such as hospitals, schools, and factories, to regu- 
late the humidity of the atmosphere as carefully as they do 
the temperature. Too great humidity is enervating, and not 
conducive to either mental or physical exertion ; on the other 
hand, too dry air is equally harmful. In summer the humid- 
ity conditions cannot be well regulated, but in winter, when 
houses are artificially heated, the humidity of a room can be 
increased by placing pans of water near the registers or on 
radiators. 
30. Heat Needed to Melt Substances. If a spoon is placed 
in a vessel of hot water for a few seconds and then removed, 
it will be warmer than before it was placed in the hot water. 
If a lump of melting ice is placed in the vessel of hot water 
and then removed, the ice will not be warmer than before, 
but there will be less of it. The heat of the water has been 
used in melting the ice, not in changing its temperature. 
If, on a bitter cold day, a pail of snow is brought into a 
warm room and a thermometer is placed in the snow, the 
temperature rises gradually until 32° F. is reached, when it 
becomes stationary, and the snow begins to melt. If the pail 
is put on the fire, the temperature still remains 32° F., but the 
snow melts more rapidly. As soon as all the snow is com- 
pletely melted, however, the temperature begins to rise and 
rises steadily until the water boils, when it again becomes sta- 
tionary and remains so during the passage of water into vapor. 
We see that heat must be supplied to ice at o°C. or 32° 
F. in order to change it into water, and further, that the 
temperature of the mixture does not rise so long as any ice is 
present, no matter how much heat is supplied. The amount 
of heat necessary to melt 1 gram of ice is easily calculated. 
(See Laboratory Manual.)

  40 OTHER FACTS ABOUT HEAT 
Heat must be supplied to ice to melt it. Onthe other hand, 
water, in freezing, loses heat, and the amount of heat lost by 
freezing water is exactly equal to the amount of heat absorbed 
by melting ice. 
The number of units of heat required to elk a unit mass 
of ice is called the Leat of fusion of water. 
31. Climate. Water, in freezing, loses heat, even though its 
temperature remains at 0° C. Because water loses heat when 
it freezes, the presence of large streams of water greatly in- 
fluences the climate of a region. In winter the heat from 
the freezing water keeps the temperature of the surrounding 
air higher than it would naturally be, and consequently the 
cold weather is less severe. In summer water evaporates, 
heat is taken from the air, and consequently the warm weather 
is less intense. 
32. Molding of Glass and Forging of Iron. The fire which 
is hot enough to melt a lump of ice may not be hot enough 
to melt an iron poker; on the other hand, it may be suffi- 
ciently hot to melt a tin spoon. Different substances melt, 
or liquefy, at different temperatures; for example, ice melts 
at 0° C, and tin at 233° C., while iron requires the relatively 
high temperature of 1200°C. Most substances have a definite 
melting or freezing point which never changes so long as the 
surrounding conditions remain the same. 
But while most substances have a definite melting point, 
some substances do not. If a glass rod is held in a Bunsen 
burner, it will gradually grow softer and softer, and finally a 
drop of molten glass will fall from the end of the rod into 
the fire. The glass did not suddenly become a liquid at a 
definite temperature ; instead it softened gradually, and then 
melted. While glass is in the soft, yielding, pliable state, it 
is molded into dishes, bottles, and other useful objects, such as 
lamp shades, globes, etc. (Fig. 20). If glass melted at a definite
-P-A-G-E-41
  STRANGE BEHAVIOR OF WATER 41 
temperature, it could not be molded in this way. Iron acts 
in a similar manner, and because of this property the black- 
smith can shape his horseshoes, and the workman can make 
his engines and other articles of daily service to man. 
  
  FIG. 20. — Molten glass being rolled into a form suitable for window panes. 
33. Strange Behavior of Water. One has but to remember 
that bottles of water burst when they freeze, and that 
ice floats on water like wood, to know that water expands 
on freezing or on solidifying. A quantity of water which 
occupies 100 cubic feet of space will, on becoming ice, need 
109 cubic feet of space. On a cold winter night the water 
sometimes freezes in the water pipes, and the pipes burst. 
Water is very peculiar in expanding on solidification, be- 
cause most substances contract on solidifying; gelatin and 
jelly, for example, contract so much that they shrink from the 
sides of the dish which contains them. 
If water contracted in freezing, ice would be heavier than 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 OTHER FACTS ABOUT HEAT 
water and would sink in ponds and lakes as fast as it formed, 
and our streams and ponds would become masses of solid ice, 
killing all animal and plant life. But the ice is lighter than 
water and floats on top, and animals in the water beneath are 
as free to live and swim as they were in the warm sunny 
days of summer. -The most severe winter cannot freeze a 
deep lake solid, and in the coldest weather a hole made in 
the ice will show water beneath the surface. Our ice boats 
cut and break the ice of the river, and through the water 
beneath our boats daily ply their way to and fro, independent 
of winter and its blighting blasts. 
While most of us are familiar with the bursting of water 
pipes on a cold night, few of us realize the influence which 
freezing water exerts on the character of the land around us. 
Water sinks into the ground and, on the approach of 
winter, freezes, expanding about one tenth of its volume; the 
expanding ice pushes the earth aside, the force in some cases 
being sufficient to dislodge even huge rocks. In the early 
days in New England it was said by the farmers that “rocks 
grew,” because fields cleared of stones in the fall became 
rock covered with the approach of spring; the rocks and stones 
hidden underground and unseen in the fall were forced to the 
surface by the winter’s expansion. We have all seen fence 
posts and bricks pushed out of place because of the heaving 
of the soil beneath them. Often householders must re-lay 
their pavements and walks because of the damage done by 
freezing water. 
The most conspicuous effect of the expansive power of freez- 
ing water is seen in rocky or mountainous regions (Fig. 21). 
Water easily finds entrance into the cracks and crevices of 
the rocks, where it lodges until frozen; then it expands and 
acts like a wedge, widening cracks, chiseling off edges, and 
even breaking rocks asunder. In regions where frequent
-P-A-G-E-43
  HEAT NECESSARY TO DISSOLVE A SUBSTANCE 43 
frosts occur, the destructive action of water works constant 
changes in the appearance of the land; small cracks and 
crevices are enlarged, mas- 
sive rocks are pried up out 
of position, huge slabs are 
split off, and particles 
large and small are forced 
from the parent rock, The 
greater part of the débris 
and rubbish brought down 
from the mountain slopes 
by the spring rains owes its 
origin to the fact that water 
expands when it freezes. 
34. Heat Necessary to 
Dissolve a Substance. It 
requires heat to dissolve 
any substance, just as it 
requires heat to change F!6-2%—The destruction caused by freezing

ice to water. If ahandful 
of common salt is placed in a small cup of water and stirred 
with a thermometer, the temperature of the mixture falls sev- 
eral degrees. This is just what one would expect, because 
the heat needed to liquefy the salt must come from some- 
where, and naturally it comes from the water, thereby lower- 
ing the temperature of the water. We know very well that 
potatoes cease boiling if a pinch of salt is put in the water ; 
this is because the temperature of the water has been lowered 
by the amount of heat necessary to dissolve the salt. 
Let some snow or chopped ice be placed in a vessel and 
mixed with one third its weight of coarse salt; if then a small 
tube of cold water is placed in this mixture, the water in the test 
tube will soon freeze solid. As soon as the snow and salt 
   
-P-A-G-E-44
44 OTHER FACIS ABOUT HEAT 
are mixed they melt. The heat necessary for this comes in 
part from the air and in part from the water in the test tube, 
and the water in the tube becomes in consequence cold enough 
to freeze. But the salt mixture does not freeze because its 
freezing point is far below that of pure water. The use of, 
salt and ice in ice-cream freezers is a practical application of 
this principle. The heat necessary for melting the mixture 
of salt and ice is taken from the cream which thus becomes 
cold enough to freeze.

  CHAPTER *1V 
BURNING OR OXIDATION 
35. Why Things Burn. The Heat of our bodies comes 
from the food we eat; the heat for cooking and for warming 
our houses comes from coal. The production of heat through 
the burning of coal, or oil, or gas, or wood, is called com- 
bustion. Combustion cannot occur without the presence of 
a substance called oxygen, which exists rather abundantly 
in the air; that is, one fifth of our atmosphere consists of 
this substance. which we call oxygen. We throw open our 
windows to allow fresh air to enter, and we take walks in 
order to breathe the pure air into our lungs. What we need 
for the energy and warrhth of our bodies is the oxygen in 
the air. Whether we burn gas or wood or coal, the heat 
which is produced comes from the power which these various 
substances possess to combine with oxygen. We open the 
draft of a stove that it may “draw well”: that it may secure 
oxygen for burning. We throw a blanket over burning ma- 
terial to smother the'fire: to keep oxygen away fromit. Burn- 
ing, or oxidation, is combining with oxygen, and the more 
oxygen you add to a fire, the hotter the fire will burn, and the 
faster. The effect of oxygen on combustion may be clearly 
seen by thrusting a smoldering splinter into a jar containing 
oxygen; the smoldering splinter will instantly flare and blaze, 
while if it is removed from the jar, it loses its flame and again

burns quietly. Oxygen for this experiment can be produced 
in the following way. 
36. HowtoPrepareOxygen. Mix a small quantity of potas- 
sium chlorate with an equal amount of manganese dioxide 
and place the mixture in a strong test tube. Close the 
mouth of the tube with a one-hole rubber stopper in which 
is fitted a long, narrow tube, and clamp the test tube to an 
iron support, as shown in Figure 22. Fill the trough with 
    
            
    
  Fic. 22, — Preparing oxygen from potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide. 
water until the shelf is just covered and allow the end of the 
delivery tube to rest just beneath the hole in the shelf. 
Fill a medium-sized bottle with water, cover it with a glass 
plate, invert the bottle in the trough, and then remove the 
glass plate. Heat the test tube very gently, and when gas 
bubbles out of the tube, slip the bottle over the opening in 
the shelf, so that the tube runs into the bottle. The gas will 
force out the water and will finally fill the bottle. When all 
the water has been forced out, slip the glass plate under the 
mouth of the bottle and remove the bottle from the trough. 
The gas in the bottle is oxygen. 
Everywhere in a large city or in a small village, smoke is 
seen, indicating the presence of fire; hence there must exist a. 
large supply of oxygen to keep all the fires alive. The supply 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  SAFETY MATCHES 47 
of oxygen needed for the fires of the world comes largely from 
the atmosphere. 
37. Matches. The burning material is ordinarily set on 
fire by matches, thin strips of wood tipped with sulphur or 
phosphorus, or both. Phosphorus can unite with oxygen at 
a fairly low temperature, and if phosphorus is rubbed 
against a rough surface, the friction produced will raise the 
temperature of the phosphorus to a point where it can com- 
bine with oxygen. The burning phosphorus kindles the wood 
of the match, and from the burning match the fire is kindled. 
If you want to convince yourself that friction produces heat, 
rub a cent vigorously against your coat and note that the 
cent becomes warm. Matches have been in use less than a 
hundred years. Primitive man kindled his camp fire by 
rubbing pieces of dry wood together until they took fire, 
and this method is said to be used among some isolated 
distant tribes at the present time. A later and easier 
way was to strike flint and steel together and to catch the 
spark thus produced on tinder or dry fungus. Within the 
memory of some persons now living, the tinder box was a 
valuable asset to the home, particularly in the pioneer 
regions of the West. 
38. Safety Matches. Ordinary phosphorus, while excel- 
lent as a fire-producing material, is dangerously poisonous, 
and those to whom the dipping of wooden strips into phos- 
phorus is a daily occupation suffer with a terrible disease 
which usually attacks the teeth and bones of the jaw. The 
teeth rot and fall out, abscesses form, and bones and flesh 
begin to decay; the only way to prevent the spread of the 
disease is to remove the affected bone, and in some instances 
it has been necessary to remove the entire jaw. Then, too, 
matches made of yellow or white phosphorus ignite easily, 
and, when rubbed against any rough surface, are apt to take  
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 BURNING OR OXIDATION 
fire. Many destructive fires have been started by the ac- 
cidental friction of such matches against rough surfaces. 
For these reasons the introduction of the so-called safety 
match was an important event. When common phosphorus, 
in the dangerous and easily ignited form, is heated in a closed 
vessel to about 250°C., it gradually changes to a harmless 
red mass. The red phosphorus is not only harmless, but it is 
difficult to ignite, and, in order to be ignited by friction, must 
be rubbed on a surface rich in oxygen. The head of a safety 
match is coated with a mixture of glue and oxygen-contain- 
ing compounds; the surface on which the match is to be 
rubbed is coated with a mixture of red phosphorus and glue, 
to which finely powdered glass is sometimes added in order 
to increase the friction. Unless the head of the match is 
rubbed on the prepared phosphorus coating, ignition does not 
occur, and accidental fires are avoided. 
Various kinds of safety matches have been manufactured 
in the last few years, but they are somewhat more expensive 
than the ordinary form, and hence manufacturers are reluctant 
to substitute them for the cheaper matches. Some foreign 
countries, such as Switzerland, prohibit the sale of the 
dangerous type, and it is hoped that the United States will 
soon follow the lead of these countries in demanding the sale 
of safety matches only. 
39. Some Unfamiliar Forms of Burning. While most of 
us think of burning as a process in which flames and smoke 
occur, there are in reality many modes of burning accom- 
panied by neither flame nor smoke. Iron, for example, 
burns when it rusts, because it slowly combines with the 
oxygen of the air and is transformed into new substances. 
When the air is dry, iron does not unite with oxygen, but 
when moisture is present in the air, the iron unites with the 
oxygen and turns into ironrust. The burning is slow and un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  SOME UNFAMILIAR FORMS OF BURNING 49 
accompanied by the fire and smoke so familiar to us, but the 
process is none the less burning, or combination with oxygen. 
Burning which is not accompanied by any of the appearances 
of ordinary burning is known as oxidation. 
The tendency of iron to rust lessens its efficiency and 
value, and many devices have been introduced to prevent 
rusting. A coating of paint or varnish is sometimes applied 
to iron in order to prevent contact with air. The galvanizing 
of iron is another attempt to secure the same result ; in this 
process iron is dipped into molten zinc, thereby acquiring a 
coating of zinc, and forming what is known as galvanized 
iron. Zinc does not combine with oxygen under ordinary cir- 
cumstances, and hence galvanized iron is immune from rust. 
Decay isa process of oxidation ; the tree which rots slowly 
away is undergoing oxidation, and the result of the slow 
burning is the decomposed matter which we see and the 
invisible gases which pass into the atmosphere. The log 
which blazes on our hearth gives out sufficient heat to warm 
us ; the log which decays in the forest gives out:an equivalent 
amount of heat, but the heat is evolved so slowly that we are 
not conscious of it. Burning accompanied by a blaze and 
intense heat is a rapid process; burning unaccompanied by 
fire and appreciable heat isa slow, gradual process, requiring 
days, weeks, and even long years for its completion. 
Another form of oxidation occurs daily in the human body. 
In Section 35 we saw that the human body is an engine 
whose fuel is food; the burning of that food in the body 
furnishes the heat necessary for bodily warmth and the 
energy required for thought and action. Oxygen is essential 
to burning, and the food fires within the body are kept alive 
by the oxygen taken into the body at every breath by the 
lungs. We see now one reason for an abundance of fresh 
air in daily life. 
CL. GEN. SCI.—4
-P-A-G-E-50
50 BURNING OR OXIDATION 
40. How to Breathe. Air, which is essential to life and 
health, should enter the body through the nose and xot 
through the mouth. The peculiar nature and arrangement 
of the membranes of the nose enable the nostrils to clean, 
and warm, and moisten the air which passes through them 
to the lungs. . Floating around in the atmosphere are dust 
particles which ought not to get into the lungs. The nose 
is provided with small hairs and a moist inner membrane 
- which serve as filters in removing solid particles from the 
air, and in thus purifying it before its entrance into the 
lungs. 
In the immediate neighborhood of three Philadelphia high 
schools, having an approximate enrollment of over 8000 
pupils, is a huge manufacturing plant which day and night 
pours forth grimy smoke and soot into the atmosphere which 
must supply oxygen to this vast group of young lives. If the ~ 
vital importance of nose breathing is impressed upon these 
young people, the harmful effect of the foul air may be greatly 
lessened, the smoke particles and germs being held back by 
the nose filters and never reaching the lungs. If, however, 
this principle of hygiene is not brought to their attention, 
the dangerous habit of breathing through the open, or at least 
partially open, mouth will continue, and objectionable matter 
will pass through the mouth and find a lodging place in the 
lungs. 
There is another very important reason why nose breath- 
ing is preferable to mouth breathing. The temperature of 
the human body is approximately 98° F., and the air which 
enters the lungs should not be far below this temperature. 
If air reaches the lungs through the nose, its journey is rela- 
tively long and slow, and there is opportunity for it to be 
warmed before it reaches the lungs. If, on the other hand, 
_air passes to the lungs by way of the mouth, the warming 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  HOW TO BUILD A FIRE Bi 
process is brief and insufficient, and the lungs suffer in con- 
sequence. Naturally, the gravest danger is in winter. 
41. Cause of Mouth Breathing. Some people find it diffi- 
cult to breathe through the nostrils on account of growths, 
called adenoids, in the nose. If you have a tendency toward 
mouth breathing, let a physician examine your nose and 
throat. 
Adenoids not only obstruct breathing and weaken the 
whole system through lack of adequate air, but they also 
press upon the blood ves- 
sels and nerves of the 
head and interfere with 
normal brain development. 
Moreover, they interfere in 
many cases with the hear- 
ing, and in general hinder 
activity and growth. The 
removal of adenoids is 
simple, and carries with it 
only temporary pain and 
no danger. Some physi- 
cians claim that the 
growths disappear in later 
years, but even if that is 
true, the physical and mental development of earlier years 
is lost, and the person is backward in the struggle for life 
and achievement. 
42. How to Build a Fire. Substances differ greatly as to 
the ease with which they may be made to burn or, in tech- 
nical terms, with which they may be made to unite with 
oxygen. For this reason, we put light materials, like shav- 
ings, chips, and paper, on the grate, twisting the latter and 
arranging it so that air (oxygen in the air) can reach a large 
  FIG. 23. — Intelligent expression is often lack- 
ing in children with adenoid growths. ‘
-P-A-G-E-52
    52 BURNING OR OXIDATION 
surface; upon this we place small sticks of wood, piling them 
across each other so as to allow entrance for the oxygen; and 
finally upon this we place our hard wood or coal. 
The coal and the large sticks cannot be kindled with a 
match, but the paper and shavings can, and these in burning 
will heat the large sticks until they take fire and in turn 
kindle the coal. 
43. Spontaneous Combustion. We often hear of fires 
“starting themselves,” and sometimes the statement is true. 
If a pile of oily rags is allowed to stand for a time, the oily 
matter will begin to combine slowly with oxygen and as a 
result will give off heat. The heat thus given off is at first 
insufficient to kindle a fire; but as the heat is retained and 
accumulated, the temperature rises, and finally the kindling 
point is reached and the whole mass bursts into flames. For 
safety’s sake, all oily cloths should be burned or kept in 
metal vessels. 
44. The Treatment of Burns. In spite of great caution, 
burns from fires, steam, or hot water do sometimes occur, and 
it is well to know how to relieve the suffering caused by them 
and how to treat the injury in order to insure rapid healing. 
’ Burns are dangerous because they destroy skin and thus open 
up an entrance into the body for disease germs, and in addi- 
tion because they lay bare nerve tissue which thereby be- 
comes irritated and causes a shock to the entire system. 
In mild burns, where the skin is not broken but is merely 
reddened, an application of moist baking soda brings imme- 
diate relief. If this substance is not available, flour paste, 
lard, sweet oil, or vaseline may be used. 
In more severe burns, where blisters are formed, the blisters 
should be punctured with a sharp, sterilized needle and allowed 
to discharge their watery contents before the above remedies 
are applied.
-P-A-G-E-53
  DANGER OF CARBON DIOXIDE 53 
In burns severe enough to destroy the skin, disinfection of 
the open wound with weak carbolic acid or hydrogen peroxide 
is very necessary. After this has been done, a soft cloth 
soaked in a solution of linseed oil and limewater should be 
applied and the whole bandaged. In such a case, it is im- 
portant not to use cotton batting, since this sticks to the rough 
surface and causes pain when removed. 
45. Carbon Dioxide. A Product of Burning. When any 
fuel, such as coal, gas, oil, or wood, burns, it sends forth gases 
into the surrounding atmosphere. These gases, like air, are 
invisible, and were unknown to us for along time. The chief 
gas formed by a burning substance is called carbon dioxide 
(CO,) because it is composed of one part of carbon and two 
parts of oxygen. This gas has the distinction of being the 
most widely distributed gaseous compound of the entire world ; 
it is found in the ocean depths and on the mountain heights, 
in brilliantly lighted rooms, and most abundantly in manu- 
facturing towns where factory chimneys constantly pour forth 
hot gases and smoke. 
Wood and coal, and in fact all animal and vegetable mat- 
ter, contain carbon, and when these substances burn or de- 
cay, the carbon in them unites with oxygen and forms carbon 
dioxide. 
The food which we eat is either animal or vegetable, and 
it is made ready for bodily use by a slow process of burning 
within the body; carbon dioxide accompanies this bodily 
burning of food just as it accompanies the fires with which 
we are more familiar. The carbon dioxide thus produced 
within the body escapes into the atmosphere with the breath. 
We see that the source of carbon dioxide is practically in- 
exhaustible, coming as it does from every stove, furnace, and 
candle, and further with every breath of a living organism. 
46. Danger of Carbon Dioxide. When carbon dioxide oc-
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 BURNING OR OXIDATION 
curs in large quantities, it is dangerous to health, because it 
interferes with normal breathing, lessening the escape of 
waste matter through the breath and preventing the access 
to the lungs of the oxygen necessary for life. Carbon diox- 
ide is not poisonous, but it cuts off the supply of oxygen, i 
as water cuts it off from a drowning man. 
Since every man, woman, and child constantly predine 
forth carbon dioxide, the danger in overcrowded rooms is 
_great, and proper ventilation is of vital importance. 
* 47. Ventilation. In estimating the quantity of air necessary 
“ to keep a room well aired, we must take into account the num- 
ber of lights (electric lights do not count) to be used, and the 
number of people to occupy the room. The average house 
should provide at the mzxzmum 600 cubic feet of space for 
each person, and in addition, arrangements for allowing at 
least 300 cubic feet of fresh air per person to enter every hour. 
In houses which have not a ventilating system, the air 
should be kept fresh by intelligent action in the opening of 
doors and windows; and since relatively few houses are 
equipped with a satisfactory system, the following sugges- 
tions relative to intelligent ventilation are offered. 
1. Avoid drafts in ventilation. 
2. Ventilate on the sheltered side of the house. If the 
wind is blowing from the north, open south windows. 
48. What Becomes of the Carbon Dioxide. When we re- 
flect that carbon dioxide is constantly being supplied to the 
atmosphere and that it is injurious to health, the question 
naturally arises as to how the air remains free enough of the 
gas to support life. This is largely because carbon dioxide 
is an essential food of plants. Through their leaves plants 
absorb it from the atmosphere, and by a wonderful process 
break it up into its component parts, oxygen and carbon. 
They reject the oxygen, which passes back to the air, but they
-P-A-G-E-55
A COMMERCIAL USE OF CARBON DIOXIDE 55 
retain the carbon, which becomes a part of the plant structure. 
Plants thus serve to keep the atmosphere free from an ex- 
cess of carbon dioxide and, in addition, furnish oxygen to 
the atmosphere. 
49. How to Obtain Carbon Dioxide. There are several 
ways in which carbon dioxide can be produced commer- 
cially, but for laboratory use the simplest is to mix in a 
test tube powdered marble, or chalk, and hydrochloric acid, 
and to collect the effervescing gas as shown in Figure 24. 
The substance which re- 
mains in the test tube 
after the gas has passed 
off is a solution of a salt 
and water. From a mix- 
ture of hydrochloric acid 
(HCl) and marble are ob- 
tained a salt, water, and 
carbon dioxide, the de- 
sired gas. 
50. A Commercial Use Fic. 24.—Making carbon dioxide from marble 
of Carbon Dioxide. If a and Byte neds age 
lighted splinter is thrust into a test tube containing carbon di- 
oxide, it is promptly extinguished, because carbon dioxide 
cannot support combustion; if a stream of carbon dioxide 
and water falls upon a fire, it acts like a blanket, covering 
the flames and extinguishing them. The value of a fire 
extinguisher depends upon the amount of carbon dioxide and 
water which it can furnish. <A fire extinguisher is a metal 
case containing a solution of bicarbonate of soda, and a glass 
vessel full of strong sulphuric acid. As long as the extin- 
guisher is in an upright position, these substances are kept 
separate, but when the extinguisher is inverted, the acid escapes 
from the bottle, and mixes with the soda solution. The min- 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 BURNING OR OXIDATION 
gling liquids interact and liberate carbon dioxide. A part of 
the gas thus liberated dissolves in the 
water of the soda solution and escapes 
from the tube with the outflowing 
liquid, while a portion remains undis- 
solved and escapes as a stream of gas. 
The fire extinguisher is therefore the 
source of a liquid containing the fire- 
extinguishing substance and further 
the source of a stream of carbon diox- 
ide gas. 
51. Carbon. Although carbon di- 
oxide is very injurious to health, both 
of the substances of which it is com- 
posed are necessary to life. We our- 
selves, our bones and flesh in partic- 
ular, are partly carbon, and every 
animal, no matter how small or insig- 
nificant, contains some carbon; while 
the plants around us, the trees, the 
: grass, the flowers, contain a by no FIG. 25.— Inside view of a “ Ree ectiu wishin! means meager quantity of carbon. 
Carbon plays an important and va- 
ried réle in our life, and, in some one of its many forms, 
enters into the composition of most of the substances which 
are of service and value to man. The food we eat, the 
clothes we wear, the wood and coal we burn, the marble we 
employ in building, the indispensable soap, and the orna- 
mental diamond, all contain carbon in some form. 
52. Charcoal. One of the most valuable forms of carbon 
is charcoal; valuable not in the sense that it costs hundreds 
of dollars, but in the more vital sense, that its use adds to 
the cleanliness, comfort, and health of man.   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-57
HOW CHARCOAL IS MADE 57 
The foul, bad-smelling gases which arise from sewers can 
be prevented from escaping and passing to streets and build- 
ings by placing charcoal filters at the sewer exits. Charcoal 
is porous and absorbs foul gases, and thus keeps the region 
surrounding sewers sweet and clean and free of odor. Good 
housekeepers drop small bits of charcoal into vases of flowers 
to prevent discoloration of the water and the odor of decaying 
stems. 
If impure water filters through charcoal, it emerges pure, 
having left its impurities in the pores of the charcoal. Prac- 
tically all household filters of drinking water are made of 
charcoal. But such a device may be a source of disease in- 
stead of a prevention of disease, unless the filter is regularly 
cleaned or renewed. This is because the pores soon become 
clogged with the impurities, and unless they are cleaned, the 
water which flows through the filter passes through a bed of 
impurities and becomes contaminated rather than purified. 
Frequent cleansing or renewal of the filter removes this diffi- 
culty. 
Commercially, charcoal is used on a large scale in the refin- 
ing of sugars, sirups, and oils. Sugar, whether it comes 
from the maple tree, or the sugar cane, or the beet, is dark 
colored. It is whitened by passage through filters of finely 
pulverized charcoal. Cider and vinegar are likewise cleared 
by passage through charcoal. 
The value of carbon, in the form of charcoal, as a purifier 
is very great, whether we consider it a deodorizer, as in the 
case of the sewage, or a decolorizer, as in the case of the re- 
fineries, or whether we consider the service it has. rendered

53. How Charcoal is Made. Charcoal may be made by 
heating wood in an oven to which air does not have free 
access. The absence of air prevents ordinary combustion,
-P-A-G-E-58
    58 BURNING OR OXIDATION 
nevertheless the intense heat affects the wood and changes 
it into new substances, one of which is charcoal. . 
The wood which smolders on the hearth and in the stove 
is charcoal in the making. Formerly wood was piled in 
heaps, covered with sod or sand to prevent access of oxygen, 
and then was set fire to; the smoldering wood, cut off from an 
adequate supply of air, was slowly transformed into charcoal. 
Scattered over the country one still finds isolated charcoal 
kilns, crude earthen receptacles, in which wood thus deprived 
of air was allowed to smolder and form charcoal. To-day 
charcoal is made commercially by piling wood on steel cars 
and then pushing the cars into strong walled chambers. The 
chambers are closed to prevent access of air, and heated to a 
high temperature. The intense heat transforms the wood 
into charcoal in a few hours. A student can make in the 
laboratory sufficient charcoal for art lessons by heating in an 
earthen vessel wood buried in sand. The process will be 
slow, however, because the heat furnished by a Bunsen burner 
is not great, and the wood is transformed slowly. 
A form of charcoal known as animal charcoal, or bone 
black, is obtained from the charred remains of animals rather 
than plants, and may be prepared by burning bones and 
animal refuse as in the case of the wood. 
Destructive Distillation. When wood is burned without 
sufficient air, it is changed into soft brittle charcoal, which is 
very different from wood. It weighs only one fourth as much 
as the original wood. It is evident that much matter must 
leave the wood during the process of charcoal making. We 
can prove this by putting some dry shavings in a strong test 
tube fitted with a delivery tube. When the wood is heated a 
gas passes off which we may collect and burn. Other sub- 
stances also come off in gaseous form, but they condense in 
the water.. Among these are wood alcohol, wood tar, and acetic
-P-A-G-E-59
MATTER AND ENERGY 59 
acid. In the older method of charcoal making all these prod- 
ucts were lost. Can you give any uses of these substances? 
54. Matter and Energy. When wood is burned, a small 
pile of ashes is left, and we think of the bulk of the wood as 
destroyed. It is true we have less matter that is available for 
use or that is visible to sight, but, nevertheless, no matter has 
been destroyed. The matter of which the wood is composed 
has merely changed its character, some of it is in the condition 
of ashes, and some in the condition of invisible gases, such as 
carbon dioxide, but none of it has been destroyed. It is a 
principle of science that matter can neither be destroyed nor 
created; it can only be changed, or transformed, and it is our 
business to see that we do not heedlessly transform it into 
substances which are valueless to us and our descendants ; 
as, for example, when our magnificent forests are recklessly 
wasted. The smoke, gases, and ashes left in the path of a 
raging forest fire are no compensation to us for the valuable 
timber destroyed. The sum total of matter has not been 
changed, but the amount of matter which man can use has 
been greatly lessened. 
The principle just stated embodies one of the fundamental 
laws of science, called the law of the conservation of matter. 
A similar law holds for energy as well. We can transform 
electric energy into the motion of trolley cars, or we can make’ 
use of the energy of streams to turn the wheels of our mills, 
but in all these cases we are transforming, not creating, energy. , 
When a ball is fired from a rifle, most of the energy of the 
gunpowder is utilized in motion, but some is dissipated in pro- 
ducing a flash and a report, and in heat. The energy of the 
gunpowder has been scattered, but the sum of the various 
forms of energy is equal to the energy originally stored away 
in the powder. The better the gun is, the less will be the 
energy dissipated in smoke and heat and noise.

  CHAPTER V 
FOOD 
55. The Body as a Machine. Wholesome food and fresh 
air are necessary for a healthy body. Many housewives, 
through ignorance, supply to their hard-working husbands 
and their growing sons and daughters food which satisfies 
the appetite, but which does not give to the body the elements 
needed for daily work and growth. Some foods, such as 
lettuce, cucumbers, and watermelons, make proper and satis- 
factory changes in diet, but are not strength giving. Other 
foods, like peas and beans, not only satisfy the appetite, 
but supply to the body abundant nourishment. Many im- 
migrants live cheaply and well with beans and bread as 
their main diet. 
It is of vital importance that the relative value of different 
foods as heat producers be known definitely ; and just as the 
yard measures length and the pound measures weight the 
calorie is used to measure the amount of heat which a food is 
capable of furnishing to the body. Our bodies are human 
machines, and, like all other machines, require fuel for their 
maintenance. The fuel supplied to an engine is not all avail- 
able for pulling the cars; a large portion of the fuel is lost in 
smoke, and another portion is wasted as ashes. So it is with 
the fuel that runs the body. The food we eat is not all avail- 
able for nourishment, much of it being as useless to us as are 
smoke and ashes to an engine. The best foods are those 
which do the most for us with the least possible waste. 
56. Fuel Value. By fuel value is meant the capacity foods 
have for yielding heat to the body. The fuel value of 
the foods we eat daily is so important a factor in life that 
60
-P-A-G-E-61
  FUEL VALUE 61 
physicians, dietitians, nurses, and those having the care of 
institutional cooking acquaint themselves with the relative 
fuel values of practically all of the important food substances. 
The life or death of a patient may be determined by the 
patient’s diet, and the working and earning capacity of a 
father depends largely upon his prosaic three meals. An 
ounce of fat, whether it is the fat of meat or the fat of olive 
oil or the fat of any other food, produces in the body two and 
a quarter times as much heat as an ounce of starch. Of the 
vegetables, beans provide the greatest nourishment at the 
least cost, and to a large extent may be substituted 
for meat. It is not uncommon to find an outdoor 
laborer consuming one pound of beans per day, 
and taking meat only on “high days and holidays.” 
The fuel value of a food is determined by means 
of the domé calorimeter (Fig. 26). The food sub- 
stance is put into a cham- 
ber A and ignited, and the 
heat of the burning sub- 
stance raises the temper- 
ature of the water in the sur- 
rounding vessel. If 1000 
grams of water are in the 
vessel, and the temperature 
of the water is raised 2°C., 
the number of calories pro- 
duced by the substance Fic. 26,—The bomb calorimeter from which would be 2000, and the fuel the fuel value of food can be estimated. 
value would be 2000 calories.* From this the fuel value 
of one quart or one pound of the substance can be deter- 
  * As applied to food, the calorie, is greater than that used in the ordinary 
laboratory work, being the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 
1000 grams of water 1°C., rather than 1 gram 1°C,

mined, and the food substance will be said to furnish the 
body with that number of heat units, providing all of the 
pound of food were properly digested.

57. Varied Diet. The human body is a much more varied 
and complex machine than any ever devised by man; per- 
sonal peculiarities, as well as fuel values, influence very 
largely the diet of an individual. Strawberries are excluded 
from some diets because of a rash which is produced on the 
skin, pork is excluded from other diets for a like reason; 
cauliflower is absolutely indigestible to some and is readily 
digested by others. From practically every diet some foods 
must be excluded, no matter what the fuel value of the 
substance may be. 
Then, too, there are more uses for food than the production 
of heat. Teeth and bones and nails need a constant supply
-P-A-G-E-63
  WHY WE EAT SO MUCH 63 
of mineral matter, and mineral matter is frequently found in 
greatest abundance in foods of low fuel value, such as lettuce, 
watercress, etc., though practically all foods yield at least a 
small mineral constituent. When fuel values alone are con- 
sidered, fruits have a low value, but because of the flavor they 
impart to other foods, and because of the healthful influence 
they exercise in digestion, they cannot be excluded from the 
diet. 
Care should be constantly exercised to provide substantial 
foods of high fuel value. But the nutritive foods should be 
wisely supplemented by such foods as fruits, whose real value 
is one of indirect rather then direct service. 
58. Our Bodies. Somewhat as a house is composed of a 
group of bricks, or a sand heap of grains of sand, the human 
body is composed of small divisions called cells. Ordinarily 
we cannot see these cells because of their minuteness, but if 
we examine a piece of skin, or a hair of the. head, or a tiny 
sliver of bone under the microscope, we see that each of these 
is composed of a group of different cells. A merchant, watch- 
ful about the fineness of the wool which he is purchasing, 
counts with his lens the number of threads to the inch; a 
physician, when he wishes, can, with the aid of the micro- 
scope, examine the cells in a muscle, or in a piece of fat, or in 
a nerve fiber. Not only is the human body composed of 
cells, but so also are the bodies of all animals from the tiny | 
gnat which annoys us, and the fly which buzzes around us, 
to the mammoth creatures of the tropics. These cells do the 
work of the body, the bone cells build up the skeleton, the 
nail cells form the finger and toe nails, the lung cells take 
care of breathing, the muscle cells control motion, and the 
brain cells are responsible for thought. 
59. Why we eat so Much. The cells of the body are 
constantly, day by day, minute by minute, breaking down
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 FOOD 
and needing repair, are constantly requiring replacement by 
new cells, and, in the case of the child, are continually in- 
creasing in number. The repair of an ordinary machine, 
an engine, for example, is made at the expense of money, 
but the repairand replacement of our human cell machinery 
are accomplished at the expense of food. More than one 
third of all the food we eat goes to maintain the body cells, 
and to keep them in good order. It is for this reason that 
we consume a large quantity of food. If all the food we eat 
were utilized for energy, the housewife could cook less, and 
the housefather could save money on grocer’s and butcher’s 
bills. If you put a ton of coal in anengine, its available 
energy is used to run the engine, but if the engine were like 
the human body, one third of the ton would be used up by 
the engine in keeping walls, shafts, wheels, belts, etc., in 
order, and only two thirds would go towards running the 
engine. Whenean engine is not working, fuel is not con- 
sumed, but the body requires food for mere existence, regard- 
less of whether it does active work or not. When,we work, ° 
the cells break down more quickly, and the repair is greater 
than when we are at rest, and hence there is need of a larger 
amount of food ; but whether we work or not, food is necessary. 
60. The Different Foods. The body is very exacting in its 
demands, requiring certain definite foods for the formation 
and maintenance of its cells, and other foods, equally definite, 
but of different character, for heat; our diet therefore must 
contain foods of high fuel value, and likewise foods of cell- 
forming power. 
Although the foods which we eat are of widely different 
character, such as fruits, vegetables, cereals, oils, meats, eggs, 
milk, cheese, etc., they can be put into three great classes: 
the carbohydrates, the fats, and the proteids. 
61. The Carbohydrates. Corn, wheat, rye, in fact all
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE FATS 65 
cereals and grains, potatoes, and most vegetables are rich in 
carbohydrates ; as are also sugar, molasses, honey, and maple 
sirup. The foods of the first group are valuable because of 
the starch they contain; for example, corn starch, wheat 
starch, potato starch. The substances of the second group 
are valuable because of the sugar they contain ; sugar contains 
the maximum amount of carbohydrate. In the sirups there 
is a considerable quantity of sugar, while in some fruits it is 
present in more or less dilute form. Sweet peaches, apples, 
grapes, contain a moderate amount of sugar; watermelons, 
pears, etc., contain less. Most of our carbohydrates are of plant 
origin, being found in vegetables, fruits, cereals, and sirups. 
Carbohydrates, whether of the starch group or the sugar 
group, are composed chiefly of three elements: carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen; they are therefore combustible, and 
are great energy producers. On the other hand, they are 
worthless for cell growth and repair, and if we limited our 
diet to carbohydrates, we should be like a man who had fuel 
but no engine capable of using it. 
62. The Fats. The best-known fats are butter, lard, olive 
oil, and the fats of meats, cheese, and chocolate. When we 
test fats for fuel values by means of a calorimeter (Fig. 26), we 
find that they yield twice as much heat as the carbohydrates, 
but that they burn out more quickly. Dwellers in cold climates 
must constantly eat large quantities of fatty foods if they are 
to keep their bodies warm and survive the extreme cold. 
Cod liver oil is an excellent food medicine, and if taken in 
winter serves to warm the body and to protect it against the 
rigors of cold weather. The average person avoids fatty 
foods in summer, knowing from experience that rich foods 
make him warm and uncomfortable. The harder we work and 
the colder the weather, the more food of that kind do we re- 
quire ; itis said that a lumberman doing heavy out-of-door work 
CL, GEN. SCI.— 5 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 FOOD 
in cold climates needs three times as much food as a city clerk. 
Most of our fats, like lard and butter, are of animal. origin; 
some of them, however, like 
olive oil, peanut butter, and 
coconut oil, are of plant origin. 
63. The Proteids. The pro- 
teids are the building foods, 
Fic. 27.—a is the amount of fat neces- furnishing muscle, bone, skin 
sary to make one calorie; 4 is the cells, etc., and supplying blood 
amount of sugar or proteld newessaty an ‘ther bodily fluids. The best-known proteids are white 
of egg, curd of milk, and lean of fish and meat; peas and 
beans have an abundant supply of this substance, and nuts 
are rich init. Most of our proteids are of animal origin, but 
some protein material is also found in the vegetable world. 
This class of foods contains carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, 
~ and in addition, two substances not found in carbohydrates or 
fats — namely, sulphur and nitrogen. Proteids always con- 
tain nitrogen, and hence they are frequently spoken of as 
nitrogenous foods. Since the proteids contain all the ele- 
ments found in the two other classes of foods, they are able 
to contribute, if necessary, to the store of bodily energy ; but 
their main function is upbuilding, and the diet should be 
chosen so that the proteids do not have a double task. 
For an average man four ounces of dry proteid matter 
daily will suffice to keep the body cells in normal condition. 
It has been estimated that 300,000,000 blood cells alone 
need daily repair or renewal. When we consider that the 
blood is but one part of the body, and that all organs and 
fluids have corresponding requirements, we realize how vast 
is the work to be done by the food which we eat. 
64. Mistakes in Buying. The body demands a daily ration 
of the three classes of food stuffs, but it is for us to determine 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  MISTAKES IN BUYING : 67 
from what meats, vegetables, fruits, cereals, etc., this supply 
shall be obtained (Figs. 28 and 29). 
Generally speaking, meats are the most expensive foods we 
‘can purchase, and hence should be bought seldom and in 
small quantities. Their place can be taken by beans, peas, 
potatoes, etc., and at less than a quarter of the cost. The 
average American family eats meat three times a day, while 
the average family of the more conservative and older

“The tables show that one family spends over twice as 
much in the purchase of foods as the other family, and yet 
the one whose food costs the less actually secures the larger 
amount of nutritive material and is better fed than the family 
where more money is expended.” — From Human Foods, 
Snyder. 
The Source of the Different Foods. All of our food comes 
from either the plant world or the animal world. Broadly 
speaking, plants furnish the carbohydrates, that is, starch 
and sugar; animals furnish the fats and proteids. But al- 
though vegetable foods yield carbohydrates mainly, some 
of them, like beans and peas, contain large quantities of 
protein and can be substituted for meat without disadvan- 
tage to the body. Other plant products, such as nuts, have 
fat as their most-abundant food constituent. The peanut, for 
example, contains 43% of fat, 30% of proteids, and only 
17% of carbohydrates; the Brazil nut has 65% of fat, 17% 
of proteids, and only 9% of carbohydrates. Nuts make a 
good meat substitute, and since they contain a fair amount of 
carbohydrates besides the fats and proteins, they supply all of 
the essential food constituents and form a well-balanced food.

  CHAPTER VI 
WATER 
65. Destructive Action of Water. The action of water in 
stream and sea, in springs and wells, is evident to all; but 
the activity of ground water—that is, rain water which sinks 
into the soil and remains there-—is little known in general. 
The real activity of ground water is due to its great solvent 
power ; every time we put sugar into tea or soap into water we 
are using water as a solvent. When rain falls, it dissolves sub- 
stances floating in the atmosphere, and when it sinks into the 
ground and becomes ground water, it dissolves material out 
of the rock which it encounters (Fig. 30). We know that water 
contains some mineral matter, because kettles in which water 
is boiled acquire in a short time a crust or coating on the in- 
side. This crust is due to the accumulation in the kettle of 
mineral matter which 
was in solution in the 
water, but which was 
left behind when the 
water evaporated. (See 
Section 25.) 
The amount of dis- 
solved mineral matter 
present in some wells 
and springs is surprisingly great; the famous springs of Bath, 
England, contain so much mineral matter in solution, that a 
column 9 feet in diameter and 140 feet high could be built 
70 
    FIG. 30.— Showing how caves and holes are 
formed by the solvent action of water. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  DESTRUCTIVE ACTION OF WATER 71 
out of the mineral matter contained in the water consumed 
yearly by the townspeople. 
Rocks and minerals are not all equally soluble in water; 
some are so little soluble that it is years before any change 
becomes apparent, and the substances are said to be insolu- 
ble, yet in reality they are slowly dissolving. Other rocks, 
like limestone, are so readily soluble in water that from the 
small pores and cavities eaten out by the water, there may 
develop in long centuries, caves and caverns (Fig. 30). Most 
rock, like granite, con- 
tains several — sub- 
stances, some of which 
are readily soluble and 
others of which are not 
readily soluble; in such 
rocks a peculiar ap- 
pearance is presented, 
due to the rapid disap- 
pearance of the soluble 
substance, and the per- 
sistence of the more re- 
sistant substance (Fig. 
31). 
We see that the 
solvent power of water 
is constantly causing 
changes, dissolving 
some mineral substan- 
ces, and leaving others 
practically untouched ; 
eating out crevices of various shapes and sizes, and by gradual 
solution through unnumbered years enlarging these crevices 
into wonderful caves, such as the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.   
  FIG, 31.— The work of water as a solvent.  
-P-A-G-E-72
  72 WATER : ' 
66. Constructive Action of Water. Water does not always 
act as a destructive agent; what it breaks down in one place 
it builds up in another. It does this by means of precipita- 
tion. Water dissolves salt, and also dissolves lead nitrate, but 
if a salt solution is mixed with a lead nitrate solution, a solid 
white substance is formed in the water (Fig. 32). This for- 
mation of a solid substance 
from the mingling of two 
liquids is called precipita- 
tion ; sucha process occurs 
daily in the rocks beneath 
the surface of the earth. 
(See Laboratory Manual.) 
Suppose water from dif- 
ferent sources enters a 
crack in a rock, bringing 
different substances in so- 
lution ; then the mingling of the waters may cause precipita- 
tion, and the solid thus formed will be deposited in the crack 
and fill it up. Hence, while ground water tends to make rock 
porous and weak by dissolving out of it large quantities of 
mineral matter, it also tends under other conditions to make 
it more compact because it deposits in cracks, crevices, and 
pores the mineral matter precipitated from solution. 
These two forces are constantly at work; in some places the 
destructive action is more prominent, in other places the con- 
structive action; but always the result is to change the charac- 
ter of the original substance. When the mineral matter pre- 
cipitated from the solutions is deposited in cracks, vezus are 
formed (Fig. 33), which may consist of the ore of different 
metals, such as gold, silver, copper, lead, etc. Man is almost 
entirely dependent upon these veins for the supply of metal 
needed in the various industries, because in the original con-   
  FIG. 32. — From the mingling of two liquids a 
solid is sometimes formed.
-P-A-G-E-73
    
STREAMS 73 
dition of the rocks, the metallic substances are so scattered 
that they cannot be profitably extracted. 
Naturally, the veins themselves are not composed of one 
substance alone, because several different precipitates may 
be formed. But there is a 
decided grouping of valu- 
able metals, and these can 
then be readily separated 
by means of electricity. 
67. Streams. Streams 
usually carry mud and sand 
along with them; this is 
particularly well seen after 
a storm when rivers and 
brooks are muddy. The 
puddles which collect at 
the foot of a hill after a 
storm are muddy because 
of the particles of soil 
gathered by the water as 
it runs down the hill. The 
particles are not dissolved

call it technically. The river made muddy after a storm by 
suspended particles usually becomes clear and transparent 
after it has traveled onward for miles, because, as it travels, 
the particles drop to the bottom and are deposited there. 
Hence, materials suspended in the water are borne along 
and deposited at various places (Fig. 34). The amount of 
deposition by large rivers is so great that in some places 
channels fill up and must be dredged annually, and vessels are 
sometimes caught in the deposit and have to be towed away.

  68. Relation of Water to Human Life. Water is one of the 
most essential of food materials, and whether we drink much
-P-A-G-E-75
WATER AND ITS DANGERS 75 
or little water, we nevertheless get a great deal of it. The 
larger part of many of our foods is composed of water; more 
than half of the weight of the 
meat we eat is made up of 
water; and vegetables are often 
more than nine tenths. water. 
(See Laboratory Manual.) As- 
paragus and tomatoes have over 
go per cent of water, and most 
fruits are more than three fourths 
water; even bread, which con- 
tains as little water as any of our 
common foods, is about one third 
water (Fig. 36). 
Without water, solid food 
material, although present in the pig, 46, — Dingram of the composition 
body, would not be in a:condi- of aloaf of bread and of a potato: 1, 
tion suitable for bodily use. An eh ee see 
abundant supply of water enables the food to be dissolved or 
suspended in it, and in solution the food material is easily 
distributed to all parts of the body. 
Further, water assists in the removal of the daily bodily 
wastes, and thus rids the system of foul and poisonous 
substances. 
The human body itself consists largely of water ; indeed, 
about two thirds of our own weight is water. The constant 
replenishing of this large quantity is necessary to life, and a 
considerable amount of the necessary supply is furnished by 
foods, particularly the fruits and vegetables. 
But while the supply furnished by the daily food is 
considerable, it is by no means sufficient, and should be 
supplemented by good drinking water. 
69. Water and its Dangers. Our drinking water comes 
     
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 WATER 
from far and near, and as it moves from place to place, it 
carries with it in solution or suspension anything which it 
can find, whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral matter. 
The power of water to gather up matter is so great that 
the average drinking water contains 20 to 90.grains of solid 
matter per gallon; that is, if a gallon of ordinary drinking 
water is left to evaporate, a residue of 20 to 90 grains will be 
left. (See Laboratory Manual.) As water runs down a hill 
  FIG. 37. — As water flows over the land, it gathers filth and disease germs. 
slope (Fig. 37), it carries with it the filth gathered from acres 
of land; carries with it the refuse of stable, barn, and kitchen; 
and too often this impure surface water joins the streams which 
supply our cities. Lakes and rivers which furnish drinking 
water should be carefully protected from surface draining ; 
that is, from water which has flowed over the land and has

thus accumulated the waste of pasture and stable and, it may 
be, of dumping ground. 
It is not necessary that water should be absolutely free 
from all foreign substances in order to be safe for daily use 
in drinking; a limited amount of mineral matter is not 
injurious and may sometimes be really beneficial. It is the 
presence of animal and vegetable matter that causes real 
danger, and it is known that typhoid fever is due largely to 
such impurities present in the drinking water. 
70. Methods of Purification. Water is improved by any 
of the following methods: — 
(a) Boiling. The heat of boiling destroys animal and 
vegetable germs. Hence water that has been boiled a few 
minutes is safe to use. This is the most practical method of 
purification in the home, and is very efficient. The boiled 
water should be kept in clean, corked bottles; otherwise for- 
eign substances from the atmosphere reénter the water, and 
the advantage gained from boiling is lost. 
(6) Distillation. By this method pure water is obtained, 
but this method of purification cannot be used conveniently in 
the home (Section 25). 
(c) Filtration. In filtration, the water is forced through 
porcelain or other porous substances which allow the passage 
of water, but which hold back the minute foreign particles 
suspended in the water. (See Laboratory Manual.) The fil- 
ters used in ordinary dwellings are of stone, asbestos, or char- 
coal. They are often valueless, because they soon become 
choked and cannot be properly cleaned. 
The filtration plants owned and operated by large cities 
are usually safe; there is careful supervision of the filters, 
and frequent and effective cleanings are made. In many 
cities the filtration system is so good that private care of the 
water supply is unnecessary.
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 WATER 
71. The Source of Water. In the beginning, the earth 
was stored with water just as it was with metal, rock, 
etc. Some of the water gradually took the form of rivers, 
lakes, streams, and wells, as now, and it is this original supply 
of water which furnishes us all that we have to-day. We 
quarry to obtain stone and marble for building, and we 
fashion the earth’s treasures into forms of our own, but we 
cannot create these things. We bore into the ground and 
drill wells in order to obtain water from hidden sources; 
we utilize rapidly flowing streams to drive the wheels of 
commerce, but the total amount of water remains practically 
unchanged. 
The water which flows on the earth is constantly changing 
its form; the heat of the sun causes it to evaporate, or to 
become vapor, and to mingle with the atmosphere. In time, 
the vapor cools, condenses, and falls as snow or rain; the 
water which is thus returned to the earth feeds our rivers, 
lakes, springs, and 
wells, and these in 
turn supply water to 
man. When water 
falls upon a field, it 
soaks into the ground, 
or collects in puddles.

the most valuable because it remains on the earth longest 
and is the purest. 
Water which soaks into the ground moves slowly down-
-P-A-G-E-79
THE COMPOSITION OF WATER 79 
ward and after a longer or shorter journey, meets with a non- 
porous layer of rock through which it cannot pass, and which 
effectually hinders its downward passage. In such regions, 
there is an accumulation of water, and a well dug there would 
have an abundant supply of water. The non-porous layer is 
rarely level, and hence the water whose vertical path is ob- 
structed does not ‘back up” on the soil, but flows down hill 
parallel with the obstructing non-porous layer, and in some 
distant region makes an outlet for itself, forming a spring 
(Fig. 38). The streams originating in the springs flow through 
the land and eventually join larger streams or rivers; from 
the surface of streams and rivers evaporation occurs,; the 
water once more becomes vapor and passes into the atmos- 
phere, where it is condensed and again falls to the earth. 
Water which has filtered through many feet of earth is far 
purer and safer than that which fell directly into the rivers, or 
which ran off from the land and joined the surface streams 
without passing through the soil. 
72. The Composition of Water. Water was long thought 
to be a simple sub- 
stance, but toward the 
end of the eighteenth 
century it was found 
to consist of two quite 
different substances, 
oxygen (O) and hy- 
drogen (H.) 
Tf we send an elec- 
tric current through 
water (acidulated to 
make it a good con- 
ductor), as shown in Figure 39, we see bubbles of gas rising 
from the end of the wire by which the current enters the water, 
\   
  
    
  FIG. 39. — The decomposition of water. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
    80 WATER 
and other bubbles of gas rising from the end of the wire by 
which the current leaves the water. These gases have evi- 
dently come from the water and are the substances of which 
it is composed, because the water begins to disappear as the 
gases are formed. If we place over each end of the wire an 
inverted jar filled with water, the gases are easily collected. 
The first thing we notice is that there is always twice as much 
of one gas as of the other; that is, water is composed of two 
substances, one of which is always present in twice as large 
quantities as the other. 
73. The Composition of Water. On testing the gases into 
which water is broken up by an electric current, we find them 
to be quite different. One proves to. be oxygen, a substance 
with which we are already familiar. The other gas, hydro- 
gen, is new to us and is interesting as being the lightest 
known substance, being even “lighter than a feather.” 
An important fact about hydrogen is that in burning it 
gives as much heat as five times its weight of coal. Its flame 
is blue and almost invisible by daylight, but intensely hot. 
If fine platinum wire is placed in an ordinary gas flame, it 
does not melt, but if placed in a flame of burning hydrogen, it 
melts very quickly. 
74. How to prepare Hydrogen. There are many different 
methods of preparing hydrogen, but the easiest laboratory 
_ method is to pour sulphuric acid, or hydrochloric acid, on zinc 
shavings and to collect in a bottle the gas which is given off. 
This gas proves to be colorless, tasteless, and odorless. (See 
Laboratory Manual.)

75. The Instability of the Air. We are usually not con- 
scious of the air around us, but sometimes we realize that 
the air is heavy, while at other times we feel the bracing 
effect of the atmosphere. We live in an ocean of air as truly 
as fish inhabit an ocean of water. If you have ever been at 
the seashore you know that the ocean is never still for a sec- 
ond; sometimes the waves surge back and forth in angry 
fury, at other times the waves glide gently in to the shore 
and the surface is as smooth as glass ; but we know that there 
is perpetual motion of the water even when the ocean is in its © 
gentlest moods. Generally our atmosphere is quiet, and we 
are utterly unconscious of it; at other times we are painfully 
aware of it, because of its furious winds. Then again we are 
oppressed by it because of the vast quantity of vapor which it 
holds in the form of fog, or mist. The atmosphere around 
us is as restless and varying as is the water of the sea. The 
air at the top of a high tower is very different from the air at 
the base of the tower. Not only does the atmosphere vary 
greatly at different altitudes, but it varies at the same place 
from time to time, at one period being heavy and raw, at 
another being fresh and invigorating. 
Winds, temperature, and humidity all have a share in deter- 
mining atmospheric conditions, and no one of these plays a 
small part. 
76. The Character of the Air. The atmosphere which 
envelops us at all times extends more than fifty miles above 
us, its height being far greater than the greatest depths of the 
CL. GEN. SCI.—6 81

sea. This atmosphere varies from place to place; at the sea 
level it is heavy, on the mountain 
top less heavy, and far above the 
earth it is so light that it does not 
contain enough oxygen to permit man 
tolive. Figure 40 illustrates by a pile 
of pillows how the pressure of the air 
varies from level to level. 
Sea level is a low portion of the 
earth’s surface, hence at sea level there 
: is a high column of air, and a heavy Fic. 40.— To illustrate the de- , 
crease in pressure with height, air pressure. As one passes from sea 
level to mountain top a gradual but 
steady decrease in the height of the air column occurs, 
and hence a gradual but definite lessening of the air pressure. 
77. Air Pressure. If an empty tube (Fig. 41) is placed 
upright in water, the water will not rise in the tube, but if the 
tube is put in water and the. air is then 
drawn out of the tube by the mouth, the 
water will rise in the tube (Fig. 42). This 
is what happens when we take lemonade 
through a straw. When the air is with- 
drawn from the straw by the mouth, the 
pressure within the straw is reduced, and 
  pressure on the surface of the liquid in 
the glass. Even the ancient Greeks and 
Romans knew that water would rise in a Fic. 41.—The water. in 
tube when the pressure within the tube was [he [ube is at fe 
reduced, and hence they tried to obtain 
water from wells in this fashion, but the water could never 
be raised higher than 34 feet. Let us see why water could 
rise 34 feet and no more. If an empty pipe is placed in a 
   
-P-A-G-E-83
    
AIR PRESSURE 83 
cistern of water, the water in the pipe does not rise above the 
level of the water in the cistern. If, how- 
ever, the pressure in the tube is removed, 
the water in the tube will rise to a height 
of 34 feet approximately. If now the air 
pressure in the tube is restored, the water 
in the tube sinks again to the level of that 
in the cistern. The air pressing on the 
liquid in the cistern tends to push some 
liquid up the tube, but the air pressing on 
the water in the tube pushes downwards, 
and tends to keep the liquid from rising, 
and these two pressures balance each other. rae Wate eae 
When, however, the pressure within the _ the tube when the air 
tube is reduced, the liquid rises because of eee 
the unbalanced pressure which acts on the water in the cistern. 
The column of water which can be raised this way is ap- 
proximately 34 feet, sometimes a trifle more, sometimes a 
trifle less. If water were twice as 
heavy, just half as high a column 
could be supported by the atmos- 
phere. y Mercury is about thirteen 
times as heavy as water and, there- 
fore, the column of mercury sup- 
ported by the atmosphere is about 
one thirteenth as high as the column 
of water supported by the atmosphere. 
This can easily be demonstrated. 
Fic, 43.—The air supports a Fill a glass tube about a yard long 
ae of mereury 30 Inches. with mercury, close the open end with 
a finger, and quickly insert the end of 
the inverted tube in a dish of mercury (Fig. 43). When the fin- 
geris removed, the mercury falls somewhat, leaving an empty

    84 AIR 
space in the top of the tube. If we measure the column in 
the tube, we find its height is about one thirteenth of 34 feet 
or 30 inches, exactly what we should expect. Since there is 
no air pressure within the tube, the atmospheric pressure on 
the mercury in the dish is balanced solely by the mercury 
within the tube, that is, by a column of mercury 30 inches high. 
The shortness of the mercury column as compared with that 
of water makes the mercury more convenient for both experi- 
mental and practical purposes. (See Laboratory Manual.) 
78. The Barometer. Since the pressure of the air changes 
from time to time, the height of the mercury will change from , 
day to day, and hour to hour. When the air pressure is heavy, 
the mercury will tend to be high; when the air pressure is low, 
the mercury will show a shorter column; and by reading the 
level of the mercury one can learn the pressure of the atmos- 
phere. If a glass tube and dish of mercury are at- 
tached to a board and the dish of mercury is inclosed 
in a case for protection from moisture and dirt, and 
further if a scale of inches or centimeters is made 
on the upper portion of the board, we have a mercu- 
rial barometer (Fig. 44). 
If the barometer is taken to the mountain top, 
the column of mercury falls gradually during the 
ascent, showing that as one ascends, the pressure 
decreases in agreement with the statement in Section 
76. Observations similar to these were made by 
Torricelli as early as the sixteenth century. Taking 
a barometric reading consists in measuring the 
Fic.44.—A height of the mercury column. 
eee 79. A Portable Barometer. The mercury ba- 
*rometer is large and inconvenient to carry from 
place to place, and'a more portable form has been devised, 
known as the aneroid barometer (Fig. 45). This form of   
  
        
  
 
-P-A-G-E-85
' A PORTABLE BAROMETER 85 
barometer is extremely sensitive ; indeed, it is so delicate that 
it shows the slight difference between the pressure at the table 
top and the pressure at the floor level, 
whereas the mercury barometer would 
indicate only a much greater variation 
in atmospheric pressure. The aneroid 
barometers are frequently made no / 
larger than a watch and can be carried [ 
conveniently in the pocket, but they | 
get out of order easily and must be fre- | 
quently readjusted. The aneroid ba- 
rometer is an air-tight box whose top 
is made of a thin metallic disk which 
bends inward or outward according 
to the pressure of the atmosphere. If the atmospheric pressure 
increases, the thin disk is pushed slightly inward; if, on the 
other hand, the atmospheric pressure decreases, the pressure on 
the metallic disk decreases and the disk is not pressed so far - 
inward. The motion of the disk is small, and it would be impos- 
sible to calculate changes in atmospheric 
pressure from the motion of the disk, 
without some mechanical device to make 
the slight changes in motion perceptible. 
In order to magnify the slight changes 
in the position of the disk, the thin face 
is connected with a system of levers, or — 
wheels, which multiplies the changes in 
motion and communicates them to a

80. The Weight of the Air. We have seen that the pres- 
sure of the atmosphere at any point is due to the weight of the 
air column which stretches from that point far up into the 
sky above. This weight varies slightly from time to time and 
from place to place, but it is equal to about 15 pounds to the 
square inch as-shown by actual measurement. It comes to 
us as a surprise sometimes that air actually has weight; for 
example, a mass of 12 cubic feet of air at average pressure 
weighs 1 pound, and the air in a large assembly hall weighs 
more than I ton. 
We are practically never conscious of this really enormous 
pressure of the atmosphere, which is exerted over every inch 
of our bodies, because the pressure is exerted equally over 
the outside and the inside of our bodies; the cells and tissues 
of our bodies containing gases under atmospheric pressure. 
If, however, the finger is placed over the open end of a tube 
and the air is sucked out of the tube by the mouth, the flesh 
of the finger bulges into the tube because the pressure within 
the finger is no longer equalized 
by the usual atmospheric pressure 
(Fig. 47). 
Aéronauts have never ascended 
much higher than 7 miles; at that 
height the barometer stands at 7 
inches instead of at 30 inches, and 
the internal pressure in cells and 
tissues is not balanced by an equal 
fea external pressure. The unequal- 
FIG. 47.—The flesh bulges out, ized internal pressure forces the 
blood to the surface of the body 
and causes rupture of blood vessels and other physical diffi- 
culties. 
81. Use of the Barometer. Changes in air pressure are 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  USE OF THE BAROMETER 87 
very closely connected with changes in the weather. The 
barometer does not directly foretell the weather, but a low or 
falling pressure, accompanied by a simultaneous fall of the 
mercury, usually precedes foul weather, while a rising pres- 
sure, accompanied by a simultaneous rise in the mercury, 
usually precedes fair weather. The barometer is not an in- 
  Fic. 48. — Barograph. 
fallible prophet, but it is of great assistance in predicting the 
general trend of the weather. There are certain changes in 
the barometer which follow no known laws, and which allow 
of no safe predictions, but on the other hand, general future 
conditions for a few days ahead can be fairly accurately deter- 
mined. Figure 48 shows a barograph or self-registering 
barometer which automatically registers air pressure. 
Seaport towns in particular, but all cities, large or small, 
and villages too, are on request notified by the United States 
Weather Bureau ten hours or more in advance, of probable 
weather conditions, and in this way precautions are taken 
which annually save millions of dollars and hundreds of lives.

I recollect a summer spent on a New Hampshire farm, and 
know that an old farmer started his farm hands haying by 
moonlight at two o’clock in the morning, because. the Special 
Farmer’s Weather Forecast of the preceding evening had 
predicted rain for the following day. His reliance on the 
weather report was not misplaced, since the storm came with 
full force at noon. Sailing vessels, yachts, and fishing dories 
remain within reach of port if the barometer foretells storms. 
82. Isobaric and Isothermal Lines. If a line were drawn 
through all points on the surface of the earth having an 
equal barometric pressure at the same time, such a line 
would be called an isobar. For example, if the height of 
barometers in different localities is observed at exactly the 
same time, and if all the cities and towns which have the

same pressure are connected by a line, the curved lines will 
be called isobars. By the aid of these lines the barometric 
conditions over a large area can be studied. The Weather 
Bureau at Washington relies greatly on these isobars for 
statements concerning local and distant weather forecasts, 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
    WEATHER MAPS 89 
any shift in isobaric lines showing change in atmospheric 
pressure. 
If a line is drawn through all points on the surface of the 
earth having the same zemperature at the same instant, such 
a line is called an isotherm (Fig. 49). 
83. Weather Maps. Scattered over the United States are 
about 125 Government Weather Stations, at each of which 
three times a day, at the same instant, accurate observations 
of the weather are made. These observations, which con- 
sist of the reading of barometer and thermometer, the deter- 
mination of the velocity and direction of the wind, the 
determination of the humidity and of the amount of rain or 
snow, are telegraphed to the chief weather official at Wash- 
ington. From the reports of wind storms, excessive rainfall, 
hot waves, clearing weather, etc., and their rate of travel, the 
chief officials predict where the storms, etc., will be at a defi- 
nite future time. In the United States, the general move- 
ment of weather conditions, as indicated by the barometer, is 
from west to east, and if a certain weather condition prevails 
in the west, it is probable that it will advance eastward, al- 
though with decided modifications. So many influences 
modify atmospheric conditions that unfailing predictions are 
impossible, but the Weather Bureau predictions prove true in 
about eight cases out of ten. 
The reports made out at Washington are telegraphed on 
request to cities in this country, and are frequently published 
in the daily papers, along with the forecast of the local office. 
A careful study of these reports enables one to forecast to 
some extent the probable weather conditions of the day, 
The first impression of a weather map (Fig. 50) with its 
various lines and signals is apt to be one of confusion, and the 
temptation comes to abandon the task of finding an underly- 
ing plan of the weather. If one will bear in mind a few sim-

ple rules, the complexity of the weather map will disappear 
and a glance at the map will give one information concern- 
ing general weather conditions just as a glance at the ther- 
| mometer in the morning will give some indication of the 
probable temperature of the day. (See Laboratory Manual.) 
On the weather map solid lines represent isobars and 
dotted lines represent isotherms. The direction of the wind 
at any point is indicated by an arrow which flies with the 
wind; and the state of the weather — clear, partly cloudy, 
cloudy, rain, snow, etc. —is indicated by syrhbols. . 
84. Components of the Air. The best known constituent of 
the air is oxygen, already familiar to us as the feeder of the 
fire without and within the body. Almost one fifth of the 
air which envelops us is made up of the life-giving oxygen. 
This supply of oxygen in the air is constantly being used up 
by breathing animals and glowing fires, and unless there were 
some constant source of additional supply, the quantity of 
oxygen in the air would soon become insufficient to support 
animal life. The unfailing constant source of atmospheric 
oxygen is plant life (Section 48). The leaves of plants absorb 
carbon dioxide from the air, and break it up into oxygen 
and carbon. The plant makes use of the carbon but it rejects 
the oxygen, which passes back into the atmosphere through 
the pores of the leaves. 
Although oxygen constitutes only one fifth of the atmos- 
phere, it is one of the most abundant and widely scattered of 
all substances. Almost the whole earth, whether it be rich 
loam, barren clay, or granite boulder, contains oxygen in 
some form or other; that is, in combination with other sub- 
stances. But nowhere, except in the air around us, do we 
find oxygen free and uncombined with other substances. 
A less familiar but more abundant constituent of the atmos- 
phere is the nitrogen. Almost four fifths of the air around -
-P-A-G-E-92
IU RTT TTT oN Crane OTR en eT RD eee Ne Mig nT NY an ee en ae 
92 AIR 
us is made up of nitrogen. If the atmosphere were composed 
of oxygen alone, the merest flicker of a match would set the 
whole world ablaze. The fact that the oxygen of the air is 
diluted as it were with so large a proportion of nitrogen, pre- 
vents fires from sweeping over the world and destroying 
everything in their path. Nitrogen does not support combus- 
tion, and a burning match placed in a corked bottle goes out 
as soon as it has used up the oxygen in the bottle. The 
nitrogen in the bottle, not only does not assist the burning of 
the match, but it acts as a damper to the burning. 
Free nitrogen, like oxygen, is a colorless, odorless gas. It 
is not poisonous; but one would die if surrounded by nitro- 
gen alone, just as one would die if surrounded by water. The 
vast supply of nitrogen in the atmosphere would be useless if 
the smaller amount of oxygen were not present to keep the 
body alive. Nitrogen is so important a factor in daily life 
that an entire chapter will be devoted to it later. 
Another constituent of the air with which we are familiar 
is carbon dioxide. In pure air, carbon dioxide is present in 
very small proportion, being continually taken from the air 
by plants in the manufacture of their food. 
Various other substances are present in the air in very 
minute proportions, but of all the substances in the air, oxy- 
gen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide are the most important.

GENERAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 
85. Bicycle Tires. We know very well that we cannot put 
more than a certain amount of water in a tube, but we know 
equally well that the amount of air which can be pumped 
into a bicycle or automobile tire depends largely upon our 
muscular energy. A gallon of water remains a gallon of 
water and requires a perfectly definite amount of space, but 
air can be compressed and compressed, and made to occupy 
less and less space. While it is true that air is easily com- 
pressed, it is also true that air is elastic and. capable of very 
rapid and easy expansion. If a puncture occurs in a tire, the 
compressed air escapes very 
quickly; that is, the com- 
pressed air within the tube 
has taken the first opportu- 
nity offered for expansion. 
The fact that air is elastic 
has added materially to the 
comfort of the world. Trans- 
portation by bicycles and au- 
tomobiles has been greatly ¥16- 5™— By squeezing uae ct 
facilitated by the use of air 
tires. In many hospitals, air mattresses are used in place of 
hair, feather, or cotton mattresses, and in this way the bed is 
kept fresher and cleaner, and can be moved with less danger of 
discomfort to the patient. Every time we squeeze the bulb 
of an atomizer, we force compressed or condensed air through 
93 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  94. GENERAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 
the atomizer, and the condensed air pushes the liquid out of 
the nozzle (Fig. 51). Thus we see that in the necessities 
and conveniences of life compressed air plays an important 
part. 
86. The Danger of Compression. Air under ordinary at- 
mospheric conditions exerts a pressure of 15 pounds to the 
square inch. If, now, large quantities of air are compressed 
into a small space, the pressure exerted becomes correspond- 
ingly greater. If too much air is blown into a toy balloon, 
the balloon bursts because it cannot support the great pres- 
sure exerted by the compressed air within. What is true of 
air is true of all gases. Dangerous boiler explosions have 
occurred because the boiler walls were not strong enough 
to withstand the pressure of the steam (which is water in the 
form of gas). The pressure within the 
boilers of engines is frequently several 
hundred pounds to the square inch, and 
such a pressure needs a strong boiler. 
« 87. How Pressure is Measured in 
Buildings. In the preceding Section 
we saw that undue pressure of a gas 
may cause explosion. It is important, 
therefore, that authorities keep strict 
watch on gases confined within pipes 
and reservoirs, never allowing the pres- 
sure to exceed that which the walls of 
the reservoir will safely bear. 
BG aysaie ts pressure Pressure in a gas pipe may be meas- 
Sone ured by a simple instrument called the 
pressure gauge: The gauge consists of a bent glass tube 
containing mercury, and so made that one end can be fitted 
to a gas jet (Fig. 52). When the gas cock is closed, the 
mercury stands at the same level in both arms, but when the 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE GAS METER 95 
cock is opened, the gas whose pressure is being measured 
forces the mercury up the opposite arm. If the pressure of 
the gas is small, the mercury changes its level but very little. 
It is clear that the height of a column of mercury is a meas- 
ure of the gas pressure. Now it is known that one cubic 
inch of mercury weighs about half a pound. Hence a column 
of mercury one inch high indicates a pressure of about. one 
half pound to the square inch; a column two inches high in- 
dicates a pressure of about one pound to the square inch, and 
so on. 
This is a very convenient way to measure the pressure of 
the illuminating gas in our homes and offices. The gauge is 
attached to the gas burner and the pressure is read by means 
of a scale attached to the gauge. (See Laboratory Manual.) 
In order to have satisfactory illumination, the pressure 
must be strong enough to give a steady, broad flame. If the 
flame from any gas jet is 
flickering and weak, it is 
usually an indication of 
insufficient pressure and 
the gas company should 
investigate conditions and 
see to it that the con- 
sumer receives his proper 
value. 100 THOUSAND 10 THOUSAND 1 THOUSAND

deeply interested in the actual amount of gas which they con- 
sume (gas is charged for according to the number of cubic 
feet used), and therefore they should be able to read the gas 
meter which indicates their consumption of gas. Such gas 
meters are furnished by the companies, and can be read 
easily.
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 GENERAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 
The instrument itself is somewhat complex. ‘It will suffice 
to say that within the meter box are thin disks which are 
moved by the stream of gas that passes them. This move- 
ment of the disks is recorded by clockwork devices on a dial 
face. In this way, the number of cubic feet of gas which 
pass through the meter is automatically registered. 
89. The Relation between Pressure and 
Volume. It was long known that as the 
pressure of a gas increases, that is, as it 
becomes compressed, its volume de- 
creases, but Robert Boyle was the first 
to determine the exact relation between 
the volume and the pressure of a gas. 
He did this in a very simple manner. 
Pour mercury into a U-shaped tube un- 
> til the level of the mercury in the closed 
end of the tube is the same as the level 
in the open end. The air in the long 
Bee aeine tees. arm is pressing upon the mercury in that 
sure on. the gas in- arm, and is tending to force it up the short 
creases, His volume de- arm, The air in the short closed arm is 
pressing down upon the mercury in that 
arm and tending to send it up the long arm. Since the mer- 
cury is at the same level in the two arms, the pressure in the 
long arm must be equal to the pressure in the short arm. 
But the long arm is open, and the pressure in that arm is 
the pressure of the atmosphere. Therefore the pressure in 
the short arm must be one atmosphere. Measure the distance 
éc between the top of the mercury and the closed end of the 
tube. 
Pour more mercury into the open end of the tube, and as 
the mercury rises higher and higher in the long arm, note 
carefully the decrease in the volume of the air in the short
-P-A-G-E-97
  
HEAT DUE TO COMPRESSION 97 
arm. Pour mercury into the tube until the difference in level 
bd is just equal to the barometric height, approximately 32 
inches. The pressure of the air in the closed end now sup- 
ports the pressure of one atmosphere, and in addition, a 
column of mercury equal to another atmosphere. If now the 
air column in the closed end is measured, its volume will be 
only one half of its former volume. By doubling the pres- 
sure we have reduced the volume one half. Similarly, if the 
pressure is increased threefold, the volume will be reduced 
to one third of the original volume. 
90. Heat due to Compression. We saw in Section 89 that 
whenever the pressure exerted upon a gas is increased, the 
volume of the gas is decreased; and that whenever the pres- 
sure upon a gas is decreased, the volume of the gas is in- 
creased. If the pressure is changed very slowly, the change 
in the temperature of the gas is imperceptible; if, however, 
the pressure is removed suddenly, the temperature falls 
rapidly, or if the pressure is applied suddenly, the temperature 
rises rapidly. When bicycle tires are being inflated, the 
pump becomes hot because of the compression of the air. 
The amount of heat resulting from compression is surpris- 
ingly large ; for example, if a mass of gas at 0° C. is suddenly 
compressed to one half its original volume, its temperature 
rises 87° C. 
gi. Cooling by Expansion. If a gas expands suddenly, its 
temperature falls; for example, if a mass of gas at 87° C. is 
allowed to expand rapidly to twice its original volume, its 
temperature falls to 0° C. If the compressed air of a bicycle 
tire is allowed to expand and a sensitive thermometer is held 
in the path of the escaping air, the thermometer will show a 
decided drop in temperature. 
The low temperature obtained by the expansion of air or 
other gases is utilized commercially on a large scale. By

-P-A-G-E-98
  98 GENERAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 
means of powerful pistons air is compressed to one third or 
one fourth its original volume, is passed through a coil of 
pipe surrounded with cold water, and is then allowed to 
escape into large refrigerating vaults, which thereby have 
_ their temperatures noticeably lowered, and can be used for 
the permanent storage of meats, fruits, and other perishable 
material. In summer, when the atmospheric temperature is 
high, the storage and preservation of foods is of vital impor- 
tance to factories and cold storage houses, and but for the low 
temperature obtainable by the expansion of compressed gases, 
much of our food supply would be lost to use. 
92. Unexpected Transformations. If the pressure on a 
gas is greatly increased, a sudden transformation sometimes 
occurs and the gas becomes a liquid. Then, if the pressure 
is reduced, a second transformation occurs, and the liquid 
evaporates or returns to its original form as a gas. 
In Section 23 we saw that a fall of temperature caused 
water vapor to condense or liquefy. If temperature alone were 
considered, most gases could not be liquefied, because the tem- 
perature at which the average gas liquefies is so low as to be 
out of the range of possibility; it has been calculated, for 
example, that a temperature of 252° C. below zero would have 
to be obtained in order to liquefy hydrogen. 
Some gases can be easily transformed into liquids by pres- 
sure alone, some gases can be easily transformed into liquids 
by cooling alone; on the other hand, many gases are so 
difficult to liquefy that both pressure and low temperature are 
needed to produce the desired result. Ifa gas is cooled and 
compressed at the same time, liquefaction occurs much more 
surely and easily than though either factor alone were de- 
pended upon. The air which surrounds us, and of whose ex- 
istence we are scarcely aware, can be reduced to the-form of 
a liquid, but the pressure exerted upon the portion to be lique-
-P-A-G-E-99
ARTIFICIAL ICE 99 
fied must be thirty-nine times as great as the atmospheric 
pressure, and the temperature must have been reduced to a 
very low point. 
93- Artificial Ice. Ammonia gas is liquefied by strong pres- 
sure and low temperature and is then allowed to flow into pipes 
which run through tanks containing salt water. The reduction 
of pressure causes the liquid to evaporate or turn to a gas, 
and the fall of temperature which always accompanies evapo- 
ration means a lowering of the temperature of the salt water 
to 16° or 18° below zero. But immersed in the salt water are 
molds containing pure water, and since the freezing point of

water is 0° C., the water in the molds freezes and can be drawn 
from the mold as solid cakes of ice. 
Ammonia gas is driven by the pump C into the coil D 
(Fig. 56) under a pressure strong enough to liquefy it, the 
heat generated by this compression being carried off by cold 
water which constantly circulates through 4. The liquid 
ammonia flows through the regulating valve V into the coil £, 
in which the pressure is kept low by the pump C. The ac- 
companying expansion reduces the temperature to a very low 
degree, and the brine which circulates around the coil £ ac- 
« quires a temperature below the freezing point of pure water. 
The cold brine passes from A to a tank in which are im- 
mersed cans filled with water, and within a short time thc 
water in the cans is frozen into solid cakes of ice.

  CHAPTER IX 
17) INVISIBLE OBJECTS 
94. Very Small Objects. We saw in Section 84 that gases 
have a tendency to expand, but that they can be compressed 
by the application of force.- This observation has led scien- 
tists to suppose that substances are composed of very minute 
particles called molecules, separated by small spaces called 
pores; and that when a gas is condensed, the pores become 
smaller, and that when a gas expands, the pores become larger. 
The fact that certain substances are soluble, like sugar in 
water, shows that the molecules of sugar find a lodging place 
in the spaces or pores between the molecules of water, in 
much the same way that pebbles find lodgment in the chinks 
of the coal in a coal scuttle. An indefinite quantity of sugar 
cannot be dissolved in a given quantity of liquid, because 
after a certain amount of sugar has been dissolved all the 
pores become filled, and there is no available molecular space. 
The remainder of the sugar settles at the bottom of the ves- 
sel, and cannot be dissolved by any amount of stirring. 
If a piece of potassium permanganate about the size of a 
grain of sand is put into a quart of water, the solid disappears 
and the water becomes a deep rich red. The solid evidently 
has dissolved and has broken up into minute particles which 
are too small to be seen, but which have scattered themselves 
and lodged in the pores of the water, thus giving the water 
its rich color.

-P-A-G-E-101
  JOURNEYS MADE BY MOLECULES IOI 
There is no visible proof of the existence of molecules 
and molecular spaces, because not only are our eyes unable 
to see them directly, but even the most powerful microscope 
cannot make them visible to us. They are so small that if 
one thousand of them were laid side by side, they would 
make a speck too small to be seen by the eye and too small 
to be visible under the most powerful microscope. 
We cannot see molecules or molecular pores, but the phe- 
nomena of compression and expansion, solubility and other 
equally convincing facts, have led us to conclude that all 
substances are composed of very minute particles or mole- 
cules separated by spaces called pores. 
95- Journeys Made by Molecules. If.a gas jet is turned 
on and not lighted, an odor of gas soon becomes perceptible, 
not only throughout the room, but in adjacent halls and even 
in distant rooms. An uncorked bottle of cologne scents an 
entire room, the odor of a rose or violet permeates the 
atmosphere near and far. These simple everyday occur- 
rences seem to show that the molecules of a gas must be in a 
state of continual and rapid motion. In the case of the 
cologne, some molecules must have escaped from the liquid 
by the process of evaporation and traveled through the air to 
the nose. We know that the molecules of a liquid are in 
motion and are continually passing into the air because in 
time the vessel becomes empty. The only way in which this 
could happen would be for the molecules of the liquid to pass 
from the liquid into the surrounding medium; but this is 
really saying that the molecules are in motion. 
From these phenomena and others it is reasonably clear 
that substances are composed of molecules, and that mole- 
cules are not inert, quiet particles, but that they are in in- 
cessant motion, moving rapidly hither and thither, sometimes 
traveling far, sometimes near. Even the log of wood which
-P-A-G-E-102
  102 INVISIBLE OBJECTS 
lies heavy and motionless on our woodpile is made up of 
countless billions of molecules each in rapid incessant motion. 
The molecules of solid bodies cannot escape so readily as 
those of liquids and gases, and do not travel far. The log 
lies year after year in an apparently motionless condition, 
but if one’s eyes were keen enough, the molecules would be 
seen moving among themselves, even though they cannot 
escape into the surrounding medium and make long journeys 
as do the molecules of liquids and gases. 
96. The Companions of Molecules. Common sense tells us 
that a molecule of water is not the same as a molecule of 
vinegar; the molecules of each are extremely small and in 
rapid motion, but they differ essentially, otherwise one sub- 
stance would be like every other substance. What is it that 
makes a molecule of water differ from a molecule of vinegar, 
and each differ from all other molecules? Strange to say, a 
molecule is not a simple object, but is quite complex, being 
composed of one or more smaller particles, called atoms, and 
the number and kind of atoms in a molecule determine the 
type of the molecule, and the type of the molecule deter- 
mines the substance. For example, a glass of water is com- 
posed of untold millions of molecules, and each molecule is 
a company of three still smaller particles, one of which is 
called the oxygen atom and two of which are alike in every 
particular and are called hydrogen atoms. 
97. Simple Molecules. Generally molecules are composed 
of atoms which are different in kind. For example, the 
molecule of water has ‘two different atoms, the oxygen atom 
and the hydrogen atoms; alcohol has three different kinds 
of atoms, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. Sometimes, how- 
ever, molecules are composed of a group of atoms all of 
which are alike. Now there are but seventy or eighty differ- 
ent kinds of atoms, and hence there can be but seventy or
-P-A-G-E-103
  SIMPLE MOLECULES 103 
eighty different substances whose molecules are composed of 
atoms which are alike. When the atoms comprising a mole- 
cule are all alike, the substance is called an element, and is 
said to be a simple substance. Throughout the length and 
breadth of this vast world of ours there are only about eighty 
known elements. An element is the simplest substance con- 
ceivable, because it has not been separated into anything 
simpler. Water is a compound substance. It can be sepa- 
rated into oxygen and hydrogen. 
Gold, silver, and lead are examples of elements, and water, 
alcohol, cider, sand, and marble are complex substances, or 
compounds, as we are apt to call them. Everything, no 
matter what its size or shape or character, is formed from the 
various combinations into molecules of a few simple atoms, of 
which there exist about eighty known different kinds. But 
few of the eighty known elements play an important part in 
our every-day life. The elements in which we are most 
interested are given in the following table, and the symbols 
by which they are known are placed in columns to the right: 
Oxygen O° Copper Cu Phosphorus iP 
Hydrogen H Iodine I Potassium K 
Carbon c Iron Fe Silver Ag 
Aluminium = Al Lead Pb Sodium Na 
Calcium Ca Nickel Ni Sulphur Ss 
Chlorine cl Nitrogen N Tin Sn 
We have seen in an earlier experiment that twice as much 
hydrogen as oxygen can be obtained from water. Two atoms 
of the element hydrogen unite with one atom of the element 
oxygen to make one molecule of water. In symbols we ex- 
press this H,O. A group of symbols, such as this, expressing 
a molecule of a compound is called a formula. NaCl is the 
formula for sodium chloride, which is the chemical name of 
common salt.

LIGHT 
98. What Light Does for Us. Heat keeps us warm, cooks 
our food, drives our engines, and in a thousand ways makes 
life comfortable and pleasant, but what should we do without 
light? How many of us could be happy even though warm 
and well fed if we were forced to live in the dark where the 
sunbeams never flickered, where the shadows never stole across 
the floor, and where the soft twilight could not tell us that the 
day was done? Heat and light are the two most important 
physical factors in life; we cannot say which is the more nec- 
essary, because in the extreme cold or arctic regions man 
cannot live, and in the dark places where the light never pene- 
trates man sickens and dies. Both heat and light are essen- 
tial to life, and each has its own part to play in the varied 
existence of man and plant and animal. 
Light enables us to see the world around us, makes the 
beautiful colors of the trees and flowers, enables us to read, 
is essential to the taking of photographs, gives us our moving 
pictures and our magic lanterns, produces the exquisite tints 
of stained-glass windows, and brings us the joy of the rain- 
bow. We do not always realize that light is beneficial, because 
sometimes it fades our clothing and our carpets, and burns 
our skin and makes it sore. But we shall see that even these 
apparently harmful effects of light are in reality of great 
value in man’s constant battle against disease. 
99. The Candle. Natural heat and light are furnished by 
the sun, but the absence of the sun during the evening 
makes artificial light necessary, and even during the day 
104
-P-A-G-E-105
  
  FADING [LLUMINATION 105 
artificial light is needed in buildings whose structure excludes 
the natural light of the sun. Artificial light is furnished by 
electricity, by gas, by oil in lamps, and in numerous other 
ways. Until modern times candles were the main source of 
light, and indeed to-day the intensity, or power, of any light 
is measured in candle power units, just as length is measured 
in yards; for example, an average gas jet gives a 10 candle 
power light, or is ten times as bright as a candle; an ordinary 
incandescent electric light gives a 16 candle power light, or 
furnishes sixteen times as much light asacandle. Very strong 
large oil lamps can at times yield a light of 60 candle power, 
while the large arc lamps which flash out on the street 
corners are said to furnish 1200 times as much light as a 
single candle. Naturally all candles do not give the same 
amount of light, nor are all candles alike in size. The 
candles which decorate our tea tables are of wax, while 
those which serve for general use are of paraffin and tallow. 
    5 
FIG. 57.—A photograph at a@ receives four times as much light as when held at 4, 
100. Fading Illumination. The farther we move from a 
light, the less strong, or intense, is the illumination which 
reaches us; the light of the street lamp on the corner fades 
and becomes dim before the middle of the block is reached, 
so that we look eagerly for the next lamp. The light dimin- 
ishes in brightness much more rapidly than we realize, as the 
following simple experiment will show. Let a single candle
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 LIGHT 
(Fig. 57) serve as our light, and at ‘a distance of one foot 
from the candle place a photograph. In this position the 
photograph receives a definite amount of light from the candle 
and has a certain brightness. 
If now we place a similar photograph directly behind the first 
photograph and at a distance of two feet from the candle, the 
second photograph receives no light because the first one cuts 
off all the light. If, however, the first photograph is removed, 
the light which fell on it passes outward and spreads itself over 
a larger area, until at the distance of the second photograph 
the light spreads itself over four times as large an area as for- 
merly. At this distance, then, the illumination on the second 
photograph is only one fourth as strong as it was on a similar 
photograph held at a distance of one foot from the candle. 
The photograph or object placed at a distance of one foot 
from a light is well illuminated; if it is placed at a distance 
of two feet, the illumination is only one fourth as strong, and if 
the object is placed three feet away, the illumination is only one 
ninth as strong. This fact should make us have thought and 
care in the use of our eyes. We think we are sixteen times as 
welloff with our incandescent lights as our ancestors were with 
simple candles, but we must reflect that our ancestors kept the 
candle near them, “at their elbow,” so to speak, while we sit at 
some distance from the light and unconcernedly read and sew. 
As an object recedes from a light the illumination which it 
receives diminishes rapidly, for the strength of the illumina- 
tion is inversely proportional to the square of distance of the 
object from the light. Our ancestors with a candle-at a dis- 
tance of one foot from a book were as well off as we are with 
an incandescent light four feet away. 
tor. Money Value of Light. Light is bought and sold al- 
most as readily as are the products of farm and dairy; many 
factories, churches, and apartments pay a definite sum for
-P-A-G-E-107
  MONEY VALVE OF LIGHT 107 
electric light of a standard strength, and naturally full value 
is desired. An instrument for measuring the strength of 
a light is called a photometer, and there are many different 
varieties, just as there are varieties of scales which measure 
household articles. One light-measuring scale depends upon 
the law that the intensity of illumination decreases with the 
square of the distance of the object from the light. Sup- 
pose we wish to measure the strength of the electric light 
bulbs in our homes, in order to see whether we are getting 
the specified illumination. In front of a screen place a black 
rod (Fig. 58) which is illuminated by two different lights; 
namely, a _ standard 
candle and an_incan- 
descent bulb whose 
strength is to be meas- 
ured. Two shadows of 
the rod will fall on the 
screen, one caused by 
the candle and the other 
caused by the incandescent light. The shadow due to the latter 
source is not so dark as that due to the candle. Now let the 
incandescent light be moved away from the screen until the 
two shadows are of equal darkness. If the incandescent light 
is four times as far away from the screen as the candle, and 
the shadows are equal, we know, by Section 100, that its 
strength is sixteen candle power. If the incandescent light 
is four times as far away from the screen as the candle is, its 
power must be sixteen times as great, and we know the com- 
pany is furnishing the standard amount of light for a sixteen 
candle power electric bulb. If, however, the bulb must be 
moved nearer to the rod in order that the two shadows may 
be similar then the light given by the bulb is less than sixteen 
candle power, and less than that due the consumer.

in a card, and the card 
is held in front of a light, the card casts a shadow, in the cen- 
ter of which is a bright spot. The light, the hole, and the 
bright spot are all in the same straight line. These simple 
observations lead us to think that light travels in a straight 
line. 
We can always tell the direction from which light comes, 
either by the shadow cast or by the bright spot formed when 
an opening occurs in the opaque object casting the shadow. 
If the shadow of a tree falls towards the west, we know the 
sun must be in the east; if a bright spot is on the floor, we 
can easily locate the light whose rays stream through an 
opening and form the bright spot. We know that light 
travels in a straight line, and following the path of the beam 
which comes to our eyes, we are sure to locate the light. 
103. Good and Bad Mirrors. As we walk along the street, 
we frequently see ourselves reflected in the shop windows, in 
polished metal signboards, in the metal trimmings of wagons 
and automobiles; but in mirrors we get the best image of 
ourselves. We resent the image given by a piece of tin, be- 
cause the reflection is distorted and does not picture us as we 
really are; a rough surface does not give a fair representa- 
tion; if we want a true image of ourselves, we, must use a 
smooth surface like a mirror as a reflector. If the water in a
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE PATH OF LIGHT 109 
pond is absolutely still, we get a clear, true image of the trees, 
but if there are ripples on the surface, the reflection is blurred 
and distorted. A metal roof reflects so much light that the 
eyes are dazzled by it, and a whitewashed fence injures the 
eyes because of the glare which comes from the reflected 
light. Neither of these could be called mirrors, however, be- 
cause although they reflect light, they reflect it so irregularly 
that not even a suggestion of an image can be obtained. 
Most of us are sufficiently familiar with mirrors to know 
that the image is a duplicate of ourselves with regard to size, 
shape, color, and expression, but that it appears to be back of 
the mirror, while we are actually in front of the mirror. The 
image appears not only behind the mirror, but it is also ex- 
actly as far back of the mirror as we are in front of it; if we 
approach the mirror, the image also draws nearer ; if we with- 
draw, it likewise recedes. 
E _104. The Path of Light. If a mirror or any other polished 
surface is held in the path of a sunbeam, some of the light is 
reflected, and by rotating the mirror the reflected sunbeam 
may be made to take any path. School children amuse 
themselves by reflecting sunbeams from a mirror into their 
companions’ faces. If the companion moves his head. in order 
to avoid the reflected beam, his tormentor moves or inclines 
the mirror and flashes the beam back to his victim’s face. 
If a mirror is held so that a ray of light strikes it in a 
perpendicular direction, the light is reflected backward along 
the path by which it came. If, however, the light makes an 
angle with the mirror, its direction is changed, and it leaves 
the mirror along a new path. By observation we learn that 
when a beam strikes the mirror and makes an angle of 30° 
with the perpendicular, the beam is reflected in such a way 
that its new path also makes an angle of 30° with the per- 
pendicular. If the sunbeam strikes the mirror at an angle of

  32° with the perpendicular, the path of the reflected ray also

dent ray (AC) makes with 
the perpendicular (BC) to 
the mirror, at the point 
where the ray strikes the 
mirror, is called the angle 
of incidence. The angle

such a way that the angle

bounces a ball makes use 
of this law, but he uses

  WHY OBJECTS ARE VISIBLE IIL 
105. Why the Image seems to be behind the Mirror. If a 
candle is placed infront of a mirror, as in Figure 62, one of 
the rays of light which 
leaves the candle will fall 
upon the mirror as AB and 
will be reflected as BC (in 
such a way that the angle 
of reflection equals the 
angle of incidence). If an 
observer stands at C, he We 
will think that the point A jig. Go. —-The image is a duplicate of the 
of the candle is somewhere object, but appears to be behind the 
along the line CB extended. ee 
Such a supposition would be justified from Section 102. But 
the candle sends out light in all directions; one ray therefore 
will strike the mirror as AD and will be reflected as DZ, and an 
observer at £ will think that the point A of the candle is 
somewhere along the line ED. In order that both observers 
may be correct, that is, in order that the light may seem to be 
in both these directions, the image of the point A must seem 
to be at the intersection of the two lines. Ina similar manner 
it can be shown that every point of the image of the candle 
seems to be behind the mirror. 
It can be shown by experiment that the distance of the 
image behind the mirror is equal to the distance of the object 
in front of the mirror. 
106. Why Objects are Visible. If the beam of light falls 
upon a sheet of paper, or upon a photograph, instead of upon 
a smooth polished surface, no definite reflected ray will be 
seen, but a glare will be produced by the scattering of the 
beam of light. The surface of the paper or photograph is 
rough, and as a result, it scatters the beam in every direction. 
It is hard for us to realize that a smooth sheet of paper is      
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 LIGHT 
by no means so smooth as it looks. It is rough compared 
with a polished mirror. The law of reflection always holds, 
however, no matter what the reflecting surface is, — the angle 
of reflection always equals the 
angle of incidence. Inasmooth 
body the reflected beams are all 
parallel; in a rough body, the 
reflected beams are inclined to 
each other in all sorts of ways, 
and no two beams leave the 
paper in exactly the same direc- 
tion.

their own light, and are self- 
luminous. Objects like chairs, tables, carpets, have no light 
within themselves and are visible only when they receive light 
from a luminous source and reflect that light. We know that 
these objects are not self-luminous, because they are not visi- 
ble at night unless a lamp or gas is burning. When light 
from any luminous object falls upon books, desks, or dishes, 
it meets rough surfaces, and hence undergoes diffuse reflec- 
tion, and is scattered irregularly in all directions. No matter 
where the eye is, some reflected rays enter it, and the various 
objects are clearly seen.

seems to be broken at the surface of the liquid, the handle of 
a teaspoon in a cup of : 
water appears broken, and 
objects seen through a 
glass of water may seem

size. When light passes 
from air into water, orfrom , 
any transparent substance 
into another of different 
density, its direction is 
changed, and it emerges 
along an entirely new path 
(Fig. 64). We know that light rays pass through glass, 
because we can see through the window panes and through 
out spectacles; we know that light rays pass through 
water, because we can see through a glass of clear water; 
on the other hand, light rays cannot pass through wood, 
leather, metal, etc. ‘ 
Whenever light meets a transparent substance obliquely, 
some of it is reflected, undergoing a change in its direction ; 
and some of it passes onward through the medium, but the.

latter portion passes onward along a new path. The ray RO 
(Fig. 65) passes obliquely through the air to the surface of 
the water, but, on entering the 
water, it is bent or refracted and 
takes the new path OS. The 
angle AOR is called the angle 
of incidence. The angle POS 
is called the angle of refraction. 
The angle of refraction is the 
angle formed by the refracted 
SB ray and the perpendicular to the 
Bees ae eet os ers surface at the point where the 
light strikes it. 
When light passes from air into water or glass, the re- 
fracted ray is bent toward the perpendicular, so that the 
angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence. 
When a ray of light passes from water or glass into air, 
the refracted ray is bent away from the perpendicular so 
that the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of 
incidence. : 
The bending or deviation of light in its passage from one 
substance to another is called refraction. 
108. How Refraction Deceives us.. Refraction is the source 
of many illusions; bent rays of light make objects appear 
where they really are not.

learned that the atmosphere varies in density from level to 
level; hence all the light which travels through the atmos- 
phere is constantly deviated from its original path, and before 
the light reaches the eye it has undergone many changes in 
direction. Now we learned in Section 102, that the direction 
of the rays of light as they enter the eye determines the di- 
rection in which an object is seen; hence the sun, moon, 
and stars seem to be along the lines which enter the eye, 
although in reality they are not. ( 
tog. Uses of Refraction. If it were not for refraction, or 
the deviation of light in its passage from medium to medium, 
the wonders and beauties of the magic lantern and the cam- 
era would be unknown to us; sun, moon, and stars could not 
be made to yield up their distant secrets to us in photographs ; 
the comfort and help of spectacles would be lacking, spec- 
tacles which have helped unfold to many the rare beauties of 
nature, such as a clear view of clouds and sunset, of humming 
bee and flying bird. Books with their wealth of entertain- 
ment and information would be sealed to a large part of man- 
kind, if glasses did not assist weak eyes. 
By refraction the magnifying glass reveals objects hidden 
because of their minuteness, and enlarges for our careful con- 
templation objects otherwise barely visible. The watchmaker, 
unassisted by the magnifying glass, could not detect the tiny 
grains of dust or sand which clog the delicate wheels of our 
watches. The merchant, with his lens, examines the separate 
threads of woolen and silk fabrics to determine the strength 
and value of the material. The physician, with his invaluable 
microscope, counts the number of infinitesimal corpuscles in 
the blood and bases his prescription on that count; he ex- 
amines the sputum of a patient to determine whether tuber- 
culosis wastes the system. The bacteriologist with the same 
instrument scrutinizes the drinking water and learns whether

the dangerous typhoid germs are present. The future of 
medicine will depend somewhat upon the additional secrets 
which man is able to force from nature through the use 
of powerful lenses, because as lenses have, in the past, 
been the means of revealing disease germs, so in the fu- 
ture more powerful lenses may serve to bring to light 
germs yet unknown. How refraction accomplishes these 
results will be explained in the following Sections. 
(Ho. The Window Pane. We have seen that light is bent 
when it passes from one medium to another of different 
density, and that objects viewed by refracted light do not ap- 
pear in their proper positions. 
When a ray of light passes through a piece of plane glass, 
such as a window pane (Fig. 67), it is refracted at the point B 
toward the perpendicular, and 
continues its course through 
the glass in the new direc- 
tion BC. On emerging from 
the glass, the light is re 
fracted away from the perpen- 
dicular and takes the direc- 
tion CD, which is clearly par- 
allel to its original direction. 
Hence, when we view objects

position, but otherwise un- 
changed. The deviation or displacement caused by glass as 
thin as window panes is too slight to be noticed, and we are 
not conscious that objects are out of position. 
111. Chandelier Crystals and Prisms. When a ray of light 
passes through plane glass, like a window pane, it is shifted 
somewhat, but its direction does not. change; that is, the

emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray. But when a 
beam of light passes through a triangular glass prism, such 
as a chandelier crystal, its direction is greatly changed, and 
an object viewed through a 
prism is seen quite out of its 
true position. 
Whenever light passes through 
a prism, it is bent toward the 
base of the prism, or toward the 
thick portion of the prism, and 
emerges from the prism in quite Frc, 68.— When looked at through

placed as in Figure 69, and rounded off, would make a very 
good convex lens. A lens is any transparent material, but , 
usually glass, with one or 
both sides curved. The 
various types of lenses 
are shown in Figure 71. 
The first three types 
focus parallel rays at 
some common point /, as 
in Figure 69. Such lenses are called convex or converging 
lenses. The last three types, called concave lenses, scatter 
parallel rays so that they do not come to a focus, but di- 
verge widely after passage through the lens. 
113. The Shape and Material of a Lens. The main or 
principal focus of a lens, that is, the point at which rays 
parallel to the base line AB 
meet (Fig. 71), depends 
upon the shape of the lens. oe 
For example, a thick lens, 
suchas A (Fig. 72), focuses A 
the rays very near to the 
lens; 8, which is not so P 
thick, focuses the rays at a 
greater distance from the B 
lens; and C, whichis a very 
thin lens, focuses the rays 
at a considerable distance 
from the lens. The distance ei

the focal length.

-P-A-G-E-119
HOW LENSES FORM IMAGES 119 
The position of the principal focus depends not only on the 
shape of the lens, but also on the refractive power of the 
material composing the lens. A lens made of ice would not 
deviate the rays of light so much asa lens of similar shape 
composed of glass. The greater the refractive power of the 
lens, the greater the bending, and the nearer the principal 
focus to the lens. 
There are many different kinds of glass, and each kind of 
glass refracts the light differently. Flint glass contains lead ; 
the lead makes the glass dense, and gives it great refractive 
power, enabling it to bend and separate light in all directions. 
Cut glass and toilet articles are made of flint glass because 
of the brilliant effects caused by its great refractive power, 
and imitation gems are commonly nothing more than polished 
flint glass. 
114. How Lenses Form Images. Suppose we place an arrow, 
A, in front of a convex lens (Fig. 73). The ray AC, parallel 
to the principal axis, will 
pass through the lens 
and emerge as DE. The 
ray is always bent 
toward the thick portion 
of the lens, both at its

the lens. 
In Section 105, we saw that two rays determine the posi- 
tion of any point of our image; hence in order to locate the 
image of the top of the arrow, we need to consider but one 
more ray from the top of the object. The most convenient 
ray to choose would be one passing through O, the optical 
center of the lens, because such a ray passes through the lens 
unchanged in direction, as is clear from Figure 74. The point 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 
  REFRACTION 
where AC and AO meet after refraction will be the position 
of the top of the arrow. 
FIG. 74.—Rays above O are bent downward, those 
below O are bent upward, and rays through O 
emerge from the lens unchanged in direction. Similarly it can be shown that the 
‘center of the arrow will 
be at the point 7, and 
we see that the image 
is larger than the ob- 
ject. This can be 
easily proved experi- 
mentally. Let a con- 
vex lens be placed 
near a candle (Fig. 75); 
move a paper screen 
back and forth be- 
hind the lens; for some position of the screen a clear, enlarged 
image of the candle will be made. 
If the candle or arrow is 
placed in a new position, say at 
MA (Fig. 76), the image formed 
is smaller than the object, and 
is nearer to the lens than it 
was before. Move the lens so 
that its distance from the candle 
is increased, and then find the 
image on a piece of paper.

  position that the image of the candle 
is larger than the object. 
The size and position of the image 
depend upon the distance 
of the object from the 
lens (Fig. 77). By means 
of a lens one can easily 
get on a visiting card a 
picture of a distant church

possible to have a photograph 
of a tall tree or building unless the see were as large 
as the tree itself. . When a photographer takes a photograph 
of a person or a tree, he moves his camera until the image 
formed by the lens is of the desired size. By bringing the 
camera (really the lens of the camera) near, we obtain a large- 
sized photograph; by increasing the distance between the 
camera and the object, a smaller photograph is obtained. 
The mountain top may be so far distant that in the photo- 
graph it will not appear to be greater than a small stone. 
Many familiar illustrations of lenses, or curved refracting 
surfaces, and their work, are known to allof us. Fish globes 
magnify the fish that swim within. Bottles can be so shaped 
that they make the olives, pickles, and peaches that they 
contain appear larger,,than they really are. The. fruit_in 
bottles frequently seems too large to have gone through the 
neck of the bottle.. The deception is due to refraction, and 
the material and shape of the bottle furnish a sufficient expla- 
nation. : 
By using combinations of two or more lenses of various 
kinds, it is possible to have an image of almost any desired 
size, and in practically any desired position. 
y116. The Human Eye. In Section 114, we obtained on a 
movable screen, by.means of a simple lens, an image of a

candle. The human eye possesses a most wonderful lens and 
screen (Fig. 78); the lens is called the crystalline lens, and 
the screen is called the retina. Rays 
of light pass from the object through 
the pupil P, go through the crystal- 
line lens Z, where they are refracted, 
and then pass onward to the retina 
A, where they form a distinct image 
of the object. 
We learned in Section 114 that a 
change in the position of the object 
necessitated a change in the position 
Fic. 78. — The eye. of the screen, and that every time the 
object was moved the position of the 
screen had to be altered before a clear image of the object 
could be obtained. The retina of the eye cannot be moved 
backward and forward, as the screen was, and the crystalline 
lens is permanently located directly back of the iris. How, 
then, does it happen that we can see clearly both near and 
distant objects; that the printed page which is held in the 
hand is visible at one second, and that the church spire on 
the distant horizon is visible the instant the eyes are raised 
from the book? How is it possible to obtain on an immov- 
able screen by means of a simple lens two distinct images of 
objects at widely varying distances? 
The answer to these questions is that the crystalline lens 
changes shape according to need. The lens is attached to 
the eye by means of small muscles, m, and it is by the action 
of these muscles that the lens is able to become small and thick, 
or large and thin; that is, to become more or less curved. 
When we look at near objects, the muscles act in such a way 
that the lens bulges out, and becomes thick in the middle and 
of the right curvature to focus the near object upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  FARSIGHTEDNESS AND NEARSIGHTEDNESS 123 
screen. When we look at an object several hundred feet 
away, the muscles change their pull on the lens and flatten it 
until it is of the proper curvature for the new distance. The 
adjustment of the muscles is so quick and unconscious that 
we normally do not experience any difficulty in changing our 
range of view. The ability of the eye to adjust itself to vary- 
ing distances is called accommodation. The power of adjust- 
ment in general decreases with age. i 
117. Farsightedness and Nearsightedness. A farsighted 
person is one who cannot see near objects so distinctly as far 
objects, and who in many cases cannot see near objects at all. 
The eyeball of a farsighted person is very short, and the 
retina is too close to the crystalline lens. Near objects are 
brought to a focus behind the retina instead of on it, and 
hence are not visible. Even though, the muscles of accommo- 
dation do their best to bulge.and thicken the lens, the rays of 
light are not bent sufficiently to focus sharply on the retina. 
In consequence objects look blurred. Farsightedness can 
be remedied by convex glasses, since they bend the light

and bring it toa closer focus. Convex glasses, by bending the 
rays and bringing them to a nearer focus, overbalance a short 
eyeball with its tendency to focus objects behind the retina. 
A nearsighted person is one who cannot see objects unless 
they are close to the eye. The eyeball of a nearsighted per- 
son is very wide, and the retina is too far away from the crys- 
talline lens. Far objects are brought to a focus in front of 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
    124 REFRACTION 
the retina instead of on it, and hence are not visible. Even 
though the muscles of accommodation do their best to pull out 
and flatten the lens, the rays are not separated sufficiently to, 
focus as far back as the retina. In consequence objects look 
meme Fic. 8r.—The nearsighted eye. The defect is remedied by concave glasses, 
blurred. Nearsightedness can be remedied by wearing con- 
_ Cave glasses, since they separate the light and move the focus 
farther away. Concave glasses, by separating the rays and 
making the focus more distant, overbalance a wide eyeball 
with'its tendency to focus objects in front of the retina. 
118. Headache and Eyes. Ordinarily the muscles of ac- 
commodation adjust themselves easily and quickly; if, how- 
ever, they do not, frequent and severe headaches occur as a 
result of too great muscular effort toward accommodation. 
Among young people headaches are frequéntly caused by 
over-exertion of the crystalline muscles. Glasses relieve the 
muscles of the extra adjustment, and hence are effective in 
eliminating this cause of headache. 
An exact balance is required between glasses, crystalline 
lens, and muscular activity, and only those who have studied 
the subject carefully are competent to treat so sensitive and 
necessary a part of the body as the eye. The least mistake 
in the curvature of the glasses, the least flaw in the type of 
glass (for example, the kind of glass used), means an im- 
proper focus, increased duty for the muscles, and gradual 
weakening of the entire eye, Powe by headache and

  EYE STRAIN 125 
119. Eye Strain. The extra work which is thrown upon 
the nervous system through seeing, reading, writing, and 
sewing with defective eyes is recognized by all physicians 
as an important cause of disease. The tax made upon the 
nervous system by the defective eye lessens the supply of 
energy available for other bodily use, and the general health 
suffers. The health is improved when proper glasses are 
prescribed. 
Possibly the greatest danger of eye strain is among school 
children, who are not experienced enough to recognize defects 
in sight. For this reason, many schools employ a physician 
who examines the pupils’ eyes at regular intervals. 
The following general precautions are worth observing : — 
‘1. Rest the eyes when they hurt, and as far as possible do 
close work, such as writing, reading, sewing, wood carving, 
etc., by daylight. 
2. Never read in a very bright or a very dim light. 
3. If the light is near, have it shaded. 
4. Do not rub the eyes with the fingers. 
5. If eyes are weak, bathe them in lukewarm water in 
which a pinch of borax has been dissolved.

120. The Magic of the Sun. Ribbons and dresses washed 
and. hung in the sun fade; when washed and hung in the 
shade, they are not so apt to lose their color. Clothes are 
laid away in drawers ‘and hung in closets not only for pro- 
tection against dust, but also against the well-known power 
of light to weaken color. 
‘Many housewives lower the window shades that the wall 
paper may not lose its brilliancy, that the beautiful hues of 
velvet, satin, and plush tapestry may not be marred by loss in 
brilliancy and sheen. Bright carpets and rugs are sometimes 
bought in preference to more delicately tinted ones, because 
the purchaser knows that the latter will fade quickly if used 
in a sunny room, and will soon acquire a dull mellow tone. 
The bright and gay colors and the dull and somber colors are all 
affected by the sun, but why one should be affected more 
than another we do not know. Thousands of brilliant and 
dainty hues catch our eye in the shop and on the street, but 
not one of them is absolutely permanent ; some may last for 
years, but there is always more or less fading in time. 
Sunlight causes many strange, unexplained effects. If the 
two substances, chlorine and hydrogen, are mixed in a dark 
room, nothing remarkable occurs any more than though water 
and milk were mixed, but if a mixture of these substances is 
exposed to sunlight, a violent explosion occurs and an entirely 
new substance is formed, a compound entirely different in 
character from either of its components. 
126 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE MAGIC WAND 1N PHOTOGRAPHY 127 
By some power not understood by man, the sun is able to 
form new substances. In the dark, chlorine and hydrogen 
are simply chlorine and hydrogen; in the sunlight they com- 
bine as if by magic into a totally different substance. By the 
same unexplained power, the sun frequently does just the op- 
posite work; instead of combining two substances to make 
one new product, the sun may separate or break down some 
particular substance into its various elements. For example, 
when the sunshine falls upon silver chloride a chemical action 
immediately begins. Some chlorine gas escapes. Some sil- 
ver is also liberated, but it reacts with the, as yet, unaffected 
silver chloride and gives it a red or purple color. In time 
the entire mass of silver chloride is affected. 
121. The Magic Wand in Photography. Let us coat one 
side of a glass plate with silver chloride suspended in gelatine. 
We must be very careful to do this in a dark room,* otherwise 
the sunlight will act upon the silver chloride before we are 
ready. Lay a horseshoe on the plate and carry it into the 
sunlight for a minute. The light causes some of the chlorine 
to escape, but the silver remains behind with the rest of the 
silver chloride, darkening it. All of the plate was affected by 
the sun except the portion protected by the horseshoe, which 
does not allow light to reach the plate. If, now, the plate is 
carried back to the dark room and the horseshoe is removed, 
we shall see on the plate an image of the horseshoe. But we 
must not take this image into the light because the silver 
chloride which was protected by the horseshoe is still present 
and would be strongly affected by the least light, and asa 
result there would be no image of the horseshoe. 
But a photograph on glass, which must be carefully shielded 
from the light, would be neither pleasurable nor practical. 
If there were some way by which the unaffected silver chloride 
* That is, a room from which ordinary daylight is excluded.

could be totally removed, we could take the plate into any 
light without fear. To accomplish this, the unchanged silver 
chloride is got rid of by “ fixing”; that is, by washing off the 
unreduced silver chloride with a solution known as hypo. 
After a bath in the hypo the plate is cleansed in clear running 
water and left to dry. Such:a process gives a‘clear and per- 
manent picture on the plate.

containing a movable convex lens atone end and a screen at 
the opposite end. Light 
from the object to be 
photographed passes 
through the lens, falls 
upon the screen, and 
forms an image there. 
If we substitute for the 
® screen a plate or film 
coated with the silver 
chloride, the light falling 
upon the sensitive plate 
will change the silver chloride and form an image if we give 
a sufficiently long exposure to the light. But this exposure 
would be so long that it would be quite impracticable to give 
it, and so we must help the action of light by a chemical 
  Fic. 82.— A camera. 
process. Certain substances called “developers” separate 
the silver from the chlorine in silver chloride. Therefore; 
instead of giving an impracticable exposure, long enough 
to allow the light to complete its work on the silver chloride, 
we give an exposure just long enough to allow the light to 
start the chemical action on the silver chloride. Then the 
plate or film is placed in a developer, which quickly completes 
the liberation begun by the sunlight and: produces the image. 
Silver bromide is more easily acted upon by developers than
-P-A-G-E-129

silver chloride and is now generally used for plates and films. 
Silver bromide is precipitated in gelatine, with which it forms 
an emulsion. This emulsion is then spread over glass plates 
or films in a thin even coating. The sensitized surfaces are 
dried in dark rooms, and the plates and films are packed ready 
for sale. If you look ata plate or film in the light, you see 
the yellow, creamy film of the emulsion. As glass plates are 
heavy and inconvenient, celluloid films have almost entirely 
taken their place for outdoor work. 
If one of these plates or films coated with the silver bromide 
emulsion is exposed in the camera and then carried back into 
the dark room, one would expect to see an image. But we 
are much disappointed because the plate shows not the slight- 
est change in appearance. The change is there but the 
unaided eye cannot detect it. The developer must be used 
to bring out the hidden image. When the plate has been in 
the developer for a few seconds, the coating gradually darkens 
and the image slowly appears. When the image is fully de- 
veloped, the unchanged silver bromide is got rid of by fixing, 
the plates are washed, and the negative is ready for use. 
123. Light and Shade. Let us apply the above process to 
a real photograph. Suppose we wish to take the photograph 
of a man sitting in a chair in his library. If the man wore a 
gray coat, a black tie, and a white collar, these details must be 
faithfully represented in the photograph. How can the almost 
innumerable lights and shades be produced on the plate? 
The white collar would send through the lens the most light 
to the sensitive plate; hence the silver bromide on the plate 
would be most changed at the place where the lens formed an 
image of the collar. The gray coat would not send to the 
lens so much light as the white collar, hence the silver bromide 
would be less affected by the light from the coat than by that 
from the collar, and at the place where the lens produced an 
CL. GEN, SCI.—9 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 PHOTOGRAPHY 
image of the coat the silver bromide would not be changed so 
much as where the collar image is. The light from the face 
would produce a still different effect, since the light from the 
face is stronger than the light from the gray coat, but less 
than that from a white collar. The face in the image would 
show less changed silver bromide than the collar, but more 
than the coat, because the face is lighter than the coat, but 
not so light as the collar. Finally, the silver bromide would 
be least affected by the dark tie. The wall paper in the back- 
ground would affect the plate according to the brightness of 
the light which fell directly upon it and which reflected to the 
camera. When such a plate has been developed and fixed, 
as described in Section 121, we have the so-called negative 
(Fig. 83). The collar is very 
dark, the black tie and gray 
coat white, and the white tidy 
very dark. 
The lighter the object, such 
as tidy or collar, the more salt 
is changed, or, in other words, 
the greater the portion of the 
silver salt that is affected, and 
hence the darker the silver de- 
posit on the plate at that partic- 
ular spot. The plate shows all 
gradations of intensity — the 
tidy is dark, the black tie is 
light. The photograph is true as far as position, form, and 
expression are concerned, but the actual intensities are just 
reversed. How this plate can be transformed into a photo- 
graph true in every detail will be seen in the following Section. 
124. The Perfect Photograph. Bright objects, such as the 
sky or a white waist, change much of the silver bromide,     aN ae

    LIGHT AND DISEASE 131 
and hence appear dark on the negative. Dark objects, 
such as furniture or a black coat, change little of the bro- 
mide, and hence appear light on the negative. To obtain a 
true photograph, the negative is placed on a piece of sen- 
sitive photographic paper, or paper coated with a silver salt 
in the same manner as the plate and films. The combination 
is exposed to the light. The dark portions of the negative 
will act as obstructions to the passage of light, and but little 
light will pass through that part of the negative to the photo- 
graphic paper, and consequently ‘but little of the silver salt 
on the paper will be changed. On the other hand, the light 
portion of the negative will allow free and easy passage of 
the light rays, which will fall upon the photographic paper and 
will change much more of the 
silver. Thus it is that dark 
places in the negative produce 
or real photograph (Fig. 84), 
and that light places in the 
negative produce dark places 
in the positive; all intermediate 
grades are likewise represented 
with their proper gradations of 
intensity. 
If properly treated, a nega- 
tive remains good for years, 
and will serve for an indefinite 
number of positives or true photographs. 
125. Light and Disease. The far-reaching effect which 
light has upon some inanimate objects, such as photographic 
films and clothes, leads us to inquire into the relation which 
exists between light and living things. We know from daily 
observation that plants must have light in order to thrive 
  Fic. 84.— A positive or true photograph,

  132 PHOTOGRAPHY 
and grow. A healthy plant brought into a dark room soon 
loses its vigor and freshness, and becomes yellow and droop- 
ing. Plants do not all 
agree as to the amount 
of light they require, 
for some, like the violet 
and the arbutus, grow 
best in moderate light, 
while others, like the 
willows, need the 
strong, full beams of 
Fic, 85. —Stems and leaves of oxalis growing thesun. Butnearlyall 
toward the light, common plants, what- 
ever they are, sicken and die if deprived of sunlight for a long 
time. This is likewise true in the animal world. During long 
transportation, animals are sometimes necessarily corifined in 
dark cars, with the result that many deaths occur, even though 
the car is well aired and ventilated and the food supply 
good. Light and fresh air put color into pale cheeks, just as 
light and air transform sickly, yellowish plants into hardy 
green ones. Plenty of fresh air, light, and pure water are 
the watchwords against disease. 
In addition to the plants and animals which we see, there 
are many strange unseen ones floating in the atmosphere 
around us, lying in the dust of corner and closet, growing 
in the water we drink, and thronging decayed vegetable 
and animal matter. Every one knows that mildew and ver- 
min do damage in the home and in the field, but very few 
understand that, in addition to these visible enemies of 
man, there are swarms of invisible plants and animals some 
of which do far more damage, both directly and indirectly, 
than the seen and familiar enemies. All such very small 
plants and animals are known as microdrganisms. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  
  LIGHT AND DISEASE 133 
Not all microérganisms are harmful; some are our friends 
and are as helpful to us as are cultivated plants and domesti-— 
cated animals. Among the most important of the microor- 
ganisms are bacteria, which include among their number both 
friend and foe. In the household, bacteria are a fruitful 
source of trouble, but some of them are distinctly friends. 
The delicate flavor of butter and the sharp but pleasing taste 
of cheese are produced by bacteria. On the other hand, 
bacteria are the cause of many of the most dangerous diseases, 
such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, influenza, and la grippe. 
By careful observation and experimentation it has been 
shown conclusively that sunlight rapidly kills bacteria, and 
that it is only in dampness and darkness that bacteria thrive 
and multiply. Although sunlight is essential to the growth 
of most plants and animals, it retards and prevents the growth 
of bacteria. Dirt and dust exposed to the sunlight lose their 
living bacteria, while in damp cellars and dark corners the 
bacteria thrive, increasing steadily in number. For this rea- 
son our houses should: be kept light and airy; blinds should 
be raised, even if carpets do fade; it is better that carpets and 
furniture should fade than that disease-producing bacteria 
should find a permanent abode within our dwellings. Kitch- 
ens and pantries in particular should be thoroughly lighted. 
Bedclothes, rugs, and clothing should be exposed to the sun- 
light as frequently as possible; there is no better safeguard 
against bacterial disease than light. In a sick room sunlight 
is especially valuable, because it not only kills bacteria, but 
keeps the air dry, and new bacteria cannot get a start in a 
dry atmosphere.

COLOR 
126. The Rainbow. One of the most beautiful and well- 
known phenomena in nature is the rainbow, and from time 
immemorial it has been considered Jehovah’s signal to man- 
kind that the storm is over and that the sunshine will remain. 
Practically every one knows that a rainbow can be seen only 
when the sun’s rays shine upon a mist of tiny drops of water. 
It is these tiny drops which by their refraction and their scat- 
tering of light produce the rainbow in the heavens. 
The exquisite tints of the rainbow can be seen if we look 
at an object through a prism or chandelier crystal, and a very 
simple experiment enables us to produce on the wall of a 
room the exact colors of the rainbow in all their beauty. 
127. How to produce Rainbow Colors. Zhe Spectrum. 
If a beam of sunlight is admitted into a dark room through 
a narrow opening in the shade, and is allowed to fall upon 
a prism, as shown in 
Figure 86, a beautiful 
band of colors will appear 
on the opposite wall of 
the room. The ray of 
light which entered the 
Fic, 86.— White light is a mixture of lights of room as ordinary sun- rainbow colors, . 
light has not only been 
refracted and bent from its straight path, but it has been 
spread out into a band of colors similar to those of the rainbow. 
134 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  COLOR 135 
Whenever light passes through a prism or lens, it is dis- 
persed or separated into all the colors which it contains, and 
a band of colors produced in this way is called a spectrum. 
If we examine such a spectrum we find the following colors 
in order, each color imperceptibly fading into the next : violet. 
indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. 
128. Sunlight or White Light. White light or sunlight can 
be dispersed or separated into the primary colors or rainbow 
hues, as shown in the preceding Section.. What seems even 
more wonderful is that these spectral colors can be recom- 
bined so as to make white light. 
If a prism B (Fig. 87) exactly similar to A in every way is 
placed behind A in a reversed position, it will undo the 
dispersion of A, bending 
upward the seven different 
beams in such a way that 
they emerge together and 
produce a white spot on the a 
screen. Thus we see, from “4 B 
two simple experiments, that f 
all the colors of the rainbow Fe et ee o 
may be obtained from white 
light, and that these colors may be in turn recombined to 
produce white light. 
White light is not a simple light, but is composed of all the 
colors which appear in the rainbow. 
129. Color. If a piece of red glass is held in the path of 
the colored beam of light formed as in Section 127, all the 
colors on the wall will disappear except the red, and instead 
of a beautiful spectrum of all colors there will be seen the 
red color alone. The red glass does not allow the passage 
through it of any light except red light; all other colors are 
absorbed by the red glass and do not reach the eye. Only
-P-A-G-E-136
    136 COLOR 
the red ray passes through the red glass, reaches the eye, 
and produces a sensation of color. 
If a piece of blue glass is substituted for the red glass, the 
blue band remains on the wall, while all the other colors dis- 
appear. If both blue and red pieces of glass are held in the 
path of the beam, so that the light must pass through first 
one and then the other, the entire spectrum disappears and 
no color remains. The blue glass absorbs the various rays 
with the exception of the blue ones, and the red glass will 
not allow these blue rays to pass through it; hence no light 
is allowed passage to the eye. 
An emerald looks green because it freely transmits green, 
but absorbs the other colors of which ordinary daylight is 
_composed. A diamond appears white because it allows the 
passage through it of all the various rays; this is likewise 
true of water and window panes. 
Stained-glass windows owe their charm and beauty to the 
presence in the glass of various dyes and pigments which 
absorb in different amounts some colors from white light and 
transmit others. These pigments or dyes are added to the 
glass while it is in the molten state, and the beauty of a 
stained-glass window depends largely upon the richness and 
the delicacy of the pigments used. 
130. Reflected Light. Opague Objects. In Section 106 
we learned that most objects are visible to us because of the 
light diffusely reflected from them. A white object, such as 
a sheet of paper, a whitewashed fence, or a table cloth, absorbs 
little of the light which falls upon it, but reflects nearly all, 
thus producing the sensation of white. A red carpet absorbs 
the light rays incident upon it except the red oe and these 
it reflects to the eye. 
Any substance or object which reflects none of the rays 
which fall upon it, but absorbs all, appears black; no rays

HOW AND WHY COLORS CHANGE 137 
reach the eye, and there is an absence of any color sensation. 
Coal and tar and soot are good illustrations of objects which 
absorb all the light which falls upon them. 
131. How and Why Colors Change. Matching Colors. 
Most women prefer to shop in the morning and early after- 
noon when the sunlight illuminates shops and factories, and 
when gas and electricity do not throw their spell over colors. 
Practically all people know that ribbons and ties, trimmings 
and dresses, frequently look different at night from what they 
do in the daytime. It is not safe to match colors by artificial 
light; cloth which looks red by night may be almost purple 
by day. Indeed, the color of an object depends upon the 
color of the light which falls upon it. Strange sights are 
seen on the Fourth of July when variously colored fireworks 
are blazing. The child with a white blouse appears first red, 
then blue, then green, according as his powders burn red, blue, 
or green. The face of the child changes from its normal 
healthy hue to a brilliant red and then to ghastly shades. 
Suppose, for example, that a white hat is held at the red 
end of the spectrum or in any red light. The characteristics 
of white objects is their ability to reflect a// the various rays 
that fall upon them. Here, however, the only light which 
falls upon the white hat is red light, hence the only light 
which the hat has to reflect is red light and the hat conse- 
quently appears red. Similarly, if a white hat is placed ina 
blue light, it will reflect all the light which falls upon it, namely, 
blue light, and will appear blue. Ifa red hat is held in a red 
light, it is seen inits proper color. Ifa red hat is held in a blue 
light, it appears black ; it cannot reflect any of the blue light 
because that is all absorbed and there is no red light to reflect. 
A child wearing a green frock on Independence Day seems 
at night to be wearing a black frock, if standing near powders 
burning with red, blue, or violet light.

132. Pure, Simple Colors— Things as they Seem. To the 
eye white light appears a simple, single color. It reveals its 
compound nature to us only when passed through a prism, 
when it shows itself to be compounded of an infinite number 
of colors which Sir Isaac Newton grouped in seven divisions : 
violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. 
We naturally ask ourselves whether these colors which 
compose white light are themselves in turn compound? To 
answer that question, let us very carefully insert a second 
prism in the path of the rays which issue from the first prism, 
carefully barring out the remaining six kinds of rays. If the 
red light is compound, it will be broken up into its constit- 
uent parts and will form atypical spectrum of its own, just as 
white light did after its passage through a prism. But the red 
rays pass through the second prism, are refracted, and bent 
from this course, and no new colors appear, no new spectrum 
is formed. Evidently a ray of spectrum red is a simple 
color, not a compound 
color.

133. Colors not as they Seem—Compound Colors. If one 
half of a cardboard disk (Fig. 88) is painted green, and the other 
half violet, and the disk is slipped upon a toy top, and spun rap- 
idly, the rotating disk will appear blue; if red and green are
-P-A-G-E-139
    THE ESSENTIAL COLORS 139 
used in the same way instead of green and violet, the rotating 
disk will appear yellow. A combination of red and yellow 
will give orange. The colors formed in this way do not appear 
to the eye different from the spectrum colors, but they are 
actually very different. The spectrum colors, as we saw in 
the preceding Section, are pure, simple colors, while the colors 
formed from the rotating disk are in reality compounded of 
several totally different rays, although in appearance the 
resulting colors are pure and simple. 
If it were not that colors can be compounded, we should 
be limited in hue and shade to the seven spectral colors; the 
wealth and beauty of color in nature, art, and commerce would 
be unknown; the flowers with their thousands of hues would 
have a poverty of color undreamed of; art would lose its 
magenta, its lilac, its olive, its lavender, and would have to 
work its wonders with the spectral colors alone. By com- 
pounding various colors in different proportions, new colors 
can be formed to give freshness and variety. If one third of 
the rotating disk is painted blue, and the remainder white, the 
result is lavender ; if fifteen parts of white, four parts of red, 
and one part of blue are arranged on the disk, the result is 
lilac. Olive is obtained from a combination of two parts green, 
one part red, and one part black; and the soft rich shades of 
brown are all due to different mixtures of black, red, orange, 
or yellow. 
134. The Essential Colors. Strange and unexpected facts 
await us at every turn in science! If the rotating cardboard 
disk (Fig. 88) is painted one third red, one third green, and 
one third blue, the resulting color is white. While the mix- 
ture of the spectral colors produces white, it is not neces- 
sary to have all of the spectral colors in order to obtain 
white ; because a mixture of the following colors alone, red, 
green, and blue, will give white. Moreover, by the mixture of
-P-A-G-E-140
  
  140 COLOR 
these three colors in proper proportions, any-color of the 
spectrum, such as yellow or indigo or orange, may be ob- 
tained. The three spectral colors, red, green, and blue, are 
called primary or essential hues, because all known tints of 
color may be produced by the careful blending of blue, green, 
and red in’ the proper proportions; for example, purple is 
obtained by the blending of red and blue, and orange by the 
blending of red and yellow. 
135. Color Blindness. The nerve fibers of the eye which 
carry the sensation of color to the brain are particularly sensi- 
tive to the primary colors—red, green, blue. Indeed, all 
color sensations are produced by the stimulation of three sets 
of nerves which are sensitive to the primary colors. If one 
sees purple, it is because the optic nerves sensitive to red 
and blue (purple equals red plus blue) have carried their sep- 
arate messages to the brain, and the blending of the two dis- 
tinct messages in the brain has given the sensation of purple. 
If a red rose is seen, it is because the optic nerves sensitive 
to red have been stimulated and have carried the message to 
the brain. 
A snowy field stimulates equally all three sets of optic 
nerves — the red, the green, and the blue. Lavender, which 
is one part blue and three parts white, would stimulate all 
three sets of nerves, but with a maximum of stimulation for 
the blue. Equal stimulation of the three sets would give the 
impression of white. 
A color-blind person has some defect in one or more of the 
three sets of nerves which carry the color message to the brain. 
Suppose the nerve fibers responsible for carrying the red are 
totally defective. If such a person views a yellow flower, he 
will see it as a green flower. Yellow contains both red and 
green, and hence both the red and green nerve fibers should be 
stimulated, but the red nerve fibers are defective and do not
-P-A-G-E-141
  COLOR BLINDNESS 141 
respond, the green nerve fibers alone being stimulated, and 
the brain therefore interprets green. 
A well-known author gives an amusing incident of a dinner 
party, at which the host offered stewed tomato for apple 
sauce. What color nerves were defective in the case of the 
host? 
In some employments color blindness in an employee would 
be fatal to many lives. Engineers and pilots govern the di- 
rection and speed of trains and boats largely by the colored 
signals which flash out in the night’s darkness or move in the 
day’s bright light, and any mistake in the reading of color 
signals would imperil the lives of travelers. For this reason 
a rigid test in color is given to all persons seeking such em- 
ployment, and the ability to match ribbons and yarns of all 
| ordinary hues is an unvarying requirement for efficiency.

  CHAPTER XIV 
HEAT AND LIGHT AS COMPANIONS 
“The night has a thousand eyes, 
And the day but one; 
Yet the light of the bright world dies 
With the dying sun.” 
136. Most bodies which glow and give out light are hot; the 
stove which glows with a warm red is hot and fiery ; smolder- 
ing wood is black and lifeless; glowing coals are far hotter 
than black ones. The stained-glass window softens and mel- 
lows the bright light of the sun, but it also shuts out some 
of the warmth of the sun’s rays; the shady side of the street 
spares our eyes the intense glare of the sun, but may chill us 
by the absence of heat. Our illumination, whether it be oil 
lamp or gas jet or electric light, carries with it heat; indeed, 
so much heat that we refrain from making a light on a warm 
summer’s night because of the heat which it unavoidably fur- 
nishes. 
137. Red a Warm Color. We have seen that heat and 
light usually go hand in hand. In summer we lower the 
shades and close the blinds in order to keep the house cool, 
because the exclusion of light means the exclusion of some 
heat; in winter we open the blinds and raise the shades in 
order that the sun may stream into the room and flood it with 
light and warmth. The heat of the sun and the light of the 
sun seem boon companions. 
We can show that when light passes through a prism and 
is refracted, forming a spectrum, as in Section 127, it is accom- 
142
-P-A-G-E-143
THE ENERGY OF THE SUN 143 
panied by heat. If we hold a sensitive thermometer in the 
violet end of the spectrum so that the violet rays fall upon the 
bulb, the reading of the mercury will be practically the same as 
when the thermometer is held in any dark part of the room; if, 
however, the thermometer is slowly moved toward the red end 
of the spectrum, a change occurs and the mercury rises slowly 
but steadily, showing that heat rays are present at the red 
end of the spectrum. This agrees with the popular notion, 
formed independently of science, which calls the reds the 
warm colors. Every one of us associates red with warmth; 
in the summer red is rarely worn, it looks hot; but in winter 
red is one of the most pleasing colors because of the sense of 
warmth and cheer it brings. 
All light rays are accompanied by a small amount of heat, 
but the red rays carry the most. 
What seems perhaps the most unexpected thing, is that 
the temperature, as indicated by a sen- 
sitive thermometer, continues to rise if 
the thermometer is moved just beyond 
the red light of the spectrum. There 
actually seems to be more heat beyond 
the red than in the red, but if the 
thermometer is moved too far away, 
the temperature again falls. Later 
we shall see what this means. 
138. The Energy of the Sun. It 
is difficult to tell how much of the 
energy of the sun is light and how 
much is heat, but it is easy to deter- p46. 94, —The energy of the 
mine the combined effect of heat and sun can be measured in heat light. units. 
Suppose we allow the sun’s rays to fall perpendicularly 
upon a metal cylinder coated with lampblack and filled with 
   
-P-A-G-E-144
144 “HEAT AND LIGHT AS COMPANIONS 
a known quantity of water (Fig. 89); at the expiration of a 
few hours the temperature of the water will be considerably 
higher. Lampblack is a good absorber of heat, and it is used 
as a coating in order that all the light rays which fall upon 
the cylinder may be absorbed and none lost by reflection. 
Light and heat rays fall upon the lampblack, pass through 
the cylinder, and heat the water. We know that the red 
light rays have the largest share toward heating the water, 
because if the cylinder is surrounded by blue glass which ab- 
sorbs the red rays and prevents their passage into the water, 
the temperature of the water begins to fall. That the other 
light rays have a small share would have been clear from the 
preceding Section. 
All the energy of the sunshine which falls upon the cylin- 
der, both as heat and as light, is absorbed in the form of heat, 
and the total amount of this energy can be calculated from 
the increase in the temperature of the water. The energy 
which heated the water would have passed onward to the sur- 
face of the earth if its path had not been obstructed by the 
cylinder of water; and we can be sure that the energy which 
entered the water and changed its temperature would ordi- 
narily have heated an equal area of the earth’s surface; and 
from this, we can calculate the energy falling upon the entire 
surface of the earth during any one day. 
Computations based upon this experiment show that 
the earth receives daily from the sun the equivalent of 
341,000,000,000 horse power—an amount inconceivable 
to the human mind. 
Professor Young gives a striking picture of what this 
energy of the suncoulddo. A solid column of ice 93,000,000 
miles long and 2} miles in diameter could be melted in a 
single second if the sun could concentrate its entire power 
on the ice.
-P-A-G-E-145
  HOW LIGHT AND HEAT TRAVEL 145 
While the amount of energy received daily from the sun 
by the earth is actually enormous, it is small in comparison 
with the whole amount given out by the sun to the numerous 
heavenly bodies which make up the universe. In fact, of the 
entire outflow of heat and light, the earth receives only one 
part in two thousand million, and this is a very small portion 
indeed. 
139. How Light and Heat Travel from the Sun to Us. 
Astronomers tell us that the sun — the chief source of heat and 
light — is 93,000,000 miles away from us; that is, so far distant 
that the fastest express train would require about 176 years to 
reach the sun. How do heat and light travel through this 
vast abyss of space? 
A quiet pool and a pebble will help to make it clear to us. 
If we throw a pebble into a quiet pool (Fig. 90), waves or rip- 
  Fic. 90.— Waves formed by a pebble, 
ples form and spread out in all directions, gradually dying out 
as they become more and more distant from the pebble. It 
is a strange fact that while we see the ripple moving farther 
and farther away, the particles of water are themselves not 
moving outward and away, but are merely bobbing up and 
down, or are vibrating. If you wish to be sure of this, throw 
the pebble near a spot where a chip lies quiet on the smooth 
pond. After the waves form, the chip rides up and down 
with the water, but does not move outward; if the water it-

-P-A-G-E-146
    146 HEAT AND LIGHT AS COMPANIONS 
self were moving outward, it would carry the chip with it, 
but the water has no forward motion, and hence the chip as- 
sumes the only motion possessed by the water, that is, an 
up-and-down motion. Perhaps a more simple illustration is 
the appearance of a wheat field or a lawn ona windy day; the 
wind sweeps over the grass, producing in the grass a wave like 
the water waves of the ocean, but the blades of grass do not 
‘move from their accustomed place in the ground, held fast 
as they are by their roots. 
If a pebble is thrown into a quiet pool, it creates ripples or 
waves which spread outward in all directions, but which soon 
die out, leaving the pool again placid and undisturbed. If 
now we could quickly withdraw the pebble from the pool, the 
water would again be disturbed and waves would form. If 
the pebble were attached toa string so that it could be dropped 
into the water and withdrawn at regular intervals, the waves 
would never have a chance to disappear, because there would 
always be a regularly timed definite disturbance of the water. 
Learned men tell us that all hot bodies and all luminous bodies 
are composed of tiny particles, called molecules, which move 
unceasingly back and forth with great speed. In Section 95 
we saw that the molecules of all substances move un- 
ceasingly ; their speed, however, is not so great, nor are their 
motions so regularly timed as are those of the heat-giving and 
the light-giving particles. As the particles of the hot and 
luminous bodies vibrate with great speed and force they 
violently disturb the medium around them, and produce a 
series of waves similar to those produced in the water by 
the pebble. If, however, a pebble is thrown into the water 
very gently, the disturbance is slight, sometimes too slight to 
throw the water into waves; in the same way objects whose 
molecules are in a state of gentle motion do not produce 
light.
-P-A-G-E-147
  HOW HEAT AND LIGHT DIFFER 147 
The particles of heat-giving and light-giving bodies are in 
a state of rapid vibration, and thereby disturb the sur- 
rounding medium, which transmits or conveys the disturb- 
ance to the earth or to other objects by a train of waves. 
When these waves reach their destination, the sensation of 
light or heat is produced. 
We see the water waves, but we can never see with the eye 
the heat and light waves which roll in to us from that far- 
distant source, the sun. We can be sure of them only through 
their effect on our bodies, and by the visible work they do. 
140. How Heat and Light Differ. If heat and light are 
alike due to the regular, rapid motion of the particles of a 
body, and are similarly conveyed by waves, how is it, then, 
that heat and light are apparently so different? 
Light and heat differ as much as the short, choppy waves 
of the ocean and the slow, long swell of the ocean, but not ’ 
more so. The sailor handles his boat in one way in a choppy 
sea and in a different way in a rolling sea, for he knows 
that these two kinds of waves act dissimilarly. The long, 
slow swell of the ocean would correspond with the longer, 
slower waves which travel out from the sun, and which on 
reaching us are interpreted as heat. The shorter, more fre- 
quent waves of the ocean would typify the short, rapid waves 
which leave the sun, and which on reaching us are interpreted 
as light.

  CHAPTER: XN: 
ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING 
141. We seldom consider what life would be without our 
wonderful methods of illumination which turn night into day, 
and prolong the hours of work and pleasure. Yet it was not 
until the nineteenth century that the marvelous change. was 
made from the short-lived candle to the more enduring oil lamp. 
Before the coming of the lamp, even in large cities like Paris, 
the only artificial light to guide the belated traveler at night 
was the candle required to be kept burning in an occasional 
window. 
With the invention of the kerosene lamp came more effi- 
cient lighting of home and street, and with the advent of gas 
and electricity came a light so effective that the hours of busi- 
ness, manufacture, and pleasure could be extended far beyond 
the setting of the sun. 
The production of light by candle, oil, and gas will be con- 
sidered in the following paragraphs, while illumination by 
electricity will be reserved for a later Chapter. 
142. The Candle. Candles were originally made by dipping 
a wick into melting tallow, withdrawing it, allowing the ad- 
hered tallow to harden, and repeating the dipping until a sat- 
isfactory thickness was obtained. The more modern method 
consists in pouring a-fatty preparation into a mold, at the cen- 
ter of which a wick has been placed. 
The wick, when lighted, burns for a brief interval with a 
faint, uncertain light; almost immediately, however, the inten- 
148
-P-A-G-E-149
OIL 149 
sity of the light increases and the illumination remains good 
as long as the candle lasts. The heat of the burning tallow 
melts more of the tallow near it, and this liquid fat is quickly 
sucked up into the burning wick. The heat of the flame is 
sufficient to change most of this liquid into a gas, that is, to 
vaporize the liquid, and furthermore to set fire to the gas thus 
formed. These heated gases burn with a bright yellow flame. 
143. The Oil Lamp. The simple candle of our ancestors 
was now replaced by the oil lamp, which gave a brighter, 
steadier, and more permanent illumination. The principle of 
the lamp is similar to that of the candle, except that the wick 
is saturated with kerosene or oil rather than with fat. The 
heat from the burning wick is sufficient to change the oil into 
a gas and then to set fire to the gas. .By placing a chimney 
over the burning wick, a constant and uniform draught of 
air is maintained around the blazing gases, and hence a 
steady, unflickering light is obtained. Gases and carbon 
particles are set free by the burning wick. In order that 
the gases may burn and the solid particle glow, a plentiful 
supply of oxygen is necessary. If the quantity of air is in- 
sufficient, the carbon particles remain unburned and form 
soot. A lamp “smokes” when the air which reaches the 
wick is insufficient to burn the rapidly formed carbon par- 
ticles; this explains the danger of turning a lamp wick 
too high and producing more carbon particles than can be 
oxidized by the air admitted through the lamp chimney. 
One great disadvantage of oil lamps and oil stoves is that 
they cannot be carried safely from place to place. It is al- 
most impossible to carry a lamp without spilling the oil. The 
flame soon spreads from the wick to the overflowing oil and 
in consequence the lamp blazes and an explosion may result. 
Candles, on the other hand, are safe from explosion; the 
dripping grease is unpleasant but not dangerous.
-P-A-G-E-150

150 ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING 
The illumination from a shaded oil lamp is soft and agree. 
able, but the trimming of the wicks, the refilling of bowls, ’ 
and the cleaning of chimneys require time and labor. For 
this reason, the introduction of gas met with wide-spread 
success. The illumination from an ordinary gas jet is 
stronger than that from an ordinary lamp, and the stronger 
illumination added to the greater convenience has made gas 
a very popular source of light. 
144. Gas Burners and Gas Mantles. For a long time, the 
only gas flame used was that in which the luminosity resulted 
in heating particles of carbon to incandescence. Recently, 
however, that has been widely replaced by use of a Bunsen 
flame upon an incandescent mantle, such as the Welsbach. 
The principle of the incandescent mantle is very simple. 
When certain substances, such as thorium and cerium, are 
heated, they do not melt or vaporize, but glow with an intense 
bright light. Welsbach made use of this fact to secure a 
burner in which the illumination depends upon the glowing 
of an incandescent, solid mantle, rather than upon the blaz- 
ing of a burning gas. He made a cylindrical mantle of thin 
fabric, and then soaked it in a solution of thorium and cerium 
until it became saturated with the chemical. The mantle 
thus impregnated with thorium and cerium is placed on the 
gas jet, but before the gas is turned on, a lighted match is 
held to the mantle in order to burn away the thin fabric. 
After the fabric has been burned away, there remains a coarse 
gauze mantle of the desired chemicals. If now the gas cock 
is opened, the escaping gas is ignited, the heat of the flame 
will raise the mantle to incandescence and will produce a 
brilliant light. A very small amount’of burning gas is suffi- 
cient to raise the mantle to incandescence, and hence, by the 
use of a mantle, intense light is secured at little cost. The 
mantle saves us gas, because the cock is usually “turned on  
-P-A-G-E-151
  GAS FOR COOKING I5r 
full” whether we use a plain burner or a mantle burner. 
But, nevertheless, gas is saved, because when the mantle is 
adjusted to the gas jet, the pressure of the gas is lessened by 
a mechanical device and hence less gas escapes and burns. 
By actual experiment, it has been found that an ordinary 
burner consumes about five times as much gas per candle 
power as the best incandescent burner, and hence is about 
five times as expensive. One objection to the mantles is their 
tendency to break. But if the mantles are carefully adjusted 
on the burner and are not roughly jarred in use, they last 
many months; and since the best quality cost only twenty- 
five cents, the expense of renewing the mantles is slight. 
i 145. Gas for Cooking. Ifa cold object is held in the bright 
flame of an ordinary gas jet, it becomes covered with soot, or 
particles of unburned carbon. Although the flame is sur- 
rounded by air, the central portion of it does not receive suf- 
ficient oxygen to burn up the numerous carbon particles con- 
stantly thrown off by the burning gas, and hence many carbon 
particles remain in the flame as glowing, incandescent masses. 
That some unburned carbon is present in a flame is shown by 
the fact that whenever a cold object is held in the flame, 
it becomes “smoked” or covered with soot. If enough air 
were supplicd to the flame to burn up the carbon as fast as 
it was set free, there would be no deposition of soot on ob- 
jects held over the flame or in it, because the carbon would 
be transformed into gaseous matter. 
Unburned carbon would be objectionable in cooking stoves 
where utensils are constantly in contact with the flame, and 
for this reason cooking stoves are provided with an arrange- 
ment by means of which additional air is supplied to the 
burning gas in quantities adequate to insure complete com- 
bustion of the rapidly formed carbon particles. An opening 
is made in the tube through which gas passes to the burner,
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING 
and as the gas moves past this opening, it carries with it a 
draft of air. These openings are visible on all gas stoves, 
and should be kept clean and free of clogging, in order to 
insure complete combustion. So long as the supply of air 
is sufficient, the flame burns with a dull blue color, but when 
the supply falls below that needed for complete burning of 
the carbon, the blue color disappears, and a yellow flame takes 
its place, and with the yellow flame the deposition of soot is 
inevitable. 
146. By-products of Coal Gas. Many important products 
besides illuminating gas are obtained from the distillation of 
soft coal. Ammonia is made from the liquids which collect in 
the condensers; anilin, the source of exquisite dyes, is made 
from the thick, tarry distillate, and coke is the residue left in 
the clay retorts. The coal tar yields not only anilin, but also 
carbolic acid and naphthalene, both of which are commercially 
valuable, the former as a widely used disinfectant, and the 
latter as a popular moth preventive. 
From a ton of good gas-producing coal can be obtained 
about 10,000 cubic feet of illuminating gas, and as by-prod- 
ucts 6 pounds of ammonia, 12 gallons of coal tar, and 1300 
pounds of coke. 
147. Natural Gas. Animal and vegetable matter buried 
in the depth of the earth sometimes undergoes natural distil- 
lation, and as a result gas is formed. The gas produced in 
this way is called natural gas. It is a cheap source of illu- 
mination, but is found in relatively few localities and only in 
limited quantity. 
148. Acetylene. In 1892 it was discovered that lime and 
coal fused together in the intense heat of the electric furnace 
formed a crystalline, metallic-looking substance called calcium 
carbide. As a result of that discovery, this substance was 
soon made on a large scale and sold at a moderate price.
-P-A-G-E-153
ACETYLENE 153 
The cheapness of calcium carbide has made it possible for the 
isolated farmhouse to discard oil lamps and to have a private gas 
system. When the hard, gray crystals of calcium carbide are 
put in water, they give off acetylene, a colorless gas which burns 
with a brilliant white flame. If bits of calcium carbide are 
dropped into a test tube containing water, bubbles of gas will be 
seen to form and escape into the air, and the escaping gas may 
be ignited by a burning match held near the mouth of the 
test tube. When chemical action between the water and car- 
bide has ceased, and gas bubbles have stopped forming, slaked 
lime is all that is left of the dark gray crystals which were 
put into the water. 
When calcium carbide is used as a source of illumination, 
the crystals are mechanically dropped into a tank containing 
water, and the gas generated is automatically collected in a 
small sliding tank, whence it passes through pipes to the va- 
rious rooms. The-slaked lime, formed while the gas was gen- 
erated, collects at the bottom of the tanks and is removed 
from time to time. 
The cost of an acetylene generator is about $50 for a small 
house, and the cost of maintenance is not more than that of 
lamps. The generator does not require filling oftener than 
once a week, and the labor is less than that required for oil 
lamps. In a house in which there were twenty burners, the 
tanks were filled with water and carbide but once a fortnight. 
Acetylene is seldom used in large cities, but it is very widely 
used in small communities and is particularly convenient in 
more or less remote summer residences. 
Electric Lights. The most recent and the most convenient 
lighting is that obtained by electricity. A fine, hairlike fila- 
ment within a glass bulb is raised to incandescence by the 
heat of an electric current. This form of illumination will be 
considered in connection with electricity.

149. Labor-saving Devices. To primitive man belonged 
more especially the arduous tasks of the out-of-door life: the 
clearing of paths through 
the wilderness; the haul-

ing up of the hard soil of 
barren fields into soft loam 
ready to receive the seed ; 
the harvesting of the ripe 
grain, etc. 
The more _ intelligent 
Fi. gt.— Prying a stone out of the ground, TaCeS among men soon 
learned to help them- 
selves in these tasks. Forexample, our ancestors in the field 
soon learned to pry stones out of the ground (Fig. 91) 
rather than to undertake the almost impossible task of lifting 
them out of the earth in which they were embedded ; to swing 
fallen trees away from a path by means of rope attached to 
one end rather than to attempt to remove them single-handed ; 
to pitch hay rather than to lift it; to clear a field with a rake 
rather than with the hands; to carry heavy loads in wheelbar- 
rows (Fig. 92) rather than on the shoulders; to roll barrels 
up a plank (Fig. 93) and to raise weights by ropes. Inevery 
case, whether in the lifting of stones, or the felling of trees, 
or the transportation of heavy weights, or the digging of 
the ground, man used his brain in the invention of mechanical 
154 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  WHEN DO WE WORK? 155 
devices which would relieve muscular strain and lighten 
physical labor. 
If all mankind had depended upon physical strength only, 
the world to-day would be 
in the condition prevalent 
in parts of Africa, Asia, 
and South America, 
where the natives loosen 
the soil with their hands 
or with crude implements 
(Fig. 94), and transport 
huge weights on their 
shoulders and heads. 
Any mechanical device 
(Figs. 95 and 96), whereby 
man’s work can be more 
conveniently done, is called 
amachine; the machine it- 
self never does any work — 
  Fic, 92, — The wheelbarrow lightens labor. 
it merely enables man to use his own efforts to better advantage. 
150. When do we Work? Whenever, as a result of effort or 
  FIG. 93.— Rolling barrels up a plank, force, an “object “is 
moved, work is done. 
If you lift a knapsack 
from the floor to the 
table, you do work be- 
cause you use force 
.and move the knap- 
sack through a distance 
equal to the height of 
the table. If the ciccek were twice as heavy, you would 
exert twice as much force to raise it to the same height, and 
hence you would do double the work. If you raised the 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
156 MAN'S WAY OF HELPING HIMSELF 
knapsack twice the distance, — say to your shoulders instead 
of to the level of the table, — you would do twice the work, 
because while you would 
exert the same force you 
would continue it through 
double the distance. 
Lifting heavy weights 
through great distances is 
not the only way in which 
work is done. Painting, 
chopping wood, hammer- 
ing, plowing, washing, 
scrubbing, sewing, are all 
forms of work. In painting, 
the moving brush spreads 
paint over a surface; in 
chopping wood, the descending ax cleaves the wood asunder; in 
scrubbing, the wet mop rubbed over the floor carries dirt away ; 
in every conceivable form of work, force and motion occur. 
A man does work when he walks, a woman does work 
when she rocks in a chair —although here the work is less 
than in walking. On a windy day the work done in walking 
is greater than normal. The wind resists our progress, and 
we must exert more force in order to cover the same distance. 
Walking through a plowed or rough field is much more tiring 
than to walk on a smooth road, because, while the distance 
covered may be the same, the effort put forth is greater, and 
hence more work is done. Always the greater the resistance 
encountered, the greater the force required, and hence the 
greater the work done. 
The work done by a boy who raises a 5-pound knapsack to 
his shoulder would be 5 x 4, or 20, providing his shoulders 
were 4 feet from the ground.

The amount of work done depends upon the force used 
and the distance covered (sometimes called displacement), and 
hence we can say that 
Work = force multiplied by distance, * 
or W=fxd. 
151. Machines. A glance into 
our machine shops, our factories, 
and even our homes shows how 
widespread is the use of complex 
machinery. But all machines, how- 
ever complicated in appearance, are 
in reality but modifications and com- 
binations of one or more of four 
simple machines devised long ago 
by our remote ancestors. These 
simple devices are known to-day, as 
(1) the lever, represented by a crow- 
bar, a pitchfork; (2) the inclined 
plane, represented by the plank 
upon which barrels are rolled into a 
wagon ; (3) the pulley, represented 
by almost any contrivance for the 
raising of furniture to upper stories ; 
(4) the wheel and axle, represented 
by cogwheels and coffee grinders. 
  FIG. 95.— Primitive method of 
grinding corn. 
Suppose a 600-pound bowlder which is embedded in the 
ground is needed for the tower of a building. The problem 
of the builder is to get the heavy bowlder out of the ground, 
to load it on a wagon for transportation, and finally to raise 
it to the tower. Obviously, he cannot do this alone; the 
greatest amount of force of which he is capable would not 
suffice to accomplish any one of these tasks. How then does

he help himself and perform the impossible? Simply, by 
the use of some of the machine types mentioned above, illus- 
trations of which are 
known in a general way to 
every schoolboy. The very 
knife with which a stick is 
whittled is a machine. 
152. The Lever. Balance 
a foot rule, containing a 
hole at its middle point 7 
as shown in Figure 97. If 
now a weight of 1 pound 
is suspended from the bar 
at some point, say 12, the 
balance is disturbed, and 
the bar swings about the 
point F as acenter. The 
balance can be regained by suspending an equivalent weight at 
the opposite end of the bar, or by applying a 2-pound weight 
at a point 3 inches to the left of # In the latter casea force 
of 1 pound actually balances a force of 2 pounds, but the 
1-pound weight is twice as far from the point of suspension as 
is the 2-pound weight. The small weight makes up in dis- 
tance what it lacks in -CeZ¢aeo— 
magnitude. a 
Such an arrange- 
ment of a rod or bar is 
called alever. Inany 
form of lever there are 
only three things to be 
considered: the point 
where the weight rests, the point where the force acts, and 
the point called the fulcrum about which the rod rotates. 
  FIG. 96.— Separating rice grains by flailing. 
       
Fic, 97.— The principle of the lever.
-P-A-G-E-159
APPLICATIONS OF THE LEVER 159 
The distance from the force to the fulcrum is called the 
force arm. The distance from the weight to the fulcrum is 
called the weight arm; and it is a law of levers, as well as of 
all other machines, that the force multiplied by the length of 
the force arm must equal the weight multiplied by the length 
of the weight arm. 
Force x force arm = weight x weight arm. 
A force of 1 pound at a distance of 6, or with a force arm 6, 
will balance a weight of 2 pounds with a weight arm 3; that is, 
PCO @ x 35 
Similarly a force of 10 pounds may be made to sustain a 
weight of 100 pounds, providing the force arm is 10 times 
longer than the weight arm; and a force arm of 800 pounds, 
at a distance of 10 feet from the fulcrum, may be made to 
sustain a weight of 8000 pounds, providing the weight is 1 foot 
from the fulcrum. 
153. Applications of the Lever. By means of a lever, a 600- 
pound bowlder can be easily pried out of the ground. Let 
the lever, any strong metal bar, be supported on a stone which 
serves as fulcrum; then if a man exerts his force at the end of 
the rod somewhat as in Figure gt (p. 154), the force arm will be 
the distance from the stone or fulcrum to the end of the bar, 
and the weight arm will be the distance from the fulcrum to the 
bowlder itself. The man pushes down with a force of 100 
pounds, but with that amount succeeds in prying up the 600- 
pound bowlder. If, however, you look carefully, you will see 
that the force arm is 6 timés as long.as the weight arm, so 
that the smaller force is compensated for by the greater dis- 
tance through which it acts. 
At first sight it seems as though the man’s work were done 
for him by the machine. But this is not so. The man must  
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 MAN'S WAY OF HELPING HIMSELF 
lower his end of the lever 3 feet in order to raise the bowlder 
6 inches out of the ground. © He does not at any time exert a 
large force, but he accomplishes his purpose by exerting a 
small force continuously through a, correspondingly greater 
distance. He finds it easier to exert a force of 100 pounds con- 
tinuously until his end has moved 3 feet rather than to exert 
a force of 600 pounds on the bowlder and move it 6 inches. 
By the time the stone has been raised the man has done as 
much work as though the stone had been raised directly, but 
his inability to put forth sufficient muscular force to raise 
the bowlder directly would have rendered impossible a result 
which was easily accomplished when through the medium 
of the lever he could extend his small force through greater’ 
distance. 
f- 154. The Wheelbarrow as a Lever. The principle of the 
“ lever is always the same; but the relative position of the im- 
portant points may vary. 
For example, the fulcrum 
is sometimes at one end, 
the force at the opposite 
end, and the weight to be 
lifted between them. 
Suspend a stick with a 
hole at its center as in

tance of 1 foot from the 
fulcrum, supporting the load by means of a spring balance 2 
feet from the fulcrum. The pointer on the spring balance 
shows that the force required to balance the 4-pound load is 
but 2 pounds. 
The force is 2 feet from the fulcrum, and the weight (4) 
is 1 foot from the fulcrum, so that 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
THE WHEELBARROW AS A LEVER 161 
Force x distance = Weight x distance, 
or Bie oiesiA sens 
Move the 4-pound weight so that it is very near the ful- 
crum, say but 6 inches from 
it; then the spring balance 
registers a force only one 
fourth as great as the weight 
which it suspends. Inother 
words a force of 1 at a dis- 
tance of 24 inches (2 feet) is 
equivalent to a force of 4 at 
a distance of 6 inches. 
One of the most useful / 
levers of this type is the 
wheelbarrow (Fig. 99). The 
fulcrum is at the wheel, the 
force is at the handles, the weight is on the wheelbarrow. 
If the load is halfway from the fulcrum to the man’s hands, 
the man will have to lift 
with a force equal to 
one half the load. If 
the load is one fourth as 
far from the fulcrum as 
the man’s hands, he will 
need to lift with a force 
only one fourth as great 
as that of the load. 
This shows that in 
loading a wheelbarrow, 
it is important to ar- 
range the load as near

155. The Inclined Plane. A man wishes to load the 600- 
pound bowlder on a wagon, and proceeds to do it by means 
of a plank, asin Figure 93. Such an arrangement is called 
an inclined plane. 
The advantage of an inclined plane can be seen by the 
following experiment. Select a smooth board 4 feet long 
and prop it so that the end A (Fig. ro4) is 1 foot above the 
level of the table; the length of the incline is then 4 times 
as great as its height. Fasten 
a metal roller to a spring bal- 
ance and observe its weight. 
Then pull the roller uniformly 
upward along the plank and 
notice what the pull is on the 
. balance, being careful always to 
hold the balance parallel to the 
incline. 
When the roller is raised

roller weighs 12, a force of 3 suffices to raise it to the height

  APPLICATION 163 
A along the incline; but the smaller force must be applied 
throughout the entire length of the incline. In many cases, 
it is preferable to exert a 
force of 30 pounds, for ex- 
ample, over the distance 
CA than a force of 120 
pounds over the shorter 
distance BA. 
Prop the board so that 
the end 4 is 2 feet above 
the table level; that is, ar- 
range the inclined plane in 
such a way that its length 
is twice as great as its aa e 
height. In that case the Fic. 103.— Primitive man tried to lighten his 
steady pull on the balance task by balancing his burden. 
will be one half the weight of the roller; or a force of 6 
pounds will suffice to raise the 12-pound roller. 
The steeper the incline, the more force necessary to raise a 
weight; whereas if the incline is small, the necessary lifting 
force is greatly reduced. 
On an inclined plane whose 
length is ten times its 
height, the lifting force is 
reduced to one tenth the 
weight of the load. The 
advantage of an incline de- 
pends upon the relative

length to the height. 
156. Application. By the use of an inclined plank a strong 
man can load the 600-pound bowlder on a wagon. Suppose 
     
-P-A-G-E-164
    164. MAN'S WAY OF HELPING HIMSELF 
the floor of the wagon is 2 feet above the ground, then if a 
6-foot plank is used, 200 pounds of force will suffice to raise 
the bowlder; but the man will have to push with this force 
against the bowlder while it moves over the entire length 
of the plank. 
Since work is equal to force multiplied by distance, the 
man has done work represented by 200 x 6, or 1200. This 
is exactly the amount of work which would have been neces- 
sary to raise the bowlder directly. A man of even enormous 
strength could not lift such a weight (600 lb.) even an inch 
directly, but a strong man can furnish the smaller force (200) 
over a distance of 6 feet; hence, while the machine does 
not lessen the total amount of work required of a man, it 
creates a new distribution of work and makes possible, and 
even easy, results which otherwise would be impossible by 
human agency. 
157. Railroads and Highways. The problem of the incline 
is an important one to engineers who have under their direc- 
tion the construction of our highways and the laying of our 
railroad tracks. It requires tremendous force to pull a load 
  Fic. 105.—A well-graded railroad bed.
-P-A-G-E-165
RAILROADS AND HIGHWAYS 165 
up grade, and most of us are familiar with the struggling 
horse and the puffing locomotive. For this reason engineers, 
wherever possible, level down the steep places, and reduce 
the strain as far as possible. 
The slope of the road is called its grade, and the grade 
itself is simply the number of feet the hill rises per mile. A 
  Fia. 106, — A long, gradual ascent is better than a shorter, steeper one. 
road a mile long (5280 feet) has a grade of 132 if the crest of 
the hill is 132 feet above the level at which the road started. 
In such an incline, the ratio of length to height is 5280+ 132, 
or 40; and hence in order to pull a train of cars to the summit, 
the engine would need to exert a continuous pull equal to 
one fortieth of the combined weight of the train. 
Tf, on the other hand, the ascent had been gradual, so that 
the grade was 66 feet per mile, a pull from the engine of one 
eightieth of the combined weight would have sufficed to land 
the train of cars at the crest of the grade. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 MAN'S WAY OF HELPING HIMSELF 
Because of these facts, engineers spend great sums in 
grading down railroad beds, making them as nearly level as 
possible. In mountainous regions, the topography of the 
land prevents the elimination of all steep grades, but never- 
theless the attempt is always made to follow the easiest grades. 
158. The Wedge. If an inclined 
a= plane is pushed underneath or 
within an object, it serves as a 
wedge. Usually a wedge consists 
of two inclined planes (Fig. 107). 
A chisel and an ax are illustra- 
tions of wedges. Perhaps the most 
as Z “#~ universal form of a wedge is our 
" common pin. Can you explain how Fic. 107. — By means of a wedge, ete 
the stump is split, this is a wedge? 
159. The Screw. Another valua- 
ble and indispensable form of the inclined plane is the screw. 
This consists of a,metal rod around which passes a ridge, and 
Figure 108 shows clearly that a screw is simply a 
rod around which (in effect) an inclined plane has 
been wrapped. 
The ridge encircling the screw is called the 
thread, and the distance between two successive 
threads is called the pitch. It is easy to see that 
the closer the threads and the smaller the pitch, Fic, 108,— 
the greater the advantage of the screw, and hence 4 screw as 
the less force needed in overcoming resistance. @ simple 
A corkscrew is a familiar illustration of the screw. 
160. Pulleys. The pulley, another of the machines, is 
merely a grooved wheel around which a cord passes. It is 
sometimes more convenient to move a load in one direction 
rather than in another, and the pulley in its simplest form 
enables us to do this. In order to raise a flag to ine = ton. a

a mast, it is not necessary to climb the mast, and so pull 
up the flag; the sameresult is accomplished much more easily 
by attaching the flag to a movable string, 
somewhat as in Figure 109, and pulling 
from below. As the string is pulled down, 
the flag rises and ultimately reaches the 
desired position. 
If we employ a stationary pulley, as in 
Figure 109, we do not change the force, be- 
cause the force required to balance the load 
is as large as the load itself. The only ad- 
vantage is thata force in one direction may 
be used to produce motion in another 
direction. Such a pulley is known as a 
fixed pulley. 
161. Movable Pulleys. By the use of 
a movable pulley, we are able to support 
a weight by a force equal to only one half 
the load. In Figure 109, the downward 
pull of the weight and the downward pull 
of the hand are equal; in Figure 110, the Fic. 109, — By means of 
spring balance supports only one half the 9a? a iohnase one 
entire load, the remaining half being borne _ tion in the opposite di- 
by the hook to which the string is attached. oe 
The weight is divided equally between the two parts of the 
string which passes around the pulley, so that each strand 
bears only one half of the burden. 
We have seen in our study of the lever and the inclined 
plane that an increase in force is always accompanied by a 
decrease in distance, and in the case of the pulley we naturally 
look for a similar result. If you raise the balance (Fig. 110) 12 
feet, you will find that the weight rises only 6 feet; if you 
raise the balance 24 inches, you will find that the weight rises 
   
-P-A-G-E-168
168 | MAN'S WAY OF HELPING HIMSELF 
12 inches. You must exercise a force of 100 pounds over 12 
feet of space in order to raise a weight of 200 pounds a distance 
of 6 feet. When we raise 100 pounds 
through 12 feet or 200 pounds through 6 
-feet the total work done is the same; but 
the pulley enables those who cannot furnish 
a force of 200 pounds for the space of 6 
feet to accomplish the task by furnishing 
100 pounds for the space of 12 feet. 
162. Combination of Pulleys. A combi- 
nation of pulleys called block and tackle is 
used where very heavy loads are to be 
moved. In Figure 111 
the upper block of pul- 
leys is fixed, the lower 
block is movable, and 
one continuous. rope 
passes around the vari- 
ous pulleys. The load is 
supported by 6 strands, 
Fi, 110.—A movable and each strand bears 
Pulleylightenslabor. ~— Sne sixth of the load. 
If the hand pulls with a force of 1 pound 
I at P, it can raise a load of 6 pounds at W, 
but the hand will have to pull downward 
6 feet at P in order to raise the load at 
Wt foot. If 8 pulleys were used, a force 
equivalent to one eighth of the load would Hie, Seo eee 
suffice to move W, but this force would have tive arrangement of 
to be exerted over a distance 8 times as eee ef 
great as that through which W was raised. 
163. Practical Application. In our childhood many of us 
saw with wonder the pipenenoce and disappearance of flags

WHEEL AND AXLE 169 
. 
flying at the tops of high masts, but observation soon taught 
us that the flags were raised by pulleys. In tenements, where 
there is no yard for the family washing, clothes often appear 
flapping in mid-air. This seems most marvelous until we learn 
that the lines are pulled back and forth by pulleys at the win- 
dow and ata distant support. By means of pulleys, awnings are 
raised and lowered, and the use of pulleys by furniture movers, 
etc., is familiar to every wide-awake observer on the streets. 
164. Wheel and Axle. The wheel and axle consists of a large 
wheel and a small axle so fastened that they rotate together. 
When the large wheel makes 7% @ = We, 4» 
one revolution, P falls a dis- ~ * * r 
tance equal to the circumfer- 
ence of the wheel. While P 
moves downward, W likewise 
moves, but its motion is upward, 
and the distance it moves is 
small, being equal only to the 
circumference of the small axle. 
But a small force at P will 
sustain a larger force at W; if FIG, 112,— The wheel and axle, 
the circumference of the large "40 > “@%- 
wheel is 40 inches, and that of the iewiall wheel 10 inches, a 
load of 100 at Wcan be sustained by a force of 25 at P. The in- 
crease in force of the wheel and axle depends upon the relative 
size of the two parts, that is, upon the circumference of wheel 
as compared with circumference of axle, and since the ratio 
between circumference and radius is constant, the ratio of 
the wheel and axle combination is the ratio of the long 
radius to the short radius. 
For example, in a wheel and axle of radii 20 and 4, 
respectively, a given weight at P would balance 5 times as 
great a load at W. 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  170 MAN’S WAY OF HELPING HIMSELF 
* 
165. Application: Windlass, Cogwheels. In the old-fash- 
ioned windlass used in farming districts, the large wheel is 
replaced by a handle which, when turned, describes a circle. 
Such an arrangement is equivalent to wheel and axle (Fig. 
112); the capstan used on shipboard for raising the anchor 
has the same principle. The kitchen coffee grinder and the 
meat chopper are other familiar illustrations. 
Cogwheels are modifications of the wheel and axle. Teeth 
cut in A fit into similar teeth cut in B, and hence rotation of 
A causes rotation of B. Several 
revolutions of the smaller wheel, 
however, are necessary in order to 
. turn the larger wheel through one 
complete revolution; if the radius 
of A is one half that of B, two revo- 
lutions of A will correspond to one 
(i) of B; if the radius of A is one third 
that of B, three revolutions of A 
will correspond to one of 2B. 
Experiment demonstrates that a 
Fic. 113. — Cogwheels, weight IV attached to a cogwheel of 
radius 3 can be raised by a force P, 
equal to one third of Wapplied to a cogwheelof radius 1. There 
is thus a great increase in force. But the speed with which Wis 
raised is only one third the speed with which the small wheel ro- 
tates, or increase in power has been at the decrease of speed. 
This is a very common method for raising heavy weights 
by small force. 
Cogwheels can be made to give speed at the decrease of force. 
A heavy weight W attached to B will in its slow fall cause 
rapid rotation of A, and hence rapid riseof P. It is true that 
P, the load raised, will be less than W, the force exerted, but if 
speed is our aim, this machine serves our purpose admirably. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  
  MEASUREMENT OF WORK iu 
An extremely important form of wheel and axle is that in 
which the two wheels are connected by belts as in Figure 114. 
Rotation of W induces rotation 
of w, and asmallforce at W is 
able to overcome a large force 
at w. An advantage of the 
belt connection is that power 
at one place can be transmitted , 2 : Fic, 114.— By means of a belt, motion 
over a considerable distance can be transferred from place to place. 
and utilized in another place. 
166. Compound Machines. Out of the few simple machines 
mentioned in the preceding Sections has developed the complex 
machinery of to-day. By acombination of screw and lever, for 
example, we obtain the advantage due to each device, and some 
compound machines have been made which combine all the va- 
rious kinds of simple machines, and in thisway multiply their me- 
chanical advantage many fold. 
A relatively simple com- 
plex machine called the crane 
(Fig. 116) maybe seen almost 
any day on the street, or 
wherever heavy weights are 
being lifted. Itis clear that a 
force applied to turn wheel 1 
causes a slower rotation of 
wheel 3, and a still slower 
rotation of wheel 4, but as 4 
rotates it winds up a chain and 
slowly raises Q. Avery com-

168. The Power or the Sosad with which Work is Done. A 
man can load a \ wagon more quickly than a growing boy. 
The work done by the one is equal to the work done by the 
other, but the man is more powerful, because the time required 
for a given task is very important. An engine which hoists 
a 50-pound weight in 1 second is much more powerful than a 
man who requires 50 seconds for the same task; hence in 
estimating the value of a working agent, whether animal or 
mechanical, we must consider not only the work done, but 
the speed with which it is done. 
The rate at which a machine is able to accomplish a unit 
of work is called power, and the unit of power customarily 
used is the horse power. Any power which can do 550 foot 
pounds of work per second is said to be one horse power 
(H.P.). This unit was chosen by James Watt, the inventor 
of a steam engine, when he was in need of a unit with which 
to compare the new source of power, the engine, with his old 
source of power, the horse. Although called a horse power 
it is greater than the power of an average horse. 
An ordinary man can do one sixth of a horse power. The 
average locomotive of a railroad has more than 500 H.P., while 
the engines of an ocean liner may have as high as 70,000 H.P. 
169. Waste Work and Efficient Work. In our study of ma- 
chines we omitted a factor which in practical cases cannot be 
ignored, namely, friction. No surface can be made perfectly 
smooth, and when a barrel rolls over an incline, or a rope 
passes over a pulley, or a cogwheel turns its neighbor, there 
is rubbing and slipping and sliding. Motion is thus hindered, 
and the effective value of the acting force is lessened. In 
order to secure the desired result it is necessary to apply a 
force in excess of that calculated. This extra force, which 
must be a if friction i is to be counteracted, is in reality 
waste work. / ee Lice. = ECA

If the force required by a machine is 150 pounds, while 
that calculated as necessary is 100 pounds, the loss due to 
friction is 50 pounds, and the machine, instead of being 
thoroughly efficient, is only two thirds efficient. 
Machinists make every effort to eliminate from a ma- 
chine the waste due to friction, leveling and grinding to the 
most perfect smoothness and adjustment every part of the 
»» . machine. When the machine is in use, friction may be further 
reduced by the use of lubricating oil. Friction can never 
be totally eliminated, however, and machines of even the finest 
construction lose by friction some of their efficiency, while 
poorly constructed ones lose by friction as much as one half 
of their efficiency. 
é 170. Man’s Strength not Sufficient for Machines. A machine, 
an inert mass of metal and wood, cannot of itself do any work, 
but can only distribute the 
energy which is brought to it. 
Fortunately it is not neces- 
sary that this energy should 
be contributed by man alone, 
because the store of energy 
possessed by him is very 
small in comparison with the 
energy required to run loco- 
motives, automobiles, saw- 
mills, etc. Perhaps the great- 
_ est value of machines lies in 
Fic. 118,— Man’s strength is not sufficient the fact that they enable man 
for heavy work, to perform work bythe use of 
energy other than his own. 
Figure 118 shows one way in which a horse’s energy can be 
utilized in lifting heavy loads. Even the fleeting wind has 
been harnessed by man, and, as in the windmill, made to work

mills large and small, and in Holland, the country of wind- 
mills, the land- 
owner who does 
not possess a

indeed.

A more constant source of energy is that available from the 
burning of fuel, such as coal and oil. The former is the 
source of energy in locomotives, the latter in most automobiles. 
In the following Chapter will be given an account of water, 
wind, and fuel as machine feeders.

CHAPT BR SVL 
THE POWER BEHIND THE ENGINE 
171. Small boys soon learn the power of running water ; 
swimming or rowing downstream is easy, while swimming or 
rowing against the current is difficult, and the swifter the 
water, the easier the one and the more difficult the other; 
the river assists or opposes us as we go with it or against it. 
The water of a quiet pool or of a gentle stream cannot do 
work, but water which is plunging over a precipice or dam, or is 
flowing down steep slopes, may be made to saw wood, grind 
our corn, light our streets, run our electric cars, etc. A 
waterfall, or a rapid stream, is a great asset to any community, 
and for this reason should be carefully guarded. Water power 
is as great a source of wealth as a coal bed or a gold mine. 
The most tremendous waterfall in our country is Niagara 
Falls, which every minute hurls millions of gallons of water 
down’ a 163-foot precipice. The energy possessed by such an 
enormous quantity of water flowing at such a tremendous 
speed is almost beyond everyday comprehension, and would 
suffice to run the engines of many cities far and near. Numer- 
ous attempts to buy from the United States the right to utilize 
some of this apparently wasted energy have been made by 
various commercial companies. It is fortunate that these 
negotiations have been largely fruitless, because much devia- 
tion of the water for commercial uses and the installation of 
machinery in the vicinity of the famous falls would greatly

detract from the beauty of this world-known scene, and would 
rob our country of a natural beauty unequaled elsewhere. 
172. Water Wheels. 
In Figure 120 the 
water of a small but 
rapid mountain stream 
is made to rotate a 
large wheel, which in 
turn communicates its 
motion through belts 
to a distant sawmill 
or grinder. In more 
level regions huge 
dams are built which 
hold back the water 
  FIG, 120, — A mountain stream turns the wheels of

from the dam the water is conveyed in pipes (flumes) to the

turns. Cogwheels or belts 
connect the paddle wheel 
with the factory machinery, 
so that motion of the paddle 
wheel insures the running 
of the machinery. 
One of the most efficient 
forms of water wheels is 
that shown in Figure 121, 
and called the Pelton wheel. 
Water issues in a narrow 
jet similar to that of the 
ordinary garden hose and strikes with great force against the 
lower part of the wheel, thereby causing rotation of the wheel. 
CL. GEN. SCI. — 12 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  178 THE POWER BEHIND THE ENGINE 
Belts transfer this motion to the machinery of factory or 
mill. 
173. Turbines. The most efficient form of water motor is 
the turbine, a strong metal wheel shaped somewhat like a pin 
wheel, inclosed in a heavy metal case. 
Water is conveyed from a reservoir or dam through a pipe 
(penstock) to the turbine case, in which is placed the heavy 
metal turbime wheel(Fig. 122). The force of the water causes 
rotation of the turbine and of the shaft which 
is rigidly fastened to it. The water which 
flows into the turbine case causes rotation 
of the wheel, escapes from the case through 
openings, and flows into the tail water. 
The power which a turbine can furnish 
depends upon the quantity of water and 
the height of the fall, and also upon the 
turbine wheel itself. One of the largest 
turbines known has a horse power of about 
20,000; that is, it is equivalent, approxi- 
mately, to 20,000 horses. 
174. How much is a Stream Worth? 
The work which a stream can perform 
may be easily calculated. Suppose, for 
example, that 50,000 pounds of water fall 
over a 22-foot dam every second; the power 
of such a stream would be 1,100,000 foot 
pounds per second or 2000 H.P. Natur- 
ally, a part of this power would be lost 
to use by friction within the machinery and 
by leakage, so that the power of a turbine run by a 2000 H.P. 
stream would be less than that value. 
Of course, the horse power to be obtained from a stream 
determines the size of the paddle wheel or turbine which can

  Fic. 122.— A turbine at

HOW MUCH IS A STREAM WORTH? 179 
be run by it. It would be possible to construct a turbine so 
large that the stream would not suffice to turn the wheel; for 
this reason, the power of a stream is carefully determined 
before machine construction is begun, and the size of the 
machinery depends upon the estimates of the water power 
furnished by expert engineers. 
A rough estimate of the volume of a stream may be made 
by the method described below : — 
Suppose we allow a stream of water to flow through a 
rectangular trough; the speed with which the water flows 
  
  
  Fic. 123. — Estimating the quantity of water which flows through the trough each 
second, 
through the trough can be determined by noting the time 
required for a chip to float the length of the trough; if the 
trough is ro feet long and the time required is 5 seconds, 
the water has a velocity of 2 feet per second. 
The quantity of water which flows through the trough each 
second depends upon the dimensions of the trough and the 
velocity of the water. Suppose the trough is 5 feet wide and 
3 feet high, or has a cross section of 15 square feet. If the 
velocity of the water were 1 foot per second, then 15 cubic feet 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
180 THE POWER BEHIND THE ENGINE 
of water would pass any given point each second, but since 
the velocity of the water is 2 feet per second, 30 cubic feet 
will represent the amount of water which will flow by a given 
point in one second. 
175. Quantity of Water Furnished bya River. Drive stakes 
in the river at various places and note the time required for 
a chip to float from one stake to another. If we know the 
\ distance between the stakes and the time required for the chip 
to float from one stake to another, the velocity of the water 
can be readily determined. 
The width of the stream from bank to bank is easily meas- 
ured, and the depth is obtained in the ordinary way by sound- 
ing; it is necessary to take a number of soundings because the 
bed of the river is by no means level, and soundings taken at 
only one level would not give an accurate estimate. If the 
soundings show the following depths: 30, 25, 20, 32, 28, the 
average depth could be taken as 30 + 25 + 20+ 324 28+ 
5, or 27 feet. If, as a result of measuring, the river at a given 
point in its course is found to be 27 feet deep and 60 feet 
wide, the area of a cross section at that spot would be 1620 
square feet, and if the velocity proved to be 6 feet per second, 
then the quantity of water passing in any one second would 
be 1620 x 6, or 9720 cubic feet. By experiment it has been 
found that 1 cu. ft. of water weighs about 62.5 Ib. The 
weight of the water passing each second would therefore be 
62.5 X 9720, or 607,500 lb. If this quantity of water plunges 
over a 10-ft. dam, it does 607,500 x 10, or 6,075,000 foot pounds 
of work per second, or 11,045 H.P. Such a stream would be 
very valuable for the running of machinery. 
176. Windmills. Those of us who have spent our vacation 
days in the country know that there is no ready-made water 
supply there as in the cities, but that as a rule the farmhouses 
obtain their drinking water from springs and wells. In poorer 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WINDMILL 181 
houses, water is laboriously carried in buckets from the spring 
or is lifted from the well by the windlass. In more prosperous 
houses, pumps are installed; this is an improvement over the 
original methods, but the quantity of water consumed by the 
average family is so great as to make the task of pumping an 
arduous one. f 
The average amount of water used per day by one person 
is 25 gallons. This includes water for drinking, cooking, dish 
washing, bathing, laundry. For a family of five, therefore, the 
daily consumption would be 125 gallons; if to this be added the 
water for a single horse, cow, and pig, the total amount needed 
will be approximately 150 gallons perday. A strong man can 
pump that amount from an ordinary well in about one hour, but 
if the well is deep, more time and strength are required. 
The invention of the windmill was a great boon to country 
folks because it eliminated from their always busy life one 
task in which labor and time were consumed. 
177. The Principle of the Windmill. The toy pin wheel is 
a windmill in miniature. The wind strikes the sails, and 
causes rotation; and the stronger 
the wind blows, the faster will the 
wheel rotate. In windmills, the 
sails are of wood or steel, instead 
of paper, but the principle is 
identical. 
As the wheel rotates, its motion 
is communicated to a mechanical 
device which makes use of it to 
raise and lower a plunger, and 
hence as long as the wind turns 6: 124.— The toy pin wheel is a miniature windmill, 
the windmill, water is raised. 
The water thus raised empties into a large tank, built either 
in the windmill tower or in the garret of the house, and from 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
182 THE POWER BEHIND THE ENGINE 
the tank the water flows through pipes to the different | 
parts of the house. On very windy days the wheel rotates 
  
  F1G, 125. — The windmill pumps water into the tank, 
rapidly, and the tank fills quickly; in order to guard against 
an overflow from the tank a mechanical device is installed 
which stops rotation of the wheel when the tank is nearly 
full. The supply tank is usually large enough to hold a supply 
of water sufficient for several days, and hence a continuous 
calm of a day or two does not materially affect the house flow. 
When once built, a windmill practically takes care of itself, ex- 
cept for oiling, and is an efficient and cheap domestic possession. 
£178. Steam as a Working Power. If a delicate vane is 
‘held at an opening from which steam issues, the pressure of 
the steam will cause rotation of the vane (Fig. 126), and if 
the vane is connected with a machine, work can be obtained 
from the steam.
-P-A-G-E-183
STEAM AS A WORKING POWER 183 
When water is heated in an open vessel, the pressure of its 
steam is too low to be of practical value, but if on the contrary 
  Fic, 126.—Steam as a source of 
power, FIG, 127.— Steam turbine with many 
blades and 4 nozzles, 
water is heated in an almost closed vessel, its steam pressure 
is considerable. If steam at high pressure is directed by noz- 
zles against the blades of a wheel, rapid rotation of the wheel 
ensues just as it didin Figure 121, although in this case steam 
pressure replaces water pressure. After the steam has spent 
itself in turning the turbine, it condenses into water and makes 
its escape through openings in an inclosing case. In Figure 
127 the protecting case is removed, in order that the form of 
the turbine and the positions of the nozzles may be visible. 
A single large turbine wheel may have as many as 800,000 
sails or blades, and steam may pour out upon these from 
many nozzles. 
The steam turbine is very much more efficient than its 
forerunner, the steam engine. The installation of turbines
-P-A-G-E-184
    184 THE POWER BEHIND THE ENGINE 
on ocean liners has been accompanied by great increase in 
speed, and by an almost corresponding decrease in the cost 
of maintenance. 
179. Steam Engines. A very simple illustration of the 
working of a steam engine is given in Figure 128. Steam 
under pressure enters 
through the opening F, 
passes through J, and 
presses upon the piston JZ, 
As a result JZ moves 
downward, and thereby in- 
duces rotation in the large 
wheel Z. 
As IM falls it drives the 
air in D out through O and 
P (the opening P is not 
visible in the diagram). 
As soon as this is accom- 
plished, a mechanical de- 
vice draws up the rod Z, 
which in turn closes the 
opening JV, and thus pre- 
vents the steam from pass- 
ing into the part of D 
above /. 
But when the rod £ is 
in such a position that V is closed, O on the other hand is 
open, and steam rushes through it into D and forces up the 
piston. This up-and down motion of the piston causes con- 
tinuous rotation of the wheel Z. If the fire is hot, steam is 
formed quickly, and the piston moves rapidly; if the fire is 
low, steam is formed slowly, and the piston moves less 
rapidly.

  GAS ENGINES 185 
The steam engine as seen on our railroad trains is 
very complex, and cannot be discussed here; in principle, 
however, it is identical with that just described. Fig- 
ure 129 shows a steam harvester at work on a modern 
farm. 
In both engine and turbine the real source of power is 
not the steam but the fuel, such as coal or oil, which converts 
the water into steam. 
180. Gas Engines. Automobiles have been largely re- 
sponsible for the gas engine. To carry coal for fuel and water 
for steam would be impracticable for most motor cars.. 
Electricity is used in some cars, but the batteries are heavy, 
expensive, and short-lived, and are not always easily replace-

able. For this reason gasoline is extensively used, and in the 
average automobile the source of power is the force generated 
by exploding gases. 
It was discovered some years ago that if the vapor of 
gasoline or naphtha was mixed with a definite quantity of air, 
and a light was applied to the mixture, an explosion would 
result. Modern science uses the force of such exploding gases 
for the accomplishment of work, such as running of automo- 
biles and launches. 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
186 THE POWER BEHIND THE ENGINE 
In connection with the gasoline supply is a carburetor or 
sprayer, from which the cylinder C (Fig. 130) receives a fine 
mist of gasoline vapor and air. This mixture is ignited by 
an automatic, electric sparking device, and the explosion of 
the gases drives the piston P to the right. In the 4-cycle 
type of gas engines (Fig. 130)— the kind used in automobiles 
—the four strokes are as follows: 1. The mixture of gasoline 
and air enters the cyl- 
inder as the piston 
moves to the right. 
2. The valves being 
closed, the mixture is 
compressed as the pis- 
ton moves to the left. 
3. The electric spark 
ignites the com- 
pressed mixture and drives the piston to the right. 4. The 
waste gas is expelled as the piston moves to the left. The 
exhaust valve is then closed, the inlet valve opened, and an- 
other cycle of four strokes begins. 
The use of gasoline in launches and automobiles is familiar 
tomany. Not only are launches and automobiles making use 
of gas power, but the gasoline engine has made it possible to 
propel aéroplanes through the air.

CHAPTER XVIII 
PUMPS AND THEIR VALUE TO MAN 
181. “As difficult as for water to run up a hill!” Is 
there any one who has not heard this saying? And yet 
most of us accept as a matter of course the stream which 
gushes from our faucet, or give no thought to the ingenuity 
which devised a means of forcing water upward through 
pipes. Despite the fact that water flows naturally down hill, 
and not up, we find it available in our homes and office 
buildings, in some of which it ascends to the fiftieth floor; 
and we see great streams of it directed upon the tops of 
burning buildings by firemen in the streets below. 
In the country, where there are no great central pumping 
stations, water for the daily need must be raised from wells, 
and the supply of each household is dependent upon the 
labor and foresight of its members. The water may be 
brought to the surface either by laboriously raising it, bucket 
by bucket, or by the less arduous method of pumping. 
These are the only means possible; even the windmill does 
not eliminate the necessity for the pump, but merely replaces 
the energy used by man in working it. 
In some parts of our country we have oil beds or: wells. 
But if this underground oil is to be of service to man, it must 
be brought to the surface, and this is accomplished, as in the 
case of water, by the use of pumps. 
An old tin can or a sponge may serve to bale out water 
from a leaking rowboat, but such a crude device would be ab- 
187

surd if employed on our huge vessels of war and commerce. 
Here a rent in the ship’s side would mean inevitable loss 
were it not possible to rid the ship of the inflowing water by 
the action of strong pumps. 
Another and very different use to which pumps are put is 
seen in the compression of gases. Air is forced into the tires 
of bicycles and automobiles until they become sufficiently in- 
flated to insure comfort in riding. Some present-day sys- 
tems of artificial refrigeration (Section 93) could not exist 
without the aid of compressed gases. 
Compressed air has played a very important réle in mining, 
being sent into poorly ventilated mines to improve the condi- 
tion of the air, and to supply to the miners the oxygen neces- 
sary for respiration. Divers and men who work under water 
carry on their backs a tank of compressed air, and take from 
it, at will, the amount required. 
There are many forms of pumps, and they serve widely 
different purposes, being essential to the operation of many 
industrial — undertak- 
ings. In the follow- 
ing Sections some of 
these forms will be 
studied. 
182. The Air as 
Man’s Servant. Long 
before man harnessed 
water for turbines, or 
steam for engines, he 
made the air serve his 
purpose, and by means of it raised water from hidden under- 
ground depths to the surface of the earth; likewise, by 
means of it, he raised to his dwelling on the hillside 
water from the stream in the valley below. Those who     i ERR sed 
FIG, 131. —Carrying water home from the spring. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE COMMON PUMP OR LIFTING PUMP 189. 
live in cities where running water is always present in the 
home cannot realize the hardship of the days when this 
“ready-made” supply did not exist, but when man labori- 
ously carried to his dwelling, from distant spring and stream, 
the water necessary for the daily need. 
What are the characteristics of the air which have enabled 
man to accomplish these feats? They are well known to us 
and may be briefly stated as follows :— 
(1) Air has weight, and 1 cubic foot of air, at atmospheric 
pressure, weighs 1} ounces. 
(2) The air around us presses with a force of about 15 
pounds upon every square inch of surface 
that it touches. 
(3) Air is elastic; it can be compressed, 
as in the balloon or bicycle tire, but it ex- 
pands immediately when pressure is reduced. 
As it expands and occupies more space, its 
pressure falls and it exerts less force against 
the matter with which it comes in contact. 
If, for example, 1 cubic foot of air is allowed 
to expand and occupy 2 cubic feet of space, 
the pressure which it exerts is reduced one 
half. When air is compressed, its pressure 
increases, and it exerts a greater force against |: 
the matter with which it comes in contact. 
If 2 cubic feet of air are compressed to. 1 Fi¢.132.—Theatmos- ‘ z, phere pressing 
cubic foot, the pressure of the compressed air downward on a@ 
is doubled. (See Section 89.) pegeaicnyt 
183. The Common Pump or Lifting Pump. 
Place a tube containing aclose-fitting piston in a vessel of water, 
as shown in Figure 132. Then raise the piston with the hand 
and notice that the water rises in the piston tube. The rise of 
water in the piston tube is similar to the raising of lemonade    
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 PUMPS AND THEIR VALUE TO MAN 
through a straw (Section 77). The atmosphere presses with 
a force of 15 pounds upon every square inch of water in the 
large vessel, and forces some of it into the space left vacant 
by the retreating piston. The common pump works in a simi- 
lar manner. It consists of a piston or plunger which moves 
back and forth in an air-tight cylinder, and contains an out- 
ward opening valve through which water and air can pass. 
From the bottom of the cylinder a tube runs down into the 
’ well or reservoir, and water from the well has access to the 
cylinder through another outward-moving valve. In practice 
the tube is known as the suction pipe, and its valve as the 
suction valve. 
In order to understand the action of a pump, we will sup- 
pose that no water is in the pump, and we will pump until 
a stream issues from the spout. The various stages are repre- 
sented diagrammatically by Figure 133. In (1) the entire 
pump is empty of water but full of air at atmospheric pres- 
sure, and both valves are closed. In (2) the plunger is be- 
ing raised and is lifting the column of air that rests on it. 
The air and water in the inlet pipe, being thus partially re- 
lieved of downward pressure, are pushed up by the atmospheric 
pressure on the surface of the water in the well. When 
the piston moves downward as in (3), the valve in the pipe 
closes by its own weight, and the air in the cylinder escapes 
through the valve in the plunger. In (4) the piston is again 
rising, repeating the process of (2). In (5) the process of (3) 
is being repeated, but water instead of air is escaping through 
the valve in the plunger. In (6) the process of (2) is being 
repeated, but the water has reached the spout and is flowing 
out. 
After the pump is in condition (6), motion of the plunger 
is followed by a more or less regular discharge of water 
through the spout, and the quantity of water which gushes

forth depends upon the speed with which the piston is moved. 
A strong man giving quick strokes can produce a large flow ; 
a child, on the other hand, is able to produce only a thin 
stream. Whoever pumps must exert sufficient force to lift 
the water from the surface of the well to the spout exit. For 
this reason the pump has received the name of /ifting pump. 
184. The Force Pump. In the common pump, water can- 
not be raised higher than the spout. In many cases it is 
desirable to force water considerably above 
the pump itself, as, for instance, in the fire 
hose; under such circumstances a type of 
pump is employed which has received the 
name of force pump. This differs but little 
from the ordinary lift pump, as a reference 
to Figure 134 willshow. Here both valves 
are placed in the cylinder, and the piston 
is solid, but the principle is the same as in 
the lifting pump. 
An upward motion of the plunger allows 
water to enter the cylinder, and the down- 
ward motion of the plunger drives water 
through Z. (Is this true for the lift pump 
as well?) Since only the downward motion 
FIG. 134. — Force of the plunger forces water through £, the 
Bae discharge is intermittent and is therefore 
not practical for commercial purposes. In order to convert this 
intermittent discharge into a steady stream, an air chamber 
is installed near the discharge tube, as in Figure 135. The 
water forced into the air chamber by the downward-moving 
piston compresses the air and increases its pressure. The 
pressure of the confined air reacts against the water and 
tends to drive it out of the chamber. Hence, even when the 
plunger is moving upward, water is forced through the pipe 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE 193 
because of the pressure of the compressed air. In this way 
a continuous flow is secured. 
The height to which the water can be forced in the pipe de- 
pends upon the size and construction of the pump and upon the 
force with which the plunger can be 
moved. The larger the stream desired 
and the greater the height to be reached, 
the stronger the force ‘needed and the 
more powerful the construction neces- 
sary. 
The force pump gets its name from 
the fact that the moving piston drives or 
forces the water through the discharge 
tube. 
185. Irrigation and Drainage. History 
shows that the lifting pump has been 
used by man since the fourth century 
before Christ; for many present-day 
enterprises this ancient form of pump 
is inconvenient and impracticable, and Fre, 135,—The air cham- 
hence it has been replaced in many — be seein 
cases by more modern types, such as * 
rotary and centrifugal pumps (Fig. 136). In these forms, 
rapidly rotating wheels lift the water and drive it onward 
into a discharge pipe, from which it issues with great force. 
There is neither piston nor valve in these pumps, and the 
quantity of water raised and the force with which it is driven 
through the pipes depends solely upon the size of the wheels 
and the speed with which they rotate. 
Irrigation, or the artificial watering of land, is of the greatest 
importance in those parts of the world where the land is nat- 
urally too dry for farming. In the United States, approxi- 
mately two fifths of the land area is so dry as to be worthless

for agricultural purposes unless artificially watered. In the 
West, several large irrigating systems have been built by the 
federal government, 
and at present about 
ten million acres of 
land have been con- 
verted from worthless 
farms into fields rich 
in crops. Many irri- 
gating systems use

to drive water from a region of abundance to a remote region 
of scarcity. 
The draining of land is also a matter of considerable im- 
portance; swamps and marshes which were at one time con- 
sidered useless have been drained and then reclaimed and 
converted into good farming land. The surplus water is best

removed by centrifugal pumps, since sand and sticks which 
would clog the valves of an ordinary pump are passed along 
without difficulty by the rotating wheel.

allurement of a vacation camp in the heart of the woods is so

great as to make many campers ignore the vital importance 
of securing a safe water supply. A river bank may be 
beautiful and teeming with diversions, but if the river is used 
as a source of drinking water, the results will almost always 
be fatal to some. The water can be boiled, it is true, but few 
campers are willing to forage for the additional wood needed 
for this apparently unnecessary requirement; then, too, 
boiled water does not cool readily in summer, and hence is 
disagreeable for drinking purposes. 
The only safe course is to abandon the river as a source 
of drinking water, and if a spring cannot be found, to drive 
a well. In many regions, especially in the neighborhood of
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 PUMPS AND THEIR VALUE TO MAN 
streams, water can be found ten or fifteen feet below the sur- 
face. Water taken from such a depth has filtered through a 
bed of soil, and is fairly safe for any purpose. Of course 
the deeper the well, the safer will be the water. With the 
use of such a pump as will be described, campers can, without 
grave danger, throw dish water, etc., on the ground somewhat 
remote from the camp; this may not injure their drinking 
water because the liquids will slowly seep through the ground, 
and as they filter downward will lose their dangerous matter. 
All the water which reaches the well pipes will have filtered 
through the soil bed and therefore will probably be safe. 
But while the careless disposal of wastes may not spoil the 
drinking water (in the well to be described), other laws of 
health demand a thoughtful disposal of wastes. The mala- 
rial mosquito and the typhoid fly flourish in unhygienic 
quarters, and the only way to guard against their dangers is 
to allow them neither food nor breeding place. 
The burning of garbage, the discharge of waters into cess- 
pools, or, in temporary camps, the discharge of wastes to dis- 
tant points through the agency of a cheap sewage pipe 
will insure safety to campers, will lessen the trials of flies and 
mosquitoes, and will add but little to the expense. 
187. A Cheap Well for Campers. A two-inch galvanized 
iron: pipe with a strong, pointed end containing small perfora- 
tions is driven into the ground with a sledge hammer. After 
it has penetrated for a few feet, another length is added and 
the whole is driven down, and this is repeated until water is 
reached. A cheap pump is then attached to the upper end 
of the drill pipe and serves to raise the water. During the 
drilling, some soil particles get into the pipe through the 
perforations, and these cloud the water at first; but after 
the pipe has once been cleaned by the upward-moving water, 
the supply remains clear. The flow from sucha well is natur-
-P-A-G-E-197
    
e OUR SUMMER VACATION 197 
ally small; first, because water is not abundant near the 
surface of the earth, and second, because cheap pumps are 
poorly constructed and cannot 
raise a large amount. But the sup- 
ply will usually be sufficient for 
the needs of simple camp life, and 
many a small farm uses this form 
of well, not only for household 
purposes, but for watering the 
cattle in winter. 
If the cheapness of such pumps 
were known, their use would be 
more general for temporary pur- 
poses. The cost of material need 
not exceed $5 for a 10-foot well, 
and the driving of the pipe could 
be made as much a part of the 
camping as the pitching of the 
tent itself. If the camping site is 
abandoned at the close of the va- 
cation, the pump can be removed 
and kept over winter for use the 
following summer in another place. Fic. 139.— A driven well. 
In this way the actual cost of the 
water supply can be reduced to scarcely more than $3, the re- 
movable pump being a permanent possession. In rocky or 
mountain regions the driven well is not practicable, because 
the driving point is blunted and broken by the rock and can- 
not pierce the rocky beds of land. : 
188. Our Summer Vacation. It has been asserted by some 
city health officials that many cases of typhoid fever in cities 
can be traced to the unsanitary conditions existing in summer 
resorts. The drinking water of most cities is now under

stances receives no attention whatever. The sewage disposal 
is often inadequate and badly planned, and the water becomes 
dangerously contaminated. A strong, healthy person, with 
plenty of outdoor exercise and with hygienic habits, may be 
able to resist the disease germs present in the poor water 
supply ; more often the summer guests carry back with them 
to their winter homes the germs of disease, and these gain 
the upper hand under the altered conditions of city and busi- 
ness life. It is not too much to say that every man and
-P-A-G-E-199
  OUR SUMMER VACATION 199° 
woman should know the source of his summer table water 
and the method of sewage disposal. If the conditions are 
unsanitary, they cannot be reme- 
died at once, but another resort 
can be found and personal danger 
can be avoided. Public sentiment 
and the loss of trade will go far 
in furthering an effort toward 
better sanitation. 
In the driven well, water can- 
not reach the spout unless it has 
first filtered through the soil to the 
depth of the driven pipe; after 
such a journey it is fairly safe, 
unless very large quantities of 
sewage are present; generally 
speaking, such a depth of soil is 
able to filter satisfactorily the 
drainage of the limited number 
of people which a driven well 
suffices to supply. 
Abundant water is rarely 
reached at less than 75 feet, and 
it would usually be impossible to 
drive a pipe to such a depth. 
When a large quantity of water 
is desired, strong machines drill 
into the ground and excavate an 
opening into which a wide pipe 
can be lowered. I recently spent 
a summer in the Pocono Moun-     Fic. 141.—A deep well with the

to over 300 feet before a flow was obtained sufficient to satisfy 
the owner. The water thus obtained was to be the sole 
water supply of a hotel accommodating 150 persons; the 
proprietor calculated that the requirements of his guests, 
for bath, toilet, laundry, kitchen, etc., and the domes- 
tics employed to serve them, together with the livery at their

: The water from such a well is safe and pure except un- 
| der the conditions represented in Figure 142. If sewage 
or slops be poured upon the ground in the neighborhood 
of the well, the liquid will seep through the ground and 
some may make its way into the pump before it has been 
purified by the earth. The impure liquid will thus contami- 
nate the otherwise pure water and will render it decidedly 
harmful. For absolute safety the sewage discharge should

be at least 75 feet from the well, and in large hotels, where 
there is necessarily a large quantity of sewage, the distance 
should be much greater. As the sewage seeps through the 
ground it loses its impurities, but the quantity of earth re- 
quired to purify it depends upon its abundance; a small 
depth of soil cannot take care of an indefinite amount of 
sewage. Hence, the greater the number of people in a 
hotel, or the more abundant the sewage, the greater should 
be the distance between well and sewer. 
By far the best way to avoid contamination is to see to it that 
the sewage discharges into the ground de/ow the well; that 
is, to dig the well in such a location that the sewage drainage 
will be away from the well. 
In cities and towns and large summer communities, the 
sewage of individual buildings drains into common tanks 
erected at public expense; the contents of these are dis- 
charged in turn into harbors and streams, or are otherwise 
disposed of at great expense, although they contain valuable 
substances. It has been estimated that the drainage or sewage 
of England alone would be worth $80,000,000 a year if used 
as fertilizer. 
A few cities, such as Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio, realize 
the need of utilizing this source of wealth, and by chemical 
means deodorize their sewage and change it into substances 
useful for agricultural and industrial purposes. There is still 
a great deal to be learned on this subject, and it is possible 
that chemically treated sewage may be made a source of 
income to a community rather than an expense. 
189. Pumps which Compress Air. The pumps considered 
in the preceding Sections have their widest application in 
agricultural districts, where by means of them water is raised

From a commercial and industrial standpoint a most im-

portant class of pump is that known as the compression 
type; in these, air or any other gas is compressed rather 
than rarefied. 
Air brakes and self-opening and self-closing doors on cars 
“are operated by means of compression pumps. The laying 
of bridge and pier foundations, in fact all work which must 
be done under water, is possible only through the agency of 
compression pumps. Those who have visited mines, and 
have gone into the heart of the under-ground labyrinth, 
know how difficult it is for fresh air to make its way to the 
miners. Compression pumps have eliminated this difficulty, 
and to-day fresh air is constantly pumped into the mines to 
supply the laborers there. Agricultural methods also have 
been modified by the compression pump. The spraying of 
trees (Fig. 143), 
formerly done 
slowly and labo- 
riously, is now 
a relatively 
simple matter.

raised, the lower valve closes, the upper valve is opened by 
atmospheric pressure, and air from out- 
side enters the cylinder; the next stroke 
of the piston drives a fresh supply of 
air intothetire, which thus in time be- 
comes inflated. In most cheap bicycle 
pumps, the piston valve is replaced by 
a soft piece of leather so attached to the 
piston that it allows air to slip around 
it and into the cylinder, but prevents 
its escape from the cylinder (Fig. 144).

Blow into the tube and see whether

clear of water. Thisis, in brief, the 
principle employed for work under 
water. A compression pump forces 
air through a tube into the chamber in 
which men are to work (Fig. 146).

carries on his back a tank of compressed air, from which the 
air escapes through a tube to the space between the body 
and the suit. When the air has become foul, the diver 
opens a valve in his suit and allows it to pass into the water, 
at the same time admitting a fresh supply from the tank. 
The valve opens outward from the body, and hence will allow 
of the exit of air but not of the entrance of water. When the 
diver ceases work and desires to rise to the surface, he signals 
and is drawn up by a rope attached to the suit. 
192. Combination of Pumps. In many cases the combined 
use of both exhaust and compression pumps is necessary to 
secure the desired result; as, for example, in pneumatic dis- 
patch tubes. These are employed in the transportation of 
letters and small packages from building to building or be- 
tween parts of the same building. A pump removes air 
from the part of the tube ahead of the package, and thus re- 
duces the resistance, while a compression pump forces air 
into the tube behind the package and thus drives it forward 
with great speed.

  CHAPTER XIX 
THE WATER PROBLEM OF A LARGE CITY 
193. It is by no means unusual for the residents of a large 
city or town to receive through the newspapers a notification 
that the city water supply is running low and that economy 
should be exercised in its use. The problem of supplying a 
large city with an abundance of pure water is among the 
most difficult tasks which city officials have to perform, and is 
‘one little understood and appreciated by the average citizen. 
Intense interest in personal and domestic affairs is natural, 
but every citizen, rich or poor, should have an interest in 
civic affairs as well, and there is no better or more important 
place to begin than with the water supply. One of the 
most stirring questions in New York to-day has to do with 
the construction of huge aqueducts designed to convey to the 
residents of the city, water from the distant Catskill Mountains. 
The growth of the population has been so phenomenally rapid 
that the combined output of all available near-by sources does 
not suffice to meet the increasing consumption. 
Where does your city obtain its water? Does it bring it to 
its reservoirs in the most economic way possible, and is there 
any legitimate excuse for the scarcity of water which many 
communities face in dry seasons? 
194. Two Possibilities. Sometimes a city is fortunate 
enough to be situated near hills and mountains through which 
streams flow, and in that case the water problem is simple. 
In such a case all that is necessary is to run pipes, usually 
underground, from the elevated lakes or streams to the in-

dividual houses, or to common reservoirs from which it is 
distributed to the various buildings. 
Figure 148 illustrates in a simple way the manner in which 
a mountain lake may serve to supply the inhabitants of a

valley. The city of Denver, for example, is surrounded by 
mountains abounding in streams of pure, clear water; pipes 
convey the water from these heights to the city, and thus a 
cheap and adequate flow is obtained. Such a system is 
known as the gravity system. The nearer and steeper the 
elevation, the greater the force with which the water flows 
through the valley pipes, and hence the stronger the dis- 
charge from the faucets. 
Relatively few cities and towns are so favorably situated as 
regards water; more often the mountains are too distant, or 
the elevation is too slight, to be of practical value. Cities 
situated in. plains and remote from mountains are obliged to 
utilize the water of such streams as flow through the land, 
forcing it to the necessary height by means of pumps. 
Streams which flow through populated regions are apt to be 
contaminated, and hence water from them requires public

  208 THE WATER PROBLEM OF A LARGE CITY 
filtration. Cities using such a water supply thus have the 
double expense of pumping and filtration. 
195. The Pressure of Water. No practical business man 
would erect a turbine or paddle wheel without calculating in 
advance the value of his water power. The paddle wheel 
might be so heavy that the stream could not turn it, or so 
frail in comparison with the water force that the stream would 
destroy it. In just as careful a manner, the size and the 
strength of municipal reservoirs and pumps must be calcu- 
lated. The greater the quantity of water to be held in the 
reservoir, the heavier are the walls required; the greater the 
elevation of the houses, the stronger must be the pumps and 
the.engines which run them. 
In order to understand how these calculations are made, 
we must study the physical characteristics of water just as we 
studied the physical characteristics 
of air. 
When we measure water, we find 
that 1 cubic foot of it weighs about 
62.5 pounds; this is equivalent to 
saying that water 1 foot deep presses 
on the bottom of the containing 
vessel with a force of 62.5 pounds 
to the square foot. If the water is 
2 feet deep, the load supported by 
the vessel is doubled, and the pres- 
sure on each square foot of the 
bottom of the vessel will be 125 
Fic, 149.— Water x foot deep pounds, and if the water is 10 feet 
Pee deep, the load borne by each square 
: foot will be 625 pounds. The deeper 
the water, the greater will be the weight sustained by the con- 
fining vessel and the greater the pressure exerted by the water.

  WHY WATER SUPPLY 1S NOT UNIFORM BOO is a 
Since the pressure borne by 1 square foot of surface is 
62.5 pounds, the pressure supported by 1 square inch of sur- 
face is z}4 of 62.5 pounds, or .43 pound, nearly } pound. 
Suppose ‘a vessel held water to the depth of 10 feet, then 
upon every square inch of the bottom of that vessel there ‘ 
would be a pressure of 4.34 pounds. If a one-inch tap 
were inserted in the bottom of the vessel so that the water 
flowed out, it would gush forth with a force of 4.34 pounds. 
If the water were 20 feet deep, the force of the outflowing 
water would be twice as strong, because the pressure would 
be doubled. But the 
flow would not remain 
constant, because as 
the water leaves the 
outlet, less and less of 
it remains in the vessel, 
and hence the pressure 
gradually sinks and the 
flow drops correspond- 
ingly. 
In seasons of pro- 
longed drought, the 
streams which feed a 
city reservoir are apt 
to contain less than the 
usual amount of water, 
hence the level of the 
water supply sinks, the 
pressure at the outlet F1G. 150.— The pressure at an outlet decreases as 
the level of the water supply sinks. 
      
falls, and the force of 
the outflowing water is lessened (Fig. 150). 
196. Why the Water Supply is not uniform in All Parts of 
the City. In the preceding Section, we saw that the flow

-P-A-G-E-210
  210 THE WATER PROBLEM OF A LARGE CITY 
from a faucet depends upon the height of the reserve water 
above the tap. Houses on a level with the main supply pipes 
(Figs. 148 and 151) have a strong flow because the water is 
under the pressure of a column 4; houses situated on eleva- 
tion B have less flow, because the water is. under the pres- 
sure of a shorter column 8; and houses at a considerable 
elevation C have a less rapid flow corresponding to the 
diminished depth (C). 
Not only does the flow vary with the elevation of the house, 
but it varies with the location of the faucet within the house. 
Unless the reservoir is very high, or the pumps very power- 
ful, the flow on the upper floors is noticeably less than that 
  FIG. 151. — Water pressure varies in different parts of a water system. 
in the cellar, and in the upper stories of some high, building 
the flow is scarcely more than a feeble trickle. 
When the respective flows at A, B, and C (Fig. 151) are 
measured, they are found to be far lower than the pressures 
which columns of water of the heights A, B, and C have been 
shown by actual demonstration to exert. This is because 
water, in flowing from place to place, expends force in over- 
coming the friction of the pipes and the resistance of the air. 
The greater the distance traversed by the water in its journey 
from reservoir to faucet, the greater the waste force and the 
less the final flow. : 
In practice, large mains lead from the reservoir to the city, 
smaller mains convey the water to the various sections of the 
city, and service pipes lead to the individual house taps.
-P-A-G-E-211
  
  WHY WATER DOES NOT ALWAYS FLOW 211 
During this long journey, considerable force is expended 
against friction, and hence the flow at a distance from the 
reservoir falls to but a fraction of its original strength. For 
this reason, buildings situated near the main supply have a 
much stronger flow (Fig. 152) than those on the same level 
but remote from the supply. Artificial reservoirs are usually 
constructed on the near outskirts of a town in order that the 
  Fic. 152.— The more distant the fountain, the weaker the flow. 
frictional force lost in transmission may be reduced to a 
minimum. 
In the case of a natural reservoir, such as an elevated lake 
or stream, the distance cannot be planned or controlled. 
New York, for example, will secure an abundance of pure 
water from the Catskill Mountains, but it will lose force in 
transmission. Los Angeles is undertaking one of the greatest 
municipal projects of the day. Huge aqueducts are being 
built which will convey pure mountain water a distance of 
250 miles, and in quantities sufficient to supply two million 
people. According to calculations, the force of the water 
will be so great that pumps will not be needed. 
197. Why Water does not always flow from a Faucet. 
Most of us have at times been annoyed by the inability to 
secure water on an upper story, because of the drawing off
-P-A-G-E-212
  
      212 THE WATER. PROBLEM OF A LARGE CITY 
of a supply on a lower floor. During the working hours of 
the day, immense quantities of water are drawn off from in- 
numerable faucets, and hence the quantity in the pipes de- 
creases considerably unless the supply station is able to drive 
water through the vast network of pipes as fast as it is drawn 
off. Buildings at a distance from the reservoir suffer under 
such circumstances, because while the diminished pressure is 
ordinarily powerful enough to supply the lower floors, it is 
frequently too weak to force a continuous stream to high 
levels. At night, however, and out of working hours, few 
faucets are open, less water is drawn off at any one time, and 
the intricate pipes are constantly full of water under high 
pressure. At such times, a good flow is 
obtainable even on the uppermost floors. 
In order to overcome the disadvantage 
of a decrease in flow during the day, stand- 
pipes (Fig. 153) are sometimes placed in 
various sections. These are practically 
small steel reservoirs full of water and 
connecting with the city pipes. During 
“rush” hours, water passes from these into 
the communicating pipes and increases 
the available supply, while during the 
night, when the faucets are turned off, 
water accumulates in the standpipe against 
the next emergency (Figs. 151 and 154). 
The service rendered by the standpipe is 
similar to that of the air cushion discussed

source of the supply is more or less on a level with the sur- 
rounding land, the cost is great, because the supply for 
the entire city must either be pumped into an artificial reser- 
voir, from which it can be distributed, or else must be driven 
directly through the mains (Fig. 154). 
A gallon of water weighs approximately 8.3 pounds, and 
hence the work done by a pump in raising a gallon of water 
to the top of an average house, an elevation of 50 feet, is 
8.3 xX 50, or 415 foot pounds. A small manufacturing town 
uses at least 1,000,000 gallons daily, and the work done by a

pump in raising that amount to an elevation of 50 feet would 
be 8.3 X 1,000,000 X 50, or 415,000,000 foot pounds. 
The total work done during the day by the pump, or the 
engine driving the pump, is 415,000,000 foot pounds, and 
hence the work done during one hour would be sy of 
415,000,000, or 17,291,666 foot pounds; the work done in one 
minute would be gy of 17,291,666, or 288,194 foot pounds, 
and the work done each second would be jy of 288,194, or 
4803 foot pounds. 
A 1-H.P. engine does 550 foot pounds of work each 
second, and therefore if the pump is to be opérated by 
an engine, the strength of the latter would have to be 8.7 
H.P. An 8.7-H.P. pumping engine working at full speed 
every second of the day and night would be able to supply
-P-A-G-E-214
214 THE WATER PROBLEM OF A LARGE CITY 
the town with the necessary amount of water. When, how- 
ever, we consider the actual height to which the water is 
raised above the pumping station, and the extra pumping 
which must be done in order to balance the frictional loss, 
it is easy to understand that in actual practice a much more 
powerful engine would be needed. The larger the piston 
and the faster it works, the greater is the quantity of water 
raised at each stroke, and the stronger must be the engine 
which operates the pump. 
In many large cities there is no one single pumping station 
from which supplies run to all parts of the city, but several 
pumping stations are scattered throughout the city, and each 
of them supplies a restricted territory. 
I99. The Bursting of Dams and Reservoirs. The construc- 
tion of a safe reservoir is one of the most important problems 
of engineers. In October, 1911, a town in Pennsylvania was 
: ' virtually wiped out of existence because of the bursting of a 
dam whose structure was of insufficient strength to resist the 
strain of the vast quantity of water held by it. A similar 
breakage was the cause of the fatal Johnstown flood in 1889, 
which destroyed no less than seven towns, and in which approxi- 
mately 2000 persons are said to haye lost their lives. 
Water presses not only on the bottom of a vessel, but upon 
the sides as well; a bucket leaks whether the hole is in its 
side or its bottom, showing that water presses not only down- 
ward but outward. Usually a leak in a dam or reservoir 
occurs near the bottom. Weak spots at the top are rare and 
easily repaired, but a leak near the bottom is usually fatal, 
and in the case of a large reservoir the outflowing water 
carries death and destruction to everything in its path. 
If the leak is near the surface, as at a (Fig. 155), the water 
issues as a feeble stream, because the pressure against the 
sides at that level is due solely to the relatively small height 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE BURSTING OF DAMS AND RESERVOIRS 215 
of water above a (Section 195). If the leak is lower, as at 4, 
the issuing stream is stronger and swifter, because at that 
level the outward pressure is much greater than at a, the 
increase being due to the fact that 
the height of the water above 4 is 
greater than that above a. If the 
leak is quite low, as at c¢, the issuing 
stream has a still greater speed and 
strength, and gushes forth with a 
force determined by the height of 
the water above c. 
The dam at Johnstown was nearly 
4 mile wide, and 40 feet high, and so 
  Fic. 155.—The flow from an

height of water above the open- the escaping stream that within an ces 
hour after the break had occurred, 
the water had traveled a distance of 18 miles, and had de- 
stroyed property to the value of millions of dollars. 
If a reservoir has a depth of 100 feet, the pressure exerted 
upon each square foot of its floor is 62.5 x 100, or 6250 
pounds; the weight therefore to be sustained by every 
square foot of the reservoir floor is somewhat more than 
3 tons, and hence strong foundations are essential. The 
outward lateral pressure at a depth of 25 feet would be only 
one fourth as great as that on the bottom — hence the strain 
on the sides at that depth would be relatively slight, and a 
less powerful construction would suffice. But at a depth of 
50 feet the pressure on the sides would be one half that of 
the floor pressure, or 1} tons. At a depth of 75 feet, the 
pressure on the sides would be three quarters that on the 
bottom, or 2} tons. As the bottom of the reservoir is ap- 
proached, the pressure against the sides increases, and more 
powerful construction becomes necessary.
-P-A-G-E-216
    216 THE WATER PROBLEM OF A LARGE CITY 
Small elevated tanks, like those of the windmill, frequently 
have heavy iron bands around their: lower portion as a pro- 
tection against the extra strain. 
Before erecting a dam or reservoir, the maximum pressure 
to be exerted upon every square inch of surface should be 
accurately calculated, and 
the structure should then be 
built in such a way that the 
varying pressure of the 
water can be sustained. It 
is not sufficient that the 
bottom be strong ; the sides 
likewise must support their 
SE strain, and hence must be

water against them. depth. This strengthening 
of the walls is seen clearly 
in the reservoir shown in Figure 152. The bursting of dams 
and reservoirs has occasioned the loss of so many lives, and the 
destruction of so much property, that some states are consider- 
ing the advisability of federal inspection of all such structures. 
200. The Relation of Forests to the Water Supply. When 
heavy rains fall on a bare slope, or when snow melts on a 
barren hillside, a small amount of the water sinks into the 
ground, but by far the greater part of it runs off quickly and 
swells brooks and streams, thus causing floods and freshets. 
When, however, rain falls on a wooded slope, the action is 
reversed ; a small portion runs off, while the greater portion 
sinks into the soft earth. This is due partly to the fact that 
the roots of trees by their constant growth keep the soil loose 
and open, and form channels, as it were, along which the 
water can easily run. It is due alsoto the presence on the 
ground of decaying leaves and twigs, or humus, The decay-   
    
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  RELATION OF FORESTS TO THE WATER SUPPLY 217 
ing vegetable matter which covers the forest floor acts more 
or less as a sponge, and quickly absorbs falling rain and 
melting snow. The water which thus passes into the humus 
and the soil beneath does not remain there, but slowly seeps 
downward, and finally after weeks and months emerges at a 
lower level as a stream. Brooks and springs formed in this 
way are constant feeders of rivers and lakes. 
In regions where the land has been deforested, the rivers 
run low in season of prolonged drought, because the water 
which should have slowly seeped through the soil, and then 
supplied the rivers for weeks and months, ran off from the 
barren slopes in a few days. 
Forests not only lessen the danger of floods, but they con- 
serve our waterways, preventing a dangerous high-water 
mark in the season of heavy rains and melting snows, and 
then preventing a shrinkage in dry seasons when the only 
feeders of the rivers are the underground sources. In the 
summer of 1911, prolonged drought in North Carolina low- 
ered the rivers to such an extent that towns dependent upon 
them suffered greatly. The city of Charlotte was reduced 
for a time to a practically empty reservoir; washing and 
bathing were eliminated, machinery dependent upon water- 
power and steam stood idle, and every glass of water drunk 
was carefully reckoned. Thousands of gallons of water were 
brought in tanks from neighboring cities, and were emptied 
into the empty reservoir from whence it trickled slowly 
through the city mains. The lack of water caused not only 
personal inconvenience and business paralysis, but it occa- 
sioned real danger of disease through unflushed sewers and 
insufficiently drained pipes. 
The conservation of the forest means the conservation of 
our waterways, whether these be used for transportation or 
as sources of drinking water.

showed that cotton fabrics soaked in caustic soda assumed 
under certain conditions a silky sheen, and when dyed took 
on beautiful and varied hues. The demonstration of this 
simple fact laid the foundation for the manufacture of a vast 
variety of attractive dress materials known as mercerized 
cotton. 
Possibly no industry has been more affected by chemical 
discovery than that of dyeing. Those of us who have seen 
_ the old masterpieces in painting, or reproductions of them, 
know the softness, the mellowness, the richness of tints em- 
ployed by the old masters. But if we look for the brilliancy 
and variety of color seen in our own day, the search will be 
fruitless, because these were unknown until a half century 
ago. Up to that time, dyes were few in number and were 
extracted solely from plants, principally from the indigo and 
madder plants. But about the year 1856 it was discovered 
that dyes in much greater variety and in purer form could 
be obtained from coal tar. This chemical production of dyes 
has now largely supplanted the original method, and the in- 
dustry has grown so rapidly that a single firm produced in

one year from coal tar a quantity of indigo dye which under 
the natural process of plant extraction would have required 
a quarter million acres of indigo plant. 
The abundance and cheapness of newspapers, coarse 
wrapping papers, etc., is due to the fact that man has learned 
to substitute wood for rags in the manufacture of paper. In- 
vestigation brought out the fact that wood contained the sub- 
stance which made rags valuable for paper making. Since 
the supply of rags was far less than the demand, the problem 
of the extraction from wood of the paper-forming substance 
was a vital one. From repeated trials, it was found that 
caustic soda when heated with wood chips destroyed every- 
thing in the wood except the desired substance, cellulose ; 
this could be removed, bleached, dried, and pressed into 
paper. The substitution of wood for rags has made possible 
the daily issue of newspapers, for the making of which suffi- 
cient material would not otherwise have been available. 
When we reflect that a daily paper of wide circulation con- 
sumes ten acres of wood lot per day, we see that all the 
rags in the world would be inadequate to meet this demand 
alone, to say nothing of periodicals, books, tissue paper, etc. 
Chemistry plays a part in every phase of life; in the arts, 
the industries, the household, and in the body itself, where 
digestion, excretion, etc., result from the action of the bodily 
fluids upon food. The chemical substances of most interest 
to us are those which affect us personally rather than indus- 
trially; for example, soap, which cleanses our bodies, our 
clothing, our household possessions; washing soda, which 
lightens laundry work; lye, which clears out the drain pipe 
clogged with grease; benzine, which removes stains from 
clothing; turpentine, which rids us of paint spots left by 
careless workmen; and hydrogen peroxide, which disinfects 
wounds and sores. 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  220 MAN'S CONQUEST OF SUBSTANCES 
In order to understand the action of several of these sub- 
stances we must study the properties of two groups of chemi- 
cals — known respectively as acids and bases; the first of 
these may be represented by vinegar, sulphuric acid, and 
oxalic acid; and the second, by ammonia, lye, and limewater. 
202. Acids. All of us know that vinegar and lemon juice 
have a sour taste, and it is easy to show that most acids are 
characterized by a sour taste. If a clean glass rod is dipped 
into very dilute acid, such as acetic, sulphuric, or nitric acid, 
and then lightly touched to the tongue, it will taste sour. But 
the best test of an acid is by sight rather than by taste, be- 
cause it has been found that an acid is able to discolor a 
plant substance called litmus. If paper is soaked in a litmus 
solution until it acquires the characteristic blue hue of the 
plant substance, and is then dried thoroughly, it can be used 
to detect acids, because if it comes in contact with even the 
minutest trace of acid, it loses its blue color and assumes 
ared tint. Hence, in order to detect the presence of acid in 
a substance, one has merely to put some of the substance 
on blue. litmus paper, and note whether or not the latter 
changes color. This test shows that many of our common 
foods contain some acid; for example, fruit, buttermilk, sour 
bread, and vinegar. 
The damage which can be done by strong acids is well 
known; if a jar of sulphuric acid is overturned, and some of 
it falls on the skin, it eats its way into the flesh and leaves 
an ugly sore; if it falls on carpet or coat, it eats its way 
into the material and leaves an unsightly hole. The evil re- 
sults of an accident with acid can be lessened if we know 
just what to do and do it quickly, but for this we must have 
a knowledge of bases, the second group of chemicals. 
‘203. Bases. Substances belonging to this group usually 
have a bitter taste and a slimy, soapy feeling. For our present 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
BASES 221 
purposes, the most important characteristic of a base is that 
it will neutralize an acid and in some measure hinder the 
damage effected by the former. If, as soon as an acid has 
been spilled on cloth, a base, such as ammonia, is applied to 
the affected region, but little harm will be done. In your 
laboratory experiments you may be unfortunate enough to 
spill acid on your body or clothing; if so, quickly apply 
ammonia. If you delay, the acid does its work, and there is 
no remedy. If soda (a base) touches black material, it dis- 
colors it and leaves an ugly brown spot; but the application 
of a little acid, such as vinegar or lemon juice, will often 
restore the original color and counteract the bad effects of 
the base. Limewater prescribed by physicians in cases of ill- 
ness is a well-known base. This liquid neutralizes the too 
abundant acids present in a weak system and so quiets and 
tones the stomach. 
The interaction of acids and bases may be observed in 
another way. If blue litmus paper is put into an acid solu- 
tion, its color changes to red; if now the red litmus paper is 
dipped into a base solution, caustic soda, for example, its 
original color is partially restored. What the acid does, the 
base undoes, either wholly or in part. Bases always turn red 
litmus paper blue. 
Bases, like acids, are good or bad according to their use; if 
they come in contact with cloth, they eat or discolor it, unless 
neutralized by an acid. But this property of bases, harmful 
in one way, is put to advantage in the home, where grease is 
removed from drainpipe and sink by the application of lye, 
a strong base. If the lye is too concentrated, it will not only 
eat the grease, but will corrode the metal piping; it is easy, 
however, to dilute base solutions to such a degree that they 
will not affect piping, but will remove grease. Dilute am- 
monia is used in almost every home and is an indispensable
-P-A-G-E-222
    222 MAN'S CONQUEST OF SUBSTANCES 
domestic servant; diluted sufficiently, it is invaluable in the 
washing of delicate fabrics and in the removing of stains, and 
in a more concentrated form it is helpful as a smelling salt 
in cases of fainting. 
Some concentrated bases are so powerful in their action on 
grease, cloth, and metal that they have received the designa- 
tion caustic, and are ordinarily known as caustic soda, caustic 
potash (lye), and caustic lime. These more active bases are 
generally called alkalies in distinction from the less active ones. 
204. Neutral Substances. To any acid solution add grad- 
ually a small quantity of a base, and test the mixture from 
time to time with blue litmus paper ; at first the paper will turn 
red quickly, but as more and more of the base is added to the 
solution, it has less and less effect on the blue litmus paper, 
and finally a point is reached when a fresh strip of blue paper 
will not be affected. Such a result indicates infallibly the 
absence of any acid qualities in the solution. If now red litmus 
paper is tested in the same solution, its color also will remain 
unchanged; such a result indicates infallibly the absence of 
any basic quality. The solution has the characteristic property 
of neither acid nor base and is said to be neutral. 
If to the neutral solution an extra portion of base is added, 
so that there is an excess of base over acid, the neutralization 
is overbalanced and the red paper turns blue. If to the 
neutral solution an extra portion of acid is added, so that 
‘ there is an excess of acid over base, the neutralization is 
overbalanced in the opposite direction, and the solution ac- 
quires acid characteristics. 
Most acids and bases will eat and corrode and discolor, while 
neutral substances will not; it is for this reason that soap, a 
slightly alkaline substance, is the safest cleansing agent for 
laundry, bath, and general work. Good soaps, being care- 
fully made, are so nearly neutral that they will not fade the
-P-A-G-E-223
  
  SOAP 322 
color out of clothing ; the cheap soaps are less carefully pre- 
pared and are apt to have a strong excess of the base ingred- 
jent; such soaps are not safe for delicate work. 
205. Soap. If we gather together scrapings of lard, butter, 
bits of tallow from burned-out candles, scraps of waste fat, or 
any other sort of grease, and pour a strong solution of lye over 
the mass, a soft soapy substance is formed. In colonial 
times, every family made its own supply of soap, utilizing, 
for that purpose, household scraps often regarded by the 
housekeeper of to-day as worthless. Grease and fat were 
boiled with water and hardwood ashes, which are rich in lye, 
and from the mixture came the soft soap used by our an- 
cestors. In practice, the wood ashes were boiled in water, 
which was then strained off, and the resulting filtrate, or lye, 
was mixed with the fats for soap making. 
Most fats contain a substance of an 
acid nature, and are decomposed by the 
action of bases such as caustic soda and 
‘caustic potash. The acid component of 
the grease partially neutralizes the base, 
and a new substance is formed, namely, 
soap. 
With the advance of civilization the 
labor of soap making passed from the 
home to the factory, very much as bread 
making has done in our own day. Dif- 
ferent varieties of soaps appeared, of 
which the hard soap was the most popu- 
lar, owing to the ease with whichitcould F!6._157-—Liquid soap 
be transported. Within the last few ae 
years liquid soaps have come into favor, especially in schools, 
railroad,stations, and other public places, where a cake of 
soap would be handled by many persons. By means of a 
   
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 MAN'S CONQUEST OF SUBSTANCES 
simple device (Fig. 157), the soap escapes from a receptacle 
when needed. The mass of the soap does not come in con- 
tact with the skin, and hence the spread of contagious skin 
diseases is lessened. 
Commercial soaps are made from a great variety of sub- 
stances, such as tallow, lard, castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil, 
etc.; or in cheaper soaps, from rosin, cottonseed oil, and 
waste grease. The fats which go to waste in our garbage 
could be made a source of income, not only to the housewife, 
but to the city. In Columbus, Ohio, garbage is used as a 
source of revenue; the grease from the garbage being sold 
for soap making, and the tankage (Section 188) for fertilizer. 
206. Why Soap Cleans. The natural oil of the skin 
catches and retains dust and dirt, and makes a greasy film 
over the body. This cannot be removed by water alone, but 
if soap is used and a generous lather is applied to the skin, 
the dirt is “cut” and passes from the body into the water. 
Soap affects a grease film and water very much as the white of 
an egg affects oil and water. These two liquids alone do not 
mix, the oil remaining separate on the surface of the water ; 
but if a small quantity of white of egg is added, an emulsion is 
formed, the oil separating into minute droplets which spread 
through the water. In the same way, soap acts on a grease 
film, separating it into minute droplets which leave the skin and 
spread through the water, carrying with them the dust and dirt 
particles. The warmer the water, the better will be the emul- 
sion, and hence the more effective the removal of dirt and 
grease. This explanation holds true for the removal of 
grease from any surface, whether of the body, clothing, 
furniture, or dishes. 
"207. Washing Powders. Sometimes soap refuses to form 
a lather and instead cakes and floats as a scum on ‘the top 
of the water; this is not the fault of the soap but of the
-P-A-G-E-225
| 
WASHING POWDERS : 225 
water. As water seeps through the soil or flows over the land, 
it absorbs and retains various soil constituents which modify 
its character and, in some cases, render it almost useless for 
household purposes. Most of us are familiar with the rain 
barrel of the country house, and know that the housewife 
prefers rain water for laundry and general work. Rain 
water, coming as it does from the clouds, is free from the 
chemicals gathered by ground water, and is hence practically 
pure. While foreign substances do not necessarily injure 
water for drinking purposes (Section 69), they are often of such 
a nature as to prevent soap from forming an emulsion, and 
hence from doing its work. Under such circumstances the 
water is said to be hard, and soap used with it is wasted. 
Even if water is only moderately hard, much soap is lost. ! 
The substances which make water hard are calcium and mag- , 
nesium salts. When soap is put into water containing one or 
both of these, it combines with the salts to form sticky insolu- 
ble scum. Itis therefore not free to form an emulsion and to 
remove grease. As a cleansing agent it is valueless. The 
average city supply contains so little hardness that it is satis- 
factory for toilet purposes; but in the laundry, where there is 
need for the full effect of the soap, and where the slightest 
loss would aggregate a great deal in the course of time, some- 
thing must be done to counteract the hardness. The addition 
of soda, or sodium carbonate to the water will usually produce 
the desired effect. Washing soda combines with calcium and 
magnesium and prevents them from uniting with soap. The 
soap is thus free to form an emulsion, just as in ordinary 
water. Washing powders are sometimes used instead of wash- 
ing soda. Most washing powders contain, in addition to a 
softening agent, some alkali, and hence a double good is 
obtained from their use; they not only soften the water and 
allow the soap to form an emulsion, but they also, through 
CL. GEN, SCI.—1I5   
 
-P-A-G-E-226
    226 MAN'S CONQUEST OF SUBSTANCES 
their alkali content, cut the grease and themselves act as 
cleansers. In some cities where the water is very hard, as 
in Columbus, Ohio, it is softened and filtered at public ex- 
pense, before it leaves the reservoirs. But even under 
these circumstances, a moderate use of washing powder is 
general in laundry work. 
If washing powder is put on clothes dry, or is thrown into 
a crowded tub, it will eat the clothes before it has a chance 
to dissolve in the water. The only safe method is to dissolve 
the powder before the clothes are put into the tub. The 
trouble with our public laundries is that many of them are 
careless about this very fact, and do not take time to dissolve 
the powder before mixing it with the clothes. 
The strongest washing powder is soda, and this cheap form 
is as good as any of the more expensive preparations sold 
under fancy names. Borax is a milder powder and is desir- 
able for finer work. 
One of the most disagreeable consequences of the use of 
hard water for bathing is the unavoidable scum which forms 
on the sides of bathtub and washbowl. The removal of the 
caked grease is difficult, and if soap alone is used, the cleaning 
of the tub requires both patience and hard scrubbing. The 
labor can be greatly lessened by moistening the scrubbing 
cloth with turpentine and applying it to the greasy film, which 
immediately dissolves and thus can be easily removed. The 
presence of the scum can be largely avoided by adding a- 
small amount of liquid ammonia to the bath water. But 
many persons object to this; hence it is well to have some 
other easy method of removing the objectionable matter. 
208. To remove Stains from Cloth. While soap is, gener- 
ally speaking, the best cleansing agent, there are occasions 
when other substances can be used to better advantage. For 
example, grease spots on carpet and non-washable dress goods
-P-A-G-E-227
    SALTS 227 ‘ 
are best removed by the application of gasoline or benzine. 
These substances dissolve the grease, but do not remove it 
from the clothing; for that purpose a woolen cloth should be 
laid under the stain in readiness to absorb the benzine and the 
grease dissolved in it. If the grease is not absorbed while in 
solution, it remains in the clothing and after the evaporation 
of the benzine reappears in full force. 
Cleaners frequently clean suits by laying a blotter over a 
grease spot and applying a hot iron; the grease, when melted 
by the heat, takes the easiest way of spreading itself and 
passes from cloth to blotter. 
209. Salts. A neutral liquid formed as in Section 204, by 
the action of hydrochloric acid and the alkali solution of caus- 
tic soda, has a brackish, salty taste, and is, in fact, a solution 
of salt. This can be demonstrated by evaporating the. 
neutral liquid to dryness and examining the residue of solid 
matter, which proves to be common salt. 
When an acid is mixed with a base, the result is a sub- 
stance more or less similar in its properties to common salt; 
for this reason all compounds formed by the neutralization of 
an acid with a base are called salts. If, instead of hydro- 
chloric acid (HCl), we use an acid solution of potassium 
tartrate, and if instead of caustic soda we use bicarbonate 
of soda (baking soda), the result is a brackish liquid as be- 
fore, but the salt in the liquid is not common salt, but Rochelle 
salt. Different combinations of acids and bases produce 
different salts. Of all the vast group of salts, the most 
abundant as well as the most important is common salt, 
known technically as sodium chloride because of its two con- 
stituents, sodium and chlorine. 
We are not dependent upon neutralization for the enor- 
mous quantities of salt used in the home and in commerce. 
It is from the active, restless seas of the present, and from 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  228 MAN’S CONQUEST OF SUBSTANCES 
the dead seas of the prehistoric past that our vast stores of 
salt come. The waters of the Mediterranean and of our own 
Great Salt Lake are led into shallow basins, where, after 
evaporation by the heat of the sun, they leave a residue of 
salt. By far the largest quantity of salt, however, comes 
from the seas which no longer exist, but which in far remote 
ages dried up and left behind them their burden of salt. 
Deposits of salt formed in this way are found scattered 
throughout the world, and in our own country are found in 
greatest abundance in New York. The largest salt deposit 
known has a depth of one mile and exists in Germany. 
Salt is indispensable on our table and in our kitchen, but 
the amount of salt used in this way is far too small to account 
for a yearly consumption of 4,000,000 tons in the United 
States alone. The manufacture of soap, glass, bleaching 
powders, baking powders, washing soda, and other chemicals 
depends on salt, and it is for these that the salt beds are mined. 
210. Baking Soda. Salt is by all odds the most important 
sodium compound. Next to it come the so-called carbon- 
ates: first, sodium carbonate, which is already familiar to us 
as washing soda; and second, sodium bicarbonate, which is 
an ingredient of baking powders. These are both obtained 
from sodium chloride by relatively simple means; that is, by 
treating salt with the base, ammonia, and with carbon dioxide. 
Washing soda has already been discussed. Since baking 
powders in some form are used in almost all homes for the 
raising of cake and pastry dough, it is essential that their 
helpful and harmful qualities be clearly understood. 
The raising of dough by means of baking soda — bicarbon- 
ate of soda—isa very simple process. When soda is heated, 
it gives off carbon dioxide gas; you can easily prove this for 
yourself by burning a little soda in a test tube, and testing 
the escaping gas in a test tube of limewater. When flour and
-P-A-G-E-229
  BAKING POWDERS 229 
water alone are kneaded and baked in loaves, the result is a 
mass so compact and hard that human teeth are almost 
powerless to crush and chew it. The problem is to separate 
the mass of dough or, in other words, to cause it to rise and 
lighten. This can be done by mixing a little soda in the 
flour, because the heat of the oven causes the soda to give off 
bubbles of gas, and these in expanding make the heavy mass 
slightly porous. Bread is never lightened with soda because 
the amount of gas thus given off is too small to convert 
heavy compact bread dough into a spongy mass; but biscuit 
and cake, being by nature less compact and heavy, are suf- 
ficiently lightened by the gas given off from soda. 
But there is one great objection to the use of soda alone 
as a leavening agent. After baking soda has lost its carbon 
dioxide gas, it is no longer baking soda, but is transformed 
into its relative, washing soda, which has a disagreeable taste 
and is by no means desirable for the stomach. 
Man’s knowledge of chemicals and their effect on each 
other has enabled him to overcome this difficulty and, at the 
same time, to retain the leavening effect of the baking soda. 
211. Baking Powders. If some cooking soda is put into 
lemon juice or vinegar, or any acid, bubbles of gas immedi- 
ately form and escape from the liquid. After the efferves- 
cence has ceased, a taste of the liquid will show you that the 
lemon juice has lost its acid nature, and has acquired in 
exchange a salty taste. Baking soda, when treated with an 
acid, is transformed into carbon dioxide anda salt. The various 
baking powders on the market to-day consist of baking soda 
and some acid substance, which acts upon the soda, forces it 
to give up its gas, and at the same time unites with the resi- 
due to form a harmless salt. 
Cream of tartar contains sufficient acid to act on baking 
soda, and is a convenient and safe ingredient for baking pow- 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 MAN'S CONQUEST OF SUBSTANCES 
der. When soda and cream of tartar are mixed dry, they do 
not react on each other, neither do they combine rapidly in 
cold moist dough, but as soon as the heat of the oven pene- 
trates the doughy mass, the cream of tartar combines with 
the soda and sets free the gas needed to raise the dough. 
The gas expands with the heat of the oven, raising the dough 
still more. Meanwhile, the dough itself is influenced by the 
heat and is stiffened to such an extent that it retains its in- 
flated shape and spongy nature. 
Many housewives look askance at ready-made baking pow- 
ders and prefer to bake with soda and sour milk, soda and 
buttermilk, or soda and cream of tartar. Sour milk and butter- 
milk are quite as good as cream of tartar, because the lactic 
acid which they contain combines with the soda and liber- 
ates carbon dioxide, and forms a harmless residue in the 
dough. 
The desire of manufacturers to produce cheap baking 
powders led to the use of cheap acids and alkalies, regardless 
of the character of the resulting salt. Alum and soda were 
popular for some time; but careful examination proved that 
the particular salt produced by this combination was not 
readily absorbed by the stomach, and that its retention there 
was injurious to health. For this reason, many states have 
prohibited the use of alum in baking powders. 
It is not only important to choose the ingredients carefully ; 
it is also necessary to calculate the respective quantities of 
each, otherwise there will be an excess of acid or alkali for 
the stomach to take care of. A standard powder contains 
twice as much cream of tartar as of bicarbonate of soda, and 
the thrifty housewife who wishes to economize, can make for 
herself, at small cost, as good a baking powder as any on the 
market, by mixing tartar and soda in the above proportions 
and adding a little corn starch to keep the mixture dry.
-P-A-G-E-231
    SODA MINTS 231 
The self-raising flour, so widely advertised by grocers, is 
flour in which these ingredients or their equivalent have been 
mixed by the manufacturer. 
212. Soda Mints. Bicarbonate of soda is practically the sole 
ingredient of the soda mints popularly sold for indigestion. 
These correct a tendency to sour stomach because they 
counteract the surplus acid in the stomach, and form with it 
a safe neutral substance. 
Seidlitz powder is a simple remedy consisting of two pow- 
ders, one containing bicarbonate of soda, and the other, some 
acid such as cream of tartar. When these substances are 
dissolved in water and mixed, effervescence occurs, carbon 
dioxide escapes, and a solution of Rochelle salt remains. 
212a. Source of Soda. An enormous quantity of sodium 
carbonate, or soda, as it is usually called, is needed in the 
manufacture of glass, soap, bleaching powders, and other 
commercial products. Formerly, the supply of soda was very 
limited because man was dependent upon natural deposits 
and upon ashes of sea plants for it. Common salt, sodium 
chloride, is abundant, and in 1775 a prize was offered to any 
one who would find a way to obtain soda from salt. Asa 
result of this, soda was soon manufactured from common salt. 
In the most recent methods of manufacture, salt, water, am- 
monia, and carbon dioxide are made to react. Baking soda 
is formed from the reaction. The baking soda is then heated 
and decomposed into washing soda or the soda of commerce,
-P-A-G-E-232
  CHAPTER: XI 
FERMENTATION 
213. While baking powder is universally used for biscuits 
and cake, it is seldom, if ever, used for bread, because it 
does not furnish sufficient gas to lighten the tough heavy 
mass of bread dough. Then, too, most people prefer the 
taste of yeast-raised bread. There is a reason for this wide- 
spread preference, but to understand it, we must go some- 
what far afield, and must study not only the bread of to-day, 
but the bread of antiquity, and the wines as well. 
If grapes are crushed, they yield a liquid which tastes 
like the grapes; but if the liquid is allowed to stand in a warm 
place, it loses its original character, and begins to ferment, 
becoming, in the course of a few weeks, a strongly intoxicat- 
_ing drink. This is true not only of grape juice but also of 
the juice of all other sweet fruits; apple juice ferments to 
cider, currant juice to currant wine, etc. This phenomenon 
of fermentation is known to practically all races of men, and 
there is scarcely a savage tribe without some kind of fer- 
mented drink; in the tropics the fermented juice of the palm 
tree serves for wine; in the desert regions, the fermented 
juice of the century plant; and in still other regions, the root 
of the ginger plant is pressed into service. 
The fermentation which occurs in bread making is similar 
to that which is responsible for the transformation of plant 
juices into intoxicating drinks. The former process is not so 
232
-P-A-G-E-233
  THE BREAD OF ANTIQUITY 233 
old, however, since the use of alcoholic beverages dates back 
to the very dawn of history, and the authentic record of 
raised or leavened bread is but little more than 3000 years 
old. 
214. The Bread of Antiquity. The original method of 
bread making and the method employed by savage tribes of 
to-day is to mix crushed grain and water until a paste is 
formed, and then to bake this over a camp fire. The result 
is a hard compact substance known as unleavened bread. 
A considerable improvement over this tasteless mass is 
self-raised bread. If dough is left standing in a warm place 
a number of hours, it swells up with gas and becomes porous, 
and when baked, is less compact and hard than the savage 
bread. Exposure to air and warmth brings about changes in 
dough as well as in fruit juices, and alters the character of 
the dough and the bread made from it. Bread made in this 
way would not seem palatable to civilized man of the present 
day, accustomed, as he is, to delicious bread made light and 
porous by yeast; but to the ancients, the least softening and 
lightening was welcome, and self-fermented bread, therefore, 
supplanted the original unleavened bread. 
Soon it was discovered that a pinch of this fermented dough 
acted as a starter on a fresh batch of dough. Hence, a little 
of the fermented dough was carefully saved from a batch, 
and when the next bread was made, the fermented dough, or 
leaven, was worked into the fresh dough and served to raise 
the mass more quickly and effectively than mere exposure to 
air and warmth could do in the same length of time. This 
use of leaven for raising bread has been practiced for ages. 
Grape juice mixed with millet ferments quickly and 
strongly, and the Romans learned to use this mixture for 
bread raising, kneading a very small amount of it through 
the dough. 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
    234 FERMENTATION 
215. The Cause of Fermentation. Although alcoholic 
fermentation, and the fermentation which goes on in raising 
dough, were known and utilized for many years, the cause of 
the phenomenon was a sealed book until the nineteenth 
century. About that time it was discovered, through the 
use of the microscope, that fermenting liquids contain an 
army of minute plant organisms which not only live there, 
but which actually grow and multiply within the liquid. 
For growth and multiplication, food is necessary, and this the 
tiny plants get in abundance from the fruit juices; they feed 
upon the sugary matter and as they feed, they ferment it, 
changing it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. The carbon di- 
oxide, in the form of small bubbles, passes off from the fer- 
menting mass, while the alcohol remains in the liquid, giving 
the stimulating effect desired by imbibers of alcoholic drinks. 
The unknown strange organisms were called yeast, and they 
were the starting point of the yeast cakes and yeast brews 
manufactured to-day on a large scale, not only for bread 
making but for the commercial production of beer, ale, por- 
ter, and other intoxicating drinks. 
The grains, rye, corn, rice, wheat, from which meal is 
made, contain only a small quantity of sugar, but, on the 
other hand, they contain a large quantity of starch which is 
easily convertible into sugar. Upon this the tiny yeast 
plants in the dough feed, and, as in the case of the wines, 
ferment the sugar, producing carbon dioxide and alcohol. 
The dough is thick and sticky and the gas bubbles expand 
it into a spongy mass. The tiny yeast plants multiply and 
continue to make alcohol and gas, and in consequence, the 
dough becomes lighter and lighter. When it has risen suf- 
ficiently, it is kneaded and placed in an oven; the heat of the 
oven soon kills the yeast plants and drives the alcohol out of 
the bread; at the same time it expands the imprisoned gas

  WHERE DOES YEAST COME FROM? 235 
bubbles and causes them to lighten and swell the bread still 
more. Meanwhile, the dough has become stiff enough to sup- 
port itself. The result of the fermentation is a light, spongy 
loaf. 
216. Where does Yeast come From? The microscopic 
plants which we call yeast are widely distributed in the air, and 
float around there until chance brings them in contact with a 
substance favorable to their growth, such as fruit juices and 
moist warm batter. Under the favorable conditions of abun- 
dant moisture, heat, and food, they grow and multiply rapidly, 
and cause the phenomenon of fermentation, Wild yeast 
settles on the skin of grapes and apples, but since it does not 
have access to the fruit juices within, it remains inactive 
very much as a seed does before it is planted. But when the 
fruit is crushed, the yeast plants get into the juice, and feed- 
ing on it, grow and multiply. The stray yeast plants which 
get into the sirup are relatively few, and hence fermentation 
is slow; it requires several weeks for currant wine to ferment, 
and several months for the juice of grapes to be converted 
into wine. 
Stray yeast finds a favorable soil for growth in the warmth 
and moisture of a batter; but although the number of these 
stray plants is very large, it is insufficient to cause rapid 
fermentation, and if we depended upon wild yeast for bread 
raising, the result would not be to our liking. 
When our remote ancestors saved a pinch of dough as 
leaven for the next baking, they were actually cultivating 
yeast, although they did not know it. The reserved portion 
served as a favorable breeding place to the yeast plants within 
it; they grew and reproduced amazingly, and became so 
numerous, that the small mass of old dough in which they 
were gathered served to leaven the entire batch at the next 
baking.
-P-A-G-E-236
    236 FERMENTATION 
As soon as man learned that yeast plants caused fermenta- 
tion in liquors and bread, he realized that it would be to his 
advantage to cultivate yeast and to add it to bread and to’ 
plant juices rather than to depend upon accidental and slow 
fermentation from wild yeast. Shortly after the discovery of 
yeast in the nineteenth century, man commenced his attempt 
to cultivate the tiny organisms. Their microscopic size added 
greatly to his trouble, and it was only after years of careful 
and tedious investigation that he was able to perfect the 
commercial yeast cakes and yeast brews universally used by 
bakers and brewers. The well-known compressed yeast cake 
is simply a mass of live and vigorous yeast plants, embedded in 
a soft, soggy material, and ready to grow and multiply as soon 
as they are placed under proper conditions of heat, moisture, 
and food. Seeds which remain on our shelves do not germi- 
nate, ‘put those which are planted in the soil do; so it is with 
the yeast plants. While in the cake they are as lifeless as 
the seed; when placed in dough, or fruit juice, or grain water, 
they grow and multiply and cause fermentation.

  CHAPTER XXII 
BLEACHING 
217. The beauty and the commercial value of uncolored 
fabrics depend upon the purity and perfection of their white- 
ness; a man’s white collar and a woman’s white waist must 
be pure white, without the slightest tinge of color. But all 
natural fabrics, whether they come from plants, like cotton 
and linen, or from animals, like wool and silk, contain more 
or less coloring matter, which impairs the whiteness. This 
coloring not only detracts from the appearance of fabrics 
which are to be worn uncolored, but it seriously interferes with 
the action of dyes, and at times plays the dyer strange tricks. 
Natural fibers, moreover, are difficult to spin and weave 
unless some softening material such as wax or resin is rubbed 
lightly over them. The matter added to facilitate spinning 
and weaving generally detracts from the appearance of the 
uncolored fabric, and also interferes with successful dyeing. 
Thus it is easy to see that the natural coloring matter and the 
added foreign matter must be entirely removed from fabrics 
destined for commercial use. Exceptions to this general fact 
are sometimes made, because unbleached material is cheaper 
and more durable than the bleached product, and for some 
purposes is entirely satisfactory ; unbleached cheesecloth and 
sheeting are frequently purchased in place of the more 
expensive bleached material. Formerly, the only bleaching 
agent known was the sun’s rays, and linen and cotton were 
237 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 BLEACHING 
put out to sun for a week; that is, the unbleached fabrics 
were spread on the grass and exposed to the bleaching action 
of sun and dew. ; 
218. An Artificial Bleaching Agent. While the sun’s rays 
are effective as a bleaching agent, the process is slow; more- 
over, it would be impossible to expose to the sun’s rays the 
vast quantity of fabrics used in the civilized world of to-day, 
and the huge and numerous bolts of material which daily 
come from our looms and factories must therefore be whitened 
by artificial means. The substance almost universally used as a 
rapid artificial bleaching agent is chlorine, best known to us as a 
constituent of common salt. Chlorine is never free in nature, 
but is found in com- 
bination with other 
substances, as, for 
example, in combina- 
tion with sodium in 
salt, or with hydrogen 
in hydrochloric acid. 
The best laboratory 
method of securing | 
free chlorine is to 
heat in a water bath a 
mixture of hydrochlo- 
ric acid and manganese 
dioxide, a compound 
containing one part of 
manganese and two 
parts of oxygen. The 
Fic. 158.— Preparing chlorine from hydrochloric heat causes the man- 
acid and manganese dioxide, 
  ganese dioxide to give 
up its oxygen, which immediately combines with the hydro- 
gen of the hydrochloric acid and forms water. The man-
-P-A-G-E-239
  
  BLEACHING POWDER 239 
ganese itself combines with part of the chlorine originally 
in the acid, but not with all. There is thus some free chlo- 
rine left over from the acid, and this passes off. as a gas 
and can be collected, as in Figure 158. Free chlorine is 
heavier than air, and hence when it leaves the exit tube it 
settles at the bottom of the jar, displacing the air, and finally 
filling the bottle. 
Chlorine is a very active, substance and combines readily 
with most substances, but especially with hydrogen; if 
chlorine comes in contact with steam, it abstracts the hydro- 
gen and unites with it to form hydrochloric acid, but it leaves 
the oxygen free and uncombined. This tendency of chlorine 
to combine with hydrogen makes it valuable as a bleaching 
agent. In order to test the efficiency of chlorine as a bleagh- 
ing agent, drop a wet piece of colored gingham or calico into 
the bottle of chlorine, and notice the rapid disappearance of 
color from the sample. If unbleached muslin is used, the 
moist strip loses its natural yellowish hue and becomes a 
clear, pure white. The explanation of the bleaching power 
of chlorine is that the chlorine combines with the hydrogen 
of the water and sets oxygen free; the uncombined free 
oxygen oxidizes the coloring matter in the cloth and destroys it. 
Chlorine has no effect on dry material, as may be seen if 
we put dry gingham into the jar; in this case there is no 
water to furnish hydrogen for combination with the chlorine, 
and no oxygen to be set free. 
219. Bleaching Powder. Chlorine gas has a very injurious 
effect on the human body, and hence cannot be used directly 
as a bleaching agent. It attacks the mucous membrarie 
of the nose and lungs,.and produces the effect of a severe 
cold or catarrh, and when inhaled, causes death. But certain 
compounds of chlorine are harmless, and can be used instead 
of chlorine for destroying either natural or artificial dyes.
-P-A-G-E-240
240 BLEACHING 
One of these compounds, namely, chloride of lime, is the 
almost universal bleaching agent of commerce. It comes in 
the form of powder, which can be dissolved in water to form 
| the bleaching solution in which the colored fabrics are im- 
| mersed. But fabrics immersed in a bleaching powder solution 
do not lose their color as would naturally be expected. The 
reason for this is that the chlorine gas is not free to do its 
work, but is restricted by its combination with the other sub- 
stances. By experiment it has been found that the addition 
to the bleaching solution of an acid, such as vinegar or lemon 
juice or sulphuric acid, causes the liberation of the chlorine. 
The chlorine thus set free reacts with the water and liberates 
oxygen; this in turn destroys the coloring matter in the fibers, 
and transforms the material into a bleached product. 
The acid used to liberate the chlorine from the bleaching 
powder, and the chlorine also, rot materials with which they 
remain in contact for any length of time. For this reason, 
fabrics should be removed from the bleaching solution as 
soon as possible, and should then be rinsed in some solution, 
such as ammonia, which is capable of neutralizing the harm- 
ful substances; finally the fabric should be thoroughly rinsed 
in water in order that all foreign matter may be removed. 
The reason home bleaching is so seldom satisfactory is that 
most amateurs fail to realize the necessity of immediate 
neutralization and rinsing, and allow the fabric to remain too 
long in the bleaching solution, and allow it to dry with traces 
of the bleaching substances present in the fibers. Material 
treated in this way is thoroughly bleached, but is at the same 
time rotten and worthless. Chloride of lime is frequently 
used in laundry work; the clothes are whiter than when 
cleaned with soap and simple washing powders, but they 
“soon wear out unless the precaution has been taken to add an 
“antichlor”’ or neutralizer to the bleaching solution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  WOOL AND SILK BLEACHING 241 
220. Commercial Bleaching. In commercial bleaching the 
material to be bleached is first moistened with a very weak 
solution of sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid, and is then 
immersed in the bleaching powder solution. As the moist 
material is drawn through the bleaching solution, the acid on 
the fabric acts upon the solution and releases chlorine. The 
chlorine liberates oxygen from the water. The oxygen in 
turn attacks the coloring matter and destroys it. 
The bleached material is then immersed in a neutralizing 
bath and is finally rinsed thoroughly in water. Strips of 
cotton or linen many miles long are drawn by machinery into 
and out of the various solutions (Fig. 159), are then passed

bleaching solution }, and finally through a neutralizing solution c. 
over pressing rollers, and emerge snow white, ready to be 
dyed or to be used as white fabric. 
221. Wool and Silk Bleaching. Animal fibers like silk, wool, 
and feathers, and some vegetable fibers like straw, cannot be 
bleached by means of chlorine, because it attacks not only the 
coloring matter but the fiber itself, and leaves it shrunken 
and inferior. Cotton and linen fibers, apart from the small 
amount of coloring matter present in them, contain nothing 
but carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, while animal fibers con- 
tain in addition to these elements some compounds of nitro- 
gen. The presence of these nitrogen compounds influences 
the action of the chlorine and produces unsatisfactory results. 
For animal fibers it is therefore necessary to discard chlorine 
CL. GEN, SCI. — 16 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  »242 BLEACHING 
as a bleaching agent, and to substitute a substance which will 
have a less disastrous action upon the fibers. Such a sub- 
stance is to be had in sulphurous acid. When sulphur burns, 
as in a match, it gives off disagreeable fumes, and if these 
are made to bubble into a vessel containing water, they dis- 
solve and form with the water a substance known as sul- 
phurous acid. That this solution has bleaching properties is 
shown by the fact that a colored cloth dipped into it loses its 
color, and unbleached fabrics immersed in it are whitened. 
The harmless nature of sulphurous acid makes it very desir- 
able as a bleaching agent, especially in the home. 
Silk, lace, and wool when bleached with chlorine become 
hard and brittle, but when whitened with sulphurous acid, 
they retain their natural characteristics. 
This mild form of a bleaching substance has been put to 
uses which are now prohibited by the pure food laws. In 
some canneries common corn is whitened with sulphurous 
acid, and is then sold under false representations. Cherries 
are sometimes bleached and then colored with the bright 
shades which under natural conditions indicate freshness. 
Bleaching with chlorine is permanent, the dyestuff being 
destroyed by the chlorine; but bleaching with sulphurous acid 
is temporary, because the milder bleach does not actually de- 
stroy the dyestuff, but merely modifies it, and in time the natu- 
ral yellow color of straw, cotton, and linen reappears. The 
yellowing of straw hats during the summer is familiar to every 
one; the straw is merely resuming its natural color which had 
been modified by the sulphurous acid solution applied to the 
straw when woven. 
222. Why the Color Returns. Some of the compounds 
formed by the sulphurous acid bleaching process are gradu- 
ally decomposed by sunlight, and in consequence the original 
color is in time partially restored. The portion of a hat pro-
-P-A-G-E-243
    
THE REMOVAL OF STAINS 243 
tected by the band retains its fresh appearance because the 
light has not had access to it. Silks and other fine fabrics 
bleached in this way fade with age, and assume an unnatural 
color. One reason for this is that the dye used to color the 
fabric requires a clear white background, and loses its charac- 
teristic hues when its foundation is yellow instead of white. 
Then, too, dyestuffs are themselves more or less affected by 
light, and fade slowly under a strong illumination. 
Materials which are not exposed directly to an intense and 
prolonged illumination retain their whiteness for a long time, 
and hence dress materials and hats which have been bleached 
with sulphurous acid should be protected from the sun’s glare 
when not in use. 
223. The Removal of Stains. Bleaching powder is very 
useful in the removal of stains from white fabrics. Ink spots 
rubbed with lemon juice and dipped in bleaching solution 
fade away and leave on the cloth no trace of discoloration. 
Sometimes these stains can be removed by soaking in milk, 
and where this is possible, it is the better method. 
Bleaching solution, however, while valuable in the removal 
of some stains, is unable to remove paint stains, because paints 
owe their color to mineral matter, and on this chlorine is 
powerless to act. Paint stains are best removed by the ap- 
plication of gasoline followed by soap and water. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  CHAPTER XXIII 
DYEING | 
224. Dyes. One of the most important and lucrative in- 
dustrial processes of the world to-day is that of staining and 
dyeing. Whether we consider the innumerable shades of 
leather used in shoes and harnesses and upholstery ; the mul- 
titude of colors in the paper which covers our walls and re- 
flects light ranging from the somber to the gay, and from 
the delicate to the gorgeous; the artificial scenery which 
adorns the stage and by its imitation of trees and flowers 
and sky translates us to the Forest of Arden; or whether 
we consider the uncounted varieties of color in dress ma- 
terials, in carpets, and in hangings, we are dealing with sub- 
stances which owe their beauty to dyes and dyestuffs. 
The coloring of textile fabrics, such as cotton, wool, and 
silk, far outranks in amount and importance that of leather, 
paper, etc., and hence the former only will be considered 
here; but the theories and facts relative to textile dyeing are 
' applicable in a general way to all other forms as well. 
225. Plants as a Source of Dyes. Among the most beauti- 
ful examples of man’s handiwork are the baskets and blankets 
of the North American Indians, woven with a skill which 
cannot be equaled by manufacturers, and dyed in mellow 
colors with a few simple dyes extracted from local plants. 
The magnificent rugs and tapestries of Persia and Turkey, 
and the silks of India and Japan, give evidence that a knowl- 
edge of dyes is widespread and ancient. Until recently, the
-P-A-G-E-245
  WOOL AND COTTON DYEING 245 
vegetable world was the source of practically all coloring 
matter, the pulverized root of the madder plant yielding the 
reds, the leaves and stems of the indigo plant the blues, the 
heartwood of the tropical logwood tree the blacks and grays, 
and the fruit of certain palm and locust trees yielding the 
soft browns. So great was the commercial demand for dye- 
stuffs that large areas of land were given over to the exclusive 
cultivation of the more important dye plants. Vegetable dyes 
are now, however, rarely used because about the year 1856 
it was discovered that dyes could be obtained from coal tar, 
the thick sticky liquid formed as a by-product in the manu- 
facture of coal gas. These artificial coal-tar, or aniline, dyes 
have practically undisputed sway to-day, and the vast areas 
of land formerly used for the cultivation of vegetable dyes 
are now free for other purposes. 
226. Wool and Cotton Dyeing. If a piece of wool is soaked 
in a solution of a coal-tar dye, such as magenta, the fiber 
of the cloth draws some of the dye out of the solution and 
absorbs it, becoming in consequence beautifully colored. The 
coloring matter becomes “part and parcel,” as it were, of 
the wool fiber, because repeated washing of the fabric fails to 
remove the newly acquired color; the magenta coloring matter 
unites chemically with the fiber of the wool, and forms with 
it a compound insoluble in water, and hence fast to washing. 
But if cotton is used instead of wool, the acquired color is 
very faint, and washes off readily. This is because cotton 
fibers possess no chemical substance capable of uniting with 
the coloring matter to form a compound insoluble in water. 
If magenta is replaced by other artificial dyes,— for example, 
scarlets, —the result is similar; in general, wool material ab- 
sorbs dye readily, and uniting with it is permanently dyed. 
Cotton material, on the other hand, does not combine chemically 
with coloring matter and therefore is only faintly tinged with  
-P-A-G-E-246
  | | 246 DYEING a 
  color, and loses this when washed. When silk and linen are 
tested, it is found that the former behaves in a general way 
as did wool, while the linen has more similarity to the cotton. 
That vegetable fibers, such as cotton and linen, should act 
differently toward coloring matter from animal fibers, such as 
silk and wool, is not surprising when we consider that the 
chemical nature of the two groups is very different ; vegetable 
fibers contain only oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen, while ani- 
mal fibers always contain nitrogen in addition, and in many 
cases sulphur as well. 
227. The Selection of Dyes. When silk and wool, ctl and 
linen, are tested in various dye solutions, it is found that the 
former have, in general, a great affinity for coloring matter 
and acquire a permanent color, but that cotton and linen, on 
the other hand, have little affinity for dyestuffs. The color 
acquired by vegetable fibers is, therefore, usually faint. 
There are, of course, many exceptions to the general state- 
ment that animal fibers dye readily and vegetable fibers poorly, 
because certain dyes fail utterly with woolen and silk material 
and yet are fairly satisfactory when applied to cotton and 
linen fabrics. Then, too, a dye which will color silk may not 
have any effect on wool in spite of the fact that wool, like 
silk, is an animal fiber; and certain dyestuffs to which cotton 
responds most beautifully are absolutely without cou on 
linen. 
The nature of the material to be dyed determines the color- 
ing matter to be used; in dyeing establishments a careful ex- 
amination is made of all textiles received for dyeing, and the 
particular dyestuffs are then applied which long experience 
has shown to be best suited to the material in question. 
Where “mixed goods,” such as silk and wool, or cotton and 
wool, are concerned, the problem is a difficult one, and the 
countless varieties of gorgeously colored mixed materials give 
|    
-P-A-G-E-247
HOW VARIETY OF COLOR 1S SECURED 247 
evidence of high perfection in ‘the art of dyeing and weav- 
ing. 
Housewives who wish to do successful home dyeing should 
therefore not purchase dyes indiscriminately, but should select 
the kind best suited to the material, because the coloring 
principle which will remake a silk waist may utterly ruin a 
woolen skirt or a linen suit. Powders designed for special 
purposes may be purchased from druggists. 
228. Indirect Dyeing. We have seen that it is practically 
impossible to color cotton and linen in a simple manner with 
any degree of permanency, because of the lack of chemical 
action between vegetable fibers and coloring matter. But 
the varied uses to which dyed articles are put make fastness 
of color absolutely necessary. A shirt, forexample, must not 
be discolored by perspiration, nor a waist faded by washing, 
nor a carpet dulled by sweeping with a dampened broom. 
In order to insure permanency of dyes, an indirect method was 
originated which consisted of adding to the fibers a chemical 
capable of acting upon the dye and forming with it a colored 
compound insoluble in water, and hence “safe.” For ex- 
ample, cotton material dyed directly in logwood solution has 
almost no value, but if it is soaked in a solution of oxalic acid 
and alum until it becomes saturated with the chemicals, and 
is then transferred to a logwood bath, the color acquired is 
fast and beautiful. 
This method of indirect dyeing is known as the mordanting 
process; it consists of saturating the fabric to be dyed with 
chemicals which will unite with the coloring matter to form 
compounds unaffected by water. The chemicals are called 
mordants. 
229. How Variety of Color is Secured. The color which is 
fixed on the fabric as a result of chemical action between mor- 
dant and dye is frequently very different from that of the dye
-P-A-G-E-248
Tt ey ten a | 
248 DYEING 
itself. Logwood dye when used alone produces a reddish 
brown color of no value either for beauty or permanence; 
but if the fabric to be dyed is first mordanted with a solution 
of alum and oxalic acid and is then immersed in a logwood 
bath, it acquires a beautiful blue color. | 
Moreover, since the color acquired depends upon the mor- 
dant as well as upon the dye, it is often possible to obtain a 
wide range of colors by varying the mordant used, the dye 
remaining the same. For example, with alum and oxalic acid 
as a mordant and logwood as a dye, blue is obtained; but 
with a mordant of ferric sulphate and a dye of logwood, 
blacks and grays result. Fabrics immersed directly in aliz- 
arin acquire a reddish yellow tint; when, however, they are 
mordanted with certain aluminium compounds they acquire 
a brilliant Turkey red, when mordanted with chromium com- 
pounds, a maroon, and when mordanted with iron compounds, 
the various shades of purple, lilac, and violet result. _ 
230. Color Designs in Cloth. It is thought that the earliest 
attempts at making “fancy materials” consisted in painting 
designs on a fabric by means of a brush. In more recent 
times the ,design was cut in relief on hard wood, the relief 
being then daubed with coloring matter and applied by hand 
to successive portions of the cloth. The most modern method 
of design-making is that of machine or roller printing. In 
this, the relief blocks are replaced by engraved copper rolls 
which rotate continuously and in the course of their rotation 
automatically receive coloring matter on the engraved por- 
tion. The cloth to be printed is then drawn uniformly over 
the rotating roll, receiving color from the engraved design; 
in this way, the .color pattern is automatically printed on 
the cloth with perfect regularity. In cases where the fabrics 
do not unite directly with the coloring matter, the design is 
supplied with a mordant and the impression made on the
-P-A-G-E-249
    COLOR DESIGNS 1N CLOTH 249 
fabric is that of the mordant; when the fabric is later trans- 
ferred to a dye bath, the mordanted portions, represented by 
the design, unite with the coloring matter and thus form the 
desired color patterns. 
Unless the printing is well done, the coloring matter does 
not thoroughly penetrate the material, and only a faint blurred 
design appears on the back of the cloth; the gaudy designs 
of cheap calicoes and ginghams often do not show at all on 
the under side. Such carelessly made prints are not fast to 
washing or light, and soon fade. But in the better grades of 
material the printing is well done, and the color designs are 
fairly fast, and a little care in the laundry suffices to eliminate 
any danger of fading. | 
Color designs of the greatest durability are produced by 
the weaving together of colored yarns. When yarn is dyed, 
the coloring matter penetrates to every part of the fiber, and 
hence the patterns formed by the weaving together of well- 
dyed yarns are very fast to light and water. 
If the color designs to be woven in the cloth are intricate, 
complex machinery is necessary and skillful handwork ; 
hence, patterns formed by the weaving of colored yarns are 
expensive and less common than printed fabrics.

  CHAPTER XXIV 
CHEMICALS AS DISINFECTANTS AND PRESERVATIVES 
231. The prevention of disease epidemics is one of the most 
striking achievements of modern science. Food, clothing, 
furniture, and other objects contaminated in any way by 
disease germs may be disinfected by chemicals or by heat, 
and widespread infection from persons suffering with a con- 
tagious disease may be prevented. 
When disease germs are within the body, the prouleed is 
far from simple, because chemicals which would effectively 
destroy the germs would be fatal to life itself. But when 
germs are outside the 
body, as in water or 
\ milk, or on clothing, 
os —Z dishes, or furniture, 
they can be easily 
} killed. One of the 
ee at best methods of de- 
| stroying germs is to 
| subject them to in- 
tense heat. Contam-

few minutes, because 
the strong heat destroys the disease-producing germs. 
Scalded or Pasteurized’ milk saves the lives of scores of 
babies, because the germs of summer complaint wich lurk 
250
-P-A-G-E-251
  PERSONAL DISINFECTION 251 
in poor milk are killed and rendered harmless in the process 
of scalding. Dishes used by consumptives, and persons suf- 
fering from contagious diseases, can be made harmless by 
thorough washing in thick suds of almost boiling water. 
The bedding and clothing of persons suffering with diph- 
theria, tuberculosis, and other germ diseases should always be 
boiled and hung to dry in the bright sunlight. Heat and sun- 
shine are two of the best disinfectants. 
232. Chemicals. Objects, such as furniture, which cannot 
be boiled, are disinfected by the use of any one of several 
chemicals, such as sulphur, carbolic acid, chloride of lime, 
corrosive sublimate, etc. 
One of the simplest methods of disinfecting consists in 
burning sulphur in a room whose doors, windows, and key- 
holes have been closed, so that the burning fumes cannot 
escape, but remain in the room long enough to destroy disease 
germs. This is probably the most common means of fumi- 
gation. 
For general purposes, carbolic acid is one of the very best 
disinfectants, but must be used with caution, as it is a deadly 
poison except when very dilute. 
Chloride of lime when exposed to the air and moisture slowly 
gives off chlorine, and can be used as a disinfectant because the 
gas thus set free attacks germs and destroys them. For this 
reason chloride of lime is an excellent disinfectant of drain- 
pipes. Certain bowel troubles, such as diarrhoea, are due to 
microbes, and if the waste matter of a person suffering from 
this or similar diseases is allowed passage through the drain- 
age system, much damage may be done. But a small amount 
of chloride of lime in the closet bowl will insure disinfection. 
233. Personal Disinfection. The hands may gather germs 
from any substances or objects with which they come in con- 
tact; hence the hands should be washed with soap and water,  
-P-A-G-E-252

| 
and especially before eating. Physicians who perform opera- 
tions wash not only their hands, but their instruments, steril- 
izing the latter by placing them in boiling water for several 
minutes. | 
Cuts and wounds allow easy access to the body; a small 
cut has been known to cause death because of the bacteria 
which found their way into the open wound and produced 
disease. In order to destroy any germs which may have 
entered into the cut from the instrument, it is well to wash out 
the wound with some mild disinfectant, such as very dilute 
carbolic acid or hydrogen peroxide, and then to bind the 
wound with a clean cloth, to prevent later entrance of germs. 
234. Chemicals as Food Preservatives. The spoiling of 
meats and soups, and the souring of milk and preserves, are 
due to germs which, like those producing disease, can be 
destroyed by heat and by chemicals. | 
Milk heated to the boiling point does not sour readily, and 
successful canning consists in cooking fruits and vegetables 
~ until all the germs are killed, and then sealing the cans so 
that germs from outside cannot find entrance and undo the 
work of the canner. : 
Some dealers and manufacturers have learned that certain 
chemicals will act as food preservatives, and hence they have 
replaced the safe method of careful canning by the quicker 
and simpler plan of adding chemicals to food. Catchup, 
sauces, and jellies are now frequently preserved in this way. 
But the chemicals which destroy bacteria frequently injure 
the consumer as well. And so much harm has been done 
by food preservatives that the pure food laws require that 
cans and bottles contain a labeled statement of the kind 
and quantity of chemicals used. I 
Even milk is not exempt, but is doctored to prevent sour- 
ing, the preservative most generally used by milk dealers
-P-A-G-E-253
    THE PRESERVATION OF WOOD AND METAL 253 
being formaldehyde. The vast quantity of milk consumed by 
young and old, sick and well, makes the use of formaldehyde 
a serious menace to health, because no constitution can endure 
the injury done by the constant use of preservatives. 
The most popular and widely used preservatives of meats 
are borax and boric acid. These chemicals not only arrest 
decay, but partially restore to old and bad meat the appear- 
ance of freshness; in this way unscrupulous dealers are able 
to sell to the public in one form or other meats which may 
have undergone partial decomposition; sausage frequently 
contains partially decomposed meat, restored as it were by 
chemicals. 
In jams and catchups there is abundant opportunity for 
preservatives; badly or partially decayed fruits are sometimes 
disinfected and used as the basis of foods sold by so-called 
good dealers. Benzoate of soda, and salicylic acid are the 
chemicals most widely employed for this purpose, with coal- 
tar dyes to simulate the natural color of the fruit. 
Many of the cheap candies sold by street venders are not fit 
for consumption, since they are not only made of bad material, 
but are frequently in addition given a light dipping in varnish 
as a protection against the decaying influences of the atmos- 
phere. 
The only wise preservatives are those long known and 
employed by our ancestors; salt, vinegar, and spices are all 
food preservatives, but they are at the same time substances 
which in small amounts are not injurious to the body. Smoked 
herring and salted mackerel are chemically preserved foods, 
but they are none the less safe and digestible. 
235. The Preservation of Wood and Metal. The decaying 
of wood and the rusting of metal are due to the action of air 
and moisture. When wood and metal are surrounded with a 
covering which neither air nor moisture can penetrate, decay
-P-A-G-E-254
  254 CHEMICAL DISINFECTANTS AND PRESERVATIVES 
and rust are prevented. Paint affords such a protective 
covering. The main constituent of paint is a compo und of 
white lead or other metallic substance; this is mixed with 
linseed oil or its equivalent in order that it may be spread 
over wood and metal in a thin, even coating. After the 
mixture has been applied, it hardens and forms a tough skin 
fairly impervious to weathering. For the sake of ornamenta- 
tion, various colored pigments are added to the paint and 
give variety of effect. 
Railroad ties.and street paving blocks are ordinari ly pro- 
tected by oil rather than paint. Wood is soaked in creosote 
oil until it becomes thoroughly saturated with th e oily 
substance. The pores of the wood are thus closed to the 
entrance of air and moisture, and decay is avoided. Wood 
treated in this way is very durable. Creosote is poisonous to 
insects and many small animals, and thus acts as a preserva- 
tion not only against the elements but against animal 
well. Z life as

236. Stimulants and Narcotics. Man has learned not only 
the action of substances upon each other, such as bleaching 
solution upon coloring matter, washing soda upon grease, 
acids upon bases, but also the effect which certain chemicals 
have upon the human body. 
Drugs and their varying effects upon the human system 
have been known to mankind from remote ages; in the early 
days, familiar leaves, roots, and twigs were steeped in water 
to form medicines which served for the treatment of all ail- 
ments. In more recent times, however, these simple herb 
teas have been supplanted by complex drugs, and now medi- 
cines are compounded not only from innumerable plant 
products, but from animal and mineral matter as well. Qui- 
nine, rhubarb, and arnica are examples of purely vegetable 
products; iron, mercury, and arsenic are equally well known 
as distinctly mineral products, while cod-liver oil is the most 
familiar illustration of an animal remedy. Ordinarily a com- 
bination of products best serves the ends of the physician. 
Substances which; like cod-liver oil, serve as food to a 
worn-out body, or, like iron, tend to enrich the blood, or, like 
quinine, aid in bringing an abnormal system to a healthy con- 
dition, are valuable servants and cannot be entirely dispensed 
with so long as man is subject to disease. 
But substances which, like opium, laudanum, and alcohol, 
are not required by the body as food, or as a systematic, 
intelligent aid to recovery, but are taken solely for the stimu- 
lus aroused or for the insensibility induced, are harmful to 
255
-P-A-G-E-256
  256 DRUGS AND PATENT MEDICINES 
man, and cannot be indulged in by him without ultimate 
mental, moral, and physical loss. Substances of the latter 
class are known as narcotics and stimulants. | 
237. The Cost of Health. In the physical as in the finan- 
cial world, nothing is to be had without a price. Vigor, 
endurance, and mental alertness are bought by hygienic liv- 
ing; that is, by proper food, fresh air, exercise, cleanliness, 
and reasonable hours. Some people wish vigor, endurance, 
etc., but are unwilling to live the life which will develop these 
_ qualities. Plenty of sleep, exercise, and simple food all tend 
to lay the foundations of health. Many, however, are not 
willing to take the care necessary for healthful living, because 
it would force them to sacrifice some of the hours of pleasure. 
Sooner or later, these pleasure-seekers begin to feel tired and 
worn, and some of them turn to drugs and narcotics for arti- 
ficial strength. At first the drugs seem to restore the lost 
energy, and without harm; however, the cost soon proves to 
be one of the highest Nature ever demands. 
238. The Uncounted Cost. The first and most obvious 
effect of opium, for example, is to deaden pain and to arouse 
pleasure; but while the drug is producing these soothing 
sensations, it interferes with bodily functions. Secretion, di- 
gestion, absorption of food, and the removal of waste matters 
are hindered. Continued use of the drug leads to headache, 
exhaustion, nervous depression, and heart weakness. There 
is thus a heavy toll reckoned against the user, and the cred- 
itor is relentless in demanding payment. 
Moreover, the respite allowed by a narcotic is exceedingly 
brief, and a depression which is long and deep inevitably 
follows. In order to overcome this depression, recourse is 
usually had to a further dose, and as time goes on, the inter- 
vals of depression become more frequent and lasting, and 
the necessity to overcome them increases. Thus without in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  PATENT MEDICINES, COUGH S/RUPS 257 
tention one finds one’s self bound to the drug, its fast victim. 
The sanatoria of our country are crowded with people who 
are trying to free themselves of a drug habit into which they 
have drifted unintentionally if not altogether unknowingly. 
What is true of opium is equally applicable to other narcotics. 
239. The Right Use of Narcotics. In the hands of the 
physician, narcotics are a great blessing. In some cases, by 
relieving pain, they give the system the rest necessary for 
overcoming the cause of the pain. Only those who know of 
the suffering endured in former times can fully appreciate the 
decrease in pain brought about by the proper use of narcotics. 
240. Patent Medicines, Cough Sirups. A reputable physician 
is solicitous regarding the permanent welfare of his patient 
and administers carefully chosen and harmless drugs. Mere 
medicine venders, however, ignore the good of mankind, 
and flood the market with cheap patent preparations which 
delude and injure those who purchase, but bring millions of 
dollars to those who manufacture. 
Practically all of these patent, or proprietary, preparations 
contain a large proportion of narcotics or stimulants, and hence 
the benefit which they seem to afford the user is by no means 
genuine ; examination shows that the relief brought by them is 
due either to a temporary deadening of sensibilities by narcotics 
or toa fleeting stimulation by alcohol and kindred substances. 
Among the most common ailments of both young and old 
are coughs and colds; hence many patent cough mixtures 
have been manufactured and placed on the market for the 
consumption of a credulous public. Such “quick cures” 
almost invariably contain one or more narcotic drugs, and 
not only do not relieve the cold permanently, but occasion 
subsequent disorders. Even lozenges and pastilles are not 
free from fraud, but have a goodly proportion of narcotics, 
containing in some cases chloroform, morphine, and ether.

    258 DRUGS AND PATENT MEDICINES | I 
The widespread use of patent cough medicines is due 
largely to the fact that many persons avoid consulting a 
physician about so trivial an ailment as an ordinary cold, or 
are reluctant to pay a medical fee for what seems a slight 
indisposition and hence attempt to doctor themselves. 
Catarrh is a very prevalent disease in America, and conse- 
quently numerous catarrh remedies have been devised, most 
of which contain in a disguised form the pernicious drug, 
cocaine. Laws have been enacted which require on the 
labels a declaration of the contents of the preparation, both 
as to the kind of drug used and the amount, and the choice 
of accepting or refusing such mixtures is left to the indi- 
vidual. But the great mass of people are ignorant of the 
harmful nature of drugs in general, and hence do not even 
read the self-accusing label, or if they do glance at it, fail to 
comprehend the dangerous nature of the drugs specified there. 
In order to safeguard the uninformed purchaser and to re- 
strict the manufacture of harmful patent remedies, some states 
limit the sale of all preparations containing narcotics and thus 
give free rein to neither consumer nor producer. } 
241. Soothing Sirups; Soft Drinks: The development of 
a race is limited by the mental and physical growth of its 
_ children, and yet thousands of its children are annually stunted 
and weakened by drugs, because most colic cures, teething con- 
coctions, and soothing syrups are merely agreeably flavored 
drug mixtures. Those who have used such preparations 
freely, know that a child usually becomes fretful and irritable 
between doses, and can be quieted only by larger and more 
frequent supplies. A habit formed in this way is difficult to 
overcome, and many a child when. scarcely over its babyhood 
has a craving which in later years may lead to systematic 
drug taking. And even though the pernicious drug craving 
is not created, considerable harm is done to the child, because
-P-A-G-E-259
HEADACHE POWDERS 259 
its body is left weak and non-resistant to diseases of infancy 
and childhood. 
Many of our soft drinks contain narcotics. The use of the 
coca leaf and the kola nut for such preparations has increased 
very greatly within the last few years, and doubtless legisla- 
tion will soon be instituted against the indiscriminate sale of 
soft drinks. 
242. Headache Powders. The stress and strain of modern 
life has opened wide the door to a multitude of bodily ills, 
among which may be mentioned headache. Work must be 
done and business attended to, and the average sufferer does 
not take time from his vocation to investigate the cause of 
the headache, but unthinkingly grasps at any remedy which 
will remove the immediate pain, and utterly disregards later 
injury. The relief afforded by most headache mixtures is 
due to the presence of antipyrin or acetanilid, and it has 
been shown conclusively that these drugs weaken heart 
action, diminish circulation, reduce the number of red cor- 
puscles in the blood, and bring on a condition of chronic 
anemia. Pallid cheeks and blue lips are visible evidence of 
the too frequent use of headache powders. : 
The labels required by law are often deceptive and convey 
no adequate idea of the amount of drug consumed; for ex- 
ample, 240 grains of acetanilid to an ounce seems a small 
quantity of drug for a powder, but when one considers that 
there are only 480 grains in an ounce, it will be'seen that 
each powder is one half acetanilid. 
Powders taken in small quantities and at rare intervals 
are apparently harmless; but they never remove the cause 
of the trouble, and hence the discomfort soon returns with re- 
newed force. Ordinarily, hygienic living will eliminate the 
source of the trouble, but if it does not, a physician should 
be consulted and medicine should be procured from him

system are scarcely more than cheap cocktails, as one writer 
has derisively called them, and the amount of alcohol in some 
widely advertised patent remedies is alarmingly large and 
almost equal to that of strong whisky. 
Some conscientious persons who would not touch beer, 
wine, whisky, or any other intoxicating drink consume patent 
remedies containing large quantities of alcohol and thus 
unintentionally expose themselves to mental and physical 
danger. In all cases of bodily disorder, the only safe course 
is to consult a physician who has devoted himself to the study 
of the body and the methods by which a disordered system 
may be restored to health.

  CHAPTER XXVI c 
NITROGEN AND ITS RELATION TO PLANTS 
244. Nitrogen. A substance which plays an important 
part in animal and plant life is nitrogen. Soil and the ferti- 
lizers which enrich it, the plants which grow on it, and the 
animals which feed on these, all contain nitrogen or nitrog- 
enous compounds. The atmosphere, which we ordinarily 
think of as a storehouse of oxygen, contains far more nitrogen 
than oxygen, since four fifths of its whole weight is made up 
of this element. 
Nitrogen is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Air is com- 
posed chiefly of oxygen and nitrogen; if, therefore, the oxy- 
gen in a vessel filled with air can be made to unite with some 
other substance or can be removed, there will be a residue of 
nitrogen. This can be done by floating on water a light dish 
containing phosphorus, then igniting the phosphorus, and 
placing an inverted jar over the burning substance. The 
phosphorus in burning unites with the oxygen of the air and 
hence the gas that remains in the jar is chiefly nitrogen. It 
has the characteristics mentioned above and, in addition, does 
not combine readily with other substances. 
245. Plant Food. Food is the source of energy in every 
living thing and is essential to both animal and plant life. 
Plants get their food from the lifeless matter which exists 
in the air and in the soil; -while animals get their food 
from plants. It is true that man and many other animals eat 
261
-P-A-G-E-262
  262 MITROGEN AND ITS RELATION TO pliers 
fleshy foods and depend upon them for partial sistenanke, but 
the ultimate source of all animal food is plant life, since meat- 
producing animals live upon plant growth. | 
Plants get their food from the air, the soil, and moisture. 
From the air, the leaves take carbon dioxide and arated and 
transform them into starchy food; from the soil, the roots take 
water rich in mineral matters dissolved from the soil. From 
the substances thus gathered, the plant lives and builds up 
its structure. 
A food substance necessary to plant life and growth is ni- 
trogen. Since a vast store of nitrogen exists in the air, it 
would seem that plants should never lack for this food, but 
most plants are unable to make use of the boundless store of 
atmospheric nitrogen, because they do not possess the power 
of abstracting nitrogen from the air. For this reason, they 
have to depend solely upon nitrogenous compounds which 
are present in the soil and are soluble in water. The soluble 
nitrogenous soil compounds are absorbed by roots and are 
utilized by plants for food. 
246. The Poverty of the Soil. Plant roots are constantly 
taking nitrogen and its compounds from the soil. If crops 
which grow from the soil are removed year after year, the soil 
becomes poorer in nitrogen, and finally possesses too little of it 
to support vigorous and healthy plant life. The nitrogen of 
the soil can be restored if we add to it a fertilizer containing 
nitrogen compounds which are soluble in water. Decayed 
vegetable matter contains large quantities of nitrogen com- 
pounds, and hence if decayed vegetation is placed upon soil 
or is plowed into soil, it acts as a fertilizer, returning to the 
soil what was taken from it. Since man and all other animals 
subsist upon plants, their bodies likewise contain nitrogenous 
substances, and hence manure and waste animal matter is 
valuable as a fertilizer or soil restorer.
-P-A-G-E-263
  ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZERS 263 
‘247. Bacteria as Nitrogen Gatherers. Soil from which crops 
are removed year after year usually becomes less fertile, but 
the soil from which crops \ 
of clover, peas, beans, or f 
alfalfa have been removed 
is richer in nitrogen rather 
than poorer. This is because 
the roots of these plants 
often have on them tiny 
swellings, or tubercles, in 
which millions of certain 
bacteria live and multiply. 
These bacteria have the re- : 5 FIG. 162, — Roots of soy bean having tuber- 
markable power of taking cle-bearing bacteria. 
free nitrogen from the air in 
the soil and of combining it with other substances to form com- 
pounds which plants canuse. The bacteria-made compounds 
dissolve in the soil water and are absorbed into the plant by the 
roots. Somuch nitrogen-containing material is made by the 
root bacteria of plants of the pea family that the soil in which 
they grow becomes somewhat richer in nitrogen, andif plants 
which cannot make nitrogen are subsequently planted in such 
a soil, they find there a store of nitrogen. A crop of peas, 
beans, or clover is equivalent to nitrogenous fertilizer and 
helps to make ready the soil for other crops. 
248. Artificial Fertilizers. Plants need other foods besides 
nitrogen, and they exhaust the soil not only of nitrogen, but 
also of phosphorus and potash, since large quantities of these 
are necessary for plant life. There are many other sub- 
stances absorbed from the soil by the plant, namely, iron, 
sodium, calcium, magnesium, but these are used in smaller 
quantities and the supply in the soil does not readily become 
exhausted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
264 NITROGEN AND ITS RELATION TO ei 
Commercial fertilizers generally contain nitrogen, ee 
rus, and potash in amounts varying with the requirements of 
the soil. Wheat requires a large amount of phosphorus and 
quickly exhausts the ground of that food 
stuff; a field which has supported a crop 
of wheat is particularly poor in phosphorus, 
and a satisfactory fertilizer for that land 
would necessarily contain a large percent- 
age of phosphorus. The fertilizer to be 
used in a soil depends upon the character 
of the soil and upon the crops previously 
: grown on it. 
The quantity of fertilizer needed by the 
farmers of the world is eoennle and 
the problem of securing the necessary sub- 
stances in quantities sufficient to satisfy 
the demand bids fair to be serious. But

tures of buckwheat: modern chemistry is at work on the prob- 
1, with all the food Jem, and already it is possible to make elements; 2, without 
potash; 3, without some nitrogen compounds on a commercial 
i aes scale. When nitrogen gas is in contact 
with heated calcium carbide, a reaction takes place which 
results in the formation of calcium nitride, a compound suit- 
able for enriching the soil. There are other commercial 
methods for obtaining nitrogen compounds which are suit- 
able for absorption by plant roots. 
Phosphorus is obtained from bone ash and from phosphate 
rock which is widely distributed over the surface of the earth. 
Bone ash and thousands of tons of phosphate rock are treated 
with sulphuric acid to form a phosphorus compound which is 
soluble in soil water and which, when added to soil, will be 
usable by the plants growing there. | 
The other important ingredient of most fertilizers is potash.
-P-A-G-E-265
  ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZERS 205 
Wood ashes are rich in potash and are a valuable addition to 
the soil. But the amount of potash thus obtained is far too 
limited to supply the needs of agriculture; and to-day the 
main sources of potash are the vast deposits of potassium 
salts found in Prussia. { 
Although Germany now furnishes the American farmer 
with the bulk of his potash, she may not do so much longer. 
In 1911 an indirect potash tax was levied by Germany on her 
best customer, the United States, to whom 15 million dollars’ 
worth of potash had been sold the preceding year. This led 
Americans to inquire whether potash could not be obtained at 
home. 
Geologists say that long ages ago Germany was submerged, 
that the waters slowly evaporated and that the various sub- 
stances in the sea water'were deposited in thick layers. The 
deposits thus left by the evaporation of the sea water gradu- 
ally became hidden by sediment and soil, and lost to sight. 
From such deposits, potash is obtained. Geologists tell us 
that our own Western States were once submerged, and that 
the waters evaporated and disappeared from our land very 
much as they did from Germany. The Great Salt Lake of 
Utah is a relic of a great body of water. If it be true that 
waters once covered our Western States, there may be buried 
deposits of potash there, and to-day the search for the hidden 
“treasure is going on with the energy and enthusiasm charac- 
teristic of America. 
Another probable source of potash is seaweed. The sea 
is a vast reservoir of potash, and seaweed, especially the 
giant kelp, absorbs large quantities of this potash. A ton of 
dried kelp (dried by sun and wind) contains about 500 pounds 
of pure potash. The kelps are abundant, covering thousands 
of square miles in the Pacific Ocean, from Mexico to the 
Arctic Ocean.

  CHAPTER XXVII 
SOUND 
249. The Senses. All the information which we poate 
of the world around us comes to us through the use of the 
senses of sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. Of the five 
senses, sight and hearing are generally considered the most 
valuable. In preceding Chapters we studied the important 
facts relative to light and the power of vision ; it remains for 
us to study Sound as we studied Light, and to learn what we 
can of sound and the power to hear. 
250. How Sound is Produced. If 
¢ one investigates the source of any 
sound, he will always find that it is 
due to motion of some kind. A sud- 
den noise is traced to the fall of an 
object, or to an explosion, or to a col- 
lision; in fact, is due to the motion 
4 of matter. A piano gives out sound 
whenever a player strikes tye keys 
and sets in motion the various wires’ 
within the piano; speech and song 
are caused by the motion of chest, 
p vocal cords, and lips. 
eG rGes == Sprays of water If a large dinner bell is rung, its 
eta tet the fork is in motion or vibration may be felt on 
; touching it with the finger. If a tuning 
fork is made to give forth sound by striking it against the knee, 
or hitting it with a rubber hammer, and is then touched to the

-P-A-G-E-267
  SOUND IS CARRIED BY MATTER 267 
surface of water, small sprays of water will be thrown out, 
showing that the prongs of the fork are in rapid motion. (A. 
rubber hammer is made by putting a piece of glass tubing 
through a rubber cork.) 
If a light cork ball on the end of a thread is brought in 
contact with a sounding fork, the ball does not remain at rest, 
but vibrates back and forth, being 
driven by the moving prongs. 
These simple facts lead us to con- 
clude that all sound is due to the 
motion of matter, and that a sounding 
body of any kind is in rapid motion. 
251. Sound is carried by Matter. F!* 16, —The bal does nee 
In most cases sound reaches the 
ear through the air; but air is not the only medium through 
which sound is carried. A loud noise will startle fish, and 
cause them to dart away, so we conclude that the sound must 
have reached them through the water. An Indian puts his 
ear to the ground in order to detect distant footsteps, because © 
sounds too faint to be heard through the air are comparatively 
clear when transmitted through the earth. A gentle tapping 
at one end of a long table can be distinctly heard at the 
opposite end if the ear is pressed against the table; if the 
ear is removed from the wood, the sound of tapping is much 
fainter, showing that wood transmits sound more readily than 
air. We see therefore that sound can be transmitted to the 
ear by solids, liquids, or gases. 
Matter of any kind can transmit sound to the ear. The 
following experiments will show that matter is necessary for 
transmission. Attach a small toy bell to a glass rod (Fig. 
166) by means of a rubber tubeand pass the rod through one 
of two openings in a rubber cork. Insert thecork in a strong 
flask containing a small quantity of water and shake the bell, 
   
-P-A-G-E-268
  268 SOUND | 
noting the sound produced. Then heat the flask, allowing the 
water to boil briskly, and after the boiling has continued for a 
: few minutes remove the flame and instantly 
close up the second opening by inserting a 
glass stopper. Now shake the flask and 
note that the sound is very much fainter 
than at first. As the flask was warmed, air 
was rapidly expelled; so that when the 
flask was shaken the second time, less air 
was present to transmit the sound. If the 
glass stopper is removed and the air is 
allowed to reénter the flask, the loudness 
of the sound immediately increases. 
Since the sound of the bell grows fainter 
as air is removed, we infer that there would 
be no sound if all the air were removed

not be transmitted through empty space 
or avacuum. If sound is to reach our ears, it must be through 
the agency of matter, such as wood, water, or air, etc. 
252. How Sound is transmitted through Air. We saw in 
Section 250 that sound can always be traced to the motion 
or vibration of matter. It is impossible to conceive of an 
object being set into sudden and continued motion without 
disturbing the air immediately surrounding it. A sounding 
body always disturbs and throws into vibration the ai} around 
it, and the air particles which receive motion from a sounding 
body transmit their motion to neighboring particles, these in 
turn to the next adjacent particles, and so on until the motion 
has traveled to very great distances. The manner in which 
vibratory motion is transmitted by the atmosphere must be 
unusual in character, since no motion of the air is apparent, 
and since in the stillness of night when “ not a breath of air” is 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
HOW SOUND IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH AIR 269 
stirring, the shriek of a railroad whistle miles distant may be 
heard with perfect clearness. Moreover, the most delicate 
notes of a violin can be heard in the remotest corners of a 
concert hall, when not the slightest motion 
of the air can be seen or felt. 
In our study of the atmosphere we saw 
that air can be compressed and rarefied; in 
other words, we saw that air is very elastic. 
It can be shown experimentally that when- 
ever an elastic body in motion comes in con- _ : 
tact with a body at rest, the moving body *"™ "7.7, Maste 
transfers its motion to the second body 
and then comes to rest itself. Let two billiard balls be sus- 
pended in the manner indicated in Figure 167. If one of the 
balls is drawn aside and is then allowed to fall against the other, 
the second ball is driven outward to practically the height from 
which the first ball fell and the first ball comes to rest. 
If a number of. balls are arranged in line as in Figure 168 or 
Figure 169, and the end ball is raised and then allowed to fall, 
or if A is pushed against C, the last ball B will move outward 
alone, with a force nearly equal to that originally possessed 
by A and to a distance nearly equal to that through which 4 
moved. -But there will be no visb/e motion of the interven- 
ing balls. The force of the moving 
ball A is given to the second ball, 
and the second ball in turn gives 
the motion to the third, and so on 
throughout the entire number, until

the balls lying between these points. Similarly the particles

which interpret the motion as sound. 
253. Why Sound dies away with Distance. Since the last ball 
> & is driven outward with a force nearly equal to that possessed 
by A, it would seem that the effect on the ear drum should 
be independent of distance and that a sound should be heard 
‘as distinctly when remote as when near. But we know from

| 
experience that this is not true, because the more distant the 
source of sound, the fainter the impression; and finally, if
-P-A-G-E-271
  VELOCITY OF SOUND 271 
the distance between the source of sound and the hearer be- 
comes too great, the sound disappears entirely and nothing 
is heard. The explanation of this well-known fact is found 
ina further study of the elastic balls (Fig. 170). If A hits two 
balls instead of one, the energy possessed by J is given in 
part to one ball, and in part to the other, so that neither ob- 
tains the full amount. These balls, having each received less 
than the original energy, have less to transmit; each of these 
balls in turn meets with others, and hence the motion be- 
comes more and more distributed, and distant balls receive 
less and less impetus. The energy finally given becomes 
too slight to affect neighboring balls, and the system comes 
to rest. This is what cccurs in the atmosphere; a moving 
air particle meets not one but many adjacent air particles, 
and each of these receives a portion of the original energy and 
transmits a portion. When the original disturbance becomes 
scattered over a large number of air particles, the energy given 
to any one air particle becomes correspondingly small, and 
finally the energy becomes so small that further particles are 
not affected; beyond this limit the sound cannot be heard. 
If an air particle transmitted motion only to those air par- 
ticles directly in line with it, we should not be able to detect 
sound unless the ear were in direct line with the source. 
The fact that an air particle divides its motion among all 
particles which it touches, that is, among those on the sides 
as well as those in front, makes it possible to hear sound in all 
directions. A good speaker is heard not only by those 
directly in front of him, but by those on the side, and even 
behind him. 
/ 254. Velocity of Sound. The transmission of motion from 
f particle to particle does not occur instantaneously, but re- 
quires time. If the distance is short, so that few air particles 
are involved, the time required for transmission is very brief, 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
    272 SOUND 
and the sound is heard at practically the instant it is made. 
Ordinarily we are not conscious that it requires time for 
sound to travel from its source to our ears, because the dis- 
tance involved is too short. At other times we recognize 
that there is a delay; for example, thunder reaches our ears 
after the lightning which caused the thunder has completely 
disappeared. If the storm is near, the interval of time 
between the lightning and the thunder is brief, because the 
sound does not have far to travel; if the storm is distant, 
the interval is much longer, corresponding to the greater dis- 
tance through which the sound travels. Sound does not 
move instantaneously, but requires time for its transmission. 
The report of a distant cannon is heard after the flash and 
smoke are seen; the report of a near cannon is heard the in- 
stant the flash is seen. | 
The speed with which sounds travels through the air, or its 
velocity, was first measured by noting the interval (54.6 
seconds) which elapsed between the flash of a cannon and 
the sound of the report. The distance of the cannon from 
the observer was measured and found to be 61,045 feet, and 
by dividing this distance by the number of seconds, we find 
that the distance traveled by sound in one second is ap- 
proximately 1118 feet. | 
High notes and low notes, soft notes and shrill notes, all 
travel at the same rate. If bass notes traveled faster or 
slower than soprano notes, or if the delicate tones of the 
violin traveled faster or slower than the tones of a drum, 
music would be practically impossible, because at a distance 
from the source of sound the various tones which should 
be in unison would be out of time—some arriving late, 
some early. | 
255. Sound Waves. Practically every one knows that a 
hammock hung with long ropes swings or vibrates more slowly
-P-A-G-E-273
  SOUND WAVES 273 
than one hung with short ropes, and that a stone suspended 
by a long string swings more slowly than one suspended by a 
short string. No two 
rocking chairs vibrate 
in the same way unless 
they are exactly alike in 
shape, size, and material. 
An object when dis- 
turbed vibrates in a 
manner peculiar to itself, 
the vibration being slow, x 
as in the case of the 
long-roped_ swing, or i 
quick, as in the case of the short-roped swing. The time 
required for a single swing or vibration is called the period of 
the body, and everything that can vibrate has a characteristic 
period. Size and shape determine to a large degree the 
period of a body; for example, a short, thick tuning fork 
vibrates more rapidly than a tall slender fork. 
Some tuning forks when struck vibrate so 
rapidly that the prongs move back and forth 
more than 5000 times per second, while other 
tuning forks vibrate so slowly that the vibra- 
tions do not exceed 50 per second. In either 
case the distance through which the prongs 
move is very small and the period is very 
short, so that the eye can seldom detect the 
Fic. 172.—The movement itself. That the prongs are in mo- pitch given out 
by a fork de- tion, however, is seen by the action of a pith 
Pabe upon Shall when brought in contact with the prongs 
(see Section 250). 
The disturbance created by a vibrating body is called a 
wave.

256. Waves. 
  SOUND | 
While the disturbance which travels out 
from a sounding body is commonly called a wave, it is by no 
  means like the type of wave best known 
to us, namely, the water wave. 
If a closely coiled heavy wire is sus- 
pended as in Figure 173 and the weight is 
drawn down and then released, the coil 
will assume the appearance shown; there 
is clearly an overcrowding or conden- 
sation in some places, and a spreading 
out or rarefaction in other places. The 
pulse of condensation and rarefaction 
which travels the length of the wire is 
called a wave, although it bears little or 
no resemblance to the familiar water wave. 
Sound waves are similar to the waves 
formed in the stretched coil. | 
Sound waves may be said to consist of a 
series of condensations and rarefactions, 
and the distance between two consecutive 
condensations and rarefactions may be de- 
fined as the wave length. 
257. How One Sounding Body produces 
Sound in Another Body. In Section 255 
we saw that any object when disturbed 
Fic, 173. — Waves in a vibrates in a manner peculiar to itself, — coiled wire, 
its natural period,—a long-roped ham- 
mock vibrating slowly and a short-roped hammock vibrating 
rapidly. From observation we learn that it requires but little 
force to cause a body to vibrate in its natural period. If a 
sounding body is near a body which has the same period as 
itself, the pulses of air produced by the sounding body will, 
although very small, set the second body into motion and cause
-P-A-G-E-275
  
  SOUNDING BODIES 275 
itto makea faint sound. When a pianois being played, we are 
often startled to find that a window pane or an ornament re- 
sponds to some note of the piano. If two tuning forks of ex- 
actly identical periods (that is, of the same frequency) are 
placed ona table as in 
Figure 174, and one is 
struck so as to give forth 
a clear sound, the second 
fork will likewise vibrate, 
even though the two 
forks may be separated 
by several feet of air. 
We can readily see that 
the second fork is in 
motion, although it has 
not been struck, because 
it will set in motion a pith ball suspended beside it; at first 
the pith ball does not move, then it moves slightly, and 
finally bounces rapidly back and forth. If the periods 
of the two forks are not identical, but differ in the slight- 
est degree, the second fork will not respond to the first 
fork, no matter how long or how loud the sound of the first 
fork. If we suppose that the fork vibrates 256 times each 
second, then 256 gentle pulses of air are produced each 
second, and these, traveling outward through the air, reach 
the silent fork, and tend to set it in motion. A single pulse 
of air could not move the solid, heavy prongs, but the accu- 
mulated action of 256 vibrations per second soon makes itself 
felt, and the second fork begins to vibrate, at first gently, 
then gradually stronger, and finally an audible tone is given 
forth. 
The cumulative power of feeble forces acting frequently at 
definite intervals is seen in many ways in everyday life. A     
FIG. 174. — When the first fork vibrates, the sec- 
ond responds.

small boy can easily sying a much larger boy, provided he 
gives the swing a gentle push in the right direction every 
time it passes him. But he must be careful to push at the 
proper instant, since otherwise his effort does not count for 
much; if he pushes forward when the swing is moving back- 
ward, he really hinders the motion; if he waits until the swing 
has moved considerably forward, his push counts for little. 
He must push at the proper instant ; that is, the way in which 
his hand moves in giving the push must correspond exactly 
with the way in which the swing would naturally vibrate. A 
very striking experiment can be made by suspending from 
the ceiling a heavy weight and striking this weight gently at 
regular, properly timed intervals with a small cork hammer. 
Soon the pendulum, or weight, will be set swinging. _ 
258. Borrowed Sound. Picture frames and ornaments 
sometimes buzz and give forth faint murmurs when a piano 
or organ is played. The waves sent out by a 
sounding body fall upon all surrounding ob- 
jects and by their repeated action tend to 
throw these bodies into vibration. If the 
period of any one of the objects corresponds 
with the period of the sounding body, the 
gentle but frequent impulses affect the object, 
Fic. 175,—The Which responds by emitting a sound. If, how- 
hollow wooden ever, the periods do not correspond, the action box reénforces : : the! sound, of the sound waves is not sufficiently powerful 
: to throw the object into vibration, | and no 
sound is heard. Bodies which respond in this way are said 
to be sympathetic and the response produced is called ves- 
onance. Seashells when held to the ear seem to contain the 
roar of the sea; this is because the air within the shell is set 
into sympathetic vibrations by some external tone. If the 
seashell were held to the ear in an absolutely quiet room, no 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
ECHO 277 
sound would be heard, because there would be no external 
forces to set into vibration the air within the shell. 
Tuning forks do not produce strong tones unless mounted 
on hollow wooden boxes (Fig. 175), whose size and shape 
are so adjusted that resonance occurs and strengthens the 
sound. When a human being talks or sings, the air within 
the mouth cavity is thrown into sympathetic vibration and 
strengthens the otherwise feeble tone of the speaker. 
259. Echo. If one shouts in a forest, the sound is some- 
times heard a second time a second or two later. This is be- 
cause sound is reflected when it strikes a large obstructing 
surface. If the sound waves resulting from the shout meet a 
cliff or a mountain, they are reflected back, and on reaching 
the ear produce a later sensation of sound. 
By observation it has been found that the ear cannot dis- 
tinguish sounds which are less than one tenth of a second 
apart; that is, if two sounds follow each other at an interval 
less than one tenth of a second, the ear recognizes not two 
sounds, but one. This explains why a speaker can be heard 
better indoors than in the open air. In the average building, 
the walls are so close that the reflected waves have but a short 
distance to travel, and hence reach the ear at practically the 
same time as those which: come directly from the speaker. 
In the open, there are no reflecting walls or surfaces, and the 
original sound has no reénforcement from reflection. 
If the reflected waves reach the ear too late to blend with the 
original sound, that is, come later than one tenth of a second 
after the first impression, an echo is heard. What we call 
the rolling of thunder is really the reflection and re-reflection 
of the original thunder from cloud and cliff. 
Some halls are so large that the reflected sounds cause a 
confusion of echoes, but this difficulty can be lessened by 
hanging draperies, which break the reflection. :

278 SOUND | 
260. Motion does not always produce Sound. While we 
know that all sound can be traced to motion, we know equally 
well that motion does not always produce sound. The ham- 
mock swinging in the breeze does not give forth a sound; 
the flag floating in the air does not give forth a sound unless 
blown violently by the wind; a card moved slowly through 
the air does not produce sound, but if the card is moved 
rapidly back and forth, a sound becomes audible. 
Motion, in order to produce sound, must be rapid; a ball 
“attached to a string and moved slowly through the air produces 
no sound, but the same ball, whirled rapidly, produces a dis- 
tinct buzz, which becomes stronger and stronger the faster 
the ball is whirled. 
261. Noise and Music. When the rapid motions which 
produce sound are irregular, we hear noise; when the motions 
are regular and definite, we have a musical tone; the rattling ~ 
of carriage wheels on stones, the roar of waves, the rustling 
of leaves are noise, not music. In all these illustrations we 
have rapid but irregular motion; no two stones strike the 
wheel in.exactly the same way, no two waves produce pulses 
in the air of exactly the same character, no two leaves rustle 
in precisely the same way. The disturbances which reach 
the ear from carriage, waves, and leaves are irregular both in” 
time and strength, and irritate the ear, causing the sensa- 
tion which we call noise. 
The tuning fork is musical. Here we have rapid, regular 
motion; vibrations follow each other at perfectly definite 
intervals, and the air disturbance produced by one vibration is 
exactly like the disturbance produced by a later vibration. 
The sound waves which reach the ear are regular in time and 
kind and strength, and we call the sensation music. 
To produce noise a body must vibrate in such a way as to 
give short, quick shocks to the air; to produce music a body  
-P-A-G-E-279
Pe te Se hee ee ee 
/ 
NOISE AND MUSIC 279 
must not only impart short, quick shocks to the air, but 
must impart these shocks with unerring regularity and 
strength. A flickering light irritates the eye; a flickering 
sound or noise irritates the ear; both are painful because of 
the sudden and abrupt changes in effect which they cause, 
the former on the eye, the latter on the ear. 
The only thing essential for the production of a musical 
sound is that the waves which reach the ear shall be rapid 
and regular; it is immaterial how these 
waves are produced. If a toothed wheel 
is mounted and slowly rotated, and a stiff 
card is held against the teeth of the wheel, 
a distinct tap is heard every time the card 
strikes the wheel. But if the wheel is ro- 
tated rapidly, the ear ceases to hear the 
various taps and recognizes a deep contin- 
uous musical tone. The blending of the ; 
ie ge . ° Fic, 176.—A rotating 
individual taps, occurring at regular inter- disk. 
vals, has produced a sustained musical 
tone. A similar result is obtained if.a card is drawn slowly 
and then rapidly over the teeth of a comb. 
That musical tones are due to a succession of regularly 
timed impulses is shown most clearly by means of a rotating 
disk on which are cut two sets of holes, the outer set equally 
spaced, and the inner set unequally spaced (Fig. 176). 
If, while the disk is rotating rapidly, a tube is held over 
the outside row and air is blown through the tube, a sus- 
tained musical tone will be heard. If, however, the tube is 
held, during the rotation of the disk, over the inner row of 
unequally spaced holes, the musical tone disappears, and a 
series of noises take its place. In the first case, the separate 
puffs of air followed each other regularly and blended into 
one tone; in the second case, the separate puffs of air followed 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
280 SOUND 
each other at uncertain and irregular intervals and the result 
was noise. 
Sound possesses a musical quality only when the waves or 
pulses follow each other at absolutely regular intervals. 
262. The Effect of the Rapidity of Motion on the Musical 
Tone Produced. If the disk is rotated so slowly that less 
than about 16 puffs are produced in one second, only sepa- 
rate puffs are heard, and a musical tone is lacking; if, on 
the other hand, the disk is rotated in such a way that 16 puffs 
or more are produced in one second, the separate puffs will 
blend together to produce a continuous musical note of very 
low pitch. If the speed of the disk is increased so that the 
puffs become more frequent, the pitch of the resulting note 
rises; and at very high speeds the notes produced become 
so shrill and piercing as to be disagreeable to the ear. If the 
Hf - speed of the disk is lessened, the pitch falls correspondingly ; 
and if the speed again becomes so low that less than 16 puffs 
are formed per second, the sustained sound disappears and 
a series of intermittent noises is produced. 
263. The Pitch of a Note. By means of’ an apparatus 
called the siren, it is possible to calculate the number of vibra- 
tions producing any given musical note, such, for example, as 
middle C on the piano. If air is forced continuously against 
the disk as it rotates, a series of puffs will be heard (Fig. 177). 
If the disk turns fast enough, the puffs blend into a musical 
sound, whose pitch rises higher and higher as the disk moves 
faster and faster, and produces more and more puffs each 
second. 
The instrument is so constructed that clockwork at the 
top registers the number of revolutions made by the disk in 
one second. The number of holes in the disk multiplied by 
the number of revolutions a second gives the number of 
puffs of air produced in one second. If we wish to find the  
-P-A-G-E-281
THE PITCH OF A NOTE 281 
number of vibrations which correspond to middle C on the 
piano, we increase the speed of the disk until the note given 
forth by the siren agrees with middle C as sounded on the 
piano, as nearly as the ear can judge; we then calculate the 
number of puffs of air which took place each second at that 
particular speed of the disk. In this way we find that middle 
C is due to about 256 vibrations per second; that is, a piano 
  Fic, 177.—A siren, 
string must vibrate 256 times per second in order for the re- 
sultant note to be of pitch middle C. Ina similar manner we 
determine the following frequencies : — 
do re mi fa sol la si do 
Cc D E F G A B Cc 
256 288 320 341 384 427 480 512 
The pitch of pianos, from the lowest bass note to the very 
highest treble, varies from 27 to about 3500 vibrations per 
second. No human voice, however, has so great a range of 
tone; the highest soprano notes of women correspond to 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
282 SOUND 
but 1000 vibrations a second, and the deepest bass of men 
falls but to 80 vibrations a second. 
While the human voice is limited in its production of sound, 
—rarely falling below 80 vibrations a second and rarely ex- 
ceeding 1000 vibrations a second, — the ear is by no means lim- 
ited to that range in hearing. The chirrup of a sparrow, the 
shrill sound of a cricket, and the piercing shrieks of a locomo- 
tive are due to far greater frequencies, the number of vibra- 
tions at times equaling 38,000 per second or more. 
( 264. The Musical Scale. When we talk, the pitch of the 
voice changes constantly and adds variety and beauty to con- 
versation ; a speaker whose tone, or pitch, remains too con- 
stant is monotonous and dull, no matter how brilliant his 
thoughts may be. 
While the pitch of the voice changes constantly, the changes 
are normally gradual and slight, and the different tones 
merge into each other imperceptibly. In music, however, 
there is a well-defined interval between even consecutive 
notes; for example, in the musical scale, middle C (do) with 
256 vibrations is followed by D (re) with 288 vibrations, and 
the interval between these notes is sharp and well marked, 
even to an untrained ear. The interval between two notes is 
defined as the ratio of the frequencies; hence, the interval be- 
tween C and D (do and re) is 238, or 3. Referring to Sec- 
tion 263, we see that the interval between C and E is 329, or 
§, and the interval between C and C’ is $42, or 2; the in- 
terval between any note and its octave is 2. 
The successive notes in one octave of the musical scale are 
related as follows : — 
Key of C C D E F G A B C

THE MUSICAL SCALE 283 
The intervals of F and A are not strictly 4 and $, but are 
nearly so; if F made 341.3 vibrations per second instead of 
341; and if A made 426.6 iristead of 427, then the intervals 
would be exactly $and 8. Since the real difference is so slight, 
we can assume the simpler ratios without appreciable error. 
Any eight notes whose frequencies are in the ratio of 2; 3, 
etc., will when played in succession give the familiar musical 
scale; for example, the deepest bass voice starts a musical 
scale whose notes have the frequencies 80, 90, 100, 107, 120, 
133, 150, 160, but the intervals here are identical with those 
of a higher scale; the interval between C and D, 80 and go, 
is 3, just as it was before when the frequencies were much 
greater; that is, 256 and 288. In singing “Home, Sweet

  CHAPTER XXVIII 
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
265. Musicalinstruments may be divided into three groups 
according to the different ways in which their tones are 
produced : — 
First. The stringed instruments in which ‘sound is pro- 
duced by the vibration of stretched strings, as in the piano, 
violin, guitar, mandolin. 
Second. The wind instruments in which sound is produced 
by the vibrations of definite columns of air, as in the organ, 
flute, cornet, trombone. 
Third. The percussion instruments, in which sound is 
produced by the motion of stretched membranes, as in the 
drum, or by the motion of metal disks, as in the tambourines 
and cymbals. 
266. Stringed Instruments. If the lid of a piano is opened, 
numerous wires are seen within; some long, some short, some 
coarse, some fine. Beneath each wire isa small felt ham- 
mer connected with the keys in such a way that when a key 
is pressed, a string is struck by a hammer and is thrown into 
vibration, thereby producing a tone. 
If we press the lowest key, that is, the key giving forth the 
lowest pitch, we see that the longest wire is struck and set 
into vibration ; if we press the highest key, that is, the key 
giving the highest pitch, we see that the shortest wire is 
struck. In addition, it is seen that the short wires which 
284
-P-A-G-E-285
  
STRINGED INSTRUMENTS 285 
produce the high tones are fine, while the long wires which 
produce the low tones are coarse. The shorter and finer the 
wire, the higher the pitch of the tone produced. The longer 
and coarser the wire, the lower the pitch of the tone produced. 
The constant striking of the hammers against the strings 
stretches and loosens them and alters their pitch; for this 
  FIG. 179. — Piano wires seen from the back. 
reason each string is fastened to a screw which can be turned 
so as to tighten the string or to loosen it if necessary. The 
tuning of the piano is the adjustment of the strings so that 
each shall produce a tone of the right pitch. When the strings 
are tightened, the pitch rises; when the strings are loosened, 
the pitch falls. 
What has been said of the piano applies as well to the 
violin, guitar, and mandolin. In the latter instruments the 
strings are tew in number, generally four, as against eighty- 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  286 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
eight in the piano; the hammer of the piano is replaced in 
the violin by the bow, and in the guitar by the fingers; vary- 
ing pitches on any one string are obtained by sliding a finger 
of the left hand along the wire, and thus altering its length. 
Frequent tuning is necessary, because the fine adjustments 
are easily disturbed. The piano is the best protected of all

267. Strings and their Tones. Fasten a violin string to a 
wooden frame or box, as shown in Figure 181, stretching it 
by means of some convenient weight; then lay a yard- 
stick along the box in order that the lengths may be deter- 
mined accurately. If the stretched string is plucked with 
the fingers or bowed with the violin bow, a clear musical 
sound of definite pitch will be produced. Now divide the
-P-A-G-E-287
STRINGS AND THEIR TONES 287 
string. into two equal parts by inserting the bridge midway 
between the two ends; and pluck either half as before. The 
note given forth is of a de- 
cidedly higher pitch, and if 
by means of the siren we fm ce

the frequency has been doubled by halving the length. If 
now the bridge is placed so that the string is divided into 
two unequal portions such as 1:3 and 2:3, and the shorter 
portion is plucked, the pitch will be still higher ; the shorter 
the length plucked, the higher the pitch produced. This mov- 
able bridge corresponds to the finger of the violinist; the finger 
slides back and forth along the string, thus changing the 
length of the bowed portion and producing variations in pitch.

allow of the simultaneous production of several tones.

268. The Freedom of a String. Some stringed instruments 
give forth tones which are clear and sweet, but withal thin 
and Jacking in richness and fullness. The tones sounded by 
two different strings may agree in pitch and loudness and yct 
produce quite different effects on the ear, because in one 
case the tone may be much more pleasing than in the other. 
The explanation of this is, that a string may vibrate in a 
number of different ways. 
Touch the middle of a wire with the finger or a pencil (Fig. 
182), thus separating it into two portions and draw a violin

bow across the center of either half. Only one half of the 
entire string is struck, but the motion of this half is imparted 
to the other half and throws it into similar motion, and if a 
tiny A-shaped piece of paper or rider is placed upon the un- 
bowed half, it is hurled off. 
If the wire is touched at a distance of one third its length 
and a bow is drawn across the middle of the smaller portion, 
the string will vibrate in three parts; we cannot always see 
these various motions in different parts of the string, but we 
know of their existence through the action of the riders.
-P-A-G-E-289
THE FREEDOM OF A STRING 289 
Similarly, touching the wire one fourth of its length from 
an end makes it vibrate in four segments; touching it one 
fifth of its length makes it vibrate in five segments. 
In the first case, the. string vibrated as a whole string and 
also as two strings of half the length; hence, three tones 
must have been given out, one tone due to the entire string 
and two tones due to the segments. But we saw in Section 
267 that halving the length of a string doubles the pitch of 
the resulting tone, and produces the octave of the original 
tone; hence a string vibrating as in Figure 183 gives forth 
        
      
      
  
  
    
    
  
        
      
  
  
          
        
                
                  
        
      
      
  
        
        
        
  
    
                        
    
      
                
        
  
          
        
      
FIG. 184. — When a string vibrates as a whole, it gives out the fundamental note, 
three tones, one of which is the fundamental tone of the 
string, and two of which are the octave of the fundamental 
tone. Hence, the vibrating string produces two sensations, 
that of the fundamental note and of its octave. 
When a string is plucked in the middle without being held, 
it vibrates simply as a whole (Fig. 184), and gives forth but one 
note; this is called the fundamental. If the string is made to 
vibrate in two parts, it gives forth two notes, the fundamental, 
and a note one octave higher than the fundamental; this is 
called the’ first overtone. When the string is made to move 
as in Figure 183, three distinct motions are called forth, the

-P-A-G-E-290
290 x MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
motion of the entire string, the motion of the portion plucked, 
and the motion of the remaining unplucked portion of the 
string. Here, naturally, different tones arise, corresponding 
to the different modes of vibration. . The note produced by 
the vibration of one third of the original string is called the 
second overtone. 
The above experiments show that a string is able to vibrate 
in a number of different ways at the same time, and to emit 
simultaneously a num- 
ae ber of different tones;

If, on the other hand, it vibrates in such a way that

and the sensation is pleasing. A tuning fork cannot vi- 
brate in more than one way, and hence has no overtones, 
and its tone, while clear and sweet, ‘is far less pleasing than 
the same note produced by a violin or piano. The un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  
THE INDIVIDUALITY OF INSTRUMENTS 291 
trained ear is not conscious of overtones and recognizes 
only the strong dominant fundamental. The overtones blend 
in with the fundamental and are so inconspicuously present 
that we do not realize their existence; it is only when they 
are absent that we become aware of the beauty which they 
add to the music. A song played on tuning forks instead 
of on strings would be lifeless and unsatisfying because of 
the absence of overtones. 
It is not necessary to hold finger or pencil at the points 
1:3, 1:4, etc., in order to cause the string to vibrate in va- 
rious ways; if a string is merely plucked or bowed at those 
places, the result will be the same. It is important to re- 
member that no matter where a string of definite length is 
bowed, the note most distinctly heard will be the funda- 
mental; but the quality of the emitted tone will vary with 
the bowing. For example, if a string is bowed in the mid- 
dle, the effect will be far less pleasing than though it were 
bowed near the end. In the piano, the hammers are ar- 
ranged so as to strike near one end of the string, at a dis- 
tance of about 1:7 to 1:9; and hence a large number of 
overtones combine to reénforce and enrich the fundamental 
tone. 
‘270. The Individuality of Instruments. It has been shown 
that a piano string when struck by a hammer, or a violin 
string when bowed, or a mandolin string when plucked, 
vibrates not only as a whole, but also in segments, and as a 
result gives forth not a simple tone, as we are accustomed to 
think, but a very complex tone consisting of the fundamental 
and one or more overtones. If the string whose fundamental 
note is lower C (128 vibrations per second) is thrown into 
vibration, the tone produced may contain, in addition to the 
prominent fundamental, any one or more of the following 
overtones: ..C', G!,‘C", El’, C’".ete.
-P-A-G-E-292
292 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
The number of overtones actually present depends upon a 
variety of circumstances: in the piano, it depends largely upon 
the location of the hammer; in the violin, upon the place and 
manner of bowing. Mechanical differences in construction 
account for prominent and numerous overtones in some in- 
struments and for feeble and few overtones in others. The 
oboe, for example, is so constructed that only the high over- 
tones are present, and hence the sound gives a “ pungent” 
effect; the clarinet is so constructed that the even-numbered 
overtones are killed, and the presence of only odd-numbered 
overtones gives individuality to the instrument. In these two 
instruments we have vibrating air columns instead of vibrat- 
ing strings, but the laws which govern vibrating strings are 
applicable to vibrating columns of air, as we shall see later. 
It is really the presence or absence of overtones which en- 
ables us to distinguish the note of the piano from that of the 
violin, flute, or clarinet. If overtones could be eliminated, 
then middle C, or any other note on the piano, would be in- 
distinguishable from that same note sounded on any other in- 
strument. The fundamental note in every instrument is the 
same, but the overtones vary with the instrument and lend in- 
dividuality to each. The presence of high overtones in the 
oboe and the presence of odd-numbered overtones in the 
clarinet enable us to distinguish without fail the sounds given 
out by these instruments. 
The richness and individuality of an instrument are due, 
not only to the overtones which accompany the fundamental, 
but also to the “forced” vibrations of the inclosing case, or of 
the sounding board. If a vibrating tuning fork is held in the 
hand, the sound will be inaudible except to those quite near; 
if, however, the base of the fork is held against the table, 
the sound is greatly intensified and becomes plainly audible 
throughout the room.
-P-A-G-E-293
THE KINDS OF STRINGED [NSTRUMENTS ‘293 
The vibrations of the fork are transmitted to the table top 
and throw it into vibrations similar to its own, and these addi- 
tional vibrations intensify the original sound. Any fork, no 
matter what its frequency, can force the surface of the table 
into vibration, and hence the sound of any fork will be intensified 
by contact with a table or box. 
This is equally true of strings; if stretched between two 
posts and bowed, the sound given out by a string is feeble, 
but if stretched over a sounding board, as in the piano, or 
over a wooden shell, as in the violin, the sound is intensified. 
Any note of the instrument will force the sounding body to 
vibrate, thus reénforcing the volume of sound, but some tones, 
or modes of vibration, do this more easily than others, and 
while the sounding board or shell always responds, it re- 
sponds in varying degree. Here again we have not only en- 
richment of sound but also individuality of instruments. 
271. The Kinds of Stringed Instruments. Stringed instru- 
ments may be grouped in the following three classes : — 
a. Instruments in which .the strings are set into motion by 
hammers — piano. 
6. Instruments in which the strings are set into motion 
by bowing — violin, viola, violoncello, double bass. 
c. Instruments in which the strings are set into motion by 
plucking — harp, guitar, mandolin. 
a. The piano is too well known to need comment. » In 
passing, it may be mentioned that in the construc- 
tion of the modern concert piano approximately 
40,000 separate pieces of material are used.. The 
large number of pieces is due, partly, to the fact 
that the single string corresponding to any one key 
is usually replaced by no less than three or four 
similar strings in order that greater volume of 
sound may be obtained. The hammer connected

-P-A-G-E-295
WIND INSTRUMENTS 295 
toa key strikes four or more strings instead of one, and hence produces a greater volume of tone. 
6. The viola is larger than the violin, has heavier and 
thicker strings, and is pitched to a lower key; in 
all other respects the two are similar. The vio- 
loncello, because of the length and thickness of its 
strings, is pitched a whole octave lower than the 
violin; otherwise it is similar. The unusual 
length and thickness of the strings of the double 
bass make it produce very low notes, so that it is ordinarily looked upon 
as the “bass voice” of 
the orchestra. 
c. The harp -has always been 
considered one of the 
most pleasing and per- 
fect of musical instru- 
ments. Here the skilled 
performer has absolutely 
free scope for his genius, 
because his fingers can 
pluck the strings at will 
and hence regulate the 
overtones, and his feet 
can regulate at will the 
tension, and hence the 
pitch of the strings. 
Guitar and mandolin are 
agreeable instruments 
for amateurs, but are 
never used in orchestral music. 
272. Wind Instruments. In the so-called wind instruments, sound is produced by vibrating columns of air inclosed in 
  Fic, 187.— A harp, 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
      2096 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
tubes or pipes of different lengths. The air column is thrown 
into vibration either directly, by blowing across a narrow open- 
ing at one end of a pipe as in the case of the whistle, or indi- 
rectly, by exciting vibrations in a thin strip of wood or metal, 
called a reed, which in turn communicates its vibrations to 
the air column within. 
The shorter the air column, the higher the pitch. This 
agrees with the law of vibrating strings which gives high 
pitches for short lengths. 
The pitch of the sound emitted by a 
column of air vibrating within a pipe varies 
according to the following laws : 
1. The shorter the pipe, the higher the 
pitch. 
2. The pitch of a note emitted by an 
open pipe is one octave higher than that 
of a closed pipe of equal length. 
3. Air columns vibrate in segments just 
as do strings, and the tone emitted by a 
pipe of given length is complex, consisting 
of the fundamental and one or more over- 
tones. The greater the number of over- 
| tones present, the richer the tone produced. 
Fic. 188.—Openorgan 273. How the Various Pitches are Pro- 
Pipes of different pitch. Guced. With a pipe of fixed length, for 
example, the clarinet (Fig. 189, 1), different pitches are ob- 
tained by pressing keys which open holes in the tube and 
thus shorten or lengthen the vibrating air column and 
produce a rise or fall in pitch. Changes in pitch are also 
produced by variation in the player’s breathing. By blowing 
hard or gently, the number of vibrations of the reed is in- 
creased or decreased and hence the pitch is altered. 
In the oboe (Fig. 189, 2) the vibrating air column is set into

  HOW THE VARIOUS PITCHES ARE PRODUCED 207 
motion by means of two thin pieces of wood or metal placed in 
the mouthpiece of the tube. Variations in pitch are produced as 
in the clarinet by means of stops and varied breathing. In the 
flute, the air is set into 
motion by direct blow- 
ing from the mouth, 
as ‘is done, for in- 
stance, when we blow 
into a bottle or key. 
The sound given 
out by organ pipes 
is due to air blown 
across a sharp edge at the opening of a narrow tube. The 
air forced across the sharp edge is thrown into vibration and 
communicates its vibration to the air within the organ pipe. 
For different 
pitches, pipes of 
different lengths 
are used : for very 
low pitches long, 
closed pipes are 
used; for very 
high pitches 
short, open pipes 
are used, “ihe 
mechanism of the 
organ is such that 
pressing a key 
allows the air to 
rush into the communicating pipe anda sound is produced 
characteristic of the length of the pipe. 
In the brass wind instruments such as horn, trombone, and 
trumpet, the lips of the player vibrate and excite the air

ing wind pressure of the musician; if he breathes fast, the EVV

which, on being pressed, vary the length of the tube and 
alter the pitch accordingly. In the trombone, valves are re- 
placed by a section which slides in and out and shortens or 
lengthens the tube. 
274. The Percussion Instruments. The percussion instru- 
ments, including kettledrums, bass drums, and cymbals, are 
the least important of all the musical instruments; and are 
usually of service merely in adding to the excitement and gen- 
eral effect of an orchestra. 
In orchestral music the various instruments are grouped 
somewhat as shown in Figure 192.

SPEAKING AND HEARING 
275. Speech. The human voice is the most perfect of musi- 
cal instruments. Within the throat, two elastic bands are at- 
tached to the windpipe at the place commonly called Adam’s 
apple; these flexible bands have received the name of vocal 
cords, since by their vibration all speech is produced. In 
ordinary breathing, the cords are loose and are separated by 
a wide opening through which air 
enters and leaves the lungs. When 
we wish to speak, muscular effort 
stretches the cords, draws them closer 
together, and reduces the opening 
between them to a narrow slit, as in 
the case of the organ pipe. If air 
FIG. 193.— The vibration of the from the lungs is sent through the 
vocal cords produces the sound ‘ GhiGe Ruan volbe: narrow slit, the vocal cords or bands 
are thrown into rapid vibration and 
produce sound. The pitch of the sound depends upon the 
tension of the stretched membranes, and since this can be 
altered by muscular action, the voice can be modulated at 
will. In times of excitement, when the muscles of the body 
in general are in a state of great tension, the pitch is likely to 
be uncommonly high. 
Women’s voices are higher than men’s because the vocal 
cords are shorter and finer; even though muscular tension is 
relaxed and the cords are made looser, the pitch of a woman’s 
voice does not fall so low as that of a man’s voice since his

-P-A-G-E-301
  THE EAR 301 
cords are naturally much longer and coarser. The difference 
between a soprano and an alto voice is merely one of length 
and tension of the vocal cords. 
Successful singing is possible only when the vocal cords 
are readily flexible and when the singer can supply a steady, 
continuous blast of air through the slit between the cords. 
The hoarseness which frequently accompanies cold in the 
head is due to the thickening of the mucous membrane and 
to the filling up of the slit with mucus, because when this 
happens, the vocal cords cannot vibrate properly. 
The sounds produced by the vocal cords are transformed 
into speech by the help of the tongue and lips, which modify 
the shape of the mouth cavity. Some of the lower animals 
have a speaking apparatus similar to our own, but they cannot 
perfectly transform sound into speech. The birds use their 
vocal cords to beautiful advantage in singing, far surpassing 
us in many ways, but the power of speech is lacking. 
276. The Ear. The pulses created in the air by a sound- 
ing body are received by the ear and the impulses which 
they impart to the auditory nerve pass to the brain and we 
become conscious of a sound. The ear is capable of marvel- 
ous discrimination and accuracy. ‘In order to form an idea of 
the extent of this power imagine an auditor in a large music 
hall where a full band and chorus are performing. Here, 
there are sounds mingled together of all varieties of pitch, 
loudness, and quality; stringed instruments, wood instru- 
ments, brass instruments, and voices, of many different kinds. 
And in addition to these there may be all sorts of accidental and 
irregular sounds and noises, such as the trampling and shuf- 
fling of feet, the hum of voices, the rustle of dress, the creak- 
ing of doors, and many others. Now it must be remembered 
that the only means the ear has of becoming aware of these 
simultaneous sounds is by the condensations and rarefac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
302, _ SPEAKING AND HEARING 
tions which reach it; and yet when the sound wave meets 
the nerves, the nerves single out each individual element, 
and convey to the mind of the hearer, not only the tones and 
notes of every instrument in the orchestra, but the character 
of every accidental noise; and almost as distinctly as if each 
single tone or noise were heard alone.” — PoLe. 
277. The Structure of the Ear. The external portion of 
the ear acts as a funnel for catching sound waves and leading + 
them into the canal, where they strike upon the ear drum, 
  
    DRUM MEMBRANE. 
QU7TER EAR. 
Fic, 194. The ear. 
or tympanic membrane, and throw it into vibration. Unless 
the ear drum is very flexible there cannot be perfect response 
to the sound waves which fall upon it; for this reason, the 
glands of the canal secrete a wax which moistens the mem- 
brane and keeps it flexible. Lying directly back of the 
tympanic membrane is a cavity filled with air which enters 
by the Eustachian tube; from the throat air enters the Eusta- 
chian tube, moves along it, and passes into the ear cavity. 
The dull crackling noise noticed in the ear when one swallows
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE PHONOGRAPH 303 
is due to the entrance and exit of air in the tube. Several 
small bones stretch across the upper portion of the cavity © 
and make a bridge, so to speak, from the ear drum to the far 
wall of the cavity. It is by means of these three bones that 
the vibrations of the ear drum are transmitted to the inner 
wall of the cavity. Behind the first cavity is a second cavity 
so complex and irregular that it is called the labyrinth of the 
ear. This labyrinth is filled with a fluid in which are spread 
out the delicate sensitive fibers of the auditory nerves; and it 
is to these that the vibrations must be transmitted. 
Suppose a note of 800 vibrations per second is sung. Then 
800 pulses of air will reach the ear each second, and the ear 
drum, being flexible, will respond and will vibrate at the same 
rate. The vibration of the ear drum will be transmitted by 
the three bones and the fluid to the fibers of the auditory 
nerves. The impulses imparted to the auditory nerve reach 
the brain and in some unknown way are translated into sound. 
278. Care of the Ear. Most catarrhal troubles are accom- 
panied by an oversupply of mucus which frequently clogs up the 
Eustachian tube and produces deafness. For the same reason, 
colds and sore throat sometimes induce temporary deafness. 
The wax of the ear is essential for flexibility of the ear drum ; 
if an extra amount accumulates, it can be got rid of by bathing 
the ear in hot water, since the heat will melt the wax. The 
wax should never be picked out with pin or sharp object except 
by a physician, lest injury be done to the tympanic membrane. 
279. The Phonograph. The invention of the phonograph 
by Edison in 1878 marked a new era in the popularity and 
dissemination of music. Up to that time, household music 
was limited to those who were rich enough to possess a real 
musical instrument, and who in addition had the understand- 
ing and the skill to use the instrument. The invention of the 
phonograph has brought music to thousands of homes pos-  
-P-A-G-E-304
    304 SPEAKING AND HEARING 
sessed of neither wealth nor skill. That the music reproduced 
by a phonograph is not always of. the highest order does 
not, in the least, detract from the interest and wonder of the 
instrument. It can reproduce what it is called upon to re- 
produce, and if human nature demands the commonplace, 
the instrument will be made to satisfy the demand. On the 
other hand, speeches of famous men, national songs, magnifi- 
cent opera selections, and other pleasing and instructive pro- 
ductions can be reproduced fairly accurately. In this way 
the phonograph, perhaps more than any other recent inven- 
tion, can carry to the “shut-ins”’ a lively glimpse of the out- 
side world and its doings. 
The phonograph consists of a cylinder or disk of wax upon 
which the vibrations of a sensitive diaphragm are recorded 
by means ofa fine metal 
point. The action of 
the pointer in report- 
ing the vibrations of 
a diaphragm is easily 
understood by refer- 
ence to a tuning fork.

means of wax, allow- 
ing the end of the point to rest lightly upon a piece of smoked 
glass. If the glass is drawn under the bristle a straight line 
will be scratched on the glass, but if the tuning fork is struck 
so that the prongs vibrate back and forth, then the straight 
line changes to a wavy line and the type of wavy line depends 
upon the fork used. 
In the phonograph, a diaphragm replaces the tuning fork 
and a cylinder (or a disk) coated with wax replaces the glass 
plate. When the speaker talks or the singer sings, his voice

strikes against a delicate diaphragm and throws it into vibra- 
tion, and the metal point attached to it traces on the wax of a 
moving cylinder a groove of varying shape and appearance 
called the “record.” Every variation in the speaker’s voice is 
repeated in the vibrations of the metal disk and hence in the 
minute motion of the pointer and in the consequent record

in this way is faint and weak, but can be strengthened by 
means of a trumpet attached to the phonograph.

possesses constructive, creative power, and is able to build on 
the information gained through the senses. It is the con- 
structive, creative power which raises man’ above the level of _ 
the beast and enables him to devise and: fashion wonderful 
inventions. Among the most important of his inventions are 
those which relate to electricity; inventions such as trolley 
car, elevator, automobile, electric light, the telephone, the 
telegraph. Bell, by his superior construc- 
tive ability, made possible the practical use of 
the telephone, and Marconi that of wireless 
telegraphy. To these inventions might be 
added thany others which have increased the 
efficiency and production of the business 
world and have decreased the labor and 
strain of domestic life.

to us was that of the lightning flash, which 
man could neither hinder nor make. But 
in the year 1800, electricity in the form of 
a weak current was obtained by Volta of 
Italy in a very simple way; and even now 
our various electric batteries and cells are but a modification 
of that used by Volta and called a voltaic cell. A strip of

  EXPERIMENTS WITH THE VOLTAIC CELL 307 
copper and a strip of zinc are placed in a glass containing 
dilute sulphuric acid, a solution composed of oxygen, hydro- 
gen, sulphur, and water. As soon as the plates are immersed 
in the acid solution, minute bubbles of gas rise from the zinc 
strip and it begins to waste away slowly. The solution 
gradually dissolves the zinc and at the same time gives up 
some of the hydrogen which it contains; but it has little or 
no effect on the copper, since there is no visible change in 
the copper strip. 
If, now, the strips are connected by means of metal wires, 
the zinc wastes away rapidly, numerous bubbles of hydrogen 
pass over to the copper strip and collect on it, and a current 
of electricity flows through the connecting wires. Evidently, 
the source of the current is the chemical action between the 
zinc and the liquid. 
Mere inspection of the connecting wire will not enable 
us to detect that a current is flowing, but there are vari- 
ous ways in which the current makes itself evident. If the 
ends of the wires attached to the strips are brought in con- 
tact with each other and then separated, a faint spark passes, 
and if the ends are placed on the tongue, a twinge is felt. 
282. Experiments which grew out of the Voltaic Cell. 
Since chemical action on the zinc is the source of the cur- 
rent, it would seem reasonable to expect a current if the cell 
consisted of two zinc plates instead of one zinc plate and 
one copper plate. But when the copper strip is replaced by 
a zinc strip so that the cell consists of two similar plates, no 
current flows between them. In this case, chemical action ‘is 
expended in heat rather than in the production of electricity 
and the liquid becomes hot. But if carbon and zinc are 
used, a current is again produced, the zinc dissolving away 
as before, and bubbles collecting on the carbon plate. By 
experiment it has been found that many different metals may
-P-A-G-E-308
    308 ELECTRICITY 
be employed in the construction of an electric cell; for ex- 
ample, current may be obtained from a cell made with a zinc 
plate and a platinum plate, or from. a cell made with a lead 
plate and a copper plate. . Then, too, some other chemical, 
such as bichromate of potassium, or ammonium chloride, may 
be used instead of dilute sulphuric acid. 
Almost any two different substances will, under proper 
conditions, give a current, but the strength of the current is 
in some cases so weak as to be worthless for practical use, 
such as telephoning, or ringing a door bell. What is wanted 
is astrong, steady current, and our choice of material is limited 
to the substances which will give this result. Zinc and lead 
can be'used, but the current resulting is weak and feeble, and 
for general use zinc and carbon are the most satisfactory. 
283. Electrical Terms. The plates or strips used in mak- 
ing an electric cell are called electrodes; the zinc is called the 
negative electrode (— ), and the carbon the positive elec- 
trode (+); the current is considered to flow through the wire 
from the + to the — electrode. As a rule, each electrode 
has attached to it a binding post to which wires can be 
quickly fastened. 
The power that causes the current is called the electro- 
motive force, and the value of the electromotive force, gen- 
erally written E. M. F., of a cell depends upon the materials 
used. 
When the cell consists of copper, zinc, and dilute sulphuric 
acid, the electromotive force has a definite value which is 
always the same no matter what the size or shape of the 
cell. But the E. M. F. has a decidedly different value in a 
cell composed of iron, copper, and chromic-acid. Each com- 
bination of material has its own specific electromotive force. 
284. The Disadvantage of a Simple Cell. When the poles 
of a simple voltaic cell are connected by a wire, the current
-P-A-G-E-309
    
THE GRAVITY CELL 309 
thus produced slowly diminishes in strength and, after a 
short time, becomes feeble. Examination of the cell shows 
that the copper plate is covered with hydrogen bubbles. If, 
however, these bubbles are completely brushed away by 
means of a rod or stick, the current strength increases, but as 
the bubbles again gather on the + electrode the current 
strength diminishes, and when the bubbles form a thick film 
on the copper plate, the current is too weak to be of any 
practical value. The film of bubbles weakens the current 
because it practically substitutes a hydrogen plate for a cop- 
per plate, and we saw in Section 282 that a change in any 
one of the materials of which a cell is composed changes the 
current. 
This weakening of the current can be reduced mechani- 
cally by brushing away the bubbles as soon as they are formed; 
or chemically, by surrounding the copper plate with a sub- 
stance which will combine with the free hydrogen and pre- 
vent it from passing onward to 
the copper plate. : 
In practically all cells, the 
chemical method is used in pref- 
erence to the mechanical one. 
The numerous types of cells in 
daily use differ chiefly in the de- 
vices employed for preventing 
the formation of hydrogen bub- 
bles, or for disposing of them when 
formed. One of the best-known 
cells in which weakening of the 
current is prevented by chemical FIG, 198. — The gravity cell, 
means is the so-called gravity cell. 
285. The Gravity Cell. A large, irregular copper elec- 
trode is placed in the bottom of a jar (Fig. 198), and com-     
   
-P-A-G-E-310
310 ELECTRICITY 
pletely, covered with a saturated solution of copper sulphate. 
Then a large, irregular zinc electrode is suspended from the 
top of the jar, and is completely covered with dilute sulphuric 
acid which does not mix with the copper sulphate, but floats 
on the top of it like oil on water. The hydrogen formed by 
the chemical action of the dilute sulphuric acid on the zinc 
moves toward the copper electrode, as in the simple voltaic 
cell. It does not reach the electrode, however, because, when 
it comes in contact with the copper sulphate, it changes places 
with the copper there, setting it free, but itself entering into 
the solution. The copper freed from the copper sulphate 
solution travels to the copper electrode, and is deposited 
on it in a clean, bright layer. Instead of a deposit of 
hydrogen there is a deposit of copper, and falling off in 
current is prevented. 
The gravity cell is cheap, easy to construct, and of constant 
strength, and is in almost universal use in telegraphic work. 
Practically all small railroad sta- 
tions and local telegraph. offices 
use these cells. 
286. Dry Cells: The gravity 
cell, while cheap and effective, is 
inconvenient for general use, owing 
to the fact that it cannot be easily 
transported, and the dry cell has 
largely supplanted all others, be- 
cause of the ease with which it 
can be taken from place to place. 
This cell consists of a zinc cup, 
within which is a carbon rod; the 
space between the cup and rod is packed with a moist paste’ 
containing certain chemicals. The moist paste takes the 
place of the liquids used in other cells.

cell may not give a current strong enough to ring a door bell 
or to operate a telephone. 
But by using a number of 
cells, called a battery, the 
current may be increased 
to almost any desired 
strength. If three cells are 
arranged as in Figure 200, 
so that the copper of one 
cell is connected with the

be three times as great as the E. M.F. of a single cell. If 
four cells are arranged in the same way, the E. M. F. of the 
battery is four times as great as the E. M. F. of a single cell; 
when five cells are combined, the resulting E. M. F. is five 
times as great.

CHAPTER XXXI 
SOME USES OF ELECTRICITY 
288. Heat. Any one who handles electric wires knows 
that they are more or less heated by the currents which flow 
through them. If three cells are arranged as in Figure 200 
and the connecting wire is coarse, the heating of the wire is 
scarcely noticeable; but if a shorter wire of the same kind 
is used, the heat produced is slightly greater; and if the 
coarse wire is replaced by a short, fine wire, the heating of 
the wire becomes very marked. We are accustomed to say 
that a wire offers resistance to the flow of a current; that 
is, whenever a current meets resistance, heat is produced 
in much the same way as when mechanical motion meets an 
obstacle and spends its energy in friction. The flow of elec- 
tricity along a wire can be compared to the flow of water 
through pipes: a small pipe offers a greater resistance to the 
flow of water than a large pipe; less water can be forced 
through a small pipe than through a large pipe, but the fric- 
tion of the water against the sides of the small pipe is much 
greater than in the large one. 
So it is with the electric current. In fine wires the resist- 
ance to the current is large and the energy of the battery is 
expended in heat rather than in current. If the heat thus 
produced is very great, serious consequences may arise; for 
example, the contact of a hot wire with wall paper or dry 
beams may cause fire. Insurance companies demand that 
the wires used in wiring a building for electric lights be of a 
312
-P-A-G-E-313
  
  ELECTRIC STOVES 313 
size suitable to the current to be carried, otherwise they will 
not take the risk of insurance. The greater the current to 
be carried, the coarser is the wire required for safety. 
289. Electric Stoves. It is often desirable to utilize the 
electric current for the production of heat. For example, 
trolley cars are heated by coils of wire 
under the seats. The coils offer so 
much resistance to the passage of a 
strong current through them that they 
become heated and warm the cars. 
Some modern houses are so built that 
electricity is received into them from the 
great plants where it is generated, and 
by merely turning a switch or inserting a F!¢- ot as neat arom 
plug, electricity is constantly available. 
In consequence, many practical applications of electricity 
are possible, among which are flatiron and toaster. 
Within the flatiron (Fig. 201), is a mass of fine wire coiled 
as shown in Figure 202; as soon as the iron is connected with 
the house supply of electricity, current flows through the fine 
wire which thus becomes strongly heated and gives off heat 
to the iron. The iron, when once 
heated, retains an even temperature 
as long as the current flows, and the 
laundress is, in consequence, free from 
Fic. 202. — The fine wires are the disadvantages of a slowly cooling 
strongly heated by the cur- iron, and of frequent substitution of rent which flows through : 5 them. a warm iron for a cold one. Electric 
irons are particularly valuable in sum- 
mer, because they eliminate the necessity for a strong fire, and 
spare the housewife intense heat. In addition, the user is not 
confined to the laundry, but is free to seek the coolest part of 
the house, the only requisite being an electrical connection. 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  314 SOME USES OF ELECTRICITY 
The toaster (Fig. 203) is another useful electrical device, 
since by means of it toast may be made on a dining table or 
at a bedside. The small electrical 
stove, shown in Figure 204, is similar 
in principle to the flatiron, but in it 
the heating coil is arranged as shown ' 
in Figure 205. To the physician 
electric stoves are valuable, since his 
instruments can be sterilized in water

A convenient device is seen in the heating pad (Fig. 206), 
a substitute for a hot water bag. 
Embedded in some soft thick sub- 
stance are the insulated wires in 
which heat is to be developed, and 
over this is placed a covering of felt. 
290. Electric Lights. The incan- 
descent bulbs which illuminate our Fie, 204.—An electric stove. 
buildings consist of a fine, hairlike 
thread inclosed in a glass bulb from which the air has been 
removed. When an electric current is sent _ 
through the delicate filament, it meets a strong 
resistance. The heat developed in overcom- 
ing the resistance is so great that it makes 
the filament a glowing mass. The absence 
of air prevents the filament from burning, 
and it merely glows and radiates the light. 
      Bee esc tue 291. Blasting. Until recently, dynamit- 
electric stove. ing was attended with serious danger, owing 
to the fact that the person who applied 
the torch to the fuse could not make a safe retreat before 
the explosion. Now a fine wire is inserted in the fuse, and

when everything is in readiness, the ends of the wire are 
attached to the poles of a distant battery and the heat de- 
veloped in the wire ignites the

Metals are fused and welded by 
the use of the electric current.

293. Chemical Effects. Zhe Plating of Gold, Silver, and 
Other Metals. If strips of lead or rods of 
carbon are connected to the terminals of 
an electric cell, as in Figure 208, and are 
then dipped into a solution of copper sul- 
phate, the strip in connection with the neg- 
ative terminal of the cell soon becomes thinly 
plated with a coating of copper. Ifa solu- 
tion of silver nitrate is used in place of the 
copper sulphate, the coating formed will be 
of silver instead of copper. So long as the 
current flows and there is any metal present 
in the solution, the coating continues to 
form on the negative electrode, and becomes

electric current can separate a liquid into some of its various 
constituents and to deposit one of the metal constituents on 
    
  
  FIG, 208. — Carbon rods in a solution 
of copper sulphate, the negative electrode. 
Since copper is constantly 
taken out of the solution of cop- 
per sulphate for deposit upon the 
negative electrode, the amount of 
copper remaining in the solution 
steadily decreases, and finally there 
is none of it left for deposit. In 
order to overcome this, the posi- 
tive electrode should be made of 
the same metal as that which is 
to be deposited. The positive metal electrode gradually dis- 
solves and replaces the metal lost from the solution by deposit 
and electroplating can continue as long as any positive 
electrode remains. 
Practically all silver, gold, and 
nickel plating is done in this way ; 
machine, bicycle, and motor attach- 
ments are not solid, but are of 
cheaper material electrically plated 
with nickel. When spoons are to 
be plated, they are hung in a bath 
of silver nitrate side by side with 
a thick slab of pure silver, as in 
Figure 209. The spoons are con- 
nected with the negative terminal 
of the battery, while the slab of 
pure silver is connected with the 
positive terminal of the same bat-

tery. The length of time that the current flows determines 
the thickness of the plating.

294. How Pure Metal is obtained from Ore. When ore is 
mined, it contains in addition to the desired metal many other 
substances. In order to separate out the desired metal, the 
ore is placed in some suitable acid bath, and is connected with 
the positive terminal of a battery, thus taking the place of 
the silver slab in the last Section. When current flows, 
any pure metal which is present is dissolved out of the ore 
and is deposited on a convenient negative electrode, while 
the impurities remain in the ore or drop as sediment to the 
bottom of the vessel. Metals separated from the ore by 
electricity are called electrolytic metals and are the purest 
obtainable. 
295. Printing. The ability of the electric current to de- 
compose a liquid and to deposit a metal constituent has prac- 
tically revolutionized the process of printing. Formerly, type 
was arranged and retained in position until the required num- 
ber of impressions had been made, the type meanwhile being 
unavailable for other uses. Moreover, the printing of a sec- 
ond edition necessitated practically as great labor as did the 
first edition, the type being necessarily set afresh. Now, how- 
ever, the type is set up and a mold of itis taken in wax. This 
mold is coated with graphite to make it a conductor and is 
then suspended in a bath of copper sulphate, side by side 
with a slab of pure copper. Current is sent through the 
solution as described in Section 293, until a thin coating of 
copper has been deposited on the mold, The mold is then 
taken from the bath, and the wax is replaced by some metal 
which gives strength and support to the thin copper plate. 
From this copper plate, which is an exact reproduction of the 
original type, many thousand copies can be printed. The 
plate can be preserved and used from time to time for later 
editions, and the original type can be put back into the cases 
and used again.

296. An Electric Current acts like a Magnet. In order to 
understand the action of the electric bell, we must consider a 
third effect which an electric current can cause. Connect 
some cells as shown in Figure 200 and close the circuit 
| through a stout heavy copper wire, 
ee ia dipping a portion of the wire into 
ss fine iron filings. A thick cluster 
of filings will adhere to the wire 
(Fig. 210), and will continue to

t flows. Ifthe current is broken, the 
filings fall from the wire, and only so long as the current flows 
through the wire does the wire have power to attract iron 
filings. An electric current makes a wire equivalent to a 
magnet, giving it the power to attract iron filings. 
Although such a straight current bearing wire attracts iron 
filings, its power of attraction is very small; but its magnetic 
strength can be a3097

an arrangement fi wire 
is known as a helix or solenoid, and is capable of lifting or 
pulling larger and more numerous filings and even good- 
sized pieces of iron, such as tacks. Filings do not adhere 
to the sides of the helix, but they cling in clusters to the ends 
318     SS   
 
-P-A-G-E-319
THE ELECTRIC BELL 319 
of the coil. This shows that the ends of the helix have mag- 
netic power but not the sides. 
If a soft iron nail (Fig. 212) or its equivalent is slipped 
within the coil, the lifting and attractive power of the coil is 
increased, and comparatively heavy weights can be lifted. 
A coil of wire traversed by an electric current 
and containing a core of soft iron has the power 
of attracting and moving heavy iron objects; that is, 
it acts like a magnet. Such an arrangement is 
called an electromagnet. As soon as the current 
ceases to flow, the electromagnet loses its magnetic 
power and becomes merely iron and wire without 
magnetic attraction. 
If many cells are used, the strength of the electro- J 
magnet is increased, and if the coil is wound closely, jy¢, o10,— 
as in Figure 213, instead of loosely, as in Figure a iG 
211, the magnetic strength is still further increased. roa, 
The strength of any electromagnet 
depends upon the number of coils wound on 
the iron core and upon the strength of the 
current which is sent through the coils. 
To increase the strength of the electromagnet 
still further, the so-called horseshoe shape is 
used (Fig. 214). In such an arrangement there 
is practically the strength of two separate elec- 
tromagnets. ,

clapper to strike the bell. In this position, 
S no longer touches the screw P, and 
hence there is no complete path for the 
electricity, and the current ceases. But 
the attractive, magnetic power of the 
coils stops as soon as the current ceases; 
hence there is nothing to hold the arma- 
ture down, and it flies back to its former 
position, 
In doing 
this, how- 
ever, the 
armature makes contact at 
P through the spring, and 
the current flows once more; 
as aresult the coils again 
become magnets, the ar- 
mature is again drawn for- 
ward, and the clapper again 
strikes the bell. But imme- 
diately afterwards the ar- 
mature springs backward 
and makes contact at P / 
and the entire operation is ['(j 
repeated. So long as we 
press the button this process 
continues producing what 
sounds like a continuous

current passes through the electromagnet.

HOW ELECTRICITY MAY BE LOST TO USE 321 
298. The Push Button. The push button is an essential 
part of every electric bell, because without it the bell either 
would not ring at all, or would ring incessantly until the cell 
was exhausted. When the push button is free, as in Fig- 
ure 216, the cell terminals are not connected in an unbroken 
path, and hence the current does 
not flow. When, however, the 
button is pressed, the current hasa 
complete path, provided there is 
the proper connection at S$. That 
is, the pressure on the push button permits current to flow 
to the bell. The flow of this current then depends solely 
upon the connection at S, which is alternately made and 
broken, and in this way produces sound. 
The sign “Bell out of order” is usually due to the fact that 
the battery is either temporarily or permanently exhausted. 
In warm weather the liquid in the cell may dry up and cause 
stoppage of the current. If fresh liquid is poured into the 
vessel so that the chemical action of the acid on the zinc is 
renewed, the current again flows. Another explanation of 
an out-of-order bell is that the liquid may have eaten up all 
the zinc; if this is the case, the insertion of a fresh strip 
of zinc will remove the difficulty and the current will flow. 
If dry cells are used, there is no remedy except in the pur- 
chase of new cells. 
299. How Electricity may be lost to Use. In the electric 
bell, we saw that an air gap at the push button stopped the flow 
of electricity. If we cut the wire connecting the poles of a 
battery, the current ceases because an air gap intervenes 
and electricity does not readily pass through air. Many sub- 
stances besides air stop the flow of electricity. If a strip of 
glass, rubber, mica, or paraffin is introduced anywhere in a 
circuit, the current ceases. If a metal is inserted in the gap, 
CL. GEN, SCI,— 21 
  FIG. 216. — Push button,
-P-A-G-E-322
322 ‘MODERN ELECTRICAL INVENTIONS 
the current again flows. Substances which, like an air gap, 
interfere with the flow of electricity are called non-conduc- 
tors, or, more commonly, insulators. Substances which, like 
the earth, the human body, and all other moist objects, con- 
duct electricity are conductors. If the telephone and electric 
light wires in our houses were not insulated by a covering of 
thread, or cloth, or other non-conducting material, the elec- 
tricity would escape into surrounding objects instead of flow- 
ing through the wire and producing sound and light. 
In our city streets, the overhead wires are supported on 
glass knobs or are closely wrapped, in order to prevent the 
escape of electricity through the poles to the ground. In 
order to have a steady, dependable current, the wire carry- 
ing the current must be insulated. 
Lack of insulation means not only the loss of current for 
practical uses, but also serious consequences in the event of 
the crossing of current-bearing wires: If two wires properly 
insulated touch each other, the currents flow along their 
respective wires unaltered; if, however, two uninsulated 
wires touch, some of the electricity flows from one to the 
other. Heat is developed as a result of this transference, 
and the heat thus developed is sometimes so great that fire 
occurs. For this reason, wires are heavily insulated and 
extra protection is provided at points where numerous wires 
touch or cross. 
Conductors and insulators are necessary to the efficient 
and economic flow of a current, the insulator preventing the 
escape of electricity and lessening the danger of fire, and 
the conductor carrying the current. 
300. The Telegraph. Telegraphy is the process of trans- 
mitting messages from place to place by means of an electric 
current. The principle underlying the action of the tele- 
graph is the principle upon which the electric bell operates ;
-P-A-G-E-323
THE TELEGRAPH 323 
namely, that a piece of soft iron becomes a magnet while a 
current flows around it, but loses its magnetism as soon as 
the current ceases. 
In the electric bell, the electromagnet, clapper, push button, 
and battery are relatively near, — usually all are located in

the same building; while in the telegraph the current may 
travel miles before it reaches the electromagnet and produces 
motion of the armature. 
The fundamental connections of the telegraph are shown 
in Figure 217. If the key K is pressed down by an operator 
in Philadelphia, the current from the battery (only one cell 
is shown for simplicity) flows through the line to New York, 
passes through the electromagnet J/, and thence back to Phila- 
delphia. As long as the key X is pressed down, the coil 17 
acts as a magnet and attracts and holds fast the armature A ; 
but as soon as XK is released, the current is broken, JZ loses 
its magnetism, and the armature is pulled back by the spring 
D. By a mechanical device, tape is drawn uniformly under 
the light marker P attached to the armature. If X is closed 
for but a short time, the armature is drawn down for but 
a short interval, and the marker registers a dot on the tape. 
If K is closed for a longer time, a short dash is made by the 
marker, and, in general, the length of time that K is closed 
determines the length of the marks recorded on the tape. 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
  324 MODERN ELECTRICAL INVENTIONS 
The telegraphic alphabet consists of dots and dashes and 
their various combinations, and hence an interpretation of 
the dot and dash symbols recorded on the tape is all that is 
necessary for the receiving of a telegraphic message. 
The Morse telegraphic code, consisting of dots, dashes, and 
spaces, is given in Figure 218.

was conducted before its invention in 1832 by S. F. B. Morse. 
301. Improvements. Zhe Sounder. Shortly after the in- 
vention of telegraphy, operators learned that they could read 
the message by the click of the marker against a metal rod 
which took the place of the 
tape. In practically all tele- 
graph offices of the present 
day the old-fashioned tape 
is replaced by the sounder, 
shown in Figure 219. When 
— current flows, a lever, Z, is 
drawn down by the electro- 
magnet and strikes against 
a solid metal piece with a click; when the current is broken, 
the lever springs upward, strikes another metal piece and 
makes a different click. It is clear that the working of the 
key which starts and stops the current in this line will be imi-

tated by the motion and the resulting clicks of the sounder. 
By means of these varying clicks of the sounder, the opera- 
tor interprets the message. 
The Relay. When a telegraph line is very long, the re- 
sistance of the wire is great, and the current which passes 
through the electromagnet is correspondingly weak, so feeble 
indeed that the armature must be made very thin and light

in order to be affected by the makes and breaks in the 
current. The clicks of an armature light enough to respond 
to the weak current of a long wire are too faint to be recogniz- 
able by the ear, and hence in such long circuits some device 
must be introduced whereby the effect is increased. This is 
usually done by installing at each station a local battery and 
a very delicate and sensitive electromagnet called the relay. 
Under these conditions the current of the main line is not 
sent through the sounder, but through the relay which opens 
and closes a local battery in connection with the strong
-P-A-G-E-326
    326 MODERN ELECTRICAL INVENTIONS 
sounder. For example, the relay is so arranged that current 
from the main line runs through it exactly as it runs through 
M in Figure 217.. When current is made, the relay attracts 
an armature, which thereby closes a circuit in a local battery 
and thus causes a click of the sounder. When the current 
in the main line is broken, the relay loses its magnetic attrac- 
tion, its armature springs back, connection is broken in the 
local circuit, and the sounder responds by allowing its arma- 
ture to spring back with a sharp sound. 
302. The Earth an Important Part of a Telegraphic System. 
We learned in Section 299 that electricity could flow through 
many different substances, one of which was the earth. In 
all ordinary telegraph lines, advantage is taken of this fact 
to utilize the earth as a conductor and to dispense with 
one wire. Originally two wires were used, as in Figure 217; 
then it was found that a railroad track could be substituted 
for one wire, and later that the earth itself served equally 
well for a return wire. The present arrangement is shown 
in Figure 220, where there is but one wire, the circuit being 
completed by the earth. No fact in electricity seems more 
marvelous than that the thousands of messages flashing along 
the wires overhead are likewise traveling through the ground 
beneath. If it were not for this use of the earth as an un- 
failing conductor, the network of overhead wires in our city 
streets would be even more complex than it now is. 
303. Advances in Telegraphy. The mechanical improve- 
ments in telegraphy have been so rapid that at present a 
single operator can easily send or receive forty words a 
minute. He can telegraph more quickly than the average 
person can write; and with a combination of the latest im- 
provements the speed can be enormously increased. 
In actual practice messages are not ordinarily sent long 
distances over a direct line, but are automatically transferred’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  ’ ADVANCES IN TELEGRAPHY 327 
to new lines at definite points. For example, a message from 
New York to Chicago does not travel along an uninterrupted 
path, but is automatically transferred at some point, such as 
Lancaster, to a second line which carries it on to Pittsburgh, 
where it is again transferred to a third line which takes it 
farther on to its destination.

CHAPTER XXXITI 
MAGNETS AND CURRENTS 
304. In the twelfth century, there was introduced into 
Europe from China a simple instrument which changed jour- 
neying on the sea from uncertain wandering to a definite, safe 
voyage. This instrument was the compass (Fig. 221), and be- 
cause of the property of the compass 
needle (a magnet) to point unerr- 
ingly north and south, sailors were 
able to determine directions on the 
sea and to steer for the desired 
" point. 
Since an electric current is prac- 
tically equivalent to a magnet (Sec- 
tion 296), it becomes necessary to 
know the most important facts 
relative to magnets, facts simple in 
themselves but of far-reaching 
value and consequences in electric- 
ity. Without a knowledge of the magnetic characteristics of 
currents, the construction of the motor would have been 
impossible, and trolley cars, electric fans, motor boats, and 
other equally well-known electrical contrivances would be un- 
known. 
305. The Attractive Power of a Magnet. The magnet best 
known to us all is the compass needle, but for convenience 
328 
  FIG. 221. — The compass.
-P-A-G-E-329
  THE EXTENT OF MAGNETIC ATTRACTION 329 
we will use a magnetic needle in the shape of a bar larger 
and stronger than that employed in the compass. If we 
lay such a magnet on a pile of iron filings, it will be found 
on lifting the magnet that the filings cling to the ends in 
tufts, but leave it almost bare in the center (Fig. 222). The 
points of attraction at 
the two ends are called 
the poles of the mag- 
net. 
If a delicately made 
magnet is suspended 
as in Figure 223, and 
is allowed to swing 
freely, it will always 
assume a definite north 
and south position.. The pole which points north when the 
needle is suspended is called the north pole and is marked 
NV, while the pole which points south when the needle is 
suspended is called the south pole and is marked S. 
A freely suspended magnet points nearly north and south. 
A magnet has two main points of attraction 
called respectively the north and south poles. 
306. The Extent of Magnetic Attraction. If 
a thin sheet of paper or cardboard is laid over a 
strong, bar-shaped magnet and iron filings are 
Fic, 223,The then gently strewn on the paper, the filings 
‘ meee ke clearly indicate the position of the magnet be- 
neath, and if the cardboard is gently tapped, the 
filings arrange themselves as shown in Figure 224. If the 
paper is held some distance above the magnet, the influence 
on the filings is less definite, and finally, if the paper is held 
very far away, the filings do not respond at all, but lie on 
the cardboard as dropped. 
  FIG, 222.— A magnet.
-P-A-G-E-330
330 MAGNETS AND CURRENTS 
The magnetic power of a magnet, while not confined to 
the magnet itself, does not extend indefinitely into the sur- 
rounding region; the influence is strong near the magnet, 
but at a distance becomes so weak as to be inappreciable. 
The region around a magnet through which its magnetic

force is felt is called the field of force, or simply the magnetic 
field, and the definite lines in which the filings arrange them- 
selves are called lines of force. 
The magnetic power of a magnet is not limited to the 
magnet, but extends to a considerable distance in all direc- 
tions. 
307. The Influence of Magnets upon Each Other. If while 
our suspended magnetic needle is at rest in its characteristic 
north-and-south direction another magnet is brought near, 
the suspended magnet is turned; that is, motion is produced 
(Fig. 225). If the north pole of the free magnet is brought 
toward the south pole of the suspended magnet, the latter 
moves in such a way that the two poles Vand S are as close 
together as possible. If the north pole of the free magnet
-P-A-G-E-331
  ELECTRICITY AS A MAGNET 331 
is brought toward the north pole of the suspended magnet, 
the latter moves in such a way that the two poles V and V 
are as far apart as possible. In every case that can be 
‘tested, it is found that a north pole repels a north pole, and a 
south pole repels a south 
pole; but that a north and 
a south pole always attract 
each other. 
The main facts relative to 
magnets may be summed up 
as follows :— 
a. A magnet points 
nearly north and south if it 
is allowed to swing freely. 
6. A magnet contains two unlike poles, one of which per- 
sistently points north, and the other of which as persistently 
points south, if allowed to swing freely. 
c. Poles of the same name repel each other; poles of un- 
like name attract each other. 
d. A magnet possesses the power of attracting certain sub- 
stances, like iron, and this power of attraction is not limited 
to the magnet itself but extends into the region around the 
magnet. 
308. Magnetic Properties of an Electric Current. If a cur- 
rent-bearing wire is really equivalent in its magnetic powers 
to a magnet, it must possess all of the characteristics men- 
tioned in the preceding Section. We saw in Section 296 that 
a coiled wire through which current was flowing would attract 
iron filings at the two ends of the helix. That a coil through 
which current flows possesses the characteristics a, 6, c, and 
d@ of a magnet is shown as follows :— 
a, 6. If a helix marked at one end with a red string is 
arranged so that it is free to rotate and a strong current is

-P-A-G-E-332
332 MAGNETS AND CURRENTS 
sent through it, the helix will’ immediately turn and face 
about until it points north and south. If it is disturbed from 
this position, it will slowly swing back until it occupies its 
characteristic north and south 
position. The end to which 
the string is attached will per- 
sistently point either north or 
south. If the current is sent 
through the coil in the opposite 
direction, the two poles ex- 
change positions and the helix 
turns until the new north pole 
points north.

pended magnet, one end of 
the helix will be found to attract the north pole of the magnet, 
while the opposite end will be found to repel the north pole of 
the magnet. In fact, the helix will be found to behave in every 
way as a magnet, with a 
north pole at one endanda 
south pole attheother, If 
the current is sent through 
the helix in the opposite di- 
rection, the north and south 
poles exchange places. 
If the number of turns 
in the helix is reduced until 
but a single loop remains, 
the result is the same; the 
single loop acts like a flat magnet, one side of the loop always 
facing northward and-one southward, and one face attracting 
the north pole of the suspended magnet and one repelling it.

is surrounded by a field of magnetic force.
-P-A-G-E-333
THE PRINCIPLE OF THE MOTOR 333 
d. If a wire is passed through a card and a strong current 
is sent through the wire, iron filings will, when sprinkled 
upon the card, arrange themselves in definite directions 
(Fig. 227). A wire carrying a current is surrounded by a 
magnetic field of force. 
A magnetic needle held under a current-bearing wire turns 
on its pivot and finally comes to rest at an angle with the 
current. The fact that the needle is deflected by the wire 
shows that the magnetic power of the wire extends into the 
surrounding medium. 5 
The magnetic properties of current electricity were discov- 
ered by Oersted of Denmark less than a hundred years ago; 
but since that time practically all important electrical ma- 
chinery has been based upon one or more of the magnetic 
properties of electricity. The motors which drive our electric 
fans, our mills, and our trolley cars owe their existence en- 
tirely to the magnetic action of current 
electricity. 
309. The Principle of the Motor. If a 
close coil of wire is suspended between the 
poles of a strong horseshoe magnet, it will 
not assume any characteristic position but 
will remain wherever placed. If, however, 
a current is sent through the wire, the coil 
faces about and assumes a definite position. 
This is because a coil, carrying a current, Fic. 228.—The coil 
is equivalent to a magnet with a north and fms in such oe 
south face; and, in accordance with the opposite the south 
magnetic laws, tends to move until its north _P!* ofthe magnet. 
face is opposite the south pole of the horseshoe magnet, and 
its south face opposite the north pole of the magnet. If, 
when the coil is at rest in this position, the current is reversed, 
so that the north pole of the coil becomes a south pole and To battery 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  334 MAGNETS AND CURRENTS 
the former south pole becomes a north pole, the result is that 
like poles of coil and magnet face each other. But since 
like poles repel each other, the coil will move, and will rotate 
until its new north pole is opposite to the south pole of the 
magnet and its new south pole is opposite the north pole. 
By sending a strong current through the coil, the helix is 
made to rotate through a half turn; by reversing the current 
when the coil is at the half turn, the helix is made to con- 
tinue its rotation and to swing through a whole turn. If 
the current could be repeatedly reversed just as the helix 
completed its half turn, the motion could be prolonged; 
periodic current reversal would produce continuous rotation. 
This is the principle of the motor. 
It is easy to see that long-continued rotation would be im- 
possible in the arrangement of Figure 228, since the twisting 
of the suspending wire would interfere with free motion. If 
the motor is to be used for continuous motion, some device 
must be employed by means of which the helix is capable of 
continued rotation 
around its support. 
In practice, the rotat- 
ing coil of a motor is 
arranged as shown in 
‘Figure 229. Wires from 
the coil terminate on 
metal disks and are se- 
curely soldered there. 
Fic. 229.— Principle of the motor. The coil and disks are 
supported by the strong 
and well-insulated rod R, which rests upon braces, but which 
nevertheless rotates freely with disks and coil. The current 
flows to the coil through the thin metal strips called brushes, 
which rest lightly upon the disks. 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
    
MECHANICAL REVERSAL OF THE CURRENT — 335 
When the current which enters at B flows through the 
wire, the coil rotates, tending to set itself so that its north 
face is opposite the south face of the magnet. If, when the 
helix has just reached this position, the current is reversed — 
entering at 4’ instead of —the poles of the coil are ex- 
changed ; the rotation, therefore, does not cease, but continues 
for another half turn. Proper reversals of the current are 
accompanied by continuous motion, and since the disk and 
shaft rotate with the coil, there is continuous rotation. 
If a wheel is attached to the rotating shaft, weights can be 
lifted, and if a belt is attached to the wheel, the motion of 
the rotating helix can be transferred to machinery for prac- 
tical use. 
The rotating coil is usually spoken of as the armature, and 
the large magnet as the field magnet. 
310. Mechanical Reversal of the Current. Zhe Com- 
mutator. It is not possible by hand to reverse the current 
with sufficient rapidity and precision to insure uninterrupted 
rotation; moreover, the physical exertion of such frequent 
reversals is considerable. Hence, some mechanical device 
for periodically reversing the current is necessary, if the 
motor is to be of com- 
mercial value. 
The mechanical re- 
versal of the current is 
accomplished by the 
use of the commutator, 
which is a metal ring 
split into halves, well 
insulated from each 
other and from the 
shaft. To each half of this ring is attached one of the ends of 
the armature wire. The brushes which carry the current are set 
  FIG, 230. — The commutator, 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  336 MAGNETS AND CURRENTS 
on opposite sides of the ring and do not rotate. As armature, 
commutator, and shaft rotate, the brushes connect first with 
one segment of the commutator and then with the other. 
Since the circuit is arranged so that the current always 
enters the commutator through the brush JS, the flow of the 
current into the coil is always through the segment in contact 
with B; but the segment in contact with B changes at every 
half turn of the coil, and hence the direction of the current 
through the coil changes periodically. As a result the coil 
rotates continuously, and produces motion so long as current 
is supplied from without. 
311. The Practical Motor. A motor constructed in accord- 
ance with Section 309 would be of little value in practical 
everyday affairs; its armature rotates too slowly and with 
too little force. If a motor is to be of real service, its arma- 
ture must rotate with sufficient strength to impart motion to 
the wheels of trolley cars and mills, to drive electric fans, and 
to set into activity many other forms of machinery. 
The strength of a motor may be increased by replacing the 
singly coiled armature by one closely wound on an iron 
core; in some armatures there are thousands of turns of 
wire. The presence of soft iron within the armature (Section 
296) causes greater attraction between the armature and the 
outside magnet, and hence greater force of motion. The 
magnetic strength of the field magnet influences greatly the 
speed of the armature; the stronger the field magnet the greater 
the motion, so electricians make every effort to strengthen 
their field magnets. The strongest known magnets are elec- 
tromaghets, which, as we have seen, are merely coils of wire 
wound on an iron core. For this reason, the field magnet is 
usually an electromagnet. 
When very powerful motors are necessary, the field mag- 
net is so arranged that it has four or more poles instead of
-P-A-G-E-337
  THE PRACTICAL MOTOR 337 
two; the armature likewise consists of several portions, and 
even the commutator may be very complex. But no matter 
  
Paes 
  FIG. 231.— A modern power plant. 
how complex these various parts may seem to be, the prin- 
ciple is always that stated in Section 309, and the parts are 
limited to field magnet, commutator, and armature. 
The motor is of value because by means of it motion, or 
mechanical energy, is obtained from an electric current.

CHAPTER XXXIV 
HOW ELECTRICITY MAY BE MEASURED 
312. Danger of an Oversupply of Current. If a small toy 
motor is connected with one cell, it rotates slowly; if con- 
nected with two cells, it rotates more rapidly, and in general, 
the greater the number of cells used, the stronger will be the 
action of the motor. But it is possible to send too strong 
a current through our wire, thereby interfering with all mo- 
tion and destroying the motor. We have seen in Section 
288 that the amount of current which can safely flow through 
a wire depends upon the thickness of the wire. A strong 
current sent through a fine wire has its electrical energy 
transformed largely into heat; and if the current is very 
strong, the heat developed may be sufficient to burn off the 
insulation and melt the wire itself. This is true not only of 
motors, but of all electric machinery in which there are cur- 
rent-bearing wires. The current should not be greater than 
the wires can carry, otherwise too much heat will be developed 
and damage will be done to instruments and surroundings. 
The current sent through our electric stoves and irons 
should be strong enough to heat the coils, but not strong 
enough to melt them. If the current sent through our electric 
light wires is too great for the capacity of the wires, the heat 
developed will injure the wires and may cause disastrous 
results. The overloading of wires is responsible for many 
disastrous fires. 
339  
-P-A-G-E-340
340 HOW ELECTRICITY MAY BE MEASURED 
The danger of overloading may be eliminated by inserting 
in the circuit a fuse or other safety device. A fuse is made 
by combining a number of metals in such a way that the 
resulting substance has a low melting point and a high elec- 
trical resistance. A fuse is inserted in the circuit, and the 
instant the current increases beyond its normal amount the 
fuse melts, breaks the circuit, and thus protects the remain- 
ing part of the circuit from the danger of an overload. In 
this way, a circuit designed to carry a certain current is pro- 
tected from the danger of an accidental overload. The noise 
made by the burning out of a fuse in a trolley car fre- 
quently alarms passengers, but it is really a sign that the 
system is in good working order and that there is no danger 
of accident from too strong a current. 
313. How Current is Measured. The preceding Section has 
shown clearly the danger of too strong a current, and the 
necessity for limiting the current to that which the wire can 
safely carry. There are times when it is desirable to know 
accurately the strength of a current, not only in order to 
guard against an overload, but also in order to determine in 
advance the mechanical and chemical effects which will 
be produced by the current. For example, the strength of 
the current determines the thickness of the coating of silver 
which forms in a given time on a spoon placed in an electro- 
lytic bath; if the current is weak, a thin plating is made on 
the spoon; if the current is strong, a thick plating is made. 
If, therefore, the exact value of the current is known, the 
exact amount of silver which will be deposited on the spoon 
in a given time can be definitely calculated. 
Current-measuring instruments, or galvanometers, depend 
for their action on the magnetic properties of current elec- 
tricity. The principle of practically all galvanometers is as 
follows : —  
-P-A-G-E-341
  AMMETERS 341 
A closely wound coil of fine wire free to rotate is sus- 
pended as in Figure 233 between the poles of a strong mag- 
net. When a current is sent through the coil, the coil 
becomes a magnet and turns so that its : ) 
faces will be towards the poles of the per- 
manent magnet. But as the coil turns, the 
suspending wire becomes twisted and hin- 
ders the turning. For this reason, the coil 
"can turn only until the motion caused by the 
current is balanced by the twist of the sus- 
pending wire. But the stronger the cur- 
rent through the coil, the stronger will be 
the force tending to rotate the coil, and 
hence the less effective will be the hin- 
drance of the twisting string. As a conse- 
quence, the coil swings farther than before ; 
that is, the greater the current, the farther FIG; 993. 22"Ehe" pn 
the swing. Usually a delicate pointer is ple of the galvanome- 
attached to the movable coil and rotates ‘" 
freely with it, so that the swing of the pointer indicates the 
relative values of the current. If the source of the cur- 
rent is a gravity cell, the swing is only two thirds as great 
as when a dry cell is used, indicating that the dry cell fur- 
nishes about 1} times as much current as a gravity cell. 
314. Ammeters. A galvanometer does not measure the 
current, but merely indicates the relative strength of different 
currents. But it is desirable at times to measure a current 
in units. Instruments for measuring the strength of currents 
in units are called ammeters, and the common form makes      ‘NV 
use of a galvanometer. 
A current is sent through a movable coil (the field magnet 
and coil are inclosed in the case) (Fig. 234), and the magnetic 
field thus developed causes the coil to turn, and the pointer
-P-A-G-E-342
    342 HOW ELECTRICITY MAY BE MEASURED 
attached to it to move over a scale graduated so that it reads 
current strengths. This scale is carefully graduated by the 
following method. § 
If two silver rods (Fig. 208) are weighed and placed in a 
solution of silver nitrate, and current from a single cell is 
passed through the liquid for a definite time, we find, on 
weighing the two rods, that one has gained in weight and 
the other has lost. If the current is allowed to flow twice 
as long, the amount of silver lost and gained by the elec- 
trodes is doubled; and if twice the current is used, the result 
is again doubled. 
As a result of numerous experiments, it was found that a 
definite current of electricity will deposit a definite amount 
of silver in a definite time, and that the amount of silver 
deposited on an electrode in one second might be used to 
measure the current of electricity which has flowed through 
the circuit in one second. 
A current is said to be one ampere strong if it will deposit 
silver on an electrode at the rate of .oo1118 gram per second. 
In marking the scale, 
an ammeter is placed in 
the circuit of an electro- 
lytic cell and the position of 
the pointer is marked on 
the blank card which lies 
beneath and which is to 
serveas a scale (Fig. 235). 
After the current has 
flowed for about an hour, 
the amount of silver which 
has been deposited is meas- 
ured. Knowing the time during which the current has 
run, and the amount of deposit, the strength of the cur-      
  Fic. 234. — An ammeter.
-P-A-G-E-343
  VOLTAGE AND VOLTMETERS 343 
rent in amperes can be calculated. This number is written 
opposite the place at which the pointer stood during the ex- 
periment. 
The scale may be completed by marking the positions of the 
pointer when other currents of known strength flow through 
the ammeter. 
All electric plants, whether for heating, lighting, or for 
machinery, are provided with ammeters, such instruments

315. Voltage and Voltmeters. Since electromotive force, or 
voltage, is the cause of current, it should be possible to com- 
pare different electromotive forces by comparing the currents 
which they produce in a given circuit. But two voltages of 
equal value do not give equal currents unless the resistances 
met by the currents are equal. For example, the simple 
voltaic cell and the gravity cell have approximately equal 
voltages, but the current produced by the voltaic cell is 
stronger than that.produced by the gravity cell. This is be- 
cause the current meets more resistance within the gravity  
-P-A-G-E-344
344. HOW ELECTRICITY MAY BE MEASURED 
cell than within the voltaic cell. Every cell, no matter what 
its nature, offers resistance to the flow of electricity through it 
and is said to have internal resistance. If we are determin- 
ing the voltages of various cells by a comparison of the 
respective currents produced, the result will be true only 
on condition that the resistances in the various circuits are 
equal. If a very large external resistance of fine wire is 
placed in circuit with a gravity cell, the fo¢a/ resistance of the 
circuit (made up of the relatively small resistance in the cell 
and the larger resistance in the rest of the circuit) will differ 
but little from that of another circuit in which the gravity 
cell is replaced by a voltaic cell, or any other type of cell. 
With a high resistance in the outside circuit, the deflections 
of the ammeter will be small, but such as they are, they will 
fairly accurately represent the electromotive forces which 
produce them. ‘ 
Voltmeters (Fig. 236), or instruments for measuring volt- 
age, are like ammeters except that a wire of very high 
resistance is in circuit 
with the movable coil." In 
external appearance they 
are not distinguishable 
from ammeters. 
The unit of electromo- 
tive force is called the vo/t. 
The voltage of a dry cell 
is approximately 1.5 volts, 
and the voltage of a voltaic 
cell and of a gravity cell 
is approximately 1 volt. 
316. Current, Voltage, Resistance. We learned in Section 
287 that the strength of a current increases when the electro- - 
motive force increases, and diminishes when the electromotive 
  FIG, 236. — A voltmeter.
-P-A-G-E-345
RESISTANCE 345 
force diminishes. Later, in Section 288, we learned that the 
strength of the current decreases as the resistance in circuit 
increases. 
The strength of a steady current depends upon these two 
factors only, the electromotive force which causes it and the 
resistance which it has to overcome. 
317. Resistance. Since resistance plays so important a réle 
in electricity, it becomes necessary to have a unit of resist- 
ance. The practical unit of resistance is called an ohm, and 
some idea of the value of an ohm can be obtained if we 
remember that a 300-foot length of common iron telegraph 
wire has a resistance of 1 ohm. An approximate ohm for 
rough work in the laboratory may be made by winding 9 feet 
5 inches of number 30 copper wire on a spool or arranging 
it in any other convenient form. 
In Section 299 we learned that substances differ very 
greatly in the resistance which they offer to electricity, and 
so it will not surprise us to learn that while it takes 300 feet 
of iron telegraph wire to give 1 ohm of resistance, it takes 
but 39 feet of number 24 copper wire, and but 2.2 feet of 
number 24 German silver wire, to give the same resistance. 
Note. The number of a wire indicates its diameter; number 30, for 
example, being always of a definite fixed diameter, no matter what the 
material of the wire. 
If we wish to avoid loss of current by heating, we use a 
wire of low resistance; while if we wish to transform elec- 
tricity into heat, as in the electric stove, we choose wire of 
high resistance, as German silver wire.

    CHAPTER XXXV 
HOW ELECTRICITY IS OBTAINED ON A LARGE SCALE 
318. The Dynamo. We have learned that cells furnish 
current as a result of chemical action, and that the substance 
usually consumed within the cell is zinc. Just as coal Ye 
the furnace furnishes heat, so zinc within the cell furnishes 
electricity. But zinc is a much more expensive fuel than 
coal or oil or gas, and to run a large motor by electricity ia 
duced in this way would be very much more expensive than 
to run the motor by water or steam. For weak and infre- 
quent currents such as are used in the electric bell, only small 
quantities of zinc are needed, and the expense is small. But 
for the production of such powerful currents as are needed 
to drive trolley cars, elevators, and huge machinery, enormous 
quantities of zinc would be necessary and the cost would ie 
prohibitive. It is safe to say that electricity would never 
have been used on a large scale if some less expensive and 
more convenient source than zinc had not been found. 
319. A New Source of Electricity. It came to most of us 
as a surprise that an electric current has magnetic properties 
and transforms a coil into a veritable magnet. Perhaps it 
will not surprise us now to learn that a magnet in motion 
has electric properties and is, in fact, able to produce a current 
within a wire. This can be proved as follows :— 
Attach a closely wound coil to a sensitive galvanometer 
(Fig. 237); naturally there is no deflection of the pane 
346 
   
-P-A-G-E-347
A NEW SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY 347 
eter needle, because there is no current in the wire. Now 
thrust a magnet into the coil. Immediately there is a deflec- 
tion of the needle, which indicates that a current is flow- 
ing through the circuit. If the magnet is allowed to remain 
at rest within the coil, the needle returns to its zero posi- 
tion, showing that the current has ceased. Now let the 
  FIG, 237.—The motion of a magnet within a coil of wire produces a current of electricity, 
magnet be withdrawn from the coil; the needle is deflected 
as before, but the deflection is in the opposite direction, 
showing that a current exists, but that it flows in the opposite 
direction. We learn, therefore, that a current may be in- 
duced in a coil by moving a magnet back and forth within 
the coil, but that a magnet at rest within the coil has no such 
influence. 
An electric current transforms a coil into a magnet. A 
magnet in motion induces electricity within a coil; that is, 
causes a current to flow through the coil.
-P-A-G-E-348
  348 HOW ELECTRICITY 1S MADE ON A LARGE as 
A magnet possesses lines of force, and as the ois 
moves toward the coil it carries lines of force with it, and the 
coil is cut, so to speak, by these lines of force. As the mag- 
net recedes from the coil, it carries lines of force away with 
it, this time reducing the number of the lines which cut the 
coil. 
320. A Test of the Preceding Statement. We will test di 
statement that a magnet has electric properties by another ex- 
periment. Between the poles of a strong magnet 
suspend a movable coil which is connected with 
a sensitive galvanometer (Fig. 237). Starting 
with the coil in the position of Figure 228, when 
many lines of force pass through it, let the 
coil be rotated quickly until it reaches the posi- 
tion indicated in Figure 238, when no lines 0 
force pass through it. During the motion of the 
coil, a strong deflection of the galvanometer is 
observed ; but the deflection ceases as soon as the Fic. 238.—As 5 : long as the COil ceases to rotate. If, now, starting with the 
Page ee position of Figure 238, the coil is rotated forward 
poles of the to its starting point, a deflection occurs in the 
reetows.  OPPosite direction, showing that a current is pres- 
ent, but that it flows in the opposite ae 
So long as the coil is in motion, it is cut by a varying 
number of lines of force, and current is induced in the coil. 
The above arrangement is a dynamo in miniature. By 
rotation of a coil (armature) within a magnetic field, that is, 
between the poles of a magnet, current is obtained. 
In the motor, current produces motion. In the dynamo, 
motion produces current. | 
321. The Dynamo. As has been said, the arrangement of 
the preceding Section is a dynamo in miniature. Ever: 
dynamo, no matter how complex its structure and appear- 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
THE DYNAMO 349 
ance, consists of a coil of wire which can rotate continuously 
between the poles of a strong magnet. The mechanical 
devices to insure easy rotation are similar in all respects to 
those previously described for the motor. 
The current obtained from such a dynamo alternates in 
direction, flowing first in one direction and then in the oppo- 
    FIG. 239. — A modern electrical machine. 
site direction. Such alternating currents are unsatisfactory 
for many purposes, and to. be of service are in many cases 
transformed into direct currents; that is, current which flows 
steadily in one direction. This is accomplished by the use of 
acommutator. In the construction of the motor, continuous 
motion in one direction is obtained by the use of a commu- 
tator (Section 310); in the construction of a dynamo, continu- 
ous current in one direction is obtained by the use of a similar 
device.
-P-A-G-E-350
350 HOW ELECTRICITY IS MADE ON A LARGE SCALE 
322. Powerful Dynamos. The power and efficiency of a 
dynamo are increased by employing the devices previously 
mentioned in connection with the motor. Electromagnets   
    
FIG. 240. — Thomas Edison, one of the foremost electrical inventors of the present day. 
are used in place of simple magnets, and the armature, 
instead of being a simple coil, may be made up of many coll ‘ 
wound on soft iron. The speed with which the armature is 
rotated influences the strength of the induced current, and 
hence the armature is run at high speed. 
A small dynamo, such as is used for lighting fifty 
incandescent lamps, has a horse power of about 33.5, and 
large dynamos are frequently as powerful as 7500 horse 
power. | 
323. The Telephone. When a magnet is at rest within a 
closed coil of wire, as in Section 319, current does not flow 
through the wire. But if a piece of iron is brought near the 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
a eee 
  COST OF ELECTRIC POWER 351 
magnet, current is induced and flows through the wire; if the 
iron is withdrawn, current is again induced in the wire but 
flows in the opposite direction. As iron approaches and 
recedes from the magnet, current is induced in the wire 
surrounding the magnet. This is in brief the principle of the 
telephone. When one talks into a receiver, Z, the voice

FIG. 241.— Diagram of a simple telephone circuit. 
throws into vibration a sensitive iron plate standing before an 
electromagnet. The back and forth motion of the iron plate 
induces current in the electromagnet c. The current thus 
induced makes itself evident at the opposite end of the line 
4M, where by its magnetic attraction, it throws a second iron 
plate into vibrations. The vibrations of the second plate 
are similar to those produced in the first plate by the voice. 
The vibrations of the far plate thus reproduce the sounds 
uttered at the opposite end. 
324. Cost of Electric Power. The water power of a stream 
depends upon the quantity of water and the force with which 
it flows. The electric power of a current depends upon the 
quantity of electricity and the force under which it flows. The 
unit of electric power is called the watt; it is the power fur- 
nished by a current of one ampere with a voltage of one volt. 
One watt represents a very small amount of electric power, 
and for practical purposes a unit 1000 times as large is used, 
namely, the kilowatt. By experiment it has been found that 
one kilowatt is equivalent to about 14 horse power. Electric 
current is charged for by the watt hour. A current of one 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
352 HOW ELECTRICITY 1S MADE ON A LARGE SCALE 
ampere, having a voltage of one volt, will furnish ‘in the 
course of one hour one watt hour of energy. Energy for 
electric lighting is sold at the rate of about ten cents per 
kilowatt hour. For other purposes it is less expensive. The 
meters commonly used measure the amperes, volts, and time 
automatically, and register the electric power supplied in 
watt hours.

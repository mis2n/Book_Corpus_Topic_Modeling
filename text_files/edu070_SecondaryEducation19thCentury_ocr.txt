PREFACE 
ee period of which we commonly think when we hear 
or speak of the nineteenth century began in 1789 and 
ended in rgr18. The landmarks of educational history coin- 
cide very conveniently with those of wider history. The 
year 1918 might well be chosen as our terminus by reason 
of the passing of Mr Fisher’s bill even if it had not been 
the year of the Armistice. Even if the years from 1789 to 
1815 had not witnessed the Napoleonic wars, they might 
have been chosen as our starting-place because they saw 
the foundation of the monitorial schools and the re- 
awakening of our ancient universities. These two discon- 
nected sources of educational energy for a long time dis- 
tributed power over distinct areas; it was not till the 
middle of the century that even a “ladder” was suggested 
as a means of ascent from the region served by the one to 
that served by the other; it was not till the Act of 1902 
that elementary and higher education were treated as parts 
of a single whole; and it was not till the Act of 1918 that 
universal education from fourteen to eighteen—the years 
which the children of the wealthy had throughout the 
nineteenth century spent at a public school—was brought 
into sight. 
Here then the work of the preceding century has reached 
a definite landmark. The history of twentieth century edu- 
cation will not naturally fall into two divisions. That of 
the nineteenth century does. In the one story the univer- 
sities are the centre from which activity radiated. In one 
direction it spread to the old public schools and from them 
to the newer public schools and the grammar schools; in 
a second direction it supplied the driving power for adult 
education by means of working men’s colleges, extension 
lectures, and finally tutorial classes; in a third it was con- 
verted into a demand for modern universities and uni- 
versity colleges, which in their turn required new types

of school, the Welsh county schools and the municipal 
secondary schools, to prepare their future students. This is 
the story of which the present volume tries to give an 
outline. The other story starts with the monitorial schools; 
it shows the elementary leaving-age rising ee from ten 
to fourteen, till finally a demand is created for a further 
education of their pupils. In Wales the Intermediate Edu- 
cation Act of 1889, in England the Act of 1902, link the 
two systems of influence together. 
The following pages deal only with England and Wales. 
Though foreign education exercised considerable influence 
in this country, the nineteenth century was far more 
national than the sixteenth. The English Renaissance re- 
presented the effect of a self-conscious civilisation on a 
people which felt the inferiority of its own culture, whereas 
in the nineteenth century Englishmen, in consequence of 
their industrial supremacy, were led to an undue deprecia- 
tion of other nations. English education in Tudor times 
can only be treated as a branch of the tree whose roots 
were in Italy: from whatever quarter the seed of our nine- 
teenth century education was brought, it had a life which 
was all its own. Moreover, the translation of ideas into 
practice followed quite different lines in England and 
abroad. In France and Germany educational systems were 
created by the State; in England institutions grew up 
with a minimum of State intervention. Comparative edu- 
cation is a study of the greatest importance, but it is 
based on the recognition of a difference in educational 
development in different countries rather than on an 
attempt to find a unity between them. 
Though English higher education is most conveniently 
discussed by itself, it is not for a moment suggested that 
educational thought can be based on anything less than 
a study of all forms of education both here and abroad. 
At present we fear that the majority of men are of ne- 
cessity restricted, as regards first-hand knowledge, to some 
one particular type even of secondary or higher education. 
Other types may be known through returns, blue-books, 
and discussions ; but there is something sadly unreal about
-P-A-G-E-7
  PREFACE vii 
such an acquaintance. There is a strong reason for a more 
comprehensive view; it is this. Continental systems are in 
their very nature highly stratified; English policy seeks 
to avoid stratification. But stratification is with us all the 
same; it is a legacy of the past. The more the origin and 
growth of different types of educational institution are 
known to the alumni of other types, the more will this 
isolation tend to disappear. They will soon discover that, 
however segregated were the children of different classes 
in the nineteenth century, influences spread from one class 
to another in the most astonishing manner. The spread 
of games from the public schools to the nation is no isolated 
instance. Underfeeding was as marked at Eton as in 
Mr Squeers’s school; to-day it would be impossible any- 
where. Artisans studied science before Cambridge under- 
graduates knew of it; now Cambridge is in the forefront 
of scientific study. The educational ideals of the twentieth 
century will have their root in those of the nineteenth, 
but the good features which in the nineteenth century 
were peculiar to specific types of institution will in the 
twentieth century tend to become the common property 
of all. The teachers of fifty years hence will not trace back 
their spiritual pedigrees separately to Arnold or to Huxley, 
to F. D. Maurice or to Ruskin; they will be descended 
from them all.

CHAPTER I 
THE DAWN 
, NGLISH education is very old—older than the State, 
older than every national institution save the Church. 
Yet so completely had its antiquity been forgotten that, 
till a few years ago, it was believed to go back only to the 
Renaissance. Mr Leach has changed all this: we now know 
that the supply of grammar schools was greater, in propor- 
tion to the population, in the Middle Ages than at any 
subsequent period up to the Education Act of 1902. The 
past has come to its own again; and there is some danger 
that we may under-rate the work of more recent times. 
Institutions are not like plants which grow from a seed into 
a pre-determined shape: they are transformed into some- 
thing radically different by a creative period, and such a 
period was the nineteenth century. The mediaeval State did 
not spontaneously develop into modern democracy, but was 
reshaped by the ideas of the French Revolution: mediaeval 
religion did not evolve into the beliefs held by the majority 
of Englishmen to-day, as Newman claimed that it developed 
into modern Romanism, merely by making explicit what had 
previously been implicit. Both State and Church have been 
changed by the influence of new ideas; and these new ideas 
have been due to original thinkers, to the influence of other 
nations, and to the effects of changes in one compartment 
of life upon another. So it has been with education. If we 
took away either from present-day educational ideals or 
from their realisation in schools and universities all that 
is due to influences which have become operative since 
1789, how little would be left as an inheritance to the 
twentieth century from the eighteenth! A mere enumeration 
of these modern influences would be a long task. Changes in 
political and religious thought, changes in social life and 
A.S.E, I
-P-A-G-E-16
  2 THE DAWN [cH. 
aspirations; the French Revolution and the Liberal move- 
ment; Evangelicalism, the Oxford movement, and Broad 
Church views; the discoveries of modern science; the 
Industrial Revolution, and the revolution in means of com- 
munication; the fuller understanding of ancient thought, 
the growth of national self-consciousness, and the altered 
outlook on the universe created by modern geology and 
biology; the increasing knowledge of hygienic and psycho- 
logical principles; a fuller consciousness both of the value 
of the individual and of the possibilities of the State:—all 
these influences have been brought to bear on education 
either for the first time or with increased force during the 
last hundred and thirty years. 
There is a peculiar difficulty in studying a recent period 
that these broad influences may elude our grasp. We may 
lose the wood in the trees. Particular events, acts of 
parliament, prominent individuals, may attract our atten- 
tion too much. The very nearness of the period makes the 
‘details stand out too closely; we may fail to appreciate the 
general structure of the building. But it is only by recog- 
nising the broad influences that we are able to interpret 
as well as to know past events, and it is only by inter- 
pretation that we can use the past as a guide to the future. 
This danger of laying over-much stress on events which 
can be named and dated is particularly insidious in the 
present case because it tends to put State action in the 
forefront of the changes which have taken place in educa- 
tion during the last century. State action is now peculiarly 
in favour; and large numbers of persons are brought into 
contact with education as holders of administrative posts 
or as members of administrative committees. They are 
therefore inclined to look at education as a machine built 
by the State and driven by the bodies controlling local 
government. The history of education, provided it be truly 
the history of education and not the history of educational 
legislation, should help to rectify any such one-sided view. 
It should reveal the vitalising forces which were the true 
source of educational energy; it should endeavour to 
establish the extent to which education has been affected 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  ] THE DAWN 3 
by the work of individual men and women; it should show 
by what forces legislators and administrators have been 
driven. 
A oenily of English higher education in the nineteenth 
century involves then keeping the balance even between 
three kinds of topic; intellectual and social movements 
which have affected education, the work of individual 
endeavour, and the action of the State,) Three of the 
chapters which follow take great movéments as their 
starting-point. Two! of them are concerned with the in- 
tellectual movements which affected the two great divisions 
of study, the humanities and the natural sciences; one? 
deals with movements which are more of a social character. 
The humanistic movement in education which revived the 
older universities and schools was a meeting-point of the 
new political, religious, and aesthetic enthusiasms of the 
early part of the century; the scientific movement in 
education which created new subjects of study and new 
institutions to teach them was the outcome of the great 
advances in science itself. The social movements produce 
their effect later, and we have grouped them round the 
well-known names of Matthew Arnold, Ruskin, Maurice, 
and Kingsley. In the early part of the period these move- 
ments were brought to bear on education almost entirely 
by the creative genius of individuals; and four chapters 
are devoted mainly, but not entirely, to their work. In 
each case one or two individuals have been peculiarly 
originators, though many persons have taken a share in 
the building. These chapters deal with the revival of the 
public schools in the thirties and forties, the creation of 
new types, the work of individual endeavour in boys’ 
schools after the middle of the century, and the reform of 
girls’ and women’s education. Finally the part played by 
the State is examined in two chapters‘, of which one deals 
with the reform of old institutions as a result of the Royal 
Commissions which sat during the fifties and sixties, and 
the other with the great extension of educational facilities

by more recent legislation: and another chapter!, on 
popular and technical education, is largely of the same 
character®. 
It may be well to indicate at the beginning the part 
which the reader will probably judge at the end that each 
of these three factors has played. The State cannot create 
ideas, and rarely has it been the first agency to realise 
them in concrete institutions. Its main function has been 
to multiply copies of the successful experiments which have 
been made by individuals. Though a State official who 
was also a creative genius in educational matters is con- 
ceivable, no example can be produced from English history 
during the nineteenth century’. The creative work of 
devising new types of educational institution, new curri- 
cula, and new methods of teaching and government has 
been mainly the work of individuals, such as Birkbeck the 
founder of Mechanics’ Institutes, Maurice the author of 
the Working Men’s College, Hogg the originator of poly- 
technics, Thomas Arnold who discovered how the elder 
boys could transmit the headmaster’s influence to the 
younger, Thring who discovered how the aesthetic and 
practical subjects could be made a vehicle of education, 
or Miss Beale the creator of the first public school for girls*. 
State-created institutions have been either copies or 
failures®. But the individuals who built up the institutions 
have been largely inspired by ideas which originated out- 
side the scholastic circle; hence such men as Ruskin or 
ech. xX: 
2 The chapters on Welsh education (x1) and on changes in curri- 
culum and method do not fall under any of the three headings. 
3 Matthew Arnold seems to “prove the rule.’’ He was an educa- 
tional official and he was a great force in changing educational ideals: 
but he exercised his main influence not through what he did as an 
inspector, but by his leisure occupation as a literary critic! 4 
4 If the volume took in elementary education, we should add the 
names of Robert Owen, Dr Barnardo and Baden-Powell (Froebel 
and Montessori being foreigners). 
5 Had it not been for “schools of science” the last two words 
could be omitted, as there is nothing distinctive in any other State- 
created institution.
-P-A-G-E-19
  1] THE DAWN 5 
Huxley claim as large a part in the history of education 
as the great teachers or founders of schools and colleges. 
Probably the nearest approach which the State has 
made to originality in the sphere of education is to be 
found in the activities of the various Royal Commissions. 
Not even the most pronounced individualist would deny 
the capacity of the State to choose a number of the most 
thoughtful men in the country, to induce them for a limited 
time to devote their concentrated attention to a particular 
topic, and to give them facilities for collecting all available 
evidence and for coming into contact with all opinions 
worth having. It is probable too that these bodies of 
enquirers reached conclusions in their corporate capacity 
which no single member would have attained for himself. 
But it must be remembered that such conclusions only 
crystallised the thought of half-a-century on the problems 
concerned; and that their effect was produced quite as 
much by their influence on public opinion and through 
the subsequent action of individuals as through the legis- 
lative and administrative changes to which they gave rise. 
* * * * * * * 
' A comprehensive glance at the state of British uni- 
vefsities and secondary schools between 1789 and 1815 
reveals one outstanding feature. They do not reflect any 
ideals of their own age. \No new driving power had come 
to them for a century-dnd-a half. To understand them we 
have to go back to the Renaissance,_As early as the first 
half of the-seventéenth century there had come a loss of 
faith in the educational ideals of classical humanism; by 
the second half of that century intellectual and moral 
enthusiasm was exhausted; and low-water mark was 
reached in the middle of the eighteenth century. After 
that point moral energy was gathering power, but it was 
still unable to cope with the tremendous force of inertia. 
Existing higher education, then, at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century represented tradition. It was there 
because it had been there for two centuries and no one had 
arisen to alter it.  
-P-A-G-E-20

6 THE DAWN [cu. 
We will consider the state of the universities first. In 
the days of Queen Elizabeth they seemed about to enter 
on a period of new vigour. These hopes were not destined 
to be fulfilled. Many explanations have been given. Con- 
troversialists! in the first half of the nineteenth century 
found the reason in the changes which took place in their 
constitution, by which the powers hitherto exercised by 
the whole body of resident masters of arts were transferred 
to a council of heads of colleges.. Others, anxious to point 
a moral to modern times, have explained it as due to State 
intervention. The dissipation of energy in religious con- 
troversies has been put forward with a greater show of 
probability as the reason. None of these explanations 
appears to go to the root of the matter. A system of 
studies which possessed an inherent vitality should have 
been able to offer a more vigorous resistance to external 
circumstances. A fervid belief in the worth of classical 
pursuits would not have allowed itself to be overwhelmed 
by religious quarrels. We are more likely therefore to find 
the true explanation of the stagnation which crept over 
the English universities in some lack of stimulating power 
in the new curriculum. Two features give us the clue. The 
first is the exclusiveness of humanism. Its literary ideal 
appealed only to the few. In spite of its claims to be a 
guide of life, it never touched the hearts of Englishmen. 
It did not, like the older Scholasticism, offer a rational 
explanation of the universe which would support their 
religion. Content was entirely subordinate to form. There 
was no study of ancient history. Classical scholarship 
advanced, but it was left to the Germans of the late 
eighteenth century to discover the true significance of 
Greek literature. The second feature is the character of 
post-Renaissance philosophy. The universities, when they 
abandoned Scholasticism, did not, as a thorough-going 
humanism might have done, abandon philosophy. Nor 
did they even give up Aristotle: for it was a canon of 
Renaissance teaching that all knowledge worth acquiring 
1 E.g. Sir William Hamilton whose articles are collected in his 
Discussions, 1852.
-P-A-G-E-21
  1] THE DAWN R 
was contained in the ancient writers. They merely sub- 
stituted the genuine Aristotle for scholastic Aristotelianism. 
The recognition of a single writer as the infallible standard 
of philosophic, and for a time even of scientific, truth 
substituted a more rigid authority for that measure of 
originality which, within fixed limits, stimulated the 
student of scholastic philosophy. The Middle Ages trained 
the undergraduate in original speculation, though they 
forbade him to use the power which they had given him; 
the Renaissance Aristotle dulled his mind by bidding him 
blindly accept the written text. A revival could only come 
with a new inspiration. 
The loss of intellectual interests made the way easy for 
a lowering of the moral tone. The “poor scholar” had 
nothing to attract him to the university. His place was 
taken by the sons of the aristocracy whose interest in 
study was small. In the Middle Ages the nobility had been 
the exception, middle class students abounded, and the 
children of the labourer were not unknown. In the course 
of the eighteenth century, the poor boy came to be regarded 
as a tolerated addition: he was often a “‘servitor,’”’ and was 
bitterly conscious of being among his social superiors. The 
land-owning class were regarded as the natural denizens. 
They entered the university, not to feed on solidintellectual 
food, but to enjoy a costly luxury. While they were there, 
they naturally did what other young men of their class 
were doing elsewhere. So far from being formed by the 
ethos of the university, they brought it its ethos. It was 
merely the atmosphere of the London coffee-house trans- 
ferred to Oxford or Cambridge. Extravagance, debt, 
drunkenness, gambling, and an absurd attention to dress 
became the special forms of irregularity favoured by the 
gentlemen commoners, whose ranks were swollen by the 
nouveaux riches at the end of the century. Even fellows 
of colleges spent much of their time in the tavern. 
Work ceased at dinner time, which meant eleven o’clock 
at the beginning of the century, and two or three hours 
later at the end. By the middle of the century the in- 
terest in his pupils which the better type of tutor still

displayed in the days of Whitefield and Johnson had 
vanished. 
The intellectual decadence was greater at Oxford than 
at Cambridge. Vicesimus Knox’s account of the tests for 
the Oxford degree is well-known!. In form they were a 
combination of the mediaeval disputation and an oral 
examination. There were three stages: the first con- 
stituted the candidates “‘sophs,” the second conferred the 
bachelor’s degree, and the third the master’s. For the 
sophomore test two candidates were paired off as ‘‘ oppo- 
nent” and “respondent” in a disputation. The arguments, 
Knox tells us, “consisted of foolish syllogisms on foolish 
subjects” of which the candidate knew nothing, ‘handed 
down from generation to generation on long slips of paper.” 
Armed with these the two disputants betook themselves 
to a “large dusty room” where ‘‘not once in a hundred 
times does any officer enter; and, if he does, he hears one 
syllogism or two and then makes a bow and departs.”’ For 
the rest of the time the candidates read a novel or carved 
their names on the desks. Passing was a matter of course. 
The bachelor’s degree involved a viva voce examination; 
but this was conducted by three masters of arts of the 
candidate’s own choice, and it was “considered good 
management to get acquainted with two or three jolly 
young masters of arts and to supply them with port previous 
to the examination.”’ It was indeed usual to obtain little 
cram-books containing “forty or fifty” traditional ques- 
tions on each subject and to spend three or four days in 
memorising them, and there was a perfunctory construe of 
a passage from a classical author; but the turning of familiar 
English phrases into Latin which ended the proceedings 
seems merely to have fulfilled the réle of the satyric play 
which followed an Athenian trilogy. ‘I have known,” 
says Knox, ‘‘the questions to consist of an enquiry into 
the pedigree of a race-horse.’’ The test for the master’s 
degree involved both a disputation and an examination, 
which were no better than those at the earlier stages, as 
well as a “declamation.’”’ Originally the M.A. degree had 
1 Essays, Moral and Literary, vol. 1, Essay 77.
-P-A-G-E-23
  1] THE DAWN 9 
been at the same time a license and an obligation to teach 
within the university, and the declamation was the proof 
of the candidate’s ability to lecture. In Knox’s day, how- 
ever, “it was always called a wall lecture, because the 
lecturer had no other audience than the walls,” though he 
“gets a sheet or two of Latin from some old book”’ to read 
should the proctor come in. Knox is clearly no favourable 
critic, but he is supported by the evidence of men of such 
different standpoints as Gibbon, Adam Smith, Malmesbury, 
and Eldon, while no effective defence has ever been put 
forward. If we wish to picture Oxford in the year when 
George III ascended the throne, we must imagine a 
university in which professors had ceased to lecture, where 
tutors regarded an enquiring student as a nuisance, and 
where work was the last thing expected. 
Cambridge never sank quite so low as Oxford, and the 
revival came earlier. The causes of decay were the same; 
but Cambridge received a stimulus from the genius of 
Newton which Oxford lacked. It may be observed in 
passing that the call of Bacon, the herald of experimental 
science, did not seriously affect either university; for the 
non-mathematical sciences had no point of contact with 
the old curriculum, nor did they satisfy the demand for 
logical certainty, to which four centuries of training in 
dialectic had habituated the academic mind. But mathe- 
matics was part of the old quadrivium, and its development 
and application supplied just that stimulus which was 
suited to the time. It proceeded on strict syllogistic lines, 
yet it was progressive and yielded new truths; further, it 
gave a comprehensive explanation of the material order 
of the universe through astronomy, which men had in 
different directions been long seeking. Unfortunately 
Newton lived in a slack age and three-quarters of a century 
was needed to reveal the full force of the new driving 
power. But by the second half of the eighteenth century 
mathematics was established as the dominant study in 
Cambridge. This necessitated the substitution of a new 
type of exercise for the old disputation and between 1766 
and 1833 the modern type of written examination was
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 THE DAWN (cH. 
gradually evolved. In r800 Oxford adopted the same kind 
of test, and the revival of the university was believed to 
date from that event. Later, the written examination, 
which originated simply as the easiest means of testing 
the power of solving mathematical problems, was every- 
where adopted as an educational panacea. 
Since the system was long regarded, not merely as a sign 
of returning life, but as its cause, it is desirable to trace its 
growth a little more fully. Dr Jebb of Trinity describes it 
as it existed in 1772'. Disputation and examination were 
still combined, and the latter was mainly oral. The dis- 
putations were begun in the second term of the candidate’s 
last year, when the “moderators,” as the examiners were 
called, conducted them on five afternoons a week. The 
candidates received a fortnight’s notice. One acted as 
“respondent” and three as ‘‘opponents.’’ The respondent 
submitted in advance three propositions which he was 
prepared to maintain, and read a short Latin thesis on one 
of them. He then disputed with his three opponents in 
turn, the discussion commencing in strict syllogistic form, 
but “sliding into free and unconfined debate” as it pro- 
ceeded. Marks were recorded, on the strength of which 
the candidates were divided into groups for the examina- 
tion. This was conducted in English. All candidates were 
questioned orally on the first six books of Euclid, elementary 
algebra, trigonometry, mechanics, hydrostatics, astronomy, 
and optics; and “a very superficial knowledge in morality 
and metaphysics” was expected, involving a few questions 
on Locke, Butler, or Clarke. The colleges took a share in 
the examination, each appointing one of its tutors as 
“father.’’ The university moderators and the college 
fathers met at breakfast and dinner to discuss the merits 
of the candidates, the best of whom were eventually 
divided into three classes. The best twenty-eight usually 
formed the first two classes, Wranglers and Senior Optimes, 
and the next twelve the Junior Optimes. The system was 
obviously not the farce which Knox describes at Oxford;

-P-A-G-E-25
  1] THE DAWN Ir 
but it must be borne in mind how small a part of the 
university was included in the list of forty candidates 
who were awarded honours and how small was the greund 
covered in two years almost exclusively devoted to mathe- 
matical study. Moreover Jebb goes on to tell us that “so 
alarming is the apprehension” of this half-year “that the 
student frequently seeks to avoid the difficulty or disgrace 
by commencing fellow-commoner ” ; for in those days social 
position and higher fees were officially recagnised as en- 
titling to easier examinations! 
Changes were inevitable. Owing to the difficulty of 
combining the marks for the disputations with those for 
the examination, it was soon found that the candidate’s 
place in the class-list was in fact determined almost solely 
by the examination; and the importance of problems in 
mathematical work emphasised the written part of the 
examination. It was not, however, till 1838 that the 
division of candidates into groups on the strength of the 
disputations and the setting of different questions to these 
groups were finally abandoned; and the disputations and 
the viva voce examination maintained a moribund existence 
for a little longer. 
The revival at Oxford began during the last thirty years 
of the eighteenth century. An energetic type of college 
tutor once more arose!, and Gibbon? assures us that learning 
had once more ‘‘become a fashion.’”” To encourage work 
among the undergraduates, three heads of colleges, Cyril 
Jackson, dean of Christ Church (1783-1809), John Parsons, 
master of Balliol (1798-1813), and John Eveleigh, provost 
of Oriel (1781-1814), carried the ‘‘new examination statute,” 
which introduced a genuine examination for all candi- 
dates and the award of honours to the most successful, as 
at Cambridge. Conservative opposition was allayed by 
making the change at first purely optional; but the success 
of the new system was in a few years so obvious that it 
was made compulsory without a struggle, and there was

  12 THE DAWN [cu. 
a tremendous rush of candidates to take their degrees 
before the old system finally disappeared. At Oxford 
classics naturally held the premier place in the examination, 
with mathematics as second. The viva voce examination, 
being more suited to classics than to mathematics, was for 
a long time of great importance and it has never entirely 
vanished. A few more years saw the introduction of three 
classes, as at Cambridge, the separation of classical and 
mathematical, honours, and the institution of separate 
examinations for pass candidates. Up to our own day the 
view has generally prevailed that the revival of serious 
study is to be mainly attributed to the new statute: yet, 
great though its influence undoubtedly was, it would have 
been powerless but for the more serious attitude to life 
which, under the influence of the religious revival and the 
struggle with Napoleon, was spreading among the whole 
of English society. It is doubtful too whether the revival 
of classical studies would have been permanent had they 
not been found to have, in their political and philosophical 
bearings, a close relation to modern life which has quite 
transformed the studies of the school of Litterae humaniores. 
The rise of this newer humanism will form the topic of the 
next chapter. 
The revival of intellectual life in the universities was 
followed by a revival in some of the larger public schools 
which gradually spread. The history of these few schools 
is therefore for the moment the main thread of the history 
of secondary education. 
The eighteenth century is an obscure period in the 
history of English schools; but, by comparing their con- 
dition at its close with their condition in the middle of the 
seventeenth century, we can see that many changes had 
taken place. Nevertheless, as in the case of the universities, 
the basis of education in the schools was still the curriculum 
of the Renaissance. 
Half of the mediaeval grammar schools perished in the 
troublous times of the Reformation, but through the 
generosity of founders the loss was made good in the reign

of Queen Elizabeth. With a few exceptions, such as 
Shrewsbury, these schools, though numerous, were quite 
small, and the staff regularly consisted of two only, the 
schoolmaster who took the upper half of the school, and 
the usher who took the lower. All were day schools except 
Eton and Winchester: the boys from the country districts 
lodged in the town. The distinction between the great 
public schools and the smaller grammar schools had not 
yet arisen. 
Their decline probably set in with the Restoration. Locke 
takes, it for granted that to send a boy to school is ‘‘to 
sacrifice his innocency to the attaining of confidence and 
some little drill of bustling for himself among others, by 
his conversation with ill-bred and vicious boys,” and 
declares it to be wholly impossible for a master to supervise 
“three or four score boys lodged up and down!.” As time 
went on, matters grew worse. The bulk of the grammar 
schools decayed; some disappeared altogether. Governing 
bodies became lethargic; in some cases they even mis- 
appropriated the funds which they were appointed to 
guard; parents no longer showed the old zeal for educa- 
tion; the universities were no goal to which boys eagerly 
pressed, nor did they send forth a supply of capable 
teachers. 
By the time when we next have much information on 
English secondary schools, at the close of the eighteenth 
century, the distinction between the “ public schools” and 
the rest of the grammar schools is well established. The 
public schools were merely those of the grammar schools 
which had increased in numbers and prestige while the 
rest declined. Two changes had occurred which served to 
differentiate them ; they had increased the numbers of their 
staff, and they had become boarding-schools. The first of 
these changes cannot be traced clearly, as it is not usually 
recorded in the minutes of governing bodies. It seems to 
have been regarded as a private arrangement of the head- 
master for the performance of the work for which he alone 
was responsible to the governors ; hence the existing custom

in these schools by which the appointment and dismissal 
of assistant masters rest with the headmaster alone. The 
boarding system at first took the form of houses kept by 
“dominies” and ‘‘dames,’’ who were not members of the 
teaching staff; headmasters began to keep houses before 
their assistants were encouraged to do so. The new system 
may well have arisen from a desire to escape from the 
laxity described by Locke; but it would be facilitated by 
the coming of the stage coach and improvements in the 
roads: If it was intended to improve the tone of schools, it 
was a terrible failure. It exaggerated the evils, though it 
concealed them. Unruly conduct could no longer occur in 
the streets where it could be seen; but the herding together 
of forty or fifty boys with a low moral tone in barracks 
without proper supervision made it impossible for any to 
escape the bad influence. The resulting evils will be con- 
sidered when we come to the attempts of the great re- 
forming headmasters to combat them. 
The Public Schools Commission in the middle of the 
nineteenth century recognised nine public schools—Eton, 
’ Winchester, Westminster, Shrewsbury, Harrow, Charter- 
house, Rugby, St Paul’s, and Merchant Taylors’. The last 
two were still day-schools, and the number is in conse-’ 
quence usually taken as seven. Of the nine, four were in 
London and three comparatively near. Before describing 
their common features it may be well to explain briefly 
how each of them attained its position. 
Eton and Winchester, unlike the others, were boarding- 
schools from their foundation. William of Wykeham, in 
founding Winchester and New College, Oxford, intended 
them to be a new departure, a school and a college on 
a larger scale than any which were then in existence. 
Henry VI, the royal founder of Eton and King’s College, 
Cambridge, followed William’s lines. In both cases, though 
the free scholars were the true foundation, a limited number 
of the sons of the aristocracy were from the first to be 
admitted as paying boarders: for both founders wished to 
encourage the novel desire for book-learning among the 
baronial and knightly class. In both cases these boys came
-P-A-G-E-29
1] THE DAWN 15 
to outnumber the foundation scholars, and the later 
character of the schools was thus established. 
Eton, situated close to the royal residence of Windsor, 
and zealously patronised by monarchs like Elizabeth, 
gradually rose almost to the position of a national institu- 
- tion. Such it must have been when Gray wrote his Ode, 
though its Toryism rendered it, like Oxford, suspect to 
the Hanoverian kings and their Whig ministers. Towards 
the end of the eighteenth century it was exercising a direct 
influence over other schools. James (1778-1794) developed 
Rugby on Etonian lines, and Butler (1798-1836) trans- 
planted many Etonian institutions from Rugby to Shrews- 
bury. James’s account of Eton, written in 1766, and 
rendered accessible in Maxwell Lyte’s History of Eton 
College, is almost the only living document which gives us 
a real insight into the school life of the eighteenth century. 
Winchester originally not only took its foundationers 
and ten commensales (young aristocrats), but also day- 
boys. Leach believes that the day-boys disappeared with 
the foundation of a rival school by a seceding usher in 
1630. The patronage of Charles II emphasised the aristo- 
cratic side; new buildings were erected in 1689; and, after 
a temporary decline due to its high Toryism, it revived 
under Burton (1724-1766), under whom its numbers 
reached 204 and its aristocratic character became more 
pronounced. Dames’ houses never existed at Winchester, 
and the numbers had to be restricted through lack of room 
in the school itself. From 1775 to 1793 it passed through 
troublous times and furnishes several instances of the 
school rebellions which marked that period. The rule of 
Goddard (1796-1809) revived it, and his experiments in 
self-government formed the model on which his more 
famous pupil Thomas Arnold built his system at Rugby. 
Westminster in its original intention approximated more 
nearly to Eton and Winchester than did any of the others. 
It was refounded in 1560 for forty foundationers who were 
boarders and for the day-boys of the city, as well as for 
a few “pensioners” (commensales). The Latin play which 
it still preserves was a common feature of Elizabethan

schools. Its floruit was in the middle of the seventeenth 
century under its famous headmaster Busby (1640-1695) 
Dames’ houses after the Eton model appear early in the 
eighteenth century. But it declined to a hundred pupils 
at the close of the century and did not revive till the 
appointment of Liddell in 1848. 
Shrewsbury was the great school of Elizabeth’s reign 
and of the early seventeenth century, when it contained 
no less than four hundred pupils. But from the middle of 
that century it declined, and was only restored by a change 
in its constitution which was effected by an act of parlia- 
ment in 1798. The appointment of Samuel Butler (1798- 
1836) to the headmastership made it for a time a model 
which other schools followed in the matter of classical 
teaching, and old Salopians introduced Butler’s methods 
even into Eton. 
Harrow, opened in 1615, was intended by its founder 
purely as a local grammar school for the “‘ poor boys”’ of 
the parish, and entered on its career in humble fashion 
with only thirty boys. But House (1669-1685), an 
Etonian, set to work to remodel it on Eton lines; dames’ 
houses appear; the proximity to London placed it in an 
advantageous position ; and finally it received the patronage 
of the Whig nobility who distrusted the Toryism of Eton 
and Winchester. After a short period of eclipse its position 
was consolidated by Thackeray (appointed 1746), and the 
famous classical scholar Dr Parr was one of its ushers. 
A second period of decline, which set in about 1805, 
removes it from importance during the great reforming 
epoch, and it only recovered with the headmastership of 
Vaughan (1844), who introduced the ideas of Thomas 
Arnold. 
Charterhouse (1611) was intended for foundationers only. 
The almshouse attached was no peculiar feature, though 
it has been rendered more familiar than its fellows by the 
genius of Thackeray. 
Rugby (1567) was the last of the seven to win its position. 
Its founder, Laurence Sheriff, left its endowment in the 
form of land just outside London. In course of time the
-P-A-G-E-31

houses extended over these lands, which were let on long 
leases. These leases began to fall in during the latter half 
of the eighteenth century, and the school suddenly found 
itself wealthy. James (1778-1799), its Etonian headmaster, 
seized the opportunity, and raised the numbers from 52 
to 245. It was James and not Arnold who made Rugby 
large and famous; to Arnold was left the greater task of 
catching the popular imagination by a picture of an 
idealised Rugby which was the pattern for three generations 
of great headmasters in other schools: 
It may be gathered that there was much mutual in- 
fluence between these schools. Eton was the model for 
James’s Rugby, this in its turn for Butler’s Shrewsbury, 
and Shrewsbury repaid its debt to Eton by the influence 
of Butler’s pupils. Goddard’s Winchester inspired Arnold, 
and Arnold’s Rugby had an even closer influence on 
Harrow, which at an earlier time had been influenced by 
Eton. But the influence of these schools was soon not to 
be confined to their own circle. From 1840 onwards new 
schools sprang up on the same lines; the Arnold tradition 
shaped Cheltenham, Marlborough, Haileybury and many 
others; and the torch was subsequently handed on till it 
reached all the schools which were given new life by the 
Endowed Schools Act. It is this which renders the reform 
of the public schools so important. The smaller grammar 
schools, important as they had been in the past, had 
decayed, and their new vigour came to them from the 
public schools half a century later. History is concerned 
with the germs from which proceeded future growth, not 
with the vestiges of decay. For this reason we are not 
here concerned with the history of the Nonconformist 
Academies, which probably gave the best education that 
was known in the eighteenth century: for they underwent 
a sudden eclipse and hardly lasted into the new century. 
The history of the public schools during the thirty years 
which preceded Queen Victoria’s accession enables us to 
trace the origins of our present secondary school tradition. 
The gross evils of this period determined the lines on which 
the great headmasters of the next generation had to

proceed in their reforming efforts. The genius of the 
reformers lay in diagnosing the causes of evil and turning 
many of them into means of good—indeed into instruments 
for destroying others which were irredeemably bad. We 
will begin with the intellectual side and glance at the 
curriculum of Eton as described by James?, which, with 
a little alteration, formed the curriculum of Rugby under 
James and of Shrewsbury under Butler. 
The work of the sixth and fifth forms, which were taken 
together by the headmaster, gives the best indication of 
the standard which a classical school of those days aimed 
at. There were ten construing lessons in a full week: 
Homer’s Iliad, 35 lines, two; Lucian, 40 lines, two; Vergil’s 
Aeneid, 30 lines, two; Scriptores Romani, 40 lines, two; 
Poetae Graeci, 35 lines, one; Horace (hexameters), 60 lines, 
one; and seven repetition lessons, viz. in the pieces trans- 
lated from Homer, Vergil, Horace, and the Greek poets, 
and in the Greek Testament (one) and a book of Latin 
selections (two). Horace’s Odes and Greek plays were 
substituted for some of the other books during a part of 
the year. Three compositions were written each week, an 
original Latin theme, a set of Latin elegiacs, and for the 
sixth a set of Greek iambics or for the fifth of Latin lyrics. 
Declamations and speeches came at the end of term. This 
syllabus remained substantially unchanged throughout the 
long headmastership of Dr Keate (1809-1834) ; for except 
that a selection of Scriptores Graeci had been added to 
Lucian, who was till then the only Greek prose-writer read, 
and that the hours seem to be slightly fewer, it is the 
syllabus attacked by the Edinburgh Review? in 1830. 
James’s scheme? contains all the Eton writers along with 
Cicero, Demosthenes, and Juvenal; the Homer and Vergil 
are read in selections; and there is one hour’s history (bibli- 
cal, classical, and English in turn), and one hour either of 
Milton or of mathematics. The compositions are the same, 
but only a few boys took iambics, which were so recent an

innovation that Walter Savage Landor was under the 
belief that he was in the first batch of boys in any school 
to do them!. Even after Butler had been more than twenty 
years at Shrewsbury, Tacitus was the only addition®. 
As regards the work of the lower forms at Eton, the 
first did nothing but Latin grammar; the second the Latin 
Testament, and catechism, and Phaedrus; the next form 
began Greek and read Latin selections; the fourth took 
Ovid, Aesop, Caesar, Terence, Latin selections, and Greek 
Testament; the Remove did Vergil, Horace’s Odes, Pom- 
ponius Mela, Cornelius Nepos, and the Poetae Graeci, The 
younger boys did some writing and arithmetic, and some 
of the fifth took geography and algebra as extras. 
The Edinburgh Review in 1830 mercilessly analysed the 
old classical scheme of studies. It was essentially linguistic 
and stylistic. It did not reveal ancient life or thought. 
Scarcely an author was read consecutively. The authors 
were illuminated byno systematic course in ancient history. 
The choice of prose-writers was bad; Lucian was exalted 
and Thucydides neglected. “It is doubtful if any boy 
knows what the Persian and Peloponnesian wars were.’’ 
The Poetae Graeci were not arranged in chronological 
order; the biographical notes were not enough to put the 
authors in their proper setting. In short “attention is 
distracted from the really important lessons of history and 
philosophy to grammatical and metrical trifling.’ But, 
setting aside this cardinal defect, even if the stylistic aim 
were to be accepted, was the study of selections written 
in all dialects the way to secure a good Attic (or any other) 
style? What defence could be made for the text-books? 
The notes in the editions were suitable neither for beginners 
nor for more advanced pupils. What purpose was served 
by the Latin translation of the Greek authors? Why were 
the grammars written in Latin? Even their contents were 
bad; yet they were used in other schools owing to the 
prestige of Eton. They had not kept pace with the “recent

much that is useless and much that is inaccurate, they 
exclude much that is useful”; they are badly arranged; 
in the Greek grammar “needless rules and technical 
divisions are multiplied without mercy,” till there were 
ten declensions and thirteen conjugations!. The composi- 
tions were noticeable for the “‘triteness of the subjects 
proposed for the Latin themes and the inattention to the 
mode of treating them.” Had the reviewer condescended 
to discuss the teaching of the lowest form as well as that 
of the upper school, he might have found a still stronger 
ground of criticism in the devotion of a whole year’s work 
to the memorising of accidence before the beginner was 
allowed to apply his grammar to the simplest Latin sen- 
tence. The absence of all non-classical subjects save as 
despised ‘‘extras”’ was too obvious a point of attack to be 
missed. Only one possible merit is allowed—the composi- 
tions stand out above the rest of the work. The Latin prose 
is very fair, and the verses may even be good. 
Can we endorse this sweeping condemnation? Three 
questions are involved, (x) the almost entire confinement 
of studies to classics, (2) the purely stylistic aim in teaching 
classics, and (3) the effectiveness of the teaching in attaining 
the stylistic aim. 
Two lines of defence are conceivable under the first 
heading. The first is that the schools were bound to confine 
their teaching to classics by their foundation statutes. 
One of the local grammar schools, Leeds, made a mild 
attempt to substitute modern studies and in consequence 
in 1805 found itself entangled in a law-suit, in which 
Lord Chancellor Eldon decided that, however desirable 
the change might be to the community and however much 
it might be wished by the great majority of parents, it was 
not the founder’s intention and was therefore illegal. To 
this plea it may be answered that, before the Public Schools 
Act provided for the revision of founder’s statutes, a 
modicum of mathematics, French, modern history and 
geography found their way into the regular curriculum 
of several of the public schools and that no one brought an

action against them. The second plea is more forcible. No 
methods had been found of teaching most of the newer 
subjects save as mere memory work. As taught in the 
bulk of private schools and girls’ schools, they were value- 
less. Making out the meaning of an author or writing a 
Latin prose at least involved real mental activity on the 
part of the pupils: memorising dates and lists of capes did 
not. But, valid as this argument is against most of the 
“modern” subjects, it fails against mathematics, which 
already fulfilled all the requirements of a good school 
subject. Cambridge sent out a plentiful supply of graduates 
who could have taught the subject as well as classics was 
taught. The pupils had an opportunity for using the 
mathematics which they learned at school in their subse- 
quent university course. In view of these facts we can only 
conclude that the schools merely succumbed to the weight 
of inertia; and the generation which failed to stimulate 
them must itself share the blame. 
The case is somewhat different with the second charge. 
The historical, political, and philosophical value of the 
ancient writers had to be discovered before it could be 
utilised in teaching. Up to 1800 the best exponents of 
classics were still cast in the scholarly mould of Bentley 
and Porson. The literary criticism of Wolf, the artistic 
criticism of Lessing, the insight of Goethe, the historical 
criticism of Niebuhr, had to wake echoes in the English 
universities before they could produce an effect on the 
teaching in English schools. The Reviewers were right in 
raising the question in 1830. A few years earlier there 
would have been no one capable even of understanding 
the issue. And almost immediately afterwards we find 
Arnold adopting these very lines. But the slowness with 
which he found imitators is a justification of the Edin- 
burgh attack. 
Finally, narrow as was the aim which the schools set 
before them, can we say that they were successful in 
accomplishing it? It is here that modern opinion is apt 
to be a trifle unfair. We may grant all the defects charged 
against it; the methods at the early stages were of the

crudest, and even at the upper stages Butler had almost 
everything to teach his contemporary headmasters; still, 
far more was accomplished than we should have anticipated. 
The public schools were doing better work than the uni- 
versities. The freshman of those days went up knowing his 
Vergil and Horace by heart; he could write a fairly polished 
Latin prose; and, if we admit that even a good versifier 
is ‘‘born, not made,” the number is somewhat surprising. 
We should probably be wrong if we denied the schools a 
claim to have made the governing classes of those days 
more civilised by these means. Pitt’s House of Commons 
would have been out of its depth if any speaker had 
presupposed an understanding of the political or ethical 
philosophy of Plato or Aristotle, but it was readily moved 
by humanitarian appeals; and it does not seem unreason- 
able to attribute its broad human sympathy, its love of 
stately oratory which appealed to the nobler elements in our 
nature, and its dawning consciousness of a national mission 
for the promotion of liberty, in part at least toits familiarity 
with a great literature. Canning, Peel, and Gladstone, no 
less than Chatham, Burke, and Pitt, were products of the 
old classical course. 
We have dealt somewhat at length with the purely 
intellectual side of public school education because it is 
the hardest side for us who live in the twentieth century 
to appreciate, not because it is the most important. The 
other sides can be passed over more quickly at this stage, 
as it will be necessary to revert to them again in describing 
how they were remedied. 
1. The boarding arrangements, in so far as they were 
in the hands of the school, as for instance in the case of the 
“collegers” or foundation scholars at Eton, were bad. The 
food was insufficient and had to be supplemented privately!. 
There were no private studies, so that opportunity for work 
was practically confined to the preparation hours®. The

English reading was done with tutors.

dormitories were badly furnished and damp; it is even said 
that the snow could drift into ‘Long Chamber!.” The 
household work was left to the “‘fags?.’”’ There was no 
place to wash save at the pump. Matters were better in 
the dames’ houses; Gibbon’s account of these is quite 
favourable*. The change whereby boarding-houses tended 
to come into the hands of assistant masters may not there- 
fore always have been a change for the better. 
2. Discipline, judged by modern standards, was in- 
tolerable. Assistant masters were not expected to take 
any part in its maintenance out of school hours; and in 
school they relied on the terror inspired by the head‘. 
Constant floggings could maintain some semblance of 
obedience for a time; then the suppressed discontent would 
break out in open mutiny. In two cases, at Winchester 
and at Rugby, these rebellions reached such dimensions 
that the military had to be called in. No semblance of 
confidence existed between masters and boys. Keate ex- 
pected that all boys would lie to him, and took no pains 
to conceal his belief from them. The elder boys, on whom 
a modern headmaster most relies, were the ringleaders in 
insubordination. 
3. The moral atmosphere was never good, and was 
sometimes indescribably bad. ‘‘A boy who passed un- 
scathed the ordeal of a Colleger’s life must have been gifted 
in no uncommon degree with purity of mind and strength 
of will’. There was neither influence to encourage good 
nor supervision to check evil. Save during class hours or 
private tuition masters saw nothing of their pupils. If a 
boy had the extreme good fortune to meet neitherimpurity, 
drunkenness, gambling, or open profanity, even so he 
would meet no elevating influence. His life was that of 
a slave till he grew strong enough to be a tyrant. Then too 
often the joy of feeling free was intensified by showing that 
he could bully his weaker schoolfellows. 
4. School games were only taking shape during this

period; no headmaster yet counted them as a means of 
training character. In James’s school-days battledore, 
tops, hoops, and a host of forgotten games were as recog- 
nised relaxations for an Etonian as cricket, football, fives 
or tennis?, and hoops at least survived for another fifty 
years. By 1830, however, natural selection seems to have 
done its work. In view of these facts the suggestion that 
the Duke of Wellington’s oft-quoted remark referred, not 
to the games, but to the fights which took place on the 
“playing fields of Eton” seems plausible. 
' This brief account is enough to show that two possi- 
bilities only existed; either the public schools must be 
reformed from within, or the whole system must be swept 
away, as it was swept away in Prussia by Humboldt and 
Stein. The evils were too deep-rooted to be eradicated 
merely by administrative action from without. Nothing 
but the life-work of men who combined great force of will 
and moral earnestness with consummate tact and the gift 
of influencing the boys could suffice for the task.

  CHAPTER II 
CLASSICAL HUMANISM 
HE enlargement of classical studies, whereby to the 
old idea of “pure scholarship” was added the concep- 
tion of opening up the life and thought of antiquity as an 
avenue to the better comprehension of modern problems, 
was in point of time the first of the great educational 
revivals of the nineteenth century. It was largely an 
Oxford movement, and by reason of the post hoc ergo 
propter hoc fallacy was long believed to be a direct outcome 
of the new examination statute. That statute was itself 
the outcome of the more serious attitude to life which 
became common towards the end of the eighteenth century 
and which produced a more zealous type of college tutor; 
this quickening of intellectual activity co-operated with 
the stimulus and guidance of studies supplied by the new 
statute, to promote work among the undergraduates, at 
first on the old scholarly lines; but in course of time, under 
the influence of the Greek revival in Germany, which took 
place in the latter half of the eighteenth century, the newer 
classical humanism emerged. The change took, however, 
a considerable time, and was not complete till the fifties. 
But in the long run the new zeal, which, had it not been 
replenished by a force more potent than linguistic interest, 
would probably have died down after a short blaze of 
fiery energy, was rendered permanent by the discovery 
of the many messages which ancient Greece had to give 
to modern England. What were these messages and why 
did they appeal more to the early Victorian age than to 
preceding periods? 
In the first place, modern democracy was coming to 
birth. Since 1689 the constitutional machinery of parlia- 
mentary government had been so worked out that there
-P-A-G-E-40
  26 CLASSICAL HUMANISM [cu. 
was prepared a healthy body into which modern democracy 
could enter as its soul. In France there was no such body 
and the ideas underlying the French Revolution had 
remained an aspiration. In England for a time the body 
refused to let the soul enter. Then it was that democrats 
turned to ancient Greece and Rome. Here alone were to 
be found important communities which had long main- 
tained what at least appeared to themselves to be demo- 
cratic institutions. These democratic communities had, 
moreover, originated everything except Christianity which 
was most valuable in modern civilisation. Democratic 
Greece had created art, science, literature, and philosophy: 
democratic Rome had laid the foundations on which the 
Empire built the edifice of law. The democrat could always 
turn to classical history when he wished to show what his 
principles could accomplish. Moreover, he could find in it 
guidance as well as stimulus. Modern Europe appeared to 
be evolving on much the same lines as Rome or as the Greek 
republics; and, whereas modern history showed only the 
first half of the story—the rise of states and their transition 
towards democracy—ancient history completed it with 
the decline and fall. By studying the causes, first of the 
rise, then of the stability, and finally of the decline of the 
ancient communities, it was possible to acquire a political 
sagacity which could be applied to maintaining modern 
states and modern civilisation and to avoiding the dangers 
to which they were exposed at different stages in their evolu- 
tion. The stimulus which stirred Grote to write his History 
of Greece was not antiquarianism but zeal for modern 
liberalism. As Thomas Arnold put it, “Aristotle and Plato, 
and Thucydides, and Cicero, and Tacitus, are most untruly 
called ancient writers; they are virtually our own country- 
men and contemporaries, but have the advantage which 
is enjoyed by intelligent travellers, that their observation 
has been exercised in a field outside the reach of common 
men; and that, having thus seen in a manner with our eyes 
what we cannot see for ourselves, their conclusions are such 
as bear upon our own circumstances, while their informa- 
tion has all the charm of novelty, and all the value of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
    11] CLASSICAL HUMANISM 27 
mass of new and pertinent facts, illustrative of the great 
science of the nature of civilised man.” 
In the second place, the French Illumination had striven 
to undermine the Christian basis of morals. No society 
can exist without a moral code, and the moral code of 
Europe had been built on the foundation of the Christian 
religion. It is true that in England the followers of Voltaire 
were few in number. Indeed religion was far more potent 
than it had been a century before. The leaders of thought 
were now for the most part sincere Christians, whereas in 
the earlier period belief was often assumed from a notion 
that religion was a useful restraining force upon the masses. 
The Wesleyan and Evangelical movements had greatly 
increased the influence of Christianity over motive. But 
the more thoughtful Christians saw the danger of sitting 
still in the hope that, in an age of criticism, young men of 
enquiring minds would be content to believe in Christianity 
merely because they had been taught it in childhood. The 
more thoughtful theists who did not accept or were doubt- 
ful about Christianity were equally afraid of bare negation. 
Eighteenth century France had been destructive; nine- 
teenth century England strove to be constructive. The 
situation was not unlike that at Athens, when, traditional 
beliefs having been shaken by the Sophists, Plato turned 
the tables on the destructive critics by showing the weakness 
of their own position. Once more Greek philosophy could 
be studied in the same spirit as that of Plato’s original 
audience, as an antidote to the corrosive power of negation, 
which appeared to be dissolving the mortar that bound 
society together. Here was the thought of the most in- 
tellectual race that had ever lived, earlier than any of the 
great Western religions, evolved more from the brain than 
from the emotions, the result of reflection and not of 
authority, which nevertheless in essentials supported a 
belief in the divine ordering of the world, in the inadequacy 
of purely materialistic explanations, and in the need of an 
accepted code of morals which should include among other 
essentials respect for the State.

In the third place, a new spirit was animating art and 
literature. The cold marble statue felt the warm blood in 
its veins and the warm breath in its nostrils. Formal 
stately ‘‘classicism” might well receive the homage of 
courtiers accustomed to the palace of a Louis XIV; but 
men who had not learned to suppress their feelings at the 
demand of etiquette still felt it to be true that mentem 
mortalia tangunt. The emotions were coming to their own. 
The ‘‘ Augustan period” had made an unreasonable divorce 
between form and the feelings which form exists to express. 
Romanticism was the reaction, when men rebelled against 
the restrictions which form appeared to impose. It began 
to be seen that the so-called “classicism” of the preceding 
period had caught only one aspect of the genuine classical 
spirit. The very phrase ‘‘Augustan” bewrayed it. The 
principate of Augustus had produced masterpieces of form, 
but it was essentially an imitative and not an originative 
epoch. For originality, for the ideas, aspirations, and 
feelings which had brought classical literature into being, 
it was seen that we must look not to Rome but to Greece. 
It was seen too that these things cannot remain fixed unless 
they are to become wholly artificial, but that, while they 
cannot be transferred unchanged from one age to another, 
they can stimulate another age to ideas, aspirations, and 
feelings of its own. The Renaissance had erred in this 
respect. It produced a Shakespeare indeed but it had not 
aimed at so doing. Its conscious aim was to revive classical 
modes of thought and the classical forms in which to 
express them. The newer Renaissance sucked the flowers 
of Hymettus to make honey that should be all its own. 
The spirit of independence and originality was of Greek 
stock even when it was displacing classic architecture by 
Gothic and seeing Nature withits naked eye and not through 
the glass of ancient literature. A revaluation of classical 
authors resulted. It cannot be claimed that the new 
estimate is true absolutely and for ever; it may in part have 
been anticipated by some of the thinkers of that many- 
sided movement, the Renaissance: but it can fairly be 
asserted that the balance was more correctly adjusted than 
   
-P-A-G-E-43

ever before and that the truer values were more widely 
accepted. Homer took precedence over Vergil, Aeschylus 
over Euripides, Plato over Cicero, Thucydides over 
Plutarch. 
Perhaps the common factor in all three new appeals 
may be expressed by saying that the new age was con- 
scious of unsolved problems whereas the older generation 
believed that all problems had been solved by the ancients. 
Both beliefs give a value to literature, history, and philo- 
sophy, but the value is different. The old age believed that 
a full knowledge of religious and philosophic truth, and 
perfect political institutions, had been attained. Philosophy 
could therefore be expounded as a formal and logical 
system. As such it made a cold appeal to the intellect, 
but, if it were to influence motive, it needed the aid of 
literature with its concrete examples to stimulate the 
imagination in matters of personal conduct, and history 
to fill the same réle in matters of public conduct. Under 
such a system art had little to do but to please the taste. 
But to an age which is conscious of unsolved problems, the 
values are quite different. The problems of life are not 
wholly intellectual; it is a sense of values which creates the 
craving for their solution. Literature or art may be the 
agency which awakens a sense that a problem exists; they 
will certainly enhance the feeling of its importance; and 
it is even possible that they will suggest a solution. This is 
why Plato, the artistic philosopher, and Aeschylus, the 
philosophic artist, appealed so much more strongly to the 
new age than to the old. History too was no longer an 
exhibition of models for imitation, buta means of suggesting, 
clarifying and partially solving, problems concerned with 
human society. Thucydides and Tacitus were the two 
historians who appeared most “philosophic” to the new 
age. 
England was striving to reconcile political liberty with 
obedience to law, moral liberty with obedience to duty, 
and intellectual liberty with religion. Her thinkers were 
seeking to harmonise to the intellect those principles which 
her people instinctively seek to combine in their actions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  30 CLASSICAL HUMANISM (cH. 
It was a typically English reaction against the intellectual 
tendency which had come in from France in the preceding 
century, dictated by a fear lest the former member of each 
pair of contending principles was obtaining an undue 
preponderance. The movement was greatly influenced by 
contemporary German thought, but only by certain lines 
of that thought. 
It may be therefore useful to distinguish three tendencies 
in German thought which have manifested themselves in 
the last century and a half. The first embodies that “‘ divine 
discontent” with the limitations which necessity imposes 
on human knowledge and human activity, of which Goethe 
stands as the representative. From it sprang the efforts 
to plumb the depths of philosophy, mysticism, and the 
best of German literature. In its highest form it was 
inspired by Greece. It was this Graeco-German spirit 
which inspired Coleridge and became a powerful influence 
in England. On its dangerous side it became a rebellious 
spirit, the spirit of Faust, without the restraining power of 
the Greek aié@s. Eventually this side triumphed, and we 
have the two consummate rebels, Nietsche, rebel against 
destiny, and Karl Marx, rebel against society. Milton’s 
conception of Satan might have been enlarged to embrace 
both, had he been alive to witness their deification of the 
revolt against human limitation. Discontent may be divine 
or diabolic. The diabolic kind helped to drive men like 
Newman into the arms of authority. 
The second tendency was the analytic or critical, which 
sought to understand the feelings which the first sought 
to actualise. Art, literature, philosophy, and history came 
to the seers permeated with values; the critics sought to 
analyse the values, to show how they were transmitted by 
these media, and to estimate their validity. In each case 
there was a historical criticism and a philosophical criticism. 
History, for instance, embraced both an investigation of 
the truth of records and an interpretation of the significance 
of the facts thus verified. Philosophy involved both a 
historical enquiry into the rise of old beliefs and an attempt 
to construct a new system. Art and literature needed, on
-P-A-G-E-45
  1] CLASSICAL HUMANISM 31 
the one hand, an enquiry into the authorship of various 
works and the conditions under which they had been created, 
on the other, an estimate of their permanent worth. In all 
of these directions Germany led the way. In many cases 
England was long content merely to accept the results; 
but on the whole she was more influenced by the philo- 
sophical criticism, or estimate of values, than by the his- 
torical. Gradually a tendency arose in Germany to value 
novelty too highly. There can never be too much criticism 
so long as it is honestly directed to the search for truth. But 
it may have another motive, desire for reputation; and 
academic reputations in Germany came to depend too much 
on novelty, and too little on soundness of judgment. 
England’s inferiority in original work saved her from this 
danger. She accepted many of the German contributions 
to a fuller understanding of the meaning of history, art, 
and literature, but was cautious in what she accepted. If, 
for instance, the acceptance of Niebuhr’s criticism of early 
Roman traditions was a gain, a somewhat flippant sceptic- 
ism as to the later theory which sought to reduce Troy 
to a sun-myth was no loss, and a non-committal attitude to 
Wolf’s theory that the Iliad was formed by the union of 
numerous lays into one poem proved in the long run to 
be sound policy. It took nearly a century before the en- 
couragement of original work became a prominent feature 
in English universities; but, if not original, our universities 
were at least eminently sane. 
The third feature was the careful fostering of education 
by the State, which we may regard as part of the efficient 
State control of everything, which was Prussia’s special 
contribution to the life of Germany in the nineteenth 
century. In organisation, as in the two characteristics 
which we have been previously considering, there was a 
good and a bad side, and the good side was apparent first. 
Germany had a good school in every town a hundred years 
before England had a moderate one. Two universities long 
satisfied England, for a similar population twenty would 
have been considered necessary in Germany. But England 
has preserved elasticity and liberty. We are tempted to
-P-A-G-E-46
32 CLASSICAL HUMANISM [cH. 
think of the universal admiration which was felt by an 
earlier age for the efficiency of the Jesuit education; and 
  then to remember that a century and a half later the 
rigidity of its bonds was seen to be strangling intellectual 
development. There is a close parallel, though the object 
of Jesuit education was to maintain a particular theological 
system and that of Prussian education was to maintain 
a particular political system. 
After this digression we will return to the classical 
revival. So wide a movement can best be understood by 
taking typical representatives of its various aspects; we 
shall therefore group its history round the personalities 
of three men, very unlike in all other ways, but all shaped 
by its influence, Thomas Arnold, Newman, and Mark 
Pattison. 
The account which Mr Justice Coleridge wrote of Arnold’s 
undergraduate days for Stanley’s Life—Arnold entered 
Corpus when he was. only sixteen years of age—gives a 
vivid picture of the intellectual activity of a small college 
which had been influenced by the revival of a working 
spirit, and shows how the mutual intercourse of inquisitive 
minds led them to connect classical studies with the real 
problems of life. Such an attitude was still far from common 
and Coleridge is clearly still under the sway of the older 
scholarly ideal. He laments that Arnold ‘‘did not leave 
the college with scholarship proportioned to his great 
abilities and opportunities.” ‘This,’ he adds, ‘‘arose in 
part from the decided preference which he gave to the 
philosophers and historians of antiquity over the poets, 
coupled with the distinction which he then made, erroneous 
as I think, and certainly extreme in degree, between words 
and things, as he termed it.’’ Arnold went up in 1811: 
forty years later the distinction was more fully recognised. 
The college consisted of twenty fellows, twenty scholars 
(some of whom were graduates, as bachelors were obliged 
to reside) and six gentlemen commoners; there were no 
commoners. Hence workers predominated, and the small- 
ness of numbers threw men of all years. together. The 
scholars had their junior common room; “we lived on the
-P-A-G-E-47
  1] CLASSICAL HUMANISM 33 
most familiar terms with each other; we might be, indeed 
we were, somewhat boyish in manner, and in the liberties 
which we took with each other; but our interest in litera- 
ture, ancient and modern, and in all the stirring events of 
that stirring time was not boyish; we debated the classic 
and romantic question; we discussed poetry and history, 
logic and philosophy; or we fought over the Peninsular 
battles and the continental campaigns with the energy of 
disputants personally concerned in them.” Such inter- 
course, Coleridge points out, had an even greater share in 
forming the outlook of those who shared it than the college 
tuition. Knowledge and scholarship may come from good 
teaching, but to produce thought there is nothing like the 
free air of a university. 
From Corpus Arnold went to join a society which has 
left a permanent impress on English university life, the 
senior common room of Oriel. We have seen how the new 
examination statute was carried by three heads of houses, 
Cyril Jackson of Christ Church, Eveleigh of Oriel, and 
Parsons of Balliol. Each of these colleges in turn took an 
intellectual lead within the university. Christ Church had 
an extraordinary predominance in the class lists up to 
18371 and produced the two most famous of our nineteenth 
century statesmen, Peel and Gladstone: then it fell with 
a drop. Eveleigh (1781-1814), however, laid the foundation 
for the predominance of Oriel by inducing his colleagues— 
no easy task, we may imagine—to throw open fellowships 
to open competition. Hitherto colleges had restricted 
their choice to their own members and were in the ‘habit 
of choosing pleasant companions in preference to men of 
greater intellectual force. Henceforth Oriel fellowships won 
a reputation as a surer test of real capacity than even the 
honours examinations of the university. Mark Pattison 
writes’, “For nearly thirty years the examinations for 
Oriel fellowships were conducted upon the principle of 
ascertaining, not what a man had read, but what he was 
like. The prizes or classes which a candidate might bring

with him to the competition were wholly disregarded by 
the electors, who looked at his papers unbiassed by opinion 
outside.... Perhaps the word which best expresses what was 
looked for...is originality.” 
He goes on to point out that the Noetics, as the famous 
band of Oriel fellows in the twenties came to be called, 
were rather opinionated; they knew little of continental 
thought, of Kant or of Rousseau; but they maintained 
a “wholesome intellectual ferment.” Brodrick! desctibes 
them as “a select body, somewhat inclined to mutual 
admiration, producing little but freely criticising every- 
thing”: they “applied an unsparing logic to received 
opinions, especially those concerning religious faith, but 
their strength lay rather in drawing inferences and in 
refuting fallacies than in examining and settling the 
premises from which their syllogisms were deduced.” That 
independence of judgment prevailed at Oriel is obvious 
if we set the names of Whateley, Arnold, and Hampden 
against those of Newman, Keble, and Hurrell Froude?. 
Such was Oriel before the Tractarian Movement. 
The provost during Arnold’s time was Copleston (1814- 
1827), who likewise came from Corpus. A stately don of 
the old school, he well-nigh ruled the university. He en- 
joyed a reputation beyond the limits of Oxford and was 
consulted by Peel on economic questions; he advocated 
reforms which the majority of Oxonians regarded as 
dangerous innovations even in the fifties; he put in order 
the college finances; and he was afterwards a reforming 
bishop. But it is curious to notice how men who are 
pushing reforms from within will resent almost identical 
criticism from without. The Edinburgh Review commenced 
a series of attacks, mainly true in substance but hostile in 
form, against the English universities. Playfair, Jeffrey 
and Sidney Smith were the leaders;.and the attack was 
directed equally against the classical and the mathematical 
instruction. Copleston took up the cudgels and was believed

by Oxonians to have routed his opponents. Reply and 
counter-reply followed; and the language which was used 
frequently went beyond what would now be considered 
seemly in academic discussions. Yet the following would 
appear to be a just description of the attitude which the 
Noetics were striving to overthrow. “There is a timid and 
absurd apprehension on the part of ecclesiastical tutors 
of letting out the minds of youth upon difficult and im- 
portant subjects. They fancy that mental exertion must 
end in religious scepticism; and, to preserve the principles 
of their pupils, they confine them to the safe and elegant 
imbecility of classical learning. A genuine Oxford tutor 
would shudder to hear his young men disputing upon moral 
and political truth, forming and pulling down theories, 
and indulging in all the boldness of youthful discussion!.” 
And the next quotation would appear to express exactly 
Arnold’s objection to the predominance of words over 
things. “A classical scholar of twenty-three or twenty- 
four years of age is a man principally conversant with 
works of imagination. His feelings are quick, his fancy 
lively, and his taste good. Talents for speculation and 
original enquiry he has none; nor has he formed the 
invaluable habit of pushing things up to their first principles, 
or of collecting dry and uninteresting facts as material of 
reasoning. He hates the pain of thinking and suspects 
every man whose boldness and originality call upon him 
to defend his opinions and prove his assertions?.” Scholars 
have come to value “‘not the filbert but the shell, not what 
may be read in Greek but Greek itself’.”” The absence of 
a working atmosphere, the failure of fellows to make 
contributions to learning, their ignorance of the latest 
researches, the neglect of mathematics at Oxford, and a 
tendency to cling to obsolete mathematical methods at 
Cambridge, were other matters of attack. Copleston’s 
replies are extraordinary evidence how far we have travelled 
since his day. Indeed to a modern reader they are stronger 
evidence of the justice of the attacks than anything con- 
tained in the attacks themselves. It is hard to realise that

a man who was regarded by his contemporaries as among 
the ablest Oxonians of his day both intellectually and 
practically should, in carrying on a discussion, be so 
completely unable to distinguish the wood for the trees. 
He spends more time in defending himself from a charge 
of a small slip in his Greek than in meeting serious attacks 
on the Oxford system; he indulges in trivial attacks on the 
opponent’s attorney; and he tediously replies to the charges 
sentence by sentence when a few decisive thrusts might 
have given him the victory. Yet he was all for giving that 
training “‘in seizing the strong point in any subject” which 
made argument in the Coplestonian style an impossibility 
for the next generation. 
In view of the evidence presented by the attacks of the 
Edinburgh Review, by Copleston’s defence, by Coleridge’s 
attitude, and by Mark Pattison’s account of teaching in 
his undergraduate days, we feel justified in holding that 
Arnold was the first man, not only in English schools but 
in English universities, who realised the opportunity which 
classical instruction offered as an introduction of the pupil 
to ethical, philosophical, and political problems and who 
illustrated it in practice in such a way as to evoke imita- 
tion. The Reviewers had the idea; the Noetics studied 
classics in this spirit; but Arnold was the first man known 
to have taught them in it. Dean Stanley’s account, though 
hackneyed, must be quoted}. “‘He was the first English- 
man who drew attention in our public schools””—this, we 
suppose, is generally admitted—“ to the historical, political, 
and philosophical value...of the ancient writers, as dis- 
tinguished from the mere verbal criticism and elegant 
scholarship of the last century.” ‘‘His whole method was 
founded on the principle of awakening the intellect of every 
individual boy. Hence it was his practice to teach by 
questioning ;...and his questions were of a kind to call the 
attention of the boys to the real point of every subject 
and to disclose to them the exact boundaries of what they 
knew or did not know....In proportion to their advance 
in the school he tried to cultivate in them a habit not only 
1 Life of Thomas Arnold, ch. 1, pp. 136-142.
-P-A-G-E-51
1] CLASSICAL HUMANISM 37 
of collecting facts but of expressing themselves with 
facility, and of understanding the principles on which 
their facts rested. “You come here,’ he said, ‘not to read 
but to learn how to read.’”’ “Hence also he not only laid 
great stress on original compositions, but endeavoured so 
to choose the subjects of exercises as to oblige them to 
read and lead them to think for themselves.’ ‘‘Style, 
knowledge, correctness or incorrectness of statement or 
expression, he always disregarded in comparison with 
indication or promise of real thought. ‘I call that the best 
theme,’ he said, ‘which shows that the boy has read and 
thought for himself, that the next best which shows that 
he has read several books and digested what he has read, 
and that the worst which shows that he has followed but 
one book and followed that without reflection.’” Arnold’s 
work was done in a school, but it was long before pure 
scholarship became infused with the new spirit in schools 
generally. Indeed Mark Pattison states that up to 1834 
“scholarship”’ still maintained the premier place at Oxford 
in the school of Litterae Humaniores; and that a period 
ensued in which what was expected was a ‘“‘ knowledge of 
the books” “ page by page” rather than a critical reflection 
on them; in fact it was not till the fifties that this school 
definitely assumed a philosophical biast. 
The new humanism presented many shapes as it was 
refracted through the media of different temperaments. 
Arnold’s was the religious spirit cast in a Protestant mould. 
He is akin to Plato in one of his aspects, as the great Greek 
puritan. To Arnold the chief revelation of God was to be 
found in history, and this was why classical history appealed 
to him so intensely. Progress was divinely directed. Jews, 
Greeks, and Romans were the three chosen peoples of 
ancient times. Their history was directed on converging 
lines with Christianity as their meeting-point. As before 
Christ States were the appointed means of drawing men 
nearer to God, so was it God’s purpose that they should be 
afterwards. The sanctification of the State was the goal 
of progress. Man, as Aristotle held, can only be perfect

in society; hence individual perfection and the perfection 
of society must go hand in hand. The greater the approxi- 
mation to perfection, the more do Church and State become 
identical; for they are composed of the same persons. Their 
relations to God, which constitute them a Church, deter- 
mine their attitude to each other, when they are regarded 
as a State. Education is engaged in showing the purpose 
of God for the individual and for the world; its chief sub- 
jects are therefore (1) the Christian religion, (2) the Jewish, 
Greek, and Roman civilisations, as revealed in their 
literature and in their history, and (3) modern history. 
Such is education on its intellectual side; on the side of 
will and feeling it acts through a miniature Christian 
society in school or university, which are training grounds 
for the larger Christian societies of Church and State. 
Arnold’s practice accorded with his theories. 
Newman equally represents the religious spirit, but his 
temperament was conservative whereas Arnold’s was 
liberal. By this we mean that, if a new movement arose, 
Arnold’s eye was instinctively cast on the opportunities 
of so guiding the movement that it might increase the sum 
of righteousness, whereas Newman instinctively looked at 
the dangers to the cause of righteousness which might 
accrue from the disturbance of existing opinions or in- 
stitutions. Hence Arnold remained a Noetic to the end; 
but Newman, as he saw more fully the directions in which 
free enquiry might lead, became alarmed. He recognised, 
like Arnold, a divine guidance of events, but for him it 
was that kind of guidance which operates by ‘turning 
even the madness of men” to fulfil the divine will. Should 
we liken the forces of change to a river, Arnold saw the 
Spirit of God in the stream itself, Newman only in some 
power which should embank it. So embanked it could be 
made to subserve the good; but in itself it had the nature 
of evil. From an early period he recognised this regulating 
power as being the Church; but, whereas in 1833 he looked 
to the Anglican Church, in 1845 he seceded to Rome. In 
1852, in a series of lectures to the “Catholic University of 
Ireland,” he published his theory of the functions of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-53

university!. It is a masterly harmonisation of Catholicism 
and contemporary Oxonianism, and it remains the out- 
standing and classic exposition of the latter. 
As a Catholic, Newman refuses to accept Arnold’s view 
that intellectual education can make a man better or more 
religious, and that this is its highest aim. The Church alone 
pronounces on faith and morals; the individual man must 
believe and obey. Why then is it better to be educated 
than not to be educated? His answer is that a sound 
intellectual condition is in itself a good, just as a healthy 
bodily condition is in itself a good. In what, he goes on to 
ask, does this healthy condition of mind consist? The 
English language, he replies, contains no exact word for 
it; neither wisdom nor knowledge nor learning gives the 
right idea. It is certainly not professional skill; for that 
is a means to something else, whereas the healthy mental 
state is an end in itself—the end sought by a liberal, as 
opposed to a professional, education. Rather it consists 
“not merely in the passive reception into the mind of a 
number of ideas hitherto unknown to it, but in the mind’s 
simultaneous action upon and towards and among these 
ideas....It is the action of a formative power, reducing to 
order and meaning the matter of our acquirements; it is 
a making the objects of our knowledge subjectively our 
own, or, to use a familiar word, it is a digestion of what 
we receive into the substance of our previous state of 
thought....It possesses the knowledge not only of things, 
but also of their relations; knowledge, not merely con- 
sidered as acquirement, but as philosophy?.’’ The 
description of the healthy intellectual state is pure 
Oxonianism; its dissociation from morals and religion is 
Catholicism. 
He next turns to the subject-matter of a healthy intel- 
lectual training. Since beliefs true in themselves may be 
a source of error if not seen in all their relations, specialisa- 
tion is an evil. Yet itis necessary for professional efficiency: 
therefore a liberal education steps in as a prophylactic. 
“Men whose minds are possessed by some one object take

  40 CLASSICAL HUMANISM [cu. 
exaggerated views of its importance,...make it the measure 
of things which are utterly foreign to it, and are startled 
and despond if it fail them....But the intellect which has 
been disciplined to the perfection of its powers, which 
knows, and thinks while it knows,...cannot be exclusive, 
cannot be impetuous, cannot be at a loss.... That perfection 
of the Intellect which is the result of education...is the 
clear, calm, accurate vision and comprehension of all things, 
as far as the finite mind can embrace them, each in its 
place, and with its own characteristics upon itt.’’ The 
characteristics therefore of a liberal education are, first, 
that it is a training in this “philosophical” habit of mind 
which looks for relations and co-ordinates its knowledge; 
secondly, that it deals more with the “‘architectonic” 
sciences, that is, those which best serve to decide the 
relations of the others to the scheme of knowledge as a 
whole.—Thus far goes contemporary Oxford; the end is 
Rome. Man is related to things, to man, and to God; but 
the last relation is the most fundamental of the three, and 
the second more important than the first. Theology, as 
taught by the Church, is therefore the most “architectonic” 
of the sciences; and other sciences will be good or bad in 
proportion as they are studied with this background. 
Arnold on the other hand would have looked on the scheme 
of knowledge, not as a building of which theology was the 
cornerstone, but as a flight of steps of which it was the 
top; our knowledge of the will of God was to be reached by 
reflection on the physical world and on human history. 
The architectonic hierarchy of the sciences determined 
for Newman that all must be taught in a Catholic atmo- 
sphere; it also established a superiority of the humanities 
over the physical sciences. In arguing this second position 
he quotes from his old friend Keble?, who remained an 
Anglican; and the quotation is as good a statement of the 
newer humanistic position as could be found. Keble had 
called the nameless intellectual quality which Newman 
conceives as the health of the mind by the title of “judg- 
ment.” Judgment, he affirmed, “‘lives by comparison and 
* pp. 137-139. * pp. 174-6.
-P-A-G-E-55
  1] CLASSICAL HUMANISM 4z 
discrimination”; it gives the student “strength in any 
subject he chooses to grapple with and enables him to seize 
the strong point in it.”” ‘To do any good to the judgment, 
the mind must be employed upon such subjects as come 
within the cognizance of that faculty and give some real 
exercise to its perception. Here we have a rule of selection 
by which the different parts of learning may be classed 
for our purpose. Those which belong to the province of 
the judgment are religion,...ethics, history, eloquence, 
poetry, theories of general speculation, the fine arts, and 
works of wit.’ All these ‘‘are necessary mutually to 
explain and interpret each other. The knowledge derived 
from them all will amalgamate.” But further, “‘if different 
studies are useful for aiding, they are still more useful for 
correcting each other; for, as they have their peculiar 
merits severally, so they have their defects, and the most 
extensive acquaintance with one can produce only an 
intellect either too flashy or too jejune, or infected with 
some other fault of confused reading. History, for example, 
shows things as they are, that is, the morals and interests 
of men disfigured and perverted by all their imperfections 
of passion, folly, and ambition; philosophy strips the 
picture too much; poetry adorns it too much; the con- 
centrated lights of all three correct the false peculiar 
colouring of each and show us the truth.” The defence of 
the classical course as it was in process of being reshaped 
at Oxford therefore was that the three means to seeing 
life steadily and seeing it whole were pure literature, history, 
and philosophy; and that in the literature of ancient 
Greece there was ready at hand a combination of great 
poets and orators, historians and philosophers, which was 
unique. Their study presented two great advantages; first, 
it was the best available means of understanding “hu- 
manity,” if the word may be used to signify all which 
concerns human relations; secondly, it was a training in 
the ‘“‘philosophic” habit of looking for the relations and 
significance of the facts which are learned, without which 
any kind of knowledge is worthless. 
Newman, writing in the fifties, acknowledges that  
-P-A-G-E-56
42 CLASSICAL HUMANISM (cH. 
natural science, like all kinds of knowledge, possesses a 
value in itself as knowledge, apart from the specific pro- 
fessional values of separate branches. But the Oriel fellows 
in the heroic age of the College had been hardly brought 
into contact with natural science, though one of the most 
lovable of their number, Baden Powell, was a scientist: 
but such was the condition of science in Oxford that, 
when he was appointed Savilian professor of Geometry in 
1827, Copleston advised him that it would be useless for 
him to lecture, as he would not get an audience, and that 
it would be better for him to devote himself to research!. 
Science was in fact treated as a hobby of a few eccentric 
dons, such as Buckland, for whom the Prince Regent 
erected a professorship of geology, or Daubeny, who 
combined the professorships of chemistry, botany, and 
rural economy’. It was not till the great change in attitude 
which followed Newman’s secession in 1845 that Oxford 
awoke to the existence of science as a serious claimant to 
a place within the temple of knowledge, and that Acland 
carried through his scheme for the building of a scientific 
museum, to which a band of artists, including Burne- 
Jones and Morris, devoted unsparing endeavours to make 
the shrine worthy of the newly deified muse. When we 
find even Jowett treating these claims as menacing “‘the 
higher conception of knowledge and of the mind” and 
antagonistic to “morals and religion and philosophy and 
history and language,’ we are not surprised to learn that 
Keble led the theologians to an attack on geology as 
unscriptural, or that Newman considers that the value 
which he theoretically allows to science might be purchased 
at the cost of greater evils. But it is at a period later than 
the thirties that science was sufficiently recognised to 
become a subject for attacks. 
In addition to aim and subject-matter a complete theory 
of a liberal university education must also embrace a view 
on method. “If I had to choose,’’ writes Newman, “‘be-

tween a so-called university which dispensed with residence ~ 
and tutorial superintendence and gave its degrees to any 
person who passed an examination in a wide range of 
subjects and a university which had no professors or 
examinations at all, but merely brought a number of 
young men together for three or four years, and then sent 
them away as the University of Oxford is said to have done 
some sixty years since, if I were asked which of these two 
methods was the better discipline of the intellect—mind, 
I do not say, which is morally the better, for it is plain 
that compulsory study must be a good and idleness an 
intolerable mischief—but if I must determine which of 
the two courses was the more successful in training, 
moulding, enlarging the mind, which sent out men the 
more fitted for secular duties, which produced better 
public men, men of the world, men whose names would 
descend to posterity, I have no hesitation in giving the 
preference to that university which did nothing, over that 
which exacted of its members an acquaintance with every 
science under the sun!.” The importance thus attached 
to intercourse surmounts the difficulty that, while the 
studies of a university must be encyclopaedic, the teachers 
at least must be specialists. They are saved from the evils 
of specialism by contact with specialists in other branches. 
“There will be this distinction as regards a professor of 
law or of medicine or of geology or of political economy 
in a university and out of it, that out of a university he 
- is in danger of being absorbed and narrowed by his 
pursuit, and of giving lectures which are the lectures of 
nothing more than a lawyer, physician, geologist, or 
political economist; whereas in a university he will know 
just where he and his science stand®.”’ Similarly all students 
will not study theology, but all will be in contact with 
theological students in a society in which theology is 
studied. 
When we compare Newman’s ideal with the account of 
Oxford given by Sir William Hamilton, by the Edinburgh 
Reviewers who renewed their attacks in 1830, by Mark 
1 The Idea of a University, p. 145. 2 p. 166.

  44 CLASSICAL HUMANISM [cH. 
~ Pattison in his Memoirs, and by the evidence given before 
the Royal Commission, we feel at first at a loss to explain 
the glaring contrast. Yet it is not hard to explain. The 
reformers of 1800 found in existence a state of things in 
which the bulk of undergraduates were unaccustomed to 
serious study and the bulk of tutors to serious teaching. 
Few fellows of colleges kept up their studies by reading, 
though intellectual conversation was sometimes studied 
as a fine art in common rooms. The idea of making new 
contributions to learning, even of following the new con- 
tributions which were being made abroad, was unknown. 
A minority of intellectual tutors carried the new examina- 
tion statute; a minority of working undergraduates 
occupied the places in the class lists. This minority needed 
a new type of instruction; but, before tutors realised how 
greatly the position had changed, they were left behind. 
When lecturing on authors, they knew nothing to say which 
was not to be found in the printed editions; and they were 
only awaking to a realisation of the wider philosophical, 
historical, and literary topics, for a discussion of which the 
authors might be made the text. Hence the demand of 
Hamilton and the promoters of the Royal Commission for 
specialist professors. The Oriel band were composed of 
the first batch of working undergraduates who had been 
produced by the new system. Their interests were so wide 
that they did not wish to specialise; as tutors they were 
restless students; they learned the forgotten art of study, 
but they spent their lives in searching for their intellectual 
position. A third generation must arise before tutors were 
sure enough of their position to work out a system of 
instruction. Meanwhile the bulk of undergraduates were 
still passmen, of a low intellectual level; and it was for 
them that college tuition had been designed. Academic 
organisation was lacking in flexibility, and candidates for 
honours were still required to attend those lectures, from 
which they could derive no knowledge or stimulus what- 
ever. Their real work was done privately or with the new 
class of private “coaches” who arose to satisfy the new 
demand, till the third generation of reformers united to
-P-A-G-E-59
  uy CLASSICAL HUMANISM 45 
demand from Lord John Russell the interference of the 
State. In the interval the mind of the university had been 
distracted for twelve years by the controversies arising 
out of the Tractarian movement (1833-1845). 
Still, much was gained. Arnold’s effort to popularise 
Niebuhr was his chief contribution to university study: 
but his work at Rugby on its intellectual side may be 
regarded as working out the school basis on which the 
“philosophising” of the traditional university classical 
course could be built. Foreign influences took long to 
penetrate Oxford, but they came. It was the High Church 
Conservative school who popularised Kant. They found 
a philosophical leader in their Scottish academic critic, 
Sir William Hamilton. If lectures lacked originality and 
were unsuited to the intellectual needs of honours men, 
yet tutors were beginning to be conscientious on their own 
lines. A college lecture was conducted exactly like a lesson 
to a sixth form and was substantially a construing class; 
and this was precisely the point in which the tutors of 
those days saw its advantage. The doctrine that the pupil 
must not be a mere listener, which is a truism of school 
method to-day, was held and practised by our predecessors 
in their instruction in universities. In the great struggle 
between the rival policies of college tuition and a uni- 
versity professoriate, the tutorial party took it for granted 
that the tutor would continue to teach while the professor 
would lecture, and it was on this that they based the tutor’s 
claim to be giving superior instruction. Strangely enough, 
in the older universities, the tutorial system is still pre- 
served, but the modern tutor lectures; while in the modern 
universities there is nominally a professorial system, but 
the professor, like his American colleague, often ‘‘ quizzes.” 
The Tractarian movement, much as it distracted Oxford 
thought from academic reform, was itself a sign of intel- 
lectual life. It was only by reason of the enlarged oppor- 
‘tunities for free thinking that so unconventional a doctrine 
as the unfettered claim of authority over freedom of 
thought was rendered possible. Yet to the opposing school 
of thought which gained the predominance after Newman’s
-P-A-G-E-60
  46 CLASSICAL HUMANISM (cH. 
secession in 1845, the twelve years of Tractarian controversy 
appeared to be an age of scholastic barbarism. Under the 
tule of Hawkins (1828-1874), Oriel undoubtedly lost its 
old prestige. An autocrat who dreaded to be surrounded 
by men of superior ability, he dismissed three of his 
keenest tutors, including Newman, and put in inferior 
but “safe”? men. He damped enthusiasm, became en- 
grossed in detail, and lived in the past. Mark Pattison— 
no very impartial witness, to be sure—describes the leading 
tutors of Oriel after 1831 as “steeped in parochialism,” as 
zealous in study but devoting all their study to theology, 
and as possessing a very limited knowledge of the classics; 
“the college must have become a seminary?.”” 
Newman’s secession seemed to the academic liberals as 
the break-up of an old order; Pattison tells us? how a “flood 
of reform” broke over Oxford, how “in those years every- 
one was a liberal,’ how it seemed ‘‘a deliverance from the 
nightmare” of obscurantism. Two new honours schools 
were instituted in 1852, one of law and history, the other 
of natural science. The museum was built. The Royal 
Commission was appointed. Mill replaced Kant as the 
philosophic guide. The old classical examination was 
divided into two parts, Moderations in the middle of the 
undergraduate’s career, which should embrace pure scholar- 
ship, the poets and orators, and the final school of Litterae 
Humaniores, better known as “Greats,” which henceforth 
became mainly philosophical and historical. Sir William 
Hamilton’s charge that, though parts of philosophical 
authors are read, they are not studied as ‘‘ food for specula- 
tion,’ that memorising of the parts and not a view of a 
work as a whole is what is expected®, ceased to be true. 
Balliol took the intellectual supremacy under the long 
mastership of Jenkyns (1819-1854), who, though neither 
a great scholar nor a commanding personality, was “an 
unfailing judge of a clever man‘,” and, unlike Hawkins, 
showed no jealousy to men abler than himself, but accepted

changes promoted by the fellows, even when he personally 
disapproved. The chief of these was the opening of 
scholarships to free competition in 1828 which made a 
“Balliol” the blue ribbon of schoolboy success. In 1842 
Jowett became tutor, and in this capacity and later as 
master consolidated the ground which Jenkyns had won. 
Mark Pattison was as much an outcome of the classical 
revival as Arnold or Newman, but was in every other respect 
a contrast to them. The son of a commonplace and not 
very religiously-minded country clergyman, he came up to 
Oriel as a shy and awkward freshman in 1830, with an 
ardent love of classical study which his official instructors 
failed to satisfy. In 1839 he obtained a fellowship at 
Lincoln, and for a time came under Tractarian influences, 
which yielded to a profound reaction. His genius was 
brilliant and versatile, with more than a touch of egoism 
and a restless desire to be ever reforming something. “It 
is impossible for me,’’ he confesses, ‘‘to see anything done 
without an immediate suggestion of how it might be better 
done. I cannot travel by railway without working out 
in my mind a better time-table than that in use!.” His 
defeat in his candidature for the rectorship of his college, 
which he not unfairly regarded as an act of jobbery, em- 
bittered him; and his subsequent election did not undo its 
effect on his character. Happy in his hours of study; 
vindictive, melancholy, and pessimistic in his hours of 
thought; taciturn in society; ardent but bitter under 
opposition in his attempts at university reform, he became 
the most brilliant but the saddest figure in mid-Victorian 
Oxford. Impelled by an insatiable craving for efficiency, 
he had none of the hope for the future or the love of his 
fellow men which bestows a blessing on unsuccessful en- 
deavour when it springs from the heart, but could only 
feel the sting of personal failure when the reforms which 
his brilliant intellect was ever suggesting were not carried 
into effect. 
We could almost prophesy from his character how Greek 
literature would affect him, when once his shyness had

been sufficiently overcome to let him follow his own lines. 
Greece was the nation which had first struck out on new 
paths of thought. Wherever Greek literature went, it had 
imparted intellectual life. Pre-existing beliefs and con- 
ventions were powerless before the keen sword thrusts of 
its penetrating analysis. Life had become joyous; thought 
was no longer a burden, but a delightful exercise in a 
boundless, invigorating fresh air; gloom, superstition, and 
fear, the poisonous growths of ignorance, had perished 
when exposed to its health-giving influence. Its restoration 
at the Renaissance had brought civilisation to Europe. 
Pattison was a scholar of the fifteenth century condemned. 
to live in the mid-Victorian age. Having turned his back 
on Tractarianism, he came to feel for the clerical party 
that bitterness which he was too prone to experience 
towards all who did not agree with him. His attitude 
to Greece, his attitude to Christianity, his attitude to 
opponents, can all be seen in one sentence which he wrote 
of Newman, ‘‘He was inspired by the triumph of the 
Church organisation over the wisdom and philosophy of 
the Hellenic world; that triumph which, to the Humanist, 
is the saddest moment in history—the ruin of the painfully 
constructed fabric of civilisation to the profit of the 
Church?.”’ 
In some ways Oxford has followed Pattison’s lead. He 
tells us how he was appointed an examiner along with 
colleagues whose paper qualifications were all better than 
his own, and how he found himself their equal in scholar- 
ship and more than their match in seeing the wider 
bearings of ancient thought”. He claims to have been the 
first lecturer on Aristotle at Oxford who tried to exhibit 
his philosophy as a whole instead of commenting on his 
works section by section®: and this, which is obviously t1e 
right method of dealing with the philosophers and historians 
of antiquity, is now universal. The reforms instituted as 
a result of the Royal Commission, and Pattison’s support 
of the professorial system, must be considered in a later 
chapter. But, generally speaking, we may say that, as

regards his attempt to follow the German system and 
introduce the student to specialised research in his under- 
graduate days, Oxford did not follow him. He was not 
satisfied with the form which the school of Litterae 
Humaniores was assuming and has since retained. ‘“ The 
guantity of original writing produced in” the three hours 
allowed for each paper “‘is in itself surprising. But the 
quality is more so. The best papers are no mere schoolboys’ 
themes spun out with hackneyed commonplaces, but full 
of life and thought, abounding with all the ideas with 
which modern society and its best current literature are 
charged. So totally false are those platform denunciations 
of the Oxford classical system which assume that it leads 
its alumni in old-world notions and occupies them with 
matters remote from modern interests.” Yet he thinks that 
the system has done its work. “The philosophical has 
been a transition stage, by which we have risen above the 
mere ‘belletristic’ treatment of classical literature.” His 
objection to the “philosophical” stage is that conclusions 
are reached without examining the evidence. “To glean 
rapidly the current ideas floating about in the schools, to 
acquire the knack of dexterous manipulation of the terms 
which express them, to put himself in the hands of a 
practised tutor, to be set in the way of writing in the 
newest style of thought upon every possible subject and 
inserting the quotations from Aristotle in their proper 
place, this is all the student has time to dot.’ The cause is 
that philosophy is taught, not by middle-aged specialists 
who have thoroughly studied one particular branch of the 
subject, but by some young tutor who “reads in his vaca- 
tion or in such moments of leisure as he can snatch the 
last new book on the subject” and ‘becomes of course an 
immediate convert to the theory of the latest speculator?.”’ 
His own desire is to leave Moderations unaltered as an 
examination in scholarship, and to divide the final school 
into specialist philological and classical alternatives, 
banishing philosophy to the Faculty of Law! Thus, having

as it were laid the last brick of the ‘“ philosophical”’ edifice, 
Pattison proceeded to propose its total demolition, and no 
more belongs to the present chapter. Yet we may note 
that the faults which he finds with it consist in precisely 
those features which Newman considered its merits, and 
the issue is virtually between a general education for life 
and a specialised education for academic teaching and 
research. 
The change from the scholarly to the “philosophic” 
ideal hardly affected Cambridge. The Classical Tripos was 
instituted in 1822, but at first only candidates who had 
taken mathematical honours were allowed to sit. Cambridge, 
however, maintained and, if anything emphasised, the 
older tradition of “pure scholarship.’’ Thus, Peacock’s 
desire to abolish verse and Greek prose in order to open 
the classical tripos to candidates who had not specialised 
in classics at school! would meet with a less favourable 
reception among Cambridge tutors now than when it was 
expressed. Indeed there was a marked divergence between 
the two universities: as far as real influence on the thought 
of the nation was concerned, Oxford’s contributions were 
mainly humanistic and those of Cambridge mainly natural- 
istic. 
The change in schools was not so marked as at Oxford. 
The historical and philosophical outlook was only possible 
with the sixth form, and it has taken a long time to realise 
that a boy becomes intellectually, though not emotionally, 
a man at sixteen. Universities influence schools in two 
ways, by the requirements of scholarship examinations, 
which determine the syllabus, and by the mental outfit 
of the teachers who proceed from the universities, which 
determines the unconscious drift and background of the 
teaching. The fact that at Oxford scholarship examinations 
looked more to Moderations than to “Greats” and that 
at Cambridge there was no equivalent for “Greats” con- 
tinued to throw the weight into the scale in favour of good 
composition. It was some time before the essay and the

PP- 157-159.

historical and general questions came to rectify the balance. 
But the mental outfit of teachers often produced a pro- 
found, though unnoticed, effect. And, as the linguistic side 
of classics is being more and more threatened by naturalistic 
studies, the historical, philosophical, social, and political 
content of the humanities, as a means of training citizens, 
and at the higher stages of statesmen, is being more and 
more emphasised. It is not unlikely that, when the general 
study of the classical languages has passed away, the point 
of view as to the aims and methods of study which took 
shape in the course of the new humanistic movement will 
survive in connection with the study of modern literatures, 
modern ‘history, and modern philosophy and _ political 
economy.

  CHAPTER III 
THE REVIVAL IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
N the first three decades of the century the public schools 
were in a parlous state. Their low moral tone, their 
narrow classical curriculum, their poor intellectual results, 
their roughness and bullying, their bad feeding and housing, 
were no longer likely to be tolerated merely because they 
were established institutions. The era of the Reform Act 
knew how to “‘mend or end” institutions which were not 
fulfilling their purpose. Evangelicalism was not tolerant 
of societies which appeared to encourage profanity and 
vice. Outside the circle of parents who were accustomed 
to send their boys to public schools were utilitarians 
demanding a ‘‘modern” curriculum, nonconformists ob- 
jecting to clerical control, and democrats looking for schools 
which should be open to parents of smaller means. 
In Prussia a situation in many respects similar had led 
to the suppression of the old boarding-schools and the 
establishment of a system of first-grade day-schools. The 
work had been carried out in the first decade of the century, 
and the new Gymnasien, as they were termed, had already 
proved themselves a success. In England, in the heyday of 
Individualism, such drastic action by the State was im- 
possible; but, if no reform had come from within, it is hard 
to believe that the public schools could have survived 
another fifty years. Demands for their supersession were 
already beginning to be heard. It has been suggested that 
it would have been better in the long run had they not 
reformed themselves and had they been ultimately 
abolished. It may well be that the needs of the present 
day would be better met by an efficient system of local 
day schools with an atmosphere of work and a strong esprit 
de corps. But could such schools have been erected on the 
ruins of a discredited system? Bedford Grammar School

may be taken to represent the type of school demanded. 
To produce several hundred Bedfords would require 
several hundred first-rate headmasters; and, had they 
existed, they would be almost certain to have reformed the 
existing schools. Probably it was a much smaller number 
who actually achieved the latter task. 
During the years which immediately followed the reform, 
tradition assigned the major portion of the credit to Thomas 
Arnold of Rugby. As in the case of many other great 
reputations, a reaction followed; and to-day it has become 
fashionable to speak of the “Arnold myth.” The discussion 
has not been free from bias. Alumni of great schools which 
can boast their own famous headmasters can be pardoned 
for seeking to revise a version of history which ignores 
their names. But the pure question of fact is capable of 
objective historical determination. The question of pure 
fact is how far the existence of Arnold brought about the 
reforms. It is when we ask how much credit is to be given 
to Arnold for what he did, how much greater:a man (if 
at all) was he than other contemporary headmasters, how 
far he was merely a product of his times, whether if he 
had not done what he did someone else would not have 
done it, that we enter on a sphere where conjecture is 
hardly capable of proof or of disproof. 
It is necessary in the first place to set out clearly the 
reforms which are admitted to have taken place. The moral 
tone of the schools was vastly improved; discipline was 
changed, largely by a new bias given to the prefect system; 
the curriculum was somewhat widened by making French 
and mathematics regular subjects instead of “extras”; 
teaching became more efficient and industry more common; 
an improvement took place in diet and housing; ‘‘dames,” 
where they existed, were replaced by house-masters; and 
the school chapel became a ‘powerful influence. In conse- 
quence of these internal changes public confidence was 
restored; the middle class was attracted to the public 
schools; a number of new schools were set up on the same 
lines; some of the old grammar schools became indis- 
tinguishable from the original seven; nonconformists came

to approve of the clerical headmaster; and the rise of a 
“religious difficulty,’ such as that which has done so 
much to hinder the progress of elementary education, was 
obviated. 
Next it may be noticed that these changes differ con- 
siderably in the extent to which they require a strong 
personality for their attainment. Changes in curriculum, 
diet, housing, and the position of assistant masters are 
matters of organisation which can be effected by com- 
mittees or by headmasters of ordinary capacity, if only 
public opinion demands them. Improvements in teaching 
are more dependent on the human factor; but they call, 
not for a few outstanding personalities, but for an adequate 
supply of well educated teachers, such as were sure to 
become available so soon as the universities began to take 
their duties seriously. But a sweeping reform of moral 
tone required individuality of a high order; and it is to 
the changes which took place in this sphere, the changes 
which did more than anything else to conciliate public 
opinion, that Arnold’s admirers look for their main proofs 
of his influence. None of these reforms can, however, be 
overlooked; for they all represent a change of opinion in 
the nation at large, to which the public schools responded. 
The roughness of the material provision for schoolboys 
was a mediaeval tradition dating from the old monastic 
days when the mortification of the flesh, whether voluntary 
or compulsory, was regarded as a means of purifying the 
spirit. Pecuniary motives of course entered; in the days 
of the Renaissance, Erasmus and Vives hint that to starve 
your pupils was the quickest road to fortune in the scholas- 
tic profession. Then too Locke’s hardening theory reflected 
a widespread belief, which seemed to give educational 
sanction to the dictates of economy. But, above all, no 
one before Thring realised the inevitable effect of external 
conditions on character. Dr Johnson once remarked that, 
because a man happened to be born in a stable, he was 
not therefore a horse; but it is equally true that, if a boy 
be brought up in a pig-sty, he will tend to become a pig. 
However, the Platonic view that beautiful surroundings

implant in the soul an unconscious love of beauty, which 
later in life will develop into a conscious striving after the 
ideal, had no meaning for the early Victorians. Their ideas 
on such matters savoured of Sparta rather than of Athens. 
It is from the seventies that most housing legislation dates ; 
the early Victorian placed his workpeople in slums and 
his own children in bare class-rooms and uncomfortable 
boarding-houses. Glaring evils, however, began to be 
remedied. At Rugby, in the interests of work, James gave 
the boys separate studies, and Butler followed his example 
at Shrewsbury!. At Eton the headmastership of Hawtrey 
(1834-1852) saw sweeping changes. But, even in 1838 
“a deputation which waited upon the authorities with 
a request that a supply of water might be laid on in College 
was dismissed with the rebuff:—‘ You will be wanting gas 
and turkey carpets next®’”; and, a few years earlier, a 
suggestion of including potatoes in the dietary evoked from 
one of the fellows the enquiry, “But who is to peel the 
potatoes?” Only in 1846 were a heating system and a 
water supply introduced, and tea and breakfast provided. 
At the same time the boys were given small separate rooms; 
suitable furniture was provided; sick rooms and lavatories 
were built; and a “proper staff of servants was engaged 
to do all menial work under the supervision of a resident 
matron*.’’ Complaints as to food were a frequent cause 
for school mutinies. The Public Schools Commission com- 
pleted the sweeping away of the old barrack life in the 
seven schools; but it was left for Thring to raise the matter 
to a higher plane by proclaiming the effect of the “al- 
mighty wall” on character. Arnold was brought into little 
connection with these troubles; however, he superseded 
the Rugby “dames” by house-masters, a change which 
was going on elsewhere. At Eton Lyte puts its beginning 
about 1824, but it was not completely effected till fifty years 
later®. Governors would naturally favour the change as

giving masters an income independent of that derived from 
the school funds; but it was only the changed attitude of 
masters which made it an advantage; it might easily have 
become an incentive to profiteering. 
Changes in curriculum before the Royal Commission 
were slight. Arnold made French and mathematics regular 
subjects instead of “extras” for which special fees were 
charged; but James had been extremely fond of teaching 
mathematics, and Butler, following him, had included it 
as a regular part of the Shrewsbury studies. It was only 
in 1851 that Eton! elevated the senior mathematical 
master, Stephen Hawtrey, a relative of the head, to the 
full status of an assistant master, and his six assistants 
remained in a subordinate position till the Commission. 
They were in fact the lineal successors of the visiting teacher 
of writing and arithmetic, usually a scrivener’s clerk, who 
in the seventeenth century had been allowed to teach the 
boys out of school hours. So persistent were archaic sur- 
vivals that, even at a time when Cambridge, with one of 
whose colleges—King’s—Eton was most closely connected, 
reserved its highest honours for mathematicians, mathe- 
matical masters were neither allowed to wear gowns nor 
to take a share in the general discipline of the school, 
received lower salaries and could not become house- 
masters! The attitude of headmasters towards mathe- 
matics is illustrated by a story of an interview between a 
newly-appointed mathematical master and his chief. The 
assistant’s attempts to extract from the head any expres- 
sions of opinion on the mathematical syllabus were cut 
short by the brief answer, “That’s as you please”; and, 
when he went on to make enquiries as to his status and 
disciplinary powers, as for instance whether the boys 
would be expected to cap him, he received the equally 
curt reply, ‘““That’s as they please.” The attitude of all 
headmasters, however, was not like this; Charles Butler 
of Harrow (1805-1829), for instance, was himself a wrangler, 
and made a little mathematics compulsory, and French 
soon followed. French was everywhere taught like a dead

language; indeed Arnold insisted in the interests of dis- 
cipline that it should not be taught by foreigners but by 
the ordinary form master, and up to very recent times 
experience has justified his view. We have seen that history 
was taught for one hour a week during one term in the 
year at Eton, Rugby, and Shrewsbury, and that some 
geography, chiefly ancient, was taught at Eton. The Eton 
Atlas of those days had modern maps opposite the ancient 
maps; but countries which lay outside the Graeco-Roman 
world, such as Scotland, Ireland, and Russia, were un- 
represented. Arnold wrote: ‘Although some provision is 
undoubtedly made at Rugby for acquiring a knowledge 
of modern history, yet the history of Rome and Greece 
is more studied than that of France and England”; and 
he defended the procedure on the ground that ancient 
history could be studied from original authorities who were 
at the same time first-rate historians and in the front rank 
of literature, which is not the case with modern history. 
Arnold was a historian, and the historical bias which he 
gave to classical studies is perhaps the most noteworthy 
feature of his curriculum; in other schools ancient history 
was almost as completely ignored as modern. Non-classical 
subjects in fact made less progress in the older schools than 
in newer schools like Cheltenham; and it was only after 
the Royal Commission that they began to receive serious 
attention. We must not, however, forget that most of the 
intellectual stimulus of Eton was supplied not by the class 
teaching, but by the tutorial system; and that tutors often 
induced their pupils to do an amount of serious general 
reading in history and in English, and even in foreign, 
literature which might sometimes astonish our examination- 
ridden generation. 
We next turn to improvements in teaching, which were 
very general. Butler of Shrewsbury (1793-1836) stands out 
at the head of the reformers. The school had sadly declined 
from its former high estate; and in 1798 an Act of Parlia- 
ment was passed to reform the statutes and, in particular, 
to abolish the provision that the headmaster must be a 
burgess of Shrewsbury and an old Salopian. Butler was

the first head appointed under the new scheme, and 
entered on his duties at the early age of twenty-four. He 
was one of the foremost scholars of his time and an excellent 
organiser. His system of periodical examinations and pro- 
motion by merit rather than by seniority was hailed as a 
striking novelty. His great triumph came when Kennedy, 
while still a pupil of the school and only a scholar-elect of 
Trinity, won the Porson Prize. Butler’s improvements in 
method consisted largely in diminishing the old “ grammar 
grind.” For generations it had not been considered enough 
that boys should understand and apply the rules of syntax; 
they must learn them by heart in the exact Latin words of 
the text-book. Even in sixth forms every word of the 
author was parsed and the rule for its construction given 
in Latin’. If the reader wishes to realise the procedure, 
let him read examples from a famous schoolmaster of the 
seventeenth century, Richard Brinsley?. It was not 
enough that boys should learn the declensions and con- 
jugations; they must also know by heart rules, of course 
written in Latin, which were supposed to teach how to form 
the various cases or tenses, though in reality the rule was 
unintelligible save by reference to the forms themselves! 
Greek grammar, in particular, was a labyrinth of technical 
terms, of separate conjugations and declensions which had 
no real existence, and of endless complications of which the 
modern schoolboy has never heard. Correct Attic was at 
a discount, and forms were gathered indiscriminately from 
every dialect. Butler and his successor Kennedy (1836— 
1866), being at once first-rate scholars and first-rate 
teachers, could see what was needed and could supply it; 
and in the course of fifty years intelligible grammars 
resulted. Butler’s old pupils carried his methods to other 
schools. But, entirely apart from Butler’s influence, a new 
type of assistant master was arising; we all know Tom 
Brown’s “ young master®””—Cotton—who “seemed to have 
1 I have been assured by Mr Oscar Browning that the parsing of 
every word survived up to his own day at Eton.

the bad taste to be really interested in the lesson and to be 
trying to work them into something like appreciation of 
it, giving them good spirited English words, instead of the 
wretched bald stuff into which they rendered poor old 
Homer; and construing over each piece himself to them 
after each boy, to show them how it should be done.” 
Maxwell Lyte gives two passages! supplied to him by a 
correspondent whose name he does not quote, which give 
a detailed description of classical teaching at Eton, first 
under Keate and then under Hawtrey. Keate was for his 
time an excellent scholar, but he attempted the impossible 
task of teaching 120 boys at once—the whole of the sixth 
and fifth forms. Hawtrey introduced organisation; he 
withdrew with the thirty top boys into the library, aban- 
doned the idea of personally supervising a number of 
assistants teaching in the same room, divided the rest of 
the school into a number of parallel forms of manageable 
size, gave to each a form master for the whole of its work, 
and, having carefully selected his men, left them a large 
amount of liberty. The result was that, though he was 
himself a believer in the older methods, the younger 
assistants introduced Butler’s reforms. At first this pro- 
duced a chaos of older and newer methods, but in the long 
run the new methods triumphed. 
One sign of the increasing intellectual energy of the 
schools is to be found in the magazines which began to 
appear. That of Harrow began in the last year of Charles 
‘Butler’s headmastership; A. H. Clough had much to do 
with one at Rugby; while several short-lived attempts 
were made at Eton, some of a higher literary quality than 
are usually to be found at the present day. 
In spite of improvements, the seven public schools, with 
the exception of Eton and Rugby, were never lower in 
public favour than in the thirties and forties. Moberley 
(1835-1866) was by no means the least of Winchester’s 
masters, but by 1855 the number of commoners had fallen 
to 68. Harrow dropped to 127 under Charles Butler and 
to 69 under Wordsworth (1835-1844). Charterhouse stood

at 104 in 1832 and had only risen to razr in 1863. West- 
minster, which in 1818 had numbered 324, fell to 100 in 
1835 and below 80 in 1841. Even Shrewsbury under 
Kennedy only numbered 133 in 1841 and scarcely rose 
for twenty years. The persistence of bad housing arrange- 
ments at Shrewsbury and the reputation of Winchester 
for hardship and bullying have been put forward as 
reasons. 
We now reach the vital question of school tone. It may 
be well to approach causes by way of symptoms. The most 
astonishing of these symptoms to modern times is the 
constant recrudescence of mutinies and lock-outs. At 
Winchester there were several mutinies between 1775 and 
1793, the most serious arising from a refusal to let the 
boys attend a performance by a military band in the Close. 
For two days the boys held the College buildings under the 
red flag, and the episode was terminated only by numerous 
expulsions. Goddard had some insight into the use of 
self-government as a corrective; but things went back 
under his successor, and in 1818 a rising was put down by 
two companies of soldiers with fixed bayonets. At Rugby 
in 1797, the headmaster having ordered the boys to pay 
for damages done to a tradesman against whom they had 
a. grievance, they blew up the door of the head’s study and 
made a bonfire of his books and the school desks. On the 
appearance of a body of special constables and the reading 
of the Riot Act, they retired to an island in “the Lake”; 
again soldiers were called in, and the island was taken by 
assault. George III’s standing question when he met Eton 
boys was, “Have you had a rebellion lately, eh, eh?” 
Keate was as powerful in suppressing rebellions as he was 
powerless to produce an administration which would 
remove the rebellious spirit. Most modern headmasters 
would think it time to resign when rotten eggs had flown 
round them on several occasions. Not so Keate; each time 
he saw it through, and half a dozen expulsions and forty 
or fifty floggings testified to his triumph. After one occa- 
sion when he was so occupied from lock-up on Saturday 
night to the early hours of Sunday morning, he reigned in 
   
-P-A-G-E-75
  
  1] THE REVIVAL IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 61 
peace. Even Butler of Shrewsbury had his windows broken 
and put a stop to insubordination only by three expulsions. 
The last serious rebellion was at Marlborough in 1851. 
This chronicle of mutinies is but the most striking evi- 
dence that discipline, as now understood, was non-existent 
a hundred years ago. Assistant masters were only just 
beginning to be expected to help the head in discipline 
outside their own class-rooms. James at Rugby was often 
warned of impending disorder by notes thrown in at his 
window, though he was one of the first headmasters to 
think it unfair to expect boys to give information against 
their schoolfellows?. 
Unfortunately these external disorders were indicative 
of worse evils which rarely came to the knowledge of the 
staff. Readers of these pages will hardly need to be told 
of these. For every one person who is acquainted with 
most of the sources of information on the schools of this 
period, a hundred know Tom Brown’s Schooldays. The salt 
water, tossing in a blanket, and roasting; the drinking, 
gambling, and loose talk; the profanity which was much 
more than a mere mannerism, are all familiar. Tom Brown’s 
Rugby was bad enough; the record of Long Chamber at 
Eton throws a more ghastly light still on what was prob- 
ably common. ‘Parents who wished to avoid the worst 
evils of Long Chamber and yet secure the advantage of 
the scholarships entered their boys as oppidans and allowed 
them to remain such until the extreme limit of age was 
reached at which they could enter upon the foundation” 
of Eton and so of King’s afterwards?. ‘‘Cruel at times the 
suffering and wrong; wild the profligacy. For after eight 
o'clock at night no prying eye came near till the following 
morning; no one lived in the same building; cries of joy 
and pain were equally unheard; and, excepting a code of 
laws of their own, there was no help or redress for any 
one®.”’ Thring is here writing from his own memories. 
Before asking how these evils have been remedied, it is

necessary to ask whether they really have been remedied. 
We may ignore the class of croakers who believed that a 
Spartan discipline was an actual benefit to character. The 
war has surely exploded them and their theories for ever. 
The British boy, from whatever class he come, who was 
held by these /audatores temporis acti to have been “‘spoilt” 
by comfort, has shown that he can undergo a physical and 
nervous ordeal to which no previous generation since the 
age of the early martyrs had been subjected without a 
thought of drawing back unless or until he had “seen it 
through.” The doctrine of Thring (and of Plato) is 
“justified of her children.” But it is a more plausible 
contention that only the material side has improved, that 
bullying and misery have ceased, but that the true moral 
tone is no better. The life of an oriental slave gang, it may 
be argued, has been exchanged for the luxury of Imperial 
Rome; vice has become attractive instead of abhorrent; 
public schools are not more virtuous but only more civilised. 
A true answer would probably be somewhat as follows. 
There are now about a hundred schools, great and small, 
conducted “‘on public school lines,” whereas there were 
formerly but seven. At any given time there will be a few 
of these in which the worst influences are at work. Gam- 
bling tends to appear more often than of old in a few of the 
wealthiest; occasionally drinking becomes prevalent, but 
less than in the old days. As long as we think only of 
positive vices we may be tempted to take too gloomy a 
view. But, if we think of the good that there is in these 
hundred schools and compare it with the amount which 
could be found a hundred years ago, our pessimism 
vanishes. Far more boys, when they reach the university 
and are free to order their own life, order it on lines of 
which their headmasters would approve. The improve- 
ment may have been mainly in mid-Victorian days; there 
may have been even a retrogression in the wealthier schools 
in more recent years; but the gain, on the whole, stands. 
We have now to consider how it was achieved. 
Organisation undoubtedly played some part. Separate 
studies, smaller dormitories, supervision, removal of

grievances, and other points which have been already 
noted did much to suppress the influence of the worst boys, 
and to develop a cheerful outlook which is itself of great 
help to the promotion of a healthy mind. Men and boys 
who are well-treated themselves are more likely to be 
considerate for others; the brutal soldiery who ravaged 
Belgium were themselves the product of brutal treatment. 
Cruelty means selfishness; and selfishness is the ally of 
sensuality. 
But organisation has its limitations. Good policing and 
good opportunities give the decent boy a chance. Most 
boys have generous instincts, healthy tastes, and even a 
desire to use their mental powers, though not always on 
the subjects which their teachers desire. But there is in 
every boy a relic of the ape and tiger, and of the savage. 
In a good home the good is brought out and the bad is 
atrophied by disuse. Thus each new generation rises to the 
level which its predecessor has attained. But “a society 
formed exclusively of boys, that is, of elements each 
separately weak and imperfect, becomes more than an 
aggregate of their separate defects; the amount of evil in 
the mass is more than the sum of the evil in the individuals ; 
it is aggravated in its character, while the amount of good, 
on the contrary, is less in the mass than in the individuals, 
and its effect greatly weakened?.’”’ Personal influence is 
therefore needed in a school to take the place of parental 
influence at home. 
This personal influence is exercised both by the head- 
master and his assistants. It was not till long after Arnold’s 
time that the present friendly relations between boys and 
masters became common. We get just a trace of it at the 
end of Tom Brown, in the conversation between Tom and 
the new master; but Cotton was no ordinary assistant 
master. Mr Rowbothom, in his History of Rossall?, tells 
us that ‘‘with a few single exceptions the natural enemy” 
theory” between masters and boys held the field till the

headmastership of H. A. James (1875-1886). Edward 
Bowen, who took a post at Harrow in the sixties, lamented 
that the master had nothing to do with the boys', though 
he himself became a typical example of the changed rela- 
tions. Almond of Loretto, who managed his school almost 
like a family, was regarded as an eccentric (1862). But, 
even if masters had not yet learned to mix with boys on 
easy terms out of school and if boys still looked on their 
masters as distant gods on Olympus, masters began to 
be really intent on boys’ well-being, and boys replied with 
admiration, though not yet with affection. The new type 
of master likewise stimulated intellectual activity; and 
intellectual activity reacts on character. To quote Arnold 
once more, ‘‘Experience has led me more and more to 
believe in this connexion, for which divers reasons may be 
given. One, and a very important one, is that ability puts 
a boy in sympathy with his teachers in the matter of 
his work and im their delight in the works of master minds; 
whereas a dull boy has much more sympathy with the 
uneducated, and others to whom animal enjoyment is all 
in all?.” 
When once good traditions have been established, the 
influence of men of ordinary sound common-sense and 
character is sufficient to maintain them. Schoolboys’ in- 
tense conservatism makes them, like certain States men- 
tioned by Macchiavelli, hard to win but easy to hold when 
won. But the first establishment of good traditions needed 
men of that inexplicable power of winning over opposition 
which is very rare, coupled with the tact which gains 
positions by working round them when they seem to 
present insuperable difficulties to direct assault. Almond 
of Loretto and Thring of Uppingham, who both built up 
schools almost out of nothing, had an easy task compared 
with the headmasters of the thirties, who had to pierce 
through a barbed wire entanglement of hostile traditions. 
Such work could only be accomplished by the headmaster, 
since a particular tone penetrates the whole school; and

the headmaster, in virtue of his position, finds it harder 
to bridge the gap between himself and the boys than 
do his assistants. These considerations may explain why 
the headmasters who are credited with producing most 
improvement in the moral tone of their schools were men 
rather of forceful and dominating than of winning and 
lovable personalities. 
The school chapel gave these powerful characters an 
opportunity for direct assault. Dean Stanley and the 
author of Tom Brown both represent it as a scene of 
Arnold’s triumphs. The chapel was there before; but 
Arnold was the first headmaster of Rugby to get himself 
appointed chaplain: this was essential to his conception of 
the pastoral relation in which a headmaster should stand 
to his pupils. In the next generation a school chapel came 
to be considered as an essential feature of a boarding- 
school; but it was not so earlier. Charles Butler had no 
chapel at Harrow and probably never preached a sermon 
to his boys. Though a chapel existed at Shrewsbury, the 
governors insisted, against Samuel Butler’s wishes, that 
the boys should attend the parish church on Sunday 
mornings, in order that any one-sidedness in his preaching 
might be counteracted by the sermons of the parochial 
clergy. Most headmasters of the period agreed with 
Arnold, but the influence which they exercised from the 
pulpit of course differed enormously. 
The chapel was the only place where, on ordinary 
occasions, the headmaster was brought into direct touch 
with his school as a whole. Otherwise his immediate 
influence was brought to bear almost exclusively in the 
class-room, and on the sixth form only. But the right 
treatment of a sixth form was discovered earlier than that 
of the middle parts of the school. The reason is easily seen. 
We commonly speak of sixth form ‘“‘boys”; but these 
“boys” are intellectually men, and at other ages of the 
world would have been so considered. While the art of 
understanding boys was still to be learned, a headmaster 
had only to treat his sixth “as gentlemen,” to apply, that

is, to them canons of behaviour with which he was well 
acquainted outside the class-room walls, and the way was 
clear to bring to bear on them whatever influence as man 
to man he possessed. Boys would be kept aloof by the 
very dress of a headmaster who, till Temple (headmaster 
of Rugby, 1858—18¢9) set them the example, never doffed 
their clerical robes; but young men could tell a man 
beneath the uniform. It is curious how this simple plan 
of behaving inside the sixth form room as they did outside 
was discovered simultaneously by a number of headmasters 
who had no model to follow. Hawtrey, Arnold, Moberley, 
and Charles Butler none of them ever saw any of the others 
teaching; yet the contrast which Lyte’s correspondent 
draws' between Hawtrey and Keate would not be in- 
appropriate to any of the four. ‘“‘Hawtrey may be said 
to have done by encouraging what Keate tried to do by 
threatening. If there is any truth in that melancholy 
caricature by which Keate is known to most men, if his 
battle-cry really was ‘I’ll flog you,’ it is no less true that 
Hawtrey’s characteristic utterance was, ‘Very well, very 
good exercise,’ said with a gracious emphasis which never 
lost its charm. Men have almost grown old who still feel 
thankful that they once lived with a man who, though 
quite at home in the most brilliant circles, did as truly as 
Lacordaire ‘love young people.’” Or contrast these two 
passages: ‘‘Keate had as lower master acquired a rooted 
distrust in the honour of boys in general, and he used to 
make point blank charges quite at random....The effect 
of this was to encourage the very evil which he wished to 
check®.” “There grew up a general feeling that ‘it was a 
shame to tell Arnold a lie—he always believes you’.’” 
As headmasters had the opportunity and the power of 
influencing directly only their young men of the sixth form, 
we see the importance of that bias given to the prefect 
system by which it was made the vehicle for transferring 
the headmaster’s influence to the rest of the school. The 
sixth form, still sufficiently fresh from boyhood not to have

« forgotten the nature of boys, with no ‘‘natural enemy” 
tradition to break down, mixing freely with the boys, and 
regarded by the boys as the élite of their own number, 
could do what the masters did not yet know how to do, 
and had a hundred-fold more opportunities to do it. No 
one believes that Arnold invented prefects. They had 
descended from the early grammar-schools where the 
monitors were used to eke out the resources of a staff con- 
sisting of the headmaster and an usher. In the old days 
they marked attendances, heard accidence, inspected 
tidiness, and exercised some sort of supervision in church, 
at meals, and out of school: in fact we may call them the 
non-commissioned officers of the school. Their teaching 
functions seem to have vanished with the provision of a 
more adequate staff, and only one effort was made to 
revive them. The result was an interesting interlude which, 
however, exercised no influence on the subsequent develop- 
ment of education. At the time when the monitorial 
system of Bell and Lancaster was believed to be a panacea 
for all the difficulties in elementary education, Russell 
(x818-1832) introduced it at Charterhouse, taking the 
120 top boys himself for part of the time, while they taught 
the lower forms for the rest. So great was public confidence 
in the monitorial system that the numbers rapidly rose 
from 233 to 480 in seven years. Even then he had only 
eight masters. But experience soon condemned the system ; 
the numbers fell back to 103, and Russell resigned. Seeing 
that Russell’s monitors were of the same age as the later 
pupil teachers, the experiment cannot be considered as 
intrinsically unpromising, in spite of its failure. 
This incident is strong evidence of the fluid character 
of educational institutions at this period. Russell overlaps 
Arnold. Arnold’s modification of the prefect system was 
superficially small compared with Russell’s. Prefects al- 
ready supervised, reported, and punished in every public 
school. In the same sense the functions of king, lords, and 
commons are the same now as they were in the reign of 
Queen Anne. But James’s lament that his house was the 
hardest to manage because it contained the largest pro-

portion of older boys shows the change in working. So does 
Keate’s action in flogging his whole sixth form in front 
of the assembled juniors, who viewed the performance 
much as we might imagine a Prussian battalion watching 
its N.C.O.’s sent to the guardroom in a body. What kind 
of influence could Keate imagine his prefects would possess 
after this? 
Tradition credits Arnold with setting the example of 
the way in which prefects became the means of transmitting 
the headmaster’s influence. A vague hazy public impres- 
sion may assign to him all the reforms which occurred in 
public schools during half-a-century: in this sense there 
truly is an “Arnold myth.” But for this myth Stanley 
and Tom Hughes are not responsible. They make this 
one definite claim; and Arnold himself defends his use of 
the prefect system exactly as we should expect its acknow- 
ledged author to defend it. Can the claim be brought to 
the definite test of evidence? We think it can. The change 
is not one of those reforms, like improved scholarship or 
greater keenness or greater urbanity, which are natural 
outcomes of the spirit of the age. It was a discovery— 
a very simple discovery it appears, like Columbus’s treat- 
ment of the egg; but no one discovered it before, and 
everyone used'it afterwards. These are the two propositions 
which need to be proved. 
Fortunately the number of public schools was so small 
that the first proposition can be proved by the process 
of direct enumeration. The only shadow of a counter-claim 
is that made by Leach for Winchester. Arnold himself, 
in a spirit common amongst English, and especially among 
Whig, reformers, seeks to base his reform on the traditions 
of the past, and to minimise the change. He contends that 
the prefect system was in existence at Winchester when he 
was a pupil there under Goddard. If so, the tradition had 
been completely forgotten at Winchester, so far as the 
real Arnoldian spirit of the institution was concerned; for, 
after Goddard’s time, came a period when rowdyism 
reached its height, and Leach himself admits that Win-

chester had a peculiar reputation for bullying throughout 
the reign of Arnold’s contemporary Moberley (1835-1866). 
The impression which Moberley leaves is that of a humane 
and scholarly man, fearfully Victorian in decorum, too 
clerical to be understood by boys or young men and too 
sedate to understand them, and too conventional to be 
an originator’. Keate’s flogging exploit shows how com- 
pletely absent the spirit of Arnold’s prefect system was 
at Eton; and Hawtrey’s reforms were those of an efficient 
administrator rather than of a leader of men. Charter- 
house tried to modify the prefect system on quite different 
lines. Butler of Shrewsbury had on one occasion expelled 
all his prepostors, though he subsequently took them back; 
and Kennedy, though an excellent teacher, was too im- 
pulsive and violent in temper to exercise a steady influence. 
Westminster was undergoing a period of eclipse. At 
Harrow Goldwin Smith described the form of government 
as ‘“‘moderate anarchy”; and C. S. Roundell definitely 
asserts’ that the Harrow sixth consciously attempted to 
follow Arnold’s lines, as depicted in Stanley’s Life (pub- 
lished 1844), under the guidance of Charles James Vaughan, 
one of Arnold’s pupils, who transformed the school between 
1845 and 1859. 
Vaughan’s reform of Harrow brings us from the proof of 
the negative proposition that the Arnoldian working of 
the prefect system is found missing in every one of the 
seven schools before his time to the positive proposition 
that its spread was directly due to his influence. Vaughan 
found Harrow with 69 boys and, when he resigned because 
he held that a headmaster had contributed all the ideas 
he had to give to a school in fourteen years, he left it with 
469. Harrow was the only school of the old seven which 
was revived by one of Arnold’s disciples; but, when we 
remember that, with the exception of Eton, the other 
public schools sank during the Arnoldian epoch to the

position now occupied by the smallest members of the 
Headmasters’ Conference, we see that the evidence of 
Arnold’s influence has to be sought rather in the new 
schools which were rapidly founded on public school lines 
than in the ranks of the sevent. 
Three of these schools were founded during the forties. 
Cheltenham, the earliest, was a definite attempt to found 
a new type of school. Marlborough aimed at providing 
an education less costly than that of the public schools 
for sons of parish clergymen, but without any specific views 
as to the type of government which should prevail. Rossall 
had somewhat similar aims, but the first headmaster was 
a fervid Arnoldian with more faith than discretion, whose 
ideas almost anticipated the modern American experiments 
in self-governing communities. Yet in twenty years all 
came to be of the uniform public school type, as it is now 
understood. Marlborough led the way; its happy-go-lucky 
system of the first decade broke down the most completely ; 
and it was deliberately reformed on Arnoldian lines by 
Arnold’s own disciple Cotton: at Rossall subsequent head- 
masters cut down the powers of the prefects within Arnold’s 
limits: and Cheltenham, under Barry, abandoned its 
alternative experiment, which had proved unworkable. 
It is, we believe, its very universality and its success in 
driving out all rivals which have made the Arnoldian system 
appear to many to be so obvious a development as to have 
needed no master mind for its origination. The decade 
before its acceptance should dispel this feeling of in- 
evitableness. When Cheltenham was founded by zealous 
Evangelicals, Evangelicals had not yet reconciled them- 
selves to the public school system. It was primarily a 
day school. But its chief peculiarity was that the head- 
master was responsible only for his pupils’ intellects; their 
conduct was supervised by a committee, which dealt with 
schoolboy offences like a board of magistrates. A third 
difference, the existence of a Military and Civil Service 
side, to which Woolwich and Sandhurst stand in the same

relation as do Oxford and Cambridge to the classical side, 
became the parent of all modern sides, though most of 
them fell short of their model and became mere dumping- 
grounds for the inefficient. The continuance of day-boys at 
Cheltenham—in this respect imitated by Clifton—and the 
general adoption of modern sides, show that the peculiar 
disciplinary system was not swamped by a mere desire 
for assimilation. The reputation of Cheltenham under 
Dobson (1845-1859) stood high; its practice is often 
quoted by the Public School Commissioners on doubtful 
points in connection with the intellectual régime of the 
schools which were within their purview. Dobson was a 
fine teacher and organiser of teaching; probably more 
intellectual work was done than at the public schools. There 
was never, as at Marlborough, a danger of a collapse. The 
disciplinary system merely gave way to the rival system 
because the latter was seen to be successful elsewhere 
while the former proved to be simply unworkable. The 
failure of a rival system at a school which in many ways 
was a pioneer brings into relief the success of Arnold’s 
system as it was consciously transplanted to Marlborough 
by Cotton. 
Marlborough was founded by local enterprise, aided by 
a host of prominent supporters, especially to afford educa- 
tion to sons of the clergy. The advent of the railway had 
ruined coaching; and a historic mansion, which for many 
years had served as a coaching hostelry, was secured as 
a home for the new school. The appearance of two hundred 
boys proved that it met an effective demand. Most of 
them were under sixteen; some came from home, some 
from private schools, some from local grammar schools. 
It was thus an illuminating experiment. It was free from 
traditions, good or bad. All that was brought was boy 
nature. The masters could feel that they had a free hand 
to suit their system to their material; if they failed, they 
could not blame preceding generations; if they succeeded, 
the credit was their own. Fame did her best for the new 
enterprise; within a short time the numbers stood at five 
hundred. But the first builders did not erect a lasting

  72 THE REVIVAL IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS [cu. 
structure. Something was amiss. The boys exhibited the 
sporting instincts of all English country lads: their poaching 
exploits threw the feats of Tom Brown’s schoolfellows into 
the shade. ‘‘The general feeling between the masters and 
the boys was one of distrust and enmity1.’”’ The school 
got out of hand; in 1851 there was a rebellion of the same 
type as had occurred so often in the older schools. The 
headmaster knew that the boys had ground for their 
complaints; he compromised; ‘things were patched up for 
the moment; the mutiny broke out again; books were 
burned ; boys were expelled; finally the headmaster resigned. 
The first stage in the experiment was completed, and the 
result could be written up. The old Jaissez-faire methods 
of public schools were a failure, not through bad traditions, 
but through an inherent defect of their own. They had 
been tried on new material, and had produced the old 
results. 
Here was an opportunity for a crucial experiment on 
the part of Arnold’s disciples. The governors elected Cotton, 
the ‘‘young master” of Tom Brown. He made the prefect 
system a reality. A crusade was proclaimed on drinking 
and breaking bounds. The prefects spent most of their 
half-holidays in “drawing” public-houses. There was 
opposition. Cotton assembled the school and addressed 
them thus: ‘‘ The Council informed me on my appointment 
that the school was in a bad state of discipline, and they 
hoped that I would allow no boy to go out except in pairs 
under a master. I told them I could not accept office on 
such terms, that the school I hoped to govern was a public: 
school, not a private one, and I would try to govern it by 
means of prefects. The school knows now how matters 
stand. They must either submit to the prefects or be 
reduced to the level of a private school and have their 
freedom ignominiously curtailed. The prefects are and 
shall be, as long as I am head, the governors of the school. 
As soon as I see that this is impracticable, I shall resign?.”’

  im] THE REVIVAL IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 73 
Cotton was victorious. He and his assistants wisely saw 
that some outlet for the boys’ physical energies was neces- 
sary, and they wrote circulars to the parents in support of 
games. Football had for some time been the chief winter 
pastime in public schools; but Marlborough had much to 
do with making it a regular institution. Cotton and many 
of his staff came from Rugby; hence the Rugby variety 
of the game was introduced. Old Marlburians were re- 
sponsible even more than old Rugbeians for creating 
university Rugby football. From the universities it spread 
to the nation. Well may we wonder what the devoted 
bishop of Calcutta, if he could revisit this earth on a 
Saturday afternoon, would think of the later developments 
of his device for preventing Marlborough boys from 
poaching. Critics of Arnold sometimes hold him respon- 
sible for the subordination of work to games in public 
schools. Arnold’s whole direct contribution was that he 
sometimes stood on the touch-line and looked pleased. 
Indirectly he dammed various undesirable outlets for 
boys’ vitality, which in consequence flowed the more 
vigorously within permitted channels. Cotton saw how 
games had proved a counter-attraction and deliberately 
encouraged them. He can scarcely be blamed because 
others have carried them to excess. Nor was he a Pro- 
metheus who slipped a dose of animal spirits into little 
men and produced the race of boys, as any reader of 
accounts of school life in the thirties and forties will admit. 
It is less easy to say when Marlborough masters ceased to 
be the “natural enemies” of their pupils; but it is not an 
unlikely hypothesis that games contributed to this result. 
Cotton was succeeded by another Rugbeian, Bradley (1858— 
1870), and for a time it won a pre-eminence in scholarship 
and sport almost without a parallel. Arnold’s system had 
been justified by one at least of her children. 
Rossall brings to our notice an over-development of 
Arnold’s system. Woolley, the first headmaster, had been 
a great friend of A. P. Stanley at Oxford, had been greatly 
impressed by his account of Arnold’s work, and doubtless 
believed that he was copying its main feature. He had 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 THE REVIVAL IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS [cx. 
not, however, seen the system at work, and the turn which 
he gave to it overstrained its possibilities. His prefects 
practically ruled; he was little more than a constitutional 
monarch. His successor Osborne (1849-1870) was sur- 
prised to discover that, when his prefects ‘‘advised” him 
to give a half-holiday, he was.expected to take their advice 
as that of a cabinet. He at once pruned down the system 
within Rugby limits, though there is no evidence of any 
direct contact with Arnold or his disciples. When the 
monitors tendered their resignation, he merely remarked, 
“Gentlemen, you are monitors and will continue to be 
monitors.” An exaggerated imitation is distinct evidence 
that Arnold’s contemporaries recognised that he had added 
something individual to the previously prevailing practice. 
It may be significant that the “natural enemy theory” is 
recorded to have come to an end under James, because 
James came from Marlborough, and Marlborough was 
made by Cotton, the very man in whose favour Tom 
Brown relaxed the theory! 
Space forbids a detailed account of the rise of subsequent 
new schools; but Arnold’s spiritual descendants were 
carrying his system everywhere. Wellington won its 
position under Benson (1859-1868), a pupil of Prince Lee, 
one of Arnold’s masters, at Birmingham, and himself a 
master at Rugby; Haileybury under A. G. Butler (1861— 
1867), a pupil at Rugby under Tait and a master under 
Temple; Clifton under Percival (1862-1878), another Rugby 
master. Of the older schools which developed on the same 
lines, Repton owes its position to Pears (1854-1874), a 
house-master at Harrow under Vaughan, who raised the 
numbers from fifty to 250. Malvern was founded ‘‘on the 
system of Winchester,’ which we take to be the first 
attempt, while adopting Arnold’s system, to dissociate it 
from Rugby. It is interesting in this connection to notice 
which schools play Rugby and which Association football. 
If a school plays Rugby, it is almost always possible to 
prove that it consciously followed Arnold’s traditions and 
acknowledged it; such is the case with the majority of 
great schools outside the seven. The converse is not so

universal; Repton, for instance, plays Association because 
the Rugby influence came by way of Harrow. As time went 
on, there was a tendency, especially in the case of High 
Church schools, which could not forget Arnold’s theological 
views, to look to Winchester as the fountain of the system!. 
Was not Winchester the oldest of our public schools? Did 
not Arnold, in his defence of the prefect system, sign him- 
self ‘A Wykehamist”? The mediaeval associations ap- 
pealed to the High Church clergy, who were fast becoming 
the prevailing party; and perhaps it was well, in the 
interests of the system, that they should believe that it 
was under Arnold exactly what it had been in the days of 
William of Wykeham. Undoubtedly the schools with a 
High Church bias tended to get their masters from Win- 
chester, where Moberley was supposed to have suffered 
in loss of numbers from his religious views. Bradfield, 
Lancing, and Radley represent this tendency. Sherborne 
is also a school where no direct Arnoldian influence can be 
traced. But even when full account has been taken of all 
the schools where no such influence is evident, it is clear 
that it was the others which led the way, attained the 
more commanding numbers, impressed the public mind, 
and carried the rest along with them. 
Arnold’s influence was by no means confined to the 
twenty or more schools which became large boarding- 
schools and rivals of the seven. Four examples may be 
taken from the great day-schools. Prince Lee, afterwards 
bishop of Manchester, left Rugby to become headmaster 
of King Edward’s School, Birmingham (1837-1848). 
Among his pupils were three great bishops, Benson, Light- 
foot, and Westcott. Walker, a pupil of Rugby under Tait 
and a master under Temple, spread Arnold’s influence, first 
to Manchester, where his work was warmly commended 
by the Schools Inquiry Commission, and afterwards to 
St Paul’s (1876). Mr McDonnell, in his History of St Paul’s 
School, describes him as “‘the one headmaster of his time 
1 The late Mr Leach, whom no one would suspect of clericalist 
sympathies, was undoubtedly led astray by his Wykehamist loyalty.

who attempted to show that education of the best possible 
kind, both moral and intellectual, could be given in sur- 
roundings different from those of the stereotyped boarding- 
schools.” Finally, J. S. Phillpotts, a Rugby master, 
initiated the growth of Bedford (1862-1874) from a curse 
to the town under guise of a charity! into its present posi- 
tion as a school which has attracted residents to Bedford 
on such a scale as to double the population of the town in 
twenty-five years. 
Arnold was evidently not without honour in his own 
country, as in addition to Lee at Birmingham we find one 
of his assistants, Hill, headmaster of Warwick from 1843 
to 1878, and one of his pupils, J. P. Collis, raising the old 
foundation school at Bromsgrove? into a really good first- 
grade school, though smaller in numbers than most of those 
which we have mentioned. Still more interesting is it to 
find Arnold influencing Nonconformist schools. Mill Hill 
was founded in 1807 and was intended from the first to 
follow public school lines; but, apart from the classical 
curriculum, the founders had evidently no clear idea what 
were the points to be imitated in a public school of their 
day, and we hardly wonder at it. But Priestly (1834-1853) 
considered the problem solved by the appearance of 
Arnold; for he corresponded with him’, tried to imitate his 
confidence in boys, and occasionally despaired. “This is 
what Arnold calls ‘boy nature,’” he exclaimed when some 
boys had committed an act of meanness, “but what am 
I to do with the eleven boys*?”” Here is an instance of 
a headmaster of another denomination treating Arnold 
during his life-time as the accepted ideal of a head. When 
Arnold’s Life was published, a member of the committee 
suggested that many of his customs might be introduced 
at Mill Hill, but Mr James considers® that the imitation

2 Later Millington, a disciple of Thring, left a lasting name here. 
We wonder if there is any other instance of a school which came under 
the double influence of Thring and of Arnold.

“was too close and detailed” and lacked the spirit of true 
confidence in the boys and reliance on the monitors. 
It must be admitted that Arnold’s influence was helped 
on by the fact that he was a Liberal and a Broad Church- 
man. Conservatives and High Churchmen were, so to speak, 
the natural allies of the public schools and might be 
suspected of more anxiety to defend than to reform them. 
Arnold largely won over those who would support them 
only if they were reformed. He defended them more for 
what they might become than for what they were. His 
type of churchmanship, which sought union between the 
Church of England and Nonconformists, not from in- 
difference to distinctive tenets, but from his profound sense 
of the importance of what they had in common, was the 
only type which could have led Nonconformists to send 
their boys with perfect confidence to schools staffed for 
the most part by clergy of the Church of England. What- 
ever be our views on the question of the “schoolmaster- 
parson” at the present day, it is indisputable that, almost 
up to the close of the nineteenth century, parents had more 
confidence in clergymen as headmasters than in laymen. 
Even Nonconformist members of governing bodies hardly 
trusted a layman to exercise the same influence on his 
pupils’ characters, even if they were able to escape a 
suspicion that his reluctance to take orders was due to 
a feeling of unfitness. Indeed Arnold is sometimes blamed 
for perpetuating the clerical headmaster by being so un- 
conscionably good a specimen of a bad class! 
If we are satisfied that Arnold really exercised the 
influence which is attributed to him, it hardly matters to 
discuss whether his reputation is deserved. It is always 
easy to show that a great man was the product of his time, 
but this does not prove that he was merely its product. 
Arnold knew what other schools were doing, he read current 
educational literature, he bore the impress of Corpus and 
Oriel. He could not have succeeded had the time not been 
ripe; there was need of parents who demanded an improve- 
ment in the moral and intellectual tone of schools before 
schools could be created to satisfy their demands. Nor
-P-A-G-E-92

could he have succeeded in “mending” the public schools 
among a people who had not the English preference for 
“mending” to “ending.” But, when it is urged that his 
reputation is due only to the lucky accident of his posses- 
sing two such biographers as Dean Stanley and Thomas 
Hughes, we have to ask whether it was not precisely this 
power of influencing pupils so unlike as Arthur Stanley and 
Tom Hughes which was the secret of his greatness. All his 
life he was getting other people to transmit his enthusiasm. 
That was how it spread. That is how the influence of all 
great moral reformers spreads and is the proof that a man 
is a great moral reformer. 
More serious than such arguments is Mr Lytton Strachey’s 
line of criticism in Eminent Victorians. He recognises fully 
as a historical fact that Arnold set the type for public 
schools in the nineteenth century; he indulges in no stock 
argument by which a great man is explained as a mere 
link in a chain of causes; he does not even labour the point 
that some of his contemporaries labelled his products as 
prigs. Had no one described them by some unpleasant 
epithet, the probability would be that there was nothing 
new in the type. In reading Mr Strachey, however, we 
must carefully distinguish the definite arguments from the 
general impression produced by his masterly power of 
grouping his material. We believe that Mr Strachey could 
tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, 
and yet so group the truth that he would make St Francis 
appear as a super-tramp and Caesar as an arch-gambler 
who won the world by “going double or quits” over his 
gaming debts. The serious educational criticism is con- 
tained in his account of the manner in which a reforming 
headmaster would proceed to-day. He would try the effect 
of civilising his pupils. He would invite his sixth to his 
wife’s drawing-room; he would introduce them to modern 
literature, art, and music; he would make them realise 
what counted to men. We suspect that, allowing for the 
difference of the age, this was what Vittorino da Feltre 
and the other great Italian teachers of the Renaissance did. 
Thring is certainly far nearer to this ideal than Arnold.
-P-A-G-E-93

Arnold was something of a Puritan; he thought it waste 
of time for boys to read Nicholas Nickleby. Yet, if Arnold 
had been a century ahead of his time, he would very likely 
have failed. The father of Matthew Arnold must surely 
have had something of the spirit of sweetness and light in 
him, but the age was not congenial to it. The young bar- 
barian of the thirties was not prepared to be moralised by 
aesthetic. The bullies of Tom Brown were very different 
raw material from the athleticised products of the pre- 
paratory school who are depicted in the Loom of Youth. 
Mr Strachey’s error is the same as that of certain con- 
temporaries who think of Russian Bolsheviks as British 
working men who happen to speak a foreign language. 
Bolsheviks are the brutalised products of brutality; so 
were the fag-roasting bullies of Rugby. British working 
men are good-hearted folk who from time to time get a 
wrong sense of values into their heads; so are Alec Waugh’s 
athletic-crazy public school boys. Mr Strachey makes good 
sport with Arnold’s references to the Old Dispensation; 
but, to brace himself for his task, Arnold, like Luther, had 
to think he was fighting the devil in hand to hand conflict. 
Nowadays the devil lays mines and disappears, and head- 
masters need wile rather than hard hitting to defeat 
him. 
The mention of the Loom of Youth brings us to our last 
point. There must be readers who have exclaimed, “ Why 
discuss whether Arnold was the father of the public school 
system, when the progeny is so little one to be proud of?” 
The public schools have certainly run off Arnold’s main 
track on to the siding of athleticism. A means has become 
an end. Alec Waugh’s picture is incomplete, but it is 
probably true. Very bad things happen in public schools; 
they probably happened far more frequently a hundred 
years ago. There are many good things which public schools 
fail to do; in particular, they fail to make the majority of 
their pupils into really educated men; we believe the same 
to be true of every single kind of educational institution 
in the country. Unfortunately it is very difficult to see any 
man or any institution as it really is and not to condemn
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 THE REVIVAL IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS {[cu. 
it; because we unconsciously make comparisons with other 
men or other institutions, which we have never seen without 
a halo. Still more difficult is it to see the seamy side of 
anything and to supply the good side. Moreover to know 
a man or to be a member of an institution is a very different 
thing from seeing it as it really is. Alec Waugh’s descrip- 
tion of his old school may contain nothing but truth; yet 
those who are led by its perusal to a wholesale condemna- 
tion of modern public schools, had they happened to be 
pupils at that school, might not have recognised the 
picture. If a full picture were painted of any educational 
institution, old university or new, municipal school or 
elementary school, its admirers would be aghast. The 
failures it turned out, the chances it missed, the worst acts 
any of its members committed—in most cases only the 
recording angel chronicles them. May it not be that Alec 
Waugh’s school was superior in this, that it made him long 
for what it appeared not to supply—which is half-way to 
supplying it—while the majority of institutions send forth 
their alumni unconscious of what they lack? 
In any case Arnold is no more responsible for the develop- 
ment of public schools for all time than was St Francis 
for the friars of Chaucer’s day or Aristotle for a fourteenth 
century disputation. His prefects were the sixth form 
chosen for their brains, not athletes chosen for their bodily 
prowess. Games were to him merely a particular way of 
spending leisure, preferable to poaching, window-smashing, 
or drinking, not the serious purpose of life. Arnold routed 
the army which the devil brought up against him in his 
own day, so that few of his Old Regulars are fighting now; 
he is not to blame that the devil has raised new levies. 
Bullying is dead; fear of ‘‘bad form” has taken its place. 
Hostility to religion has been replaced by indifference, 
intentional blasphemy by meaningless oaths, lawlessness 
by over-obedience to the “bloods,” idleness by turning 
play into work. To put the matter toa practical test: would 
a parent nowadays send his son to a public school if he 
had only the schools of 1820 to choose from? And are 
there not plenty of schools, large and small, to which he
-P-A-G-E-95

can safely send him to-day? The devil’s reserves are not 
equal to his shock troops. A few of the latter remain, and 
some of Alec Waugh’s readers may mistake them for new 
recruits: they are only the hardest to kill of the original 
force. If anyone under estimates Arnold because he did 
not anticipate the devil’s moves a hundred years ahead, 
that man does not know the devil.

CHAPTER IV 
NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION 
~NGLISH education has developed from its two poles. 
It began, at the one end with the two universities 
and a few public schools, at the other with the monitorial 
schools of Bell and Lancaster. The middle was filled in last. 
The age of leaving the elementary school was gradually 
raised, ‘‘ex-VII standards” were added, evening con- 
tinuation schools were attempted, till the Fisher Act of 
1918 finally completed the growth that came from the 
bottom upwards. Concurrently there was taking place 
another development from the top downwards. The reform 
of public schools was followed by a revival of the smaller 
grammar schools along similar lines in the seventies. The 
success of this experiment led to a further demand for 
secondary education, and the beginning of the twentieth 
century saw the creation of municipal and county schools. 
The two growths thus met in the middle. When the con- 
tinuation school clauses of the Fisher Act come into full 
force, it will be possible to say that all English boys and 
girls between five and eighteen are being educated. The 
period from 1815 to 1918 has secured the quantity of 
schooling; future improvements must be in its quality. 
For thirty years after 1815 the universities, the public 
schools, and the monitorial schools were almost the only 
ancestors of our present educational institution which had 
any vitality. It is obvious, however, that two universities 
and less than a dozen public schools were educating only 
a fraction of the population which was over the very low 
elementary school age of that time; and we must consider 
how the rest were provided for, so far as they were pro- 
vided for at all. 
The Report of the Schools Inquiry Commission in 1868 
is a mine of information concerning the old grammar

schools. There were no less than 782 endowments for 
secondary education, though in fifty cases the schools had 
ceased to exist at the time of the Commission. Of these 
schools, 209 or 27 per cent. were nominally classical, though 
132 of them sent no boys to the universities; 183 or 23 per 
cent. taught Latin but no Greek, and 340 or 43 per cent. 
were non-classical. They taught 9279 boarders and 27,595 
day boys. The classical schools mostly dated from the 
Middle Ages or from the reign of Queen Elizabeth; the 
non-classical foundations were later. The early foundations 
almost invariably provided for the work being carried on 
by “‘one schoolmaster and one usher.” Such an arrange- 
ment was almost unworkable, however small the number 
of pupils; yet the numbers were rarely sufficient to permit 
of more, and sometimes the funds were barely adequate 
for that. The Leeds judgment (1805) had forbidden a 
grammar school to be turned into a non-classical school, 
even where there was no demand for a classical education. 
It became, however, more and more difficult to enforce 
this decision, and in 1840 an act was passed allowing the 
Court of Chancery to relax it. The Commission found great 
variations both in curriculum and in efficiency according 
to locality; but whatever improvements had taken place 
were much more recent than 1815. The classical teaching 
was generally poor. The decadence was most noteworthy 
in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Cornwall, where the 
main function of classics seemed to be ‘‘to furnish the 
pretext for the neglect of all other useful learning!.” In 
Staffordshire and Warwickshire there were only 97 boys 
who with unlimited time and with the help of dictionaries 
“would be able to make out an ordinary passage of Cicero 
or Vergil?.”’ In Lancashire, however, many had recently 
adopted a “commercial” curriculum, not without im- 
provement. Generally speaking, the non-classical schools 
were even worse than the classical; science was not taught 
at all, and French and mathematics were badly taught. 
In fact no one had a clear idea what a non-classical school 
should do. In many cases the state of things amounted to

a positive scandal. At Whitgift School, Croydon, now a 
first-grade school of over 300 boys, the headmaster had 
held office for thirty years but there were no pupils! 
Sedbergh, which earlier in the century a headmaster 
named Evans had conducted with great success, and 
which has risen again to a prominent position, had 
dropped to thirteen boys, but the governors had no 
remedy against the headmaster. Much the same happened 
at Wakefield, the head having discovered that his tenure 
was a freehold. At Kingston the dormitory had been 
turned into a billiard-room, and the headmaster com- 
placently assured the investigators that “it was not worth 
while with £200 a year.” At Skipton the head employed 
his son and nephew as assistants and the teaching was 
hopelessly bad. At Bingley the headmaster taught his 
own son and the vicar’s and neglected the rest. Since the 
Restoration, governors had far too often been guilty of 
neglect and sometimes of actual jobbery and misappro- 
priation. Probably at any given time, however, there were 
a few schools, though not always the same schools, in 
which a good scholar was giving a sound classical founda- 
tion to a few boys who would proceed to the universities, 
as was the case with Dr Johnson. And in such cases the 
boys may have had other advantages. Charles Kingsley, 
for instance, though he laments that he was not sent to a 
public school, from a notion, probably mistaken, that it 
would have cured his shyness, would probably never have 
had the-same opportunities for pursuing his botanical and 
geological hobbies as he had at Helston Grammar School?; 
and Kingsley did not miss his first in classics through his 
scientific pursuits. 
Besides the endowed schools there were about 10,000 
private schools. These no commission ever investigated, 
and nothing like an adequate history of them will ever be 
told. They were of every variety of kind and quality. Their 
pupils would now be found in public schools, in municipal 
and county schools, in technical schools, in elementary 
schools. Wealthy parents might send their sons to a

  Iv] NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION 85 
private school from fear of bad tone or bullying in a public 
school or to secure their own form of religious influence. 
Country clergymen, lawyers, and doctors had no fixed 
tradition in the matter; it depended on such accidental 
factors as acquaintance with the headmaster where a boy 
was sent. Farmers and shopkeepers had no other provision 
than private schools in districts which had no neighbouring 
grammar school or where it was totally inefficient. Social 
distinctions operated more powerfully to prevent parents 
from sending their children to elementary schools when ele- 
mentary schools where charitable and not public institu- 
tions. Cheapness or dearness, the efficiency of the headmaster 
or the inefficiency of his grammar school rival, the success 
with which Latin was taught or the fact that Latin was not 
taught at all, the desire to keep a boy at home or the desire 
to get rid of him from home, might any of them be reasons 
for choosing for him a private school. Quite a substantial 
proportion of boys reached the universities who had never 
been to any endowed school. 
One characteristic only did private schools possess in 
common, that the boys were much more closely supervised. 
This was what Cotton referred to when he told his Marl- 
borough boys that he would not govern them as a private 
school. The words would call up to his youthful hearers a 
vision of boys marching two by two and watched every 
moment of day and night. There had been a time when this 
was a deliberate ideal in England, as it has always been in 
France. Public school liberty arose because it spelt liberty 
for the masters long before it was accepted as good for 
the boys. The really devoted parent and the really devoted 
teacher believed in supervision. Locke was an Englishman 
to the core; but he believed in the private tutor. This older 
attitude was by no means dead. With the aristocracy Eton, 
Harrow, or Winchester had undoubtedly become the 
fashion, but it’ was not de rigueur; the professional classes 
still halted between two opinions. 
The methods of teaching both in classical and in non- 
classical schools would be inconceivable to-day. Outside 
the public schools, the text-books which were in use are

our main source of evidence; but they are amply sufficient. 
A modern teacher would fling them away and dictate his 
own. In classical schools the Eton Grammar, a descendant 
of Lily’s, was in common use. Garretson’s Exercises chiefly 
astonish us by assuming that the whole of the accidence is 
learned before the pupil attempts to write the simplest 
Latin sentence. On the very first page words of all de- 
clensions and all conjugations are showered on the learner, 
who apparently writes Latin by rule before he has seen it 
written. The exercises follow the order of the rules in the 
Eton syntax, but assume a rate of progress which we know 
to be impossible. The dictionary confuses its user by giving 
from half-a-dozen to a score of English equivalents for 
a Latin word and vice versa, with no examples to show their 
meaning. When the pupil reached the stage of reading 
authors, no edition with vocabulary and notes welcomed 
him. The Eton books of extracts were indeed editions, but 
they were intended for the upper forms only, and they 
perplexed more than they elucidated. Plain texts of Vergil, 
Caesar, and Nepos were the rule. To make beginners look 
out every word in the dictionary and hammer out the sense 
for themselves was regarded as part of the mental discipline. 
It rarely occurred to anyone that the method by which the 
learner starts should bear some relation to the methods by 
which his mind must work if he is to become expert. 
A method which eliminated Sprachgefuihl and unconscious 
use of analogy could not lead up to a sense of style or a 
power of translation at sight. It created the habit of 
regarding Latin sentences as brick puzzles—the idea that 
Latin translation consists in forcing the words by rule into 
grammatical but nonsensical English. The Gradus created 
the same brick-puzzle conception of the way to piece 
together Latin hexameters and pentameters. It may be 
safely assumed that Butler’s improvements in the teaching 
of classics were long in reaching the grammar and private 
schools, save in occasional instances such as that of Don- 
caster (1808-1846) at Oakham, who practised them with 
success. A few teachers like the Hills! may have freed

themselves from the incubus of the text-book by oral 
teaching on their own lines. 
The non-classical schools provided a curriculum hardly 
as wide as that of elementary schools at the present day. 
Outside the “three R’s” the text-books indicate cram. of 
the worst kind. Most of them were set out in the form of 
a catechism, and were clearly intended to be learned by 
heart, the teacher’s sole function being to ask the questions 
prescribed in the book. Among the opponents of the 
traditional classical course had arisen a passion for ‘“‘ useful” 
knowledge such as excited F. D. Maurice’s query, ‘‘ Useful 
for what?” The seventeenth century might be thought to 
have exhausted the possibilities of abstracts and epitomes; 
but the sum of human knowledge was greater now than 
in the age of Comenius, and closer packing was needed to 
get it into the required space. Here are the contents of 
a little text-book of 340 pages bearing the date 1821, which 
was presumably popular, since this is the eighteenth edition. 
It is styled An Easy Introduction to the Arts and Sciences. 
It deals in catechetical form with religion, logic, morality, 
atmospheric phenomena, sound, earthquakes and vol- 
canoes, the tides, metaphysics, jurisprudence, medicine, 
chemistry, botany, grammar, rhetoric, metre, mathematics, 
architecture, painting, sculpture, mechanics, chronology, 
astronomy, geography, history, mythology, natural history, 
mineralogy, pneumatics, hydrostatics, electricity, gal- 
vanism, artificial memory, and the drama. The reasons for 
the sequence are not indicated. Only when he reaches 
mythology does the writer really launch out, this section 
occupying thirty pages, an amount beaten only by natural 
history with thirty-six. A small amount of mind-building 
material could possibly be extracted from this book, but 
Mangnall’s Questions probably accomplished, more com- 
pletely and more distastefully than any book ever written, 
the task of conveying to the learner an impression of 
familiarity with every classical, historical, political, or 
legal allusion, without giving a grain of real knowledge. 
Even the text-books which limited themselves to one 
subject were in other respects no better. Guy’s Geography

a standard class-book in the middle of the century, boasts 27 6 eloquently of a ‘‘new plan” “which was pursued by the 
compiler for years in the Royal Military College, and in 
no place of Education is this branch of Knowledge taught 
more expeditiously or more thoroughly.” The ‘“‘plan” is 
nothing else than this:—‘‘Only the pages printed in the 
larger Roman type [fifteen pages entirely composed of 
strings of names of the features of each continent] should 
first be learned by heart. The divisions printed in Italics 
at the head of each country may form a second course 
[mainly provinces and chief towns]. And, if the pupil’s 
time will permit, a third course of very careful reading 
through the smaller type (so as to enable him to answer 
the General Questions subjoined, page 163) will communi- 
cate a much greater body of valuable information than 
can be derived from any other school treatise.” These 
questions are, ‘Is the country divided into provinces, 
governments, departments, states or counties, etc.? and 
how many? Have their names changed? If so what are 
they? Repeat the chief cities and say for what noted,” 
etc.,etc. Some history text-books were in catechetical form, 
but the best at least gave a continuous narrative. Though 
modern text-books of history do not inform their readers 
that Homer was the most famous of Greek historians, they 
have not made so great an advance on the pedagogic side 
as have the best geographical text-books. Popular as- 
tronomy benefited more than any other scientific subject 
from the love of presenting the results of modern science 
to schoolboys and schoolgirls; and, the present writer, 
having as a boy of eight lighted on an old school-book used 
by his aunt, is able to affirm that much ofit was intelligiblet. 
The same, however, cannot be confidently asserted of the 
teaching which had been given from it, as his aunt could 
scarcely have been trusted to recognise Jupiter with 
certainty. With what success the “Use of the Globes,”

for the intelligence, was taught must, we fear, be left a 
matter of conjecture. Would that we had as clear an idea 
how an early nineteenth century teacher proceeded with 
the following problem as we have of the way in which 
Brinsley taught Latin in the early seventeenth century! 
To find at what time any star rises, culminates, and sets at 
any given latitude and day. 
Adjust the globe to the state of the heavens for that day 
and place at noon, bring the star to the eastern verge of the 
horizon, the horary circle will then show the hour of its rising; 
bring the star to the meridian, the circle will then show the 
time of its culminating; and the time of its setting will be 
shewn by bringing the star to the western verge. 
What is the time of Aldebaran’s rising, culminating, and 
setting June 16 at London? Ams. About } past 3 in the

The more enlightened text-books of popular science, 
dealing with light, mechanics, hydrostatics, etc., in a non- 
mathematical way, bear a strong impress of Rousseau, 
both in subject-matter and in the idea of experimenting 
with improvised apparatus. The omniscient tutor who 
appears in this class of book is clearly cousin german 
to Mr Barlow of Sandford and Merton. They were pre- 
sumably meant for tutors and parents of Edgeworth type 
rather than for schools. 
We can hardly condemn the schools or the parents of 
the period for clinging to their classics. The weapons of 
the “reformers” were hardly of a kind to drive classics 
from the fortress in which it had been ensconced for 
centuries. Before new subjects could demand admittance, 
their supporters must show that they could be taught 
as intelligently as Butler and Arnold were teaching 
classics. 
Contemporary literature preserves for us some recollec- 
tions of the private school. Dickens, in Mr Squeers’s 
Dotheboys Hall, has created one immortal picture of the 
worst type. It may be well therefore to give a short account 
of one of the best. 
Private schools have at least the liberty to experiment.  
-P-A-G-E-104
  go NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION [cH. 
A remarkable experiment was made in the early years of 
the century in a private school near Birmingham by two 
brothers who afterwards became famous in other spheres, 
Rowland Hill, the author of penny postage, and Matthew 
Davenport Hill, the criminal law reformer. Not only so, 
but their experiment was an application to school con- 
ditions of the very principles which they afterwards. so 
successfully applied to the body politic, that punishment 
should be reformatory, and that up to a certain point by 
demanding less you get more. The Hazelwood scheme gave 
far more self-government to the boys than any form of the 
prefect system. The closest modern parallel is the George 
Junior Republic. It is thought to have had some influence 
on Thomas Arnold. 
The brothers Hill took over their father’s school in 
Birmingham. He was so poor a financier that Rowland 
managed his business affairs from the age of seventeen. 
The boys had been brought up in the school atmosphere; 
Rowland had begun to teach at twelve. They were therefore 
largely self-educated, but this was not without advantage 
both to the scope of their interests and to their pedagogic 
attitude. A formal schooling might have confined them 
to classics; as it was, their interests covered not only 
mathematics but subjects so unusual in those days as 
surveying and various manual crafts. They avoided, how- 
ever, the growing craze among educational modernists for 
the mere pouring forth of knowledge; indeed the most 
striking feature in their teaching was their constant use 
of the pupils’ activity. Classics, mathematics, French, and 
English constituted the class syllabus; but rarely has a 
system of options been so well devised to encourage the 
pupils to devote serious attention to hobbies of their own 
choice. It is, nevertheless, sad to think that it was the 
lack of that prestige which comes from university dis- 
tinctions which prevented their experiment from having 
a wider influence and left them without successors. 
Their methods of government and teaching were so 
interdependent that neither would retain its identity with- 
out the other. Both depended on two premises, the first
-P-A-G-E-105
Iv] NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION gr 
that the motives which influence adults are among those 
which influence boys, though they never regarded them as 
the sole motives; the second that a right training for life 
should therefore embrace the direction of these motives 
which commonly guide life. The second of these proposi- 
tions would commend itself to modern educationalists if 
they could convince themselves of the truth of the first. 
But the first is truer than is often thought. The old mistake 
was for scholarly men to picture all boys as budding 
scholars; the new mistake is to forget that the majority 
of men have never grown up either intellectually or morally, 
but remain big schoolboys—good-hearted, energetic, im- 
pulsive, short-sighted, changeable, tireless over a self- 
imposed task but ready to use any device to shirk a task 
imposed by others, straight in their dealings with their 
own companions but inclined to regard all other types of 
mankind as unreasonable. Personally we are convinced 
that the minority of men who think ahead and regulate 
their conduct by logical principles begin to do so at school 
and that the rest remain such as we have described. 
The Hills’ experiment then was an attempt to readjust 
the balance between the motives for study which might 
be brought to bear on boys. Of these, love of the subject, 
joy in successful activity, competition, reward, and punish- 
ment have at different times been in favour. The Hills took 
a very sensible view concerning the scope of the first 
motive. In few cases will boys really prefer classics or 
mathematics to lighter pursuits. Hence this motive was 
restricted to choice of options—general réading, composi- 
tion, and various manual subjects, such as drawing, model- 
ling, and surveying. Even in these congenial subjects they 
saw that interest alone will not make a boy wish to continue 
when difficulties become rife and steady application is 
needed: so in every case they required the definite com- 
pletion of some piece of work before any account was taken 
of it. The same principle was applied in the regular class 
subjects: as soon as the pupil had done his work without 
a mistake, he could leave the class. In no subject was 
passive receptivity allowed except in the early stages of
-P-A-G-E-106
  92 NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION [cH. 
learning languages, which they reasonably regarded as an 
essentially imitative process. The use of the dictionary was 
therefore postponed and very careful class work took its 
place. The Hills had hit on the right principle, though it 
has been left to recent times to work it out in the direct 
method. But for subjects like history, descriptive geo- 
graphy, and popular science, the bold plan was adopted 
of letting the pupils read what they liked so long as they 
were willing to stand an oral test on it, a method which 
would win the approval of Miss Charlotte Mason at the 
present day. Joy in successful activity was therefore well 
recognised; and this joy is identical with the play motive, 
which was at one time thought to be peculiar to childhood, 
but is now recognised as the spring of energy not only in 
the artist but in every worker who approaches his work in 
the artist’s spirit. 
The three motives of competition, reward, and punish- 
ment were rolled into one. The Hills had no false illusions 
about the sense of duty, which they recognised to be the 
goal of education rather than its spring. Schoolboys have 
a sense of duty just as soldiers have. Soldiers will face 
death, but they will not dig trenches, from a sense of 
duty. Adult work, save when it is done in the spirit of 
the artist—and preliminary spade-work can hardly be done 
in that spirit—is mainly based on one of these three 
motives. To the Englishman or American competition 
means “beating the other fellow,” not, as with the Latin 
races, hoping for a statue to record your victory. He neither 
brags over his success nor, like the old Assyrian kings, 
wishes to engage inferior rivals in order to secure a soft 
victory. Competition was accepted at Hazelwood as an 
honourable motive. The shape, however, which it assumed 
was peculiar. A foreigner might say that it was the natural 
shape for it to assume among a ‘“‘nation of shopkeepers.’ 
Among adults in a mercantile community money is the 
usual reward of industry, and want of it the usual punish- 
ment for idleness. If, as Spencer afterwards asserted, the 
consequences of action in childhood ought to be made as 
like as possible to those of mature life, the corollary seems
-P-A-G-E-107
Iv] NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION 93 
to be obvious, and the Hills did not shrink from it. But 
the Hills were acquainted with political economy, and 
knew that money is only a symbol of value and a medium 
of exchange, the true value residing in the commodities 
which it will purchase. They therefore invented a school 
coinage which would purchase those commodities which 
schoolboys desire, holidays, privileges, and the like. 
Punishments consisted in the loss of these counters or 
“marks.”’ Marks, i.e. dummy coins, were won for place 
in class, but mainly for the performance of options, while 
they were lost wholesale for even a single mistake in set 
work: Punishments for work, in the strict sense, only 
began with bankruptcy, when detentions were imposed 
until enough optional work had been done to render the 
defaulter once more solvent. 
Ardent supporters of the Liberal movement, the Hills 
introduced the methods of constitutional government into 
their school. The masters regulated the curriculum, but 
the boys, through elected committees, controlled the 
discipline. The constituencies were so arranged as to give 
great weight to position in the school. The criminal code 
was the work of the boys, though masters were, so to 
speak, ex officio magistrates in class. In cases of doubt 
the boys themselves furnished judge and jury. The authors 
of this system, which reads at first like a Gilbert and Sullivan 
opera, claimed that it worked so well that justice rarely 
miscarried. Corporal punishment was abolished; fines, loss 
of privileges, temporary interdiction of social intercourse 
and, in the last resort, confinement in the dark being the 
recognised penalties. 
Fortunately we have the impressions of an old pupil, 
who seems to be a man of common-sense, on the effects of 
the system. W. L. Sargant, in his Essays by a Birmingham 
Manufacturer’, writes: ““By juries and committees, by 
marks, and by appeals to a sense of honour, discipline was 
maintained. But this was done, I think, at too great a 
sacrifice: the thoughtlessness, the spring, the elation of 
childhood were taken from us; we were premature men:

  94 NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION [cH. 
one of my younger schoolfellows told me that as an elder 
boy, being appointed after I left a guardian over his 
juniors ’’—this was the way in which the happy-go-lucky 
juniors were by a kindly but steady pressure broken in 
to the system—‘‘the responsibility weighed on him so 
heavily that he meditated suicide; and yet there was not 
a tinge of morbidness in his temperament. The school was 
in truth a moral hotbed, which forced us into a precocious 
imitation of maturity. I have heard an Oxford friend say 
that Arnold’s men had a little of the prig about them: 
I know too well that some of us had a great deal of the 
prig about us: I have often wished that I had the ‘giftie 
to see ourselves as others see us’; but I have comforted 
myself with observing that in later life my schoolfellows 
(perhaps therefore I myself) outgrew this unamiable 
character.” ; 
With this verdict that it was a hotbed of prigs some 
readers may be content to leave it. Clearly it was not an 
aggregate of units struggling each against each like the 
world of the Manchester School. It did not produce an 
“economic boy’’: there was no ‘“‘de’il tak’ the hindmost.”” 
The smaller and weaker, who were slaves at the public 
school, were treated as colts to be trained at Hazelwood. 
And is not this the only judicious relation which can sub- 
sist between older and younger boys? The system clearly 
escapes the Scylla of encouraging a ‘‘mercantile spirit,’ 
if indeed it was not a moralising of that spirit: what of the 
Charybdis of training prigs? A prig, we take it is one who 
does by rule good actions which other people, if they do 
them at all, do automatically. Consequently, every time 
he does a good action, he is aware of the fact. He is there- 
fore in risk of being conceited, and he may also become a 
casuist. He is inclined to become self-centred, in which 
case his separate virtues become an aggregate vice. He 
may be suspected of being censorious; for his habit of 
finely weighing his own motives may be transferred to 
those of others. If priggishness be accompanied by none 
of these derivative qualities, it annoys us only mildly, in 
the same way as a halting speech, a clumsy stroke at
-P-A-G-E-109
  Iv] NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION 95 
cricket, or any other action in which the effort seems dis- 
proportionate to the achievement. A prig is like a man 
who has learned etiquette from a book: he does not know 
how to be good neatly or naturally. Most boys pass through 
a hobbledehoy stage of awkwardness before their manners 
become automatic; may it not be that they have to pass 
through a stage of mild priggishness before their morals 
become so? If so, our aim is to keep this priggishness 
within its proper limits; and unfortunately a system, 
whatever it is, which suits the average boy, may over- 
develop it in a specially susceptible boy. It is extremely 
probable that the Hills’ system did make for overmuch 
introspection and for an over-developed sense of responsi- 
bility. But it was an experiment, and a slight modification 
may be all that was needed to achieve success. Possibly 
the absence of group games, for which running, jumping, 
swimming, and gymnastics were not a complete substitute, 
and the number of hours spent indoors, even though many 
of them were spent on music and hobbies, were the factors 
which needed to be changed. To feel responsibility all day 
long is enough to drive any man, much more any boy, mad; 
but a system which encourages a sense of responsibility is 
good, as long as a time limit is set. 
Even the curious system of self-government must not 
be dismissed too lightly. Introduced into an old-established 
institution in which “‘schoolboy trade unionism” had long 
prevailed, it would doubtless lead to anarchy as surely 
as the change from autocracy to Soviet government did in 
Russia. But it is conceivable that, once firmly established, 
a system by which boys devise the scale of penalties might 
work at least as easily as the prefect system by which the 
senior boys administer them. The danger of a boy State is 
more likely to be ultra-conservatism than ultra-radicalism. 
The Hills argued that public opinion alone is really effective 
in enforcing rules and that a slight inferiority in the rules 
is amply compensated for by a real enforcement. The 
insuperable difficulty in rejecting it is that it worked; and, 
till it is given a fair trial again by a believer in it and found 
not to work, that is a powerful argument. The history of

the experiment is a further caution against a belief that 
the internal management of schools could only have 
developed on one set of lines. Here, slightly before Arnold’s 
time, was an experiment different from his; but Arnold 
was a man of known attainments, working in a famous 
school, who found imitators, while the Hills were men of 
moderate education, working in a private school, who 
found none. 
Having glanced at various types of secondary schools, 
we naturally ask next what part was played by private 
tutors or parents. Private tuition was not popular among 
the wealthy class in England, the only class which could 
afford it, as it had been in Renaissance times, or as it was 
in France to a much later date. Except those who entered 
the navy or army at an early age, the bulk of persons 
sufficiently distinguished to have found their way into 
the Dictionary of National Biography seem to have been 
at a school. Rousseau’s writings initiated a real movement 
in connection with home education, but it mainly con- 
cerned children below school age. It was probably one 
factor which contributed to the raising of the usual age 
for entry to a secondary school. At the Renaissance the 
usual age was six; Fox entered Eton at nine, Salisbury at 
ten, Gladstone at eleven: in the forties twelve was a usual 
age; by the sixties entrance was deferred till fourteen, and 
a preparatory school course preceded. In the case of day 
schools, eight or nine was a common age for entry in the 
first half of the century. Before preparatory schools became 
standardised it is not always easy to distinguish between 
a school and a tutor who took a number of pupils, as 
Arnold did at Laleham. 
The Edgeworths were, in the British Isles, the pioneers 
of reform in the home education of children. Their work 
does not fall within our period, but its effects lasted into 
it. R. L. Edgeworth’s Practical Education defended private 
education as ideally the best, but, where expense forbade, 
urged the postponement of schooling as late as possible. 
But, more than this, it suggested a reasonable scheme of 
home education to occupy these years of childhood. Home
-P-A-G-E-111
Iv] NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION 97 
education in fact was reformed before the reform of school 
education had begun. The modern parental tradition dates 
from this period. Toys became a recognised educational 
agency; games began to come into their rights; hobbies 
were encouraged. This civilising of children before they 
were sent to school has been of inestimable value. So long 
as boys were thought to have no inclinations except towards 
the exercise of their muscles and no opportunity was given 
for the development of other parts of their nature, the 
results naturally seemed to justify the belief. As soon as 
they were offered playful exercises which involved a use 
of their senses, of dexterity, of resource, of inventiveness, 
and of imagination, they responded with alacrity. The mere 
winning of parents’ interest in such matters was itself a 
gain; for, the more parents came to take part in the life 
of their children, the more influence did they come to 
exercise over their characters. The days when a father was 
regarded as properly an object of “awe” to his children— 
Locke’s ideal—were over. “Sir” was exchanged for “‘ papa,” 
and ‘‘papa,” in the less affected days that followed, for 
“dad.” 
These results have extended to multitudes who never 
heard the names of Rousseau or of the Edgeworths. The 
effects on definite instruction, such as playful methods of 
teaching reading, arithmetic, geometry, and drawing, and 
especially the attempt to teach elementary popular science, 
were more the mark of their conscious followers. The 
reason is not far to seek. The mother has inherited the 
tradition more than the father. Untrained maternal 
instinct was able to execute the programme in the one case, 
whereas considerable knowledge and thought are required 
in the other. It is, however, marvellous how a little 
judicious encouragement by parents who are without any 
special equipment will conduce to forming in a child a 
permanent taste for such subjects as history, geography, 
or popular science, even if the help be no more than assist- 
ance in reading a book. Till the spread of Kindergartens, it 
is doubtful whether professional teaching ever succeeded as 
well as such encouragement by parents and other relatives.

On the whole, however, formal education fell into the 
hands of governesses and small preparatory schools rather 
than of parents. As private schools lost ground with older 
boys, they gained it with younger children. The earlier 
stages of the rise in the age of entering school gave scope’ 
to the type of small preparatory school kept by elderly 
spinsters, while the later rise in the age of admission to 
large boarding schools introduced the more ambitious 
preparatory school of recent times. The latter may have 
to fight hard against preparatory departments instituted 
by the bigger schools: the former have already had to yield 
to a considerable extent to the Kindergartens which have 
become popular since the eighties. Doubtless they shone 
in part with a lustre borrowed from a few “teachers by 
the grace of God” such as Mrs Barbauld; but the majority 
taught the three R’s, the counties of England, the dates 
of the English monarchs, and the Latin declensions to 
children from seven to eleven, unaffected by modern views 
as to the use of play, or constructive work, or experiment. 
The Rousseau-Edgeworth movement differed in many 
ways from that of the Froebelians. It often forgot that 
children are children; it believed that character could be 
formed by an incessant iteration of moral saws; and it 
exalted the importance of ‘‘useful information.” The 
spirit of Dr Watts and Dr Watts’s prose imitators was 
everywhere. But home education is less liable than school 
education to be spoiled by a craze: almost any movement 
which stimulates parents is good; for the parent, watching 
more closely than the teacher the progress of his child’s 
mind and supplied by Nature with the gift of under- 
standing it, will usually know when a theory is being ridden 
to death. Hence the Edgeworth movement exhibited little 
of that too close adherence to the methods of its founder 
which, in the case of Pestalozzi’s followers in elementary 
education, spoiled most of the good which might have come 
from following his spirit. 
Hitherto we have been speaking only of the education 
of the upper and middle classes. At a time when the 
community as a whole was hardly yet convinced of the
-P-A-G-E-113
  
Iv] NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION 99 
desirability of elementary education for the working classes 
it was hardly likely that it should contemplate their further 
education. Higher education had always been a possession 
of the minority. The Middle Ages, in one sense, had been 
more democratic than subsequent periods; poor boys were 
not altogether debarred from a clerical education; but the 
clergy were a class by themselves, outside social distinc- 
tions, and the boy who entered their ranks ceased to be 
a member of any secular class. A manual calling had always 
been considered incompatible with a knowledge of more 
than the three R’s. From the strictly utilitarian stand- 
point of the Middle Ages, there was no unfairness in this; 
book-learning was merely one form of technical training, 
and King John, not being a priest, could no more sign his 
name than the Humblest villein. But the Renaissance 
treated education as having some other end than utili- 
tarian; it made for complete living, and was therefore 
sought by all who could afford it. Its restriction was 
therefore an injustice, based on notions which are now 
passing away. 
Sooner or later the doctrines of the French Revolution 
were bound to lead to a demand by the workers for levelling 
up or levelling down—for education or bolshevism. The 
years following 1789 were a time of party bitterness such 
as it is hard to realise to-day. The High Tories were under 
no illusions. The ‘‘stupid party” they were in one sense, 
that they had not the imagination to conceive that a more 
equal world would be a happier world. But they were not 
stupid, if stupidity means wrong judgment as to cause 
and effect. They were quite right in recognising that the 
Reform Bill was the first step towards political and social 
democracy, and therefore in treating the aristocratic Whigs 
as conscious or unconscious revolutionaries. After 1832 they 
saw that the battle was lost, and were content to be a brake 
on the democratic wheel—a function indispensable at 
times, though only intermittently needed. Till 1832, how- 
ever, they were powerful enough, had they pleased, to 
suppress, and even after 1832 to hinder, any attempt at 
the adult education of working men.

It was therefore fortunate that the initial attempts came 
in a form which they did not recognise as the thin edge of 
the wedge. They held that workmen should not be educated 
“above their class,’’ lest they should be unwilling to follow 
the drudgery of manual labour. This principle did not 
seem to apply to teaching them how to perform that labour. 
Here was a gap through which education could creep. The 
gap was quite recent. Fifty years earlier little which could 
stimulate the mind could have been taught in connection 
with the technical equipment of any manual craft. But 
natural science was just reaching the stage when it could 
be applied to industry. It was after all perhaps fortunate 
that the educated classes of those days—who were in- 
cluded in the middle and upper classes, though not identical 
with them—did not generally recoghise experimental 
science as a branch of liberal education, otherwise they 
might have annexed it. As it was, owing to its technical 
character, they gave the working classes access to this 
branch of liberal education; for such we must call any 
knowledge which enlarges the horizon, stimulates thought, 
and creates a sense of proof and of the relation between 
cause and effect. 
Though school science rarely did any of these things in 
its early days, very elementary science in the hands of men 
like Birkbeck certainly did. It was almost an accident 
which led to the beginnings of artisans’ education. Ander- 
son, a professor at Glasgow, had begun to hold systematic 
evening classes in 1760 and encouraged the attendance of 
working men. He was an early pioneer of science and fore- 
saw its industrial bearings. He left all his money by will 
to found a new type of university in which science should 
have priority; but, as his property only amounted to 
£1000, his trustees had to be content with establishing one 
chair of physics. Birkbeck, a Lancashire boy, educated at 
Edinburgh University, where he became acquainted with 
Scott, Jeffrey, Sydney Smith, and others of the galaxy of 
Edinburgh notables, was appointed to this chair. He 
needed apparatus and he had to instruct workmen how 
to make it. He was surprised at the zeal with which they
-P-A-G-E-115
Iv] NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION IOI 
listened to his directions, and he invited some of them to 
his lectures. Lack of space led him to propose lecturing 
to them separately. His committee opposed. “If invited, 
the mechanics would not come; if they came, they would 
not listen; if they listened, they would not comprehend.” 
Birkbeck insisted; they came, listened, and comprehended. 
Birkbeck had grasped the art of explaining technical 
matters in non-technical language—an art needed for 
other audiences besides mechanics. His topic was the 
mechanical properties of solid and fluid bodies, and his 
audience soon rose to five hundred. In a few years Birk- 
beck left Glasgow to start a medical practice in London, 
but the classes at “ Anderson’s Institution” continued till 
1823, when, owing to a dispute with the management about 
the use of the library, the mechanics seceded and formed 
their own organisation. They copied the name of the parent 
body and so arose the name of Mechanics’ “‘Institutions’”’ 
or “Institutes.”” In two years there were 1300 students 
and a library of 1639 volumes. The students appointed the 
lecturers and re-elected them annually. In one case five 
candidates were subjected to a lecturing competition! The 
sequel is instructive; the selected candidate proved a 
complete failure. In course of time a more normal type 
of organisation was adopted, and appointments were made 
by a committee. Though the first enthusiasm died out, the 
Institution continued to do sound work, attracting to its 
classes even students of the University such as the future 
Lord Kelvin. Professors from Anderson’s, which was 
developing into something more like a university, often 
lectured there. In 1879 it was swallowed up by the more 
modern organisation of technical instruction and its old 
democratic government passed away. Since 1881 it has 
been known as the Glasgow College of Science and Arts, 
and forms with Anderson’s and two other colleges a part 
of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College, 
whose diploma qualifies for all but the final year of the 
degree of Glasgow University. 
The London Mechanics’ Magazine now proposed the 
establishment of a similar institution in the metropolis,

which was supported by Francis Place, “‘ the radical tailor,’ 
who exercised a great political influence over artisans. He 
and Birkbeck collaborated and, after considerable difficulty 
due to personal matters, the Institute was started. The 
scheme was advertised by the radical newspaper the 
Morning Chronicle, and £2000 was raised by Lord Brougham, 
always a friend to popular education, and others. Birkbeck 
had to lend a large sum to make up the deficiency. In 1826 
the Institute was opened by the Duke of Sussex, one of 
George III’s sons, who had previously helped Lancaster. 
The apparatus cost 250 guineas, and there was a museum 
and a chemical laboratory. The movement met with some 
opposition, in which unfortunately the clergy took no in- 
considerable share, but a swarm of similar institutions 
followed, the movement spreading to many foreign coun- 
tries. By 1850 there were 610 institutions with 102,050 
members!; and 1837 Unions of Institutes were formed to 
engage common itinerant lecturers, though these unions 
were for the most part short-lived. 
Perhaps the most elaborate example was that at Liver- 
pool, to which William Ballantyne Hodgson was appointed 
secretary in 1838 at the age of twenty-three. Hodgson was 
one of the many men filled with a thirst for knowledge and 
a desire to convey it to his fellow-men whom Scotland 
produced in the first half of the nineteenth century. The 
son of strict Calvinist parents, he would in any case have 
known little of the joys of childhood; but he allowed him- 
self less. He never slept more than six hours and spent the 
rest in omnivorous reading. From Edinburgh University 
he went to Liverpool. There he had no easy time. Lectures 
of one kind or another went on from 8.30 in the morning till 
nine o'clock at night. Forty-eight lecturers contributed. 
But Hodgson proved himself even at this early age a con- 
summate manager of men; he smoothed away all difficulties, 
and proved a regular master of method to elderly and 
distinguished lecturers who were unskilled in adapting 
their subject-matter to their audience. He spent his 
holidays in going round Scottish high schools to pick up

hints, and was one of the first vigorous critics of the pre- 
valent catechetical teaching. From 1847 to 1851 he was 
headmaster of a school in Manchester, but was. then seized 
with a travel mania. The experience which he thus acquired 
made him a valuable member of the Newcastle Commission. 
From 1871 to his death he was the first occupant of the 
chair of political economy in Edinburgh. 
Mechanics’ Institutes, however, did not long fulfil their 
original object. Two changes became noticeable. By 1850 
the membership had largely ceased to be composed of 
working-men, who were replaced by clerks and ap- 
prentices. At the same time the educational side was 
subordinated to the recreational, and definite courses of 
instruction gave way to occasional popular lectures. 
Henceforth their history belongs less to that of education 
in its more restricted sense? than to that of clubs, 
libraries, Athenaeums, mutual improvement societies, 
village reading rooms, and the like, which form an honour- 
able chapter in the history of mid-Victorian endeavour. 
J. W. Hudson, writing in 18512, says that the Watt 
Institute in Edinburgh was then the only establishment 
in Great Britain which deserved the title of a ‘‘ People’s 
College.” 
The interaction of English and Scottish education has 
been of immense advantage. Two substances are necessary 
before chemical action can take place; and the meeting 
of English and Scottish ideas set up a ferment in educational 
thought. The English system was aristocratic. When the 
awakening came, it was therefore bound in England to take 
the form of an improvement in the quality of education, 
for aristocracies like things good of their kind: not in its 
distribution, for aristocracies are exclusive; nor in its 
character, for aristocracies are conservative. It was also 
likely to concern itself with the humanities rather than 
with the physical world; for statesmanship is the hereditary

occupation ofaristocracies. Probably the reason why English 
education was aristocratic was that the English Church 
was aristocratic, which in its turn. was because Henry VIII 
and Elizabeth had secured that the bishops should be 
virtually state-appointed officials. What the State was, 
the Church became; what the Church was, the universities 
became; and what the universities were, education became. 
In Scotland the Church was presbyterian, that is, as 
democratic as the state of popular education permitted. 
And so strong was theology in Scotland that, what the 
Church was, both State and education tended to become. 
The parish school was the citadel of Scottish education. 
The four universities taught boys of the same age as those 
in the English public schools; but they drew from the 
parish schools and therefore from all classes. When the 
awakening came in Scotland, it consequently took the 
form of a demand for a wider extension of education, for 
democracy stands for equal opportunities ; and for a change 
in its subject-matter, because the plain citizen was not 
looking forward to becoming a member of parliament or 
an ambassador. An uncongenial climate had made the 
Scotsman a keen man of business and, after the Industrial 
Revolution, a keen manufacturer. His interest was in 
political economy, in natural science, and in whatever else 
“paid.” 
Both tendencies were needed. The community needs a 
select body of carefully educated persons, in the interests 
alike of capable administration, of increase in the national 
wealth, of discoveries which promote the general happi- 
ness, and of the diffusion of ideals of culture which make 
for the fuller life of all. But it is likewise necessary that 
the area of choice should be as wide as possible, so that 
all who are born with the requisite ability should find their 
way into the select circle. Further, the whole community 
should be educated in the manner and up to the point 
which makes for fulness of living. Lastly, the highest 
education must be specialised along all the paths which 
lead the community to wealth, happiness, good govern- 
ment, and intellectual, aesthetic, and moral excellence.
-P-A-G-E-119
Iv] NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION 105 
The English striving for the higher education of the few 
in certain limited directions needed supplementing by the 
Scottish demand for a wider diffusion and a wider range 
of education. 
That these tendencies were really inspired from Scotland 
there can be little doubt. Lancashire and Yorkshire were 
industrially in advance of the northern kingdom, but it 
was only after they had been stirred from Scotland that 
educational need created an educational demand. In 
elementary education Bell and Lancaster were English, 
for Scotland already had a school in every parish, but its 
great reformers, Robert Owen, Wilderspin, and Stow, 
all worked in Scotland. The Edinburgh Review was the 
main critic of the English universities and public schools. 
The early advocates of science—George Combe, Birkbeck, 
Hodgson, and William Ellis—were all either Scots or 
educated in Scotland. Adult working-class education 
started there. The new subjects were welcomed in the 
Scottish universities. 
The democratic tendency had close relations with the 
scientific and the secularist movements. The reasons are 
not far to seek. The English Church, being aristocratic 
and conservative, sided with the old classics against the 
new science. Nonconformity was therefore drawn to 
democracy, innovation, and science. On the other hand, 
the French Revolution had been at once anti-Christian 
and anti-monarchical; hence there tended to be an alliance 
between Radicalism (a very different thing from Whiggism) 
and unorthodoxy, whether unitarian, agnostic, or atheistic. 
The Church and aristocracy being in possession, the two 
oppositions tended to act together and to be regarded as 
the right and left wings of one party. The practical question 
was the exclusion of non-Churchmen from the universities 
and from opportunities of higher education. The Non- 
conformist Academies, which met the need in the eigh- 
teenth century, had strangely decayed. They would not, 
even if they had survived, have met the needs of the 
secularists. An opposition composed of so many elements 
could adopt only one solution, the exclusion of theology 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  106 NEW TYPES OF EDUCATION [cH. 
altogether from the university which they desired. This 
was a peculiarly British solution. Elsewhere, save where 
secularists are in the majority, there are either separate 
universities for different persuasions, or two denominational 
faculties of theology in the same university, or faculties 
in which two or more denominations consent to sink their 
differences. The last solution is now-a-days becoming 
popular in Great Britain; but, whereas now our tendency 
is to harmonise differences, then it was to emphasise them. 
The opposition were anxious therefore to found a university 
in London from which theology should be excluded, and 
in which of course there should be complete equality as 
regards appointment to the secular chairs. To-day the 
second point would be taken for granted; and the opposi- 
tion to the exclusion of theology would be based on the 
very opposite grounds, namely, that it is desirable that 
the future clergy should mix with men destined for other 
professions and with men holding other beliefs. In those 
days isolation was regarded as essential for the tender 
plant of orthodoxy. The new University College was 
opened in 1827 by the Duke of Sussex, ever a liberal in 
educational matters; but even Arnold denounced ‘that 
godless institution in Gower Street,’ and some of the 
Nonconformists, including the headmaster of Mill Hill, 
shared his opinion. 
But the Church soon saw that the new college fulfilled 
other purposes than disseminating unorthodox views. It 
taught subjects which could not be found in the curriculum 
of the universities and public schools; it was incomparably 
cheaper and brought education to the student’s very doors. 
In self-defence these attractions must not be allowed to 
lure the sheep from the fold. King’s College was founded 
in 1828, and was soon housed in the Strand. University 
College had, however, been intended to become a university. 
A compromise was reached, and a charter was given in 
1836 to a federal university, which should consist of 
University and King’s Colleges and of any other institu- 
tions which should be founded to provide education of 
a university type.
-P-A-G-E-121

At its institution London was meant to be a real teaching 
university. Events, however, took a different turn. In- 
stitutions were admitted which were hardly of university 
calibre, and the certificates of study required for presenta- 
tion of students for examination lost their value. Colleges 
sprang up in different parts of the country which were 
anxious to prepare for a university degree, and in 1858 
the reactionary step was taken of awarding the degrees 
solely on examination. This lapse must not make us 
forget that the two original colleges were all the time doing 
real university work, and that the ideal of scientific re- 
search probably won earlier recognition in University 
College than in any British institution. We have now 
reached a point where a more detailed examination of the 
scientific influence on education is needed.

  CHAPTER V 
THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 
HE first movement for the recognition of the import- 
ance of scientific research had taken place at the 
beginning of the seventeenth century. Its herald was 
Bacon. It was followed by efforts to introduce teaching 
about natural phenomena into schools. The movement 
proved abortive, and a century and a half passed before 
it was renewed with any serious prospect of success. It is 
important to examine the reasons for the failure of the 
earlier movement if we are to understand why it was that 
the teaching of natural science first became possible at the 
period which we have now reached. 
Let us take our stand for a moment in the year 1648. 
We might well have thought that the knowledge of the 
natural world had made great strides. In mathematics 
the spread of the Arabic notation had made arithmetical 
computation comparatively easy, algebra had become 
known to Western Europe, trigonometry had been estab- 
lished a century before by Miiller’s table of sines, decimals 
had been invented in 1586 and logarithms in 1614. In 
astronomy, the science most dependent on mathematics, 
Kepler’s results published in 1609 and 1619 had made for 
the acceptance of the theory of the Solar system which 
Copernicus had put forward in 1543. In the more observa- 
tional sciences, the blind following of Aristotle was yielding 
to observation and experiment. All Europe knew how 
large and small stones had been dropped from the leaning 
tower of Pisa to settle the question whether the larger and 
heavier would fall more quickly. Scientific instruments 
were constantly being invented—the telescope, microscope 
(x608), thermometer (1620), and barometer (1643). Mech- 
anics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and light had become 
established branches of knowledge. The force of magnetism

had been discovered by Gilbert (1600), and in a different 
domain Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood 
(1628) had laid the foundation of modern physiology. 
Yet the possibilities of making natural science a branch 
of school education were by no means as rosy as this list 
might suggest. There were no scientific societies or 
scientific periodicals. It was hard even for one investigator 
to learn what another was doing, and almost impossible 
for the general public to know that anything was being 
‘done at all; and there was no body of expert opinion to 
discriminate between the discoverer and the quack. Books 
on the possibility of reaching the moon were taken seriously, 
while Gilbert was set aside even by Bacon as an impostor. 
Bacon was almost the only man who had a clear idea as 
to the methods by which scientific research would progress 
in the future, and even he held a very mechanical view of 
the inductive process. He regarded it as a method almost 
as easily reducible to rule as the syllogistic method which 
preceded it. The educational innovators who believed 
themselves to be his followers—Hartlib, Petty, Dury, 
Comenius, and the like—did indeed realise the need of 
research, but as a body they seem to have thought that 
they had lighted on an instrument which would have done 
its work in some fifty or a hundred years’ time and that, 
even before it had made all dark places bright, they could 
forthwith proceed to teach a systematic exposition of the 
universe. ‘“‘Pansophia” was but a new scholasticism. We 
have merely to read the headings of the chapters in 
Comenius’s text-book of Physics to see that the teaching 
of “natural philosophy” in the schools of the seventeenth 
century would have been radically unscientific. It would 
have taught nothing of method, it would have given more 
false information than true, and it would have annexed to 
the sphere of authority the one domain which, by its 
neglect in schools, was left free from its domination. 
Mathematics, however, was ripe for inclusion in the 
school curriculum; it found a definitely organised body of 
principles capable of being so taught that the pupil had 
full scope for the use of his intelligence. Whereas natural

philosophy would at that date have tended to produce an 
attitude of passive receptivity, mathematics would have 
promoted active thought. For no single branch of experi- 
mental and non-mathematical science had advanced beyond 
its beginnings, and the teaching of such science would 
have been the teaching of smatterings. The text-books 
would probably have been Pliny and the other ancient 
writers enumerated by Vives and Milton, and what little 
recent research there was could easily be taught to the 
sixth standard of an elementary school. . 
When we pass on to 1830, what a change do we find! 
Chemistry, in the seventeenth century still associated with 
the black art, has entered on a new career with Priestley’s 
discovery of oxygen in 1784. Geology has sprung into 
being; the order in which the sedimentary rocks were 
deposited has been determined; the classificatory stage is 
making way for the explanatory as it is realised what 
immense effects can be produced by the steady operation 
of minute processes over enormous periods. Botany and 
zoology indeed cannot be said to have entered on the 
explanatory stage till the publication of Darwin’s Origin 
of Species in 1859, but there was a vast difference between 
the work of Jussieu and Cuvier and the fairy tales which 
were told in the name of “‘natural history” at the time of 
the Renaissance. The progress of physiology had made 
medicine something more than a dangerous double-edged 
tool. Electricity had been discovered. Still, it must be 
confessed that even in 1830 mathematics and its astronomi- 
cal and physical applications were still far ahead of the 
non-mathematical branches of science. 
While the sequence of actual discoveries is fairly well 
known, it is less commonly recognised that the advent of 
each new science meant an addition to our ideas of scientific 
method. Though existing sciences might have worked out 
their methods so well that their students could in six’ 
months pass through centuries of scientific discovery, yet 
the best exponents of a new science would still for several 
generations be groping for a method. So-long as mathe- 
matics had the field. almost to itself, men’s ideas of scientific
-P-A-G-E-125
  v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT III 
method were almost entirely deductive. For, though 
astronomy involved observation and physics experiment, 
the work which tried the investigator's mettle consisted 
in the mathematical and deductive calculations involved 
in verifying the hypothesis. Kepler, Descartes and Newton 
are the scientific men of genius in the seventeenth century. 
But the rise of chemistry involved an emphasis on an 
entirely different attitude of mind; initiative was now 
displayed in devising experiments which would isolate 
a particular phenomenon not merely in thought but in the 
physical world of things. Geology was different again. 
Here genius was shown in the invention of hypotheses; 
the hypotheses occurred only to the investigator who could 
hold vast bodies of evidence in one grasp of his mind; and 
they were tested by seeing how far they explained all the 
known facts. For the time being the biological sciences 
called mainly for a perfection of the power of punctilious 
observation. The truth of the doctrine of the relativity 
of scientific method is perhaps best realised if we think of 
the sciences which are hardly yet out of the groping stage, 
such as anthropology and meteorology. The sciences which 
deal with the past history of man, as geology deals with 
the past history of the surface of the Earth, illustrate it 
particularly well. Attempts to explain the growth of 
languages, mythology, religious and social institutions, 
were in the second half of the nineteenth century almost 
in the same tentative condition as many of the physical 
sciences in the first half of the seventeenth, and it was 
possible in this sphere for such speculations as the sun- 
myth theory to obtain general recognition. It is true that, 
as a science advances, it may lose some of its peculiarities 
of method; there is now a physical chemistry and a chemi- . 
cal biology, and, since the discovery of radium emanations, 
there is beginning to be an evolutionary chemistry; but 
the approximation is never complete. 
There is of course a sense in which all scientific reasoning 
is of one general type. There are certain tools which every 
science applies more or less—observation, experiment, 
statistics, mathematical processes, hypothesis and verifica-

tion. These tools are used to do two main types of work, 
deductive and inductive reasoning. But in the case of each 
separate science researchers have to learn how much of the 
work each tool will do, at what stage in the collection of 
evidence hypotheses may profitably be formed, what scope 
is afforded for experiment, how the complexity of causes 
and effects is to be disentangled. No man could by the 
study of Mill’s or any other canons of induction develop 
the chemical or the geological or the biological sense. 
Sometimes perhaps a guiding principle in the technique of 
a particular science is run to death. The layman has a 
suspicion that this has occasionally happened with the 
geological principle of never explaining by crustal move- 
ments anything which can be conceivably due to the action 
of water or ice. But the exceptions only prove the rule 
that the expert in any science has acquired an added sense 
which tells him how to use his own tools. 
Perhaps the very diversity of the subjects discovered by 
the general term “natural science” was one of the chief 
obstacles to the demand for the inclusion of science in the 
school curriculum. The different branches involved so 
many different methods, gavesucha very different training, 
and based their claims to inclusion on such very different 
grounds that the general public was perplexed. The story 
of the struggle of science for admission to places of higher 
education is generally told in the form of a record of a 
campaign between scientific enlightenment and classical 
obscurantism. This method of writing certainly gives the 
actual incidents of the struggle, in much the same way as 
the despatches of war correspondents give the separate 
incidents of a battle. It is probably more picturesque; the 
account of a hand to hand combat between Huxley and 
the bishop of Oxford gives scope for descriptive power. 
But it is possible that, as in the case of a war, the real 
explanation of the success or failure of the combatants is 
only to be discovered by examining how far there existed 
unity of command among their respective general staffs. 
And we think that such an examination would show that 
from 1830 to 1870 the cause of science was represented by
-P-A-G-E-127
  vj THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 13 
a number of distinct armies whose leaders were in no agree- 
ment as to the reasons why they thought science should be 
taught, what should be included under the term, to whom 
it should be taught, or what were the right methods of 
teaching it. 
At the beginning of the century the only representatives 
of the scientific as distinct from the humanistic side of 
studies at the universities were the mathematicians; they 
alone represented the only side of scientific knowledge 
which had a long tradition behind it; and we might have 
expected them to have been the first to attack the classical 
monopoly in the schools. Indeed the neglect of mathe- 
, matics was.a much more striking evidence of the extent 
to which the schools had lagged behind the progress of 
modern thought than the total absence of such a new 
subject as chemistry. At Cambridgé mathematics was in 
so dominant a position that no candidate could take the 
classical tripos till he had obtained mathematical honours. 
The interest of the intellectual world in mathematical 
studies is shown by the number of articles on them in the 
Edinburgh Review, which astonishes the reader of the 
present day who is not accustomed to see such topics 
treated outside the pages of distinctly scientific journals. 
We may well begin therefore by noting the attacks on the 
university mathematicians and the position which they 
themselves took up. 
In 1805 and again in 1830, the Edinburgh Reviewers, 
who were ioth to miss an opportunity of criticising the 
English universities, took up the question of their treat- 
ment of mathematics. The charges against the two 
universities were different; the fault of Oxford was that 
it neglected mathematics altogether, that of Cambridge 
that it clung to old-fashioned geometrical methods in 
preference to more modern analytic methods; but in both 
cases the result was a failure to produce original mathe- 
maticians whose work would compare with their continental 
contemporaries. Copleston’s reply on behalf of Oxford to 
the earlier attack, and still more the fact that it. was 
regarded by his fellow Oxonians as a masterly vindication

  II4 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT (cH. 
of the University, is a striking evidence how profoundly 
the Oxford tutor of those days was out of touch with the 
intellectual progress of his age. Whewell’s line of defence 
on behalf of Cambridge at the time of the second attack 
was of a very different character. Many of his views appear 
old-fashioned at the present day, but he has at least a 
coherent theory of university education and is not averse 
from change as such. 
Whewell wrote at a time when murmurs of the coming 
storm were beginning to be heard but no eminent exponent 
of the scientific demand had arisen. There was a vague 
desire to make education more “practical.” Liebig had 
introduced chemistry into the German university of 
Giessen in 1825. The British Association had been founded 
in 1831. Men were working hard to found the new sciences. 
The connection of science with industry was for the first 
time being recognised. Working men were crying out even 
more than the leaders of industry for instruction in the 
new learning. Articles, letters, and speeches were suggesting 
that the material of education should be changed, though 
no book had yet been written to set forth the new ideas, 
nor had anyone really thought out what form the new 
education should take. ’ : 
Whewell, however, the champion of the mathematicians, 
goes a very small way in support of changes in the curri- 
culum. Like all educationalists of his day he approaches 
the question from the point of view of giving a logical 
training to the mind. He is quite ready to admit that the. 
universities should prepare certain of their students to be 
the future researchers in chemistry, geology, and biology. 
But he declares that “habits of thought must be formed 
among other subjects,’”’ though, when formed, “they may 
well be employed on these'.’’ He believes, in short, that 
persons who are to build up the new sciences on sound lines 
must be prepared by studying those which have already 
reached a high degree of organisation. The value of the 
older mathematical sciences in giving this training depends, 
he holds, on the methods employed in studying them.

v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 115 
Analytic mathematics only makes mathematicians, the 
study of geometrical mathematics makes reasoners. 
Analytic methods are mechanical: a result comes out, but 
you have not thought it out; “we dismiss from our minds 
altogether the conceptions of the things which the symbols 
represent,” ‘“‘the steps of the process are not acts of 
thought,” “we are carried along as in a railroad carriage?.”’ 
They afford no training—or a bad training—for the 
ordinary affairs of life®. “If we can only have analytic 
mathematics in our system of education, we have little 
reason to wish to have in it any mathematics at all%.”’ 
The following is his description of what mathematics, 
studied along the right lines should do. ‘‘ We are in that 
study concerned with long trains of reasoning in which 
each link hangs from all the preceding. The language 
contains a constant succession of short and rapid references 
to what has been proved already; and it is justly assumed 
that each of these brief movements helps the reasoner 
forwards in a course of infallible certainty and security. 
Each of these hasty glances must possess the clearness of 
intuitive evidence and the certainty of mature reflection; 
and yet must leave the reasoner’s mind entirely free to 
turn instantly to the next point of his progress” : hence, he 
argues, comes the success of mathematics in having trained 
so many eminent lawyers.’’* He interprets the whole 
history of the development of human thought from Thales 
onwards as showing that, where the exact sciences were 
honoured, there progress was made; but, whenever they 
were subordinated to speculative systems, there followed 
stagnation. Looking around the Europe of his own day, 
he sees the greatest cause for alarm in the fact that Ger- 
many seems to be dominated by metaphysicians. ‘‘ Those 
who are universally allowed to be the greatest philosophers 
of our own day in the German universities, Hegel and 
Schelling, cannot understand that Newton went further 
than Kepler had gone in physical astronomy and despise

Newton’s optical doctrines in comparison with the vague 
Aristotelian dogmas of Géthe respecting colours.’ Some- 
times Whewell’s language might be interpreted by modern 
educationalists as inculcating a belief in authority. ‘‘The 
critical system seems to me to be properly addressed, not 
to students who are undergoing education, but to philo- 
sophers who have been already completely educated” ; 
“nor can I believe that to put young men in such a position 
at the period of their lives when they ought to be quietly 
forming their minds for future action can have any other 
result than to fill them with a shallow conceit of their own 
importance?.” But it is not to authority in any bad sense 
that he wishes the learner to yield, but to the force of 
proof. He wishes to train the mind in subjects where 
conclusions can be subjected to undeniable tests, in order 
that he may really feel the nature of truth and may know 
that facts cannot be argued into being other than they 
really are. Had not Whewell an intuition of the danger 
into which Germany has been led by prematurely com- 
mitting research in subjects where conclusions are not 
easily tested to persons in whose minds the feeling of truth 
has not been firmly planted? And had the new sciences 
yet reached a stage where by themselves and without a 
preliminary gymnastic of mathematics and physics they 
could plant this feeling? Would a man whose studies had 
consisted in learning and accepting the recent discoveries 
of elementary chemistry and classificatory biology, in 
observing and memorising the parts of the human frame, 
and in hearing lectures on the contending hypotheses of 
opposing geological schools, have been a competent judge 
whether a hypothesis was or was not proved? And, tilla 
man can judge of the hypotheses of others, is he fit to form 
hypotheses of his own? If it be replied that it is only by form- 
ing hypotheses of your own that you can learn to pronounce 
judgment on those of others, there is much force in the 
contention; but, if you try to form them upon a subject- 
matter where experts differ, how can you tell whether 
you are learning how to form them rightly? It would

appear that, so long as any subject is in its infancy, its 
exponents must begin by studying more advanced subjects 
and as wide a range as possible of these subjects, so that 
they do not confuse the special methods of each subject 
with the general principles which determine whether a 
proposition is proved or not. 
Whewell’s programme consisted (1) in teaching mathe- 
matics at school by practical methods'—he suggests a 
syllabus in mensuration; (2) in making mechanics and 
hydrostatics compulsory in the early stages of the uni- 
versity course?; (3) in restricting the growth in the number 
of university examinations which were beginning to crush 
out the voluntary pursuit of side-tracks, and in restoring 
the importance of college tutorial work*; (4) in studying 
the older branches of science historically and reading 
accounts of discoveries by the original discoverers, such 
as Newton‘, and in asking questions in the tripos on the 
difficulties which those discoverers had met in the course 
of their researches and the ways in which they had over- 
come them®; (5) in introducing some way through the 
course optional college lectures on what he calls the “‘ pro- 
gressive” sciences, in order to stimulate the mature student 
of real intellectual tastes by the sight of little-explored 
regions in which he could exercise his talents®; and (6) in 
establishing a post-graduate tripos in these sciences for 
those who wished to continue the study of them’. 
Reform is often brought about not by men with the 
widest views who see many sides of a question, but by 
enthusiasts who see one side only—the side which pre- 
ceding generations have neglected—and work for it heart 
and soul; as, for instance, Rousseau, the most unbalanced 
of educational writers, was also the most effective. Now 
Whewell was a better judge of a good education, of the 
possibilities which various subjects possessed for giving it,

and of the methods of teaching which would bring out 
those possibilities, than many later scientific partisans; 
but it is doubtful whether such discriminating moderation 
would have advanced the cause of science far, even though 
the establishment of the Natural Sciences Tripos at Cam- 
bridge in 1851 and of the honours school at Oxford in 1853 
preceded the main period of agitation. But the fact that 
science had to enlist less thoughtful partisans in order to 
win success was partly responsible for the uneducational 
methods by which it was at first taught. 
George Combe, the earliest of these partisans, was not 
really a scientific man at all. Self-educated, he was 
attracted by the phrenological ideas of the German 
Spurzheim. Phrenology at this period had a great attrac- 
tion for a certain type of mind, because it appeared to offer 
a clear and simple materialistic explanation of human 
action and to bring it within the operation of laws which 
physical science could readily investigate. On’ the basis 
of phrenology as a physiology of the mind a scheme of 
education was to be constructed as the mind’s diet. The 
idea harmonised well with the prevalent educational theory 
which regarded the mind as divided into a number of 
faculties ; for it was these faculties which the phrenologists 
believed that they had located in particular parts of the 
brain. Psychology was in those days in the pre-scientific 
stage through which all sciences have passed, and attempts 
to build education upon it were like building upon the 
sand. The present prejudice of old-fashioned teachers 
against it is a survival from those days. All writers of that 
period repeated Pestalozzi’s dictum that education con- 
sisted in the “ harmonious development of all the faculties,” 
which to the phrenologist meant all parts of the brain. But 
Combe was no clear thinker and from an ultra-disciplin- 
arian theory he somehow reached an informational system 
of practice. His theory was expressed in the sentence, “We 
should train to do more than to know. In framing books 
for schools it would be well to ask ourselves, ‘What does 
this book teach people to do?’”? Theoretically then he 
1 William Jolly, Education as developed by George Combe, p. 13. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 119 
condemns the mere receiving of information; indeed his 
ground of attack on language teaching is that this is all 
itis. “Language, apart from its applications, is a collection 
of mere unmeaning arbitrary sounds?.” But like the 
realists of the seventeenth century, whose educational 
axioms are excellent, he does not seem to see their bearing 
on problems of curriculum. Logically he should have 
admitted no subject without facing the question, Can 
school children manipulate this subject? Practically he 
seems only concerned with the value of the knowledge 
which is conveyed by a subject on the tacit assumption 
that it is mastered. He therefore demands the subordina- 
tion of the “instrumental” subjects, by which he means 
those which teach us how to use the tools of thought, to 
those which give “positive” knowledge. As with the 
German Philanthropinists, physiology is to be taught 
because bodily health is desirable, phrenology because 
mental health is desirable, ethics to make us good indi- 
viduals, sociology to make us good citizens (not history, 
because it is a record of cruelty”), and various branches 
of science to make us good workpeople. A smattering of 
everything is of course a logical outcome of the theory of 
a harmonious (interpreted as equal) development of all 
the faculties; but the idea of developing them by practice 
seems to have been lost in the attempt to secure their 
equality, since in no one of them would the pupil ever reach 
the stage at which he would be anything but a recipient. 
After adumbrating his views in the Phrenological Journal 
in 1827 and amplifying them in lectures to the Edinburgh 
Philosophical Society from 1830 to 1840, he was able in 
1848 to establish Williams’s Secular School in Edinburgh 
with an encyclopaedic curriculum; but, though it started 
with éclat, it collapsed in 1854. It was, however, imitated 
by other “‘secular schools” in various towns, as was not 
unnatural at a time when facilities for higher elementary 
education were almost non-existent and when those for 
lower secondary education were miserably poor; but the 
schools were mostly ephemeral. Combe’s strong point was 
1 Op. cit. p. 25. 2 Op. cit. p. 109.
-P-A-G-E-134
120 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT [cH. 
what we may call the political side of education. He did 
good work in emphasising that the extension of the 
franchise in Great Britain would be a blessing or a curse 
according as the masses were educated or not, and that 
an illiterate proletariat might ruin the rising democracy 
of America. His aims—the inculcation of the social sense 
and a feeling of responsibility, the attraction of thoughtful 
men into political lifet, and the recognition that some 
subjects which give the idea of causation must be included 
in the curriculum’—were excellent. The speeches and 
articles which he continued to produce all his life had 
a stirring effect; but he had not sufficient practical 
acquaintance with the process of education to be a 
guide as to the means by which it was possible to 
effect ends which we have now all come to recognise as 
desirable. 
A much more permanent effect was produced when the 
demand for the teaching of science was. voiced by a man 
of recognised intellectual prestige, Herbert Spencer, in a 
series of articles issued between 1854 and 1859 and after- 
wards published in book form. But it was Spencer’s repu- 
tation and not his arguments which produced the effect. 
They display Spencer’s weakness, not his strength. His 
strength lay in the extent of his knowledge, especially on 
matters which at that time were little studied, and in his 
power of inventing new theories. His weakness lay in a lack 
of judgment as to what constitutes proof and a sacrifice of 
logic to pre-formed opinions. A mind which would have 
excelled in the scholastic controversies of the Middle Ages 
was filled with the scientific knowledge of the nineteenth 
century and was set the task of supporting a philosophic 
system by means of facts supplied by the natural sciences. 
A bitter assailant of authority, he won his educational 
reputation on the strength of the authority which the mass 
of Englishmen allow to a man of science on any matter which 
he discusses. Justas his political writing does little more than 
give a philosophical flavour to the current individualistic 
tenets of the Manchester school, and his ethical writing than 
1 Op. cit. pp. 181-184. 2 Ob. cit. p. 40, p P. a 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT I2I 
suggesting an evolutionary basis for current Utilitarianism, 
so his educational writing did little more than voice the 
contemporary views of English Pestalozzians on method, 
of Utilitarians on curriculum, and of the followers of 
Rousseau on discipline. Yet his essays were long regarded 
as possessing weight when the contemporary writers from 
whom he had culled his educational views were forgotten. 
Milton’s Tvactate is perhaps the only other pamphlet or 
article which has been regarded as an educational classic 
by virtue of the author’s reputation in other fields. 
There is little or nothing in the articles which had not 
been said already by Combe or Wyse or other contem- 
porary writers, and there is very little except the fourth 
article, on physical education, which will bear criticism. 
The first three deal with curriculum, method, and discipline. 
Spencer is satisfied that he has solved the problem of 
curriculum when he has answered the question, “What 
knowledge is of most worth?” He does not tell us whose 
knowledge it is or to whom it is of worth. He commits a 
well-known logical fallacy when he proves that it is of 
value to the community that there should be some persons 
who know each science and imagines that he has thereby 
proved that it is of value to each individual man that he 
should know them all. He does not even stop to enquire 
if, how far, and at what age a school child is capable of 
profiting by the physiology which preserves life directly, 
by the whole cycle of physical sciences which, as forming 
the basis of industrial processes, preserve it indirectly, by 
the psychology which enables parents to bring up their 
children properly, by the comparative sociology which is 
to make enlightened citizens, and by the anatomy and 
astronomy which are to make us spend our leisure nobly 
in the criticism of art from the standpoint of its scientific 
accuracy. When he proclaims the necessity of learning 
all the sciences, he has not a word to suggest whether he 
has in mind the captains of industry, the foremen, the 
skilled artisans, or the unskilled workmen, nor does he 
hint at the difficulty of carrying out his programme in the 
elementary school, which pupils of that day commonly  
-P-A-G-E-136
  122 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT [cH. 
left at twelve. As he could not altogether ignore the pre- 
valent belief that the directly useful subjects are not the 
best for training—in other words that it is necessary to 
feed beginners on the intellectual milk which they can 
digest rather than on the strong meat of later stages—the 
champion of induction brushes the difficulty aside with the 
a priori assumption that “it is contrary to the beautiful 
economy of Nature” that one subject should be useful as 
knowledge and another as discipline. A still more remark- 
able betrayal of inductive philosophy occurs when he 
places history on the index and, like Combe, wishes to 
substitute for it an abstract course in comparative sociology, 
of which the laws, if true, can only be based on the recorded 
facts of history. But facts have an awkward way of up- 
setting a priori theories, and the political doctrinaire does 
not care for an uncensored study of them. 
When he comes to deal with methods, Spencer finds his 
hands tied by the curriculum which he has already laid 
down. It is useless to assert that the “order in which the 
faculties” develop must be followed as regards methods 
of teaching when you have ignored that order in your 
choice of subjects. True, he never tells us what the order 
of development is, but we can hardly believe that he 
thought it to be of such a kind as would enable children 
under twelve to employ their critical powers on the ab- 
stractions of comparative sociology. The only justification 
for Spencer’s chapter on curriculum would be that it was” 
intended for university students: but in that case why did 
he follow it up by a chapter on method which could only 
apply to infants? For the second chapter gives us no 
concrete examples of teaching beyond the infant stage— 
presumably because the English Pestalozzians from whom 
he takes them were mainly concerned with that stage. 
The article on discipline is a restatement of Rousseau’s 
theory of the discipline of natural consequences, presum- 
ably handed down through intermediate sources, since 
Spencer declared that, when he wrote it, he had not read 
the Emile. A fundamental ambiguity deprives his version 
of the theory of all real meaning. At the outset he uses
-P-A-G-E-137
  v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 123 
the phrase “natural discipline” as meaning the discipline 
which comes from the laws of inanimate nature, as equi- 
valent to Rousseau’s discipline des choses, which is opposed 
to the discipline of persons. But, having committed him- 
self to the assertion that these consequences are “‘ propor- 
tionate to the offence” and therefore just, he finds himself 
in difficulties. The discipline ‘‘of things” often punishes 
a small act of carelessness with death. He therefore tries 
to escape from the meshes by changing the meaning of the 
word “natural.” It now comes to mean “such as we 
should reasonably expect,’’ even where reasonable expecta- 
tions would point to the displeasure of parents or teachers 
and not to a reaction of inanimate “‘things” at all. But 
he has now entangled himself worse than ever; for what 
is to exclude from our reasonable expectations the natural 
reactions of Dr Keate or of the policeman? So“ reasonable” 
has to be explained as “‘sensible,’”’ and the whole theory of 
natural consequences has come to mean that parents and 
teachers ought to act in such a way as to produce the right 
effect on the child! He does indeed give some unexception- 
able instances of sensible behaviour towards children; but 
they have nothing to do with the laws of inanimate nature, 
but seem to be instances of a sound principle of punish- 
ment which was afterwards enunciated by Gilbert and 
Sullivan. 
Underlying the whole argument is a confusion of thought 
which enabled Spencer to convince himself that some moral 
quality attaches to that operation of physical laws whereby 
effect follows on cause. Actions, he holds, are wrong if 
they cause pain; natural laws secure that the pain follows, 
and there is the punishment! But what if it is A who sins 
and B who suffers the pain? Buddhists and Greek trage- 
dians might hold that the punishment always ultimately 
recoils on the transgressor, because they allowed for 
agencies more moral than physical laws; but could Spencer 
hold that physical laws will bring all transgressions home 
to roost? No; acts are wrong which cause pain to others, 
but a child will be deterred from them on that account only 
if he has first become unselfish, and Spencer never probes 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  I24 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT [cH. 
to the heart, where unselfishness is to be found. He knows 
only of motives which appeal to enlightened selfishness. 
This implicit denial of altruistic motives is the worst point 
in Spencer’s theory. Not that his training really provides 
even for the self-regarding virtues; for, if we were to wait 
for Nature’s punishments for gluttony and sensuality, the 
harm would be done years before any indication of the 
punishment were foreseen. Spencer seems to think it is 
a merit in Nature that she never gives warning of her 
punishments. Rather, Nature is non-moral and Man has 
to step in with a more merciful justice. 
In considering Spencer’s article on discipline we have 
strayed rather far from the progress of science to a place 
in education; but it has been already pointed out that the 
scientific movement was closely bound up with other 
tendencies in nineteenth century education, and we cannot 
understand why science commended itself to some persons 
and roused the antagonism of others unless we see the 
company which it kept. If old-fashioned teachers suspected 
science of producing that kind of non-moral outlook which 
we have since seen fully developed in the Prussian intellec- 
tual caste, Spencer’s third article was not calculated to 
allay their suspicions. 
Spencer’s claim for science was primarily utilitarian. 
But almost at the same time a plea for the teaching of 
science was put forward in a quarter from which it could 
hardly have been expected and by a writer who appealed 
to a totally different body of admirers. Ruskin, in a short 
appendix to the Stones of Venice, discusses briefly the 
subject-matter of a curriculum; and, though brief, his 
six pages present a coherent theory. His aim may be 
summed up in the one word “Outlook”: the knowledge 
which is worth having is that which determines our mode 
of regarding life, our attitude to the universe and to our 
fellow-beings, the aims which we set before us, and to a 
large extent the sources from which we draw our happiness. 
The primary defect in the current disciplinarian conception 
of education was that it aimed only at producing a capable 
1 Vol. m1, Appendix 7.
-P-A-G-E-139
  
v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 125 
mind, but did not provide that mind with material on 
which to exercise its capacity. Ruskin’s exposure of this 
defect was primarily directed against universities; but it 
is probable that, however true it may have been in his 
own undergraduate days, the progress of the newer human- 
ism was fast making it untrue of contemporary Oxford. 
The schools, however, in spite of Arnold, were still devoted 
to the worship of form, and few of their pupils, save those 
who afterwards took honours at the universities, would be 
led to think seriously on political or social questions, on 
the new vision of the material universe which geology and 
biology were opening up, or on the religious questions 
which were perplexing the minds of thoughtful men. From 
the point of view of outlook Ruskin declares that an edu- 
cated person “ought to know three things; first, where he 
is; second, where he is going; thirdly, what he ought to do 
under the circumstances. First, where he is: that is to 
say, what sort of a world he has got into: how large it is; 
what kind of creatures live in it and how; what it is made 
of, and what may be made of it. Secondly, where he is 
going”; that is to say, religion. And “thirdly, what he 
had best do under those circumstances; that is to say, what 
faculties he possesses; what are the present state and wants 
of mankind; what is his place in society; and what are the 
readiest means in his power of attaining happiness and 
diffusing it.” 
Ruskin’s exposition of the failure of the existing educa- 
tional system to produce “educated men” capable of 
understanding contemporary events on the Continent or 
social movements at home is excellent, but it does not 
concern our present purpose. On the neglect of science, 
with which we are here concerned, he says: “Our present 
European system of so-called education despises natural 
history.’ Even on the Continent the “result is that, unless 
a man’s natural instincts urge him to the pursuit of the 
physical sciences too strongly to be resisted, he enters life 
utterly ignorant of them.’’ “The main mischief of it is 
that it leaves the greater number of men without the 
natural food which God intended for their intellects. For

126 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT (CH. 
one man who is fitted for the study of words, fifty are fitted 
for the study of things, and were intended to have a per- 
petual, simple and religious delight in watching the processes 
or admiring the creatures of the natural universe. Deprived 
of this source of pleasure, nothing is left to them but 
ambition or dissipation; and the vices of the upper classes 
of Europe are, I believe, chiefly to be attributed to this 
single cause.”’ Here is a line of thought which would prob- 
ably sound strange to most scientific men; it has little 
connection with the motives which have actually led to 
the admission of science to a place in higher education; but 
it has had much to do with the introduction of nature- 
study, as distinct from natural science, into our elementary 
schools. Ruskin’s concern is with the aesthetic and emo- 
tional rather than with the intellectual side of our nature, 
and he discovered what many scientific men failed to 
discover, that there is a mode of studying nature which 
appeals to the former just as there is a mode which appeals 
to the latter. With this mode of studying nature Art has 
close connections; and an artist of genius could not fail 
tosee them. Nature is the mother of Art, and nature-study 
is Art’s act of filial devotion. At the elementary stage we 
believe that drawing and nature-study are so closely allied 
as to be practically one subject and that a child will never 
truly love one without the other. If he loves natural 
objects he will wish to depict them; and he will see no 
beauty in his productions unless they are reproductions 
of the beauty of nature. 
However, nature-study is not natural science; nature- 
study belongs to that recreative side of. life which Herbert 
Spencer rated so low; while natural science is a rigorous 
discipline of the intellect. We do not expect to see as 
the motto inscribed on the entrance to a laboratory the 
well-known lines: 
«He prayeth best who loveth best 
Both man and bird and beast,’’ 
though, to their honour, there are many biologists of whom’ 
it is true.
-P-A-G-E-141
  v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 127 
The real protagonist of the scientific cause, however, 
was T. H. Huxley. To many devotees of the old literary 
* subjects, his addresses must have revealed for the first 
time that hard scientific work may be a pleasure, that there 
is a satisfaction almost aesthetic in following a train of 
scientific reasoning, and that the solution of a problem 
yields a delight akin to that felt by the winner of a race. 
The utilitarian plea had indeed been overdone; many an 
opponent accepted the premise that the sciences had a 
greater marketable value than the humanities, and drew 
from it a conclusion precisely the opposite from that which 
was intended, namely that they were therefore ignoble 
and inferior. Huxley was not content with proving science 
to be useful; he proclaimed the grandeur of its subject- 
matter, the nobility of its quest, and the worth of the 
intellectual qualities which it developed. His addresses 
on this theme are no cold appeal to the intellect; indeed it 
would be difficult to preserve their flavour in a summary. 
The reader feels that he has been permitted to look into a 
noble mind, and his conviction that there is a value in 
what he has seen there is an act of intuition rather than 
of argument. 
Indeed the humanities themselves owe a great debt to 
Huxley. For not only did he show up the half truth of 
Pope’s old adage that “the proper study of mankind is 
man,” but he made out a strong case for a still more serious 
charge against the school classics of fifty years ago, that 
they were not a study of man after all. They were a study 
of language and style, but not of literature. The true 
humanities are literature, history, philosophy, and socio- 
logy; the classics at their best are only an introduction to 
these true humanities and at their worst are pure gerund- 
grinding. Nor are Greek and Latin the only avenues to 
the study of man. Huxley outlined a curriculum which 
should consist, in addition to natural science, of the theory 
of morals and of political and social life, the history of our 
own country with incidental geography, English literature 
together with translations of the greatest writings in 
foreign tongues, English composition, drawing, and either
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT [ene 
music or. painting’. Even now we doubt if any course of 
which natural science is the centre has attained Huxley’s 
ideals on the humanist side; but there is no doubt that, 
whereas the classical curriculum of Huxley’s time laid 
itself open to his criticisms, that of twenty years later 
achieved his aims more fully than any rival which has 
yet been discovered. An attack on a system often results 
in its improvement where the object was its destruction. 
We said that it is impossible to make a satisfactory 
abstract of Huxley’s writings. What follows is not an 
abstract of any particular essay, it does not reproduce his 
forms of expression, and it may not give the exact stress 
which he laid on each particular point. It is an attempt 
to run through the various functions of science which in 
different connections he brought to the fore. 
First, children should in the days of childhood make 
friends with Nature. They should love and admire. The 
instincts which draw them to her must be given play 
before they are atrophied by disuse. Familiarity will breed 
knowledge, knowledge curiosity, and curiosity observation. 
It was many years before much was done to realise this 
ideal. Modern nature-study is only about twenty years 
old, and much teaching which passes under the name is 
still a miserable fiasco. In the future it may be hoped that 
a love of nature will really be fostered by schools, though 
perhaps not in the class room, and it may exercise a vast 
moralising influence. In boarding-schools natural history 
societies have come to revive this natural taste, which it 
was feared that games had finally driven out, and there 
is reason to hope that in the future it will humanise many 
a life which would otherwise become a prey to sensuality 
or discontent, will restore the sense of beauty to a nation 
which is tending to estimate values in terms of cash, will 
implant the seeds of the scientific attitude, and will re- 
introduce the spirit of reverence into subjects which may 
otherwise sell wisdom captive for thirty pieces of silver into 
the land of industrial bondage. : 
Secondly, an acquaintance with the results of science 
1 Collected Essays, vol. 111, No. 7, Science and Art and Education.-
-P-A-G-E-143
  v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 129 
changes our whole outlook on the universe. Instead of 
regarding the Earth as the centre of a tiny world created 
six thousand years ago, we know it to be a speck in an 
abysmal star-strewn space, but a speck with a wondrous 
story stretching over myriads of years; and we know that 
each of its infinite species of plant and animal inhabitants 
has an ancestry which goes far back into the past, an 
ancestry of strange forms which lived in vanished marshes 
or on the shores of forgotten seas as strange as themselves. 
And all these things must be taken into account when we 
ask, What is our life, and whence? why is it, and what is 
its goal? 
Thirdly, the history of science is the history of the 
growth of the idea of causation and it may be that the 
study of science is essential in order to fix that idea in the 
minds of most human beings. Certainly no man who has 
not acquired this sense can be called educated. Legislators 
will only feel a sense of responsibility if they realise in- 
tensely, that, as is the sowing, so also is the harvest: the 
masses will recognise that hygiene is not a fad of sanitary 
inspectors only if they are accustomed to think in terms 
of immutable natural laws which will not yield to the 
customs or desires of man; in whatever sphere progress is 
to be substituted for conservatism, it is possible only when 
the change is seen to be no arbitrary preference of a school 
but is necessitated because Nature will only give us what 
we desire on condition that we seek it by the means that 
she lays down. 
Fourthly—and this is a position which needs very careful 
discussion, and to which we shall have to return later— 
Huxley claims that there is one universal method under- 
lying the methods of all the separate sciences. “The life, 
the fortune, and the happiness of every one of us, and, 
more or less, of those who are connected with us, depend 
upon our knowing something of the rules of a game in- 
finitely more difficult and complicated than chess....The 
chess-board is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of 
the universe, the rules of the game are what we call the 
laws of nature. The player on the other side is hidden from

us. We know that his play is always just and fair and 
patient. But also we know, to our cost, that he never 
overlooks a mistake or makes the smallest allowance for 
ignorance. To the man who plays well the highest stakes 
are paid with that sort of overflowing generosity with 
which the strong shows delight in strength. And one who 
plays ill is check-mated—without haste but without re- 
morse....Well, what I mean by Education is learning the 
rules of that mighty game}.”” 
Lastly, the crown of a scientific education is the capacity 
to conduct independent research. A few only may attain 
it; but progress depends on those few, and, through the 
neglect of science in its education, Great Britain was doing 
an amount of research absurdly small compared with that 
accomplished by Germany. With the chemists, such as 
Sir William Ramsay, the research argument seems ite have 
outweighed all the others. 
Huxley’s campaign was therefore directed to attain all 
objectives which his predecessors had attacked singly, and 
others besides. Such strategy involved a considerable 
widening of the battle front, though it had the advantage 
that success at any one point would probably facilitate 
subsequent stages of the operation against others. The 
first aim necessitated an assault on the Kindergarten, the 
infant school, preparatory school, and elementary school. 
If these positions were taken, this first objective would 
probably be reached, whether the secondary school and 
university remained in the hands of the humanists or 
passed into those of the scientists. The strategy on this 
part of the line was, however, hopelessly mismanaged. It 
was essential to success that nature-study, not elementary 
science, should conduct this part of the attack; and Huxley’s 
writings, as well as those of Ruskin and perhaps of 
Matthew Arnold, would suggest that this was what was 
proposed. Actually, physiography was the only unit of 
nature-study which was brought into action; the rest of 
nature-study was moved out of the line, not to reappear 
till the twentieth century; physiography actually obtained

v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 131 
a lodgment in the elementary school, where it found itself 
so isolated that it had to be withdrawn and reorganised 
as a section of geography. The motive for this mistake in 
strategy undoubtedly was that the scientists did not take 
the first aim as seriously as the remainder and believed 
that physics and chemistry would be better able to secure 
the next point in the line—the post-elementary annexes 
of the elementary school and the secondary school—if they 
could capture the upper standards of the elementary school. 
The unsuitability of these two sciences for effective work 
in the elementary zone was not recognised till after the 
failure of Armstrong’s attempt to secure success by arming 
them with the new weapon of heurism. 
The second, third, and fourth aims are all concerned with 
the age from twelve to nineteen. They have as their 
respective objects the widening of outlook, the creation of 
an idea of causality, and the development of sound habits 
of reasoning. But, though the teacher has in each case 
pupils of the same age, he will have to adopt different means 
to secure each of these three aims, and it was this problem 
which the advocates of science did not clearly present to 
themselves and which even now cannot be said to have 
been solved. 
The second aim, that of creating outlook, requires that 
the results of many sciences should be taught, but it does 
not necessitate a training in the methods of any one of 
them. In a word, it asks for “‘popular science.’”’ Popular 
astronomy extends our outlook in space, popular geology 
and popular biology in time: our whole mode of thinking 
is utterly different from that of pre-Copernican and pre- 
Darwinian man. The intensive study of one or two sciences, 
least of all of the two sciences which are now fashionable 
in schools, physics and chemistry, will not give this know- 
ledge. A real understanding of the means by which such 
knowledge was attained would involve a study far more 
protracted than is possible for the ordinary schoolboy. 
He may be told in very rough outline the kind of considera- 
tions which influenced the scientific discoverers—how the 
distances of the planets and consequently their velocities

were determined, how rocks containing certain fossils are 
always found below those containing others, how variations 
which increase adaptability to environment are found in an 
increasing series. A clever pupil will appreciate the charac- 
ter of the proof; but the average pupil probably does not 
reach even this stage; and not even the clever pupil can 
be said to be in possession of the evidence as a juryman is 
in possession of the evidence in a criminal trial, far less to 
be in the position either of the barrister who has worked 
it into shape or the judge who is an expert critic. In the 
main ‘it is a case of acceptance on authority; and the 
majority of pupils at the end of such popular courses will 
have scarcely any more idea of the reign of law than they 
had at the beginning. Hence the opponents of scientific 
teaching were somewhat contemptuous of any instruction 
which might be given in furtherance of this aim and the 
advocates of a scientific curriculum had an uneasy feeling 
that to lay stress on it might expose their subject to a 
suspicion of intellectual inferiority; and so it was allowed 
tacitly to drop out of the programme?, though, owing to 
the prevalence of confused thinking, it is probable that it 
is often regarded as one of the advantages to be gained 
from the study of ‘“‘science” even when “science” means 
elementary physics and chemistry. 
The third aim—the creation of an idea of causality— 
opens up a wide field of controversy. One feels about it, as 
about the second aim, that any conception of education 
which does not recognise its importance is lacking in an 
essential element. But many persons seem to acquire an 
idea of causality without any formal training in natural 
sciences. Their minds appear to be so attuned to that note 
that they vibrate to it whencesoever it reaches them. 
History, politics, economics, strategy, business, the every- 
1 This statement may at first sight appear to be an exaggeration, 
but we beg the reader to ask himself what specific provision was made 
in any school for teaching anything but a verbal smattering about, 
say, nebulae, the evidence of ice action (till geography took it over), 
the identification of local fossils, or the life of palaeolithic man, for 
thirty years after the introduction of physics and chemistry into 
schools.
-P-A-G-E-147

day affairs of life, all seem schools in which they may learn 
it. Itisits very universality which impresses them. Others 
seem never to acquire it even from natural science. The 
laboratory is to them a place where all experiments go 
wrong and Chance is king as much as elsewhere. The truth 
seems to be somewhat as follows. Common experience 
would suggest that events were divided into two classes, 
those where even babes and savages perceive uniformity, 
such as the sequence of day and night, and those which 
appear to be the sport of chance, such as the British weather. 
The effect on a flabby mind of a course, say, in chemistry 
is to convince it that the inside of a chemical laboratory 
may possibly have to be regarded as part of the domain 
of uniformity; but such a mind is not prone to generalisa- 
tion, conscious or unconscious, and continues to assign to 
the realm of Chance all else which it so assigned before 
the assumed course in chemistry. The early advocates of 
science did not realise that the majority of mankind may 
be born with minds of such a description: consequently we 
do not know even at the present day what proportion of 
pupils are really capable of thinking scientifically all round, 
after the study of a single branch of stience, or of several, 
and what proportion is incapable of ever properly forming 
the scientific habit of mind at all: hence we are still in the 
dark whether more science or whether none is what is 
needed for the majority. 
The fourth aim needs the most careful consideration of 
all. It must be carefully distinguished from the third. We 
do not suppose that even the stoutest opponents of the 
transference of mental attitudes from one subject-matter 
to another would deny that really educated persons recog- 
nise the universality of law; but the most scientific mind 
may go wrong as to what the particular laws are which 
are operative in a field with which he is not well acquainted. 
How far can training in some branches of science secure 
a less chance of coming to false conclusions in others? 
Earlier in the chapter we argued that the history of scientific 
discovery seems to show that there is not, in any sense 
which helps the pioneer in a new branch of science, a 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
    
134 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT [cH. 
uniform scientific method. A training in some other subject 
in which exact reasoning is needed will be of some assist- 
ance, but much modification in methods will be required 
as the enquirer proceeds further in the new subject. Five 
minutes spent with an archaeologist will convince you that 
there is an archaeological sense as much as there is a 
geological or a biological sense and that it can not be 
comprised in a set of formulae. A master mind like 
Huxley’s can to some extent, if one may use the expression, 
generalise such a sense. But can a fifth form boy? Ap- 
parently here again, as in the case of the formation of the 
idea of uniformity at all, the effect on one mind is limited 
in sphere to a particular subject-matter while its effect on 
another is wider in scope. To one man particular processes 
of scientific thinking may give a fuller appreciation of the 
lines of procedure which are involved in all searches after 
truth, to another they remain merely the tricks of one 
particular science. But, if this is granted, a further question 
arises. Is every branch of science equally fitted to produce 
this wider appreciation of the methods by which truth is 
attained? Huxley, without apparently realising to what 
corollaries his contention might commit him, answered in 
the affirmative. His answer was prompted by the charge 
of ‘“‘inexactitude” brought against his own speciality, the 
biological sciences, which implied that they were less fitted 
to produce the result than the mathematical sciences. 
Huxley does not really meet the point of this charge. He 
has no difficulty in showing that the particular facts of 
biology are beyond a doubt, and that some of these facts 
are established by experiment, that is by artificial isolation, 
as well as by observation. But the point which his oppo- 
nents intended to make was that the wide theories of 
biology cannot carry the same absolute conviction as the 
wide theories of astronomy, physics, or even chemistry. 
It is implied that, when the pupil cannot see the certainty 
of the conclusions so clearly that he cannot possibly think 
otherwise, he has to some extent to depend on the judg- 
ment of another: he is in part dependent on authority and 
to that extent lacks the “feel” how the thing becomes
-P-A-G-E-149
  vy] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 138 
certain. Hence he is at a loss when he is required to have 
this feeling of certainty in another case. Huxley has not 
disproved the position taken up, for instance, by Whewell 
at an earlier date, that students should be introduced to 
the less exact sciences through the portal of the more 
exact. A number of further questions suggest themselves. 
If Whewell was right, how far should the preliminary 
training be carried, if it is on the one hand to save the 
pupil from a careless attitude towards truth in the less 
exact sciences and yet on the other hand is to avoid the 
formation of a specialised physical or chemical demand for 
certainty which might be actually prejudicial in botany 
or zoology? Is it even certain that natural science in any 
of its branches is the best instrument with which to start 
the training of school pupils in the methods of scientific 
thinking? 
Thus, after considering the three aims which. would seem 
to dominate scientific teaching between the ages of twelve 
and twenty-one—the period of secondary schooling ‘and 
the lower stages of .a university course—we cannot feel 
that Huxley or any of his contemporaries had either 
estimated sufficiently the difficulties at any of the points 
of attack or considered the relations between one point of 
attack and another; and, though they succeeded in estab- 
lishing physics and chemistry within the enemy’s lines, 
it is doubtful how much nearer they came to their ultimate 
objectives. 
The fifth aim, the encouragement of research, immediately 
concerns only the highest stage of university work, but 
it has a very great bearing on procedure at the lower 
stages. Learning natural science means learning the ele- 
ments of research. It is unfortunate that the difference 
between the humanities and the sciences in this respect 
is too often forgotten. Fifty years ago the predominance 
of the humanities, and therefore of humanistic aims and 
methods, was so strong that it was hard to convince people 
that a scientific training means not the communication of 
the results of research, not a critical estimate of the re- 
searches of others, but learning how to research. To-day
-P-A-G-E-150
  136 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT {cH. 
the predominance of natural science is tending to make a 
training for research appear to be commensurate with 
education not only in science but in the humanities; in 
Germany it has apparently already done so. In reality 
there is an important difference in the rédle of research 
between the sciences and the humanities. In the human- 
ities, research may profit others but it is not their main 
educative value to the learner. Whereas in the sciences 
creativeness is but research carried to a high point, in the 
humanities the two things may be quite different. No man 
ever became a dramatist by discovering new facts about 
Shakespeare’s life or a poet by a comparative study of 
the metres of two languages. Even in history the good to 
the learner and to the world ultimately comes from tracing 
the connections between events, from evaluating them, 
and from the development of a social sense; the discovery 
of new facts is only a step in the process. If the humanities 
are taught solely with a view of training critics and pro- 
fessors, they will abandon the higher task of making men 
wise for the lower task of making them learned. This is 
the truth which needs emphasis to-day; but the place of 
research in science was what needed to be impressed on the 
men of fifty years ago. 
1859 is a memorable date in the history of science as it 
saw the publication of Darwin’s Ovigin of Species. It also 
witnessed the first grants from the State towards scientific 
education and the establishment of science degrees in 
London University. The leading actors are now all on the 
stage and the controversy has begun. Unfortunately it 
was too often carried on, not with a desire to see the strong 
points in opponents’ contentions, but simply to secure 
dialectical success. As if the odiwm paedagogicum was not 
enough, the odium theologicum must needs enter. Though 
the alliance between Aristotelianism and orthodoxy had 
set Catholicism and science in opposition in the days of 
the Renaissance, there had been no hostility in Protestant 
England during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 
Milton took care that the universe of Paradise Lost should 
be strictly reconcilable with Copernican astronomy;
-P-A-G-E-151
  v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 137 
Newton was devoutly religious; and educationalists at the 
close of the eighteenth century were constantly and sin- 
cerely urging that a study of the creation would inculcate 
a reverence for the Creator. Geology provoked the first 
cry of alarm; but as yet there was no panic. Indeed with 
a man like Charles Kingsley geology became an intrinsic 
part of his religion. But the joint monopoly of classics 
and Anglicanism at the two ancient universities tended to 
promote a separation. The future theologians drifted as 
a matter of course to Oxford and Cambridge and never 
made the acquaintance of science or its votaries. The 
sciences were left in outer darkness where they consorted 
with all varieties of unorthodoxy. Of course the division 
was not hard-and-fast; Mark Pattison was not a man of 
science and A. R. Wallace was not an opponent of religion. 
But in the mind of the ordinary bishop Science was repre- 
sented by the names of Darwin, Huxley and Spencer; and 
in the minds of this trio Charles Kingsley did not stand for 
a typical representative of orthodoxy. Enough passion had 
already been roused before 1859; the lightning-flash of the 
Origin of Species really cleared the air. The rapid acceptance 
of the evolutionary theory by scientific opinion made it 
obvious that, if orthodox science were to be pronounced 
heretical theology, educated men would be placed on the 
horns of an impossible dilemma. Temple, one of the small 
band of open-minded clergy who from the first accepted 
Darwinism, instead of suffering excommunication, lived 
to become Archbishop of Canterbury; and the odium theo- 
logicum was not handed on to the second generation. 
While controversialists were “taking the side of the 
angels” or of the monkeys instead of deciding the relative 
importance of the various aims which were being urged for 
the teaching of science or the kind of curriculum which 
would combine those aims, utilitarian considerations were 
very naturally deciding what kind of scientific curriculum 
would ultimately emerge. In 1839 a committee appointed 
to enquire into the best method of encouraging the fine 
arts had recommended the establishment of a Normal 
School of Design. Science had come in as an ally of the
-P-A-G-E-152
  138 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT [cH. 
arts and crafts; and the Science and Art Department, 
South Kensington, resulted. The great Industrial Exhibition 
drew attention to the defect of British handicrafts at the 
moment when science was “‘in the air,” and in 1859 Parlia- 
ment consented to the system of what became known as 
South Kensington grants. In 1851 there had been only 
thirty-eight science classes with 1300 pupils in the country; 
‘encouraged by these grants there were in 1861 seventy 
science schools with 2543 pupils. But the all-important 
problem of a supply of teachers was not effectively grappled 
with. The proposal to set up a strong central School of 
Science which would have produced a crop of efficient 
teachers was abandoned, and in its place was adopted the 
miserable substitute of an examination for science teachers. 
Before this examination was abandoned the pathway of 
scientific teaching was already clogged by a body of 
teachers who mistook cram for education and had no 
idea how to extract from their subject its inherent educa- 
tional value, who had acquired a knowledge of facts without 
being really trained, narrow specialists from whom no 
broad outlook could be expected. The Public Schools 
Commission of 1868 reported in favour of introducing two 
kinds of sciences into the seven schools, the first represented 
by physics and chemistry and the second by “‘ comparative 
physiology” and natural history; and the chairman of the 
Endowed Schools Commission afterwards stated! that it 
was the intention of that Commission to insist on one 
branch of science being taught in all schools and two in 
schools with a ‘‘modern”’ curriculum. The second demand 
sounds moderate beside the first, and it is evident that the 
Public School Commissioners had a very inadequate con- 
ception of the demands on time which branches of science 
make. Eventually the Royal Commission on Scientific 
Instruction, generally known as the Devonshire Com- 
mission, sat from 1871 to 1875, and presented a series of 
reports on the place of science in every grade of education. 
This Commission was intended to act as a general head- 
quarters for the scientific army to decide the plan of 
1 Sixth Report of Devonshire Commission, p. 3

v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 139 
operations, and as such it was urgently needed. The allied 
armies of mathematicians who were proud to discover a 
truth “ which could not possibly be of any use to anybody,” 
of chemists intent on preserving British industry against 
foreign competition, of biologists and geologists setting out 
with a missionary zeal to spread a new outlook on the 
universe, of naturalists intent on using Nature asa purifying 
agent on the pettinesses of economic man, and of physiolo- 
gists eager to improve sanitary conditions and the national 
physique, had each found that they had rushed certain 
positions and each believed that the next position on its 
own front was the key of the situation. Amongst them they 
had established honours examinations in Natural Science 
at the older universities, set up Colleges of a predominantly 
scientific character in London and other large towns, 
instituted classes for the diffusion of scientific knowledge 
among artisans, secured South Kensington grants for 
“Science and Art” classes, devised examinations for 
science teachers and made the public schools invite down 
a few perambulating scientific lecturers! Yet they had 
only taken the outworks. In 1870 the vast bulk of candi- 
dates for honours at the old universities were still studying 
the humanities or mathematics, the provincial colleges even 
where they existed had not yet attained university rank, 
the secondary schools scarcely taught science at all, there 
were few teachers of science and most of these had received 
a very narrow training, the smatterings of facts taught in 
a few elementary schools could not be called scientific 
teaching, and technical instruction was sadly deficient. 
The Commission investigated the teaching of science at 
every grade of education—elementary schools and train- 
ing colleges, South Kensington classes, the universities, 
museums, colleges and secondary schools, and published 
reports on each grade as soon as their work on it was 
complete. Their work showed the barrenness of the land 
beyond a doubt and inaugurated a rapid spread of scientific 
teaching in every branch of education. As regards the 
merit of its policy, it may be roughly said to have been 
best at the higher and worst at the lower stages.
-P-A-G-E-154

140 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT (cH. 
The elementary stage does not fall within our scope. 
Action at the next stage was taken rapidly, the reorganisa- 
tion of the South Kensington “Schools of Science” being 
largely carried out by Huxley in 1872. The result was a 
very doubtful success. Huxley, as we have seen, showed 
in his essays that he had a clear idea in what a good general 
education should consist, but his reorganised schools did 
not give it. Eighteen out of twenty-four hours were devoted 
to science and mathematics. In the remaining six hours 
what room was there for his moral and social training, his 
civic training through history and geography, his literature, 
music, and one or two languages? The problem was not 
approached from a broad point of view: instead of starting 
with the idea of a complete education in which science 
should have its due place, it was treated purely as a 
question of pushing the claims of science. Schools of 
Science were neither technical schools following a sound 
general education nor schools giving such an education. 
Without any such intention, but as a direct consequence 
of this partial view, the reformers practically brought it 
about that science was consoled for a subordination in 
the higher grades of secondary education by being given 
undisputed sway over a lower grade of quasi-secondary 
schools! with an earlier leaving age and an inferior status. 
Twenty years later the Bryce Commission unreservedly 
condemned the system on the ground that South Kensing- 
| ton schools suffered from a permanent examination fever. 
Nowhere was the insidious system of payment by results 
worked out so elaborately, and nowhere was education so 
completely replaced by “cramming.” One of the first 
acts of the Board of Education after its constitution in 
1899 was to assimilate these schools to the broader type 
of secondary schools which they encouraged. 
In the ordinary type of secondary school the Devonshire 
Commissioners found that science had very little place. In 
65 out of 128 endowed schools from which returns were   1 A “school” of science was not really a school at all, but usually 
a portion of a school, secondary or elementary, organised to receive

  v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT I4I 
received, no science at allwas taught. Of these only thirteen 
possessed laboratories!. It may be safely assumed that al- 
most every school in which it was taught would sendreturns. 
The Report recommends that science should be allotted 
six hours weekly on the time-table of all public and 
endowed schools and should be allowed one-sixth of the 
marks in all internal or leaving examinations. It may be 
noted that the Report assumes that the advice of the 
Public Schools Commissioners against a division of schools 
into sides would be taken, an assumption which a few 
years’ experience showed to be incorrect. More significant 
than anything which the Report contains is a vital point 
which it omits—the character of the scientific teaching to 
be given. No wonder. All the scientific specialists could 
agree in urging that “science” should be taught; but 
unanimity would have ceased the moment they tried to 
determine what science. On this point the most they tell 
us is that many authorities believe physics to be a better 
school subject than. chemistry’. 
The absence of all thought concerning curriculum and 
method from the minds of academic adherents of science 
makes it desirable to notice one of the few expositions of 
the scientific standpoint which came from the pens of 
practical schoolmasters—the essay by Wilson, science 
master at Rugby, in Farrar’s Essays on a Liberal Education 
(1867). Wilson is one of those who believed physics to be a 
better school subject than chemistry and he sees the need 
of thinking out a policy on the vital points which the 
Commissioners ignored. 
His main idea is that the study of two unlike branches 
of natural science is a necessary part of any complete 
education which is to give an all-round power of intelligent 
thought. In other words, the education of which science 
is a part, not science by itself, is to fulfil our third and 
fourth aims. His general view of the advantages of science 
does not substantially differ from that of Huxley. By 
appealing to native interests, science puts the pupil into 
the right active attitude of mind; it increases his grip, as 
1 Sixth Report, p. 1. ape, 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  142 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT [cH. 
is seen by his progress in other subjects, especially as 
regards activity of thought and sustained attention; it 
arouses and utilises curiosity; it is exact, it is “an applied 
logic.” He lays stress on accurate observation, exact 
reasoning, and power of judging evidence, “than which 
there is no characteristic so marked of the educated man.” 
Mathematics does not serve the same purpose. Science 
serves also as a preliminary to the research aim; for it is the 
business of the school to discover special aptitudes. He does 
not forget outlook; but he quotes from a report of the 
British Association to the effect that giving a literary 
acquaintance with scientific facts is not teaching science. 
Such an acquaintance can be easily given in addition; but 
it will be taken from sciences other than those which are 
formally studied—from astronomy, geology, and physical 
geography. Here we have the usual aims, but in addition 
a clear conception as to the means which elsewhere we 
have lacked. He claims no monopoly for science; we have 
to deal with Man as well as with Nature; and he regrets 
that so many advocates of science have ignored the claims 
of the aesthetic side of our being. 
He next discusses the choice of the two subjects for 
formal study. Since science proceeds from facts to laws, 
not from laws to facts, a certain broad array of facts must 
be known to the pupil before he can apply scientific 
methods; it is useless to supply foreign facts and forthwith 
expect him to deal with them scientifically. With what 
branches of science can he most easily deal scientifically? 
Geology and chemistry lend themselves too readily to 
cram. Botany and physics he does not think suffer from 
this defect, at least intrinsically, though ‘‘what they may 
become with bad text-books and bad teachers it is hard 
to say, but it is an important consideration.” The next 
twenty years indeed were to see the teaching of science 
ruined by neglect of this consideration! Wilson’s methods, 
unlike those of Armstrong later, made no attempt to 
delude the schoolboy into the belief that he was discovering 
everything for himself. But they distinctly aimed at 
1 Op. cit. p. 262.

v] THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 143 
making him think. “The teacher ought to make the pupils 
teach themselves, by thinking out the subject with them, 
by taking up their suggestions and illustrations, by criti- 
cising and hunting them down, by starting them on a fresh 
scent when they are at fault, by reminding them of some 
familiar fact which they had overlooked, and so eliciting 
out of the chaos of vague notions that are afloat something 
of order and concatenation and interest before the key 
to the mystery is given, even if after all it has to be given.” 
He starts in the middle of the school and proposes to 
extend science teaching a class lower each year till experi- 
ence determines the lowest point at which effective 
teaching can be given, and, when once that point has been 
determined, to carry on the science teaching therefrom 
up to the stage where the boys begin to specialise. 
Had some such policy as regards curriculum and method 
been officially adopted, the history of science teaching during 
the next twenty years might have been very different. 
During the seventies and eighties it gradually found its 
way into secondary schools. But, amid the welter of 
confused opinions as to aims, utilitarianism naturally 
triumphed. The subject which was commonly introduced 
was not physics, which would have formed the best intro- 
duction to scientific method, nor any of the open-air 
sciences which would have aroused a sense of the wonders 
to be found in Nature, but chemistry, the subject which 
appeared most likely to provide an immediate source of 
livelihood, and chemistry taught by rule of thumb. “‘ What 
science may become with bad text-books and bad teachers ” 
and bad examinations was now to be seen. The London 
Matriculation Examination had most influence on the 
schools which were most likely to take science; and in that 
examination it was possible to pass in chemistry without 
entering a laboratory—indeed it was the easiest way. The 
headmasters of the first-grade schools, whose prejudices 
needed to be overcome, were confirmed in their belief that 
science was an uneducative “cram” subject; and, faced 
with a utilitarian demand from certain parents for a subject 
in whose merits they did not believe, they solved the  
-P-A-G-E-158
    144 THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT [cH. 
difficulty by dividing their schools into two sides, a classical 
and a modern, and relegating science to the modern side. 
The more promising pupils were kept in the classical side 
to be prepared for university scholarships; and the modern 
side was welcomed as a means of disposing of stupid boys 
who would otherwise retard their progress. Then the 
failure of these stupid boys to get on in life was used as 
an argument for the inferiority of science as an intellectual 
discipline. 
We must hurry over the later stages and postpone the 
technical and university sides of science teaching to a 
later chapter!. In the nineties Armstrong, enthusiastic in 
his belief that chemistry was the finest of educational 
organa, but recognising that it was a tool blunted by bad 
modes of using it, started a crusade in favour of the 
“heuristic method,’”’ by which the pupil was supposed to 
discover everything for himself. Of course the pupil did 
nothing of the kind, as was discovered as soon as the London 
School Board allowed its pupils to be used as corpora vilia 
for this impossible experiment. But other causes were at 
work to improve the position of science. The technical 
schools which were established in the eighties brought out 
the fact that technical education can only be based on a 
sound general training in science, not on scientific cram. 
The provincial colleges developed into universities and 
began to produce an adequate supply of teachers in addi- 
tion to furnishing recruits to industry. Science steadily 
increased the number of its followers in the older uni- 
versities. Examinations were improved. A tradition of 
sound methods of teaching was established. In all the 
larger schools physics was introduced and was begun 
before chemistry. Botany, always popular in girls’ schools, 
began to be taught so as to produce scientific habits of 
mind. There are, however, still schools in which chemistry 
is the only branch of science taught, and these can hardly 
be said to give a scientific training. The Board of Education 
has reformed the curriculum of the old Schools of Science. 
Finally the war has created a rush to receive a scientific

training. Though in part this will probably prove to be 
a transient phenomenon, it will correct the balance which 
has hitherto inclined too strongly in favour of the 
humanities. 
There has been an attempt to represent the nearness 
with which the Germans came to victory as due to a sup- 
posed predominance of science in German education. In 
point of fact classics play a greater part in the school 
education of Germany than of England. The real error 
in English education is that it has been too specialised, 
leaving the man who has been trained in the humanities, 
and who naturally gravitates into the government of men, 
without even that bowing acquaintance with science which 
leads him to see where it is needed and when to call in the 
expert. German education is proponderatingly scientific 
onlyin the sense that in German universities the humanities 
have been studied in what we may call a scientific instead 
of a humanistic spirit; and this loss of the humanistic 
spirit is far from calling for imitation. The humanistic 
spirit is the soul of civilisation. The Greek world shows us 
that nations may be civilised with a very poor knowledge 
of natural science, though it is equally true that scientific 
enquiry will be one of the results which flow from civilisa- 
tion. But the inventions of modern science do not make 
a nation civilised—for two reasons; because science appeals 
only to the brain and not to the heart, and because it 
primarily demands the training of a small intellectual class. 
Russia is proving this fact. Russia had her small band of 
scientific experts; she had all the externals supplied by a 
century of scientific discovery; but below this was a pro- 
letariat unacquainted with literature, economics, and 
history, who were incapable of intelligent thought on 
morals, religion, politics, or social relations; and they have 
acted as men unacquainted with the rudiments of the 
humanities must act. Germany’s case has been different 
and the consequences have been different. Germany 
suffered from an intellectual caste who thought purely in 
terms of physical cause and effect and disdained that 
outcome of the humanistic way of studying the humanities

CHAPTER VI 
FIRST STATE INTERVENTION: 
THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 
OTHING perhaps accounts for the suggestion of 
dullness which the mention of Education conveys 
to the ordinary reader of the newspaper so much as the 
vision which it calls up of reports, blue books, and debates 
in Hansard. He instinctively feels that, if Education be 
a living thing, its true history must be found elsewhere: 
and he is right. The living force of education has always 
sprung from movements of the human mind and aspira- 
tions of the human heart; legislation and administration 
are mere tools which these movements and aspirations use. 
We may therefore view the Royal Commissions as marking 
the time when the educational zeal which had been de- 
veloping for half a century became conscious of its power 
and able to carry public opinion with it. 
The educational function of the State is now accepted 
by everyone except Mr Harold Cox. New State-controlled 
types of schools and colleges outnumber the old institutions. 
The old institutions themselves have been radically changed 
by the State. It is hard to put ourselves into the mental 
attitude either of Whigs or of Conservatives in 1850. The 
Whig attitude to education of those days was more con- 
servative than the attitude of Conservatives to-day. Yet 
the way of regarding the educational duty of the State 
which is well-nigh universal to-day would have been im- 
possible but for the triumph of the Whig views in the 
middle of last century. 
At that time Whigs, Conservatives, and even advanced 
Radicals restricted State activity within narrow limits. 
To the Whigs State action seemed to have had its day under 
the absolutist system of the Tudors, of Cromwell, and of 
the Stuarts: and in two directions especially had they been 
occupied in limiting its activity—control of trade and 
Io—2

control of conscience. Nor were extreme Radicals more 
friendly. Their ideals had grown up in France, the country 
where Louis XIV had truly said L’éat c’est mot, and demo- 
cratic prejudice against State action had not died out with 
the old régime. State control was associated, not with 
democracy, but with the “benevolent despots” of the 
eighteenth century, with the absolutist monarchies of 
Austria and Prussia. “Liberty” was the battle-cry both 
of Whigs and Radicals: State socialism had not arisen. 
As for the Conservatives, though they supported the 
retention of State control in departments of life where it 
already existed, yet they were equally opposed to its 
extension to new fields. 
No party, however, was prepared to apply its principles 
with unfailing consistency: facts were often too strong for 
theories. Thus, though the absolutist governments sought 
to control education because they suspected it, yet Prussia 
in the sphere of higher education used its control to develop 
it. The failure at Jena was too powerful a fact to be over- 
looked: Humboldt and Stein felt that the autocracy must 
make an ally of the middle classes and were wise enough to 
trust their new ally. Hence the efficient scheme of higher 
education which they produced! Democratic opinion too 
was driven in one direction by theories and in another by 
facts. Theoretically, to let the State control the schools 
seemed to the French Revolutionaries like handing soul 
as well as body to the rule of a master. Practically, how- 
ever, the wiser among them saw that an uneducated 
democracy would be unable to last and that without State 
control, State supply, and State compulsion the democracy 
would not become educated. A similar divergence of 
theoretical and practical views prevailed among English 
admirers of the Revolution and reappeared when by the 
establishment of the Committee of Council on Education 
in 1839 the State took the first serious step in the direction 
of educational control. Alongside of the two parties which 
on practical grounds supported the establishment of un- 
denominational State schools or the State support of 
denominational schools stood a third party—the ‘‘ Volun-

taryists ”—who on theoretical grounds rejected educational 
action by the Stateas outsideits sphere. But, whereas thelast 
party was small in numbers and, in the sphere of elementary 
education, facts were proving too stubborn for it to survive, 
yet in the sphere of secondary and university education 
everyone was a voluntaryist. The reason is obvious. 
Whereas the State was driven by an imperious necessity 
to intervene in regard to elementary education because 
without such intervention great masses of people would 
remain uneducated, some sort of a system existed already 
in regard to higher education and theory was not con- 
fronted with an irresistible obstacle of fact. 
In setting up the Royal Commissions there was therefore 
no intention of introducing permanent State control over 
higher education. On this matter the “common-sense” 
man did not differ substantially from the doctrinaires of 
the Manchester school. A “nation of shopkeepers” applied 
to education the principles of the market-place. No one 
valued what cost him nothing; competition was the best 
security and the parent the best judge of efficiency. If 
governors were to carry out their functions well, they must 
be interested either as buyers or as sellers of education, 
that is to say either as parents (or friends of parents) or 
through a feeling that they were competing with other 
institutions. The headmaster was the manager; as long as 
the business succeeded he must have a free hand with 
complete power over his subordinates. The application 
of these principles during the second half of the century 
produced a high degree of efficiency along certain lines, 
and those presumably such as parents desired. It involved, 
however, two great defects. First, it worked as it was 
intended only in regard to non-local institutions where 
competition was really free; it left unsolved the problem 
of local day-schools, since competition between several 
schools in a small town could only be wasteful. Secondly, 
it failed to see that the form of education which each 
parent would desire for his own child would normally be 
that which enabled him most successfully to compete with 
the children of other people and that this would not
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION (cH. 
necessarily be the form of education which the interests 
of the community rendered desirable for children as a 
whole. These problems will face us later: for the present 
it is enough to notice that the period of competition created 
two standards possibly higher than could otherwise have 
been obtained, the standard of attainment which could 
be expected of the picked pupil and the standard of dis- 
cipline on which an experienced teacher could insist. It 
did not create equally high standards in other directions 
as, for instance, the level of attainment which could be 
expected from the duller pupils or the level of teaching 
which could be expected to reach them. 
The ideal of the authors of the Royal Commissions was 
therefore individualistic and the best way to regard these 
Commissions is as temporary socialistic means for securing 
a permanent individualistic policy. The Whig individualists 
found in existence a number of institutions which had come 
down from days when schools and colleges were regarded 
neither as competing businesses nor as State agencies, but 
as quasi-ecclesiastical foundations. They were governed 
by archaic regulations of which the purpose had passed 
away; and their considerable endowments were in conse- 
quence being largely wasted. The Whigs took the common- 
sense view that, since by no possibility could these in- 
stitutions now carry out the exact intention of their 
founders, it was best to accept their modern aim, but to 
compel them to fulfil it more adequately by adopting the 
competitive principle, and to scrap all founders’ conditions 
which ran contrary to that principle. Harrow School, for 
instance, was intended by its founder to teach elementary 
classics to any boy in the parish whose parents wished for 
such an education; but its present income was many times 
more than would suffice if every Harrow parent had desired 
his son to learn classics. In point of fact it had for a 
hundred and fifty years been an aristocratic school and 
most of its present income represented capitalised profits 
from the fees of its aristocratic pupils. Hence the Whig 
policy, after providing an education—classical or otherwise 
as they desired—for the inhabitants of Harrow, was to
-P-A-G-E-165
     
vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS I51 
spend the rest of the income on the aristocratic school, to 
conduct that school on competitive business lines, and to 
sweep away all existing regulations which prevented this 
being done. Nowadays this policy would have to face a 
powerful rival; it would be proposed to apply the endow- 
ments neither to the founders’ nor to existing purposes, 
but to those which seemed best to the State as represented 
by the majority in Parliament. But this view commanded 
little effective support in the middle of last century; and 
the only opposition to the Whig view came from that body 
of Conservative opinion which was alarmed by every sup- 
posed assault on vested interests or on tradition. 
The policy of the Royal Commissions may not have 
been the best possible; but, when the coach is stuck fast 
in the mud, it is something to have got it out and set it 
moving. Subsequently to change its course is a much 
easier process than originally to make it move at all. It is 
hard nowadays to realise how deeply embedded universities, 
colleges, and schools were in the mass of founders’ regula- 
tions, mediaeval and Reformation statutes, and other 
unalterable decrees. Pious founders had no conception of 
future changes; even at the time of the Renaissance, when 
they were deliberately improving on ‘“‘the barbarous 
grossness of the Middle Ages,” they never envisaged the 
possibility of a time when their own arrangements would 
appear equally out of date. The more pious the founder, 
the more carefully did he prescribe for his foundation the 
details of its administration. He fixed salaries regardless 
of future changes in the value of money; and by the 
nineteenth century they were generally inadequate to 
secure the services of any man fitted to be a headmaster. 
He generally prohibited the taking of fees, or fixed them 
so low that there was no means of legitimately increasing ~ 
these inadequate salaries. He imposed curricula which 
were subsequently enforced by the law-courts in so literal 
a manner that, in the Leeds case, a classical school was 
prohibited from giving a “modern” education even when 
there was no demand for classics. He often imposed oaths 
to do things which were no longer possible, to the scandal
-P-A-G-E-166
  
152 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION [cH. 
of onlookers who regarded oaths seriously and to the con- 
fusion of recipients who found it hard to distinguish those 
which had become mere forms from others with which 
compliance might still be expected. Naturally there was 
much straining at gnats and much swallowing of camels. 
The same general principles of sweeping away obsolete 
statutes, providing new constitutions, and then leaving 
administration—and legislation, subject to the consent of 
the Queen in Council—to the institutions themselves, were 
applied to the universities, to the public schools, and to the 
smaller endowed schools, by the Acts which followed the 
various commissionst. Each class of institution will now 
be considered separately. 
(1) The Universities. The Oxford Commission was a 
result of the wave of academic liberalism which swept over 
the University after 1845. As Mark Pattison? claimed, 
“All her recent reforms have been the work of a minority, 
it is true, but still a minority of her own family. The 
movement commenced from within. Is it too bold to say 
that more enlightened views as to her proper destiny and 
worth are entertained by those whom she has trained than 
are to be found elsewhere in that public opinion by which 
she is most seriously arraigned.’’ At Cambridge too the 
movement for a commission originated with a progressive 
minority. The majority of the old academic governing 
bodies was, however, opposed to change, and the reformers 
appealed to the Prime Minister, Lord John Russell. Feeling 
ran high, as any reader may see who cares to peruse a skit 
called The University Commission or Lord John Russell’s 
Postbag of April 27, 1850, by William Sewell, fellow of 
Exeter and founder of Radley. Its general style is often 
to be found to-day in undergraduate journals, but these 
would usually refrain from describing the Cabinet as thieves 
and from attacking the Royal Family as Sewell attacks

Commission (1849-1853), the latter of which led to the passing of

terested in educational law.

the Prince Consort. Commissions were appointed for both 
universities (1850), and, on their report, Acts of Parliament 
were passed to carry out parts of their recommendations 
(Oxford, 1854, Cambridge 1856). Another period of con- 
troversy followed, both sides producing a shower of pam- 
phlets, amongst which those by Mark Pattison and Goldwin 
Smith state the reformers’ position most clearly, till a 
fresh commission was appointed to enquire into the pro- 
perty and income of the universities and their colleges, 
and, on its report of 1873, a fresh Universities Act was 
passed in 1877. It will be convenient to treat the reforms 
of the whole forty years under a few main headings. 
(a) Constitution. The need of change is shown by the fact 
that Cambridge was still governed by the enactments of 
Queen Elizabeth and Oxford by those of Archbishop Laud. 
These archaic constitutions they could not change in any 
important feature even if they wished. Real power was 
vested in the heads of colleges, who alone could initiate 
legislation; a final veto, but without the power of amend- 
ment, was given to the whole body of masters who had 
“kept their names on the books,” 7.e. continued to pay 
a yearly fee. Heads of colleges were usually elderly men 
who, in an age of rapid change, had probably fallen behind 
the times; and the bulk of masters of arts who kept their 
names on the books were country clergy, for the most part 
ultra-conservative. The college tutors as such had no voice 
in the government of the university. The Acts of 1854 and 
1855 swept away the old enactments, substituted a change- 
able for a rigid constitution, reduced the heads of colleges 
to one-third of the initiating committee, added a new 
body composed of resident masters of arts (who would be 
mainly college tutors) who could amend as well as reject 
the proposals of this committee, but left the final right of 
veto to the whole body of masters resident and non-resident. 
On the whole the new constitution has worked well. The 
tutors have proved to be alive to the need of progress and 
have in the last fifty years transformed the universities 
almost out of recognition; and the non-residents have in 
most cases been deterred by the trouble of a journey to  
-P-A-G-E-168
  154 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION [cH. 
‘Oxford or Cambridge from opposing their reforms. But on 
certain issues, notably the admission of women to degrees, 
the abolition of compulsory Greek, and the admission of 
Nonconformists to theological degrees and examinerships, 
the wishes of residents were time after time over-ridden 
by the veto of the non-residents. Since the war Oxford 
has, however, adopted all three changes, though Cambridge 
still refuses degrees to women. The Act of 1877, through 
the schemes made by a body of commissioners appointed 
under it, has similarly swept away the old college statutes 
and given the colleges new constitutions. 
(b) Fellowships and Scholarships. The revenues of the 
universities and their colleges taken together were very 
substantial; but by far the greater part belonged to the 
colleges. On the fellows of colleges fell the bulk of the 
teaching in the university; and college scholarships con- 
stituted almost the sole provision for helping needy 
students. But both fellowships and scholarships were so 
tied up by founders’ restrictions that they could not be 
used to the best advantage. Life fellowships without duties, 
the well-nigh universal requirement of celibacy, the general 
insistence on holy orders, restriction of fellowships to 
persons born in particular counties or educated at par- 
ticular schools, automatic progress from scholarships to 
fellowships, were all subjects of attack. The earlier com- 
mission gave the death-blow to geographical restrictions, 
and the later completed the work of reform on all points. 
Life fellowships are now confined to those who have long 
held tutorial or administrative posts in their colleges, the 
requirement of orders has been removed, and the present 
generation is perfectly familiar with the married fellow 
who resides outside the walls of his college. The Oriel 
plan of electing fellows by competitive examination has 
not, however, been generally followed. When once the 
tradition of favouritism had been broken down, the main 
reason for such a method of selection ceased; and, in 
choosing a man who will become a college tutor, colleges 
prefer selecting the person whose record shows him most 
fitted for the post, just as electors to any other office
-P-A-G-E-169
  
vr] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 135 
would. Scholarships were almost universally thrown open 
to free competition. 
It is still not unusual to hear regret expressed for the 
loss of certain features in the old system; but there can be 
little doubt that a big balance of advantage has accrued 
from the changes. 
The alteration in the tenure of fellowships has abolished 
the drone, who was rewarded for early scholastic successes 
by being freed from the necessity of using his abilities for 
the benefit of the community; nor has the institution of 
married fellows resulted, as was feared, in their losing 
interest in college life or influence over the undergraduates. 
Great as was the importance attached to this influence by 
supporters of the old order, it cannot be inferred from 
independent sources that it was ever so strong as at the 
present day, and in many colleges it was almost negligible. 
Indeed modern times have created a number of tutors whose 
relations to the undergraduates, like those of the modern 
assistant master to his boys, would have been inconceivable 
to the stiff old days. Leslie Stephen, as fellow of Trinity 
Hall, Cambridge (1854-1864), was probably the first tutor 
who coached his college boat, appeared in ‘“‘shorts,”’ and 
shared every intellectual and social activity of his men. 
As regards scholarships, it is sometimes suggested that 
the old system did more to provide for the needs of poor 
students. It is true that in the middle of the last century, 
a period of almost unreasoning belief in competitive ex- 
aminations, many people expected them to secure an 
equality of opportunity which it is not in their nature to 
produce. Success in a competitive examination was bound 
to depend in a large measure on previous educational 
advantages, which in those days were not open to all 
classes. But the obvious remedy was to open up the 
avenue of secondary education, not to choose scholars on 
grounds other than their proved abilities. Now and again 
no doubt a poor boy who happened to be born, say, in the 
Channel Islands may have won a close scholarship which, 
had it been open, might have gone to a wealthier com- 
petitor; but there is nothing in the nature of the case which 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
156 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION [cH. 
would tend to produce such a result. One advantage at 
least has accrued from the change, that no eleemosynary 
suspicion attaches to scholarships; they are regarded as 
rewards of merit, and, with a nation like the English 
which loves a contest, the respect felt for victory in a 
competition has come to attach a value to industry. It 
was a sound instinct which prompted the reformers to 
consider it their first task to stimulate a working spirit in 
the universities; only after that had been accomplished 
would admission to them become a real advantage to the 
poorer student. 
(c) Religious tests. Up to the time of the first com- 
missions admission had been refused to Nonconformists 
at Oxford, and at Cambridge they could study but not 
graduate. The earlier Acts secured them admission and 
initial degrees; and a special act passed by Gladstone’s 
government in 1871 swept away tests altogether save for 
degrees in divinity. Even this restriction has been recently 
removed. 
(d) Diminution of expense. A much debated question 
in contemporary pamphlets was the increase in accommo- 
dation and particularly provision for a poorer class of 
student. The importance attached to this question is a 
sign that the universities were beginning to prove attractive 
on real educational grounds. The mere provision of ad- 
ditional room was easily secured at Oxford by allowing 
members of a college to live for part of their time outside 
the college walls, as they already did at Cambridge, and 
at both universities by extensive additions to college 
buildings. The steps taken to provide a less expensive mode 
of life, however, did not fulfil the expectations of their 
authors. The permission of “private halls” by the earlier 
Acts was a vain attempt to restore an institution which 
had passed away in Tudor times; and the institution of 
non-collegiate students in 1868 has been a doubtful success. 
Sumptuary legislation is always difficult. Neither rules 
nor college tutors were responsible for the cost of living in 
Oxford and Cambridge; hence neither changes in rules 
nor the efforts of tutors could do much to diminish it.
-P-A-G-E-171
    
vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 157 
Even so stout a reformer as Goldwin Smith gave up the 
problem as insoluble. The right atmosphere in a university 
is only possible where there is no feeling of social inequality, , 
and in this respect there was a great change for the 
better in the second half of the century. Social equality, 
however, tends to produce at each end of the scale an 
approximation to equality of expenditure. While extra- 
vagance has decreased among the wealthier, the poorer, 
finding that a smaller increase in expenditure is needed to 
keep them in the full swing of college life, spend more than 
they would if they were able to set the prevailing scale 
for themselves. However, the opening up of the univer- 
sities has been facilitated in a number of ways. The boy 
of real ability, whatever his means, is better able to get 
a good secondary education; and scholarships are won 
from an extended range of schools. Sport has helped to 
end the supremacy of the wealthy “set.” The river, as 
a dominating factor in college life, is said to date from 1843; 
“before that year the college races were a mere pleasing 
incident in a summer term?” ; and cricket, played in black 
coats and beaver hats, soon followed. Football, the least 
expensive and most democratic of all games, came in over 
thirty years later. Partnership in such sports tends to 
bind all members of a college together; whereas the old 
expensive recreations of hunting, shooting, and riding 
inevitably kept the wealthier men apart: and, in an 
athletic society, the best athlete, not the man who can 
afford to entertain most, will take the lead. It is true to 
say that nowadays brains, athletic prowess, the gift of 
public speaking, or any other clear capacity, counts for 
more than wealth. 
(ce) New professorships. Perhaps the most hotly debated 
point in the war of pamphlets was the real or supposed 
antagonism between the “professorial” and “‘tutorial’’ 
systems. In all countries save England, not even excluding 
Scotland, university instruction has been given by pro- 
fessors, that is to say, experts specifically responsible for 
lecturing on some one subject or branch of a subject. In 
1 W. Tuckwell, Reminiscences of Oxford, p. 113. B 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  158 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION (cu. 
Oxford and Cambridge alone the university had been sub- 
ordinated to its colleges, which had been originally designed 
purely as places of residence, and university lectures had 
become only a small excrescence on a system of college 
tuition. Long ago a different system had prevailed. Un- 
able to provide paid instructors, the mediaeval university 
had compelled every master of arts to undertake lecturing 
for a certain period as a condition of receiving his degree. 
Henry VIII, to encourage humanism, had endowed a few 
professorial chairs at each university, and other professor- 
ships, mostly miserably paid, had come into existence. 
Most of these represented subjects which lay outside the 
somewhat narrow scope of the existing degree courses; 
hence the bulk of the teaching was in the hands of the 
college tutors. The theory that the decadence of the uni- 
versity had been due almost entirely to this cause was 
first propounded by Sir William Hamilton in 1831. Both 
his Scottish birth and his German training helped to make 
him favourable to professorial instruction; and he was able 
to prove by researches in existing statutes that it was still 
legally obligatory in Oxford, and that all degrees given 
for the last century and a half were probably void! The 
existing system certainly involved a needless reduplication 
of lectures, and, by requiring college tutors to teach every 
branch of a subject, prevented them from becoming expert 
in anything. In fact Hamilton summed it up by saying 
that it replaced one great university by twenty small ones! 
The two purposes for which specialist lecturers were most 
needed were to give the highest instruction to candidates 
for honours in the older subjects and to provide altogether 
for the teaching of the new subjects. Candidates for these 
new subjects were still too few for each college to provide 
a tutor in them; and the introduction of further honours 
schools would increase the difficulty. The reformers also 
recognised the width of the older subjects and foresaw 
that many of the best candidates would be attracted 
towards different aspects of them. They did not wish to 
mould everyone in one pattern. Though the linguistic, 
literary, historical, and philosophical sides of classical
-P-A-G-E-173
  vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 159 
antiquity covered a wonderfully wide range of interests, 
there might be among the more original minds some to 
whom classical art, archaeology, comparative philology, 
or some yet unexplored aspect of classics, might appeal 
more. Moreover, the tutorial system had been devised for 
the ordinary pass-man; and, at the very time when the 
majority of tutors were uniting to urge that only by its 
means could real teaching be secured, practically every 
candidate for high honours was paying for private 
“coaching”’ because he could not get what he wanted from 
ais college tutors. 
But the defence of the tutorial system, which even Mark 
Pattison wished to see surviving along with the other, was 
by no means entirely the outcome of stolid conservatism. 
Its defenders understood the meaning of education better 
than some of its opponents. They knew that the majority 
of undergraduates needed not mere lecturing but real 
teaching, not very different from what they had received 
in the higher forms at school. Question and answer were 
required to make them think, exercises were required to 
develop skill and mastery of their subject, regular pre- 
paration for classes was required to secure steady work. 
For the brilliant student lectures by specialist enthusiasts 
would do all that was needed; they would inspire, would 
suggest new lines of thought, and would point out where 
he could find information for himself. But on the man 
who was not susceptible to inspiration and did not wish 
to seek information for himself, they were wasted. Modern 
experience confirms the belief that instruction which con- 
fines itself to lecturing leads to mere receptivity, uncritical 
acceptance of others’ ideas, and ‘‘cram.” But, on the 
other hand, a university in which the teachers do nothing 
but drill pass students is little more than an adult school. 
It will hardly furnish the atmosphere in which new 
scientific discoveries, new interpretations of history, new 
ideas on social and political questions, or a fuller apprecia- 
tion of art and literature are likely to develop. 
Both parties had their extreme wings. To the one extreme 
it appeared that knowledge and wisdom had quitted
-P-A-G-E-174
  160 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION [cH. 
Olympus to dwell only with the Greeks, and that, after 
their rescue from a long captivity by the knight-errants 
of the Renaissance, they had consented to dwell with the 
moderns only on condition that they would speak no other 
language than Greek or Latin. At the other pole were men 
who appeared to think nothing to be true but what is new, 
nothing admirable but what is paradoxical, nothing native 
so good as what is foreign. Solid insular narrowness was 
set against unsteady eclectic brilliance. To the one side 
subjects existed to train men, to the other men existed 
to develop subjects. Training of character was set in 
opposition to the enlargement of knowledge. The older 
school claimed to give men of action to the nation, the 
newer to give inspiring ideas to the world. 
The result, as finally reached by 1881, was a compromise. 
The professoriate has a considerable voice in determining 
policy through the faculties, it organises and conducts 
research, and takes a large part in teaching subjects for 
which there is not a sufficient demand for the colleges to 
provide. In natural science, where the laboratory is the 
centre of work, its influence is more felt than in the 
humanities. New chairs have been established and old 
chairs adequately endowed. College fellowships have been 
attached to university professorships. But now that college 
lectures have been practically opened to the whole univer- 
sity—a change which has grown up gradually since 1870— 
college tutors in fact fulfil the duties of additional university 
professors; and the conduct of a college lecture on the lines 
of sixth form work in a school is now a rarity. 
(f) Higher degrees. The new examinations had only 
affected the qualification for the initial degree of B.A. 
Mere seniority and payment of fees qualified the bachelor 
to become a master and the master a doctor of law or 
divinity. A half-hearted attempt was made to impose 
conditions for the mastership of arts but was soon dropped. 
In more recent times research degrees of B.Litt. and B.Sc. 
have been set up to take the place which the M.A. and 
M.Sc. occupy in modern universities, and degrees of D.Litt. 
and D.Sc. to recognise original work of a high order. The
-P-A-G-E-175
  vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS I6r 
doctorate of divinity has likewise in recent times been 
made a reality. 
(g) Research. The desire to encourage research had 
much to do both with the demand for a professorial system 
and with the desire to make the higher degrees a genuine 
mark of distinction. Research is a modern idea. In the 
Middle Ages a university had two functions, to establish 
truth by argument and to hand it down by lectures. The 
establishment of truth was believed to depend on syllo- 
gistic reasoning from indisputable premises; observation 
and experiment in the sciences, the investigation of records 
in the humanities, were unknown. The Renaissance al- 
most wholly extinguished the work of the universities in 
finding out truth. The idea that all knowledge worth 
having had been possessed by the ancients confined dis- 
covery within the narrow limits of finding and studying 
classical manuscripts. The authors were then treated as 
authoritative, and for several centuries the functions of a 
university were almost limited to handing down what 
was already known. Scientific discoveries might be made 
more copiously than ever before; but the universities had 
little share in the work. Even the scholarship of Bentley 
and Porson, and the discoveries of the great mathe- 
maticians, were regarded as something exceptional, not 
as illustrations of what might generally be expected of 
university teachers. The abandonment of all attempt to 
add to the sum of knowledge has a deadening effect on the 
teaching of existing knowledge. Research revived in 
Germany, in the middle of the eighteenth century. By the 
middle of the nineteenth century the idea had made such 
progress in that country that an addition to knowledge 
was expected not only from every professor but from every 
candidate for a degree. Power of research became almost 
the sole test of academic merit and the sole passport to 
academic promotion. The transmission of existing culture 
and the training of men of action were altogether sub- 
ordinated to the research aim. These two views of the 
function of a university were now to cross swords in this 
country.

Mark Pattison may be taken as representative of the 
adherents of research. He wished to set up a professoriate 
of the German type and to give up some of the colleges 
wholly to researchers. As teaching institutions, he held, 
the German universities were no better than our own; 
but as centres of research they were unique. The falsity 
of some of the German hypotheses had been urged in con- 
demnation of the system; but Pattison contends that 
“a fertility of ingenious hypotheses is a well-known 
condition of any period of scientific activity,”’ and he urges 
the stimulating effect of Wolf’s influence on philology, 
Niebuhr’s on history, and Baur’s on theology, irrespective 
of the truth or falsity of their particular conclusions. 
“The highest education cannot be given through a litera- 
ture or a science which has no higher than an educational 
value.’ “The university is largely distinguished from the 
school, that the pupil here takes leave of disciplinal studies 
and enters on real knowledge. The student comes to the 
university to grapple with those thoughts which are 
occupying the men of the time.” The teacher who is also 
a student can inspire us as the mere teacher cannot. But, 
though “the university is an association of men of science, 
it is not for the sake of science that they are associated. 
A professoriate has for its duty to maintain, cultivate, and 
diffuse extant knowledge.” 
A generation was to elapse before these arguments were 
to bear fruit. The professoriate of the Scottish universities 
and of University College, London, were far ahead of the 
older universities in research in the domain of natural 
science. The last thirty years have seen a great change in 
Oxford and Cambridge as regards both scientific and 
historical investigation. The university now sets out to 
train researchers and to guide research in both spheres. 
So assured is the position of the older universities that 
another thirty years will probably see them pre-eminent 
in this as in other spheres. The newer universities certainly 
secured a start upon them; but it is very probable that 
they attempted to imitate Germany too closely by as- 
suming that research is within the reach of every young

graduate who has taken an honours degree. Arts and 
science here differ widely; and the distinction has been 
too often forgotten. Industrial processes give an inex- 
haustible field for scientific discoveries, great or small; but 
the third-rate historian, the mediocre critic, and the semi- 
scientific economic researcher are rather a danger than an 
aid to the cause of truth. There is no inherent virtue in 
contact with original authorities which trains a man to 
estimate a policy, to judge of character, to acquire a sense 
of values, or even to know when a thing is proved and when 
it is not. The older universities may have hit the happy 
mean in confining research in the humanities to their first- 
rate men. 
The lapse of another fifty years since 1870 has seen 
another commission appointed to investigate the work of 
the older universities, the result of which belongs to the 
future. 
(2) The Public Schools. The Commission reported 
in 1864, and such of its recommendations as required 
legislation were embodied in the Public Schools Act of 
1868. These, however, concerned only the administrative 
side, and followed the lines which have been indicated at 
the beginning of the chapter. Adopting the principles of 
the University Commission, the Commissioners formulate 
them in the words of the Edinburgh Review: “The statutes 
of founders are to be upheld and enforced whenever they 
conduce to the general objects of the foundation, but they 
are to be modified whenever they require a closer adapta- 
tion to the wants of modern society.” Reformed governing 
bodies were set up, and on them was imposed the duty of 
so revising the statutes as to remove local restrictions on 
masterships and scholarships and to reorganise the ex- 
penditure on prizes and scholarships. The revised statutes 
ere to be approved by the Queen in Council. It may be 
oted that, while the Commission dealt with the two large 
lay schools, St Paul’s and Merchant Taylors’, these two 
chools were omitted from the Act and left to be included 
n the subsequent Endowed Schools Act. 
More interesting is the part of the report which dealt

with the internal affairs of the schools. For purposes of 
comparison, information was secured from the newer 
foundations of Cheltenham, Marlborough, and Wellington; 
but the Commission was in no sense an enquiry into these 
schools. However guarded was the language in which the 
commissioners couched their conclusions, it is clear that 
their general verdict, while not too condemnatory (because 
they recognised that there had been a considerable im- 
provement in recent years), emphasised the need of far 
more amendment before the schools could be regarded as 
doing their duty. Rugby and Shrewsbury seem to escape 
the general condemnation. Idleness is the chief count in 
the indictment. There is little suggestion of sins of com- 
mission on the part of the public schoolboy; but his sins 
of omission are so great that we are left at the end with 
a picture of a good-natured, easy-going youth, without 
intellectual interests or any conception of a purpose in 
life, who is almost certain to succumb, the moment he 
leaves school, to the temptations of self-indulgence, 
frivolity and carelessness. As they pass from the con- 
sideration of curriculum to this section of their report, they 
observe: “‘ We have found no difficulty in ascertaining what 
is taught at these schools; to discover what and how much 
is learned in them is difficult and is only roughly practic- 
able.”” Then they trace how one-third of the candidates 
fail in the Christ Church matriculation, how it would be 
useless to try the bulk of the candidates with an unseen, 
and how only one piece of Latin Prose in four is free from 
bad blunders; and thus they work up to their conclusion 
that, though the best scholars usually come from the 
public schools, they “send also (and in this Eton has a 
certain pre-eminence) the idlest and most ignorant men.” 
Holding, as they do, that the classical languages are the 
best of all educational instruments, their condemnation 
of the narrowness of the course is all the more remarkable. 
“A young man is not® well educated—and indeed is not 
educated at all—who cannot reason or observe or express 
himself easily and correctly....He is not well educated if 
all his information is shut up within one narrow circle.”
-P-A-G-E-179
  vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 165 
There can be little doubt that, as regards curriculum, 
they took the German Gymnasien as their model. They 
pronounce against the attempt to divide the school into 
a classical and a “modern” side, possibly foreseeing what 
happened within a few years, when, in spite of their advice, 
the system spread from Cheltenham, Marlborough, and 
Wellington to the older schools. Nor do they appear to 
contemplate the possibility of a first-grade ‘“‘modern” 
school; the Ober-realschule, with a leaving age of nineteen 
and admitting to certain faculties in the university, was 
still to come. Specialisation at the top of the school is to 
be limited to such minor variations as substituting ad- 
ditional non-classical work for Latin and Greek verse. Here 
again the progress of events in England has been in a 
diametrically opposite direction, though German schools 
still keep the pupil engaged in all his subjects of study to 
the sixth form inclusive. For the commissioners, classics 
is still, as in the Gymnasien, to be the chief study, but 
not, as heretofore, the only subject taken seriously. “The 
writing of brilliant Latin verses is not, however, the 
ultimate end of school education.” ‘The one main object 
for which boys learn the dead languages is to teach them 
to use their own.”’ They are even a little distrustful of the 
Arnoldian tendency to emphasise subject-matter: ‘‘the 
mind of a boy must indeed of necessity be principally 
directed to the style and language of his books, since it is 
chiefly with a view to language that he is employed upon 
them.’’ They sound the death-knell of the old original 
theme: in this respect current practice follows them to 
greater lengths than they were perhaps prepared to go, 
for it has been entirely replaced by translation of English 
into Greek or Latin. Indeed it has been left to the direct 
method to revive free composition even in the case of 
modern languages. Mathematics—again as in the Gym- 
nasien—holds second place, and such absurdities as the 
treatment of mathematical masters as a subordinate caste 
receive their cowp de graéce. The remarks on modern lan- 
guages seem to belong to a different era from our own—so 
great is the improvement which the direct method, not
-P-A-G-E-180
166 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION (cu. 
then dreamed of, has effected. It is strange reading that 
the teaching of modern languages was, in spite of current 
opinion, as bad abroad as in Englend! Arnold’s plan of 
making form masters teach French is declared to be passing 
away, but the report laments the deficiency of Englishmen 
competent to become specialist teachers of the subject. 
The section on history does not suggest the ‘barbarous 
grossness” of the Middle Ages quite so much as that on 
French; but it is only the first streak of dawn which is 
visible. Indeed one headmaster, questioned on the subject, 
frankly told the Commission:—‘‘I wish we could teach 
more history, but as to teaching it in set lessons, I should 
not know how to do it.” Their conclusion may be de- 
scribed as feeling after the truth “if haply they might 
find it.” It runs thus: ‘‘To gain an elementary knowledge 
of history, little more is required than some sustained but 
not very laborious efforts of memory; it may therefore be 
acquired easily and without any mental exercise of much 
value—which, however, is not a sufficient reason for not 
acquiring it....But a good teacher who is likewise a good 
historian will always, we believe, be able to make the 
acquisition of even the elements of historical knowledge 
something more than a mere exertion of memory—to make 
it, with the more advanced boys, a real introduction to 
the method of historical study, and a vehicle for imparting 
some true insight into history and interest init.’’ Apparently 
the device most in favour with progressive teachers was 
to experiment with Guizot and other French or German 
writers, with the object of seeing if they could produce 
a modern equivalent for Arnold’s lessons on Thucydides 
and Tacitus. It is interesting to note that Rugby, Marl- 
borough and Wellington were the scenes of this experiment 
—another trace of Arnold’s direct influence. Geography 
is not recognised like history as something which may grow 
out of being a mere memory subject. It is, as in Germany, 
a kind of handmaid to history. But in nothing is the 
influence of the Gymmnasien so noticeable as in the section 
on natural science. The influence of those who were in a 
few years to make it a bedrock subject shows no trace 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 167 
in the report. Class-teaching for one or two hours a week 
is contemplated, just as in the case of German Naturkunde. 
So little did the Commissioners appreciate the subject with 
which they were dealing that they evidently believed that 
in this time two kinds of science—the physico-chemical 
and the biological—could be profitably handled! Such is 
the danger of substituting attempts to imitate for first 
hand acquaintance with the matter with which you are 
dealing. How much of the handling of education by 
“educationalists””—as distinguished from educators—has 
in England during the last fifty years been of this kind! 
Finally the “‘many-sided” aim which the Gymnasien had 
not very successfully attempted to transform from Her- 
bartian theory into class-room practice is completed by 
the demand that either music or drawing should be intro- 
duced to meet aesthetic requirements. 
(3) Schools Inquiry Commission. The Report of this 
Commission in 1868, which was followed by the passing of 
the Endowed Schools Act in 1869, marks the middle of 
our period in point of time, and may in addition be re- 
garded as a turning point in the direction of our interests 
which will henceforth be directed to the great mass of 
secondary schools which had hitherto been quite unable 
to assert themselves. The newer type of university had 
not come into being, and the majority of the schools had 
little connection with Oxford and Cambridge. The Com- 
mission found that 550 so-called grammar schools sent no 
boys to the universities and of the eighty or ninety schools 
which did, only forty sent three every year. The “‘seven” 
accounted for 529 undergraduates, St Paul’s and Merchant 
Taylors’ for 48 and seven of the newly founded schools for 
235, and two of the old grammar schools which had forced 
their way recently into public school rank—Repton and 
Uppingham—were responsible for 71. This would account 
for almost half the total number of undergraduates in 
residence and a far higher proportion of scholarship- 
holders. Moreover the Commission discovered that few 
endowed schools prepared boys for the examinations of 
London University or even sent them in for the newly-
-P-A-G-E-182
  168 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION {cH. 
instituted Local Examinations. Nor did these schools make 
up for their weakness on the more strictly academic side 
by superiority in the new fields of intellectual activity. The 
newer foundations like Cheltenham were the pioneers in 
this direction. 
It is not implied that the progress of the last fifty years 
is entirely, or even mainly, due to the Endowed Schools 
Commission. Walker was already showing at Manchester 
what could be done with a large city day school. Day 
schools of new foundation were already proving themselves 
efficient: King’s College School had been founded in 1829, 
University College School in 1832, Liverpool College in 
1840. Proprietary schools, founded by the inhabitants of 
various towns for the benefit of the town rather than for 
profit, were already fairly numerous. Cheltenham (1841), 
Marlborough (1842), Rossall (1844), Epsom (1855), Wel- 
lington (1859), Clifton (1860), Malvern (1862), Radley 
(1863), and Haileybury (1864) were trying to imitate the 
good features of the old boarding schools and to avoid 
their defects. Woodard had founded his three Church 
schools—Lancing, Hurstpierpoint, and Ardingly—to meet 
three different levels of income. Thring was at work at 
Uppingham; and Sherborne, Repton, and Tonbridge had 
emerged into prominence from being local grammar schools. 
On the whole these schools catered for the more pros- 
perous part of the middle class, with whom there was a 
genuine interest in the education of their sons. Not ex- 
clusively; Manchester, Birmingham, and Bradford at any 
rate were already means of enabling the children of the 
lower middle class as well to reach the university; Woodard 
aimed at seeing how far the boarding school system could 
be made suitable to the needs of a poorer class than that 
which would supply his first grade school at Lancing; and 
the Commission notices the recent attempt to found 
“County Schools,” z.e. boarding schools of a fairly cheap 
character to meet the needs of rural districts, of which the 
Surrey County School at Cranleigh (founded by sub- 
scription in 1865, with 153 boys) and the Suffolk school at 
Framlingham (310 boys) were examples. ‘‘As far as they
-P-A-G-E-183
  vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 169 
have been tried,’’ the Commissioners remark, “there have 
not, perhaps, been anywhere more successful or more 
promising undertakings than those great modern schools.” 
But the success of a few large day schools and of private 
efforts in the case of a few middle class boarding schools 
only brought into bolder relief the needs of the bulk of 
towns and counties alike, where it made clear that pro- 
vision, were it only made, would be eagerly accepted. 
The Commissioners interpreted their reference in no 
narrow spirit. They regarded enquiry into the existing 
supply of schools as merely a preliminary task. Their first 
duty was to suggest how existing endowments could be 
utilised to extend that supply. They found that very much 
could be done simply by the best use of such funds as were 
already available; and this part of their recommendations 
was carried into effect by the Endowed Schools Act which 
followed their report. But they did not regard this as the 
end of their work: the creation of a complete system of 
secondary education could not, in their opinion, be effected 
out of existing endowments; to establish a system at all 
comparable to that of Prussia, State aid was necessary, 
and their report boldly aims at securing some measure of 
State control and some measure of public supply such as 
was secured in the domain of elementary education in the 
following year (1870). In this hope they proved to be in 
advance of public opinion; their wishes were only partially 
included in the Bill, and even those proposals had to be 
dropped to facilitate its passage through Parliament, on 
the understanding that they would be brought forward 
again in a subsequent session—an intention which was 
not carried out till after a second commission had reported 
in 1895. The country had thus to wait over thirty years 
for the Act of 1902. 
In one respect the Commissioners almost exceeded their 
instructions, or at any rate acted upon them in a way 
which was hardly in the minds of those who drew up the 
reference. They took the bold step of construing that 
reference as covering the secondary education of girls as 
well as boys, thereby opening a new era in girls’ education.  
-P-A-G-E-184
  170 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION (cH. 
This part of their work will be treated in the chapter on 
the education of girls and women. 
We will take first the proposals which were finally 
passed into law by the Endowed Schools Act. The pro- 
cedure was similar to that adopted by the Universities 
and the Public Schools Acts. A special Commission—called 
the Endowed Schools Commission—was set up to approve 
new schemes for all the foundations not covered by the 
Public Schools Act and with powers so wide that it was 
said that it could convert a boys’ school in Northumber- 
land into a girls’ school in Cornwall, though of course it 
never did anything so revolutionary. Its powers were 
renewed several times and, after its immediate work was 
accomplished, they were transferred to an augmented 
Charity Commission, and later still in 1899 to the Board 
of Education, when that body was established. There was 
nothing absolutely novel to English law in the exercise 
of such a power: foundation deeds could already be altered, 
if they were clearly obsolete, by the Court of Chancery; 
but readers of Dickens know what the Court of Chancery 
was in those days, and fortunate would the institution be, 
having once applied to that Court to modify the con- 
ditions on which its funds were to be expended, if, when 
it emerged from the Court, there were still any funds to 
apply. Not only was the new procedure quick and cheap; 
but the new Commission felt at liberty to make changes 
more freely. The Act, for instance, ordered them, wherever 
possible, to make provision for girls’ as well as boys’ 
schools; and, where the funds of any foundation permitted, 
they did so. It is hardly likely that such an intention was 
ever in the minds of founders, though the contrary has 
been sometimes maintained. The Inquiry Commission had 
dealt with 782 grammar schools and 2175 endowed ele- 
mentary schools, but the latter were excluded from the 
Act and the subsequent scheme-making commission. 235 
schemes were made by the Commissioners before the 
transfer of their powers to the Charity Commissioners, 
though, as we shall see when we come to the life of Thring, 
a considerable opposition to their activities developed.
-P-A-G-E-185
vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 7 
This was a substantial work; for it meant that the scandals 
described in Chapter Iv were henceforth impossible and 
that a large body of schools began to do solid work, to 
send pupils to the universities, and to inherit the spirit 
which the scholastic generation that followed Arnold’s 
death had called into being. Between thirty and forty of 
these schools are now first-grade schools represented on 
the Headmasters’ Conference. 
The Commission was the first official body to recognise 
the policy of the “ladder.” It may come as a surprise to 
many readers to learn that this ideal had entered into 
practical politics so early: for it is often regarded as a 
vision in the mind of Huxley which has only materialised 
since 1902. It is true that the provisions of the Act did little 
directly to help in its realisation; secondary school exhibi- 
tions were hardly made obtainable in practice by elemen- 
tary school pupils, except where this was already the case; 
and in some instances, as at Bedford, where the number of 
free places was found to cause a neglect of elementary 
education, it was reduced. But, by improving the educa- 
tion in schools which were already available to elementary 
school pupils, it indirectly helped forward the policy of 
the ladder; for the Commission of 1895 was able to point 
to the actual successes of ex-elementary pupils at the 
universities and so to overcome the reluctance of English 
people to believe in the possibility of anything of which 
they have no practical experience. 
The results, as the Commission of 1895 discovered, were, 
however, a patchwork. In the first place, as regards the 
kind of school, the Commission reported that three grades 
were needed, first-grade with a leaving age of eighteen or 
nineteen and closely connected with the universities, 
second-grade with a leaving age of sixteen or seventeen, 
and third-grade with a leaving age of fourteen or fifteen. 
It must be remembered that Robert Lowe’s reactionary 
code of 1860 had practically fixed the leaving age for 
elementary schools at twelve, and that the last of these 
three grades, which later was partially supplied from the 
grants assigned to elementary education, was treated by
-P-A-G-E-186
  172 FIRST STATE INTERVENTION (cH. 
the Commissioners as unmistakably secondary. It was 
in regard to this third grade of school, which would be 
frequented by the children of small farmers, small shop- 
keepers and well-to-do artisans that the report discovered 
the greatest deficiency of supply and the most unsatis- 
factory character of the supply which was available. The 
classical curriculum of the local grammar school, consisting 
of elementary Latin and possibly “less Greek” (as in 
Shakespeare’s day), led to nothing and was in no demand; 
the gap was filled, so far as it was filled at all, by private 
schools, mostly inefficient. The numbers of pupils who 
might be expected to attend this grade of school were the 
largest of the three; and it was here that the Commission 
rightly judged that government aid was most imperative. 
It was here, however, that least was effected as the result 
of their report. The meagreness of the result cannot be 
put down altogether to public apathy or to ministerial lack 
of imagination. Two changes were necessary before this 
type of education could be stimulated and directed to 
a clear-cut aim. The first was the creation of provincial 
universities with a technical bent. Such universities offer 
a goal to which the pupils can aspire; they provide a 
supply of capable teachers; and finally they extend the 
influence of science over industry. The public was only 
beginning to realise in a very vague way the use of physical 
and chemical science to artisans; and the possibility that 
persons engaged in agriculture could profit by a scientific 
education was to the generality of agriculturists incon- 
ceivable. The second change therefore needed was the 
development of science teaching on sound lines. 
But the patchwork character of the result did not merely 
concern the unequal stimulus given to different types of 
schools: it was also marked as regards their geographical 
distribution. Educational endowments were in a large 
measure distributed in accordance with the distribution 
of wealth and population in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, 
and were deficient in areas which had then been either 
thinly inhabited, like the modern industrial areas of the 
North, or poor, like Wales. This inequality was only partly
-P-A-G-E-187
  
vi] THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS 173 
remedied by the work of the Commission. The deputy 
commissioner appointed by the Commission of 1895 to 
report on the schools of Lancashire handed in a map in 
which a dot was assigned to the abode of every boy 
attending Manchester Grammar School and showed that 
the number of dots appearing in any district was in inverse 
ratio to the adequacy of local provision. At St Helens, 
for instance, money which had been diverted to elementary 
education was found, when applied by the Commissioners 
to secondary purposes, sufficient to establish a really good 
school; and Bury Grammar School was praised for the fact 
that there boys of all social ranks mixed to a degree 
elsewhere unknown: but at Rochdale there was still in 
1895 only a school of nineteen boys and at Oldham the 
school had developed at a period much later than the Com- 
mission out of South Kensington grants. 
We now pass to the side of the report which was not 
carried into effect. Briefly it would have set up a system 
of State and local control. As originally drafted, the bill 
included the proposals for State but not for local control. 
An examining council was to be set up consisting of twelve 
persons, half nominated by the Crown and half by the 
Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London. This 
council would examine schools and also intending school- 
masters. In short it was to establish the Teachers’ Register 
which subsequently proved so thorny a question, and to 
introduce the thin edge of the wedge in the direction of 
securing the training of secondary teachers. These ideas 
were so novel to the ordinary member of parliament that 
they stood little chance of success. Beresford Hope voiced 
the general opinion of schoolmasters and the public when, 
in the discussion on the bill, he declared that surely a degree 
should be enough for a teacher! Even the 1895 Commission 
found a prevalence of this opinion. More reasonable was 
the view that an examination of schools would introduce 
and stereotype a system of “cramming.” To persons living 
in the heyday of Robert Lowe’s “ payment by results” no 
other opinion was possible, and the nearest approximations 
to a central examination system in the case of secondary

schools—the Central Welsh Board and its Irish counter- 
part—show that even thirty years later the importance 
of examining as opposed to inspecting might be over- 
emphasised. It is by no means certain therefore that the 
postponement of State control till inspection had received 
its proper recognition was not the lesser of two evils. As 
this section was omitted from the bill, a mild substitute 
was provided in most of the schemes approved by the 
subsequent Commissioners requiring that the schools 
should submit themselves to examination by some external 
authority, such for instance as the Universities by means 
of their Local Examinations or later by the Oxford and 
Cambridge Joint Board. 
The local authority was a feature on which the Com- 
missioners laid great stress, but it was not even mentioned 
in the bill. They had enquired into continental and colonial 
systems of secondary education and had before them 
Matthew Arnold’s valuable report. ‘Before all things the 
wishes of the parents and of the people at large must be 
met. The management should in some reasonable manner 
be in their hands. The people perhaps cannot give guidance, 
but they can give life, which is even more valuable than 
guidance.” In the last sentence the true basis of democratic 
control is laid down. In one sense democratic control is 
impossible. Not one man in a hundred has thought out 
an educational policy. Elected bodies, Parliament itself 
as much as any other, are not composed of educational 
experts, and the means which they propose to secure 
desirable results are often fantastic. They are too prone 
to think that enthusiasm and personal influence can be 
secured by ordering them to come into existence. If they 
delegate their powers to officials, we too often get a class 
of persons who regard themselves as experts by reason of 
a contact with education no closer than the other end of 
a telephone. But popular control, exercised on the spot 
and not entirely delegated to officials, has advantages 
entirely independent of the regulations which it ordains. 
It gives an opportunity for the few who have ideas to 
ventilate them; it provides a medium for the interchange
-P-A-G-E-189

of opinions between the teachers and the outside world; 
it educates administrators and parents; it creates an 
educational atmosphere. Where it exists, parents who 
would otherwise be indifferent become keen. The Com- 
missioners suggested quite a number of alternative plans 
on which such a local authority might be constituted, in all 
cases independent of any authority which might be created 
for elementary education; but the dread of possible harm 
felt by existing efficient schools was too strong for those 
who thereby hoped to create efficient schools where they did 
not already exist. It was at this moment too that we have 
the nearest approach to an incursion into the domain of 
secondary education of the “religious difficulty,’’ which 
did so much to hamper all attempts to improve elemen- 
tary education. Beresford Hope in the debate expressed 
alarm for the maintenance of the Church character of 
existing foundations, though a ‘‘conscience clause” and 
an exemption from any obligation upon holders of schol- 
astic posts to take Holy Orders were all which the bill 
offered in regard to the religious question. 
It is certain that the Commissioners proposed a State 
system of secondary education and that the State refused 
to undertake the burden. At first sight it would appear 
that a great chance was missed. Undoubtedly a modern 
House of Commons would adopt a very different policy. 
To some extent a supply will create a demand, but to do 
so the supply must be good. It is not certain that a State 
system imposed in 1869 by a progressive minority but 
administered by indifferent representatives of the average 
citizen would have been good. It is hardly a case for 
blame. You do not blame a savage or a man of the Middle 
Ages for being a savage or a man of the Middle Ages; you 
merely record what he was and what he thought and felt. 
Why do otherwise with a Mid-Victorian? He was a snob, 
but in many ways a very kindly person. He was an ultra- 
individualist, but he had a shrewd political sense. He 
had no idea of the application of school learning to industry, 
but he built up the industries to which it was subsequently 
applied. He had little aesthetic taste, but he produced

a race of writers for whom we have no substitutes. He did 
not realise the close connection of intellectual and moral 
development, but he had his own philistine morality. He 
did not appreciate the virtues of organisation, but he was 
not the slave of red tape. He did not try to evolve schemes 
for educating his neighbours’ children, but he discovered 
empirically what a good school is and left it as a legacy to 
the next generation to create more of them.

CHAPTER VII 
THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 
E have seen in the last chapter how the State, con- 
fronted with the task of organising secondary 
education, refused to take the leap. For forty years 
secondary schools, many of them, it is true, revived by 
the State, were conducted independently. During most of 
this period the headmasters regarded State interference 
as an overhanging peril which they must spend every effort 
to avert. Englishmen judge institutions as they work; 
and, judged by the working of a State department in the 
sphere of elementary education, the headmasters had 
reason on their side. From 186r till the nineties, elementary 
education groaned under a tyranny of mechanical routine. 
The official view was that elementary education was 
synonymous with the “three R’s.” It was something in 
which the formation of character, broadening of outlook, 
rousing of intellectual activity, training of mental habits 
—everything which the universities and public schools 
set forth as their aim—had no part. It could be judged 
by “results,” which, as Matthew Arnold said, ‘were 
an illusion.” The State had succeeded in subordinating 
teaching to an examination which did not test, in driving 
out every subject which could give nutriment to the mind, 
in deadening the pupils’ intelligence, in making drudges 
of the teachers, and in inventing a training for them based 
on the idea that, till you had turned a man into a machine, 
he would decline to do the machine-like grind which the 
Department expected of him. This was State education 
as it presented itself to Thring when he resisted it as the 
“dead hand.” 
It has been said that a nation generally gets the govern- 
ment which it deserves, and we suppose this is true of its 
education. How then came England to ‘“‘deserve” such 
A.S.E. 12

an education as this? Matthew Arnold, Ruskin, Maurice, 
Kingsley and the other prophets supply the answer. There 
was much that was noble in Victorian England; but it 
co-existed with a self-complaisance which it will be im- 
possible for future generations which have not grown up 
in it to understand. It was truly an age of prophets; for 
everyone to whom the gift of vision had been granted could 
find abundance of material against which to take up his 
parable. 
The nineteenth century accepted class distinctions as 
axiomatic. In this point at least all classes were agreed. 
Beyond it, the current of thought in Victorian times can 
only be understood by taking as a starting-point the in- 
herited tradition of the three great classes into which 
Matthew Arnold divided the nation. The working class 
was still prone to take its ideas from the other two classes, 
whom Matthew Arnold named the “barbarians” and the 
“‘philistines.”” Now-a-days we would fain believe that we 
have shaken off the belief in class distinctions. We are 
lavish in our use of the word “‘snobbishness.”’ It would be 
nearer the truth to say that we wish that we had shaken 
ourselves free of the belief, but feel that we have not. The 
modern phenomenon of an inverted snobbishness, the 
“class consciousness” of Marxism, is one proof among 
many that we have not. It is not easy therefore to treat 
the Mid-Victorian ideals in a dispassionate historical spirit ; 
but the true background of educational difficulties in the 
middle of the nineteenth century cannot be understood 
except by realising the good and bad features in the ideals 
of the “barbarians” and the “philistines” and their 
attitude to one another and to the working class. 
The “barbarian” set of ideals had a long pedigree. 
Feudalism, chivalry, the ‘‘courtly ideal” of Queen Eliza- 
beth’s age, the feelings of the cavaliers, the toryism and 
high churchmanship of Queen Anne’s time, had all left 
their mark upon it. This mode of thought had extended 
far beyond the landed aristocracy. It pervaded the Church, 
the professional classes, and the universities. The “ philis- 
tine” ideals were of later growth. They owed something
-P-A-G-E-193

vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 179 
to earlier Puritanism; but in their Victorian form they 
became recognisable only after the industrial revolution 
had created a powerful manufacturing class. Speaking 
generally, they were the ideas alike of the wealthy manu- 
facturer, the shop-keeper, and the clerk. All noncon- 
formists were “‘philistine” and not ‘barbarian,’ though 
all “‘philistines” were not nonconformists. Most “ philis- 
tines” were liberal in politics, and their liberalism was more 
usually of the “Manchester” brand than radical; most 
“barbarians” were conservatives, but, if they were liberals, 
it was almost always of the Whig brand. 
It cannot be said that the intellect made any great 
appeal to Victorian Englishmen as a body, whatever their 
class. When we speak of the educational ideals of a class, 
we are therefore thinking of a small minority of that class. 
In this sense the public school of 1868 represented the 
educational ideals of the “ barbarians.” Though the House 
of Commons tended to be dominated by the ideals of the 
“philistines,”’ the Royal Commissions, through the power- 
ful part played by the Church and the universities in 
educational matters, tended rather to represent the “‘bar- 
barian” point of view. We might therefore have expected 
that the ‘‘barbarian”’ would wish to educate other people’s 
children on the same lines as those on which he educated 
his own: and this is very much what in the long run has 
come to pass, for the “barbarian” code is at bottom based 
on the native instincts of the Englishman, developed in 
freedom from the restraints of circumstances and un- 
trammelled by opposing ideas. 
Why then did this not occur? Because of the exclusive- 
ness of the unintellectual majority in the class. The 
exclusiveness of the “barbarians” may not have been half 
so potent for evil as the race for wealth among the “‘ philis- 
tines”: the country squire did not alienate the workers to 
anything like the same degree as the self-made capitalist. 
All the same it cannot be denied that, tempered though it 
might be by Christianity, by patriotism, and by fellowship 
in sport, there was in the “barbarian” something of the 
old Greek feeling that the highest life was one which could 
12—2

  180 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS (CH. 
be lived free from “banausic” labour and that the hand- 
workers existed to make such a life possible for his own 
class. Their claim to a share in the good things of body and 
soul as a fair reward for accomplishing their raison d’étre 
was recognised—though they were too prone, as a class, 
to close their eyes to the evils of an industrialism with 
which few of them came into direct contact—but what the 
land-owning and professional classes never recognised was 
the claim of boys and girls born in the hand-working classes 
to the good things of the intellect. Possibly it was because 
the majority of “barbarians” did not appreciate them very 
much themselves. But in this respect the Victorian era 
contrasts unfavourably with the Middle Ages, when the 
Church gave an opportunity for a poor boy to rise to the 
highest rank which a subject could hold, an archbishopric, 
and to be the companion of kings. 
Besides this lower motive there was another aspect of 
“barbarian” exclusiveness which we must not overlook. 
Classes are always afraid of losing their ideals and are far 
more prone to keep their children segregated from those 
of other classes than to remain in isolation themselves. 
The “barbarian” really had much which we can admire, 
which he wished to hand on to his sons. The Hanoverian 
type, with which the present age can have little sympathy, 
was dying out. His Victorian successor was far superior. 
We knowjTom Brown’s father: admiration for his type 
leavened Charles Kingsley with an element of toryism, 
despite his zeal for social reform; Disraeli’s policy was to 
appeal from the mercenary instincts of the manufacturers 
to the sense of fair-play which he believed he could find 
in the squires. Honour and duty sum up the better side 
of their tradition. On this foundation the religious leaders 
of the century following the Wesleyan and Evangelical 
revivals sought to build a more self-conscious morality. 
Thomas Arnold had set himself to make the public schools 
instruments-in accomplishing this task. In those days, 
when such men as he talked of “a gentleman and a 
Christian,” they meant one in whom a sense of honour and 
a sense of duty had taken root from his earliest years and
-P-A-G-E-195
vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS r8r 
in whom the other virtues had been’ more consciously 
developed by Christian influences from this starting-point. 
If we had similarly to pick out the special virtues of other 
classes, we should probably select honesty and industry 
as the virtues of the “philistine,’ and helpfulness to 
distress as that of the worker. In a vague kind of way we 
believe that the ‘‘barbarian” felt that a mixture of classes 
might result in the complex possessing the virtues of none 
and the faults of all. Headmasters had learned how to 
build on the virtues of the young “barbarian” and wanted 
him segregated so that they could accomplish their 
task. 
The average “barbarian” was not much given to ab- 
stract thought, and it rarely occurred to him to consider 
how the young “‘philistine” and young worker ought to 
be educated. The public school headmaster had carried 
him away by force of character. Even the careless boy 
usually respected the “head”; and, when he grew up, even 
if he was a man of no great moral zeal, he wished his son 
to be educated by a man whom he respected. Members 
of parliament had thus a clear idea what the school to 
which they would send their own sons must be like. But 
they were not convinced that the same kind of schooling 
would suit any other class. As regards the young worker, 
they found an easy way out of their difficulty; they handed 
the matter over to the clerical members of their class, who 
had inherited the notion that what was needed was the 
Bible and the Catechism. It never seemed to occur to the 
clergy that the direct teaching of religion played only a 
small part in the Arnoldian “Christian education”: they 
went on valiantly struggling on the platform for religious 
teaching in the elementary school, regardless of the fact 
that it provided no counterpart for the other elements in 
Arnold’s training. Arnold emphasised the close connection 
of intellectual and moral education; but the moralising 
effect of broadening the intellectual horizon, outside the 
shape which it took in the public schools, was still to seek. 
The public school class on the whole saw through the 
pathetic fallacy, in which many “philistines” believed,
-P-A-G-E-196
182 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS [cH. 
that the knowledge of reading was by itself a moralising 
agency, but they had nothing more to offer. 
As regards the education of the young “ philistine” the 
“barbarian” was completely at a loss. He could not hand 
this over to the clerical members of his class; for the young 
“philistine’s”” parents were as often as not nonconformists, 
sometimes were free-thinkers, and nearly always took a 
point of view which the “barbarians” could not under- 
stand. 
What then of the standpoint of the adult “ philistine’’? 
On the whole he had more definitely formulated ideas than 
the ‘‘barbarian.” Unfortunately they were often narrow. 
Instinct is often a surer guide to conduct than ideas, 
especially second-hand ideas. The intolerance of a far-back 
age and the conservatism of recent days had denied the 
nonconformist, who constituted the backbone of the 
“philistine” class as far as strength of character and con- 
viction was concerned, a share in such liberal education 
as was provided in the recognised places of learning. The 
“philistines” of early Victorian days consequently lacked 
among their numbers the counterpart of the public school 
headmasters. Their ideas were largely borrowed and crude. 
The traditions of Puritanism rendered Art and most 
Literature suspect. Political ideas were borrowed freely 
from continental liberals; but other intellectual ideas from 
this source were tainted with infidelity. John Stuart Mill 
probably influenced the Oxford of the seventies and the 
small number of working men who were able to educate 
themselves by their own efforts far more than he influenced 
the genuine “philistine.”” The result was to leave the 
“philistine” class divided and educationally powerless. 
Many were won over by Arnold’s religious zeal to a belief 
in the public school system. Some were adherents of new 
and transient forms of education like George Combe’s. 
The majority were frankly utilitarian and kept their 
children at school no longer than was necessary to teach 
them commercial arithmetic and a little of informational 
subjects. As regards the education of the young workers 
the “‘philistine” was a firm believer in the three R’s, and
-P-A-G-E-197
  vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 183 
as regards that of the young “barbarians,” he washed his 
hands of it. Of the great movements in thought which 
reacted on education, the scientific movement was conse- 
quently the only one with which the “‘philistines” had 
any noteworthy connection. 
Finally, can the workers be said to have evolved any 
educational ideas? Of course we must expect to find a 
much smaller proportion of this class possessed of ideas 
than of the other two; for it required the sternest grit for 
a worker to find opportunity for getting them. This small 
hard-headed minority displayed great interest in education: 
Mechanics’ Institutes, Working-men’s Colleges, the co-opera- 
tive movement, and the educational side of the Chartist 
movement are evidence enough. But the time had not yet 
come when their policy could look beyond the elementary 
and lower technical sphere. They would support an edu- 
cational leader, when they found one, through thick and 
thin. They were more ready to set prejudices aside than 
either of the other classes. But for the present the leaders in 
working-class educational movements came from outside. 
This analysis of the educational ideals of the three 
classes into which for this purpose Victorian society may 
be divided is sufficient to explain why the State was unable 
as yet to establish a system of secondary education. The 
public school system was the only system worthy of the 
name; the public schoolmen gloried in having produced it 
without State interference; and the system of State educa- 
tion which the “ barbarians ” and “‘philistines”” had between 
them imposed on elementary schools was its direct anti- 
thesis and filled secondary schoolmasters with alarm. 
Obviously a very different attitude of mind all round must 
be produced before State secondary education could be 
a success. Hence the next stage requires explanation by 
forces which lay outside the school walls. We must ask 
ourselves what new elements have been added to the 
mental outfit of all classes which were lacking when Queen 
Victoria came to the throne, and it is convenient to label 
the process by which each of these elements was added as 
a “movement.”  
-P-A-G-E-198
184 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS [cH. 
The first was the scientific movement already discussed 
in Chapter v. It offered a new form of intellectual educa- 
tion; it presented education to the workers and to lower 
middle class parents in a form in which it seemed to be 
of practical ‘‘use”; it held out prospects to the manu- 
facturers, whose influence was perhaps stronger than that 
of any other class in the House of Commons, of obtaining 
more competent managers and more efficient “‘hands”’; it 
came as a relief to politicians who were expected to do 
something to maintain England’s commercial superiority. 
If Science was associated with a somewhat narrowly 
utilitarian view of education, it was partly because it 
turned into adherents of education persons who otherwise 
would not have been educationalists at all. Thus we see 
how it came to pass that for a time Science was regarded 
as solving the problem of educating the young “‘ philistine”’ 
while it hardly affected the education of the young “ bar- 
barian” for several decades. 
The second movement was the aesthetic. Matthew 
Arnold and Ruskin may be taken as its representatives. 
It was a reaction against “philistinism.’’ Puritanism had 
tended to regard all pleasures as evil. In the long run the 
“higher” pleasures were the losers. The ordinary man 
would not believe, for instance, that it was his duty to 
abstain from the pleasures of the table, which a heathen 
philosopher would certainly have classified as “‘lower”— 
besides, was not fasting a Romish superstition? But he 
was quite willing to abandon music, painting, sculpture, 
and architecture—besides, were not these the vehicles of 
Romish worship? Even literature should only be enjoyed 
within the narrow limits where it made for edification; 
and the love of natural scenery, though not formally con- 
demned, shared in the general loss of the aesthetic sense. 
Evangelicalism in its origin was not like Puritanism, based 
on a mixture of legalism and asceticism; planted in a 
different soil, it would naturally have encouraged Luther’s 
love of music and St Francis’s feeling for nature: but most 
Evangelicals inherited a strain of Puritanism in their 
spiritual pedigree. Moreover, the basefpurposes to which
-P-A-G-E-199
  
vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 185 
art and literature had been put wherever neo-Paganism 
had prevailed since the Renaissance blinded them to their 
nobler uses; while a suspicion of Romanism prevented the 
use of art by religion, without which it first became 
ssecularised and then demoralised. 
Matthew Arnold (1822-1888) is peculiarly interesting to 
us because he was both educationalist and prophet and 
because he succeeded in influencing the education of the 
succeeding generation by his work as a prophet, whefeas 
he failed to influence that of his own generation by his 
professional work as an educationalist. His educational 
views were the direct outcome of his attitude as a prophet, 
and they can be read in the present age with approval. But 
they were in advance of his time and, though what he 
wrote was highly valued by Royal Commissions and by 
educational reformers, as far as immediate effect on edu- 
cational legislation and administration was concerned he 
was a voice crying in the wilderness. What better proof 
can we have that educational advance is due to the efforts 
of individuals than this instance of the State appointing 
a man of genius as one of its educational officials and then 
finding that he re-shaped educational ideas during his 
leisure hours devoted to literary criticism, while his official 
work largely consisted in ineffectively denouncing the 
policy of his official superiors! 
Arnold was, as we might imagine, a thorough product of 
the classical movement, and came under many of its 
varied influences. His schooling at Rugby was responsible 
for the serious attitude to life which underlay a somewhat 
light and bantering mode of expression; to it may be 
attributed that view of literature as a criticism of life 
which at first sight appears more consonant with the 
outlook of a moralist like Plato than of an apostle of beauty 
like Arnold. As scholar of Balliol and fellow of Oriel he 
came under the more critical elements in the many-sided 
humanistic movement: above all he was filled by enthu- 
siasm for the Greek spirit and set its love of “sweetness 
and light” in opposition to the unlovely compound of 
Puritanism and money-making for which he employed the 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS [cH. 
undying name of ‘“‘philistinism.’’ Chance made him an 
educationalist by profession; for, after a short career as 
an assistant master at Rugby, he was offered the post of 
private secretary to the Marquis of Lansdowne who, as 
Lord President of the Council, was responsible for educa- 
tion; and in 1851 he was appointed an inspector of schools. 
His vigorous attacks in his Reports on Elementary Schools 
upon the system of payment by results at a time when 
ex@mination was an obsession in the minds of educational 
administrators almost brought about his resignation; but 
this part of his work belongs to the volume on the history 
of elementary education. In secondary education he was 
one of those who, in their reaction against British insularity. 
strove to awake the country to the superior merits of 
continental systems. He was employed by the Royal 
Commissions to investigate continental education on the 
spot; the task was highly congenial to him, and he became 
the recognised authority in England on the subject. His 
publications were Popular Education of France (1861), 
A French Eton (1864), and Schools and Universities on the 
Continent (1868). We have seen how his conclusions as to 
the grave deficiency of middle-class schools and the need 
of State intervention as the only means of supplying it 
were adopted by the Schools Inquiry Commission but 
fell on deaf ears in Parliament and failed to produce any 
immediate result. Though very necessary at the time, this 
tendency to look abroad for educational guidance was not 
an unmixed blessing at a later date; for it tended to sub- 
stitute imitation for thought and to place industrious 
compilers in the seats of authority over public opinion 
where creative genius was needed. It also irritated the 
teachers of the older universities and public schools to 
be constantly told that all good things in education were 
made in France and Germany; and conservatism was 
fostered by the failure of some of its opponents to see that 
a national education must be based on a foundation of 
national aspirations and traditions. 
But it was as the author of Culture and Anarchy (1869) 
and in his various critical writings that he did his most
-P-A-G-E-201
  vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 187 
real educational work. His influence was quite as strong 
in intellectualising the “barbarians” as in leavening the 
“‘philistines”” with sweetness and light. He thus tilled the 
soil in which the educational seeds which he sowed could 
ultimately take root. He lived in the heyday of the scientific 
movement—if we mean by the movement the crusade for 
spreading the teaching of science rather than the results 
of that crusade. His criticism of the movement was far 
more effective than the opposition of theologians or the 
academic opinions of faculty psychologists, because there 
was nothing obscurantist in his ground of attack. He 
approached the problem from the point of view of the 
pupil who had to be educated, a point of view which was 
liable to be disregarded so long as attention was fixed on 
the character of the subject-matter. His experience brought 
him into contact with elementary school pupils and 
students in training as teachers, so that the humanities 
had for him a wider meaning than the classics of the public 
schools. He was the first man insistently to voice the need 
of a literary element in the training of working men and the 
middle classes. ‘‘The only use the Government makes of 
the mighty engine of literature in the education of the 
working classes amounts to little more, even when most 
successful, than giving the power to read the newspapers!.” 
“The animation of mind, the multiplying of ideas, the 
promptness to connect in the thoughts one thing with 
another and to illustrate one thing by another, are what 
are wanted; just what letters, as they are called, are 
supposed to communicate?.”” In 1876 he ended his report 
by replying to a speech made on behalf of the teaching of 
science at the meeting of the British Association. ‘“What- 
ever else,” the speeches had said, “a man may know, 
viewed in the light of modern necessities, a man who is 
not versed in exact science is only a half-educated man, 
and, if he has substituted literature and history for natural 
science, he has chosen the less useful alternative.’ Matthew 
Arnold replies by quoting paraphrases of a passage in

Macbeth written by students in a training college as a 
proof of what a failure to teach English may produce. 
He adds that to make people obey the laws of health 
a knowledge of science is not enough. “To have the power 
of using (which is the thing wished) these data of science, 
a man must in general have first been in some measure 
moralised, and for moralising him it will not be found easy, 
I think, to dispense with those old agents, letters, poetry, 
religion?.”’ 
It is doubtful, however, if Matthew Arnold had been in 
the position of an educational dictator and had been able 
‘to impose on the schools the means which he thought 
necessary to effect his aims, whether he would have been 
successful. He still clung to the old faculty psychology 
enough to believe that English grammar was needed in 
elementary schools to fill the place of Latin in secondary 
schools; and surely science has rarely been so little of a 
civilising agent as the technicalities of so-called English 
grammar usually are. He firmly believed in making 
children and students in training colleges learn poetry by 
heart, regardless of the fact that such a course may inspire 
a life-long hatred of poetry in the victims. And, when his 
campaign had won examining bodies to his side and English 
literature became a regular subject in secondary schools, 
what a travesty of his intentions did it become! It is 
probably true that far more valuable study of literature 
took place in public schools in the old days when classics 
were the only regular subject of the curriculum, when 
examinations were unknown and when boys were guided 
in their leisure reading, than is usually found in any type 
of boys’ school—in many girls’ schools it is happily 
different—where English is taught as an examination 
subject. The truth is that, given a teacher who really loves 
literature, whether he has ever passed an examination in 
it or not, his pupils will read and read in the right way; 
but that, given a teacher, however high honours he may 
have taken in English, who approaches it as school “ busi- 
ness,” it would be much better that he should not “teach

literature” at all. Arnold’s real glory is in having spread 
a love of literature ainongst many who would never other- 
wise have felt it and so increased the probability of the 
right kind of teachers being found. 
Ruskin (1819-1900), albeit that his direct educational 
views are fanciful, was in some ways the greatest indirect 
force on education during the century. It is almost true 
to say that before his time art was to the “ philistines” 
a stumbling-block and to the “ barbarians” and the workers 
foolishness. Of course he neither created the Gothic revival 
nor the pre-Raphaelite school of painters. But he did some- 
thing far wider. From the Renaissance art had been aristo- 
cratic and in England confined to a small minority of the 
aristocracy. Since it had been taken from the religious soil 
in which it had flourished in the Middle Ages it had been 
a hothouse exotic. Deep in the English heart is a love of 
nature: classicism had for over a century divorced art 
from nature: and what the romantic movement did for 
literature, that Ruskin did for art. Here then are the 
three things which Ruskin did; he re-united art to craft, 
he re-united it to religion, he re-united it to the love of 
nature. The “‘fine arts”’ were no longer to be regarded as 
a hobby of ostentatious princelets and idle aristocrats, but 
as the invention of artist artisans. They were to be asso- 
ciated not with the Quartier Latin and its bohemianism 
but with the builders of cathedrals in the ages of faith. 
Art was not artificiality; it was to be won by studying the 
trees of the forest and the flowers of the field. Ruskin 
treated art as Matthew Arnold treated literature—as one of 
the moralising agencies. As soon as this change of attitude 
became at all general, art was bound to become an instru- 
ment of education. The earlier teaching of drawing and of 
arts and crafts had been purely utilitarian, and confined to 
those to whom skill and a sense of beauty were to become 
commercial assets. Henceforward it was to bea part of the 
education of all, necessary to a full development of human 
nature, to the enjoyment of life, and to the banishing of 
sordid, morbid and petty attitudes, and, like language, a 
medium of expression and a carrier of thought and feeling.
-P-A-G-E-204
  190 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS [cH 
But Ruskin did something even greater than setting up 
art as the companion of literature in the sphere of educa- 
tion. He did more than any individual—though it is little 
that a single individual can do in this direction—to break 
down class exclusiveness. The basis of class distinctions 
is the belief that there is something “ banausic” in manual 
work or that a life of leisure is necessary for developing the 
higher qualities in human nature. Ruskin did not succeed 
in showing how, under present conditions, it is possible 
for every man to develop his whole being. In the old Greek 
days when practically the only source of mechanical power, 
save for a little use of other beasts of burden, was man 
himself, slavery, open or disguised, was probably the one 
basis on which a cultured free society could be built up. 
Machinery would appear, from the point of view of purely 
mechanical science, to have solved the difficulty, by 
reducing the amount of muscular work which was necessary 
in the old days to manageable proportions. But, directly 
the laws of nature had been converted into allies, the laws 
of political economy seemed to spring up with hydra-like 
multiplicity; and the problem appeared more desperate 
than before mechanical sources of power had been dis- 
covered. In his titanic struggle with the economic hydra 
Ruskin wore out body and brain, and the end is not yet. 
He dared to contemplate and to feel in its fulness a prob- 
lem which, fully realised, must make the head reel and, 
fully felt, must make the heart melt as wax, namely, that 
we do not yet know how to enable the bulk of mankind to 
be what we feel that their possibilities mean them to be 
and that, so far as we ourselves are able to approach the 
ideal, it is by the sweat of the brow, the deadening of the 
sensibilities, and the loss of the capacity of living, of other 
men. The agony of Ruskin’s yearning cannot be realised 
by the ‘‘philistine” who does not know of these lost 
possibilities, by the revolutionary who believes that the 
favoured classes could give them if they would, or by the 
socialist who thinks he has a panacea which will shortly be 
applied. What Ruskin succeeded in doing was, first, to 
make his contemporaries see that we must never rest till
-P-A-G-E-205
vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS IQl 
the solution is found and that, in proportion as we recog- 
nise our duty, we shall cause society to approximate more 
closely to the ideal; secondly, to proclaim a ground of hope, 
to be drawn from the fact that, though most work is a bar 
to the higher life under present conditions, yet all idleness 
is a bar by its very nature. When God made man in His 
own image, He made him a creator; his instinct as a child 
is to create; and he can never properly see that the larger 
creation of God or the smaller creations of men are very 
good till he has in some measure exercised his creative 
powers. The notion that human superiority is to be based, 
not on capacity for intellectual work, which may make it 
quite desirable that a judge, for instance, should not spend 
too much of his time on manual work, but on the mere 
fact of never having done any serious manual work, was 
shown up as destructive of art, an ignoring of human 
nature, and blasphemy against God. The paganism of the 
Renaissance was now detected in its last hiding-place. 
While Jupiter feasted in his palace on Olympus, man was 
godlike in so far as he did the same. The Christian concept 
is, “My Father worketh...and I work.” In some way or 
another the goal to which progress must tend is one where 
all work is done in the spirit of the artist, aims at the 
perfection of the artist, and arouses the joy of the artist. 
Then will the worker be the full perfection of manhood. 
Obviously the first step towards the ideal, so far as edu- 
cational machinery is concerned, lay with the elementary 
school; for little could be done with the adult workmen if the 
foundations were not truly and wisely laid. Hence he fre- 
quently returns to the demand for a free and compulsory 
education, physical, moral, and manual!. His idea of the 
school is, however, so bound upwith his views of the relation 
of the State to industry that it would take too much space 
to consider it here. Secondary education has been influenced 
more by the corollaries from his teaching on the part which 
art, handicraft, and a love of nature should play in life 
than by deductions arising from his economic writings.

  192 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS (cH. 
Amongst the corollaries which he himself definitely drew 
were the necessity of beautiful class-rooms and the use of 
paintings in teaching pupils to understand the past!; the 
teaching of a trade to boys of all ranks®, a conclusion at 
which he would probably have arrived even if it had never 
been expounded before; the place of science in education, 
which we have discussed in a previous chapter; the value 
of nature-study?, at that time an unknown subject for 
which not even a name had been found; and the necessity 
of putting girls’ education on a foundation on which it 
could build for real development and not for display4. He 
must have startled schoolmasters of that day by pro- 
claiming ‘‘all emulation to be a false motive and all giving 
of prizes a false means,” another echo of Rousseau, and a 
view which almost necessarily goes with Ruskin’s elimina- 
tion of competition in the economic sphere. Emulation 
never receives fair treatment from men who have not 
played games; they have never felt it in its healthiest form. 
But these direct educational passages are of minor im- 
portance; Ruskin’s real influence on education would have 
followed from his general outlook on life equally if he had 
not written a word directly on the subject. 
Though we began considering Ruskin’s work as a con- 
tribution to the aesthetic movement, it has led us on to 
a third movement, for which it is somewhat hard to find 
a name, which is represented by Frederick Denison Maurice 
and Charles Kingsley. It was a religious reaction against 
the individualism of Puritanism and even of Evangelicalism. 
Industrialism had naturally fostered men’s money- 
getting instincts; and, since money-getting is facilitated 
by banishing ease and living laborious days, persons of 
puritanical descent and tendency were generally well to 
the fore in the race for wealth and were inclined to “‘com- 
pound for sins they were inclin’d to by damning those they 
have no mind to.”’ The continental conception of English-

men as a race of hypocrites is of course a gross exaggeration: 
but it remains true that among the Victorians thrift, 
attention to business, and perseverance were as often 
degraded into vices as was an excessive love of ease. No 
time in fact was left for the higher pleasures: and the 
unvaried relation of competition was hardly likely to 
foster the generous instincts towards their fellow men. The 
results, in the case of the orthodox, were uncharitableness 
and gloominess in the less buoyant natures, anda restriction 
of outlook in all; while among those who were brought up 
in this atmosphere and found the yoke of orthodoxy too 
hard there was naturally a reaction towards the lower 
pleasures. Among the working classes too it created a 
tendency to regard respectability as a class code evolved 
for the furtherance of amassing capital in the hands of that 
class. Is it not a curious fact that in Mohammedan, Bud- 
dhist, and Jewish communities, and in Mediaeval Europe, 
a strict fulfilment of the accepted moral code has always 
earned a certain measure of respect from the laxer members 
of society, but in modern Western Europe alone has it been 
a cause of ridicule and contempt among many individuals 
of every class and a majority of individuals in particular 
classes? Surely the basis of the difference must be this: 
the laxer Mohammedan or Buddhist somehow feels that 
his more devout co-religionist is seeking his neighbour’s 
good while the laxer Westerner suspects that he is seeking 
his own good. 
The movement, then, which we are considering protested 
against the conception of religion as a process of “saving 
one’s soul ””—that is saving it, not from selfishness and sin, 
but from their physical punishments in the hell of popular 
theology—and represented it as a process of developing 
love of God and love of one’s neighbour through and by 
means of one another. It held up religion as something 
social. From a social state of mind social conduct must 
result. Social reform of all kinds was constantly in the 
minds of this school. Sanitation, housing, conditions of 
work, opportunities for recreation, thrift, all received their 
attention. To these men education had a new meaning 
ALS. E. 13

  194 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS [cH. 
which it did not possess to its ordinary clerical advocate. 
The latter divided education strictly into secular and 
religious; the former was only an indirect while the latter 
was a direct means of saving souls. Secular education had 
three uses: first, if administered in very small doses, it 
made a man a better economic producer; secondly, it gave 
him certain intellectual tools for understanding religious 
truths; thirdly, if education were given by the right per- 
sons, it exposed the pupil to the influences which would 
make for the acceptance of sound religious principles. But 
in itself it was no better to be educated than to be unedu- 
cated. To the school of Maurice and Kingsley secular and 
religious education were alike holy. They conceived Heaven 
as a state where every faculty which is born in man will 
be developed to a point beyond our present conceptions, in 
perfect harmony with every other faculty, and with the 
purpose of God and the blessedness of all His creatures; 
and, as Man is a “social animal,” the social and altruistic 
faculties would constitute an important element in his 
redeemed manhood, in which intellect and the sense of 
beauty would somehow conduce ad maiorem gloriam Dei. 
Earth was a training school for Heaven; and men would 
only be able to enter the preparatory class in Heaven if 
they were sent there in a state of lop-sided development. 
* “Whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth shall be bound in 
Heaven.” The words had an awful significance to those 
who interpreted their priestly commission in this sense. 
Not merely do ignorance and the cramping of parts of 
our nature lead to sin; they are themselves duapria, a 
missing of the mark which man is meant to hit. So far as 
the Christian Church allows conditions to exist which 
cramp man’s development and fail to educate him, it is 
“pbinding him on Earth.” 
This movement touched others at many points. It does 
indeed embrace a “social” movement in education, but 
it is so much wider that we have hesitated to call it by such 
a name. It touches the scientific movement, especially in 
the case of Kingsley—one of those natures to whom “the 
Earth is the Lord’s,” who was more likely to picture
-P-A-G-E-209
> vir] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 195 
himself in Heaven with a geologist’s hammer than with 
a harp, ever learning more and more, in Milton’s phrase, 
“to know God through His works.’ It touches the aes- 
thetic movement so closely as to turn the feeling of beauty 
into one of adoration. It touches the hygienic movement, 
for our bodies are ‘“‘the temples of the Holy Spirit”; and 
Kingsley “wishes to think” with the mystics that somehow 
our minds create our bodies and not our bodies our minds. 
F. D. Maurice was the son of a unitarian minister. He 
was educated at Cambridge in the days when it was 
possible for a nonconformist to study at that university 
but not to take its degree, which involved subscription to 
the Thirty-nine Articles. He spent the next few years in 
London as a journalist, but gradually came to a belief in 
the tenets of the Church of England; and it is character- 
istic of the man that he joined the Church at a time when 
he had no material benefit to derive from the act, though 
a few years earlier he could have retained his scholarship 
at Trinity Hall by subscription. He now went up to Oxford 
and in 1833, after taking his degree, was ordained to a 
country curacy at Bubbenhall in Warwickshire. It is 
strange to think that he was actually put forward as a 
candidate for the chair of political economy at Oxford by 
the Tractarians. As he was clearly not an evangelical, they 
concluded that he must necessarily incline to their own 
school of thought. On his real views becoming known, 
his name was hurriedly withdrawn. In 1840 he was ap- 
pointed professor of English literature and modern history 
at King’s College, London; and in 1845 theology was also 
assigned to him. 
Hitherto his interests had been mainly religious and 
educational, but the Chartist movement of 1848 made a 
deep impression on him. Though doctrinally he was a 
convinced churchman, having definitely broken with the 
unitarianism in which he had been brought up and holding 
Calvinism in horror, he had not inherited the tory tradi- 
tions which in these days were dominant among the clergy. 
He faced the situation in an attitude of fearless enquiry 
and came to the conclusion that the dissatisfaction of the 
8
-P-A-G-E-210
  196 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS [cH. 
working classes with the existing order was justified. He 
saw as clearly as his panic-stricken colleagues that Chartism 
was the lineal descendant of the French revolutionary 
movement and that the religious beliefs of most of its 
leaders were those of Tom Paine. But he believed, what 
his colleagues did not believe, that, though the Chartists 
did not support Christianity, Christianity supported them, 
and that the brotherhood preached by Christ was no more 
a form of words than the fraternity proclaimed by the 
followers of Rousseau. He set himself the double aim of 
making Christians of Chartists and making social reformers 
of Christians. On December 7th began the meetings of that 
band of enthusiasts who acquired the name of Christian 
Socialists. From May he had been publishing a series of 
penny pamphlets entitled Politics for the People, to which 
Charles Kingsley contributed under the title of Parson Lot. 
He started an adult school in Little Ormond Yard, ‘‘a place 
so disorderly that no policeman liked to venture there alone 
at night,” and Tom Hughes helped in the teaching. He 
threw himself vigorously into the co-operative movement. 
The following year came the cholera, and sanitation be- 
came an important plank in his social programme. In 1850 
the tailors formed a Working Men’s Association, and a 
Society of Working Men’s Associations was rapidly 
developed, the principles of which Maurice explained and 
defended in his Tvacts on Christian Socialism. Soon after, 
his social activities were disturbed by an attack on his 
religious views arising out of his criticism of the prevailing 
belief in regard to eternal punishment. Maurice was 
victorious in so far as he obtained from the law-courts a 
decision that acceptance of the generally accepted belief 
was not required of clergy either by the Prayer-book or 
by any other lawful authority; but it cost him his pro- 
fessorships. 
This, however, left him the more fae to carry on his 
social programme, and in 1854 he formed his Working 
Men’s College. The Mechanics’ Institutes, which have been 
described in a previous chapter, had passed their zenith. 
They had struck on the rock which prevented Maurice’s
-P-A-G-E-211
_— 
vil] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 197 
own institutions from becoming a permanent part of the 
educational machinery of the country, the lack of previous 
training. Both movements left behind them a certain 
number of institutions which in modern times, when this 
difficulty had been removed, have been absorbed in the 
technical system of later days. But, even had they been 
still flourishing, they would not have fulfilled Maurice’s 
purpose. Their aims were too utilitarian and informational ; 
Maurice sought rather those studies which would humanise 
and moralise. The ‘‘College” was taught by volunteers 
such as Ruskin, Alexander Monro, Woolner, Lowes Dickin- 
son, Rossetti, Frederic Harrison, W. J. Brodribb, C. H. 
Pearson and Grant Duff, a list sufficient to show that it 
was animated by no spirit of religious exclusiveness. He 
was helped by a stream of young men from the universities 
such as at a later time carried on the work of Toynbee Hall 
or the Oxford House in Bethnal Green. Maurice’s boldness 
in refusing to compromise with convention, where com- 
pliance was opposed to what he believed to be the truth or 
the general welfare, is shown in his stand on the matter of 
Sunday pursuits and recreations, which was a very vital 
question in the case of manual workers who were hard at 
work all the week. His attitude is so much commoner to- 
day that it is hard to realise that no “respectable” person, 
unless he were inspired by deep religious conviction, would 
then venture to attack Sabbatarianism. A hard-drinking, 
hard-swearing, loose-moraled, gambling mid-Victorian 
would have regarded anyone who suggested playing 
cricket on Sunday as outside the pale. Maurice never sought 
conflicts but, when the success of any cause which he prized 
was at stake, he never flinched from them: and in this case 
he felt that he was following not merely the general tenour 
of his Master’s principles, but His direct precedent on at 
least three occasions. “I have felt,” he wrote, “that a 
Working College, if it is to do anything, must be in direct 
hostility to the Secularists—that is to say, must assert 
that as its foundation principle which they are denying. 
But to do this effectively it must also be in direct hostility 
to the Religionists—that is to say, it must assert the
-P-A-G-E-212
  198 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS __[cu. 
principle that God is to be sought and honoured in every 
pursuit, not merely in something technically called reli- 
gion. 
Maurice’s work was twofold. With the exception of 
St Francis there is hardly any man since the first three 
centuries of Christianity of whom it is as true to say “To 
the poor the gospel is preached.” Hanoverian official 
religion was exploded. The difference between an evangeli- 
cal like Westcott and a high-churchman like Gore in 
succeeding days is a trifle compared with the gulf which 
yawns between them and a Georgian pluralist. His second 
task, however, was to put education in the forefront of the 
social movement. When society is all wrong and seditious 
discontent is rife, education is almost the last thing which 
the dissatisfied demand. More food, better clothes, more 
pay, less work, more amusement, all come first. Yet in a 
sense education is both the means to these things and their 
end. By increasing a man’s value as a worker it helps to 
improve his material position. When he has acquired 
means of sustenance and leisure, it enables him to enjoy 
his leisure. It enables him to live fully; and without this 
knowledge increased wages are of little value. Changes 
in wages only alter the distribution of the good things of 
life: education actually multiplies them. We are at the 
present time sufficiently familiar with kinds of unrest 
which, while searching to produce universal happiness, 
run the risk of producing universal misery; but, if the 
unrest of the “fifties ’‘ had not been turned into a healthier 
direction, we might now be in the condition of Russia. 
Christian Socialism did not create much in the way of 
educational machinery, but it produced an attitude of 
mind. Governments came to realise that, though education 
was not what the workers were consciously seeking, it 
would, when once they had obtained it, do more than many 
more popular demands to satisfy their unconscious cravings; 
and working men themselves came to aspire after it. The 
foundation was laid of the belief that is now becoming 
widespread that no human being’s education should end 
with the elementary school.
-P-A-G-E-213
  vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 199 
The fourth movement for us to consider is the hygienic. 
It was immediately occasioned by the bad sanitary con- 
ditions which resulted from the uncontrolled growth of 
towns after the Industrial Revolution and especially by 
the visitations of cholera. But it has a wider significance; 
it represents the passing of an age-long attitude of mind 
and the spread of an attitude which, except to small 
intellectual minorities, had been previously unknown, but 
once accepted, alters the whole mode of looking at the 
physical world. This is the scientific aspect of the move- 
ment. Of course in all ages, man has been compelled, in 
order to adjust himself to his natural environment, to 
acknowledge some sort of uniformity in nature; empirical 
agriculture and empirical medicine both imply such a 
belief. But, the further we go back, the more we find 
mankind believing in a multitude of variable factors 
entering into the result along with a few invariable uni- 
formities. The weather and disease are so elusive that 
popular opinion continued to regard them as such variables 
long after it had acknowledged many of their companions 
as subject to law. We would hesitate to define the scientific 
spirit in terms which suggested that it totally denied such 
variable factors—the existence of conscious beings by 
itself introduces one such factor: nor, in regard to disease, 
does the scientific spirit, in the best sense, deny the effect 
of mental condition on bodily health. The scientific attitude 
of mind, however, believes that, apart from such mental 
influences, disease will obey physical laws as fully as a 
material body, apart from the operation of the human 
mind on human muscles, will obey the law of gravitation. 
It is an attitude totally opposed to two beliefs, one or 
other of which has satisfied popular thought in all past 
ages, that the weather and disease are either the sport of 
“chance” or else in a special sense ‘“‘acts of God.” But 
pure intellect has no driving-power (vots odd «wwei); as 
a cold philosophic belief the uniformity of nature would 
have made few converts among the masses. Yet cholera 
showed the need that it should be believed; it soon became 
apparent that the most serious obstacle to the adoption
-P-A-G-E-214
eee 
200 THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS [cH. 
of hygienic habits was the incapacity of the bulk of the 
population to think in a scientific manner. Unless people 
are habituated to think in terms of cause and effect all 
round, they will not do so in regard to some one specific 
matter where at any particular moment it is needed. Thus 
it came to pass that a movement which originated in science 
became associated with the social and philanthropic 
activities and the religious opinions of Maurice and Kings- 
ley. With the theory of chance science could deal easily, 
for, while it had many adherents, it had no devotees. But 
with the theory of “act of God” it was different; strange 
as it seems now, there were in those days many who 
regarded sanitary measures as a direct attempt to resist 
the decrees of Providence. Against such Kingsley was the 
best fighter who could be found. The cause enlisted two 
of the strongest elements in his*nature—his social sym- 
pathies, and his enthusiasm for mens sana in corpore sano 
as the ideal of the entire man. Born a naturalist, a sports- 
man, and a lover of the country, he detested equally the 
view that science is irreligious, the identification of bodily 
feebleness with spiritual strength, and the existence of 
slums. His attitude on the second point was so specially 
his own that it was accepted as his main contribution to 
contemporary thought; he was spoken of as the inventor 
of “muscular Christianity.’ It is easy to see that the 
popular imagination would easily be seized at the sight of 
a parson playing cricket on Sunday afternoon with the 
lads to whom he had preached in the morning, or setting 
out in the middle of service at the head of his congregation 
to put out a fire in the pine woods. 
Medical science and “‘muscular Christianity” have 
between them had a considerable effect on education. 
Though it is a far cry to the Medical Inspection Act of 1907, 
men of science and followers of Kingsley both began to 
demand hygienic instruction in schools. Not that even 
now do we consider the problem has been solved. Matthew 
Arnold showed up the futility of the physiological teaching 
in elementary schools which was put in to satisfy the 
demand. Most of the modern teaching of hygiene is 
   
-P-A-G-E-215
  
vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 201 
equally academic. The general diffusion of a scientific spirit 
through the whole of education appears hope doing more 
than the specific teaching of hygiene. Making games an 
integral part of education was an easier task. In the public 
schools they had grown up of their own accord; and the 
example of the public schools has infected the whole nation. 
The “barbarians” of course always loved sport. Before 
they rowed or played cricket, long before they played 
football, they had hunted and shot. At school they fought 
with their fists; and that ardent muscular Christian Thomas 
Hughes was by no means ashamed that, as Tom Brown, 
he had fought with a future cleric, “Slogger Williams.” 
But no headmaster of 1800 regarded school games as any- 
thing but a concession to human frailty which unfortunately 
would not allow boys of twelve to study at all hours when 
they were not sleeping or eating. The dangers of over- 
athleticism which we recognise in 1920 had not become 
pronounced during Kingsley’s lifetime, and the headmaster 
of 1860 had come to regard games not merely as excellent 
means of promoting health, or as a harmless way of 
occupying leisure hours, or as a safety-valve, but as a 
direct and important element in moral training. Dons were 
not quite so unanimous; but the unbelievers were dis- 
missed as old-fashioned or as oddities or as admirers of 
things foreign, especially of German universities. By the 
eighties every player of Rugby football had come to believe 
at the bottom of his heart that the boy or man who had 
never dropped on the ball at the feet of an opposing rush, 
or found himself, two minutes before time and with a try to 
win, pushing in a scrum on his opponents’ line, had never 
truly lived. Even though the war has made such things 
seem child’s play, he probably still believes, that whatever 
the playing-fields of Eton (on which Rugby football was 
certainly not played) did for Waterloo, his game doubtless 
won this war. To the spectator from Mars all this would 
no doubt appear sufficiently absurd; but man is very 
human, and surely these deep, bedrock, primeval instincts, 
before which self-interest seems utterly forgotten and the 
thing to be done seems of transcendent importance, are

not of the ape and tiger but of the man, not to be crushed 
but to be used, not something devilish but an inexhaustible 
hidden spring whence altruism, determination, nay heroism 
may be drawn. 
It would doubtless be possible to mention other influences 
which helped to mould the attitude of different classes of 
Englishmen to education, but none, we venture to think, 
are as important as these four. 
The High Church movement, for instance, might be 
expected to have had a wide influence through the many 
headmasters who have been devout high churchmen, 
These men have undoubtedly done much to spread both 
the sense of social duty which we have considered in con- 
nection with Maurice and the methods of school govern- 
ment associated with the name of Arnold; but it does not 
seem easy to fix on any specific educational ideal which we 
can associate with the followers of Newman and Pusey. 
Nor does it seem possible to regard the democratic 
movement, apart from the social movement, as having 
produced as much effect as might have been expected. 
Properly speaking, democracy is a theory of government 
“by the people and for the people.” A logical connection 
there certainly is between political democracy and social 
reform. A practical connection does not necessarily follow. 
Now that political democracy has been established for 
some little time, the Labour party is beginning to put 
forward an educational policy. But hitherto the influence 
of educational questions has been negligible at elections, 
except where the “religious difficulty” has been brought 
in; and, till the introduction of Mr Fisher’s Bill of 1918, 
education debates were usually conducted in an empty 
house. Not until the working man had been given a taste 
of education was he likely to ask for more; and it was 
Robert Lowe, the very man who on the granting of the 
vote to the working man remarked “‘ Now we must educate 
our masters,’ who showed as minister of education that 
his whole conception of schooling consisted in the “three 
R’s.” The truth is that you may be a democrat for one of 
two reasons. You may believe in the equal claims of all
-P-A-G-E-217
vit] THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS 203 
men to be able to develop their possibilities to the utmost, 
and you may regard the vote as a means to this end; but, 
if you believe this, you are an educationalist before you 
are a democrat; your democracy is a corollary. Or you 
may be a democrat because it is the line of least resistance, 
as for instance if you believe that you will ultimately have 
to choose between extending the franchise and a revolution. 
Then you are an opportunist democrat; and education 
needed zealots, not opportunists. Possibly we ought to 
add a third class, those who accepted democratic formulae 
as they accepted other facts and theories about which they 
had never thought. And it would be hard to finda Victorian 
statesman of the first rank whom an impartial judge would 
unhesitatingly put into the first division. Maurice, 
Kingsley, Ruskin he certainly would. 
Indeed these four movements by themselves well-nigh 
cover the possible ground. The scientific movement has 
taught us that education is necessary to national efficiency 
in the economic sphere, the hygienic movement that it is 
necessary to individual well-being in the bodily sphere, 
and the other two movements that it is thus necessary in 
the spiritual sphere.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR 
HE prophets prophesied mainly during the “fifties” 
and “‘sixties,”’ but it took some time before the gradual 
leavening of national thought resulted in producing a state 
of mind capable of devising and supporting a State system 
of post-elementary education. In the technical sphere up 
to the passing of the Technical Instruction Act of 1889, 
in the secondary sphere up to the Bryce Commission (1894— 
1895), and in the university sphere up to the giving of 
government grants in 1889, we may call this the age of 
individual endeavour. 
As regards secondary education, this endeavour was 
naturally most successful at the upper end of the social 
scale, where there was least need of financial assistance 
from the State. Many of the schools which had been set 
on a sound financial basis as the result of the Commission 
began to do excellent work; they copied all the best points 
in the Arnoldian tradition, and sent their most promising 
pupils to the universities, where they held their own well 
with the products of the older schools. These schools were 
less expensive and appealed to the professional class; and 
they avoided more than the older schools the tradition of 
idleness and the new tendency to over-athleticism. But 
there were still lamentable gaps. Most of the reforms by 
which the educational value of the newer subjects have 
been brought out belong to a more recent date: witness 
the new geometry, the direct method of teaching languages, 
and reformed geography. The majority of the schools 
founded modern sides but relegated to them all their 
unpromising pupils. Classics continued therefore to be 
the great educative agent. The non-classical ‘‘middle” 
schools were deficient in numbers, lacked a clear-cut

educational programme, and, till the rise of newer uni- 
versities and places of professional and technical instruction, 
led nowhere. 
In describing the work of individual endeavour, it is 
easiest to take some one outstanding example; and, in this 
case, it would be generally agreed that the premier place 
belongs to Edward Thring of Uppingham, who gathers 
together the effects of all the movements described in the 
last chapter. He was the first notable example of a head- 
master who realised the effect of an artistic element in the 
school environment, who introduced manual training into 
the secondary school, and who used school missions to 
awake in the minds of his own class an understanding of 
the workers and sympathy for them. The introduction of 
the first school gymnasium likewise connects him with 
the hygienic movement. In the novelty of his ideas, the 
force of his personality, his influence over his contempo- 
raries and his reputation after his death, he is almost the 
equal of Arnold; but he does not possess the supreme 
importance of breaking up entirely fallow ground. 
Thring was educated at Eton and King’s College, Cam- 
bridge. Even in boyhood his experiences at Eton turned 
his attention to the evils of the public schools of those days 
before the Commission. The material conditions of ‘‘ Long 
Chamber” were so bad and the tone so low that, though 
Eton foundationers had the privilege of automatically 
proceeding as scholars to King’s, with a good chance of 
a fellowship to follow, Thring’s father like many others 
sent him at first as a paying pupil and entered him for a 
scholarship at the latest moment compatible with his 
holding it for the necessary three years. As a “‘colleger” 
he and many other boys could only work by getting up in 
the middle of the night when the other pupils were asleep. 
At King’s, as at New College, Oxford, there existed the 
curious privilege by which undergraduates obtained their 
degree without undergoing the University examinations. 
Thring was thus cut off from the hope of winning a first 
class; but he proved his scholarship by gaining the Porson 
Prize and subsequently, as a fellow, he took part in

abolishing the obnoxious regulation. Possibly to a mind 
so bubbling over with intellectual interests as Thring’s, 
the opportunity of working in his own way free from 
examinations was an advantage and may have had some- 
thing to do with his subsequent policy of laying stress on 
the literary and artistic sides of school work which do not 
help to win scholarships. After his ordination he was for 
a time curate at St James’s, Gloucester; and of all the 
branches of his clerical work that which interested him 
most was his teaching in the National school connected 
with the church. He regarded it as experimental work; 
he felt that education in all its grades was based on bad 
foundations, and the task which he set himself was to look 
for better. All his life he looked back to this time as his 
formative period: thus his views took shape before he ever 
began to teach in asecondary school and, though expanding 
in detail, were never substantially changed. He became 
profoundly convinced that, the younger the pupil, the 
more was teaching ability needed, that few teachers ever 
really got into the minds of their pupils, that they thought 
too exclusively of the subject-matter, and that they were 
committing a grave injustice in confining their interest to 
their clever pupils. He regarded a stupid boy as a most 
interesting problem, as a challenge to his skill as a teacher. 
When ill-health compelled him to abandon parochial work, 
he undertook private coaching as a form of light duty, and 
thus, like Arnold, passed directly to a headship without 
ever being an assistant. As in Arnold’s case, this private 
tuition opened his eyes to the need of dealing with indi- 
viduals as individuals and not losing them in the mass, 
which is a cardinal feature of his educational theory. In 
1853 he was appointed headmaster of Uppingham, at that 
time a small country grammar. school with two masters 
and twenty-five boys, and, in spite of much opposition from 
the governors, he raised it to a school of thirty masters 
and 320 boys, beyond which limit he refused to allow it 
to increase. 
It will be best to consider the leading features in his 
character before we pass on to his work, The first was his

thoroughness. “An archbishop was asked ‘What kind of 
a man is Edward Thring?’ The archbishop was about to 
poke the fire. ‘Why, he was this kind of a man; if he were 
poking a fire, he would make you believe that the one 
thing worth living for was to know how to poke a fire 
properly.” Another man said, “TI do not believe he would 
have omitted one portion of the day’s routine, if that 
omission had injured a single boy, for the position of the 
highest eminence his country could bestow?.” The effective- 
ness of this quality is obvious; but it had one disadvantage 
—it made his writings seem somewhat exaggerated: his 
condemnations of politicians, officials, his governors, and 
others who did not agree with him, at first sight suggest 
a man who could see no good in anything which was not 
in accordance with his own ideas. Yet no man was less 
conceited. 
The second striking characteristic of Thring was his 
sympathy. This quality was combined with an absolute 
masterfulness. Arnold was sympathetic with very small 
boys and, at the other end of the scale, he won the friend 
ship of his Sixth Form, but his sternness was somewhat 
awe-inspiring to boys in the middle of the school. But it 
must be remembered that Arnold had to reform a school 
where bad traditions had taken root, whereas Thring 
could build up what was practically a new school on his 
own lines and, beginning with a few boys, was able to get 
into such touch with them at the beginning that he never 
lost it. Nevertheless, in spite of Arnold’s remark that he 
should resign as soon as he could no longer run up the 
library stairs, one has a feeling that Thring had something 
of the boy in him which Arnold never had; and his im- 
pulsiveness, his tendency to rush from gloom to the full 
enjoyment of a holiday, and his unwillingness to brook 
opposition are all characteristics of a bubbling, boyish 
nature which made him understand boys. Unlike Arnold, 
he had too a strong sense of humour. He was ready to do 
anyone a good turn either by help, time, or money. He

kept in constant touch with his old boys. In his diary 
little school incidents seem to occupy his attention as much 
as big questions of administration: he was always thinking 
of individuals. Gratitude or confidence shown by pupils 
touched him deeply and misconduct made him miserable. 
Thirdly, we have already spoken of his masterfulness. 
Up to a point all great headmasters are masterful, at least 
in their dealings with their pupils; but it was not mainly 
with his pupils that Thring showed this quality. Though 
he made it clear that he took a serious view of misbehaviour 
in class, this was a natural outcome of his securing smaller 
classes, better masters, and more congenial surroundings. 
He considered that he had done away with the causes 
which naturally led to idleness and inattention and that 
he could justly claim a higher standard of order. He secured 
his higher standard, but he was no martinet. “A master 
came to him and said, ‘A must be caned; he has been very 
insolent.’ Thring agreed and A was caned. A week later 
the master came and said, ‘A must be crushed; he has 
repeated his insolent conduct.’ Thring turned and said, 
‘A shan’t be crushed; he is a very good boy, but just at 
present he is standing at bay like a rat in a corner. Punish 
him slightly for this, for the next month shut your eyes 
resolutely to everything you are not obliged to see.’ The 
plan answered'.” Though we find from Thring’s diary 
that he was strict with his staff on such points as being 
late for school and going off to read the newspaper, and 
though at first there was some little inclination among 
them to regard him as faddy on matters which seemed to 
them to be trifles, yet he had their solid support in all 
his great struggles with the governing body. He insisted 
firmly on his absolute right to dismiss his assistants, but 
he was too kind to use it on the rare occasions when he 
had a master who was not up to his usual standard. In 
fact his masterfulness was not displayed against those who 
were under him but against those who claimed to be over 
him. He held an autocratic theory as to the independence 
of a headmaster and showed an almost rebellious spirit 
1 Op. cit. p. 143.
-P-A-G-E-223
vit] WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR 209 
to any power, whether the State or the governors of the 
school, who claimed to limit that independence. His 
fighting instincts were aroused by opposition. When he 
engaged new masters, he made it clear that, even though 
they were sinking money in the school by the conditions 
on which they took boarding houses, his right to dismiss 
them was real, that he was no constitutional ruler, much 
less the instrument of a committee, that even when he 
asked for advice he was not bound to act on it, and that 
the masters’ meetings were merely advisory. The least 
sign of opposition on the part of the governors is met by 
an outburst of wrath in his diary; and against the Com- 
missioners appointed under the Endowed Schools Act he 
declared open war. He has nothing too bad to say of 
government interference in education or about any attempt 
to impose inspection on secondary schools. 
Lastly we may notice his religious earnestness. His 
diary reveals an almost Cromwellian belief that every 
detail of life is specially determined by Providence for 
some end. It was the humility and constant searching of 
heart which this belief inspired which prevented his master- 
fulness from becoming of such a kind as to over-ride the 
legitimate claims of others. His religion was very practical: 
it led him to found the first school mission in a slum and 
to take an active part in working the local “Mutual 
Improvement Society,” to which he gave a less formally 
religious turn than that which hitherto prevailed in such 
organisations. Nowadays, perhaps, religious bodies are 
inclined to run. to death the idea of reaching the people 
by means of amusements; but the danger then was in the 
opposite direction. This society therefore, with its con- 
certs, classes, lectures, and tennis and cricket clubs, was 
a move in the right direction, an attempt to educate 
informally. His scripture teaching left a deeper impression 
than any part of his work, though it would have surprised 
any examiner. He used the supposed matter of the syllabus 
merely as a peg on which to hang his own ideas, which 
were always marked by freshness and individuality; he 
would sometimes devote a whole month to a single chapter.   A.S.E. 14

  210 WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR [cu. 
We pass now to his leading ideas, which, as has already 
been stated, were formed before he went to Uppingham. 
He lays it down as the main point of difference be- 
tween his own practice and that of the old public schools 
that a school, to be honest, must educate every single 
pupil and not concentrate its main endeavours entirely 
on the ablest. Even at Rugby, which had since Arnold’s 
death come to be popularly regarded as a model—a 
view which Thring somewhat resents—he declares that 
there were three forms which averaged over sixty boys and 
that in the headmaster’s house there were between sixty 
and seventy. (In justice to Arnold it should be said that 
the restriction which he had set on the total number of the 
school had been removed since his death.) He attacks, as 
“the greatest heresy against educational truth ever ex- 
pressed,” the belief that ‘“‘the first, second, and third duty 
of a schoolmaster is to get rid of unpromising subjectst.”” 
If he is attacking Arnold, the charge is hardly fair; for 
Arnold only removed boys whose moral influence he 
believed to be bad: but he has more show of reason if 
he is attacking the system of ‘‘superannuation”’ recom- 
mended by the Public Schools Commission and since pretty 
generally adopted in the public schools, by which any boy 
who fails to gain his promotion to a particular form by 
a given age is automatically removed. No stigma attaches 
to such removal; the plan is due as much to the tremendous 
competition for places in these schools as to the acceptance 
of Arnold’s theory that intellectual dullards are more often 
than other boys a bad moral influence. Thring’s champion- 
ship of the claims of the average boy is eminently reasonable, 
though he seems to have pushed it too far in claiming the 
right of the stupid boy to remain at school after sixteen. 
Surely the true principle is that, so long as the boy is at 
school, he has a right to his fair share of attention, but 
that there must be an age at which it is not worth while 
wasting the energy of teachers in continuing the education 
of less able pupils. It is merely an application of the law 
of diminishing returns. Thring’s sincerity on this point

  vit] WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR arr 
was so well-known that he felt it a cause of grievance that 
certain parents sent their less able children to Uppingham 
and the clever member of the family elsewhere! 
Though his personality was doubtless the largest factor 
in his success, he himself attributed it largely to organisa- 
tion. He was always emphasising the need of adjusting 
every detail in the school to the fulfilment of its aims, 
with this object in view he began with the buildings. 
“The almighty wall is, after all, the supreme and final 
arbiter of schools'.’’ We are used to this doctrine now; it 
was revolutionary in the days of ill-lighted, ill-ventilated 
class-rooms, their heavy oak desks carved with the names 
of countless generations, without a picture on the walls, 
ink everywhere, and everything of such a colour that the 
day’s dirt made no difference. ‘‘ Never rest till you have 
got all the fixed machinery for the work the best possible. 
The waste in a teacher’s workshop is the lives of men.” 
“There is a large percentage of temptation, criminality, 
and idleness in the great schools to be got rid of even by 
mere mechanical improvements. Bullying is fostered by 
harshness in the masters and by forcing boys to herd 
together in promiscuous masses. Lying is fostered by 
general class rules which take no cognisance of the ability 
of the individual to keep them. Idleness is fostered when 
there are so many boys to each master that it becomes a 
chance when it will be detected. Rebellion is fostered when 
many boys who are backward or want ability find no 
care bestowed on them. Sensuality is fostered when such 
boys are launched into an ungoverned society without any 
healthy instinct.” 
His general principles thus glide into the careful working 
out of minutiae. To begin with, he limited the number of 
boys to 320, and in his later years had one big fight with 
his governors on this point. ‘As long as a headmaster 
knows every boy,” he used to-say, ‘“‘he is headmaster”; 
otherwise, if a boy whom he does not know is reported to 
him by one of his staff, he must take the master’s opinion 
and the latter ‘“‘is so far headmaster” and the head “sinks

into the position of his policeman?.’”’ He likewise limited 
the size of houses to thirty and of forms to about twenty- 
five boys. 
Though he loved architecture, he denounced the building 
of stately piles which were intended for architectural effect 
rather than to serve their purpose of training boys. As 
soon as he was able to collect the money, he built a hall 
to hold the whole school (1863) and a chapel (1865), in 
order to provide for their life as a community. As we have 
already said, he was the first headmaster of a large school 
to see the bad results of the old bare untidy class-room, of 
which the worst existing elementary school which survives 
in some isolated parish gives us but a faint idea. ‘“‘ Another 
grave cause of evil,” he writes, “is the dishonour shown to 
the place in which work is done. Mean treatment produces 
mean ideas. Honour the work and it will honour you?.” 
So he instituted well-lighted comfortable class-rooms with 
autotypes on the walls, installed new desks which he would 
not allow the boys to cut, and insisted on tidiness. 
“Every boy can do something well”: this was the prin- 
ciple on which he dealt with the problem of the “stupid 
boy.’”’ He confined the ordinary school subjects—classics, 
mathematics, English composition (on which he laid great 
stress), English grammar, scripture, history and geography 
—to the morning: in the afternoon came music and the 
various optional subjects, of which every boy had to take 
one or two, viz. French, German, chemistry, drawing, 
carpentery, and turning. The gymnasium, which was 
opened in 1859, was the first in any English school. So 
were the workshops, laboratories, school garden, and 
aviary. Though not particularly musical himself, he 
attached great importance to music, wrote the words of 
school songs, engaged good musicians as teachers, and 
instituted school concerts. Before his time a school choir 
for the chapel services and a little music on speech-day were 
all that any school ever attempted, and most public school- 
boys would have been as surprised to be offered instru- 
mental music, which a large percentage of Uppingham boys

learned, as their successors would be if they were expected 
to learn sewing. Sport was of course already well established 
in schools and Thring often turned out to play football with 
his boys; but he may be considered as the originator of the 
other activities which no less than the class-room form part 
of the educational machinery of the modern school. 
As regards curriculum, though he was thus a pioneer in 
the work of introducing the aesthetic and hobby subjects 
into schools, he was opposed to the superficiality which 
he believed would come from an overloaded curriculum. 
He was a firm believer in classics. His point of view was 
not exactly that of the old-fashioned “‘scholarship” nor 
yet Arnold’s, in which the emphasis was laid on the thought 
of the authors. His old pupil Nettleship writes to him, 
“The way in which you taught what they call ‘scholar- 
ship’ tended distinctly to make one think of the form of 
ancient and modern artistic expression rather than of 
language as a subject of philological or even (primarily) 
grammatical interest!.”” Thring replies, “ Philology I look 
on as a scientific toy totally unfitted for school training. 
I have always striven to make our literary training here 
a great artistic lesson in the sense you speak of art; to make 
it a living thing, to join together the ages, and show how 
thought in heathen times worshipped form and beautiful 
shape, and how thought in Christian times worships ex- 
pression and beautiful life, and to weave together the 
principles of skilful power at work so as to show the proper 
proportions, the true sources, the right use, and enable a 
right judgment to judge correctly of each®.”’ Similarly in 
English, he regarded all teaching of the history of the 
language, which was just beginning to find advocates, as 
pure cram, but, like Matthew Arnold, he retained the old 
disciplinary idea that English grammar, treated induc- 
tively, furnished the best basis for language teaching, and 
he wrote several grammars intended for younger pupils. 
English composition was to his mind as important as 
classics. He does not seem to have taught English litera- 
ture, doubtless believing that to insist on reading it in the

class-room was the surest way to prevent it from being 
read anywhere else. Latin verses still found in him a 
defender!. Like the Public School Commissioners he was 
opposed to modern sides, believing in the German system 
of establishing separate Realschulen. 
He was one of the first secondary school teachers in 
England to become conscious of method as such. He was 
interested in the training of elementary school teachers, 
but we are not aware of any evidence that he definitely 
contemplated the establishment of a system of training 
their secondary colleagues. He wanted everyone to think 
out his own methods. “In teaching, the structure of the 
work is everything, and the power of turning out the 
perfect result nothing. If for one year all rules and lesson 
books could be swept clean out of the world and the per- 
formers be brought face to face with mind, the little boy 
mind, and be compelled to trade on their own resources 
and forced to meet the real problem of mind dealing with 
mind, there would be much tearing of hair, but a new 
creation would have begun®.’”’ The first sentence of this 
quotation possibly shows his attitude towards the pro- 
fessional training of teachers. As conducted in elementary 
training colleges in Thring’s time it was naturally affected 
by the unfortunate necessity imposed on teachers by the 
Lowe Code of aiming at “results.” Secondary training, 
he may have thought, would have followed the same lines. 
Possibly too he may have feared lest it would cause the 
teacher to lose his originality and not to think for himself. 
The same fundamental views may lead two men at different 
periods to directly opposite policies on what seems to be 
the same issue. Training now aims less at inculcating cut- 
and-dried rules than at encouraging the student to think 
out things for himself. 
It was a somewhat novel thing for a headmaster to write 
books on his educational views. Thring, however, felt that 
he had a message and he delivered it in his Education and 
School (1864) and Theory and Practice of Teaching (1883). 
In these publications he shows himself not so much as

was a keen supporter of the movement for the better 
education of girls and women, and invited a conference 
of headmistresses to Uppingham. He strove to promote 
adult education among the townsfolk and inaugurated 
various classes for discussion and the teaching of cookery 
and handwork. He was the first headmaster who con- 
ceived the idea of using a public school as a means of 
interesting the wealthier classes in the social conditions of 
their poorer brothers: his mission in North Woolwich and 
subsequently in Poplar was the forerunner of numerous 
university and public school settlements. Herein we see 
the effect of the social movement started by Maurice and 
Kingsley. 
An account of Thring’s work would be incomplete with- 
out a reference to one of the best-known incidents in his 
headmastership, the outbreak of diphtheria and removal 
of the school for a time to an hotel at Borth on the Cardigan- 
shire coast. The incident illustrates Thring’s invariable 
promptitude, energy and resource. 
There died in 1919 an Uppingham master who followed 
in Thring’s footsteps and proved that the twentieth 
century can still produce men in the old heroic mould. 
This was G. W. S. Howson, who was appointed in rg00 to 
be headmaster of Gresham’s School, Holt, by the Fish- 
monger’s Company, the endowments of the school having 
suddenly increased. Like Thring he started with such 
small numbers that he was able to follow his own lines. 
He carried the system of trusting boys’ honour successfully 
beyond the point at which Arnold and Thring had left it. 
He had no written rules, and an absolute minimum of 
punishments. He did not lock the doors at “lock-up”; he 
proceeded on the assumption that boys were the same 
beings at a boarding-school as at home and would respond 
 
-P-A-G-E-230

to the same treatment. On one matter only did he break 
away from Thring; he abolished Greek. But he gained 
many scholarships in non-classical subjects. His school 
was thoroughly conducted ‘‘on public school lines”; he 
limited its numbers, however, like Arnold, to 250, and on 
the same grounds; “he trusted to surroundings as much as 
Thring; and he kept out the modern over-athleticism. 
He dealt a final blow to the ‘natural enmity” theory 
between teacher and taught. 
We have reserved to the end the story of Thring’s war 
against government control. It began with the Schools 
Inquiry Commission, before which he gave evidence. He 
was received in a thoroughly friendly spirit, but the report 
contained no reference to his views, and he soon showed 
his disapproval of its tenour. He described it as ‘‘a great 
indirect glorification of the old and new shams.” “T feel 
quite certain that the question ‘What constitutes a good 
school?’ must be raised.”’ “The Commissioners have not 
raised the question at all but tacitly assumed”’ that the 
seven public schools ‘‘are models” and that “a happy 
combination of ability and fortune may possibly raise some 
others to this level.” ‘What great school, even in theory, 
has faced the problem of teaching and training each boy 
in the best way?” “I desire to separate my lot entirely 
from the fashionable schools and to cast it in, come weal 
come woe, with the smaller schools.” 
When the Act was passed and the Commissioners who 
were appointed under it drew up their scheme for Upping- 
ham he resolutely fought it on the following grounds. 
(x) The masters who had practically been the financial 
reconstructors of the school were only to be represented 
on the governing body by two members. (2) The functions 
of governors should in his opinion be strictly limited, where- 
as “there are sundry things in the scheme which practically 
give absolute control of the construction of the school to 
the governing body, and that deadest of all dead hands, 
the hand of living external force, can at any moment 
be applied to the heartstrings of the work and the workers 
1 Vol. 1, p. 169. 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  vit] WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR 217 
here!.”” (3) He feared the loss of the Church character of 
the school. He was a stout believer in denominational 
teaching, holding that under an undenominational system 
“religion must be treated as a by-subject of intellectual 
knowledge”; ‘‘but religion is education®.” On all three 
points the Commissioners gave way. It is natural to 
sympathise with a man like Thring who was really origina- 
tive and felt that an educational experiment was at the 
mercy of committees who can never originate. It must 
not be forgotten, however, that the policy of a body like 
the Commissioners has to be based on the Kantian principle 
so to act that the principle of your action may be able to 
serve as a universal law. It would be impossible and, if 
possible, undesirable for all local grammar schools to be 
turned into big first-grade schools. It would be equally 
harmful for all the headmasters of grammar schools to 
waste their energies in a useless competition to be the 
few who succeeded, as all would have neglected their own 
proper work, whether they succeeded or not, in doing that 
for which they sought to exchange it. Thring’s case was 
in its nature an exception to a general rule: the Com- 
missioners wisely treated him as an exception, as pioneers 
and men of genius necessarily are; but Thring had no right 
to claim that exceptions should determine general rules. 
History necessarily selects big men to illustrate their time; 
in so doing it often sees things through the eyes of big men 
and from their standpoint; and it sometimes forgets that 
there is any other standpoint. In this particular case of 
Thring’s'struggle to make Uppingham into a “new model,” 
it is easy to forget, for instance, that there was an Oakham 
standpoint. Oakham was a sister grammar school on the 
same foundation, founded for the same purpose as a local 
grammar school for Rutland, and till Thring’s time it was 
the more successful school of the two. Yet Thring proposed 
to convert it into a preparatory school for Uppingham! 
In order to secure a permanent machinery for resisting 
encroachments, as he considered them, by the State, Thring 
took the lead in turning a special meeting of headmasters, 
a Violet, sper 872 2 Vol. 11, pp 222-3.

convened to consider the Bill of 1869, into an annual 
Headmasters’ Conference. At first the old public schools 
held aloof, but they soon came in. After fifty years we can 
only look on the Conference with mixed feelings. It was 
almost the earliest of scholastic associations. The National 
Union of Teachers was founded in 1870, the Headmistresses’ 
Association in 1874, the Private Schools Association in 
1883, the Assistant Mistresses’ Association in 1884, the 
Teachers’ Guild in 1885, the Headmasters’ Association in 
1890, the Assistant Masters’ Association, the Headmasters 
of Private Schools’ Association, and the Headmasters of 
Higher Grade and Organised Science Schools Association 
in 1892. Sectional societies were necessary before any 
solidarity could be gained in the scholastic profession: 
sectional they had to be if their deliberations were to deal 
with the practical problems which their members had to 
handle every day; and in 1870 anything but sectional 
bodies was impossible. At any rate the Conference has 
done something to put an end to the separation of the old 
public schools from a hundred smaller schools doing the 
same work. But it has proved an ultra-conservative body. 
Its first work was to anticipate the danger of a State 
examination by inducing the old Universities to set up 
an examining body of their own for first-grade schools— 
the Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board. Probably this 
was a good piece of work. Most examinations have led 
to cram, but the Joint Board least of all. It is hard to 
pronounce a verdict on an examination which never existed 
outside the minds of a Royal Commission; but we do not 
believe a State examination would have been so good. 
State examination in the case of elementary schools was 
as bad as it could possibly be. On the other hand a State 
examination would have not only performed the work of 
the Joint Board, but it would have absorbed a hundred 
other examining bodies whose multiplicity was forty years 
later revealed to be working havoc with school timetables. 
But, after it had done this, it is difficult to point to any- 
thing else which the Conference has ever done. Probably 
Thring was right in insisting that its discussions should 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
oe ee vit] WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR = 219g 
be merely designed for the interchange of views and that 
it should make no claim to pass binding resolutions. But 
it is hard to imagine anything which would so bind the 
members of the Conference to adhere to set paths as 
Thring’s action in preventing the very discussion of making 
Greek optional by threatening to resign his seat. From 
that time onwards the Conference has tended to become 
a trade guild for preserving traditional customs and to 
miss its chance of becoming an educational cabinet which 
should convert ideas into working realities. There is not 
much use in an educational House of Lords which accepts 
new ideas only after everyone else has accepted them, even 
if its members are wiser than some persons outside it in 
seeing the value of old ideas. People who are all agreed 
need not come together to tell one another that the world 
needs literature as well as science, and character as well as 
instruction: they would be better employed in preaching 
these truths to those who have forgotten them or never 
knew them. 
Thring’s opinion that government action in education 
was essentially evil may need modifying into a statement 
that government action about 1880 was accidentally but 
invariably evil, and we can then dissent from his premises 
while we recognise the value of the action which he based on 
them. The foremost belief which he regarded as rooted in 
the mind of government officials as such was an unlimited 
faith in examinations. ‘‘ Where examinations reign, every 
novelty in training, every original advance, every new way 
of dealing with the mind, becomes at once impossible. It 
is outside the prescribed area and does not pay.” “Do our 
universities, the government, and the parents want 
memory or mind? Do they want knowledge or strength?” 
“The inspector destroys teaching because he is bound by 
law and necessity to examine according to a given pattern, 
and the perfection of teaching is that it does not work by 
a given pattern.” He feared too that, by insisting on 
additional subjects, the government would produce super- 
ficiality. “The government during the last twenty years 
1 Vol. II, p. 131. 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
    
220 WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR §[cu. 
has practically been legislating against the schools, de- 
manding everywhere either fresh subjects or a different 
kind of them or both, thus calling into existence an army 
of crammers and pulling down the schools in the direction 
of more branches of superficial knowledge.’ In 1885 he 
writes: “The professional body are beginning to chafe 
under this terrible slavery. The present exponents of 
education in London won’t do. As far as I know them, 
they are the strangest mixture of red tape, crude dis- 
satisfaction, narrow sciolism, revolutionary fumes, un- 
workable old and unworkable new, kneaded up into an 
infallible pudding, that can be imagined®.”” The important 
thing to note is that this kind of talk, which assumed that 
the Education Department was incurable, has cured it. 
State education under Robert Lowe would have been a 
curse; under Mr Fisher it may be a blessing. Long after 
Lowe’s time the central authorities treated teachers as 
the army before the Boer War treated recruits—“ their’s 
not to reason why.” 
The result was that a progressive educationalist like 
Thring was led, on the political side of education, to a high 
Toryism which would strike the present generation with 
amazement. He denounced free elementary education as 
theft, and the arguments which he uses against it would 
logically apply to all State subsidy of schools. (1) You 
place judgment on educational questions in the hands of 
the general community, 7.e. the ignorant. (2) You place 
the teachers who are skilled workmen under officials who 
are amateurs. (3) You decide all questions on authority 
and so prevent experiment and improvement. (4) You 
prevent individuals from starting new types of school. 
(5) When parents pay or subscribers subscribe, they are 
interested in the education which they maintain ; when they 
are taxed, they wash their hands of the whole matter. 
(6) State education must be undenominational, and he did 
not believe that undenominational education could be really 
religious. The weakness in Thring’s conclusion does not 
arise from any fault in his arguments—there is much truth 
1 p. 199. op oir,
-P-A-G-E-235
  vit] WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR 221 
in many of them—so much as from his failure to see the 
considerations on the other side. The essential fact was that 
there was a huge gap which private endeavour in the years 
between 1868, when the gap was made clearly evident by 
the Schools Inquiry Commission, and 1894, when the Bryce 
Commission was appointed, entirely failed to fill. It was 
the work of the prophets to arouse the country to a sense 
of the meaning and value of education; it was the work of 
progressive schoolmasters like Thring to set examples of 
it in concrete form; but either it was the work of the State 
to diffuse it on a large scale, or else such diffusion must be 
pronounced to be impossible. 
We have had numerous occasions to refer to the in- 
creasing hold. which examinations were gaining upon 
schools, and it is time to treat their history a little more 
fully. Perhaps the belief in their efficacy originally dates 
from the part which they were supposed to have played in 
the recuperation of the old universities. It was rife every- 
where by 1850. England succeeded in imposing the incubus 
not only on itself but even over other countries with which 
it came into contact. Examinations have been the bane 
of Indian education. They were undoubtedly encouraged 
at home because of their use for competitive as well as 
testing purposes. Some substitute for appointment by 
influence was needed in government departments; and 
examination afforded an obvious method of ensuring fair- 
ness though it does not necessarily secure efficiency. They 
were first adopted for the Indian Civil Service in 1854; the 
higher positions in the Home Service followed almost 
immediately; within twenty years the system had spread 
to all branches of the civil service, to entrance into Wool- 
wich and Sandhurst, and to commissions on passing out 
of those institutions. We have already seen how Oriel 
opened its fellowships to competitive examination, how 
the Universities Commissions extended competition to all 
scholarships, how the Public Schools Commission insisted 
on competition for scholarships in the large secondary 
schools, and how Robert Lowe in 1860 introduced the 
system into elementary schools. Its defects were ignored.  
-P-A-G-E-236
  222 WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR [cu. 
As a means of entrance into the State service, it was 
forgotten that examination at its best tests only certain 
kinds of ability, and that a good examinee may from the 
lack of other qualities prove a very poor civil servant. At 
its worst it only tests memory or even luck in choosing an 
expert ‘‘crammer’”’ who can “spot the questions” likely 
to be set. Our scholarship system is excellent in intention, 
since it is an attempt to open our educational institutions 
to poorer candidates of ability; and its application in 
the universities was successful in encouraging industry 
and did something towards admitting poorer pupils. Its 
adoption in the public schools was a more doubtful blessing, 
since its direct effect was to encourage premature special- 
isation in expensive preparatory schools. 
But it is of examinations for testing purposes that we 
here wish particularly to speak. Five main examinations 
have been invented for testing the work of pupils at 
schools. 
(1) The College of Preceptors, founded in 1846, began 
its work of examining in 1853. Its examinations were of 
three grades, and it provided mainly for the lower branches 
of secondary education. It did a useful work in its early 
days in the way of widening curricula and giving something 
for private schools to aim at; but later on its examinations 
were used as an easy mode of advertisement, and young 
pupils were greatly harmed by being kept constantly in 
an examination atmosphere. This danger has in recent 
times been mitigated by the refusal of the Board of Educa- 
tion to allow pupils in grant-earning schools to be sent 
in for external examinations below the age of fifteen; but 
it lasted throughout the period of which we are now 
speaking. 
(2) The Local Examinations (1858) of Oxford and Cam- 
bridge were of a higher standard and intended for second- 
grade schools. The authorities proceeded to add a junior 
and a preliminary examination which fostered the same 
evils as the examinations of the College of Preceptors; 
but their senior examination has on the whole stimulated 
and guided. : 
   
-P-A-G-E-237
  
vit] WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR — 223 
(3) The Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board Examina- 
tion, of which we described the origin in the account of 
Thring, is intended for first-grade schools. Girls were 
admitted in 1878, and a junior examination was added in 
1882. On the principle that less harm is done by examina- 
tions to older than to younger pupils, the ‘“ Joint Board”’ 
has been the most innocuous examination of all. 
(4) The London Matriculation Examination was not 
intended as a school testing examination but came to be 
used for this purpose. To avoid the evils incident to applying 
to one use an examination intended for another, London 
and other modern universities have in recent times in- 
stituted school-leaving examinations. 
(5) The South Kensington examinations in science and 
art (1861) were intended to test evening and other classes 
rather than full-time schools. Some of them (1859-1867) 
were also intended as qualifications for teachers of science 
and art—a poor substitute for a proper course of training. 
This particular incursion of government into examination 
was due to the fact that, at the time these examinations 
were instituted, science and art were supposed to lie quite 
outside the scope of secondary education. They had the 
further peculiarity that they were a part of the grant- 
earning machinery, like the later examinations of Robert 
Lowe’s Code. When science classes developed into schools 
of science (1872), these examinations became a part of the 
regular examination machinery of schools which would now 
be considered as secondary, and completely dominated 
them, with very uneducational results, tillthe reconstitution 
of these schools as Schedule A Schools at the beginning of 
the new century (1902). South Kensington was a branch of 
the Board of Trade from its full constitution in 1853 to 1856; 
but it had already become attached to the Education 
Department when it started its examining work; however, 
it retained substantial independence till the passing of the 
Board of Education Act, 1899. It is difficulty tosay whether 
more good was done by securing that science was taught at 
all or harm by encouraging bad methods of teaching it. 
But these five by no means exhaust the list of examina- 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
    224 WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR {[cu. 
tions taken by school pupils. The number was ever in- 
creasing. At the end of the period there were examinations 
in technical subjects such as those of the City and Guilds 
Institute and the London Chamber of Commerce, and 
examinations conducted by various professional bodies for 
admission to their respective professions, such as those of 
the Law Society, the General Medical Council, the Chartered 
Accountants, Actuaries, Architects, Civil Engineers, and 
Pharmaceutical Society. Though in time these bodies came 
to recognise other examinations, they still retained their 
own. Indeed the Consultative Committee of the Board of 
Education discovered in the early years of the present 
century that there were more than a hundred examinations 
for which school pupils were being entered; and the Board 
has set itself to reduce their number, to co-ordinate those 
which remain and determine their equivalence, to abolish 
examinations at the junior stages and to approximate to 
the Prussian system of two examinations, one intended for 
pupils aged about sixteen and the other for pupils aged 
about nineteen. An examination at the end of a pupil’s 
career is inevitable; but it does not involve either a sub- 
ordination of the whole school teaching to what will “pay” 
in examinations or the incessant taking of the machinery 
to pieces to see how it is working. By the end of the century 
it had actually come to pass that a pupil was frequently 
sent in for the same examination several times from pure 
motives of advertisement; and schoolboys and schoolgirls 
came to be so used to working for an examination every 
year that they lost the power of working without such a 
stimulus. University scholarship examinations, which test 
promise rather than performance, have, however, rather 
mitigated than augmented the evil. 
The years from 1868 to the end of the century witnessed 
a growing encouragement of school activities outside the 
class-room. The old public schools gave us games, the 
school magazine, and debating societies, at an earlier date; 
and these have of course become well-nigh universal. 
During this period games came to be so emphasised at the 
old type of school as to arouse considerable misgiving.
-P-A-G-E-239
  vit] WORK OF INDIVIDUAL ENDEAVOUR = 225 
A games master became a regular institution, and athletic 
ability came to count too much in the appointment of his 
colleagues. The love of playing—but, alas! too often only 
of watching—games spread to the whole nation. It was 
during these years that football, both Rugby and Associa- 
tion, came to be played at the universities, where rowing 
and cricket were already well-established, that both forms 
of the game became an adult as well as a boys’ amusement 
throughout the country, that League football almost sur- 
passed the turf as a national institution, and that Australian 
cricket teams began to visit the mother country. Cricket 
had already produced its greatest exponent in W. G. Grace 
before football gained its popularity. The exaggerated stress 
which is laid on sport in boarding schools must not blind 
us to the good effects of its spread in day schools, where 
it would appear that its physical and moral advantages 
can be secured without its monopolising attention. At 
many day schools games are now compulsory, and, from 
a wide point of view as to the nature of education, the 
arguments for this course would appear irresistible. Since 
Thring’s time all large schools have built gymnasia; but 
gymnastics have not become so popular as gameshave. Her- 
bert Spencer, the apostle of physical education, regarded 
them as an artificial substitute; and his testimony is that of 
a cold-blooded scientist, not that of an athletic enthusiast. 
Popular opinion regarded them as a foreign importation. 
Educational theorists called to mind the saying of Plato, 
the founder of educational theory, that those are wrong 
who hold that “gymnastic,” 7.e. physical training, is for 
the body and “music,” 7.e. intellectual training, for the 
soul, but rather both are for the soul. They argued that 
the modern gymnasium, however much it might develop 
the muscles, fell far short of games in its influence on 
character. Finally, modern hygiene showed that muscular 
development and health are by no means identical, and 
that enjoyment is a great factor in giving bodily exercise 
its health-giving value. Nowadays systems of physical 
drill which take account of the internal organs as well 
as of the muscles are tending to supersede the parallel 
A.S.E. 15

and horizontal bars and the other appliances of the 
gymnasium. 
Plays, concerts, and natural history societies are of later 
growth. Latin plays were a regular school institution in 
the days which followed the Renaissance, but the West- 
minster play was the only survival. The Bradfield Greek 
play, acted in a disused chalkpit and reproducing the 
original methods of staging, is the most famous of modern 
developments in this field. The decline of the Puritan 
hostility to stage plays has been followed by their recogni- 
tion as a legitimate form of art, to which equally with 
other forms a school education should introduce its pupils. 
The recognition of play-writing and play-acting as a 
training in self-expression, especially for the younger 
pupils, is a more recent development. Musical teaching in 
boys’ schools developed out of the chapel services which 
in large boarding schools, partly through Arnold’s in- 
fluence, quite superseded attendance at the parsih church; 
but music is now established in its own right. Natural 
history societies are of course an offshoot of the scientific 
movements and are probably a more effective way of 
reviving the interest of boys in the animal and plant world, 
which the predominance of games had tended to displace, 
than any formal lessons in ‘‘nature study.” In the old days 
boys’ natural instincts had tended to satisfy themselves in 
poaching, birds’-nesting, and other undesirable exhibitions 
of the Englishman’s motto: “It’s a fine day; let’s go out and 
killsomething”’ ; and headmasters had naturally discouraged 
such activities. During the last thirty years photography, 
boys’ magazines, and the modern scientific trend have 
provided better outlets for the open air instincts. 
Finally, there can be no doubt that the relations between 
boys and masters had improved before the bulk of the new 
schools revived and has been improving ever since. Part- 
nership in games and in hobbies has been of great assistance, 
but the main cause has been the changed attitude of the 
teacher towards his work. Improved methods of teaching 
will probably complete the change; for, so long as boys 
hated their work, there was always a clash of motive.
-P-A-G-E-241

They might respect the man, but they were bound to chafe 
against the taskmaster. This is one reason why discipline 
has proved easier in girls’ schools. 
These changed relations are well brought out in the 
biographies of Edward Bowen, who became an assistant 
master at Harrow in the sixties, and Almond, headmaster 
of Loretto (1862). 
Bowen’s criticism of Arnold shows the points in which 
the opinion of teachers was changing. He objects to the 
over-serious, over-dignified master, who will not venture 
a joke in the class-room; to the stiff attitude of boys in 
class which was regarded as essential to good discipline; 
to the excessive use of emulation; to a half unconscious 
belief that work which is to be beneficial cannot be enjoy- 
able ; and to a suspicion that a teacher with outside interests 
cannot be devoting himself whole-heartedly to his school 
work!. Bowen was one of the first masters in a classical 
school to value the importance of making the work in- 
teresting. Without interest he held it to be impossible to 
secure the true aim of scholarship, which was to get to 
know the mind of the ancients, that is from their mode of 
expression to reach their mode of thought, and from that 
“to get a kind of intellectual parallax in contemplating 
the problems of life.’ He took a vigorous part in the 
campaign for finally exterminating memorised syntax, he 
was prepared to legitimise the use of ‘“‘cribs,”’ and he was 
so ultra-modern as to oppose compulsory Greek. There 
was, he held, ‘‘a point beyond which the claims of scholar- 
ship are not paramount,” and that point was passed when 
work was an unwelcome burden. In 1869 he became 
master of the newly-formed modern side, and fought hard 
for keeping its intellectual level as high as that of the 
classical side. But it is not in his fine teaching power and 
his gift of moral inspiration that he is so strikingly modern 
as in the way in which, as a house-master, he set the ex- 
ample of sharing the life of the boys, by writing school 
songs, by playing football up to the age of sixty-five, and 
by personal interest in each individual boy.

This changed relation to the boys is the leading feature 
too in the work of Almond. Almond may be thought to 
have pressed the claims of athletics too far and to have 
rated the claims of scholarship too low. His career was 
one long reaction against contemporary Scottish philis- 
| tinism. ‘All work and no play” as a means of getting on 
in business, with a consequent atrophy of the finer sides 
of human nature, seemed to him to be the ideal of the 
Scottish middle-classes. In this spirit he had been brought | 
up till, at Oxford, the river revived the dormant impulses 
in his nature. He became a fanatical adherent of the 
mens sana in corpore sano. ‘‘The laws of physical well- 
being are the laws of God!.”’ The luxury of the rich and 
the rushing of the poor into towns were undermining the 
physique of the nation. Only games could save it. But, 
what was even more, games were the best corrective of 
a conventional morality which had its true roots in selfish- 
ness; they would restore spontaneity, forgetfulness of self, 
and the pristine joy of living. They would counteract the 
craving for luxury by revealing that true happiness comes 
from the unfettered activity of our own nature and not 
from external possessions. He justified the subordination 
of scholarship by the order in which he placed the aims 
of education—‘‘character, physique, intelligence, man- 
ners,” and last of all ‘“‘information.’’ He determined, not 
merely to modify convention by progressive changes, but 
to break with it altogether. ‘‘The English public schools 
seem to me bound not so much by red tape as by barbed 
wire.” His position as headmaster of a private school, 
which, when he bought it, contained only fourteen boys, 
enabled him to do as he liked. He hated rules. The right 
use of rules “is one of the chief points of the magnificent 
training which cricket affords for the greater game of life. 
Don’t be a slave to rules. Use them as short and easy 
memoria technicas of the principles on which they depend

of Loretto and its ‘‘mad” head. In 1862 came open

disuse of waistcoats and the practice of runs in wet

(could there be a greater evidence of a headmaster’s 
persuasive powers?), in 1870 the abandonment of hats, in 
1872 “anatomical boots” and changing into flannels for 
games, in 1874 the habitual use of flannels. Some at least 
of these hygienic reforms have spread to the whole nation.

REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION 
ie HE education of women was probably at its lowest 
ebb about half a century ago,” wrote Miss Cobbe 
in her Autobiography, published in 1904. ‘It was at that 
period more pretentious than it had ever been before and 
infinitely more costly; and it was likewise more shallow 
and senseless than can easily be believed. To inspire young 
women with due gratitude for their present privileges, won 
for them by contemporaries, I can think of nothing better 
than to acquaint them with some of the features of school 
life in England in the days of their mothers. I say advisedly 
in the days of their mothers, for in those of their grand- 
mothers things were by no means equally bad. There was 
much less pretence and more genuine instruction as far 
as it extended!.” She goes on to describe one of the 
numerous fashionable schools which clustered in Brighton. 
The cost was {500 a year! Work lasted from morning 
till night. During the one hour’s walk, when alone the 
girls were in the open air, French, German, or Italian 
verbs were recited. During the rest of the time, they were 
reading or reciting in one of these languages amid the din 
of four pianos in various rooms, or practising accomplish- 
ments. On Saturday they were all hauled before the 
assembled mistresses and told what ‘“‘cards” they had 
lost for any crime from lying to stooping, both of which 
were treated alike! Then girls at the top of the school 
along with the rest were made to stand with their faces to 
the wall. Everything was done for “‘society.” Music, 
dancing, and calisthenics counted highest in the scale of 
subjects, writing and arithmetic lowest. The girls were only 
allowed to speak English after six in the evening. Learning 
thirteen pages of Universal History by heart was typical

of the workin subjects which make a call on the intelligence?. 
Miss Sinclair’s novel Modern Accomplishments (1837), 
though its didactic pietism makes it hard reading in the 
twentieth century, paints a similar picture of the private 
education of girls of the higher classes. It looked solely 
to marriage: it starved the intellect, and induced a self- 
centred attitude of trivial frivolity. Even the accomplish- 
ments in which it took pride were unreal; the pupils could 
neither paint, draw, play nor sing properly ; nor had they the 
least desire to pursue these occupations except for display. 
The text-books tell the same tale. Girls were excluded 
from classics and mathematics, the only subjects of which 
the educational value had been in the least thought out, 
and were brought up on catechisms and epitomes, de- 
signed to give an appearance of familiarity with names and 
events which it would be considered a mark of ignorance 
not to know, but leaving the pupils utterly unaware of 
the facts which these names represented. F. D. Maurice, 
writing in 1826 in the Metropolitan Quarterly Magazine, 
says of such text-books: ‘‘In these volumes are contained 
“all that is really important’ in history, viz. the dates of 
the events which it records—in biography, viz. the time 
when the gentlemen and ladies it signalises came into the 
world and left it—in chemistry, viz. its nomenclature— 
in astronomy, viz. a list of the fixed stars. All such slight 
and unimportant particulars as relate to the nature of 
those events whereof the period is so accurately ascertained, 
in what causes they originated, what was their influence 
at the time and what their ultimate consequences—all 
trivial fond records of the persons who had the excellent 
fortune to be born at such a time and place and to die 
at such another—all knowledge of the chemical principles 
and processes which are indexed by those barbarous names 
—all study relating to the connection of those fixed stars 
with the other parts of the system to which they belong and 
the laws by which that connection is regulated, and the

wonderful discoveries by which the fact of their existence 
was éstablished—all these are subjects for the intellect, and 
therefore in the works we have referred to they are carefully 
and prudently omitted.” ‘‘The imagination is a terrible 
object of the dread, the hatred, and hostility of the mistresses 
of establishments and the governesses of young ladies.’’ 
Herbert Spencer tells us something of the physical side 
of girls’ education. He had both a boys’ and a girls’ school 
close to his house; the boys were always playing, but of 
the existence of the girls’ school, so silent was it, he was 
long unaware. “The garden affords no sign whatever of 
any provision for juvenile recreation; but is entirely laid 
out with prim grass-plots, gravel walks, shrubs and flowers, 
after the usual suburban style. During five months we 
have not once had our attention drawn to the premises by 
a shout or a laugh. Occasionally girls may be observed 
sauntering along the paths with lesson-books in. their 
hands, or else walking arm in arm.” Sir John Forbes had 
asserted in 1833 that the following was an average sample 
of the timetable: in bed, 9 hours; in school, 9 hours; at 
optional work, 34; meals, 14; a formal walk, 1. These 
demure walks, two and two, were as a rule the only exercise 
taken, though Spencer informs us that some schools had 
recently adopted gymnastics, which he proceeds to con- 
demn as an artificial and inadequate substitute for spon- 
taneous exercise “Why,” he asks, “this astounding 
difference?” And he answers his question by suggesting 
that “to produce a robust physique is thought undesirable; 
that rude health and abundant vigour are considered some- 
what plebeian; that a certain delicacy, a strength not 
competent to more than a mile or two’s walk, an appetite 
fastidious and easily satisfied, joined with that timidity 
which commonly accompanies feebleness, are held more 
lady-like.” Here we probably have the explanation of 
many of the features in a girl’s education. Possibly this 
feeling represents an unconscious first striving by women 
for the emancipation of their sex. In the fashionable 
society of Louis XIV’s time the men escaped all hard 
work, but the women were, according to the ideals of

Madame de Maintenon and her contemporaries, still ex- 
pected to exercise a practical management of the house- 
hold. The old tradition survived on the negative side, 
looking askance on woman sharing the sports of their 
brothers, but broke down on the positive side through the 
growth of a greater feeling of equality between the sexes. 
Idle men did not see why their wives should not be idle. 
Sport and the military tradition of aristocratic society 
prevented men from adopting the Chinese badge of social 
rank—the growing of the finger nails to a portentous length 
as a sign that the owner of these monstrosities could not 
be earning his bread by the labour of his hands—but there 
was nothing to prevent the growth of a corresponding 
tradition among women. 
Coming to the less expensive establishments, we have 
a description by Miss Clough, in an article in Macmillan’s 
Magazine for October 1866 of the schools frequented by 
the daughters of parents earning £100 to £300 a year. ‘The 
position of the teachers is often very painful. They are 
poor themselves, struggling for subsistence; the parents 
are economical, and there is constant haggling between the 
two. The schools are often small, and this increases the 
difficulty. The children being of various ages, the labour 
of bringing them forward, even in a few simple subjects, 
is excessive. There may be, perhaps, some twelve or 
twenty children, from the ages of six to sixteen, two 
teachers at most, and the parents meanwhile objecting to 
much expense with regard to books, and therefore com- 
pelling cheap and small compendiums to be used.” She 
goes on to note the “ few dry facts taught,’’ the “monotony 
which is very dulling to the intellect.” “Habits of close 
attention and accuracy are rarely acquired.” The curri- 
culum consisted of the “three R’s,” grammar, geography, 
history, and a little French and music. 
With regard to the “superior schools,” she pronounces 
them too small, while the small numbers in each class and 
the multiplication of classes led to loss of power. The pupils 
came ill prepared. They were expected to take too many 
subjects, mostly modern languages and accomplishments.
-P-A-G-E-248

Mathematics, Latin, English literature, and science were 
almost without exception extras and rarely taken up. 
Such schools were too expensive for parents of moderate 
means. Writing at a time when examinations were begin- 
ning to standardise the education of boys, she wishes for 
some similar standardisation of the education of girls. 
‘ Fortunately the pioneers of female education were not 
jan aristocratic intelligenzia, but a hard-headed, hard- 
| working, religiously-minded, and common-sense group of 
| middle-class women. Female education owes a great debt 
| to Maurice and Kingsley for determining who should be 
_ its first adherents. Women educators of the nineteenth 
\ century were stirred not so much by a sense of women’s 
\ rights as of women’s duties. 
“>Through his sister, who was a governess, Maurice had 
been led to interest himself in the work of the Governesses’ 
Benevolent Institution. “In the practical working of that 
society and in the knowledge of the circumstances of 
governesses which they so acquired the importance of some 
standard by which to test the qualification of ladies en- 
gaged in teaching had become apparent.” Maurice had 
since 1840 been professor of English literature and modern 
history in King’s College, London. In 1847 he induced 
his fellow professors to form a committee, of which Kingsley 
was a member, to conduct an examination. The results 
showed that it was desirable to provide some knowledge 
on which to examine before expecting the candidates to 
undergo an examination, and so Queen’s College was 
founded. A college in the modern sense it hardly was; it 
stood midway between a college and an organisation for 
promoting extension lectures. Its students included women 
of mature years and mere schoolgirls; its instruction was 
given by means of lectures, and perhaps we should regard 
them to-day as “popular lectures.” ‘‘ For such a purpose no 
endowment could be got and Queen’s College was a venture 
depending for its success on the unselfish devotion and 
energy of its founders?,” the small band of King’s College 
professors. It prospered sufficiently to be incorporated in

  Ix] REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION 235 
1853, and counted among those who attended its lectures 
the two pioneers of girls’ public schools, Miss Buss and Miss 
Beale. As time went on, it did not keep pace with the pro- 
gress in the ideas of women’s education; for instance, it still 
preserved a man principal, whereas Bedford College, which 
was incorporated at a later date (1869), has developed into 
an essential part of London University. But theimportance 
of Queen’s as marking a new idea cannot be over-estimated. 
The progress in secondary education has been found in 
this country to follow the progress of university education. 
The revival of the old universities preceded the reawakening 
of the public schools; the founding of the provincial colleges 
preceded the institution of county and municipal schools. 
So it was in the case of female education. The early attempts 
at higher education came before the first of the new type 
of girls’ schools; and the spread of women’s colleges was fol- 
lowed by the spread of girls’ schools. The causes are easy to 
see. The colleges supply teachers for the schools ; they furnish 
them with an aim; and they create a desire for education. 
It may be well therefore to trace the rise of colleges first. 
(Bedford College in London ranks next in seniority to 
Queen’s among women’s colleges.) It started in an unpre- 
tentious manner when in 1847 Mrs Reid established classes 
in her own house; it proceeded to take a more organised 
shape under a Board and Council of Management, and to 
obtain the help, like Queen’s, of a number of distinguished 
male lecturers, and, after Mrs Reid’s death, it ebtained 
formal recognition in 1869 by a charter of incorporation. 
When women’s colleges were first started there was no 
idea of women becoming candidates for university degrees 
and consequently no motive for placing them in university 
towns. But, though no such thought was in the mind of 
Mrs Reid, Bedford College was in fact situated in the seat 
of a nominal university, and its nominal character proved 
an advantage. London University, being merely an ex- 
amining board, could admit women to degrees without 
raising any of the problems of co-education which were 
presented in the case of a teaching university; and, when 
this was done, Bedford stood in the same relation to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
236 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION (cH. 
University as King’s and University Colleges. And, when 
the University was finally reorganised and became a real 
teaching institution, Bedford was able to take rank as a 
“school of the university in the faculties of Arts and 
Science.” 
But we are anticipating. The Schools Inquiry Com- 
mission marked an epoch of great importance in, women’s 
education. It suggested that girls’ foundation schools 
would soon become a reality, and the leaders in the move- 
ment for female education saw the necessity of being 
prepared with women teachers and women’s colleges to 
which the pupils of these schools should proceed. It was 
at this moment (1867) that Miss Emily Davies developed 
her scheme for founding a college “designed to hold in 
relation to girls’ schools and home teaching a position 
analogous to that occupied by the universities towards 
the public schools for boys.”’ It began in 1869 with a small 
house for six students at Hitchin. The choice of its abode 
was deliberately designed as a taking-off place for Cam- 
bridge. The prospectus distinctly stated: “The Council 
shall use such efforts as from time to time they may think 
‘most expedient and effectual to obtain for the students 
of the College admission to the examinations for the 
degrees of the University of Cambridge, and generally to 
place the College in connection with the University.” In 
those days subscriptions for women’s education were very 
hard to obtain; but in 1873 a nearer approach to Cambridge 
was effected and the College was transferred to Girton. 
Here again the peculiar system of English universities by 
which the College teaches and the university examines 
made the transition easier. Girton came within two miles 
of Cambridge but not into the town. At this distance the 
dons who favoured the scheme could give it their assistance 
and the University could not ignore its existence; but 
Mrs Grundy was satisfied. Whether the sacrifice of cab 
fares on Mrs Grundy’s altar commends itself to the 
authorities of Girton nowadays is a different matter. 
But already the sacred space within the statutory 
distance from Great St Mary’s had been invaded. Curi-
-P-A-G-E-251

ously, however, the founders of Newnham intended that 
women should be educated in Cambridge, but should not 
enter for the university examinations. Still, when Girton 
had stormed the examination-rooms and Newnham the 
residential area, they proceeded to share the spoils. 
Newnham candidates were sent in for the triposes and the 
university pomoerium was extended to take in Girton. 
Miss Clough, who first presided over Newnham, is an 
example of the kind of women who first realised the need 
of women’s education and forwarded it, not from any 
desire of display, but from a sense of duty. Long ago in * 
1837 she had taught in the Welsh National School in 
Liverpool, where she had neither instruction nor precedent 
to guide her but found out her own ways of teaching by 
the light of common-sense; she lived quietly with her 
brother Arthur the poet; and sometimes she visited ele- 
mentary schools elsewhere to get experience. “It is from 
a sense of duty,’ she wrote, “that very many first enter 
on this work {of educating the poor], but I would rather 
speak of the great benefits we may ourselves derive from 
this employment, of the many holy thoughts and aspira- 
tions after self-improvement that are awakened by engaging 
in the instruction of others. Then it is, perhaps, that we 
first learn to love our native land and to desire heartily 
that its people may grow up, not a curse or a shame to it, 
but rather a blessing and a glory. Our family ties, our 
friendships hardly teach us this, but it is when we are 
thrown upon the simple connection or bond of being fellow- 
countrypeople, of speaking the same mother-tongue and 
living in the same place, that we become truly national.” 
One of the marked features of her work at Liverpool was 
the interest which she continued to display in her pupils 
after they had left school. In 1852 she left Liverpool for 
Ambleside and started a school in which the future 
Mrs Humphry Ward was one of her pupils. It developed 
as a school for the daughters of small tradespeople and 
farmers—a type of school of which, as we have seen, far 
too few existed—and furnished the experience which led 
to the writing of the article in Macmillan’s Magazine in 
   
-P-A-G-E-252

  238 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION [cH. 
1866 from which we quoted earlier in the chapter. In the 
highest work of a schoolmistress, her influence over her 
pupils and the effect she had on their characters, her innate 
qualities made her most powerful; but, owing to her lack of 
training, she could never be “‘ methodical,’ and her school 
might not have commended itself to the inspector of those 
days, to whom the anise and cummin were more than the 
weightier matters of the law. In 1861 her brother Arthur 
died, and in the following year she removed to Combe Hurst 
near Wimbledon, where she became acquainted with Miss 
Emily Davies, Miss Bostock, and Miss Buss, and came into 
the full centre of the movement for women’s education. 
In 1856 a woman candidate had presented herself for 
the London medical diploma and had been refused ad- 
mission. In 1862 the same thing happened when a woman 
wished to sit for the matriculation examination. A pro- 
posal to admit women to matriculation was rejected in 
Convocation by the casting vote of the Chancellor, Earl 
Granville. The promoters of the movement now organised 
themselves. In 1863 they secured that girls should be 
allowed unofficially to take the Cambridge Local papers; in 
1865 the practice was given an official trial for three years 
and at the end of that period was accepted permanently. 
In 1867 Miss Clough gave the evidence before the Schools 
Inquiry Commission which formed the basis of her article 
in Macmillan. One of her proposals was the establishment 
of courses of lectures in big towns which could be attended 
by the more advanced pupils in girls’ schools. A committee 
for organising such lectures was set up and various pro- 
minent men came forward to give them. This was virtually 
the start of the University Extension system, which was 
thus given practical shape by women. In its turn this 
movement gave rise to the demand fora higher examination 
for women, and in 1869 the Cambridge Higher Local 
Examination was instituted. Out of the need of preparing 
women for this examination Newnham developed. Henry 
Sidgwick, professor of moral philosophy at Cambridge, 
started lectures, and among the distinguished lecturers 
were Maurice on history, Skeat on English, Mayor on
-P-A-G-E-253
  Ix] REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION 239 
Latin, and Marshall on political economy. In order to 
allow students who were not natives of Cambridge to 
attend these lectures, Sidgwick took a house in Regent 
Street on his own responsibility and invited Miss Clough 
to act as its head. Beginning with five students in 1871, 
it moved the following year to Merton Hall, ‘‘a rambling 
old house buried among apple trees in a large garden on the 
edge of the town.” In 1879 it was decided to build and the 
older portions of the present Newnham College were erected. 
Girton and Newnham at first worked on somewhat 
different lines. Girton objected to separate examinations 
for women and demanded that they should be allowed to 
enter for the same examinations as men. Whether or no 
this is educationally the sounder plan, it had obvious 
advantages as a matter of policy. Men’s examinations 
had already an established reputation, and, if women 
could gain the same honours as men in them, it was easily 
understood by the outside public for what those honours 
stood, and the suspicion that women’s examinations were 
not only different in kind but inferior in quality was 
avoided. In 1870 Girton obtained the informal use of the 
papers in the Previous Examination and in 1873 of the 
tripos papers, and was thus able to say that its students 
had fulfilled all the requirements for degrees demanded of 
men. In 1881 the university gave a formal recognition of 
this arrangement. But between 1873 and 1881 much else 
had happened; in 1873 twenty-two out of thirty-four 
professors formally opened their lectures to women, and 
in 1879 they were admitted to college lectures; in 1878 
London University obtained a supplemental charter by 
which it was empowered to admit women to degrees on 
the same terms as men. In 1880 it so happened that a new 
university, Victoria, was founded on the federal principle, 
and its charter provided for giving degrees to women, 
though the conditions were left to its constituent colleges. 
The next university founded, that of Wales, from the first 
admitted the two sexes on an absolute equality; and all 
later foundations have followed the same precedent, while 
the new colleges and universities already existing have 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  240 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION [cu 
fallen into line. The approximation of Newnham to Girton 
and the foundation of the women’s colleges at Oxford, of 
which the first two, Somerville and Lady Margaret, date 
from 1881, completes the tale of developments in the 
university education of women. It was not till after the 
War that Oxford opened its degrees to women and Cam- 
bridge in the present year has again refused. Since 1887, 
when the first proposal to this effect was madeat Cambridge, 
it has been discussed several times at both universities, but 
till the War was always rejected by the votes of non- 
residents in Senate and Convocation. Undergraduate pre- 
judice combined with the conservatism of their parents 
united to produce this result ; and when the country parson 
had revisited the scenes of his youth, replenished the empty 
purse of his offspring, and registered his vote against 
awarding to a woman who has taken a first class in the 
tripos the letters which reward his own third in the special, 
his son united with the rest of his college in signalising the 
success of their efforts by a bonfire. The argument most 
frequently used at these debates was that the M.A. degree 
conveyed the right of having a final voice in university 
legislation; but, in view of the way in which this right has 
been used, it is more than probable that it will be one of 
the first abuses to which the recently appointed Com- 
mission will devote its attention. 
Women’s colleges in their earlier days were not quite 
what they are now. Perhaps undue imitation of men, not 
because men’s pursuits would naturally be sought for their 
own sake but because they are men’s pursuits, is now a 
little too prevalent. It is a passing phase, which will dis- 
appear when woman’s position has become well established 
and no novelty. In the modern universities we have already 
reached the stage when, if a woman’s name is the only one 
in the list of first classes in any subject, there is no more 
demonstration of surprise in the newspapers than if it had 
been a man’s. Examiners may pass “A. Smith” without 
knowing whether the “A.” stands for Alfred or for Anne. 
But in 1880 the head of a woman’s college was necessarily 
in a state of constant alarm lest any of her protégées should
-P-A-G-E-255
Ix] REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION 241 
give the enemy the least occasion to blaspheme. A male 
undergraduate, whirling a rattle on the towpath, is of 
course deemed to be only acting according to his kind; 
but a burst of laughter coming through the windows of 
Regent Street might have postponed the success of the 
cause for a decade. In fact her biographer thinks it for- 
tunate, in the days when the “capable woman” was 
suspected, that Miss Clough ‘did not dress well or walk 
well, and had a certain timidity and irresoluteness”’; that 
“there was nothing of the direct, vigorous and masterful 
about her which young people and indeed crude people of 
any sort mistake for strength.” ‘‘It sounds rather a fan- 
tastic comparison, but I often think her sayings were like 
the work of the early painters, all the more effective be- 
cause the artist has not yet subdued his medium; sheer 
force of character and feeling has risen over the difficulties.” 
And, if her rule was such that one of the students suggested 
that Newnham should take as its crest Mrs Grundy ram- 
pant and two students couchant, yet she goes on to suggest 
that “‘in nineteen cases she was troubled for nothing, but 
in the twentieth she may have avoided a disaster.” 
We now return to an earlier period and describe the rise 
of secondary schools for girls. Two protagonists stand out 
in this connection, Dorothea Beale and Frances Mary Buss, 
and round their lives the events of the movement may be 
clustered. 
Miss Beale was born in 1831. Fortunately ill-health 
compelled her to leave school at thirteen—she herself is 
responsible for the word “fortunately ’’—and in a cultured 
house she had opportunities for omnivorous reading such 
as a clever boy of the time, much more a clever girl, might 
envy. It was no idle browsing, but solid fare such as first- 
rate historians, Euclid, sciénce, reviews, biography. At 
sixteen she went for a year to a school for English girls in 
Paris—to be driven home by the Revolution of 1848. Then 
she attended the newly founded Queen’s College and later 
took an active part in the teaching of that institution. In 
time she became dissatisfied with its working and closed 
her connection with it in 1856. For a year she was on the 
A.S.E. 16 
     
-P-A-G-E-256
  242 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION {cH. 
staff of the School for Clergymen’s Daughters, an evangeli- 
cal foundation, in which she was expected to teach Scripture, 
arithmetic, mathematics, ancient and modern history, 
geography, English, French, German, Latin and Italian. 
The result was to make her miserable for a year, which 
fortunately did no lasting harm, and to make her feel the 
need of a reform in girls’ education, which has done lasting 
good. Of course she left at the close of the year; if she had 
been the woman to stand such a curriculum, she would not 
have been the woman to make a success of the College at 
Cheltenham. 
Cheltenham Ladies’ College had been founded in 1853 
to educate the sisters of the boys whose parents flocked to 
Cheltenham to send them to the boy’s College. Its first 
few years were not too prosperous and in 1858 a new head- 
mistress was sought. It was almost an accident which 
made Miss Beale think of applying, and quite an accident 
which led the committee to appoint her. Indeed they had 
hardly done so before they began to repent; for Cheltenham 
was the favourite abode of the strictest sect of the Evan- 
gelicals—not the Evangelicals of our days, but the old- 
fashioned Calvinists to whom the orthodox view of pre- 
destination was more precious than all the promises of the 
Gospel. It was rumoured that Miss Beale was High Church, 
and a kind of inquisition into her beliefs was set up. Of 
course Miss Beale was not High Church, but she was a deeply 
religious woman who felt her religion to be so close a per- 
sonal communion with God that she would not allow it to 
be twisted into the procrustean bed of cold intellectual for- 
malism. Such a religion the committee did not understand, 
but they came to the conclusion that it was hardly of a 
kind to warrant the cancelling of an appointment already 
made. So they practically told her not to talk too much 
about it, and Miss Beale was not the kind of person who 
would want to parade her religion in public. So she com- 
menced work. 
We must not think of her in those days as the dictator 
of a female Eton and Trinity rolled into one, or as the 
national institution which she subsequently became. She

had a long and strenuous struggle before success became 
assured. The idea with which she started was not to make 
girls’ education a copy of boys’. She was not preparing for 
the university; she had not her eye on external examina- 
tions. She was guided entirely by what she thought girls 
needed; but she thought they needed something equally 
substantial, though not identical, with what was needed 
by boys. She began by pruning ‘‘accomplishments,” 
though she reintroduced the teaching of the piano in spite 
of the opinion of her Council concerning ‘‘the singular and 
extraordinary notion that dexterity of fingering on a single 
instrument is the most important part of female educa- 
tion,’ to which notion they are inclined to attribute “the 
acknowledged deficiency of many of the fairer sex in 
logical qualities and reasoning powers.” She laid great 
. stress on English history—not taught after the manner 
satirised by F. D. Maurice; and hoped to make of German 
the equivalent of what Latin was in boys’ schools. She 
dare not introduce Euclid at first; “had I done so, it 
might have been the death of the College.’”’ Though the 
pupils were not sent in for public examinations, an examiner 
from Oxford or Cambridge visited the College annually. 
By 1864 the period of uncertainty was over; there were 
a hundred and thirty pupils, and a boarding-house was 
opened to retain girls whose parents were leaving the town. 
In this year Miss Beale resorted to a change as regards 
the hours, which had hitherto been arranged on the plan 
usual in boys’ schools. She now experimented with a 
morning lasting from nine till one o’clock, broken by a 
half hour’s interval, keeping the afternoons for individual 
music lessons and such extras. The plan was adopted by 
Miss Buss in the following year and became the standard 
allotment of hours with the schools of the Girls’ Public 
Day School Company. 
The Schools Inquiry Commission was such a landmark 
in girls’ secondary education that we will break off the 
account of Miss Beale to trace the career of Miss Buss up 
to that event. She was four years older than Miss Beale; 
like her was educated at an absurd school of the old type 
16—2

    244 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION (cH. 
and like her made up for it by private reading. Her mother 
had been forced through her husband’s death to start 
a school; and Miss Buss began to teach at the early age of 
fourteen. She again reproduces Miss Beale’s career by 
going to Queen’s College, but she found her vocation earlier. 
With the help of the Rev. David Laing she gave a semi- 
public character to the family school in 1850, and, as her 
biographer Miss Ridley puts it, speedily ousted Child’s 
Guide and Mangnall’s Questions and the idea that even 
such mild gymnastics as jumping over a stick held a few 
inches from the ground was unladylike. 
We have now reached the Commission. Its terms of 
reference contained no indication that it was intended to 
deal with girls’ education; its framers so completely forgot 
girls that they forgot to exclude them. The promoters of 
girls’ education saw their opportunity and petitioned the 
Commissioners to investigate the subject, and the Com- 
missioners consented. Miss Buss and Miss Emily Davies 
were invited to give evidence in 1865 and Miss Beale in 
April 1866. Miss Beale was doubtful if girls could go so far 
as boys, at any rate in subjects like higher mathematics, 
and she was against an over-assimilation of the education 
of girls to that of boys on another ground, that the educa- 
tion of boys itself was largely based on tradition and might 
soon be modified. On the former point Miss Davies was 
more confident. She had for two years been acting as hon. 
secretary for the girls’ side of the Cambridge Local 
Examinations during the period in which they had been 
used for the examination of girls informally and experi- 
mentally, and she was convinced of the identity of standard. 
The Commissioners’ Report drew public attention to 
what had hitherto been within the interest and knowledge 
of the few. “Want of thoroughness and foundation; 
slovenliness and showy superficiality; inattention to rudi- 
ments; undue time given to accomplishments, and these 
not taught intelligently or in any scientific manner; want 
of organisation—these may sufficiently indicate the 
character of the complaints received.” By his work in 
making himself responsible for the part of the Com-
-P-A-G-E-259
  rx] REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION 245 
mission’s enquiry which dealt with the education of girls, 
Mr James Bryce did yeoman service to the cause. But 
women too had suggestions and proposals. Miss Clough 
was for establishing a university board for female education, 
a system of central day schools with which private schools 
should be associated for certain subjects and the system 
of extension lectures in large towns which we have already 
seen was shortly afterwards started. To a book of essays! 
published in 1869 Miss Wolstenholme contributed a well 
thought out discussion of the needs of women’s education, 
entitled “The Education of Girls, its present and future,” 
which began with the remarkable recognition that we are 
the worst educated nation in Europe. The upper classes 
sacrifice everything to accomplishments, and of true 
learning they say, “It will not help her to get married.” 
The lower middle classes neglect education, because it has 
no pecuniary value: ‘“‘we cannot appraise the value of 
a cultivated mind; presumably therefore it has no value.” 
Teachers are not themselves well taught, and they do not 
know how to teach others. It is noticeable that Miss Wol- 
stenholme takes for granted the need of a professional 
training of teachers as much as the need for their improved 
general education—this was certainly not an imitation of 
masculine education! Women must master the secrets of 
combination and co-operation; they must do away with 
the superstition that one person can teach everything (and 
everything included a great deal if the School for Clergy- 
men’s Daughters was a typical example.) External 
examinations are a necessity if the mass of worthless 
schools are to be brought into line. The replacement of 
governesses by schools is necessary if effort is to be used 
to the best advantage. Governesses’ work “means giving 
an infinitesimal fragment of time and a divided and a 
distracted attention to each of the pupils and subjects in 
turn.’”’ Small schools involve these evils almost more than 
does private instruction; therefore schools must be big. 
“We wonder much how many schoolmistresses ever framed 
1 Women’s Work and Women’s Culture, edited by Josephine E. 
Butler, 1869.
-P-A-G-E-260
246 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION [cH. 
a consistent course of study which should stretch over six 
years. We wonder still more how many have successfully 
carried it out in the case of even one pupil.” In a word 
organisation is needed. But to the most obvious way of 
securing large schools, by copying the boarding-school 
system of boys, she is opposed. ‘‘ Perhaps the best that 
can be said of them is that the inherent evils may by 
skilful teachers be reduced to a minimum; but it can never 
be considered very desirable to bring together great num- 
bers of young people and throw them into the intimacy 
of an English boarding-school, without far more careful 
oversight than it is easy to secure, whilst any approach 
to the system of perpetual espionage would be at once 
hateful to our English notions and, as we believe, fatally 
mischievous to both teachers and pupils.’”’ Hence there 
is needed in every town a “High School’”—a term soon 
destined to become familiar—and possibly also a “‘second- 
ary school” under municipal or government control which 
would serve as a model to the private schools for which 
there would still be abundant room. For country districts 
she suggests schools which did not themselves take in 
boarders but licensed small boarding-houses under the 
charge of married ladies. She supports mixed schools where 
funds do not allow of separate boys’ and girls’ schools. “It 
is not proposed to argue that a system of mixed education 
would be of unmixed advantage; it is quite sufficient to 
show that the balance of advantage is in its favour.” 
Finally more women’s colleges of the Hitchin type are 
required and education must be brought to people’s doors 
by extension lectures. “Equality of education must pre- 
cede equality of industrial training”; and it is not only 
industrial training for which education is needed; it is 
wanted no less for the home, where it will increase the 
influence of mothers and will further the rational inter- 
course of husbands and wives. 
We ask the reader to pardon us for quoting from this 
essay at so much greater length than from the report of 
the Commission; but it is important to know what women 
thought about women’s education without seeing it after
-P-A-G-E-261

it has been refracted through the minds of men. For, 
however much men helped by collecting funds, by giving 
lectures, and by sharing in the business management, it 
was women who determined what women’s education was 
to be, and it largely worked out along the lines of Miss Wol- 
stenholme’s essay, which may therefore be taken as fairly 
representative of women’s views. 
The Endowed Schools Act did something directly for 
girls’ education. “In framing schemes under this Act, 
provision shall be made as far as conveniently may be for 
extending to girls the benefits of endowments.”’ To ensure 
that the Commissioners appointed under the Act carried 
out this part of their instructions an Association was formed 
“for Promoting the Application of Endowments to the 
Education of Women.” Schemes were gradually made, 
and, wherever the funds were not exhausted by the boys’ 
schools, girls’ schools were set up. The first were four 
founded out of the surplus funds of King Edward’s School, 
Birmingham, which were at once filled. These were all 
of the second grade, but in the reorganisation of the 
wealthy Bedford foundation first and second grade girls’ 
schools were set up. Both these were among the eight 
wealthiest foundations with regard to which the Schools 
Inquiry Commission had presented separate reports; 
among the other schools in this list, Dulwich, St Olaves, 
Tonbridge and Monmouth were made to set up girls’ 
schools, and in 1898 Miss Zimmern calculated that there 
were over eighty endowed girls’ schools. 
But the process of securing the transfer of endowments 
was slow and in the meantime private endeavour had to 
step in. Naturally it is with schools of the first grade that 
private endeavour is most effective. In 1871 Mrs Grey 
formed a National Union for the education of women 
which in the following year established the Girls’ Public 
Day School Company. In five years fourteen schools were 
founded and many more have been since added. The 
importance of the work does not end here, since their old 
girls have become mistresses all over the country and 
impressed the methods of these schools on many others 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
248 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION [cH. 
which are unconnected with the Company. On the whole 
it may be said that, as regards curriculum, the wish to 
demonstrate the intellectual equality of the sexes, and 
for this purpose to prepare girls for the same school 
examinations and the same university courses as boys, has 
led to an acceptance of the usual boys’ curriculum; but 
that as regards organisation and method, women have 
struck out on new lines. In the first place they have thrown 
the weight of social prestige on the side of day schools. This 
is of far-reaching importance; it means, apart from the 
educational ideal of keeping school and home in touch, the 
possibility that every town can develop a really fine school, 
unhampered by a crushing competition with fashionable 
boarding-schools which draw away the best pupils from 
every locality. This again means that parents of moderate 
means have access to the very best education possible. 
Hours are different. Discipline is different; perhaps more 
strict, but more secured by personal influence. Class- 
rooms are, or were till recently, brighter. A working spirit 
has always prevailed. There has always been a great 
friendliness between teachers and taught. The average 
schoolmistress thinks more about methods than the aver- 
age schoolmaster. She is less conservative and more aware 
of new ideas. She knows more of other types of. educa- 
tion beside that in which she is herself occupied. Literature, 
art and other cultural subjects are taught with more 
genuine enthusiasm and welcomed with ‘less regard to their 
examination value. The school is a more civilising influence. 
There is no tradition from the ages of barbarism to wear 
down. Headmistresses looked to what girls naturally were; 
headmasters have looked to what boys after a hundred 
years’ tradition of idleness, bullying, housing in hovels, 
and worship of physical strength, had become. It is 
lamentable to think how the advantages of education are 
lost by a girl in a mixed school, The docility of girls makes 
them easy victims to the examination grind. A head- 
master, brought up in the tradition—which he probably 
does not acknowledge even to himself—that, in order to 
get the right amount of work done, you must set twice as

much as you want, to allow for the waste of boys’ “‘ca’ 
canny” methods—for schoolboys were the real authors 
of modern trade union methods, and public schoolboys 
can still give points to the miners—-institutes for his con- 
scientious girl pupils a veritable Egyptian bondage, harms 
their health, crushes their vitality, destroys their interests, 
and forces them discendi causa doctrinae perdere causas. 
Miss Buss’s school was to a large extent the model of 
the ‘High Schools,’’ as the schools of the Company are 
commonly called. In order that it might thoroughly con- 
form to her ideal, she now took the extraordinarily self- 
sacrificing step of turning it into a trust, ‘thus in addition 
to the loss of personal freedom risking a present certainty 
and the prospect of future affluence, to accept for the next 
three years a greatly diminished income with doubled or 
trebled work; giving up at the same time assured honour 
and widespread reputation for misunderstanding, suffering, 
and disappointment?.” After such an example the cause 
of private schools against public schools was lost. Under 
the new scheme there were to be two schools, the North 
London Collegiate School in Camden Street of the first 
grade and the Camden School of the second. Subscriptions 
came in slowly; but £20,000 from the Platt Charity could be 
assigned to the schools now they were on a public footing; 
the Clothworkers Company also came to their assistance; 
and the new scheme finally took effect in 1879. As one of 
her obituary notices put it:—‘‘A personality of singular 
charm and of what the slang of the day calls ‘magnetism,’ 
wholly without pedantry or self-consciousness, persuaded 
Royal Commissioners, City Companies, Lord Mayors and 
Royal Princesses, physicians and even universities, that 
women might be thoroughly educated without any danger 
to themselves or to the State.’ 
(tis Buss was indeed a great personality, and some of 
thechief features which are brought out in Miss Ridley’s 
biography may be noted. Her attitude to her pupils was 
motherly, at a time when “prunes and prisms” were the 
tradition. She needed to punish little; she could talk any

pupil into a determination to be reasonable for the future; 
henceforth in that pupil’s case she might have to deal with 
faults of carelessness and thoughtlessness but not with 
faults of wilfulness. She remembered every pupil years 
afterwards. She was generous in helping girls in money 
difficulties and her generosity to the school passes words. 
She bore patiently periods of waiting, hopes, fears, and 
suspense. She won the affections of her staff. All her life 
through she was able to absorb new ideas. 
As regards her policy, she was opposed to boarding- 
schools, and gave up her boarding-house as soon as she 
could, thus sacrificing a source of deep interest to her 
principles, as she sacrificed her pecuniary interests. She 
greatly believed in the influence of the school buildings and 
in absolute orderliness and tidiness. She could smile at 
her own enthusiasm in this matter, as when she said 
“T spend my life in picking up pins.’’ On this feature of 
girls’ schools which, perhaps partly through her influence, 
has become universal, the mere man does not pretend to 
pass judgment. Cloak-room and corridor rules, which seem 
to be to headmistresses the mark of a standing or a falling 
school, would provoke a mutiny among boys. But all will 
agree that when orderliness passes into hygiene, it ceases 
to be a fetish. She made her pupils come to school dry. 
“It is an amusing symptom of the hygienic influence of 
the North London School that, in my quest for properly 
shaped shoes, I find it best to fall back on the neighbour- 
hood of Camden Road?.” She virtually had a private 
system of medical inspection and records in her school long 
before anyone dreamt of the Medical Inspection Act. On 
the results she determined what calisthenics each girl 
needed. She wished headmistresses to have the same 
independence from their goveming bodies"as headmasters. 
School-masters will perhaps like to know what is the female 
counterpart of Thring’s tact in reinforcing discipline by 
a sense of humour. Thring had just introduced tidy desks 
and was starting what to the boys must have appeared an 
autocratic and cranky attack on a cherished privilege which 
1 Op. cit, p. 222. 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
Ix] REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION 251 
was supported by the prescriptive right of centuries—he 
had forbidden them to cut their names on them! No boy 
could believe he really meant it. No boy could at least 
resist the temptation to determine the point by the 
scientific method of experiment, even at the risk of a 
flogging. The first two criminals were haled before Thring. 
He might have secured his desks by flogging the boys; but 
that was not the method of a disciplinary artist. He took 
them to the woodwork room and made them carve their 
names on the hardest piece of wood which it contained. 
It took them the afternoon. Miss Buss too had the artistic 
instinct which declines the use of the sledge-hammer when 
a finer weapon will do the work. Our mothers know that 
fainting-fits were in their younger days the chief of the 
minor trials of governesses. We leave Miss Ridley to tell 
the tale. She ordered the “very coldest water that could 
be procured.” “There is no sort of danger in this kind of 
attack, and the most certain cure is a sudden dash of very 
cold water in the face.’’ The water was on its way. “Ah! I 
feel better now, thank you!” “If you feel a little faintness 
coming on, just retire to your own room without saying 
anything about it. Shut your door, open all the windows 
and lie down quietly. You will soon find yourself wellagain.” 
Her theory of intellectual education for women was thus 
summed up: “It may be—I am much disposed to think 
it is—that intellectual training effects greater moral 
improvement in women than it does in men because a 
woman’s faults of character, on an average, turn more on 
irrationality and lack of nerve control, while the man’s 
faults centre in his profounder self-absorption and slower 
sympathies.” Educational theorists have not ceased 
arguing whether the curriculum suitable for a pupil is 
that which develops his strong points or that which counter- 
acts his weak points. Probably a different answer should 
be given according as we are considering efficiency or 
personality. -If you are thinking of a person’s capacity to 
do things, it will, by the law of diminishing returns, pay 
to teach him what he can learn easily. But efficiency in 
this narrower sense may be completely cancelled by faults 
 
-P-A-G-E-266

252 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION [cH. 
of temperament which have not been checked by the 
formation of counter-habits. A particular kind of work 
which gives a low measure of efficiency may be of supreme 
value as a corrective. To cure a man of consumption does 
not directly train the muscles which he will use as a navvy; 
but, unless you cure his consumption, he has no chance 
of becoming a good navvy. Hence Miss Buss attached 
considerable importance to Science, a subject which has 
no aesthetic content, though French and history were her 
own specialities, and the North London School became 
famous for its scientific results. 
Meanwhile the Cheltenham College continued to make 
great strides. Miss Beale, though reluctantly, realised the 
practical necessity of sending her girls in for external 
examinations. Her first experience of the “locals” had 
brought out a weakness in the mathematics of the school, 
which, once detected, was soon rectified. Pupils began to 
pass the London Matriculation examination, and com- 
plaints of overwork began to be heard. Parents had to be 
taught that overwork too often meant that school work 
was expected to be an extra to a full round of social engage- 
ments. But Miss Beale’s faith in day-schools was not 
shaken, and parents were gradually trained to see the 
matter in its true light. In 1875 new buildings were under- 
taken, the college having reached three hundred, and in 
1882 further extension was necessary. In 1875 too the 
governing body was reorganised in such a way as to 
recognise the fact that the college was a national and not 
merely a local institution. It started merely as a school, 
but it developed into something which has no counterpart 
in boys’ education in modern times. Its nearest parallel 
is the Renaissance ideal of an institution which should be 
school and univefsity in one. At the one end it has its 
Kindergarten, at the ‘other its students working for the 
Higher Locals and London degrees. It is now organised, 
under the supreme control of the Principal, into a series 
of departments under responsible heads. The college course 
for girls over sixteen is preceded by the work of its secondary 
school department from twelve to sixteen and that again

Ix] REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION 253. 
by the work of its preparatory and Kindergarten depart- 
ments. It isa miniature educational system in itself. Many 
of its pupils of course pass on to the older universities, and 
a special hall at Oxford, St Hilda’s, has been built for them; 
but in itself it offers a full course for the London degrees. 
Though Miss Beale was a believer in day-schools, boarding- 
houses grew up, as was inevitable in the case of an in- 
stitution unique in the country. With its five hundred 
pupils it has almost eclipsed the boys’ college. 
The building up of this great institution was more com- 
pletely the work of one individual than any educational 
development of which we can think in the nineteenth 
century, save possibly Dr Barnardo’s Homes. Miss Beale 
had a good eye for form mistresses, but hers was the con- 
trolling spirit. Organisation with her, as with every great 
headmaster or headmistress, did not mean what it often 
means in a government department, sitting in an office and 
devising general rules which approximate to the right way 
of dealing with all cases but which exactly fit none. The 
girls at the top of the school she knew intimately, and she 
strove to know all. She taught and did not merely direct 
teaching. Little energy was frittered away in red tape. 
She inspired her pupils with the devotion, not unmixed 
with awe, commonly felt only for a sovereign. But her 
internal life was one of prayer and meditation. She was 
like the mediaeval monarch who wore a hair shirt under 
his royal robes. In her teaching the class caught her 
enthusiasm for the subject-matter, whether it were litera- 
ture or the joy of intellectual discovery in mathematics. 
Her literature lessons were her chosen vehicles of revealing 
her views on life and conduct. “Miss Beale might be un- 
academic to a fault in these lectures, but she had that power 
of inspiration which made every poem she prized, every 
character she admired, live immortally for those who heard 
her speak of them. The actual reading—specially of poetry 
—was a delight to both teacher and hearers. Miss Beale 
had a strong dramatic instinct, a keen enjoyment of 
poetry and the right use of words. She had also a wonder- 
ful voice, which she managed well, and though always
-P-A-G-E-268
  254 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION [CH. 
quiet and restrained in manner carried her audience with 
her unweariedly!.”” Her Scripture lessons were to her the 
event of the week and she reserved Friday evenings entirely 
to their preparation. By the time Miss Beale and Miss Buss 
died, the public had come to realise that a great headmistress 
\ should be treated with the same respect as a great head- 
master. Arnold had his bitter opponents, Thring his 
critics; but no one would have dreamt of regarding either 
as a fitting object of mild witticisms. In the case of great 
headmistresses familiarity does not breed contempt; the 
smiles were only on the faces of those who had never met 
them, and those who knew them best respected them most. 
By 1881 Miss Buss was able to write to Mrs Grey: 
“There is now no such thing as a ‘woman’s education 
question’ apart from that of education generally; and the 
real question which has still to be fought for many a long 
year, I fear, is one as old as education itself: how is the 
child of either sex to be trained to the measure of the 
stature of the perfect human being.” Suffice it therefore 
to say that the Act of 1902 spread girls’ education as 
widely as it did boys’, and that the Act of 1918 will give 
them the same advantages as boys in respect of continua- 
tion and central schools, which, though now classed as 
elementary, fulfil the functions which the Schools Inquiry 
Commission vainly tried to get performed in their own day 
by what they described as the sadly deficient third grade 
of secondary schools. 
In one respect, however, we do not think that the ques- 
tion of the sexes as regards education has been solved. We 
refer to the problem of co-education. Co-education is 
vigorously at work in all grades of education. At the 
infant or Kindergarten stage there is nothing else and 
no one would probably want anything else. In elementary 
schools up to the age of twelve, provided the children 
come from good homes, the system seems to work well. 
The absence of home-work prevents the danger of over- 
pressure; and the mistresses seem to play a relatively more 
important part than in mixed secondary schools. But even 
1 Elizabeth Raikes, Dorothea Beale of Cheltenham, p. 262.   
 
-P-A-G-E-269

here it might be argued that too often the size of classes 
reduces personal influence to a minimum and that this is 
the reason why it makes so little difference which sex 
appears to be influencing it. Again at the other end it 
seems acceptable at the university stage. But it must be 
remembered that at Oxford and Cambridge and to some 
extent in London, the colleges, which are the real teaching 
organisations, are not mixed, though the university is, 
and that everywhere the lectures are not the supreme 
educational instrument which the students sometimes 
imagine them to be. Some sort of tutorial system exists 
whereby there is closer contact of mind with mind between 
male tutor and male student and female tutor and female 
student. But at the age between twelve and eighteen 
experience throws much doubt on the merits of co-educa- 
tion. Ideals are then forming, and the ideals of the two 
sexes are quite different. No man can be a good school- 
master unless he “understands boys”; every man admits 
that. No woman can be a good schoolmistress unless she 
understands girls: we suppose every woman would admit 
that. But does any man claim that he “understands 
girls?” He largely understands boys because he has been 
a boy and because he still has something of the boy in him; 
we surely mean more by the phrase than when we say that 
a man understands dogs or horses. Unless we believe in 
transmigration, we know that he has never been a girl. 
With regard to young children of either sex, Nature seems 
to have implanted in women a maternal intuition which 
enables them to understand them. Men seem not to have 
this intuition, nor do women as far as the adolescent boy 
is concerned. And, what is equally important, girls cannot 
find in masters the friends they find in mistresses. A 
“just beast” is no good for girls. “Old Smith” would be 
quite happy if his boys voted him ‘‘a decent old sort”; 
but girls incline to hero worship. Masters who are of an 
age and temperament to make good ‘“‘elder brothers” of 
their boys can stand in no known relation to their girl 
pupils. Some of the schools of the Society of Friends appear 
to work the system with perfect success, but we imagine 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
256 REFORM OF FEMALE EDUCATION [cH. 
it is done by a wonderful power of mutual delegation of 
functions between masters and mistresses rendered possible 
by the strong corporate solidarity of such a community. 
The early Christians could doubtless have run a mixed 
school with success in the catacombs. Strange as it may 
seem, it is easier in a boarding-school than in a day-school 
because masters and mistresses are compelled to see more 
of one another. In a day-school it seems to tend to em- 
phasise the idea that the relation between teacher and 
pupil is limited to the class-room. The girls seem to suffer 
far more than the boys. The head is practically always a 
man. He makes it a boys’ school to which girls are dlso 
admitted. Boys in their teens are a barbaric race; they 
glory in physical strength; they lack imagination and 
sympathy; and they despise what they do not understand. 
Little boys and little girls are conscious of no great differ- 
ence in instincts and tastes. University men and women 
are conscious of a difference and feel bound to respect it. 
During the intervening years boys half-unconsciously 
exercise a forceful mastery over girls. The girls cannot 
assert themselves; and they lose the power of self-govern- 
ment which their sisters in girls’ schools learn as much as 
boys. Later on, perhaps, they come to talk about the 
equality of the sexes, but they are no longer equal, because 
the boys have stolen a march on them. 
Having thus traced the growth of female education, we 
must ask the question, What has been the result? Slight 
passing disadvantages, perhaps; but the suffragettes who 
have arisen as the bye-product of the emancipation of a 
sex count for little against the bolshevists who have arisen 
as the bye-product of the emancipation of a class. Apart 
from this transient inconvenience, who can doubt the gain? 
The empty-headed, silly woman could find no interest but 
frivolity; she could not be a solid factor in the bringing up 
either of her sons or of her daughters; she was powerless 
to influence her husband; if she remained unmarried or 
became a widow, she could not support herself; her peculiar 
gifts were lost to the State. Society is built up by that 
which every part supplieth; legislation needs women’s

sympathy as well as men’s sense of justice; administra- 
tions should be human as well as businesslike; patience 
is wanted as well as driving-power. In the war educated 
women showed more of the Spartan mother than did the 
older type. They did not feel less, but they saw further. 
The growth of girls’ education has not been without its 
influence on that of boys. There being no tradition, girls’ 
education had to be thought out from first principles. The 
true basis of curricula had to be examined, and it is possible 
that girls’ schools have strengthened the fight against 
allowing the teaching of literature to be degraded into 
a memorising of notes, and the teaching of musicand art 
into a mechanical drill in technique. Women have dis- 
covered that girls at school are not totally different beings 
from girls at home, and the methods of discipline and 
influence in the one are not based on entirely different 
principles from those adopted in the other. The traditional 
discipline of boys could not bear a sudden transition; but 
there is a growing recognition that the boy is not all 
hobbledehoy, though maybe he camouflages other elements 
in his nature in deference to the traditions of his school, 
and only reveals that he cares for things of the mind 
and taste when he goes up to college. In one particular the 
opinion of women has throughout been diametrically 
opposed to that of men. Women have always believed in 
the professional training of teachers. Miss Wolstenholme 
regards training and the degree as reforms to be pressed 
for equally. Miss Clough attended the lectures on teaching 
at Queen’s. The Maria Grey Training College founded in 
1877 commemorates Mrs Grey’s services to education. 
Miss Buss helped in the establishment of training classes 
by the College of Preceptors in 1873, the first attempt of 
the kind in secondary education, and she began the agita- 
tion in 1885 which led to the foundation of the Women’s 
Training College at Cambridge. ‘Could anything be done,” 
she asked, “to avert this growing danger that the teaching 
profession should fall into the two classes of those who are 
highly educated and not trained and of those who are 
trained but not highly educated?” Miss Beale established

Should any male reader be tempted to think that, in 
suggesting that boys’ education has ever learned or could 
ever learn anything from that of girls, we are taking a 
purely theoretic standpoint, we will ask him to consider 
whether Thring is not a proof to the contrary. Thring is a 
type of the forceful dominating headmaster who under- 
stood and governed boys: but Thring was an enthusiast 
in the cause of women’s education, and it is remarkable 
that the reforms which he effected in boys’ education are 
just on those points where girls’ education has pursued 
a different path from that which had been traditional in the 
case of boys—the importance of the average pupil, the 
influence of a beautiful and comfortable environment, the 
need of getting down to the real human being in boys and: 
piercing through the defensive crust of convention, the 
use of art, literature, and music as educational instruments, 
and the importance of thinking out new methods and not 
accepting traditions on trust.

CHAPTER X 
POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 
ITHERTO we have been considering mainly the 
improvements in the existing supply of education: 
henceforward we shall principally be tracing its spread to 
classes of the population which hitherto had been unable 
from lack of funds or lack of tradition to avail themselves 
of it. 
The new universities claim our first attention. Of the 
foundation of London University and its subsequent 
reduction to the position of an examining body we have 
already spoken. The requirement of a College certificate 
of attendance was abandoned in 1858; at the same time, 
in order to give some indication to candidates whether 
they were pursuing their studies on right lines, the inter- 
mediate examination was added. The two original colleges 
continued to do good work of a real university kind; and 
even the external examinations, though falling short of 
the university ideal, encouraged many persons to pursue 
higher studies who would not otherwise have done so. One 
especial advantage in the new degrees was the encourage- 
ment of study in subjects which lay outside the restricted 
range of classics and mathematics, to which the older 
universities almost confined themselves. It is true that 
these subjects were not studied by methods which brought 
out their full educational value; “‘cram” was tolerated in 
order to secure that the subjects should be studied at all. 
Among the subjects which thus received encouragement 
was natural science, but the unwillingness to accept a 
course in scientific subjects alone as a qualification for the 
time-honoured degree of B.A. led to the institution of a 
special B.Sc. degree; and the newer universities have 
herein all followed the London precedent. Whether this 
divorce was advantageous educationally is doubtful; 
17-3

certainly it was not justified by the historical meaning of 
the word “‘arts,” for the original ‘‘liberal arts” included 
three branches of natural science—arithmetic, geometry, 
astronomy—as well as three linguistic subjects—grammar, 
logic and rhetoric—and one fine art, music. 
The second of the new universities, Durham, attempted 
to reproduce Oxford and Cambridge, and was not a uni- 
versity of the newer type. Strangely enough, Oliver 
Cromwell was the original author of the idea of setting up 
a university for the North of England at Durham out of 
the cathedral funds; and it was a little strange that the 
Church should herself revert to the plan of old-time spoiler. 
A university with residential colleges, situated on the 
banks of a river in an old cathedral city, clearly belongs to 
the old order; but its absorption in 1882 of the Newcastle 
medical school brought it into touch with the life of a large 
modern industrial town and it now combines within itself 
the two elements, the old represented by the Arts side 
permeated by a strong clerical influence and housed under 
the shadow of the cathedral, and the new by the Armstrong 
College of Science situated in busy Newcastle. 
It is with the foundation of Owens College, Manchester, 
however, that we come to the rise of the special type of 
university college, and afterwards of university, which the 
nineteenth century made its own. The history of Owens is 
largely reflected in that of its successors. It is possible 
that, had the Universities Tests Act been passed twenty 
years earlier, we should never have seen this type. But 
Owens College was just in time to win indisputable success 
before the Act was passed. It is curious that the College 
must be jointly assigned to Owens, a radical and non- 
conformist, and Faulkner, a tory and churchman. Owens 
wished to make Faulkner his heir, and Faulkner suggested 
the idea of a college. Owens left £97,000 and wisely laid 
down that the money was mainly to be spent on staffing 
before elaborate buildings were erected. It started in 1851 
with five professors, two lecturers and sixty-two students. 
At first its prospects did not appear promising. By 1857 
the number of students had sunk to thirty-three and the
-P-A-G-E-275

newspapers pronounced it ‘‘a mortifying failure.” But 
from the appointment of Greenwood (1857-1889) as prin- 
cipal, it never looked back. In 1861 it absorbed the Working 
Men’s College, founded in 1858 on the lines of F. D. Maurice’s 
efforts in London. By 1864 it had 127 day and 312 evening 
students. It is curious to reflect that, even in 1868, when 
money was required for building, both Disraeli’s and 
Gladstone’s governments refused to give it State assistance. 
Probably the government exactly reflected the popular 
failure to realise that anything was being done which in 
the future would be regarded as a landmark in educational 
history. Outside their own towns the modern universities 
in their earlier days were treated with worse than opposi- 
tion—they were ignored. Manchester as a city may look 
back with pride to the days when it saw its university 
through, unhelped and untalked of from without. The 
College devised a new constitution in 1871, opened its new 
buildings in 1873, began to admit women in 1874, and pro- 
posed to become a university in 1875. The previous year 
Yorkshire, however, had taken steps to start a college at 
Leeds; for it is a law of nature which rests on the surest 
inductive evidence that if Lancashire has anything to its 
credit, Yorkshire will not be long left behind, and that if 
Yorkshire has found anything good, Lancashire will not 
be left in the cold. Neither Lancashire nor Yorkshire, 
however, wished to pursue a dog-in-the-manger policy, 
and it was eventually arranged that the new university 
should be federal, and should be so constituted as to em- 
brace Owens College from the start, the Yorkshire College 
at Leeds as soon as it had completed its organisation, and 
a college at Liverpool as soon as it could be found. The 
new university received its charter under the name of the 
Victoria University in 1880. 
The Yorkshire School of Science was opened in 1874 
and was, even more definitely than Owens, primarily a 
technological institution; but from the start W. E. Forster, 
the author of the Education Act of 1870 and M.P. for 
Bradford, foresaw that it might develop into a university. 
With the prospect of becoming a constituent college in

Victoria University, the College developed an Arts side and 
dropped the words “‘ of Science” from its title. The growth 
of the older studies and the technological branches side 
by side is shown by the dates at which various departments 
were added; biology, engineering, mining, and classics in 
1876; English and history in 1877; French and German in 
1878; philosophy and dyeing in 1879; the inclusion of the 
medical school and its complete equipment in 1884; art 
and accountancy in 1887; leather, agriculture, a teachers’ 
training department and organic chemistry in 1891; metal- 
liferous mining in 1898; electrical engineering and law in 
1899; economics in 1902, not to speak of later develop- 
ments. The Clothworkers Company gave buildings for 
textile industries and dyeing in 1880 and a new set of 
buildings for arts and science was erected in 1885. 
University College, Liverpool, was founded in 1881 and 
was designed from the first as a constituent college of 
Victoria. In 1884 Liverpool, like its predecessors, took over 
the pre-existing medical school. Among the characteristic 
schools which it had already developed, before the time 
when it sought incorporation as a separate university, were 
those of agriculture, commerce, law, marine biology, 
tropical medicine, hygiene, and dental surgery. 
The federal system was for a time accepted as the natural 
form of organisation for provincial universities. It was 
adopted in Ireland and in Wales. The Welsh Colleges were 
founded in the early “eighties” and, like all other univer- 
sity colleges before they attained university rank, began 
by preparing for London degrees. Their development into 
the University of Wales in 1893 will be traced in the special 
chapter on Wales. 
Before the end of the century the federal system was 
found to have grave disadvantages. hat these were 
comes out in the discussion which arose when Liverpool 
proposed to defederalise Victoria University. This step was 
hastened by the incorporation of Birmingham University 
as a single institution. Birmingham has had two colleges. 
The first, Queen’s, was founded as a 
logical school; but the medical school grew while the

theological withered away. In mid-Victorian days we 
presume that the atmosphere which suited Mr Bob Sawyer 
was uncongenial to the budding curate. But the College 
from which the university sprang was Mason College, 
founded in 1870 by Josiah Mason “‘to promote thorough 
systematic education and instruction adapted to the 
practical, mechanical, and artistic requirements of the 
manufactures and industrial pursuits of the Midland 
District,” ‘to the exclusion of mere literary education and 
instruction, and of all teaching of theology.” The present 
generation is in danger of forgetting that, till the day when 
Joseph Chamberlain resigned from the Home Rule Cabinet 
in 1886, Birmingham stood for everything which was 
modern, radical, practical, businesslike, efficient, bourgeois 
and anti-clerical in English life and politics. Manchester 
was modern, but it was not consciously hostile to what was 
venerable. Birmingham was the natural home for a uni- 
versity which should have nothing to do with a “mere” 
literary education. But even Josiah Mason was obliged 
to make concessions in order to secure recognition for his 
college from any institution empowered to grant degrees. 
The college was opened in 1880 and in a supplementary 
deed of 188r he allowed Latin and Greek and “such a 
course of study as shall qualify for degrees in arts and 
science in the Victoria University or the London University 
or any other university of which the institution shall form 
part,’ though it was still to bear the name of the Mason 
Science College. The deed clearly contemplates the destiny 
of Mason College as being to enter Victoria or to form part 
of a new federal university. But by 1900 the idea of 
entering Victoria as junior to Manchester, Liverpool and 
Leeds did not satisfy the ambitions of Birmingham. 
Joseph Chamberlain was the most powerful man in the 
British Empire and was identified, as no other statesman 
has ever been identified, with his native town. So Bir- 
mingham became the first university in England which 
was instituted for a single provincial city. Though it no 
longer felt any revolutionary thrill of pleasure in defying 
tradition by incorporating the sentiments of Tom Paine

The example of Birmingham gave a Ee to the Colleges 
of Victoria. Time is money in these no: 
the waste of time involved in travelling 
business meetings of the University caus! 
to fall mainly into the hands of those on thern towns, and 
to Manchester for

the spot. In order 
to carry on the internal management, Liverpool and Leeds 
professors had toleave their classes ; and, naturally, meetings 
were reduced to a minimum, and long delays took place 
before necessary things were done. The examinations 
became more like those of an examining body such as 
London, the teaching being adjusted to the examinations 
rather than the examinations to the teaching. Before the 
close of the century Liverpool was peluioaing for separa- 
tion. Leeds, however, felt that it was not strong enough 
to stand on its own feet. A counter-agitation was started, 
and carried some weight with graduates who felt that 
Victoria degrees had attained a prestige which would not 
   
-P-A-G-E-279
  
x] POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 265 
be associated with the degrees of single-college universities. 
Till the system was tried, there was some genuine alarm 
lest a system by which a teacher had more weight than 
anyone else in passing or failing and giving classes to his 
students would open the door to personal idiosyncrasies 
and favouritism. Even under-cutting as regards standard 
between the three universities was prophesied. Manchester 
however supported Liverpool, the two Colleges gained the 
day, and none of the fears of the alarmists have proved 
well-grounded. The academic conscience and tradition of 
standards has proved equal to the trial, and the work of 
external examiners, who were instituted as a necessary 
safeguard, is now mainly confined to fostering an inter- 
change of views between various universities. 
Since Victoria was separated into three universities, all 
have added new departments and removed any surviving 
doubt as to their claim to be worthy of the name of uni- 
versity. Sheffield (1875) and Bristol (1876) university 
colleges have been also constituted universities, and 
Nottingham is looking in the same direction, though it is 
interesting to note that Leicester and Derby have put 
in a plea for a federal university, just as Leeds and Liver- 
pool did in the case of Victoria. As they all more or less 
reproduce the history of the universities which we have 
already considered, it will not be necessary to trace their 
growth individually. 
London University has at last reorganised itself as a 
true teaching university. The movement in this direction 
commenced in the two original colleges, University and 
King’s, which felt that they represented the true intention 
of the University, which had been snowed under by its 
examining functions. The Royal Colleges of Physicians 
and Surgeons also wanted the right of conferring medical 
degrees, since the University had been so sparing in granting 
the degree of M.D. that students were driven elsewhere in 
the most important years just before they began to practise, 
in spite of the fact that London hospitals afforded an 
unrivalled field for getting experience. An association for 
promoting a teaching university for London was formed in
-P-A-G-E-280
    266 POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION {[cu. 
1884, but the university, though favouring the idea, could 
not be induced to agree on any concrete scheme for realising 
it, and it was necessary to resort to the usual expedient of a 
Royal Commission. The Commission reported in 1889 that 
the university should be reformed on a teaching basis, that 
the right of becoming constituent colleges should be con- 
fined to institutions situated within the County of London, 
that the colleges should be adequately represented on the 
governing bodies of the University, that the medical 
organisations should not be given the right of conferring 
degrees but that the university ought to grant medical 
degrees more freely, and that the work of external ex- 
amining shouldbe retained but subordinated to the internal 
work of the university. It was left to the university itself 
to frame a scheme to give effect to this policy. The problem 
of producing order out of chaos in London was, from the 
point of view of sheer organisation, the most complex 
that has ever presented itself in academic history. There 
were more students in London than in any city in the 
Empire, yet they were scattered amongst p host: of utterly 
dissimilar institutions. There were whole-time students 
and evening students; general students, professional 
students, technical students; men, women, boys, and girls; 
middle-class students and artisans. The two old colleges; 
the women’s colleges; the medical schools attached to the 
hospitals; the Inns of Court; technological institutions like 
the Government School of Science, South Kensington, and 
the City and Guilds Institute; working-men’s institutions 
such as the City of London College, founded in 1838, with 
2000 students, Maurice’s Working Men’s College with 500 
students, and the Birkbeck Institute; various training 
colleges for teachers and theological colleges; all these 
existed without any organic connection, with totally 
different histories, and many of them almost unconscious 
of each other’s existence. We are not altogether surprised 
that the university entirely failed to devise a scheme of 
union. Public opinion came to look on London University 
as a steam roller that had broken down and stuck in 
the mud, if we take a metaphor suited to its unwieldy

bulk, or as Humpty Dumpty after his fall, if we think 
rather of its fragmentary condition. 
University and King’s in despair now reverted to an 
earlier project of leaving the existing university by the 
roadside and starting a new teaching university which, in 
memory of the Elizabethan worthy who had first conceived 
the idea of a teaching university for London, should be 
called the Gresham University. Parliament vetoed this 
proposal and set up a new Royal Commission, which in 
many words said ditto to the previous commission. ‘On 
a general review of the evidence laid before us on” the 
subject of internal versus external examining, “it would 
appear that the stress laid by witnesses on the importance 
of placing examinations in the hands of teachers has been 
in proportion to the extent to which they were regarding 
the higher and more progressive departments of study and 
the effect on the individual minds of the taught rather than 
the conditions to be imposed upon pass students, or the 
necessity of exacting for the professions a rigidly uniform 
standard of qualification.” The last clause refers to the 
fact that the medical schools were the only teaching 
institutions which still supported the external system. 
Eventually a constitution was worked out and accepted 
in 1900, but in complexity it rivals that of the British State 
and it would be impossible to expound it in detail without 
writing a second volume. It is chiefly based on the fact 
that the greater part of the teaching institutions with 
which it is connected are of a specialistic kind. Hence its 
main principle is organisation by faculties, the various 
institutions being recognised as “‘schools of the univer- 
sities” in one or more faculties. University and King’s 
Colleges have been incorporated within the University (the 
former in 1907, the latter in 1910), and the University 
maintains several other teaching institutions of its own 
for specific purposes. The women’s colleges, Bedford and 
Holloway, are schools in the faculties of arts and science; 
the medical schools of the hospitals in the faculty of 
' medicine; and in various faculties the East London College, 
the Imperial College of Science and Technology, the Royal

interesting feature which has been carri 
of the 1895 commission, which would have been impossible 
at an earlier period, is the formation of a faculty of theology 
which includes six ‘‘schools,’”’ two Church of England, two 
Congregational, one Wesleyan and one Baptist. 
After this record of isolated the comb facts, the reader 
h DUCATION [cu. 
     
naturally asks what has been the combined effect of the 
whole movement. In the first place, higher education has 
been opened to all classes. The child of a working-man who 
wins a scholarship from the elementary school may by the 
aid of scholarships continue his or her education till twenty- 
three or twenty-four and enter any occupation to which 
he is suited. The working-man who grows up a working- 
man may receive any form of scientific or industrial educa- 
tion which fits him for his craft, or evening instruction to 
improve his general culture. Ability can move more freely 
where it can be most effective and the nation makes a 
better use of its original supply of brains. In the second 
place, education is brought nearer to the doors of those who 
desire it. Every city of 300,000 inhabitants has its uni- 
versity and a map showing the distribution of universities 
will readily bring out that every big area, save possibly the 
extreme south-west, is served. In the third place there has 
been a revolution in the conception of the subjects which 
are suited for university studies. The humanities have 
indeed been spread more widely than ever before, since 
there is no single university in which there are not a con- 
siderable number of “‘arts” students. There is a more 
thorough study of the subjects required for the old pro- 
fessional faculties—theology, law, and medicine. But these 
changes are overshadowed by the revolution which has 
been produced in the attitude of the industrial world 
towards technological work. American manufacturers 
discovered the use of university men in their works before 
England; but England is rapidly following suit. Engineer- 
ing, mining, metallurgy, chemical industries, textiles,
-P-A-G-E-283
   x] POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 269 
leather, dyeing, even brewing, look to the universities for 
researchers and managers. Even the oldest and most 
conservative of all industries in the world, agriculture, 
has begun to send its pupils to college. Short-sighted 
critics sometimes complain that culture is being sacrificed 
to materialism. They forget that a system which confines 
educational prestige to the humanities makes directly for 
the production of what the Germans call Hungerkandidaten, 
young men with a degree but unable to earn a living. An 
unsuccessful intellectual class is the breeding-ground of 
revolutions. The Jews of old taught every boy a trade as 
well as the law and the prophets. Every university man 
should be taught a profession. It is true that in the two 
old professions of the Christian ministry and of teaching 
general culture plays a large part and that a graduate with 
a good record and a certain innate fitness for those occupa- 
tions is well-advised to devote more time to the humanities 
than to theology or pedagogy; but he must be sure that 
he has the innate qualities. There are, besides these pro- 
fessions, a very few openings for the picked few, and it is 
well that only those who are likely to be among that picked 
few should take up a course of studies which does not 
obviously lead anywhere. But the great bulk of those who 
receive a higher education with special reference to their 
occupation would never receive a higher education at all, 
if the only kind open was of a purely cultural character. 
And even the most specialised technological education at 
the higher stages results in a considerable bye-product of 
cultural education. Applied science can only be built up 
on a good foundation of pure science, and pure science in 
its turn needs a previous training in mathematics and in 
the exact use of language, and benefits by a knowledge of 
modern foreign languages. Further, the longer that edu- 
cation is continued and the more that technical instruction 
is accepted as a natural part of the university course, the 
less effort is made to encroach on school days, which are 
left freer for a general development of those parts of our

It is no loss to accept brewing and dyeing into the univer- 
sity curriculum if we thereby restrict the range of book- 
keeping and type-writing in schools. 
The extension of universities and university colleges 
was mainly the work of private generosity and municipal 
patriotism ; but the time came when Parliament recognised 
it as a matter of national concern, and to-day it would be 
impossible for the work to be continued on an adequate 
scale without help from public funds. The first treasury 
grant of £15,000 was voted to university colleges in 1889. 
Most provincial universities are considerably aided out of 
the rates; and, in addition to direct grants, access to them 
is aided by municipal exhibitions. The final step was taken 
at the close of the War when the two old universities of 
Oxford and Cambridge applied for state aid, and a Royal 
Commission under the presidency of Mr Asquith was set 
up to consider on what terms it should be granted. State 
aid of course means a certain measure of State control. 
This has mainly been exercised in securing that universities 
should maintain a really high standard of university work, 
and in particular in the encouragement of research. After 
all, State control is no new thing in academic history: 
nothing that is now likely to happen will compare with 
the sweeping changes effected by the Crown in the century 
which followed the Reformation or possibly even with 
those which resulted from the Victorian commissions. 
The extension of education, other than elementary, to 
the working classes and the supply of technical and techno- 
logical education considerably overlap, though of course 
there is a considerable area of working-class education 
which was intended primarily to be cultural and a con- 
siderable area of technical education which by its nature 
removes the recipient from the category of working men 
in the ordinary use of the term. We propose to treat briefly 
the spread of cultural education to working men up to the 
time of the Technical Instruction Commission first, then 
to devote more space to the organisation of technical 
instruction, and finally to make a short survey of the spread 
of working-class education in more recent times.

Birkbeck’s movement, the first of its kind, was technical 
in much of its subject-matter, though it was distinctly 
cultural in its results. But, by an almost inevitable trans- 
formation, the Mechanics’ Institutes became less and less 
working-class and more and more middle-class in their 
membership; and many survived only as institutions for 
providing libraries, reading-rooms, and occasional popular 
lectures. The decline was marked after 1848. But there 
were numerous exceptions; the highly successful Birming- 
ham and Midland Institute was established in 1853. Those 
which retained their original purpose were able to take 
advantage of the South Kensington grants after 1859, of 
grants from the City and Guilds Institute after 1879, and 
of the ‘“‘whiskey money” after 1890. Thus there has been 
continuity from beginning to end and the original Birkbeck 
Institution is now a part of London University!. 
The Co-operative movement, as an effort of the more 
thoughtful and independent workmen, who were con- 
siderably fired by the enthusiasm of Robert Owen and 
of the Chartist leaders, produced a certain educational 
stimulus amongst its adherents and led to the foundation 
of a number of evening schools and lending libraries. 
The Young Men’s Christian Associations were a cultural 
agency which can be said to have furthered the cause of 
education in the wider sense. They originated with the 
assembly of a few young men, mostly drapers’ assistants, 
under George Williams in 1844, and developed rapidly in 
the decade between 1855 and 1864. Their object was 
primarily religious, but from 1845 educational lectures 
were given in Exeter Hall for the next twenty-one years; 
mutual improvement and literary societies were formed; 
and from 1849 reading rooms and libraries were instituted. 
Their main function may be defined as an organisation of 
the rational use of leisure. 
The University Extension movement may next be 
noticed. In the middle of the century the term had not 
acquired its present significance, but was applied to any

steps which might be taken for the admission of poorer 
students to the older universities or for the foundation of 
- newer institutions of higher learning. In its modern sense 
it arose, as we have seen in the chapter on women’s edu- 
cation, out of the invitation given in 1867 by a committee 
of ladies in the north of England, to Mr James Stuart, a 
fellow of Trinity, to lecture to their organisation. He 
followed up his course to the ladies by arranging similar 
courses to working men in several northern towns, and 
the main features of University Extension—the course of 
lectures as opposed to the single lecture, the printed 
syllabus, and the written exercises—were thus fixed before 
the movement received official recognition in 1873 from 
the University of Cambridge. London followed in 1876 
and Oxford in 1878. The movement spread rapidly. In the 
North of England in particular it appealed to working 
men; and many were the instances where severe economies 
were practised and long distances covered to be able to 
attend the lectures. Probably the payment of a fee caused 
them to be more highly valued than would have been the 
case had they been gratuitous. It is easy nowadays to 
criticise the system; in spite of the written exercises and 
the voluntary examination at the end, it trusted mainly 
to the efficacy of oral addresses to large audiences. The 
lecturers were generally men who knew how to present 
a subject clearly and in a manner calculated to excite the 
interest of a popular audience; yet, except with trained 
hearers, lectures to large assemblies are bound to lack many 
of the elements which go to make up real teaching. The 
lecturer is only indirectly. able to infer whether his points 
are understood; and, what is more important, the listener 
is liable to confuse a vague impression for a clear under- 
standing. The first thing to do with the untrained mind 
should be to make the learner realise the precise meaning 
of everything which is presented to him, and conversation 
and questioning are usually the only methods by which 
this can be secured. But we must not under-rate the 
importance of the Extension system as a means of arousing 
interest in intellectual matters, which is a condition pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  x] POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 273 
cedent to true intellectual training. Even if it goes no 
further, a man with intellectual interests is a nobler being 
than one with none. In particular an appreciation of 
literature and a wider outlook on the development of 
human history could be given without making severe 
intellectual demands. Economics, a subject of profound 
interest to working men, is on the other hand a subject to 
the profitable study of which previous intellectual training 
and accurate thinking are indispensable; and natural science 
is so technical that the lecture system rarely attempted to 
deal with it. Outside the north of England the Extension 
lectures could get good audiences, but they appealed less 
to the working man, and the hearers were more largely 
people of leisure, especially women who had been brought 
up in the days when girls’ schools gave little satisfaction 
to minds keen for information and women’s colleges were 
few. The summer meetings of extensionists at a university 
town began in 1888. The movement has by no means lost 
in popularity up to the present day, but the development 
of a better system of intellectual training by means of 
Tutorial Classes has diminished its importance as a means 
of adult working-class education. 
Of Maurice’s Working Men’s College enough has been said 
in a previous chapter. One lasting effect of his work was 
to interest many minds in the universities in the lives of 
their fellow citizens in the slums of great towns, and so to 
revive that connection between the universities and the 
masses which was so large a factor of their influence in 
the Middle Ages but had been completely lost since the 
Reformation. This influence is specially associated with 
the name of Arnold Toynbee, who was appointed a tutor 
of Balliol in 1879. Unhappily his career was cut short in 
1883; but in this short space of four years he had helped 
to create a new atmosphere. At the university he was 
engaged in humanising the teaching of economics. Orthodox 
economics till that time was for the most part unctuously 
optimistic. Its tone savoured of that adopted by the 
exponents of “design” in the early years of the century. 
In the one case natural and in the other case economic laws

were so arranged as to lead to the greatest happiness of 
the greatest number with the least possible trouble or 
inconvenience to anyone. The reign of tooth and claw was 
ignored by the one, the squalor and misery of the slums 
by the other. Toynbee turned attention from economic 
theory to economic history, from the ideal to the reality. 
He emphasised the meaning of economic laws in their 
effect on the lives of men. Outside the university he gained 
the confidence of the working classes by his lectures and 
his social work in Whitechapel, where his friend Barnett 
was vicar of St Jude’s. 
In 1884 Canon Barnett, as he afterwards became, 
founded the first university settlement in the slums and 
calledit Toynbee Hall in memory of his friend. It had a large 
number of successors, which benefited the slum-dwellers 
by the cultural influences which they brought to bear and 
the university men who came to reside there by the know- 
ledge which it gave them of the conditions under which the 
submerged tenth lived. The problem of the slum has not 
yet been solved; for it is one of the saddest social laws that 
the classes who suffer most are least able to remedy their 
lot, and it is probable that in the future, even when the 
working classes as a body improve their position by their 
own efforts, the help of the intellectual classes whom 
Barnett and his imitators enlisted in the cause will be 
needed to work out practical steps for the rescue of the 
class which has sunk too low to know of any path along 
which it can seek its own redemption. 
Polytechnics bring us more closely to the sphere of 
technical education and the modern State system of edu- 
cation. In their initiation, however, they were as much a 
private and philanthropic effort as any of the other 
institutions which we have been considering. In 1880 
Mr Quintin Hogg obtained a building in Regent Street, 
known as the Polytechnic, which had been used by Pepper 
of Ghost fame as a kind of scientific entertainment hall, 
and converted it into an institution which has preserved 
the name, but given it an entirely new sense. His objects 
were partly religious, partly social, and partly educational;
-P-A-G-E-289
  x] POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 275 
his methods may be described as a combination of 
those of Maurice and those of the Y.M.C.A. He aimed 
at getting the young men of the shopman and artisan 
class; and, when polytechnics became an organised type 
of institution, the age was defined as being from sixteen 
to twenty-five. His institute comprised a library and a 
gymnasium, and its activities included concerts, debates, 
a natural history society, a savings bank, excursions, 
swimming, and rowing. Its teaching side developed more 
rapidly than he had ventured to hope. The first year he 
had 6800 members, who paid ten shillings a year or three 
shillings a term. The classes were mainly in connection 
with the City and Guilds Institute, the teachers being 
registered by the Institute and paid by results. Among 
the industries taught were brick-laying, metal-plate work, 
electrical engineering, plumbing, watch and clock making, 
carriage building, photography, tailoring, and printing. 
It so happened that a royal commission on the parochial 
charities of London had reported in 1880. The original 
purpose of most of these charities was shown to be un- 
suitable to modern needs, and an act of 1883 appointed 
a body of trustees to deal with all except those of five large 
parishes. The charities of a secular character were found 
to bring in an income of £50,000 a year. After allotting a 
part to such educational purposes as free libraries, the 
trustees assigned the rest to the promotion of polytechnics. 
They laid down as their principles that the institutions 
-which benefited should give instruction in the principles 
of the arts and sciences which underlie crafts and in the 
application of such principles to particular trades, that 
they should be a supplement and not in substitution for 
the workshop or place of business, that they might give 
instruction suitable for intending emigrants and hold 
lectures and concerts, encourage gymnastics, drill, swim- 
ming, and other forms of bodily exercise, and institute 
clubs and societies, libraries, museums and reading-rooms, 
that their educational facilities should be equally open to 
both sexes, that the fees should be'small, and that drinking, 
smoking and gambling should be prohibited. 
18—2

  276 POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION [cx. 
Among other institutions which benefited by these 
charities one may be singled out for special notice. The 
scheme suggested by Sir Walter Besant in All Sorts and 
Conditions of Men materialised in the “ People’s Palace,” 
which received £7000 from the Drapers’ Company and 
developed on its educational side into the East London 
College which now forms a ‘‘school’”’ of London Univer- 
sity in the faculties of ;Arts, Science, and Engineering. 
There is after all something to be said for our haphazard 
way of letting our educational institutions grow. If London 
University had been planned as Berlin was and had been 
made according to pattern, it would have been fully 
equipped and would have had magnificent buildings, with 
departments for every kind of learning and facilities for 
every kind of research, but would it have included a college 
in the East End to bring university education to the doors 
of the people? Just because the English educational system 
is so hard to describe and bring to rule, it is flexible enough 
to meet all needs. 
We now turn from the movements which aimed 
primarily at bringing education, whether cultural or 
vocational, to the working classes, to the series of steps 
by which technical instruction was carried forward with 
an eye rather to national efficiency in the arts of production 
and exchange than to the raising of the culture of its 
recipients. It is becoming usual to use the words ‘‘techno- 
logical” and “technical” to distinguish the two grades 
which, in the sphere of general education, are known as . 
university and secondary: but as both grew up together 
and to a large extent independently of other forms of 
education, it is simplest in a historical summary to treat 
them in a single section. 
The demand for technical instruction was the result 
partly of the scientific movement and partly of the fear 
that England was falling behind its industrial rivals. Great 
Britain had established its industrial supremacy during 
the Napoleonic wars, while the Continent was fully en- 
grossed in the struggle, by developing its mines, its metal 
industries, and its textile manufactures. It had therefore
-P-A-G-E-291
  x] POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 277 
been able to turn to the fullest possible advantage the 
invention of machinery for spinning and weaving and the 
discovery that coal could be used to develop steam power. 
England had the benefit of being first in the field, and its 
tivals had to look for some counter-advantage. To some 
extent this had been found in developing the skill of the 
workers even as earlyas the great Exhibition of 1851, which 
first suggested that this country was in some respects 
falling behind, and led to some demand for the technical 
instruction of workpeople and for a development of 
scientific teaching. It was in this year that the School of 
Mines and of Science as applied to the Arts, known since 
1890 as the Royal College of Science, was founded. In 1853 
the science section of South Kensington was added to the 
art department of the Board of Trade, and in 1856 this 
Science and Art department was transferred to the 
Committee of Council on Education. We have already seen 
how it distributed grants to local science classes and science 
schools and conducted examinations in science for teachers 
(1859-1867) and for pupils (since 1861), and how these 
Schools of Science were reorganised by Huxley in 1872. 
This last change was due to the Devonshire Commission 
on Scientific Instruction (1871-1875). 
But a marked accentuation of the demand for technical 
education took place about this date. Two powerful rivals 
entered the field, Germany and the United States. After 
its unification in 1870 under the far-seeing rule of Bismarck, 
Germany had found two great weapons for wrenching 
Britain’s industrial supremacy from her. One was scientific 
research as applied to industry; the other was technical 
instruction. The United States, which were fast changing 
from an agricultural into a commercial nation, followed 
suit. The more observant English manufacturers and 
merchants began to realise that our technical instruction 
was a mere skeleton and that any training which would 
produce scientific researchers among the highly educated 
classes was non-existent. 
The report of the Royal Commission on Technical 
Instruction issued in 1884 shows the progress which had
-P-A-G-E-292
  278 POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION [cu. 
been made up to that time. The institutions for technical 
training were of course far fewer than now—otherwise 
the labours of the Commission would have been in vain— 
but a start had been made. We will summarise their 
account of existing institutions, following their order, 
namely, first London, then the rest of the country. 
University and King’s Colleges are mentioned first. The 
former had recently built chemical, physical, and en 
gineering laboratories, had instituted a department of ap- 
plied chemistry, and employed a professor of engineering - 
who, in American fashion, was engaged in private practice 
as a consulting engineer. King’s was not far behind, though 
its engineering was of a more directly practical type. 
The Normal School of Science and Royal School of ° 
Mines, South Kensington, the foundation of which in 1851 
under a slightly different name we noticed above, had 
been reorganised in 1881. It was primarily intended for 
the training of science teachers and for “‘the instruction 
of students of the industrial classes selected by competition 
in the annual examinations of the Science and Art Depart- 
ment,” but fee-paying students were also admitted. Its 
regular three years’ course was unspecialised and consisted 
of mathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry, geology, 
astronomy, mineralogy, and drawing; in the last year 
students specialised in mechanics, physics, chemistry, 
biology, geology, agriculture, metallurgy, or mining. It 
offered twelve exhibitions of £50, six free studentships, 
twenty free places for intending teachers, and free places 
for local exhibitioners. 
The School of Design, which had since 1857 been con- 
ducted at South Kensington as the National Art Training 
School, contained 128 students and gave preliminary or 
“art teachers’”’ certificates and certificates of the third 
grade. An elaborate system of examinations was conducted 
by the Science and Art Department to encourage the 
teaching of art throughout the country, comprising twenty- 
five branches of art and divided into grades suited re- 
spectively for elementary school pupils, for secondary 
school pupils, for teachers, and for art masters.
-P-A-G-E-293

In 1877 the London City Livery Companies, after en- 
quiry abroad, had set up a committee to prepare a national 
system of technical instruction. As a result, in 1880 they 
founded the City and Guilds Institute, which subsidised 
existing educational establishments, encouraged evening 
classes in the chief towns, maintained model technical 
schools in London and inspected and examined classes else- 
where which were likely to become the nuclei of technical 
colleges. The Royal Commission took Finsbury Technical 
College (1883) as an example of their technical schools. 
It was intended as a ‘‘ model trade school for the instruction 
of artisans and other persons preparing for intermediate 
posts in industrial works.” It consisted of a day and an 
evening school, the latter giving systematic instruction to 
those engaged in the staple industries of the district, 
e.g. cabinet-making. Exhibitions were offered to pupils of 
middle-class schools. Mathematics, practical mechanics, 
physics, chemistry, electrical technology, freehand, model 
and machine drawing, workshop practice, French and 
German were taught; and there were evening classes in car- 
pentery and joinery, metal-plate work, brick laying, draw- 
ing, painting, modelling, and design. The City and Guilds 
Central Institution in Exhibition Road, South Kensington, 
which was completed in 1884, was meant to train teachers 
of technical subjects, managers of works, engineers and 
industrial chemists, and was conveniently situated for the 
science schools and museums of South Kensington: it now 
forms part of London University. 
The Commission also notice Cooper’s Hill, established 
in 1871 for Indian Government engineering students but 
afterwards thrown open to engineering students generally; 
the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, intended for giving 
instruction in marine engineering and naval architecture, 
which was mostly frequented by government students; 
the Crystal Palace School of Practical Engineering; and 
the newly founded polytechnics. 
Outside London the institutions noted are chiefly those 
which have now assumed university rank, whose progress 
has already been noticed earlier in the chapter. A few 
   
-P-A-G-E-294

words must, however, be added as to the progress of science 
and technology at the older universities. The Commission 
found little to write about at Oxford save the new Museum 
in the Parks; but science was already throwing forth 
vigorous shoots at Cambridge. Till 1871 there had been 
no practical teaching in science at that university except 
in chemistry. Then the Cavendish laboratory was built for 
physics, and Lord Rayleigh presided over it at the time 
when the Commission visited Cambridge. What it has 
subsequently become under his guidance and that of 
Sir J. J. Thomson, the present master of Trinity, it is 
unnecessary to describe. Already, the Commission note 
that Maxwell had introduced physical problems into the 
papers for the mathematical tripos, and that Michael 
Foster had brought the biological sciences to the fore, and 
they are able to notice among the names of distinguished 
Cambridge scientists those of Stokes, Humphry, Liveing, 
Dewar, Vines, Coutts-Trotter and Balfour. But they are 
compelled to remark that still “few students have time or 
inclination for original research”’: Sir James Thomson and 
others could now tell a different tale. Indeed the dis- 
coveries by Oxford and Cambridge physicists and chemists 
which helped to win the war will probably not be fully 
known for some time. 
In the more strictly technological sphere the Commission 
noticed specially James Stuart’s mechanical workshops for 
forty-two students. ‘The system of tuition is arranged on 
the basis of an actual mercantile establishment. The rate 
of wages for each student is fixed, the cost of material and 
the time employed being accurately noted and entered in 
a ledger so that the cost of every article produced can be 
ascertained.” 
The Mechanical Sciences (or Engineering) Tripos was 
the first noteworthy technological development at the 
older universities, but it would take too long to enumerate 
all the new studies which they have encouraged in recent 
years. Where a subject is not admitted into the degree 
course it has a diploma. New laboratories are constantly 
being built. Practical arts such as agriculture and forestry, 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  x] POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 281 
the oriental languages needed by Indian and Egyptian civil 
servants, social, economic and hygienic subjects required 
by public officials, are all taught. Post-graduate research 
work, long in being recognised, has found that the libraries 
of Oxford and Cambridge give facilities unrivalled except 
in London. Though the number of universities which are 
doing the work expected of such institutions fifty years 
ago may be multiplied still further, yet the higher research 
work will tend to find natural centres as in America, and 
the old universities have at last recognised their possi- 
bilities as such centres. 
The Royal Commission, whose report we have been 
largely engaged in summarising in the last few pages, forms 
a landmark in the history of technical instruction. It was 
appointed in 1880 and reported in 1884. The Commissioners 
enquired not merely into the provision of technical in- 
struction in the narrower sense, but also on the teaching 
of science, on which it must necessarily be based, from the 
elementary school upwards. Its report woke the country 
to the need not only of specialised technical instruction 
but of getting the preliminary work done in secondary 
schools, and indirectly to the necessity of providing a 
better supply of secondary schools generally. Its direct 
outcome was the Technical Instruction Act of 1889, but it 
played no small part in leading up to the Bryce Commission 
on Secondary Education and to the Education Act of 1902. 
These, however, properly belong to the chapter on the 
development of our modern State system of education® 
It remains to take a glance at the further development 
of working-class education since 1889 so far as it has 
depended on private initiative, though of course the State 
has stepped in with financial assistance whenever any 
institution justified its existence. Such assistance has 
secured the permanence and progress of pre-existing in- 
stitutions. The Mechanics’ Institutes and Working Men’s 
Colleges, however flourishing for a time, had struck on 
two rocks, the difficulty of obtaining funds when the first 
enthusiasm had passed away, and the lack of a sound 
elementary and secondary system of education as a basis,
-P-A-G-E-296
282 POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION [cu | 
They were dependent on obtaining the voluntary services — 
of good lecturers, had no whole-time staff, and ran the risk | 
of being supposed to give “popular” instruction instead — 
of promoting continuous and serious study. In the case 
of the surviving institutions founded by these movements, | 
all this passed away. The polytechnics, which were still 
in the heyday of their first enthusiasm when State aid 
came, were preserved from undergoing any subsequent 
decline. The State left them complete freedom as regards 
the social side of their activities, but required on the 
educational side that they should have a whole time prin- 
cipal and staff, proper laboratory and workshop instruction, © 
classes of a reasonable size, and a test to secure that those 
who were admitted had been properly prepared. Thus they 
have become in the fullest sense a part of the educational — 
system of the country. 
Further institutions have been founded to meet the 
requirements of London. The Goldsmiths’ Company pre- 
sented their Institute at New Cross to the University in 
1904; it was opened as Goldsmiths’ College in 1905. 
The Northampton Institute, besides providing for whole- 
time and evening students, introduced the “sandwich” 
system for seasonal workers by which they could take their 
courses during the less busy half of the year. This apparently 
new device was in reality following a very old precedent; 
the Scottish universities sat for a single session, which 
covered the six winter months, to allow their students to 
werk on the farms during the summer. In these Institutes 
internal degrees are open to evening students, and the 
literary side of education is found to be in demand as well 
as the scientific. 
In 1899 an experiment was made in the direction of 
bringing adult working-class education into touch with 
the older universities by the formation of Ruskin College 
at Oxford. It is managed by a council consisting partly 
of university men and partly of representatives of the trade 
unions, who finance it. Its object is not to provide a degree 
course for its students but to give a civic training to men 
who are likely to take a lead in working class movements.
-P-A-G-E-297
  
x] POPULAR AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 283 
Economics, sociology, and politics thus form the staple of 
its course of instruction, and there are no formal examina- 
tions or diplomas. Economy is aimed at, before the war 
the students doing their own house work and the cost 
not exceeding £52 a year. The chief danger to this in- 
stitution that has revealed itself is that, though in inten- 
tion non-political, education may receive a party bias. 
The most definite organisation, however, of adult 
working-class education in a form likely to secure a con- 
tinuous course of studies and definite intellectual training 
has been secured by the conjoint activities of the Workers’ 
Educational Association and the University Tutorial 
Classes Committees. The Workers’ Educational Association 
was formed in 1903 to arouse interest amongst the workers 
in education, to find out demands, and to organise the 
supply. It consisted of a central authority, district au- 
thorities, and local branches. Under its auspices a con- 
ference of working-class and educational organisations was 
held at Oxford in 1907 which, “affirming the growing 
desire on the part of workpeople for higher education, and 
anxious for the further co-operation of Oxford in the 
systematic teaching of historical, economic and other 
liberal subjects,’ appointed a committee which reported 
in the following year ina volume entitled Oxford andW orking 
Class Education. The report, after a short historical account 
of the various movements for working class education and 
of the work of universities in the past, proceeded to discuss 
the defects in the system of extension lectures by which the 
universities had for the last forty years been trying to 
supply teaching to the workers. They came to the con- 
clusion that the system by which each centre was expected 
to be self-supporting made a large attendance necessary 
if a deficit was to be avoided. The results were, first ‘that 
both the lectures and the subject to be studied must be 
chosen not solely or chiefly on account of their educative 
value, but with a view to the probability of their drawing 
such large numbers that the lectures will ‘pay”,’”’ in other 
words that the lectures became popular in the worst sense

of the term; secondly that with such large classes ‘‘in- 
dividual students rarely receive the personal guidance and 
supervision which is offered to an undergraduate in 
Oxford 1,” in other words that tutorial work was out of the 
question. In order to obviate these disadvantages they 
proposed the new system of tutorial classes by which “in 
certain selected industrial towns classes should be estab- 
lished of not more than thirty students; that these classes 
should pursue a plan of study drawn up by workpeople 
and representatives of the university in consultation; that 
Oxford should appoint and pay half the salary of the 
teachers by whom such classes are taught; and that such 
‘teachers should receive a status as a lecturer in Oxford?.”” 
In order to secure that the teaching should really meet the 
demands of the workmen, the classes should be organised 
by the local branch of the Workers’ Educational Asso- 
ciation. A continuous course of study should be followed 
for two years. The type of method suggested was one in 
which an hour’s lecture was followed by an hour’s discus- 
sion. There should be close contact between the lecturer and 
the students; a fortnightly essay and regular home reading 
should be expected; and the lending of books should be 
carefully organised. 
Work was immediately started on the lines of this report, 
and the example of Oxford was speedily followed by the 
other universities and university colleges. A Central Joint 
Advisory Committee was then formed by the tutorial 
classes committees of the several institutions. The Board 
of Education agreed to contribute £30, subsequently raised 
to £45, to the support of each class, and the Gilchrist 
Trustees gave valuable financial assistance. Summer 
schools came to be held regularly and the number of classes 
increased from eight in 1908-9 to 145 in the year preceding 
the war, the students increasing from 237 to 3234. 
It is difficult to foretell on what lines adult working class 
education will develop in the new period which began with 
the close of the war. The supply of an efficient system of 
secondary schools, the improvement of the machinery for

choosing county scholars and “‘free placers,” and the other 
steps for substituting an open highway for the “ladder” 
by which the elementary school pupil can climb to the 
university, have till recently been the main educational 
demands of the workers. ‘‘ Equality of opportunity” was 
the phrase which summed them up. But it is plausible to 
argue that the adult workmen of to-day who join tutorial 
classes are precisely those who, had they been born twenty 
or thirty years later, would have been caught up by the 
scholarship system and would in the end not have been 
manual workers at all. If the system of selection could 
ever be made perfect it would thus mean that all the best 
intellectual material would be gone, and the working class of 
fifty years hence would really be a mentally inferior class 
and not a body of persons who had had less opportunity 
to develop their native aptitudes. Nevertheless the present 
course of events seems to suggest that we are about to pass 
through a stage of political development in which the 
government of the country will largely rest in the hands of 
such working men as become trade union officials. The 
labour leaders of to-day are the men of innate capacities 
who grew up when no ladder existed: they are therefore 
able to combine sound intellectual qualities with real 
experience of their trades. But the education of future 
labour leaders cannot be properly envisaged till we know 
who are to succeed the Clyneses and Hendersons. Will they 
be boys of working-class parentage who have received a 
higher education and have never worked at the trades of 
whose unions they are officials? Will they be the accidental 
omissions of the scholarship system? Will they be—we 
hope not—persons who from a belief in the natural an- 
tagonism between manual workers and brain workers have 
refused to train their intellects as if they were by so doing 
committing an act of treason to their class? Dare we hope 
that there will be many who, after receiving a high aca- 
demic training, will pursue manual occupations for a time 
so as to represent the experience of their class? Or will 
the scholarship system work so efficiently that they will 
really be taken from those who were incapable of profiting

by an academic training, and, if so, will they have other 
practical abilities which will make up for the absence of 
the qualities which schools and universities value? We 
admit that the problem seems so far to be an insoluble 
riddle; but on it turns the whole problem of future adult 
working-class education, and the continuation schools only 
seem to mitigate but not to solve the difficulty.

  CHAPTER XI 
EDUCATION IN WALES 
S Wales established a State system of secondary 
education eleven years before England, and as this 
precedent possibly hastened England’s acceptance of the 
principles which were embodied in the Act of 1902, this 
seems the natural place to insert a chapter on the history 
of university and secondary education in the Principality. 
In the Middle Ages Welshmen flocked to Oxford in con- 
siderable numbers; and later Queen Elizabeth, mindful of 
her Welsh descent, founded Jesus College specially for 
them. The first project for a special university for Wales. 
was formed during the Commonwealth. The object, how- 
ever, was not to foster Welsh nationality, but the reverse. 
The Puritan government regarded the Welsh as a race of 
obstinate royalists and episcopalians, and the university 
was to be a means of converting them to proper republican 
and anti-episcopal principles. The Restoration put an end 
to the project; and, before anything more was heard of 
a Welsh university, the absentee Georgian bishops. had 
alienated the mass of Welshmen from the Established 
Church, the Methodist Revival had made religion, in a 
changed form, their main interest, and the Romantic 
movement had revived Welsh poetry, established the 
Eisteddfod, and inspired a keen interest in the antiquities, 
language, and literature of the people. 
When the great age of school foundation closed early in 
the seventeenth century, it left Wales poorly supplied 
with grammar schools. Like their English counterparts, 
they mostly sank into insignificance by the nineteenth 
century, and none of them was fortunate enough, like the 
nine ‘‘public schools,” to improve its fortunes. Such small 
schools existed at Bala, Bangor, Beaumaris, Bottwnog, Bre- 
con, Cardigan, Carmarthen, Cowbridge, Denbigh, Deythur,

Dolgelly, Haverfordwest, Hawarden, Lampeter, Llanrwst, 
Presteign, Ruabon, Ruthin, St Asaph, Swansea, and Ystrad 
Meurig. The seventeenth century, so full of interest in 
connection with Welsh elementary education, has practi- 
cally nothing to show in connection with Welsh secondary 
education. 
The religious revival was the root from which the modern 
educational movement in Wales sprang. Before the end 
of the eighteenth century the need of training candidates 
for the ministry had led to the foundation of theological 
colleges, which of necessity had to supply what was lacking 
in the secondary education of their students. Somewhat 
later the Anglican Church followed suit, as Bishop Burgess 
of St David’s found that most of his clergy had had no 
other education than a year at Ystrad Meurig, a school 
which, like others at the time and till much later, received 
adults as well as boy pupils. He consequently promoted 
the foundation of Lampeter College in 1827, and there was 
a demand that it should acquire something of a university 
rank. 
The forties saw a great educational revival. At first it 
centred round elementary education, and was led by 
Sir Thomas Phillips of Newport, Sir Hugh Owen, and the 
Rev. Henry Griffiths. In 1846 Owen founded the Cambrian 
Educational Society. As regards elementary education, 
the movement received an unfortunate check through the 
excitement created by the adverse report of a Commission 
on Welsh elementary schools, which was popularly called 
“Brad y Llyfrau Gleision” (the treason of the blue books). 
The movers, however, directed their attention to higher 
education. In 1849 Phillips, in a book called Wales, the 
language, social conditions, moral character and opinions 
of the people considered in their relation to education, which 
is the best authority for the history of Welsh education up 
to that date, urged the foundation of Durham university as 
a claim for the establishment of a university for Wales. 
- Historically the two projects were closely connected, as 
the Commonwealth had conceived them both. Moreover, 
Scotland had four universities and Ireland one. The only
-P-A-G-E-303
  xi] EDUCATION IN WALES 289 
immediate outcome was that Lampeter received the 
privilege of conferring the degree of B.D., an unsatisfactory 
solution, both because the right to grant degrees has else- 
where been confined to institutions of university rank and 
because Lampeter was a strictly denominational foundae 
tion. Shortly afterwards a petition was sent up to Parlia- 
ment by Welsh clergymen resident in Yorkshire for the 
first time definitely demanding the establishment of a real 
university. 
In 1854 Owen called a conference to press for the 
institution of colleges on the model of those recently set 
up in Ireland. This project was temporarily shelved in 
favour of one for founding a training college. The success 
of this appeal showed that popular enthusiasm could easily 
be roused for educational objects. Advocates went round 
the country, eloquently pleading in wayside chapels; 
money poured in freely from poor congregations; and it 
was clear that the rural communities of Wales were as 
zealous for education as the artisans of Glasgow and 
Lancashire. Welsh education was a spontaneous growth, 
owing nothing to the State and little to wealthy manu- 
facturers, but created mainly by country congregations 
or those of small market towns. No sooner had the training- 
college project been realised by the foundation of Bangor 
Normal College in 1852 than the university scheme was 
revived at the Eisteddfod of 1853. At this point the reli- 
gious difficulty entered, Churchmen being satisfied by 
the granting to Lampeter of the right to give B.A. as well 
as B.D. degrees. Owen’s first idea was to set up two 
colleges, one in the north and one in the south; but a site 
at Aberystwyth presented itself and the geographically 
central position led to its acceptance. The College was 
opened in 1872 and prepared for London degrees. Owen 
continued for the rest of his life to be the soul of the 
movement for maintaining the College as he had of that 
for founding it. © :

in none too freely, the number sinking from a maximum 
of 93 to 57, and these coming almost entirely from the 
few neighbouring counties. In 1879 the Welsh members 
therefore brought forward a motion in favour of govern- 
anent aid for Welsh higher education. It was defeated in 
Disraeli’s House; but in the following year Gladstone 
obtained a large majority at the general election. Glad- 
stone was a resident in Wales and knew something of its 
needs.: When Hugh Owen continued to press for an enquiry 
the new government set up a Committee under Lord 
Aberdare to enquire into the whole question of secondary 
and higher education in Wales. The part of its report which 
dealt with schools will be considered when we come to the 
Intermediate Education Act; as regards higher education, 
it reported in favour of setting up two colleges which should 
receive government grants. One was to be in the populous 
industrial area of Glamorganshire; the other should either 
be the existing college at Aberystwyth or a college situated 
in North Wales. The evidence on the matter of a full 
degree-giving university was somewhat divided; but the 
argument which decided the Committee was that Lam- 
peter already possessed this privilege and that Lampeter 
was a denominational institution. They looked therefore 
to a future federation of Lampeter and the two proposed 
colleges into a full university. 
The government adopted the Committee’s proposals as 
to state-aided colleges. Till their site should be determined 
a temporary grant was made to Aberystwyth, and a 
valuable precedent was created which was subsequently 
extended to England. Arbitrators were appointed to 
examine the competing claims of Cardiff and Swansea to 
be the site of the South Wales college. They decided in 
favour of Cardiff, and the college was opened in 1883. 
Twenty-five years later Swansea also established its claim 
that its technical college should be reorganised as one of 
the constituent colleges of the university. North Wales re- 
fused to be satisfied by the existence of a college as distant 
as Aberystwyth and, after the claims of thirteen competing 
towns had been examined, Bangor was selected and the
-P-A-G-E-305

college was opened in 1884. The government grant was 
now withdrawn from Aberystwyth and given to the two 
new colleges; but Aberystwyth fought hard for existence, 
and eventually the government agreed to give a grant to 
all three. 
It is remarkable how rapidly, after one gap had been 
filled, the Welsh educational enthusiasts set themselves 
to discover and fill another. Secondary schools came next. 
The Aberdare Committee had reported that only 1540 boys 
and 265 girls were receiving secondary education apart 
from those in private schools. Excluding Monmouthshire 
which possessed a fine educational endowment, only two 
of the old grammar schools, Christ College at Brecon and 
Friars School at Bangor, and one new foundation, Llan- 
dovery College, were really flourishing. Bangor and Brecon 
both owed their position to Daniel Lewis Lloyd, afterwards 
bishop of Bangor. His career is typical of Wales in the 
nineteenth century, though in England we should have to 
look several centuries earlier for parallels. Born in 1843 
on a farm in Cardiganshire, the most Welsh of all Welsh 
counties, he received his education at the two small schools 
of Lampeter and Ystrad Meurig, went up to Jesus College, 
Oxford, and was appointed curate at Dolgelly, where, 
by one of those curious makeshifts to which the old 
grammar schools had to resort, the curate was also on the 
staff of the school. Lloyd thus drifted into the scholastic 
profession. In 1873 he was appointed to Friars where, in the 
days before the Schools Inquiry Commission, the irremoy- 
able headmaster is said to have flogged away almost all his 
pupils and to have enjoyed a life of leisure to the end of his 
days. Lloyd was at Brecon from 1878 to 1890, and, in days 
before county scholarships, he used to tour the elementary 
schools in search of promising pupils. Enthusiastic, fiery- 
tempered, and forgiving, he knew everything of individual 
boys, to whom he was a hero. Llandovery, now the largest 
boarding-school in Wales, had among its headmasters the 
present archbishop of Wales and the present bishop of 
St David’s. Monmouth School was reorganised as a result 
of the Endowed Schools Act, being one of the six largest 
I9—2

  292 EDUCATION IN WALES [cH. 
endowments on which the Schools Inquiry Commission 
had presented detailed reports. These four schools together 
accounted for two-thirds of the secondary school boys in 
Wales. 
Such a provision for secondary education was obviously 
quite inadequate. Moreover, it was too closely associated 
with the Church of England to satisfy a community where 
the Nonconformist majority was brimful of educational 
zeal. In England the effective demand came from the 
professional classes; farmers, artisans, and shopkeepers 
only began to think of a good secondary education when 
they found a supply offered to them. Hence till 1902 the 
really effective portion of English secondary education was 
modelled on the lines of the reformed public schools. In 
Wales the demand was for something which should form 
the next rung of the ‘“‘ladder” from the elementary school. 
Those were days when every clever and ambitious boy in 
Wales wished to become a minister, and when his success 
in reaching a theological college was the pride of his family. 
In their early days the university colleges were compelled 
to do a large amount of secondary school work: indeed at 
the time of their foundation many persons were inclined 
to regard it as their function to take boys from the ele- 
mentary schools and pass them on to Oxford. The theo- 
logical colleges were obliged to conduct preparatory schools 
of their own. 
~~ The Aberdare Committee came to no very definite con- 
clusions as to the solution of the problem. They were 
anxious that Wales should have equal facilities in the shape 
of first-grade schools with England; but neither commis- 
sioners nor witnesses were clear how such a type of educa- 
tion, which with a scattered rural population necessarily 
involved boarding-schools, could be provided at a cost 
which should be within the reach of parents of moderate 
means. They saw too that the provision of first-grade 
schools only touched the fringe of the problem: and that 
the main demand was for schools of a less ambitious type 
which would be readily accessible to day-pupils in every 
district. Provision for girls was more urgently needed even
-P-A-G-E-307
    XI] EDUCATION IN WALES 293 
than for boys; but the Committee was a little too early 
to adopt the solution of mixed schools. They saw that 
tate or State aid or both were essential conditions of 
financing the schools adequately; but they evidently felt 
that, in expressing such an opinion, they were making an 
unprecedented proposal. 
It was left to the Welsh private members to carry a 
scheme through Parliament. A private members’ bill must 
necessarily be simple and of a kind to appeal to the public. 
The Intermediate Education Act of 1889 fulfilled these 
conditions. It set up a uniform type of schools, not very 
expensive, and numerous enough to be accessible to every 
district. A government bill, embodying the findings of 
a Royal Commission, would probably have been more 
complicated, and would have provided for more differences 
of type; but it is by no means certain that, without the 
light of subsequent experience, it would have provided the 
types which were really needed, and it may be assumed 
with confidence that it would not have made the same 
popular appeal as this easily comprehended measure. 
Provision was to be made by counties. The original schemes 
for the various schools were to be drawn up by three 
representatives of the County Council and two nominees of 
the government. When once the schools were founded, 
they were to be administered by a governing body for 
each school (or pair of schools in cases where the boys’ and 
girls’ schools were separate) ; but all these local bodies were 
to be in some measure under the control of a central 
governing body for each county. Except in populous areas 
the schools were “‘dual,’’ which in practice has come to 
mean mixed. The County Councils were empowered to 
raise a halfpenny rate—the first ever avowedly raised for 
secondary education—and the Treasury was to pay pound 
for pound. By 1895 thirty such schools had been founded, 
and by 1902 the number had risen to ninety-five. Mon- 
mouth, Llandovery, and Brecon refused to give up their 
independence; but the bulk of the older schools voluntarily 
converted themselves into county schools under the new 
act. 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  294 EDUCATION IN WALES [cH. 
The Welsh Intermediate Education Act was clearly a 
model for much of the English Act of 1g02. County 
* Councils received even larger control under that Act; rate 
aid and treasury aid both appear; and the type of school 
set up was meant to be very similar. The faults in the early 
working of bureaucratic administration of education will 
have to be considered shortly: for the moment let us con- 
sider only the benefits which resulted from the creation of 
a new type of school. For the first time schools were 
established whose normal function was to take the most 
promising pupils of the elementary schools, to continue 
their general education, and to pass on those who even- 
tually proved most apt to the local university. When 
Huxley spoke of the “ladder,’’ the metaphor, though 
unintentionally, suggested a strait and narrow way, by 
which elementary schoolboys could singly climb with 
difficulty the ascent to which their more favoured neigh- 
bours could crowd up through a broad staircase. These 
schools provided something more than a “ladder” in this 
sense. The elementary school pupil who comes out top 
of his school finds transfer to the secondary school the 
natural and normal event. The discovery of the nation’s 
brains is no longer left to the merest accident. In rural 
Wales, at any rate, the parent is rare who puts his boy to 
work at fourteen in order to earn an immediate wage if the 
chance is open to him of proving a real success at the 
university. 
It is noteworthy that the whole conception of a series 
of steps from the elementary school to the university is 
of British origin. It was unknown in France and Germany, 
to which English legislators were looking for educational 
models during the period of the Royal Commissions and 
for some time later. If the idea was taken from anywhere, 
it was from Scotland; and, outside the British Empire, the 
only great country where it is to be found is of British 
origin, namely the United States. Democratic education 
is as British as are democratic political institutions. Critics 
of the Welsh system are sometimes inclined to compare its 
efficiency with that of the Prussian system to the detriment 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
x1] EDUCATION IN WALES 295 
of the former. The comparison misses the point. The Prus- 
sian Gymnasium provided a connected secondary school 
course from nine to nineteen. It was bound to teach more 
than can a course which at the earliest begins at twelve. 
But the efficiency was won at the expense of entirely 
debarring the working classes from its advantages. The 
boy who began in an elementary school ended there. It 
was assumed that all boys of a certain social position would 
complete their educational career and that no boys of a 
lower social position would carry it beyond fourteen. Such 
a system made organisation delightfully simple. Latin 
could be begun at nine, French at eleven, Greek at thirteen, 
geometry, algebra, and natural science at the earliest age 
at which experience showed that they could be digested, 
and a ten years’ connected course of history, geography, 
and literature could be so devised that no period, no 
country, and no author of importance should be omitted. 
The elementary school course, on the contrary, cannot be 
arranged for the benefit of the few pupils who will ulti- 
mately proceed to the university. But education needs 
two factors for success, efficient teaching and innate 
capacity. The democratic system widens the area of selec- 
tion so enormously that, even assuming that capacity is 
twice as common among the classes which have pushed 
their way upwards than among the rest of the population, 
this increased field probably secures at least five times as 
large a proportion of able pupils; and, in the long run, this 
will compensate for the shortened period of secondary 
schooling. The pupils transferred from the elementary 
schools start with a handicap which they may not have 
made up by the age of eighteen, but they may easily be 
ahead by twenty-three. 
The use of the term “intermediate school” suggests that 
the framers of the scheme hardly contemplated that the 
schools would be in the fullest sense secondary. It seems 
to have been thought by the Aberdare Committee that 
sixteen would be a usual age for entering the university 
colleges. Experience has falsified expectations. Though 
few pupils remain at school beyond sixteen except those
-P-A-G-E-310
296 EDUCATION IN WALES (cH. 
who are proceeding to the university, yet the age of 
entering the Welsh colleges is now normally exactly the 
same as that which prevails at Oxford and Cambridge, so 
that the future university students complete their second- 
ary school course. 
The establishment of the schools thus soon produced a 
supply of students for the colleges who could at once enter 
on degree courses. It was felt that the time had come for 
the federation of the colleges into a national university. 
From their inauguration Viriamu Jones, the first principal 
of Cardiff, had never lost sight of the idea. On the founda- 
tion of the South Wales College he had relinquished the 
principalship of an organisation in being—Firth College, 
Sheffield—to venture on an untried experiment among his 
own people. He supplied an enthusiasm which never 
relaxed till he worked himself into an early grave. He 
strove vigorously to keep education in touch both with 
large employers of labour and with workmen’s organisations, 
which is as much the secret of success for a college in the 
industrial area of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire as in 
the large towns of the North of England. He fought for 
intermediate schools, for university extension, and for 
the formation of a national university. He held that the 
dependence of the colleges on the external examinations 
of London tended to create a false estimate, in the minds 
both of students and of the general public, of the place of 
examinations in university education. ‘‘We are an over- 
examined people; the bloom of originality is too often 
brushed from an original mind by our examination 
system.” In 1888 a conference of the three colleges had 
already agreed to ask for a federal university on the lines 
of Victoria—the lines which within a few years Victoria 
sought to alter—but except on federal lines it is difficult 
to see how there could have been a university at all. An 
alternative scheme was, however, suggested by R. D. 
Roberts, who held offices in connection with the exten- 
sion work of Cambridge and London, by which the 
university should send forth itinerant lecturers and give 
its degrees to candidates who attended evening classes.
-P-A-G-E-311

It is an idea which London University has more than any 
other been able to attain, and it is an idea of which we 
shall hear more in the future. But it had two great defects. 
First, it is a very different thing to have a university 
throwing out tentacles in all directions and to have the 
tentacles without the university. If either is to be created 
first, it must be the nucleus. Where could the higher work, 
which inspires the rest, go on if the university had no 
local habitation? Secondly, it presumes a university of 
part-time students. Part-time students will be techno- 
logical students, for whom there is no division of interest; 
for they learn by night the principles of what they do by 
day. But the arts or pure science student who is studying 
for half his time is serving two masters—with the usual 
result. It is true that hitherto the extension work has 
been the weak side of the Welsh university; but this is 
possibly a reaction against the movement to make it the 
whole of its work. Lord Aberdare and Viriamu Jones 
fought hard for a teaching university built up on the three 
colleges, and by 1891 their policy was accepted; and the 
charter of the new university received the royal approval 
in 1893. 
With this event the constructive period in the history 
of Welsh education closes and the critical begins. The 
whole organisation existed; it was left to test its working 
by experience and to modify it as that experience sug- 
gested. The criticisms which have been brought against 
the schools and against the university must be considered 
separately. 
Criticism of the schools generally resolves itself into 
criticism of the Central Welsh Board. This body came into 
being as follows. One of the conditions on which the 
government agreed to give grants to the intermediate 
schools was their submission to an annual inspection and 
report. The governing bodies were anxious to avoid too 
rigid control from Whitehall, which still carried the burden 
of Robert Lowe’s sins. In 1892 therefore the Treasury 
assented to the creation of a central board for Welsh inter- 
mediate education, only reserving the right to the Charity
-P-A-G-E-312
  298 EDUCATION IN WALES [cH. 
Commissioners, to whom the board reported, to conduct 
a further inspection or examination if it should seem 
necessary. Viriamu Jones strove hard that the University 
Court should become the central authority, with a view 
to securing the co-ordination of secondary and university 
education. He was supported by the veteran principal of 
Jesus, Sir John Rhys; but the governing bodies would not 
accept the proposal, and in 1896 the Central Board, con- 
sisting mainly of representatives of the County Governing 
Bodies, together with a few representatives of teachers and 
of the University, was set up. There can be no doubt that 
the new body committed the very fault which it had been 
created to avoid; for it tended to regard written examina- 
tions as the one test of the efficiency of a school and to give 
or to withhold grants purely on the results of its annual 
examinations. It had no exact counterpart in the educa- 
tional machinery of other countries, and it seems to have 
interpreted its function as similar to the delegacies or 
syndicates appointed by the English universities for the 
conduct of local examinations. Inspection was wholly 
subordinate, and Wales exhibited the phenomena which 
we have already noticed in connection with England, the 
establishment of a series of examinations—preliminary, 
junior, senior, and honours—the annual testing of all pupils 
except those at the very junior stages, the repeated sending 
in of candidates for the same examination to secure more 
distinctions for the school, compulsion on candidates to 
enter at the earliest possible age, over-pressure, and ill- 
digested knowledge. These evils were accentuated by the 
fact that Welsh pupils are more ready to work and had 
less tradition of “ca’ canny” devices than their English 
cousins, that the very zeal for education among parents 
—who often had never been at a secondary school them- 
selves and had not learned by experience that more 
effective work may be done in seven hours than in eleven 
—increased the danger of over-pressure, and that, most 
of the schools being mixed, the girls were encouraged to 
risk their health and mental freshness by conscientiously 
endeavouring to do what their brothers could only manage

with the utmost difficulty. On the whole, however, these 
evils were first discovered in Wales because State secondary 
education was thirteen years older than in England, and 
probably their discovery has done something to demolish 
the examination fetish in the larger country. 
Another criticism often brought against the Central 
Welsh Board is its supposed neglect of the practical sub- 
jects. This may be partly explained by the bookish con- 
ception of education which prevailed everywhere at the 
time when the Board was set up. The Act defined “‘inter- 
mediate” education as one ‘“‘which includes instruction 
in Latin, Greek, the Welsh and English language and 
literature, modern languages, mathematics, natural and 
applied science, or in some of such studies, and generally 
in the higher branches of knowledge,’ while technical 
education was defined as including “any subject applicable 
to the purposes of agriculture, industries, trade, or com- 
mercial life and practice, including science and art classes.” 
This was the universal conception in 1889. The laboratory 
had taken its place alongside of the class-room; but that 
any true education could come from the saw or the spade 
was undreamt of. But what of art and music? Where 
were ye, Nymphs, when arts which had taken their place 
in the national culture ages ago were omitted? The 
answer can only be found by an analysis of the mixture of 
idealistic and utilitarian motives which influenced parents. 
They did not, as a rule, choose for their sons occupations 
which would bring in wealth; there is much truth in the 
saying that every able young Welshman wished to be a 
teacher or a preacher. Such ambitions may partly arise 
from a desire to escape ‘“‘shirt-sleeve” occupations; but 
they likewise imply in the community which cherishes 
them a respect for the things of the mind. Technical edu- 
cation, which appeals to the desire for wealth, was not 
therefore in great demand; but, among the things of the 
mind, a technical motive was at work, favouring those 
subjects which were needed in the ministerial or scholastic - 
callings; and, as these were precisely the subjects which 
had formed the staple of traditional schooling, they were     
 
-P-A-G-E-314

| 
eagerly seized. When the claims of art, music and hand- 
work as essential elements in the education of the whole 
man began to be pressed both in Great Britain and in 
America, the difficulty that these subjects in no way assist 
the pupil in his subsequent university course proved, in 
Wales as in England, the most serious obstacle to their 
recognition. Neither country has yet solved the problem. 
The literary ideal of education, which in England in the 
past was a peculiar possession of the classes which sent 
their children to schools conducted on public school lines, 
is, however, now so threatened everywhere by the rising 
tide of commercialism, that twenty years hence there will 
probably be no complaint that there are more aspiring 
teachers and preachers than there are class-rooms or 
pulpits to be filled, and a future generation may be glad 
that in rural Wales the old Victorian ideal still persists 
among all classes. 
Wales was affected as well as England by the Board of 
Education Act of 1899 and by the Education Act of 1902. 
The former, by handing over the powers of the Charity 
Commissioners to the newly-constituted Board of Educa- 
tion in London, substituted a real for a nominal master 
over all the Welsh authorities, including the Central Welsh 
Board. The Act of 1902 made the County and County 
Borough Councils, acting through their Education Com- 
mittees, the Local Education Authority for all classes of 
school, and they thus took the place of the old County 
Governing Bodies and often encroached on the powers of 
the Local Governing Bodies. 
The effect of the former change was seen in due course. 
The idea of devolution was in the air; but, whereas in 
regard to things of the body it is very difficult to disen- 
tangle Welsh administration from English (a letter from 
North to South Wales, for instance, goes by way of 
Shrewsbury and Hereford), in things of the mind the 
two countries are very different. Hence there has been 
some tendency to try devolution first in educational 
matters. The Board of Education, which shared with all 
bureaucracies the love of power, cleverly secured it by a

superficial concession to this desire. It established a 
separate Welsh department which turned into a reality the 
nominal powers formerly vested in the Charity Commis- 
sioners; but this branch had no real independence, and 
was under the direct control of the President of the Board. 
The Welsh branch of Whitehall in consequence had over- 
lapping jurisdiction with the Central Welsh Board, and 
‘the question of ‘‘ dual inspection” led to a long controversy. 
Some sympathy can be felt with Whitehall. It had ex- 
perienced a sudden conversion. It was conscious that, in 
its unregenerate days as the Committee of Council, it had 
been given over to the idolatry of examinations. Its 
officials, like all converts, were now the most zealous 
preachers of the doctrine which they had once persecuted. 
Preliminary and junior examinations were hewn down and 
burned in the fire; it was proclaimed as an article of faith 
that two examinations only might be accepted, one at 
sixteen and the other at nineteen; and possibly they were 
feeling their way to see if these examinations might not, 
as in Germany, be controlled by the State. In England 
the old heathenism had plenty of adherents, but no college 
of priests: in Wales the Central Welsh Board seemed to 
occupy the latter position. It was summoned to recant, 
but it took some time to recite the new creed properly. 
The Inquisition began its work; the order of merit in which 
the successful candidates in the honours examination had 
been placed was the first victim; the newly-instituted 
examination between the senior and honours examination 
had a short life; the junior examination was sentenced to 
death but the execution of the sentence was deferred. 
Ultimately the Central Welsh Board subscribed to two 
articles of the new creed; first, that inspection is more 
important than examination; and secondly, that music, 
drawing, woodwork, needlework, laundry, and housewifery 
are canonical subjects in the curriculum. But Whitehall 
is watching it carefully, and any day an indictment may 
be laid against it as a relapsed heretic. 
Meanwhile it was being whispered that the university 
was guilty not only of the worship of examinations but of 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  302 EDUCATION IN WALES [cH. 
another false goddess, Red Tape. On this occasion the 
Board of Education, perhaps from a little uneasiness lest 
it had not cleared its own precincts entirely from the latter 
form of idolatry, did not formally figure at the trial, which 
was carried on before a Royal Commission over which 
Lord Haldane presided. Their report appeared in 1918. 
The difficulties inherent in the federal system, which had 
led to its abandonment in Victoria University, were ten- 
fold greater in Wales. Liverpudlians had urged as a reason 
for separation from Manchester that the time consumed 
in travelling prevented their representatives from attending 
university meetings. What would they have said if their 
only means of reaching a sister college had been by the 
Cardigan Bay Coast route? But there was a reason in the 
case of Wales, which there was not in the case of Victoria, 
why the abandonment of the federal system would have 
entailed a great loss. A federal Victoria embodied no idea; 
the Welsh university stood for the spiritual unity of the 
Welsh people. It was felt that administrative difficulties 
must somehow be got over without sacrificing this ad- 
vantage. The Royal Commissioners seem to have arrived 
at a happy solution. The colleges should be given a large 
measure of independence as regards courses, syllabuses, 
and examinations; and the university should be made 
more than a combination of the three colleges. The reformed 
system of London on its internal side may have suggested 
this solution. The colleges were to be what University and 
King’s Colleges were to London; but there would also be 
a technological organisation for South Wales, an extension 
system, a close connection with the National Library and 
the National Museum, a university press, and a central 
body for arousing and directing interest in national 
archaeology, history, and literature; in fact the university 
should be a brain controlling many limbs. The indepen- 
dence of the colleges would destroy the external character 
of the examinations and would do away with the need 
for much of the “‘red tape”; and the university would be 
set free to devote itself to constructive work. 
The experience of Wales in the matter of her university 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
x1] EDUCATION IN WALES ' 303 
may be of value to England at some future date when she 
seeks to set up provincial colleges for her rural areas. At 
present the prospect of an Eastern Counties University 
with colleges at Norwich, Lincoln, and Ipswich, seems as 
remote as in 1850 seemed the prospect of a northern uni- 
versity with colleges at Manchester, Liverpool, and Leeds: 
but the latter is now a matter of history, and why should 
the former be impossible? Cardiff is of course similarly 
situated to one of the English city universities; but 
Aberystwyth and Bangor have no counterpart in rural 
England. Yet there are indications that the age of great 
towns may be a passing phase. Mr H. G. Wells has seen 
visions of a time when London may be as accessible from 
Exeter as twenty years ago it was from Streatham. Works 
are being built as far away from big towns as conditions 
admit in order to avoid high rents. Electricity will hasten 
the process. Finally agriculture is always bound to assert 
itself. It is the oldest of industries and the most essential. 
And it will be mixed farming. The specialised wheat 
farming of Manitoba will pass away and the mixed farming 
of East Anglia will remain. If any change takes place, 
agriculture will become more intensive and more like the 
garden farming of Japan. Old King Coal reigns only till 
science has found a means to use other sources of energy, 
and who doubts her power to tame them? But Mother 
Earth will be the supply of man’s food till the sun grows 
cold. 
The University of Wales is sometimes accused of not 
being national. Before examining the charge, let us take 
the senses in which it undoubtedly is national. In the first 
place it is closely bound to the rest of the national system 
of education. There can hardly be a parish in the land 
which does not contain one of its graduates and some boy 
or girl who will some day be one of its graduates. It 
presents a goal to which hundreds of lads in isolated farm 
or mountain cottage aspire. It must contain a much 
greater percentage of poor students than the most demo- 
cratic of English universities. Secondly, it is the centre of 
research into the national history, language, and antiquities.  
-P-A-G-E-318
304 EDUCATION IN WALES [cH. 
The contributions of its staff to knowledge contain a high 
proportion of what is specifically national. It is true that 
it is not a wholesale manufactory of bards, but what 
university is? Poeta non fit can be no more overcome than 
the law of gravitation. In the third place it is closely 
bound up with the specific interests of rural Wales from 
theology to agriculture. May we hope that it will, in con- 
sonance with history, develop forestry into a great national 
industry? And it has no firmer friends than the slate 
quarrymen. 
What then is meant by the charge? Sometimes it only 
means that the critic objects to some action of the uni- 
versity and uses “‘anti-national” as the worst name he 
can callit. But the criticism is not all of this kind. Perhaps 
the sense in which the university could be made more 
national is that the people at large should see more of it. 
London University, thanks to the smallness of its academic 
diocese, has been the first to bring its teaching to people’s 
own doors. It is far more difficult in a scattered area. If 
a professor at Manchester or Birmingham announces a 
public lecture, all the constituents of that university area 
can with a short railway journey attend. Aberystwyth 
and Bangor can only solve the problem as Mohammed 
solved it in regard to the mountain. A beginning has been 
made by means of tutorial classes. Sir Henry Jones has 
adumbrated a scheme by which every village shall, if it 
wishes, see a representative of the university. When the 
university is accused of not being national, it probably 
means that the working men want, not merely to know 
that the clever boy of the village is working at one of the 
colleges, but to hear a teacher from that college in their 
own village hall. Let the critics think out a scheme: it 
needs men and money. But it will not be a substitute for 
the present system by which the able boy is removed to 
one of the university towns for eight months in the year: 
it will be an addition. The able boy is needed as one of 
the future lecturers. It is a difficult problem, but, if it is 
ever solved, it will be the finishing touch to the work of 
the university in rural areas.

  CHAPTER XII 
THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 
HE aim of this chapter is to trace the steps by which, 
within the last twenty years, the State has come in 
a large measure to control and to supply secondary educa- 
tion. The central point on which attention is to be fixed 
is the Education Act of 1902. This Act largely carried out 
the recommendations of the Royal Commission which 
reported in 1895, and was anticipated as regards technical 
education by the Technical Instruction Act of 1889. Its 
results need to be traced till we come to the next great 
landmark, Mr Fisher’s Act of 1918. 
Though the Act of rg02 was the first avowed recognition 
of the principle that secondary education is a fitting object 
of public expenditure, the State had in fact, though not 
in name, been aiding secondary education before that date 
in three distinct ways. 
(r) The grants of the Science and Art Department, 
South Kensington, originally meant to help classes rather 
than schools, had come to dominate a whole body of 
schools. It is true that an “organised science school” was 
not necessarily, in the ordinary sense of the term, a school 
at all; in fact, where it was connected with a school, it 
consisted only of a particular department or of particular 
classes of that school. But the system of South Kensington 
grants brought with it the consequence that, provided the 
instruction given in a school was mainly scientific, that 
school was eligible to receive considerable financial assist- 
ance from the State. The only conditions were that the 
parent’s income should not exceed £500 (originally £400) 
a year and that thirteen hours a week (originally more) 
should be given to science. At the time when the Com- 
mission reported in 1895, payment by results in these 
schools was being abolished; henceforth three grants were

to be given—an attendance grant, an examination grant 
which was to be in respect only of the higher courses, and 
a variable grant dependent on inspection and oral examina- 
tion. Inspection was to cover all subjects taught, literary 
as well as scientific. In other words science schools were 
assuming a more definitely secondary character. The past 
system of South Kensington, however, was severely criti- 
cised by the Commission. Their grants had narrowed the 
curriculum and the method of determining them had 
encouraged “‘cram.”’ South Kensington schools “suffer 
from a permanent examination fever1,” and the Com- 
mission recommended that the Science and Art Depart- 
ment, which had since 1884 been virtually independent, 
should be fused with the Committee of Council under the 
new designation of “Board of Education.’’ This recom- 
mendation was carried out by the Board of Education Act, 
1899. 
(2) The Technical Instruction Act, 1889, was another 
means of introducing State subsidies to secondary education 
by a side-wind. It permitted county councils to spend 
money not merely on technical education in the strict 
sense, that is, direct preparation for a specific occupation, 
but on such general education as was necessary to enable 
the pupil to profit by a true technical course. The county 
councils, which had been brought into existence in the 
previous year, were allowed to raise a penny rate for 
technical instruction understood in this broad sense. 
Probably little would have come of the Act but for a 
fortunate accident. In 1890 the government proposed a 
scheme of legislation for the purpose of reducing the 
number of public houses. In order to compensate publicans 
whose licenses were taken away, an additional tax was 
imposed on all alcoholic liquors. The bill imposing the 
tax was passed, but that authorising its intended applica- 
tion met with such opposition from the prohibitionists, 
who would not listen to any proposal for compensating 
the publican, that it was dropped. Parliament found itself 
in the most unusual position of possessing a sum of money

with which it did not know what to do. Arthur Acland, 
afterwards Minister for Education (1892-1895), and the 
leading educationalist on the West Riding County Council, 
suggested in a lethargic and half-empty house that the 
money should be handed over to the county councils and 
ear-marked mainly for the purpose of technical instruction. 
This was agreed to; and the county councils were thus 
enabled, or rather compelled, to provide for technical 
education without the necessity of levying a rate, which 
most of them would have been very reluctant to do. It 
was the experience which they acquired in this branch of 
education which paved the way for their appointment as 
the secondary and elementary education authority by 
the Act of 1902. The sum so handed over every year was 
always known as the ‘‘whiskey money.’’ So curious a 
source of revenue, however, entailed one unfortunate 
result: the funds available for technical education increased 
whenever drinking increased and diminished with a spread 
of temperance, so that, if the total abstainers could have 
persuaded the whole country to “go dry,” there would 
have been no funds left! The Commission found in 1895 
that 93 out of 129 county and county borough councils 
were spending the whole of the whiskey money on educa- 
tion but that in only thirteen cases was a rate levied. Of 
the £317,000 directly administered by county councilst, 
£188,000 was spent on technical education in the strict 
sense, £17,000 was used to subsidise secondary schools, 
£39,000 was given in scholarships, £14,000 went to evening 
continuation schools, and £22,000 was devoted to the 
training of evening school teachers*. No large proportion 
of the money therefore went to aid secondary education 
in the strict sense of the term, but the bulk was spent on 
the education of pupils of secondary school age, not of 
adults; and the Commission notes that county council 
grants had tended to modify the curricula of schools. 
(3) School Boards, chiefly in large towns, though in- 
tended to supply only elementary education, had been led 
1 I.e, not by county borough councils and not handed over to the 
councils of towns 2 Report, p. 35.

by the deficiency in the less expensive forms of secondary 
education to overstep the strict limit of their functions, 
and had set up “‘higher grade” schools. The Commission 
noted that many schools had assumed this name which 
differed from other elementary schools only by charging 
a higher fee!. But the real higher grade schools, of which 
there were about sixty, kept their pupils to a higher age: 
they were in effect what the Schools Inquiry Commission 
had wished to term ‘‘ third-grade secondary” schools. The 
secondary part of their work could as a rule only be financed 
by turning the upper classes into an organised science 
school under South Kensington. The Commission of 1895 
held that higher grade schools could not, ‘‘speaking 
generally, share in the grant distributed by the Education 
Department nor be supported out of the rates, although 
in a few instances this seems to have been attempted ?.” 
But the actual words of the Education Act of 1870 did not 
seem to impose such a restriction, for an elementary school 
was defined as one “‘in which elementary education is the 
principal part of the education given.’’ Acting on this 
apparent permission, the London School Board began to 
use the rates freely for such post-elementary education 
till it was brought to a sudden stop in 1899 by the action 
of Mr Cockerton, the Local Government Board auditor, 
who surcharged all expenditure incurred on pupils over 
fifteen years of age. This decision was upheld by the courts 
in 1900: thus no way was left save by legislation to avoid 
the abandonment of the schools which were already in 
existence. A temporary act was hurried through to allow 
the expenditure for the current year, and the government 
promised to introduce a comprehensive measure dealing 
with the whole organisation of education as soon as possible. 
This was duly brought forward and passed, and became 
the Education Act of 1902. 
Before dealing with this Act, we must, however, return 
to the Royal Commission of 1895, generally known as the

schools were still allowed to charge the difference between their 
original fee and that of other schools. 2 Report, p. 10.

  310 THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM [cH. 
Bryce Commission. The question really before this body 
was whether or no there should be a State system 
of secondary education. It practically reported that 
private endeavour had failed to produce an adequate 
supply. It was true that the Endowed Schools Com- 
missioners appointed under the Endowed Schools Act had 
before their disappearance in 1874 made no less than 902 
schemes for reforming individual schools, and that their 
successors the Charity Commissioners had made an addi- 
tion of 295 schemes. Great improvements had thus been 
effected: for instance, in the West Riding there were 
thirty-six efficient schools (eight of which were first-grade) 
against twenty-eight (of which only three were first-grade), 
mostly inefficient, in 1865. But the deficiency in the supply 
of secondary schools which had been pointed out by the 
Schools Inquiry Commission had only in part been 
remedied. Many of the small grammar schools were 
crippled by lack of funds and some were situated in such 
small places that their removal was desirable. The number 
of secondary school pupils at the outside was not more 
than 2-5 per thousand of the population. It varied greatly 
in different counties, Warwickshire, with the numerous 
schools which had been set up at Birmingham out of the 
King Edward’s foundation, having 5-2 against Lancashire’s 
Ir. Schools were very deficient in the purely agricultural 
areas such as Devonshire, and in such districts education 
was little valued. 
For these reasons they were of opinion that an adequate 
supply of inexpensive secondary schools could only be 
secured by State intervention. They were also influenced 
by the fact that the State was already virtually subsidising 
secondary education of a scientific kind and that thereby 
an unfair discrimination against the more literary type 
of education had come into being almost unnoticed. There 
was in fact a danger of the old grammar schools being 
entirely supplanted by the more modern technical and 
scientific forms of education, and this prospect the Com- 
mission did not welcome. ‘“‘Such schools represent es- 
pecially the tradition of literary education. There is little
-P-A-G-E-325
x11] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 3IL 
danger at the present day that we shall fail to recognise 
the necessity of improving and extending scientific and 
technical instruction. It is less certain that we may not 
run some risk of a lopsided development in education, in 
which the teaching of science, theoretical or applied, may 
so predominate as to entail comparative neglect of studies 
which are of less obvious and immediate utility.” 
There was not entire unanimity in favour of State inter- 
vention among the witnesses. No doubt this was due in 
a large measure to the atrocious policy which the Committee 
of Council had been pursuing in regard to elementary 
schools for the last thirty-five years. Temple, at that time 
bishop of London, and surely a progressive educationalist, 
was so haunted by visions of examinations and payment 
by results that he could not reconcile himself to the change. 
The fact that the responsible minister would necessarily be 
a party politician, coming in and going out with his party, 
did not inspire confidence. Finally there was the fear of 
bureaucracy, that is to say, of the permanent officials 
gathering into their hands more power than was intended 
and, as the Report put it, “managing secondary education 
on the same centralised system as primary.’”’ This has to 
some extent come to pass. Still, the Commission was 
probably right in regarding State control as the lesser of 
two evils, and their prophecy that the combination of 
secondary and elementary education under one department 
would do more to liberalise elementary education than it 
would to mechanise secondary? has, on the whole, been 
fulfilled. Elementary education had grown up under 
government auspices and teachers trembled at the thunders 
of Whitehall; secondary education had been accustomed 
to enjoy independence and continued to assert it. It is 
not often that a change of name brings a change of charac- 
ter; but the Board of Education in its most bureaucratic 
days never converted the negation of education into a 
system, as did the old Committee of Council in the sixties. 
Educationalists were undoubtedly groping for some 
arrangement by which secondary education could be con-

trolled and financed by the State without becoming subject 
to the party system. The Commissioners were clearly aware 
of the difficulty, but they were afraid to face it. This was 
inevitable. Since the war we have become critical even 
of the most fundamental principles of the British con- 
stitution and of parliamentary government. Up to 1914 
they were sacrosanct; every statesman prided himself on 
being constitutional, and it was not likely that any 
reputable politician would undermine the constitution 
for so small a thing as educational efficiency. The problem 
is with us still: it is doubtless responsible for the attraction 
of schemes of devolution to many minds: and it is therefore 
worth while dwelling on the exact nature of the difficulty 
and the form in which it presented itself to the Com- 
missioners. 
It has always been regarded as an integral part of the 
Constitution that departments which spend the public 
money should be represented by a minister responsible 
to Parliament. Under the party system this means that 
the education minister comes into office with his party, 
goes out with it however efficient he may be, and is rarely 
likely to be turned out however inefficient he may be. The 
system, which was designed to secure parliamentary con- 
trol, works out in a manner quite the reverse. The minister 
himself is responsible to Parliament, that is to the party 
whips, who have no interest in real educational efficiency, 
with the result that the permanent officials, who are the 
real authors of educational policy, are responsible to 
nobody. During the war the party system was in abeyance 
and the novel departure was made of appointing a real 
educationalist as President of the Board. The contrast has 
made us realise the loss which education sustained by the 
fact of the first seven presidents having no interest in 
education before they held the post or after they quitted it. 
A proposal was laid before the Commission which, if it 
had been possible to adopt it, would have left State edu- 
cation in educational hands. It was suggested that the 
minister should be assisted by a council composed of 
permanent representatives of the Crown and members
-P-A-G-E-327
  
x1r] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 313 
elected by the universities and the teachers. The Com- 
mission came to the inevitable conclusion that the proposal 
was inconsistent with the Constitution. And indeed it was; 
for either the minister must obey the council or the council 
must obey the minister. If the minister obeyed the council, 
he would sooner or later come into collision with the party 
whips. If the council obeyed the minister, the public would 
in time realise that the party politicians were over-riding 
their expert advisers and would draw their own conclu- 
sions. The only way out of this difficulty would be the 
restriction of the cabinet system, so that such a committee 
could be represented in the House by a chairman who did 
not go in or out with the cabinet. A far more drastic 
remedy has now come within the horizon of practical 
politics, namely to remove education and many other 
matters from the Imperial Parliament altogether and to 
hand them over to provincial parliaments; ‘but it seems 
rash to assume that such local parliaments would avoid 
the party system any more than the Imperial Parliament. 
The Commission went as far as it dared in suggesting 
that there existed a large province in education which lay 
quite outside the sphere of parliamentary politics, viz. all 
that is concerned with membership of the teaching pro- 
fession, with inspection, and with examination, “the 
means by which educational ideals can best be made to 
penetrate the educational machinery, scholastic and politi- 
cal.” So far as this province was concerned, they accepted 
the idea of a council. Such a body would undoubtedly 
have become exceedingly powerful; for, whatever is laid 
down by law, the persons who possess zeal and knowledge 
will, under such circumstances, always be able to win the 
day against those whose position rests only on law. It is 
possible that in course of time nothing would have been 
left to the officials of Whitehall save the working of the 
parliamentary machinery. The ministry and officials, 
however, were careful to see that no such body was set 
up; they indeed permitted two shadows of it, the Teachers’ 
Registration Council and the Consultative Committee, to 
wander like ghosts about Whitehall; but they rejected all

  314 THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM [cH. 
the proposals of the former and confined the latter to the 
writing of occasional reports. 
After discussing the constitution of the central authority, 
the Commission naturally proceeded next to consider the 
local authority. They found that scholastic opinion was 
against all forms of local control, while the administrative 
and political witnesses were all in its favour. Here again 
the teachers’ objection doubtless was that local elections 
were usually conducted on party lines and, in the case of 
school board elections, on denominational lines. But the 
opposite case was well put by one of the witnesses:— 
“While elementary education may properly be imposed 
on a nation, the higher education ought only to be organised 
in response to the people’s demand; hence it ought to be 
mainly under popular control,” and German secondary 
education was in consequence to be regarded as too cen- 
tralised. The meaning we take to be that, if you are starting 
elementary education for the first time in a country, the 
people are ex hypothesi too ignorant to be entrusted with its 
initiation ; but,ifyou have reacheda stage at whichan exten- 
sive system of secondary education is possible, there exists 
ex hypothesi a fair degree of enlightenment. In that case the 
parents have sufficient idea what they desire to doom your 
system to failure if you do not take account of their wishes. 
The Commissioners, however, did not recommend 
handing over secondary education to the school boards, the 
existing authority for elementary education; the majority 
of the witnesses were unfavourably impressed by the 
smaller boards. Nor did they propose any new ad hoc body. 
The bulk of the electors would probably not have voted; 
and nothing expresses the public will less than a body about 
which the public is so apathetic that it will not take the 
trouble to exercise the franchise. Though the Commis- 
sioners were not very explicit, they seemed to favour the 
county councils, reinforced by expert co-opted members 
and possibly by representatives of the central authority 
and of teachers. The assumption that the local authorities 
for secondary and for elementary education would be 
distinct led them into difficulties over the higher grade 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
xu] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 315 
schools which, though doing secondary work, were counted 
as elementary. In the Act of 1902 the Government cut 
the knot by making the county councils the authority 
not only for secondary but also for elementary education. 
The Commissioners were anxious to bring the large 
public schools and other boarding schools under the central 
authority, though their non-local character made it im- 
possible to bring them under any local authority. They 
believed that the best of the private schools would welcome 
inspection if it carried with it official recognition; ulti- 
mately recognition should be made compulsory. To allay 
the fears of non-provided schools, they suggested that the 
education authority should not be permitted to found new 
schools where the existing supply of recognised schools was 
adequate: but they contemplated that a certain number of 
such schools would be willing to be transferred to the 
authority. Unfortunately this part of the report remained 
a pious aspiration. Existing schools were found to have 
the deepest distrust of local authorities and a very limited 
trust in the central authority. Only financial necessity 
could make them part with their independence. The Act 
of 1902 was obliged to omit all reference to existing schools, 
and its effect was thus to remove deficiencies in the supply 
but not to create a true State system of secondary education. 
Much has, however, been done by administrative action 
to bring the bulk of the older schools in return for Board of 
Education grants, which began in rgor, under the central, 
though not under the local, authority. A State system 
cannot, however, be regarded as satisfactory so long as 
the schools which can afford to do so insist on boycotting 
it. They may be few in numbers and some of them might 
reasonably be suspected of doing so from an anti-demo- 
cratic bias: but this is not the case with all, and the 
lamentable fact must be admitted that neither parents 
nor teachers have any great confidence in the State as 
compared with private endeavour. Till the State is capable 
of winning that confidence, it is desirable that it shall have 
rivals to stimulate it by competition; yet it is an unhappy 
sight to see the institutions with the greatest attractions

316 THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM [cH. 
of antiquity and prestige, which moreover educate a very 
high percentage of the most successful pupils, moving in 
an orbit of their own outside what without them can be 
called a State system but cannot be called a national 
system of secondary education. 
As regards government and county council grants to 
the schools, the Commissioners recommended that there 
should be no ‘‘payment by results” and no differentiation 
in favour of scientific subjects. No legislation was needed 
to carry out this part of the report, and action was taken 
rapidly. In 1895 literary subjects were made compulsory 
in organised science schools; in 1897 payment by results 
finally disappeared from elementary schools; and in Igor 
the newly constituted Board of Education began to make 
grants to secondary schools. Schools which did not wish 
to receive grants could nevertheless, by submitting to 
inspection, obtain “‘recognition.’’ We will return to the 
present conditions as regards the number of grant-earning 
and recognised schools later. 
Perhaps the most important recommendation of all has 
been left till last. The establishment of an adequate supply 
of secondary schools and of a system whereby they should 
be financed by public authority was a necessary condition 
of realising Huxley’s ideal of the “ladder” from the 
elementary school to the university. It would be a mistake 
to suppose that there was ever a period when no boys from 
humble homes found their way to Oxford and Cambridge; 
and the success of some of the large town grammar schools, 
such as Manchester, Birmingham, and Bradford had con- 
siderably added to the number in Victorian times. But 
such cases were exceptions. The boy of outstanding ability 
in a large city stood a very fair chance of being discovered, 
in smaller towns he stood little and in rural districts none. 
The mass of pupils whose capacities were well above the 
average but not actually outstanding had few opportunities. 
The establishment of a State system rendered normal what 
had previously been exceptional. The witnesses who were 
examined by the Commission differed as regards the 
desirable number of free places in State-supported schools, 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  xu] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 317 
the estimates ranging from one-third to one-twentieth. 
The Commissioners did not venture to suggest a percentage 
but contented themselves with expressing the view that 
free places should be given to “‘candidates of exceptional 
rather than of average ability.” They discussed the diffi- 
cult problem of the right selection of children aged twelve 
by competitive examination, and had to be content with 
leaving it as a insoluble. Scarcely any witness favoured 
the idea of free secondary education, which, however 
democratic it sounds, means in effect using the rates to 
pay for the education of the prosperous classes. So long 
as enough free places are given, every fee-paying pupil 
increases the total sum available for carrying on the school, 
and the fee-paying pupil is thus rendering an advantage 
to the free-placer. In order to give the fullest share in the 
system to the really poor, what is needed is not so much 
an increase in the number of free places as subsistence 
allowances which will induce the poorest class of parents 
not to refuse the offer of a free place because of the loss 
of wages which their child incurs by remaining at school. 
The chief extension of the free-place system occurred in 
1907, when it was made obligatory on every secondary 
school as a condition of receiving the full government 
grant to admit 25 per cent. of free-placers. The Report of 
the British Association for 1918 contains an interesting 
review of the working of the system, which shows that 
it has on the whole been successful in fulfilling the aims of 
its authors. The few weaknesses which are revealed are 
such as we should expect in the working of any new system, 
and remedies are suggested; but a history of education is 
hardly the place to discuss them. 
The Act of 1902 followed the Royal Commission of 1895 
after a much longer interval than the acts which gave effect 
to the recommendations of the Public Schools and Schools 
Inquiry Commissions. Even so it might have been delayed 
still longer but for the situation created by the Cockerton 
judgment. For the first time elementary and secondary 
education were treated as part of a single whole. The two 
forms of education starting at the two ends had at length
-P-A-G-E-332
318 THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM [cH. 
met in the middle. The elementary school age had risen 
till it had reached fourteen: a type of secondary school 
with a lower leaving age than the old grammar schools 
was now to be founded in considerable numbers. 
As we are only concerned here with the effects of the 
Act on secondary education, we are able to omit all dis- 
cussion of the great controversial feature which alone at 
the time interested politicians and a large section of the 
general public, the clauses which threw the voluntary 
schools on the rates. But, in order to understand the choice 
of the county councils as the authority for both kinds of 
education, it is necessary to refer to their predecessors in 
the sphere of elementary education, the school boards. 
The school board had controlled the education of a single 
town or village; it did not matter whether the town were 
London or whether the village contained only a few 
hundred inhabitants. The big boards worked fairly well, 
the small ones worked badly. In many villages it was 
impossible to find members with any educational views. 
But in any case, if the functions of the local educational 
authority were to be enlarged so as to cover secondary 
education, the smallest area which could be put under 
one authority must be large enough to support a secondary 
school. The smaller boards must therefore in any case 
disappear; but it would have been possible to substitute 
larger ad hoc bodies. But the school boards, which were 
elected on a crude system of proportional representation 
(the single transferable vote not having yet been thought 
of), were generally elected on strictly denominational lines. 
It is true that, once elected, the members usually laid aside 
their theological weapons; but it was feared that, under 
any system of ad hoc election, denominational firebrands 
would be elected rather than educationalists. On the other 
hand the county councils! had been successful in their 
management of technical education, and they were the 
one body in the sphere of local government in which the 
public had displayed any interest and which had attracted

50,000 inhabitants.
-P-A-G-E-333
  XII] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 319 
men of real administrative capacity to stand for election. 
It does not appear at first sight to be a qualification for 
an education authority that its members have been chosen 
not with a view to their educational capacities but to their 
ability in managing roads, police and asylums; but it is 
our English way to adopt lines which appear to work well, 
regardless of logic. In,order, however, to secure that the 
county councils should. ‘not be left without expert advice, 
it was enacted that their powers, other than financial, 
should be delegated to a committee, on which, in addition 
to their own members, they should appoint experts from 
outside, some of whom should be women. The suggestions 
of the Royal Commission as to the representation of the 
Board of Education and of teachers on the committee were 
not carried out by the Act. 
The need of the Act was shown by the fact that up to 
Ig12 the county and county borough councils had founded 
330 new schools and taken over 53 existing schools. It 
stands therefore as a great landmark in the history of 
English secondary education; for by it the two great 
problems of an adequate supply of schools and of trans- 
ference of the best pupils from the elementary schools 
received their solution. This work is permanent. It cannot 
be prophesied with equal certainty that the choice of local 
education authority will stand the test of time; the school 
boards probably felt as secure of their position in 1895 as 
do the county councils now. There are already indications 
of a feeling that local interest is insufficiently secured by 
the centralisation of powers in the hands of a body which 
controls so large an area as the county councils, though this 
danger does not affect the county boroughs. The manage- 
ment of a school should of course largely voice the opinions 
of the area from which the school draws its pupils, but in 
a large county the county council is almost as non-local 
a body as the Board of Education. On the other hand a 
county council is more likely to secure differentiation of 
type than a body which controls only one school; and a 
lesser body is unlikely to found training colleges and schools 
for highly specialised purposes. But many of the county
-P-A-G-E-334
   320 THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM [cH. 
and county borough authorities are on the other hand too 
small for the latter purpose without combination. The 
fact is that the nature of the unit for local educational 
purposes is in each case the result of historical accidents. 
The reader may wish to have some information as to 
the numbers of schools of various types in the year 1912, 
as ten years would appear to give time for the Act to have 
produced its effect and the Act was the pk important step 
towards increasing the supply of schools. It is, however, 
no easy matter to give the desired information. No com- 
plete list of secondary schools exists. The Board publishes 
a list of grant-earning and recognised schools; but half the 
schools represented on the Headmasters’ Conference and 
a fair number of those represented on the Headmasters’ 
Association have never sought recognition, and there are 
besides a considerable number of private schools. The 
number of schools represented on the Headmistresses’ 
Association which are not on the Board’s list is much 
smaller. In practice it is therefore necessary to ignore the 
mass of private schools, except the few which have been 
inspected, and the endowed schools, mostly small, which 
are neither inspected nor represented on any of the three 
above-mentioned bodies of heads of schools. 
The problem is complicated by the fact that there are 
no less than five bases of classification which are of some 
importance: 
(a) According to the sex of the pupils—boys’, girls’, 
or mixed. 
(0) According to the leaving age, where no hard and 
fast line exists, and the most that can be done is to divide 
according as the proportion of pupils over sixteen to those 
between twelve and sixteen is over 25 per cent., between 
25 and ro per cent., or under Io per cent. 
(c) According to their relation to the Board of Education 
—grant-earning, recognised, or independent. 
(d) According to their relation to the Local Education 
Authority—provided, subsidised, or independent. 
(e) According to curriculum, where again no hard and

fast line exists, such as that between Gymnasien, Realgym- 
nasien and Realschulen in Germany. 
(a), (6), and (c). 
The facts for English grant-earning and recognised 
schools are obtained by adding up the schools as given in 
the List of Secondary Schools in England Recognised by the 
Board of Education as Efficient, 1913. The similar list for 
Welsh schools does not distinguish between grant-earning 
and efficient. To give a greater completeness to the list, 
we have assumed that the remaining schools on the Head- 
masters’ Conference would come into the highest class as 
regards leaving age, the remaining schools on the Head- 
mistresses’ Association and half those on the Headmasters’ 
Association into the second class, and the remaining schools 
on the Headmasters’ Association in the third class. But to 
prevent an unwarranted appearance of exactitude we have 
given only round numbers except in the first case, where 
there is not much likelihood of error.

322 THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM [cH. 
It will be noticed that the leaving lee appears to be 
higher in the case of girls than of boys This is partly 
explicable by the deflection of boys from local schools 
caused by the existence of the great public schools and 
is a mere paper result; for in many cases the presence of 
a single additional pupil over 16 is sufficient to remove a 
school from one class to another. But the statistics as 
regards mixed schools and the number of cases, especially 
in the industrial districts, where, of two parallel schools, the 
girls’ is in a higher class than the boys’, show that the boy, 
whose education is thought of by the parent as vocational, 
is taken from school earlier than the girl, whose education 
is regarded as general. It is possible, however, that the 
better diffusion of talent among the teachers in the case 
of girls’ schools, which is encouraged by the non-existence 
of anything corresponding to the large public schools for 
boys, may produce a half-unconscious recognition of the 
great mass of girls’ schools as giving a more valuable 
education. The high leaving age of the small secondary 
schools of rural Wales is noticeable when one goes through 
the schools individually. 
(d). 
The following table shows a classification of grant- 
earning and recognised schools according to the character 
of the governing body.

Of the schools founded by local education authorities 
about one-fifth are boys’ schools, two-fifths girls’ and two- 
fifths mixed. Twelve of these girls’ schools and two of the 
mixed schools come into the first grade as regards leaving 
age. Of the boys’ schools five-sixths are in the third grade;
-P-A-G-E-337
  xu] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 323 
of the girls’ schools two-thirds are in the second grade. 
Taking all these facts into account it is clear that the Act, 
necessary as it was for boys’ education, was still more 
beneficial to that of girls. 
(2). 
The Board, when wishing to give an idea of the curri- 
culum, states what languages are taught. In grant- 
earning schools Latin was taught in 757 schools, Greek 
in 183, French in 879 and German in 273. Another classi- 
fication is into one, two, three and four language schools: 
One language (French, 100) Pas +s. 106 
Two languages (French and Latin, 359) -. S51 386 
Three languages (Latin, French and German, 207; 
Latin, Greek and French, 47) ... 256 
Four languages ver ase one eee occa 7, 
885 
As the first grade recognised and independent schools are 
mainly four language schools, the figure of 137 may prob- 
ably be doubled to reach the number of schools equipped 
on all sides existing in England. 
It will readily be seen from these statistics that we do 
not possess a “system” in the French or German sense. 
State action has supplemented the existing supply without 
interfering with it: but it has secured an adequate supply 
of schools which, though wonderfully varied, appear to 
meet all needs. In time all the great boarding schools will 
probably consent to receive government recognition by 
submitting to inspection; for, as long as they are not 
dependent on government grants, their independence is in 
no way threatened, since, in the highly improbable event 
of the government insisting on changes in curriculum as 
a condition of recognition, they could at once sever their 
connection with the government and, if they carried the 
parents of their pupils with them, the Board of Education 
would be powerless. Till they do so, the hands of the govern- 
ment are tied in taking any action with regard to a very 
different class of school, the inefficient non-recognised 
private school. On the other hand it would be a misfortune 
21-2
-P-A-G-E-338
  324 THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM [cu. 
if the government attempted to crush out schools which 
do not conform to existing conventions, such as Bedale’s, 
by reason of their very originality. Even if some such 
experiments were to be “‘crank schools” in the worse sense, 
it is always possible that here and there one such school 
might reveal lines of future advance. 
The period between the passing of the Acts of 1902 and 
1918 was thus marked more by the silent changes brought 
about by the activities of local education authorities and 
the influence of inspection than by any outstanding 
legislative or administrative change. This is, however, 
perhaps the best point at which to treat the history of the 
various attempts to secure a teachers’ register. 
The idea of a registering authority which should ulti- 
mately fulfil for the teaching profession the same functions 
as those performed by the General Medical Council and 
the Incorporated Law Society for the medical and legal 
professions is as old as the Schools Inquiry Commission. 
In a sense it was more pressing in 1869 than it is at the 
present day, since there were then more unqualified private 
schoolmasters and mistresses. We have seen that the 
proposal to establish such an authority was omitted from 
the Endowed Schools Bill during its passage through 
Parliament. It was revived and strongly recommended by 
the Bryce Commission, and the Board of Education Act, 
1899, provided for its institution. Its subsequent fortunes 
were not happy. A registration council was actually set 
up and a register established in 1g02. It was arranged in 
two columns, one for elementary teachers and the other 
for secondary. The National Union of Teachers objected 
to this division as preventing the transfer of an elementary 
teacher to a secondary school. The Board, rather than 
make up their minds to an amendment of the scheme, 
secured the passage of an Act in 1907 under which they 
withdrew the register altogether. Their action was some- 
what of a shock to progressive educationalists, as it seemed 
to betoken vacillation, the absence of a fixed policy, and 
a yielding to expediency. For some years the Board could 
not be induced to take any further action: they vetoed the
-P-A-G-E-339
xm] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 325 
proposals of the leading teachers’ organisations on the 
pretext that they did not provide for the inclusion of 
certain specialist teachers such as those of domestic subjects 
and of physical training. It was not till rgr2 that a new 
registering authority was set up. It is composed of an 
independent chairman and forty-four members, repre- 
senting in equal proportions university, secondary, 
elementary, and specialistic teachers. At present the 
register is drawn up practically by taking things as they 
stand, a fee of one guinea and five years’ satisfactory 
experience being all that was demanded of existing teachers. 
After 1920 it was intended that no one should be admitted 
unless he should have fulfilled the conditions which the 
Council should lay down; but the war upset the calculations 
of the promoters of the scheme. On the academic side the 
conditions are practically in operation; a degree, the 
Board’s certificate for elementary teachers, or certain 
substitutes for the degree accepted in the case of specialist 
teachers. But the value of the register virtually depends not 
only on the requirement of training from all save university 
teachers, but also on making registration a condition of being 
allowed to teach in a recognised school. Compulsion could 
of course be introduced by stages, e.g. by first requiring 
that a certain proportion of the staffs should be registered 
and afterwards by allowing no new teacher to be appointed 
whose name was not on the register. The next few years 
are likely to see a solution of this long-standing problem. 
The year 1918 stands out as a landmark in English 
educational history. At the very time when the Germans 
were inflicting on the allied armies a series of defeats which 
might well have been regarded as the precursors of the 
subjugation of Great Britain and France to the German 
Empire, the British Parliament was quietly passing 
Mr Fisher’s Education Bill which had been crowded out 
by the Representation of the People Act during the pre- 
ceding session. By the time the check of July had turned 
into a retreat, the retreat into a rout, and the rout into 
the débdacle of November, the Act was on the statute-book. 
The provisions directly concerned with secondary education 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
326 THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM [cH. 
are few. But the requirement of a continuation school 
training till eighteen of all persons who have not continued 
their full-time training till sixteen, or reached the standard 
of a school leaving examination, if it does not exactly make 
a secondary education compulsory on all, at least makes 
schooling during the secondary age compulsory. The Act 
also requires that free places shall be given to all who are 
fitted to receive a secondary education and desirous of 
receiving it; and time will show how far these two pro- 
visions taken together will increase the number of pupils 
in secondary schools. The provisions of the Medical Inspec- 
tion Act are also made applicable to secondary schools. 
By another important Act of the same year provision was 
made for the pensions of secondary school teachers. But 
it is clear that this annus mirabilis marks the opening of 
a new period in our educational as well as our general 
history; and it is not the province of this volume to antici- 
pate the history of this new period. 
The advent of universal schooling is probably the greatest 
fact in the history of that most crowded century in the 
record of human development—the century from 1815 
to 1918. If we look back over the centuries, we seem to 
find a tremendous acceleration in the rate at which progress 
travels. The landmarks of the past—the invention of tools, 
the taming of animals, the discovery of agriculture, the 
invention of writing, the use of metals—stand centuries 
apart. The first millennium B.c. reveals the first consider- 
able acceleration; but the first millennium a.D. is a period 
during which, looking at the whole world, we hardly know 
whether there was advance or retrogression. From about 
1400 A.D. advance has been becoming increasingly more 
rapid. Printing diffused knowledge among the upper and 
middle classes of the Western world; the geographical 
discoveries brought all mankind into a partial contact; 
science began to revolutionise the outlook of the intellec- 
tual classes and the standard of comfort amongst all. 
The world of 1800 a.p. differed more from the world 
of 1400 A.D. than the world of 1400 a.D. from the world 
of 600 8.c. But the nineteenth century seems to have
-P-A-G-E-341
x1t] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 327 
progressed as rapidly as the four preceding centuries. The 
outlook of the educated European began to spread to all 
classes of European society and to a minority of the 
members of races outside Western Europe. Another 
century may see a practical homogeneity of the race. For, 
whatever had been gained up to 1800, was virtually the 
possession of a minority in each country. A bolshevist 
rising in any country of Europe in 1800 would, by sweeping 
away the ‘bourgeoisie,’ have sent back civilisation to 
2600 B.C. in a few months. Not that it would have made 
these countries all that Russia is now; for the unsophisti- 
cated Roman or Greek or Arab would have had a sense 
of moral and social responsibility which the oppressed 
Russian peasant lacks. But the gains of twenty-four 
centuries were stored with the few. The nineteenth century 
has many bad features, obviously bad: its industrial 
system produced a submerged tenth lower in the scale of 
humanity than any large class which existed in England 
in the two preceding centuries; their environment was 
more squalid, their interests lower, their opportunities for 
development more stunted. But it developed the antidote. 
It realised that the civilisation which the intellectual classes 
had developed was maintained by being handed on from 
one generation to another by two means, the printed page 
and a deliberate education. A civilisation based on oral 
tradition and unsystematised transmission might be lost 
as completely as many a civilisation of the past must have 
been lost on the occurrence of some unrecorded Vélker- 
wanderung. Greek and Roman civilisation was not lost, 
because it was written, and became a living force again 
when the Renaissance used the organisation of a systematic 
schooling to spread it. The country folk of Stuart and 
Hanoverian times had undoubtedly a not ignoble tradi- 
tional civilisation; it was on the national ideals of the mass 
of the people that the more self-conscious civilisation of 
the intellectual classes was built up. But the agricultural 
and industrial revolutions almost destroyed this traditional 
civilisation; it was cut adrift from the conscious civilisa- 
tion; class ceased to know class; but for the Wesleyan

movement the religious basis of social tradition would have 
been lost; and there was a danger that a large portion of 
the people would become without tradition, without State, 
without religion, without means of self-expression. Story 
and song, music and dance, worship and patriotism gone, 
what but the primitive instincts is left? Education was 
called in to prevent the loss of what had been before; but 
it was the germ of an advance beyond anything that had 
yet been. It cannot be judged on what it has yet accom- 
plished; for its work is only beginning. It is perfectly true 
that before the nineteenth century there had never been 
a nation all or practically all of whose members could read 
and write; but it would betoken a sad lack of vision to 
think that the nineteenth century produced a nation all 
of whose members were educated. The past century gave 
everyone the tools by which a man can make for himself 
a path to the inheritance of the world’s stored experience 
but it did not teach everyone how to use them. It made a 
good beginning; the results already gained have made 
a new age in the future possible; but it had two tremendous 
difficulties to encounter. The first is obvious; the same 
impetious necessity which brought it into being limited 
its immediate success. It strove to humanise many whom 
industrial and social conditions were dehumanising. The 
second was its confinement to the years of childhood: even 
fourteen was obtained as a leaving age only at the close 
of the century. Childhood can only fone the tools by 
which intellectual education can later be won and form 
the habits on the foundation of which moral character can 
be built. The “teens” are the really formative period 
during which mind and character aeetae the shape which 
they will retain. At present we are in the main a half- 
educated people; with the majority of our countrymen 
education has been broken off in the middle, and only a 
few beyond the age of fourteen can finish their education 
themselves by their own thought and reading and their 
own power of learning from their experience of life without 
further guidance. Unfortunately the dreams of theorists 
in the seventeenth century, that every one is capable of
-P-A-G-E-343
  x] THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM 329 
an equal degree of education, have been shown to be 
fantastic hopes. There is no economic or political impossi- 
bility—the difficulty is psychological. Modern scientific 
research has shown and is showing more clearly every day 
that not only saints and men of genius but men above the 
average in character and ability are born before they can 
be made and cannot be made by the best education unless 
they have been born potentially what they are later to 
become. The progress that has been made in standardising 
the Binet tests has not yet been grasped by the bulk of 
educated people in its full significance: it has shown that 
every child is born with a very distinct limit to his indi- 
vidual educability, and that these limits are in the majority 
of cases lower than the optimists of the past would have 
anticipated. All the more need that distinct ability should 
be discovered, in whatever station its possessor has been 
born, and that all should be educated to the full measure 
of their ability! The twentieth century has awakened to 
its double problem; and the system of free places and that 
of continuation schools have been devised to meet its two 
sides; it will be the task of the rest of the century which is 
still young to work out its full solution.

  CHAPTER XIII 
CHANGES IN CURRICULUM AND METHODS 
HE last twenty years have witnessed more rapid 
changes in curriculum and methods than have been 
seen at any time since the Renaissance. The contributory 
causes have been numerous. In the first place the changes 
in the schools have reflected the advances of the subjects 
themselves and their increasing recognition by the uni- 
versities. Up to the close of the third quarter of the nine- 
teenth century British universities lagged far behind those 
of the Continent in the matter of research; but by the 
beginning of the new century the relation of the universities 
to two at least of the important school subjects, natural 
science and history, had been revolutionised; and geo- 
graphy was rapidly taking its place as a coherent body of 
principles. Secondly, the adoption of new subjects, the 
challenge to existing subjects, and the frequent failure of 
the new subjects to fulfil the hopes which had been formed 
of them—a failure which was generally due to the crude 
mechanical methods by which they were taught—led to 
a deliberate attempt to improve the methods of teaching 
both old and new in order that they might survive in the 
struggle for existence. Thirdly, the growth of non-classical 
boys’ schools and of girls’ schools, for which no traditional 
curriculum existed, compelled educationalists to think out 
the whole problem of intellectual education from first 
principles. The British Association showed a keen interest 
in scientific and mathematical education. The exponents 
of new subjects united the teachers of those subjects into 
societies like the English Association, the Modern Language 
Association, the Historical Association, and the Geo- 
graphical Association, with the double object of spreading 
a conviction of the importance of the subject represented 
by the particular association and of so teaching it as best

to bring out its true value. The older subjects were no less 
eager to maintain their hold, and the Mathematical and 
Classical Associations have very considerably modified the 
spirit in which their two subjects are treated in schools. 
Finally, the measure of State control which has existed 
since the beginning of the new century, though it has not 
originated any new ideas, has exercised an influence in 
levelling up schools which might otherwise have been 
content to remain behind their time, and in particular 
the Reports and Inquiries division of the Board of Educa- 
tion did much to discover what was being done in other 
countries and to give publicity to it by means of the 
Special Reports which were entrusted to the editorship of 
Sir Michael Sadler. These general influences and their 
results will become more apparent if we now examine the 
changes which have recently taken place in the teaching 
of individual subjects. 
Classics had attained the zenith of its power as an 
educative force for the ablest pupils at the top of the school 
much earlier in the century. While “pure scholarship” 
still retained much of its pristine glory, sixth-form classics 
were at the same time made the basis of a comparison of 
the ancient and modern worlds, and thus formed the 
introduction of the adolescent mind to that serious 
reflection on political, moral and economic problems which, 
perhaps more than anything else, is necessary for the 
leaders of opinion in a modern state. But, in the newer 
types of school, the duration of school life and the utili- 
tarian needs of modern society, made a study of Greek 
up to the point when it would yield a return of this kind 
impossible; and it is doubtful whether it could ever do so 
except in the case of the picked pupil. Consequently Greek 
never gained an entry into the new type of school, and 
Latin, deprived of her partner, had a difficult struggle to 
justify her continuance. The entrance requirements of 
modern universities and of various professions demanded 
Latin but not Greek: and for some years, owing to our 
innate British conservatism, this compromise was generally 
accepted. Indeed the coming into being of the Board of 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
332 CHANGES IN [cu. 
Education and the reaction against the narrowness of the 
Organised Schools of Science appeared to give Latin a new 
lease of life, and it became almost a necessity in schools 
receiving a government grant., Up to the War, repeated 
attempts to deprive Greek of its position as a compulsory 
subject at the older universities and Latin at the newer 
just failed to win the day. But it was generally felt that 
the teaching of classics outside the older type of schools 
was unsatisfactory. By the traditional method the first 
three or four years yielded little return. The accidence took 
a long time to master; the differences of construction 
necessitated a long course of exercises in translation out 
of English and of ‘‘made up” matter into English; and the 
fourth year often saw only the power to hammer out 
slowly portions of Caesar and Livy with the aid of notes 
which translated all difficult sentences, even if the pupil 
did not use the further and unauthorised assistance of a 
literal translation. Thus the majority of boys never reached 
the stage when they entered into the mind of a Latin or 
Greek author, or when they derived the real benefit of 
translating English into Latin, which comes of the necessity 
of analysing the meaning of the English with the greatest 
exactitude. 
No mere cutting down of the reduced course was of the 
slightest avail. The full public school classical course could 
be cut down without removing anything essential. Verses 
and Greek prose had long disappeared from the German - 
Gymnasien. But it was precisely in the case of the large 
public schools that no great demand for cutting down 
existed. Verses are no longer imposed on the less able 
pupils; they have become optional in classical scholarships 
and in moderations at Oxford; but they still secure marks 
and give the versifier an advantage. But in the case of the 
reduced curriculum, lack of thoroughness at the initial 
stages virtually excluded the pupils from the power to 
benefit by the later stages. The attempt to do in four hours 
a week for two or three years what had formerly taken 
about twelve hours for four or five years was inevitably 
doomed to failure. Yet all the earlier attempts were to

produce text-books which aimed at following the old path 
but rushing along it at a faster rate. 
Such was the situation when a few individuals seized on 
the ‘direct method” which had already thoroughly justi- 
fied itself in the case of modern languages and applied it, 
mutatis mutandis, to the teaching of Latin and Greek. The 
Perse School, Cambridge, under Dr Rouse, has, since the 
beginning of the century, been the pioneer of the new 
attempt, and the Association for the Reform of Latin 
Teaching the medium for spreading the idea. At the Perse 
and in a few other schools the method has been an un- 
doubted success and it has been shown that, by the new 
method, pupils can be brought even with the reduced’ 
hours to the stage when the classical languages bring real 
returns in greater numbers than under the traditional 
system. But the direct method succeeds at present only in 
the hands of real scholars who are at the same time first-rate 
teachers; and one of the factors in the present situation 
is that the increase in the number of schools in which 
Latin up to matriculation standard is taught has made 
it absolutely impossible for the bulk of them to obtain 
teachers of the class which is needed. In many small 
schools Latin is taught in whole or in part by teachers who 
have taken honours in other subjects or who have not 
taken honours at all. It is thus too soon to decide whether 
the new method will withstand the growing attacks of 
utilitarianism and whether the retention of Latin when 
Greek, from which the full classical course received the 
chief measure of its inspiration, is given up will in the 
long run continue to appeal to the bulk of humanists. It 
is likewise too early to predict whether the abandonment 
of compulsory Greek at the older universities will slowly 
reduce the numbers of classical specialists till the ancient 
languages become merely a part of the professional training 
of the theological student. 
Mathematics stood in quite a different position from 
classics. It is true that the growth of natural science has 
drawn away from the more advanced stages of pure mathe- 
matics many candidates who fifty years ago would have
-P-A-G-E-348
  334 CHANGES IN [cH. 
taken the Cambridge mathematical tripos; but it has 
largely increased the number of persons who need to study 
mathematics beyond the old standard for admission to the 
university. Mathematics enjoys several other advantages; 
it has a natural avenue in the universally taught subject 
of arithmetic, which secures that a pupil whose natural 
ability leads in that direction is almost sure to be dis- 
covered; and, being an exact subject, it is comparatively 
easy to teach at least passably. The methods of teaching 
it have undergone radical changes in the last twenty years; 
but most of them were long overdue, some of them having 
been anticipated in France by two hundred years! The 
reforms in the teaching of elementary arithmetic since the 
days when Matthew Arnold described it as “a special form 
of the science peculiar to inspected schools” belong rather 
to the history of elementary than to that of secondary 
education. More radical was the reform in the teaching of 
geometry which involved the abandonment of Euclid, 
whose text-book had held its own for two thousand years! 
The Port Royalists wrote a revised geometry in the seven- 
teenth century, and Euclid had already been superseded 
in every other civilised country. In Great Britain he 
received his death-blow in a discussion at the British 
Association in 1901. His long survival is probably to be 
explained by the persistence of the idea that the study of 
a work arranged in strict syllogistic form trained the 
pupil in a type of reasoning which could be applied with 
success to every kind of subject-matter whatever. Up- 
holders of this traditional view had failed to disentangle 
the essentials of this training from its non-essentials. The 
rationality of everything in Euclid’s proofs and order had 
been taken for granted: Euclid had become the touchstone 
of reason rather than reason of Euclid. After r901, how- 
ever, it was no longer heretical to hint that Euclid could 
be guilty of a tautological definition, that his postulates 
had been determined more by the build of Greek compasses 
than by that of the human mind, or that some of his 
axioms were less axiomatic than some of the propositions 
which he thought it necessary to prove. Hitherto the
-P-A-G-E-349
xu] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 335 
pupil who began by regarding geometry as a-fascinating 
subject had found his progress barred by the pons asi- 
norum—the cumbrous proof of Proposition V; but this 
terrible obstacle appeared to the innovators merely as 
betokening a naive belief on the part of Euclid that a 
triangle could be turned on its back more easily if a piece 
were added at two of its corners than if it were left in 
splendid isolation. A more coherent course of practical 
work was rendered possible by the discovery that the 
absence of all reference to number was rather a defect 
in the geometrical practice of Euclid’s day than a merit; 
while a far more logical arrangement of the order of 
propositions could be adopted as soon as it was seen that 
there was no logical reason why “theorems” should wait 
attendance on “problems” and that Euclid’s order in the 
first book was hopelessly confusing. The result of the 
attacks was that examining bodies ceased to require 
Euclid’s sequence of propositions and that a variety of 
text-books containing other orders sprang into being. 
Among the reformers there was of course a left and a right 
wing: the left wing allowed more propositions to be treated 
as axiomatic, accepted a few proofs which, though they 
were equally convincing to the pupil, were not regarded 
by Euclideans as conforming to the rules of the game, and 
aimed at reaching more rapidly the propositions which, 
like that dealing with the equality of the square on the 
hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle to the sum of the 
squares on the remaining sides, reveal a relation hitherto 
unsuspected by the pupil; while the right wing changed 
little in Euclid but the order. 
The ‘reformed geometry” has made it possible, as 
Rousseau long ago demanded, to make a class think out 
the propositions as “‘riders,”’ to begin problem work from 
the very beginning, and to substitute a real “feel” of the 
proofs for an empty form of words. The older “‘ geometrical 
drawing” which stood in no relation to theoretic geometry 
has been incorporated. Quantitative problems at the early 
stages make the connection with arithmetic and mensura- 
tion obvious to the beginner. Probably for the average

boy or girl, geometry, so far from having ceased to be a 
training in reasoning, has for the first time come to give 
such a training. But the maintenance of this position 
would involve so thorough an examination both of the 
nature of proof and of the steps whereby the growing mind 
can best be led to feel proof as proof, that it is impossible 
to attempt it here. 
At about the same time changes were attempted in the 
teaching of elementary algebra. The traditional order in 
teaching algebra had been based on the order in arithmetic. 
After an unintelligent manipulation of symbols came the 
“four simple rules,’’ and then and not till then simple 
equations and problems leading thereto, which are the 
first things which reveal to the beginner the raison d’étre 
of algebra and are not treated by him as mere juggling 
tricks. The pedagogic and mathematical absurdity of this 
treatment is well exposed in Dr Adams’s The New Teaching, 
but we fear that reform in the early teaching of algebra 
has not yet made as great strides as in the early teaching 
of geometry. At a later stage the earlier introduction of 
trigonometry and of logarithms and the tendency to re- 
move cumbersome accretions in favour of those parts of 
mathematics which are real ‘‘tools” in the hands of those 
who can use them are the outstanding reforms, just as at 
a still later stage the putting of the calculus earlier in the 
course is a prominent feature in reformed syllabuses. 
Of natural science we have already spoken in a separate 
chapter. It has made rapid strides since the “ eighties,’ 
every extension of schools having added to the proportion 
as well as to the actual number of pupils who make it one 
of their main subjects. It suffered badly from the effects 
of written examinations in the early days; for examining 
bodies had not envisaged the possibility of a subject whose 
very essence consisted of practical work. A strong reaction 
against mechanical memorising produced the atmosphere 
in which the claims of the heuristic method were able to 
thrive. This method differed fundamentally from the 
reforms which have been proposed in other branches of 
the curriculum: the most that can be said against any of
-P-A-G-E-351
xu] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 337 
them is that they require specially competent teachers, 
whereas the heuristic method was based on unsound pre- 
suppositions. It assumed a matured power of holding in 
the mind a large number of considerations to be present 
in a child of ten; and it further assumed that the power of 
balancing those considerations could be learned by practice 
without the aid of imitation. Experience and psychology 
have confirmed the suspicions which those who had a 
practical acquaintance with growing minds all along enter- 
tained that till the age of adolescence science cannot be 
studied scientifically ; while, even in the case of adolescents, 
it is now recognised that the handling of the reins which 
guide each individual in a class so as to encourage intelligent 
guess-work is a fine art too delicate to be reduced to 
formulae!. 
The teaching of modern languages is being absolutely 
transformed by the introduction of the direct method, 
hindered though it is by the lack of trained teachers and 
of Englishmen possessing a good spoken knowledge of 
French and German. The older methods, described by 
Dr Moberley before the Public Schools Commission, have, 
however, not yet been thoroughly driven out. The direct 
method was worked out in Germany during the “eighties” 
and was rapidly accepted in that country and in France; 
but it has been adopted by Great Britain only since the 
beginning of the new century. Probably it is used more 
successfully in girls’ than in boys’ schools, partly because 
women have cultivated modern languages more and partly 
because they are far more ready to give a fair trial to new 
educational methods. 
The term ‘‘ English” covers a variety of branches of the 
curriculum—composition, grammar, and literature. 
The practice of English composition has been fostered 
in many ways. As Arnold treated “translation,” as 
opposed to ‘‘construing,’”’ from foreign languages, it gave 
a training in English expression. Unfortunately, however,

338 CHANGES IN [cH. 
there has been a sad decline in this kind of “translation” ; 
and in many of the newer schools the latinised or frenchified 
English which is used in the Latin or French lesson must 
go a long way to counteract the efforts of the teacher of 
English. The old Latin “theme” was a training in another 
side of composition; for it compelled the pupil to collect 
and arrange his ideas as much as an English essay would 
have done: but in the middle of our period it gave way 
entirely to translation from English into Latin. In sixth 
forms English essays have long been effectively used to 
introduce the pupil to historical, political, critical, and 
other problems: but the traditional essay set to the middle 
forms imposed the task not only of making bricks without 
straw but of combining them into a building without a 
plan. In other words, the pupils had neither ideas nor 
guidance in the art of arranging ideas. External examina- 
tions, however, began to require English essays, and the 
newer types of school had to respond to the demand. 
Cram-books of model essays began to be written, and kinds 
of essays were found to be capable of classification as 
readily as problems on clocks and bath-pipes. Pupils 
preparing for the more elementary public examinations 
were taught to catalogue the parts of an animal beginning 
with its head and ending with its tail or to recount the 
career of a man under headings as precise as those of Who’s 
Who. Variety was slowly introduced; but the discovery 
of the great superiority of French teachers in the technique 
of teaching composition and their surprisingly good results 
has done more than anything to improve the teaching of 
the subject in this country!. 
Much of what is now called English Grammar was taught 
in the old grammar schools as part of the Latin teaching. 
Indeed we are now becoming conscious that most of what 
has passed as ‘‘ English grammar” is merely the terminology 
of Latin grammar transferred to a language which it does 
not equally fit. Matthew Arnold, who was a firm believer 
in the “logical training” afforded by a study of Latin, was 
very anxious to see English grammar taught to all pupils 
- 1 Eg. P. J. Hartog, The Writing of English, 1908. 
   
-P-A-G-E-353
xu] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 339 
who did not learn Latin: Thring todo wrote text-books 
and taught the subject at Uppingham. Modern question- 
naires suggest that it is the best hated subject in the 
curriculum; possibly this confirmed the high opinion 
‘formed of it by the old disciplinarian school of thought. 
Another merit in the eyes of some teachers was that, being 
entirely formal and standing in no relation to the world 
outside the class-room, it did not necessitate any fresh 
reading to keep abreast of the times or to impart freshness 
of presentation. It has now become the natural target 
of all enemies of formalism and believers in making school 
work a live thing. But it has a great measure of support 
from the teachers of other languages, who prefer to ease 
themselves of the grind which might threaten a loss of 
interest to the early stages of teaching French or Latin. 
A practical step was taken in 1909, when the teachers,of 
all languages united to agree on a standard grammatical 
terminology applicable to all languages ordinarily taught 
in schools. This amounted to an agreement that, as far as 
schools are concerned, grammar is merely a body of terms 
used to describe certain phenomena of language and not 
an explanatory science. 
English literature owes its entrance into schools almost 
entirely to external examinations. The older schools 
believed that it could not profitably be taught in class, 
and tried to encourage it by school libraries!, by holiday 
work, and by occasional readings given to a class as a kind 
of hour’s holiday. The need of introducing it seemed 
axiomatic to opponents of classics. ‘“‘Why teach Greek 
and Latin, even French and German, literature, and not 
teach the incomparable literature of our own tongue?” 
It was introduced, and taught exactly as Latin and Greek 
authors were taught. The author was snowed under by the 
notes. The notes, like the classical evuditio of Renaissance 
times, consisted of scraps of isolated information, philo- 
logical, grammatical, historical, archaeological, biographi- 
cal, critical. Rarely has a subject suffered so severely at 
the hands of its friends! In how many children has the

desire to read the English classics been killed by cram- 
ming such matter for examinations! An attempt is now 
being made to improve the teaching by altering the charac- 
ter of eee questions; but it has yet to be shown 
that a vernacular literature is capable of being made an 
exami} ation subject. Teachers are in a dilemma. [f it is 
not ex.imined, while other subjects are, it probably will 
not be taught at all; if it is examined, it follows that it 
will be taught badly. Even in the universities, where it 
now usually forms an honours course by itself, a constant 
struggle is needed to prevent ‘‘English” from becoming 
predominantly philological. 
History was one of the earliest of the new subjects to 
obtain recognition at the universities, and its importance 
was admitted by the old-fashioned headmasters; their 
difficulty was‘that they were not willing, like the supporters 
of some modern subjects, to introduce the subject first 
and find out how to teach it afterwards. The higher stages, 
at which thoughtful essays could be obtained, and the 
lowest stage of all, where history is pure story-telling, soon 
assumed shape: but the middle stages have suffered from 
a fair measure of rote memory-work. Dr Keatinge’s source 
method has in recent times attempted to solve the problem 
of the middle stage, and it has exercised a considerable 
influence on existing methods, though it has not often 
been adopted in its entirety!. 
Geography was long a bye-word as a mere memory 
subject. Its transformation in the hands of good teachers 
since 1900 has been more complete than in the case of 
almost any subject. Much of this is due to the efforts of 
Sir H. Mackinder and the late Dr Herbertson at Oxford 
and to the large number of students who have attended 
vacation classes there and elsewhere. In the preceding 
quarter of a century, the men of science, led by Huxley, 
had done much to develop “ physiography,” which became 
a favourite subject in junior examinations, but they had

effected too great a divorce between the physical and the 
human sides of geography. The neo-Herbartians on the 
contrary tried to correlate geography so closely with 
history as to deprive it of all organic unity; but their efforts 
never got far beyond the domain of theory. The synthesis 
of the physical and the human is the ideal of the new school 
of geographers. Geography affords a striking instance of 
the effect on the teaching of a subject in schools which 
may be produced from the broadening of the subject itself 
by its non-scholastic exponents. 
Drawing entered the lower grades of secondary education 
first and thence climbed upwards. It was as a utilitarian 
rather than as an artistic subject that it first appeared. 
Geometrical drawing was thus in favour; but it was kept 
strangely isolated from theoretic geometry till the last 
twenty years. The story of the mechanical teaching of 
freehand drawing, beginning with straight lines and curves, 
and continuing with the drawing of copies, belongs more 
properly to the history of elementary éducation, as it was 
due to a Pestalozzian tradition and was spread by the 
influence of Kay-Shuttleworth. Herbert Spencer’s attack 
did not finally drive it from the schools for thirty or forty 
years. South Kensington has in the past dominated the 
teaching of the subject. The Public Schools Commission 
held that every boy should be taught either drawing or 
music; but Thring was the first enthusiastic supporter of 
the artistic subjects in the large public schools. Though 
the attitude of educationalists to the artistic subjects has 
now become thoroughly favourable, drawing has still two 
difficulties to face. The first is that, not being a subject 
required for the matriculation examinations of universities, 
many schools allow the pupil to drop it as soon as he 
possibly can and do not treat it with the same seriousness 
as they treat the intellectual disciplines; and this is as 
true of many schools of the new types as of the old-fashioned 
school. The second danger comes from a section of its own 
adherents. Latterly a kind of pedagogic futurism and 
cubism has arisen, which would have us allow children to 
draw unrecognisable daubs without correction as a means
-P-A-G-E-356
  342 CHANGES IN [cH. 
of encouraging ‘‘self-expression.” We might as well en- 
courage unintelligible and ungrammatical English with 
the same object. It is impossible to believe that this craze 
will hold the field for long, though it is obviously popular 
with the lazy teacher who would have the world believe 
that his laziness is an application of the latest educational 
theory. 
Music also owes much to Thring. Few schools fail to 
encourage it either as a class subject or as an out-of-school 
recreation or as both, though, where it is treated as a class 
subject, it, like drawing, often suffers from not being 
a recognised subject for matriculation examinations. 
The manual subjects are beginning to come to their own; 
but naturally we expect to see them more developed in 
elementary, technical and continuation schools than in 
ordinary secondary schools. By a curious irony, they are 
not allowed to benefit by being utilitarian ; for, the moment 
any utilitarian claim is put forward for them, we are told 
that we are converting a secondary into a technical school: 
yet, the moment they are left to stand on their merits as 
a part of the training of an all-round human being, parents 
at once forsake them for other subjects which may in the 
abstract be supported as part of a general education but 
whose appeal to them is purely monetary. Thus, while we 
should have expected every human being to aspire to be- 
come a handy man, no social class seems to favour manual 
training. To the head-worker it seems to have no market- 
able value; andthe hand-workersuspectsit as a surreptitious 
device of the capitalist to prevent his children entering the 
ranks of head-workers. Unfortunately it has not fared well 
in the United States, where Dewey’s idealistic conception 
of the subject had to yield to commercialism; otherwise 
his views would probably in a few years have produced a 
strong impression in this country. 
The improvement of methods of teaching every subject 
is bound up with the question of the training of teachers. 
A short account of the history of the movement in favour 
of the training of secondary teachers is therefore in place 
in this chapter.

xu] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 343 
Training of elementary teachers has long been the rule, 
and it is possible that the more rational opposition to the 
training of secondary teachers, as opposed to that which 
sprang either from sheer conservatism or from the dislike 
of an additional year’s work, sprang from certain associa- 
tions of training in general with the specific methods of 
training at one time in vogue for elementary teachers. It 
is undoubtedly true that training came into existence in 
connection with very mechanical methods of teaching. 
Under the monitorial system, when the teachers were them- 
selves children, nothing but cut and dried methods could 
be taught them; and the object of training was precisely 
the same as that of military drill, to prescribe an exact 
method by which every act should be performed, and to 
turn that method into an automatic habit. Gradually the 
age of teachers was raised till the students were no longer 
boys but men: but still the fearful grind hindered any real 
development of initiative. The student was expected to 
teach all day in school, to prepare his lessons, to undergo 
a course of general study, and to be trained; save for meal 
times, he was at work from five in the morning till bed-time. 
We learn that at one time the method of training was as 
follows:—the student taught each class in turn; he then 
went into the training college and assumed the réle of 
pupil in each class and was taught every lesson in the 
regulation manner; he practised some of them on his 
fellow-students; and at the end he was supposed to know 
exactly what to do in every lesson in every class and to be 
ready to go out and do it. Kay-Shuttleworth, the first 
secretary of the Committee of Council, did much for 
elementary education; in particular he substituted pupil- 
teachers for monitors and tried to increase the number of 
adult teachers. In a private capacity he founded Battersea 
Training College; and he trusted to training colleges to 
improve methods of teaching. But the mechanical side 
of training did not disappear. Kay-Shuttleworth wished 
to follow Pestalozzi, and it was quite easy to interpret 
Pestalozzi’s principles, in the literal sense of his own 
phrase, as an attempt méchaniser l'éducation. Kay-Shuttle-

worth’s conception of method was to reduce every subject 
to its logical elements; in reading you proceeded from 
letters to syllables, from monosyllabic to dissyllabic words, 
andso on. The method was thoroughly unsound, but it lent 
itself to a stereotyped procedure; and such a procedure was 
stamped on training colleges during the critical period when 
elementary education was taking shape in this country. 
It is not our intention to recount the history of ele- 
tmhentary training colleges in any detail; for till 1890 they 
were isolated from the rest of higher education, and con- 
venience suggests that they should be treated along with 
elementary education. Their great defect was the con- 
finement of the instruction strictly to the subjects which 
the student would have to teach; and matters were made 
worse by Robert Lowe who, from motives of false economy, 
would have liked to destroy them altogether, but, being 
unable to do so, forbade the founding of any more and 
limited the curricula of those which existed to little more 
than “‘the three R’s.” Between the time of Lowe and 1890 
the Government once more came to see their necessity; 
and, whereas in early days it was found impossible to fill 
them, the demand now came greatly to exceed the supply 
of places. The old conditions had been far from satisfactory. 
The whole day was filled up; students had no private rooms 
in which to work; there were no facilities for exercise; the 
staffs were composed almost entirely of old students; the 
studies consisted largely in memory-work. The professional 
training was somewhat unreal; it encouraged the cult of 
“talk and chalk”; it was tested by “show” lessons before 
the inspector, in which it was generally believed that the 
best impression was made by choosing a scientific topic 
and working a number of “interesting” experiments which 
the class regarded in the light of conjuring tricks. As such 
lessons were unlikely to be given by the student in his 
subsequent career, there was in this an element which 
struck the outsider as worse than a mistake—as partaking 
of the nature of a sham. 
It must be remembered that the demand for the training 
of secondary teachers began while that of elementary
-P-A-G-E-359
  
  XII] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 345 
teachers was still in this unsatisfactory state. It can be 
readily understood what Temple meant when he said that 
the business of a schoolmaster was “not so much to teach 
as to make the children learn.” He implied that the 
teacher was encouraged to be so active as to leave the 
pupils passive, whereas true education consists in the 
pupil learning how to teach himself. Or again we can 
understand the point of Thring’s dictum, ‘‘ The perfection 
of teaching is that it does not work by a given pattern.” 
The first believers in training among secondary teachers 
were mainly women. There must be some reason for this. 
All the great headmistresses from the very first were in its 
favour; it was long before any prominent headmaster 
supported it heartily. Women as a rule have more of the 
teaching instinct inborn in them than men; hence we 
should suppose that they need training less. Our own 
explanation is this. It was a tradition in the old boys’ 
schools that the headmaster should never be in the room 
to hear one of his staff teach. Women can never hand over 
the reins in that way; many men would say that they must 
be interfering. The headmistress soon found out how badly 
the average beginner teaches—we are not speaking of 
discipline but of actual teaching. They also learned how 
much she improved with a little guidance. Contemporary 
headmasters, never entering a new master’s class-room, 
never realised either fact with equal clearness, but tended 
to assume that; if discipline were satisfactory, teaching 
would look after itself. 
The College of Preceptors was the first body to institute 
lectures on the science and art of education for secondary 
teachers, Joseph Payne acting as professor from 1873 to 
his death in 1876. Cambridge University instituted lectures 
during the eighties, and R. H. Quick, who had published 
his Essays on Educational Reformers in 1868, was invited 
to lecture. This move seems to have been inspired more 
by a desire to satisfy an outcry than by a conviction of 
any good which would accrue. The experiment could not 
be pronounced very fruitful; casual lectures are not 
training, in fact they sin against one of the first principles
-P-A-G-E-360
  346 CHANGES IN [cH. 
which the lecturer would lay down that an art can be 
learned only after practice. Not, of course, the advocate of 
training would add, by unguided practice. Training in 
teaching is like net-practice in cricket under a professional 
coach. The old system of education sent the teacher to the 
wicket without any practice at all; the lecture system 
assumed that discussions on forward and back play (the 
theory of education) and a study of the life of W. G. Grace 
(the history of education) would make a man a cricketer. 
Quick was a man brimful ofideas; but itis doubtful whether 
an ‘educational reformer,” in the sense of a man who 
believes that education is right off the rails and needs 
getting back, was the best choice to commend training to 
a faithless and untoward generation. Such a man is of 
necessity searching for the right methods, sure that they 
- have not been found; whereas a man with fewer alterations 
to suggest but perfectly sure of those few would have been 
more likely to command confidence. 
We therefore think that the credit of being the real 
authors of secondary training in England must go to 
women like Mrs Grey, who founded the Maria Grey College 
in 1877, and Miss Buss, who secured the foundation of the 
Cambridge Training College for Women in 1885. Miss Buss 
foresaw the danger that training would be neglected by 
women whose classes in the tripos would readily obtain 
. them posts and might be confined to such as wished to 
make up in some other way for lack of academic distinc- 
tion. This has been another cause which has hindered the 
progress of training. If the training colleges get only 
inferior material, training will not be justified ofits children. 
It is the same story as that of modern sides; headmasters 
first relegated to them all their less able pupils and then 
demonstrated from the results that modern studies were 
of less educational value than the classics. The spontaneous 
spread of training among women has since been consider- 
able. It is noteworthy too that the schools of the Roman 
Catholics and of the Society of Friends, who are more free 
from tradition and more ready to examine an educational 
question on its merits than ordinary schools, have been
-P-A-G-E-361
  x11] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 347 
favourable to training. Meanwhile the elementary training 
colleges were being transformed. The buildings were im- 
proved; each student was allotted a study-bedroom of his 
own; hours of work were reduced; playing fields were 
attached; the curriculum was widened; students were 
encouraged to sit for London degrees; women principals 
were required in the case of women’s colleges; salaries 
were improved; and the colleges were encouraged to ap- 
point graduates on their staffs. 
An undoubted hindrance to the spread of training was 
a widely felt suspicion of educational theory for which 
some of its exponents were in a large measure to blame. 
It is a curious fact that we have almost completed our 
story of English secondary education during the last 
hundred years without having had a single occasion save 
in a digression on elementary education to refer to any 
influence exercised by the great continental exponents of 
educational theory. The three whose views have in turn 
been brought to Great Britain are Pestalozzi, Froebel, 
and Herbart. As a philanthropist, indeed as a confessor 
for education among the poor, Pestalozzi had an influence 
on the spread of elementary education which is above 
praise. But as a theorist, if indeed he can be called such, 
his influence, as we have pointed out, made for a mechanical 
conception of teaching. Froebel’s work was almost un- 
known in England till the foundation of the Froebel Society 
in 1874. In spite of some tendency to set the ipse dixit 
of their founder above experience, Froebelians have, on 
the other hand, done an immense amount of good, and have 
revolutionised our ideas of the infant school. The influence 
of Herbart was later still in showing itself and coincided 
with the demand for training. The Felkins translated 
portions of Herbart’s writings in 1892, and among a section 
of ‘‘reformers” Herbartianism became a craze. Pilgrim- 
ages to Jena to sit at the feet of Dr Rein, his great con- 
temporary exponent, were as obligatory on the faithful 
as pilgrimages to Mecca in the world of Islam. The arrange- 
ment of lessons in five steps—Herbart himself only knew 
of four—was believed to be all that was needed (unless
-P-A-G-E-362
348 CHANGES IN [cH. 
perchance it were the determination of curriculum. on a 
culture-epoch basis) to bring about an educational millen- 
nium. To the old-fashioned headmaster Herbartianism 
appeared as the very canonisation of soft pedagogics. The 
truth is that very little of Herbart was left in popular neo- 
Herbartianism, which was inextricably intertwined with 
the notions that teaching was a process of exposition in 
which the teacher did all the work and that it must always 
be made, in a crude sense, “interesting.” 
The application of psychology to education was also 
a matter of suspicion to the practical teacher. The reason 
for this difference of attitude between the theorist and the 
practical man is now quite evident. The theorist saw that 
psychology, as being the science of mind, must be the 
foundation of education, which is the treatment of mind, 
just as physiology must be the foundation of medicine. 
But the practical man saw that the rules of procedure 
which he was bidden to follow in the name of psychology 
would not work. How did this contradictory state of 
affairs arise? Simply because psychology claimed to direct 
education before its own foundations were securely laid. 
Till far into the nineteenth century psychology meant the 
faculty psychology of Aristotle. When, for instance, the 
psychologist Bain wrote his Education as a Science, he 
might as well have written an exposition of medicine as 
a science based on the old Greek theory of the four humours. 
Nevertheless psychology, in spite of some wise criticisms 
by Temple in 1858, obtained a lodgment in elementary 
training colleges, but it meant little more than talking 
about everyday experience in a very technical jargon. The 
able student saw through it, while the man of less brains 
became conceited of his fine-sounding phrases. It is 
difficult to fix a date at which psychology entered on its 
modern scientific stage: the transition took place in Ger- 
many; the American, William James, was probably the 
first writer to popularise the new psychology in England; 
and Ward’s article in the Encyclopaedia Britannica is 
usually regarded as the first important exposition by an 
English writer. The overthrow of the faculty psychology, 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
xu] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 349 
however, was not enough to fit the science to be the basis 
* of an educational theory; it rather left a void. Blasting is 
often necessary before the foundations of a building can 
be laid; but it is not usual to say that a house is built on 
a foundation of dynamite. The next stage in psychology 
was analytic, classificatory, and terminological, that is, it 
sought to state the results of common experience in exact 
language before starting to make new discoveries. This 
stage was quite neutral in its effect on education. It might, 
for instance, be psychologically more accurate so to define 
attention as to imply that we are in some measure attending 
every moment of our lives, but it still remained more con- 
venient for the master to rebuke Smith minor for “in- 
attention” than on the more accurately expressed charge 
of dispersed, discontinuous, and fluctuating attention, of 
a low degree of intensity, and only intermittently directed 
on the required object. 
Suspicion of psychology and suspicion of Herbartianism 
became in many minds closely associated; for the neo- 
Herbartians claimed that Herbart had years ago superseded 
the faculty psychology by a new system of his own. 
Curiously enough, headmasters, though reluctant to admit 
that psychology could have any value in the training of 
the teacher, had been always willing to carry on educational 
controversy in terms of the old psychology, which was 
consecrated by the time-honoured authority of Aristotle: 
but the proposed substitute was anathema to them. The 
truth, however, was that the Herbartian psychology, which 
entirely ignored the innate and hereditary elements in the 
human mind and regarded education as a process of intro- 
ducing ideas from without, had never had a wide vogue 
in the country of its origin, and was quite obsolete before 
the educational views of the Herbartians were introduced 
into England. If Herbartianism was the enemy, the head- 
masters might well have regarded modern psychology as 
an ally for purposes of the attack upon it. 
Psychology has now become an exact, constructive and 
experimental science. Its educational bearings are obvious 
at every turn. One caution, however, is still needed. Its 
   
-P-A-G-E-364
350 CHANGES IN [cH. 
work has so far been done, and for some years will prob- 
ably continue to be done, mainly in regard to what we may” 
call the cruder psychological processes—sense-perception, 
imagery, and memory. Only when these have been 
thoroughly examined will the higher processes—conceptual 
thought, imagination, and reasoning—be properly in- 
vestigated. Unless the educationalist is careful, he may 
come to regard the cruder processes as constituting the 
chief subject matter of education, whereas it is the higher 
processes which are its main objective. An instance of 
this tendency is to be found in the extraordinarily crude 
theories of the function of hand-work in education which 
are sometimes put forward on the authority of medical 
men. Then too there is the fact that educational psychology 
is of German origin and that, while German writers are 
unsurpassed. in the collection of evidence, they are not 
equally noted for discrimination as to the relative import- 
ance of the facts which they have collected. The study of 
Meumann’s standard work on the subject, for instance, is 
of doubtful advantage to the student unless his teachers 
encourage him to study the evidence and exercise his 
critical powers continually on the conclusions. Neverthe- 
less, the claims of educational theory can no longer be 
denied; it is impossible to discuss educational questions 
without it; and the alternative to admitting it to a place 
in a course of training would be to shut out educational 
discussion altogether. 
We may now revert to the history of training colleges, 
as we have reached the point when the story of elementary 
and secondary training unites. In 1890 the Govern- 
ment, to meet the lack of accommodation in existing 
elementary training colleges, adopted a suggestion of the 
Cross Commission to found ‘“‘day training colleges” or, 
as they are now termed, training departments, in the 
various universities and university colleges. At first only 
a part of the students studied for their degrees, but in 
1907 it was found possible to insist on this in all cases where 
the department was attached to a university. The pro- 
fessional work, which was the same as in ordinary training 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  xu] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 351 
colleges, was at first done concurrently with the academic 
course, but in rg1r it was postponed to a special post- 
graduate year and the examining was left to the university 
itself. By this time most universities had already estab- 
lished post-graduate secondary training courses, usually 
conducted by the same staff as that which carried on the 
elementary training. A further step in the unification of 
our educational system was taken in the same year by the 
substitution for the old promise, which was not legally 
enforcible, required of every student on entering on a 
course of elementary training, that he would spend his 
whole life in an elementary school—for so it was interpreted 
by the Board—of a legal undertaking to teach seven years 
in the case of a man or five in the case of a woman in any 
grant-earning school, secondary or elementary, or training- 
college. Finally in 1918 students admitted to an elementary 
training department who succeeded in obtaining a degree 
with honours were allowed to transfer themselves to the 
secondary training department, for which the State also 
provides grants. The distinction is thus now mainly one 
between the specialist teacher of older pupils and the 
non-specialist teacher of younger children. 
The Board of Education likewise from its first institu- 
tion set about to liberalise the existing training colleges 
for elementary teachers. The Act of 1902 permitted county 
and county borough councils, singly or in combination, 
to establish or take over training colleges, a concession 
which has secured a supply of places equal to the demand 
and has removed the grievance which was previously 
caused through the bulk of existing training colleges being 
supplied by the Church of England. 
The result of all these changes is that elementary training 
has begun to react on secondary training. In the new 
municipal and county schools, which largely absorbed the 
old higher-grade schools, graduates who had received an 
elementary training began frequently to appear on the 
staffs. Further, as the number of teachers required was 
increased, it became evident that the supply of ‘‘teachers 
by the grace of God” was inadequate to meet the demand;
-P-A-G-E-366
352 CHANGES IN (cH. 
and outside that select band, the trained teacher was found 
to be superior. It is.true that at first his merits wére of 
rather a routine order; he knew how to arrange his facts 
systematically, to give a consecutive narrative, and to drill 
his pupils thoroughly. The old-fashioned training hardly 
gave that power which the ‘teacher by the grace of God” 
possessed, of training the pupil to teach himself, of being 
suggestive rather than didactic. Here, we suspect, was 
the weak spot which men like Thring had detected in 
teaching by rule. The old trained teacher certainly tried 
to “make the pupil think,” he generally believed that he 
had succeeded. But too often he was only exercising an 
art in which he undoubtedly excelled, the barrister’s art 
of driving the pupil by a series of questions to state at the 
end what he wished him to state. As, however, the pupil 
did not know after the cross-examination was over how he 
had been got to the point of that particular conclusion, he 
was no better able by virtue of the process to think out any 
other problem when left to himself. Frequently indeed 
there were serious fallacies in the reasoning which neither 
teacher nor pupil detected. But, in spite of obvious defects, 
it was clear that training could develop potentialities more 
certainly and more speedily than unguided experience. 
The mutual interaction of secondary and elementary 
tradition has been of undoubted advantage to both. The 
former, starting from a basis of small classes and older 
pupils, had laid stress on the work of the individual pupils; 
the latter, which in its early days had mainly to do with 
enormous classes of children aged not more than ten, had 
perfected collective teaching by means of oral exposition. 
Both have their place; and each body of teachers is 
learning to value the side which they had previously under- 
estimated. The secondary teacher has discovered the need 
of thinking out his procedure, of cultivating narrative 
power, and perfecting his explanations; the elementary 
teacher has discovered, especially since a reduction in the 
size of classes permits of less mechanical procedure, that 
methods which originally had children of ten in view do 
too much for pupils of twelve or thirteen. Training is now 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
xu] CURRICULUM AND METHODS 353 
winning adherents among secondary teachers, while the 
ideals of what constitutes a sound training are being 
modified among elementary teachers. 
A cause which is likely in the future to force an accept- 
ance of training even in the most conservative quarters 
is the rise of new methods of teaching old subjects. No 
untrained teacher can hope to teach languages on the direct 
method; and the common-sense of parents sees at a glance 
that a method which enables a pupil to speak, as well as 
to read and write, a living language is superior to one which 
only gives the last two facilities. Often the same parent 
finds that his girl, who is taught by a trained teacher, is 
able to do all three well, while his boy, who is taught by an 
untrained teacher, cannot speak at all and is only able to 
stumble through a piece of translation from either language 
into the other. This is the kind of evidence which appeals 
to the practical Englishman, and it is a kind which head- 
masters will not long be able to resist. 
The history of higher education in this country from 
1800, when we had but two universities and those only just 
waking from a long sleep, nine large schools which were 
still sleeping, and a number of small schools which were 
well-nigh dead, up to 1918, when the number of educational 
institutions has become so great and their character so 
varied that we doubt whether any one person, even an 
official of the Board of Education, thoroughly knows the 
work of them all, surely shows what is the work of the 
State, of the public, and of the individual in improving 
and spreading education. The individual initiates, public 
enthusiasm vivifies, the State spreads. The true function of 
the Government in education is like the irrigation work 
of British rule in Egypt and Mesopotamia; it can control 
a huge system which is beyond the power of any smaller 
organisation. But individuals are the sources of the stream. 
We see this more clearly in the case of schools where even 
the names of the chief initiators are known than in the 
case of universities, the very reason for whose existence is 
that, by bringing individuals together in a small society, 
they may pool the brains of all. We see it too in the case 
A.S.E, 23
-P-A-G-E-368
  354 CURRICULUM AND METHODS _ [cu. xm 
of technical and workmen’s education; it is due to the 
initiating work of Birkbeck, Maurice, Toynbee and Hogg 
that the State has been able to do its later work. But the 
State has irrigated, that is to say, it has, by means of 
Royal Commissions and otherwise, broken down obstacles 
which shut in the life-giving waters of the initiators’ ideas; 
it has financed the construction of channels by which the 
surplus stores of educational talent could be transferred 
from an existing place of education to a region hitherto 
desert ; it has spread the waters from universities to schools; 
it has even by means of reports provided them a channel 
from abroad. But the early attempts at a State-made 
teaching of science show the contrast in vitality between 
the live work of individuals when subsequently spread by 
the State and the sapless skeleton-like growth which results 
from the State’s own work. But besides the individual 
initiator and the State organiser there must exist a public 
to welcome and to demand. It would have been useless 
to provide a complete system of secondary education for 
the rural population of England fifty years ago. Wales 
obtained its system of rural secondary schools first because 
it was ready for it. A demand can probably be created in 
time, but it is a slow process. 
Let us hope that the functions of all three agencies will 
be recognised in the future. Let the State allow such free- 
dom that new educational ideas may be developed by 
individuals. May public opinion not think that, because 
the State has undertaken the supply, there is no more call 
for the enthusiasm which enabled the municipal univer- 
sities, the polytechnics, and the Welsh intermediate schools 
to be founded. And may the State not think that the work 
of extension is done or ever will be done.
